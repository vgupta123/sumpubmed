BACKGROUND
in tropical regions, the availability of forage and the quantity and quality of protein available to ruminants varies depending on the season. brazil, being classed as a tropical region, has two distinct seasons in terms of the availability of feedstuffs for ruminants: the dry season , and the rainy season   <cit> . in the dry season, forages have a high insoluble fiber and lignin content; however, the crude protein content is usually <7%, which is considered limiting for the adequate function of ruminal microorganisms  <cit> . during the rainy season, forages show adequate levels of crude protein, but microbial protein synthesis is limited because of the high degradability of the dietary protein  <cit> . protein supplementation is therefore a widespread practice in brazil to provide a more balanced diet  <cit> . in the dry season, rumen-degradable protein  is provided to animals, whereas in the rainy season, rumen-undegradable protein is added to ruminant rations  <cit> .

dietary protein in the rumen is degraded by the coordinated action of proteases, peptidases, and deaminases, producing peptides, amino acids, and ammonia, respectively  <cit> . most of the ammonia produced is utilized by ruminal bacteria as a source of nitrogen. however, the catabolism of carbohydrates can occur faster than the incorporation of ammonia by rumen microorganisms. ammonia accumulated in the rumen can be absorbed through the rumen wall, and is then converted to urea in the liver and excreted in the urine  <cit> . recycling of urea in the saliva can help to balance the need for nitrogen in the rumen, and previous work indicated that 10–40% of ruminal urea requirements could be supplied through urea secreted in saliva  <cit> .

previous reports have confirmed the role of several rumen bacteria in dietary protein deamination  <cit> . some of these bacteria can also ferment carbohydrates in the rumen . however, these carbohydrate-fermenting species cannot fully explain the deamination rates of mixed ruminal bacterial cultures  <cit> . within the last 25 years, several gram-positive and monensin-sensitive bacteria with high specific activity for ammonia production have been isolated from ruminants  <cit> . these hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria  were initially characterized as obligate amino-acid fermenters, and were found in small numbers in the rumen using molecular probes  <cit> .

the physiological and genetic diversity of hab was further explored by several different groups. mcsweeney et al.  <cit>  isolated a group of bacteria that could grow rapidly on peptides and amino acids, and had proteolytic activity, from the rumen fluid of sheep and goats fed tannin-rich diets based on calliandra calothyrsus. although these bacteria were reported as habs, the level of ammonia and biomass produced in the absence of carbohydrates was often low. the idea that biochemical diversity within the hab group was greater than initially thought was emphasized by the presence of significant populations of habs in pasture-grazed new zealand ruminants  <cit> . this idea was further supported by the work of russell  <cit> , who demonstrated that fusobacterium necrophorum, a gram-negative, nonmotile, and rod-shaped bacterium, degraded lysine with a very high rate of deamination . f. necrophorum was characterized as a carbohydrate-fermenting hab that could produce acetic acid, butyric acid, and ammonia from the fermentation of lysine. further work has indicated that habs are also involved in protein metabolism in other mammals, and could play a major role in human health  <cit> .

however, studies focusing on the isolation, characterization, and quantification of hab in animals fed tropical diets or supplemented with rdp are lacking. the utilization of dietary protein is a major factor limiting productivity in the tropics, and protein is the most expensive component of cattle diets. thus, understanding the role of ruminal bacteria in dietary protein metabolism is essential for developing strategies to improve the efficiency of nitrogen retention in the animal, and to lower the costs of livestock production in these countries.

this work aimed to: 1) determine if there were differences in ruminal bacterial community composition between crossbred nellore steers fed tropical forages, with or without casein supplementation; 2) isolate ruminal bacteria involved in amino acid and peptide metabolism from the rumen of steers, with or without rdp; 3) phenotypically and biochemically characterize isolates with high specific activity for ammonia production; and 4) determine the phylogenetic relationship of these habs.

RESULTS
in this study, we used polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  to evaluate the bacterial community composition of different animals consuming tropical forages, with or without casein supplementation infused directly into the rumen of the fistulated animals. amplification of the 16s rrna v <dig> region revealed a range of 28– <dig> amplicons  that showed low similarity between treatments  and between the animals used in this study. this result indicated that each animal had a different microbial community structure, and the only parameter that grouped samples together was the time of sampling , despite the fact that the ammonia concentration increased by 76%  in the rumen of the animals supplemented with casein.figure  <dig>

because the ruminal infusion of rdp did not cause noticeable changes in the bacterial community composition, we hypothesized that the population of specialized bacteria involved in protein degradation and amino acid deamination was not being accessed by pcr-dgge. to test this hypothesis, we decided to use culture-dependent techniques and enrichments in batch and continuous cultures to estimate the abundance, and to characterize the predominant phenotypes of amino acid-fermenting bacteria from crossbred nellore steers fed tropical forages. a total of  <dig> individual isolates were isolated from fistulated animals, including  <dig> cultures obtained from control animals fed only basal forages, and  <dig> obtained from animals that received casein supplementation in the rumen.

the specific activity of deamination  and total ammonia production of each isolate was determined, and  <dig> isolates showing sad ≥100 nmol nh <dig> mg protein−1 min− <dig> and ammonia concentration ≥25 mmol l− <dig> after 24 h of growth were selected for further characterization. all experiments were performed using trypticase as the sole nitrogen source. morphological analysis of the cultures by light microscopy indicated that the majority of the isolates were motile  gram-positive bacilli , and were able to form spores  . when bacteria were grown in anaerobic mineral medium containing trypticase as the sole source of carbon and energy, the maximum optical density  ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   .table  <dig>

analysis of fermentation products by high-performance liquid chromatography  demonstrated that most bacteria produced a variety of short-chain fatty acids from trypticase fermentation, with a predominance of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and formic acid . the total concentration of volatile fatty acids in individual cultures ranged from  <dig>  mmol l− <dig>  to  <dig>  mmol l− <dig>  . three groups of bacteria, named high, medium, and low fermenters, were separated based on the concentration of fermentation products obtained from trypticase utilization. high fermenters produced, on average,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol l− <dig> of total organic acids from 15 g l− <dig> trypticase , while the average concentration of total organic acids in the cell-free supernatants of medium and low fermenter strains was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol l− <dig> , respectively. the proportion of isovaleric acid in high fermenter strains was  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold greater than in medium and low fermenter strains, respectively, whereas these latter two groups of bacteria had, on average, greater proportions of isobutyric or formic acid in their fermentation end-products. however, the medium and low fermenter isolates r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> did not produce any formic acid from amino acid fermentation. succinic acid was also detected as a fermentation product of some hab isolates, but the concentration was always ≤ <dig>  mmol l− <dig> table  <dig>

because urea supplementation is a common practice in tropical regions, we examined whether the amino acid-fermenting bacteria could also metabolize urea as a nitrogen source. additionally, the proteolytic activity of these isolates was investigated to gain further insight into the range of substrates used by these groups of bacteria. all strains grew when cultured in basal medium containing  <dig>  g l− <dig> of trypticase and  <dig>  g l− <dig> of urea. however, very little ureolytic activity  was observed in washed cultures incubated with 50 mmol l− <dig> urea, suggesting that this is not a suitable substrate to sustain the growth of these isolates . only isolates c <dig>  c <dig>  and r <dig> had ureolytic activities > 10 μmol nh <dig> mg protein−1 min− <dig>  additionally, little growth was observed when the isolates were cultivated with casein as the sole source of carbon and energy, and a low proteolytic activity  was detected in these cultures .table  <dig>

hab species are generally sensitive to ionophores, and the addition of 1 μmol l− <dig> of lasalocid or monensin to the culture medium containing trypticase  drastically reduced  bacterial growth and the consequent accumulation of ammonia  of all isolates tested in this study.

the 16s rrna genes of the  <dig> hab that were selected for characterization were sequenced and compared with known sequences in the genbank sequence database and the ribosomal database project. similarity analysis indicated that identity to the closest match in genbank varied from 73–99%, while hierarchical taxa assignment based on ribosomal database project search results returned hits similar to the genbank at the species level. because the sequence similarity was generally low, it was difficult to phylogenetically match isolates with previously reported bacterial species. however, sequence comparisons carried out against both databases indicated a predominance of bacteria from the order clostridiales.

figure  <dig> shows the consensus phylogenetic tree obtained by bootstrap analysis  considering  <dig> replicates, and many branches were supported by bootstrap values >90%. the strains were grouped into five major clades descending from common ancestors represented as clades 1– <dig> in figure  <dig>  seven hab strains were most closely related to clostridium argentinense , a bacterium that is distinct from c. botulinum, c. subterminale, and c. hastiforme and has been isolated from soil and blood samples.figure  <dig>

clade  <dig> contained eight strains that shared a common ancestor with strains in clade  <dig>  however, hierarchical taxon assignment within this clade was difficult as sequence analysis indicated very low homology  between our query sequences and other 16s rrna sequences deposited in the databases . five isolates that grouped in clade  <dig>  were also only distantly related to other species of clostridium .

eight hab isolates assigned to clade  <dig> were more closely related to well-known ruminal hab  that were phylogenetically grouped within cluster xi of the clostridiales. however, in contrast to previous studies, all isolates within clade  <dig> could ferment carbohydrates as their sole source of carbon and energy. in particular, isolate r <dig> shared 99% identity with clostridium bifermentans , a bacterium that shows arginine deaminase activity and can grow with stickland pairs of amino acids. isolates c <dig> and r <dig> were assigned to clade  <dig>  containing species of fusobacterium, and their closest match in genbank was fusobacterium varium, although with a very low sequence similarity  .

discussion
in this work, rdp  was supplemented into the rumen of nellore steers, and changes in bacterial community composition were assessed to investigate the impact of supplementation on rumen ecology. pcr-dgge and cluster analysis failed to discriminate the genetic diversity of the ruminal bacterial community in control  versus supplemented steers . considering that species richness and population size are both components of diversity, the hypothesis that casein increases the number and/or metabolic activity of the habs, without affecting species richness, cannot be ruled out. this idea is supported by the observation that the rate of ammonia production increased approximately 33% in the rumen fluid of supplemented steers.

previous studies using pcr-dgge demonstrated that grouping of treatments by diet or rumen fraction  is not always possible  <cit> . additionally, individual variation between animals has frequently been demonstrated by dgge profiling and other molecular techniques applied for microbial community analysis, indicating that the bacterial community composition may differ substantially even between animals fed the same diet  <cit> .

to identify bacteria potentially involved in protein utilization and amino acid degradation in the rumen of the steers supplemented with casein, a series of enrichments and isolations were performed in medium containing a mixture of amino acids and peptides, aimed at selecting for specialized populations of anaerobic bacteria that contribute to the metabolism of dietary nitrogen in the rumen. our enrichment and isolation strategy was based on previous observations that carbohydrate-fermenting ruminal bacteria have deamination rates of approximately 20 nmol nh <dig> mg protein−1 min− <dig>  <cit> , while the rates of ammonia production in obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria are at least 10-fold greater  <cit> .

in our study, isolates were selected as hab if the specific activity of ammonia production was ≥100 nmol nh <dig> mg protein−1 min− <dig>  which has been previously reported for bacteria highly active in amino acid deamination  <cit> . a greater deamination activity was not always related to a higher concentration of ammonia in the growth medium, suggesting that these bacterial isolates differ in their ability to tolerate ammonia accumulation.

amino acid fermentation yielded mainly acetic, propionic, butyric, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids , which are produced from the oxidation of carbon skeletons derived from amino acid deamination  <cit> . additionally, the proportion of fermentation products varied considerably among the isolates, with high levels of acetic, propionic, isovaleric, and isobutyric acids. specifically, isolates r <dig> and r <dig> showed fermentation yields with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of isovaleric acid, respectively, a fermentation product mainly related to leucine utilization   <cit> . isobutyric acid was the main fermentation end-product  of isolate r <dig>  and production of this organic acid has been associated with valine fermentation  <cit> .

interestingly, three hab isolates obtained in this work  only utilized amino acids as carbon and energy sources, a typical phenotype of the “classical hab”  <cit> , but most of the isolates with high nh3-producing activity could also ferment carbohydrates . five of these isolates  could ferment hexoses, pentoses, and disaccharides. when eschenlauer et al.  <cit>  screened and characterized culturable habs obtained from the rumen of fistulated sheep,  <dig> anaerobic bacteria showing high rates of ammonia formation in m <dig> medium were isolated. however, only the nonsaccharolytic isolates showed deamination activity in medium containing trypticase as the sole source of carbon and energy. additionally, attwood et al.  <cit>  previously found that hab isolates obtained from the rumen of cattle, sheep, and deer could ferment different carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, cellobiose, xylose, maltose, and trehalose, but the deamination rates of these isolates were not determined. a later work demonstrated that f. necrophorum, a ruminal hab, could utilize glucose, maltose, and galactose, but only if a source of amino acids and peptides  or yeast extract was provided in the growth medium. if these other carbon sources were not present, no growth was observed  <cit> .

considering that carbohydrate-fermenting hab and obligate amino acid-fermenting hab obtained in this study deaminated at similar rates, which has not previously been reported for other hab, it appears that the former group might have a role in amino acid deamination not yet accounted for by previous studies. previous estimates of the ruminal hab population in the rumen varied from <1% to >17%, but these studies mainly used enumeration in selective media containing amino acids as the sole source of carbon and energy, or were based on mathematical models that accounted for ammonia production by specific groups of ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria  <cit> . previous enumeration studies using 16s rrna and protein profiling also indicated that populations of hab accounted for <2% of the total ruminal bacterial population  <cit> . because carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria with high rates of ammonia production were overlooked in these previous studies, their role in amino acid degradation should be assessed to fully explain nitrogen transactions in the rumen. it should also be emphasized that, under our experimental conditions, only 12% of the  <dig> isolates obtained from enrichment cultures had rates of deamination >100 nmol nh <dig> mg protein−1 min− <dig> . nonetheless, 90% of the isolates selected as hab could also ferment carbohydrates in vitro, regardless of whether they were isolated in medium containing  <dig>  or 15 g l− <dig> trypticase or if they were obtained from animals with or without casein infusion into the rumen.

most habs isolated in this study were unable to use casein as a carbon source or grew poorly in the presence of this substrate . assessment of proteolytic activity showed that these isolates were not able to hydrolyze proteins to sustain growth. similar results were observed when the isolates were grown with urea and the ureolytic activity was determined . mcsweeney et al.  <cit>  reported a proteolytic activity of  <dig> u od− <dig> for prevotella ruminicola b <dig>  while other ruminal bacteria had activities above  <dig> u od− <dig>  selenomonas ruminantium growing in  <dig> % urea produced ≥200 μmol nh <dig> mg protein−1 min− <dig>  <cit> , and dupuy et al.  <cit>  reported a ureolytic activity of > <dig>  μmol nh <dig> mg protein−1 min− <dig> for clostridium perfringens. interestingly, until now, most species characterized as ruminal hab showed little or no ureolytic activity  <cit> . in a previous work, flythe and andries  <cit>  isolated habs from boer goats that were closely related to peptoniphilus indolicus and had weak ureolytic activity . ureolytic bacteria could play an important role in ruminal nitrogen metabolism by recycling urea via saliva or the rumen wall, making the amino nitrogen available for the growth of rumen microbes  <cit> .

several bacterial species described as hab  are sensitive to ionophores  <cit> . ionophores modify the movement of ions through the cell membrane, altering proton gradients and energy transduction. in an attempt to maintain ion homeostasis, bacterial cells hydrolyze atp, and this expenditure of energy may reduce biomass formation or cause loss of viability  <cit> . all bacteria obtained in this study were sensitive to the ionophores monensin and lasalocid, even isolates c <dig> and r <dig> that were characterized as gram-negative. this observation is consistent with previous data from russell  <cit> , who reported that fusobacterium could not grow when incubated with 5 μm monensin. these results reinforce the idea that ruminal bacteria with high sad are generally sensitive to ionophores and support previous observations that the presence of an outer membrane alone does not necessarily confer a high degree of ionophore resistance  <cit> .

16s rrna sequencing analysis indicated a predominance of members of the order clostridiales among the bacteria isolated in this study. many isolates were only distantly related to previously reported habs or other known bacterial species , and the phenotypic and biochemical characterization of the isolates set them apart from other well-known habs. phylogenetic analysis separated these isolates into five clades, but phenotypic and genotypic diversity was observed within each group. most isolates were gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria that could grow on carbohydrates and peptides. only isolates c <dig> and r <dig>  were gram-negative. these nonmotile rods could ferment amino acids, hexoses, and xylose, and showed low proteolytic activity. some of these morphological and biochemical traits are consistent with those given for species of the genus fusobacterium, but many other physiological characteristics are not shared with other species belonging to this genus.

these results expand our existing knowledge on the biochemical and genetic diversity of hab, and emphasize the role of carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria in ammonia production in the rumen. to our knowledge, this is the first description of hab isolated from bos indicus, and further studies should investigate the predominance of ruminal habs across different diets and supplementation schemes.

CONCLUSIONS
improving the utilization of dietary nitrogen in the rumen can have a major economic impact on ruminant nutrition. several proposed models of rumen fermentation recognize that ruminal bacteria have different patterns of nitrogen utilization, and that hab appear to account for a large fraction of the amino nitrogen that is converted to ammonia in the rumen, even though they are not highly abundant. although most hab have been described as obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria, the isolates obtained from nellore steers fed tropical forages in this study were also able to metabolize sugars as a carbon source, which is a competitive advantage for niche exploitation and colonization in the rumen. additionally, the biochemical and genetic analysis of these isolates indicated several features that are distinct from previously described strains. considering that habs play a role in the rapid turnover of peptides and amino acids that enter the rumen, and that an optimal balance between protein degradation and microbial protein synthesis in cattle can increase milk production and reduce nitrogen excretion into the environment, strategies to target the habs  might have an amino acid-sparing effect in the rumen.
