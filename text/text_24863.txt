BACKGROUND
cyclic di-gmp  is a bacterial second messenger that is widely utilized by bacteria, with more than 80% of sequenced bacteria predicted to use this signal  <cit> . c-di-gmp controls a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence in multiple bacteria  <cit> . in vibrio cholerae, high levels of c-di-gmp induce biofilm formation, reduce swimming motility, and inhibit colonization in a murine infection model  <cit> . these c-di-gmp associated behaviors are enacted through c-di-gmp binding to a variety of receptor proteins  <cit>  and, potentially to one of two classes of riboswitches  <cit> . intracellular levels of c-di-gmp are controlled through synthesis from two molecules of gtp by diguanylate cyclases   <cit>  and degradation to pgpg or gmp by phosphodiesterases   <cit> .

dgcs are characterized by the presence of a conserved ggdef domain composed of approximately  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . these domains are believed to require the specific amino acid sequence ggef in their active site  in order to retain their enzymatic activity. in addition to their active site motif, approximately 53% of ggdefs contain an rxxd motif  <cit> . the rxxd motif is a feedback inhibition site  located near the active site, which specifically binds to dimeric c-di-gmp to non-competitively inhibit enzyme activity  <cit> . eal domains are one of the two enzymatic domains that contain c-di-gmp specific phosphodiesterase  activity, the other being the hd-gyp domain  <cit> . approximately 67% of dgcs are multi-domain proteins, containing at least one partner domain, with the most common partner domain being the eal domain  <cit> . interestingly, in more than 40% of these eal-ggdef proteins  the ggdef active site is degenerate at one or more amino acids, suggesting that many of these proteins are incapable of c-di-gmp synthesis  <cit> .

one explanation for the high frequency of degenerate dgcs is that these proteins in some cases act as c-di-gmp receptors by binding to c-di-gmp at either their degenerate active site or their rxxd inhibition site. these degenerate dgcs respond to c-di-gmp in several ways. c-di-gmp may mediate participation of the dgc in a regulatory cascade, as does popa from c. crescentus, peld from pseudomonas aeruginosa, and cdga from bdellovibrio bacteriovorus which bind c-di-gmp to regulate cell cycle progression, biofilm formation, and predation, respectively  <cit> . binding of c-di-gmp may be required for proper localization of the protein akin to both fimx from p. aeruginosa and sgmt from myxococcus xanthus <cit> . additionally, degenerate dgcs may also retain other roles independent of c-di-gmp binding. cdpa in v. cholerae requires its degenerate ggdef domain, but not c-di-gmp, to retain its pde activity, and the highly degenerate ggdef domain of yybt from bacillus subtilis exhibited atpase activity  <cit> . in one case, a degenerate dgc has been shown to be active as the pectobacterium atrosepticum dgc eca <dig> retains dgc activity despite having a degenerate sgdef active site motif  <cit> . interestingly, evidence is accumulating that dgcs and pdes themselves form protein complexes, and it is intriguing to speculate degenerate dgcs impact these processes  <cit> .

here we investigate the degenerate v. cholerae dgc vca <dig>  we examined the ability of all 40 v. cholerae dgcs to inhibit motility in semisolid agar, and we determined that vca <dig> was active in this assay. this result was surprising as vca <dig> is a dgc that encodes a degenerate agdef active site. rather than functioning as a receptor for c-di-gmp, our results suggest that vca <dig>  despite its degenerate active site motif, is capable of c-di-gmp synthesis.

RESULTS
census of dgcs that regulate motility in vibrio cholerae
vibrio cholerae strain c6706str <dig> encodes  <dig> ggdef domain containing proteins which potentially function as dgcs. as c-di-gmp represses motility in v. cholerae <cit> , we determined which of the  <dig> ggdefs repress motility in laboratory conditions by individually overexpressing each from a ptac promoter on a plasmid and measuring flagellar based swimming motility in  <dig> % agar plates. we chose to survey the activity of all dgcs using a heterologous expression strategy, rather than mutagenesis analysis, because this approach ensures that each dgc is expressed in the conditions examined. our results indicated that  <dig> of the ggdef encoding proteins significantly repressed motility while  <dig> significantly increased motility . all  <dig> of the proteins that increase motility contain both a ggdef domain and an eal domain. therefore, we hypothesize that these proteins likely possess net pde activity resulting in decreased intracellular c-di-gmp. interestingly, vca <dig> repressed motility  <dig> -fold, yet it is predicted to be enzymatically inactive due to a non-canonical agdef active site. for this reason, we sought to further understand the role of vca <dig> in the regulation of c-di-gmp controlled behaviors in v. cholerae.

the active site of vca <dig> is required for motility inhibition
we hypothesized that vca <dig> was incapable of synthesizing c-di-gmp and functioned as a c-di-gmp receptor protein to repress motility. consistent with previously studied dgc effectors, c-di-gmp could bind vca <dig> at its degenerate active site  and/or its rxxd allosteric inhibition site   <cit> . to determine if the a-site and/or i-site were necessary for motility repression, we mutated the vca <dig> i-site from rxxd to axxa  and the vca <dig> a-site from agdef to agdaf . we also constructed an allele of vca <dig> which contained both the a-site and the i-site mutations . these mutant vca <dig> alleles were ectopically expressed from a plasmid in v. cholerae and then tested for the ability to repress swimming motility . confirming our previous findings, ectopic expression of wt vca <dig> repressed motility 3-fold in a motility assay, as did the positive control qrgb, a dgc from the related species vibrio harveyi that has been shown to be active in v. cholerae <cit>  . the i-site mutant more robustly repressed motility than wt vca <dig>  this result demonstrated that the i-site is not required for motility repression. however, the a-site was necessary for this regulation as expression of both the vca0965-a and vca0965-ai proteins failed to inhibit motility .

vca0965-i induces biofilm formation
like many bacterial species, biofilm formation in v. cholerae is induced by increased intracellular c-di-gmp  <cit> . as ectopic expression of vca <dig> was able to repress motility, we determined whether ectopic expression of vca <dig> would induce biofilm formation. biofilm formation was quantified using two approaches. first we measured biofilms with the minimum biofilm eradication concentration  biofilm assay. expression of the positive control dgc, qrgb, induced biofilm formation four fold above the vector control . although overexpression of vca <dig> significantly inhibited motility, overexpression of vca <dig> did not affect biofilm formation. this result could be due to high-specificity signaling or differential activity of the dgc in these two experiments . in contrast, overexpression of vca0965-i stimulated a 3-fold increase in biofilm formation . analogous to our results measuring motility, overexpression of vca0965-a and vca0965-ai did not induce biofilms. this result indicated that the ability of the i-site mutant to induce biofilm formation was dependent on the presence of an intact active site motif.

to confirm these results, we measured biofilm formation using flow cytometry as previously described  <cit> . this assay measures aggregate formation in liquid cultures, which is driven by extracellular polysaccharide production. analysis of biofilms by flow cytometry was indeed similar to the results of the mbec assay in that wt vca <dig> was unable to stimulate aggregate formation, but the vca0965-i mutant strongly stimulated aggregate formation in an a-site dependent manner .

vca <dig> synthesizes c-di-gmp
the above findings that vca <dig> and/or its i-site mutant were able to repress motility and induce biofilm formation only with an intact agdef active site suggested that vca <dig> was capable of influencing intracellular c-di-gmp levels. to test this hypothesis, we measured the impact of vca <dig>  vca0965-i, vca0965-a and vca0965-ai overexpression on intracellular c-di-gmp levels in v. cholerae using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry . we observed that overexpression of vca <dig> and vca0965-i caused a 4- and 15-fold increase, respectively, in the intracellular concentration of c-di-gmp compared to a vector control . neither pvca0965-a nor pvca0965-ai caused a significant change in c-di-gmp levels when overexpressed, as would be expected if vca <dig> possessed dgc activity . we obtained similar results if these variants of vca <dig> were expressed in e. coli .

it remained possible that vca <dig> modulated c-di-gmp levels by interacting with other components in the cell, although these components would have to be conserved between v. cholerae and e. coli. to further confirm that vca <dig> is an active dgc, we purified vca <dig> and assessed its dgc activity in vitro. due to the fact that vca <dig> is predicted to contain five transmembrane domains that span the inner membrane, it was necessary for purification purposes to construct a truncated version of vca <dig> composed exclusively of the cytoplasmic portion of the protein containing amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  vca <dig> was incubated with  <dig>  µΜ gtp and synthesized c-di-gmp was quantified using lc-ms/ms. both vca <dig> and the positive control dgc, wspr  <cit> , produced c-di-gmp with yields above 90% . lc-ms/ms analysis of vca <dig> revealed small amounts of c-di-gmp even when gtp was not added. the presence of this c-di-gmp is likely due to co-purification of c-di-gmp bound to the i-site as has been previously observed  <cit> . the wspr positive control is an i-site mutant and thus no co-purification of c-di-gmp was observed. we attempted to define the kinetic parameters of vca <dig> but the purified protein was unstable and frequently precipitated from solution, leading to variable results. this instability is likely because vca <dig> is an inner membrane protein and we were only able to purify its cytoplasmic region. nevertheless, these results indicate that even though vca <dig> contains a degenerate active site it is capable of c-di-gmp synthesis.

determining the plasticity of the first amino acid in the active site of vca0965
as a naturally occurring enzymatically active agdef dgc has never been reported, we wondered what amino acid substitutions in the first residue of this active site would maintain dgc activity . to answer this question, we constructed mutants of vca <dig> containing all  <dig> amino acids in the first position of the agdef active site and determined if expression of these proteins in v. cholerae reduced motility . as expected, mutation of the alanine to glycine generated an active dgc which inhibited motility greater than the wt agdef enzyme, although this difference was not statistically significant. although most vca <dig> mutants lost the ability to inhibit motility, mutation of the alanine to histidine and methionine exhibited a significant inhibition of motility greater than 2-fold.

the activity of the glycine, histidine, and methionine substitutions was further examined by determining if induction of these proteins significantly increased intracellular c-di-gmp in v. cholerae. indeed, all three of these vca <dig> mutants significantly increased c-di-gmp when induced compared to the uninduced controls; the histidine and methionine mutations were statistically significant  while the glycine substitution bordered on statistical significance with a p-value of  <dig>  . the ptac promoter used to induce these proteins is leaky accounting for the variation in c-di-gmp levels in the uninduced controls. all four active vca <dig> variants increased c-di-gmp levels by 3-fold. these results indicate that the first position of the vca <dig> active site is somewhat flexible, maintaining activity with four different amino acids.

bioinformatic analysis of agdef active sites
our results studying vca <dig> suggest that the agdef active site is in fact capable of dgc activity. we determined the prevalence of this active site among ggdef proteins using the standalone version of ncbi’s psiblast to scan the  <dig>  sequences of ggdefs in the pfam database  <cit> . we first determined the frequency of the agdef active site motif among ggdef domain containing proteins, and found that approximately  <dig>  percent of ggdefs have an agef active site motif, approximately half of which also encode a rxxd inhibition site . we further found that  <dig> percent of agef proteins originate from vibrios. only about  <dig> percent of the total ggdefs derive from vibrios indicating the agef active site is overrepresented in this genus . finally, we found that the total rxxd motif frequency in ggdef proteins was  <dig> percent, lower than the  <dig> percent frequency reported by christen et al. <cit> , but this could be due to the large difference in database size .

the n-terminal domains of ggdef proteins typically encode conserved domains that are thought to bind environmental signaling cues to control the associated enzyme domain  <cit> . hmm-prot predicts that the n-terminal region of vca <dig> encodes five transmembrane regions with few amino acids present outside of the membrane. to determine the conservation of this domain among ggdef proteins, we queried the ggdefs in the pfam database with the n-terminal region of vca <dig>  sixty-eight sequences were identified with homology to vca0965’s n-terminal region, with sixty-two of these proteins containing an agef active site motif and sixty-three of these proteins originating from vibrios . this suggests that this n-terminal domain is found predominantly in related vibrios and is strongly associated with an agef active site. moreover, this analysis shows that most of the ggdefs encoding the agef active site we identified in table  <dig> are not homologs of vca <dig>  suggesting other dgcs have evolved to use the agdef active site to synthesize c-di-gmp.

discussion
here we show that vca <dig>  which encodes a degenerate agdef active site, is an active dgc that synthesizes c-di-gmp. overexpression of vca <dig> represses motility by increasing c-di-gmp levels in v. cholerae, and the dgc domain of vca <dig> is capable of in vitro c-di-gmp synthesis. to our knowledge, this is the first description of an active dgc containing a naturally encoded agdef active site motif and only the second description of an active non-canonical dgc; the only other example being the sgdef containing eca <dig> from pectobacterium atrosepticum <cit> . eca <dig> regulates type  <dig> secretion and was found to retain a reduced level of activity when the active site was mutated to agdef. interestingly, we observed a loss of activity of vca <dig> when the first position was mutation to serine. this suggests that other amino acids in these dgcs have coevolved to tolerate these non-degenerate substitutions in the first position of their active site.

retention of activity in eca <dig> and vca <dig> is surprising when the steric constraints of the active site are considered. within the active site, the ggdef motif is located in a hairpin  <cit> . c-di-gmp bound at the active site extends over this hairpin, specifically the first g in the ggdef motif. although alanine is a conservative change compared to glycine, we were surprised to find that mutation of this alanine to the less conserved histidine and methionine amino acids maintained an active dgc. we would expect that larger amino acids at this position should create steric interactions detrimental to activity. it is not clear why these amino acids are tolerated over less drastic changes, such as valine, but we predict these differences are driven by specific amino acids flanking the active site in proximity to the hairpin. as both eca <dig> and vca <dig> tolerate non-canonical substitutions to the first position of their active sites, but the amino acids that are tolerated appear to be different, the flexibility of each dgc’s active site may follow its own “rules” and caution must be used when determining if noncanonical substitutions in the first residue of a given ggdef motif render a dgc inactive.

contrary to what might be expected based on the structure of the dgc domain, degeneracy at the first amino acid is quite common among dgcs.  <dig> % of all dgcs are degenerate at one or more amino acids in the ggdef motif  <cit> . of these, almost half vary at only one amino acid and most of these variances occur at the first amino acid  <cit> . the frequency of variance at the first amino acid of the ggdef motif despite the apparent steric limitations of the dgc structure suggest that there may be a high level of variance in dgc structure. our in silico bioinformatic analysis of the agdef motif found that agefs account for approximately  <dig>  percent of dgcs, making this motif fairly common and suggesting that agdefs may have a variant structure that allows them to retain activity. how this variance impacts function remains to be addressed.

finally, we found that although vca <dig> is able to repress motility and increase intracellular c-di-gmp levels when overexpressed, wt vca <dig> did not impact biofilm formation. however, the lack of biofilm induction is inconsistent as we have found that overexpression of vca <dig> led to an approximately 6-fold increase in biofilm formation in another study  <cit> . when biofilm formation was measured using flow cytometry, no increase in biofilm formation was observed—a result corroborated by massie et. al. <cit> . this inconsistency suggests that at the levels we are inducing vca <dig> it is only able to exert a slight effect on biofilm formation which is highly dependent on experimental conditions. these results are consistent with massie et. al. who observed that some dgcs were able to induce biofilm formation at 12 µΜ c-di-gmp, the levels we determined are produced when vca <dig> is induced , while others did not  <cit> . this differential induction of phenotypes by distinct dgcs at analogous concentrations of c-di-gmp is attributed to high-specificity signaling pathways. therefore, it is not surprising for vca <dig> to have an intermediate phenotype. however, removing vca <dig> from feedback inhibition by mutation of the rxxd site increases the activity of vca <dig> allowing it to synthesize higher amounts of c-di-gmp and induce robust biofilm formation when overexpressed.

our results highlight that the first amino acid of the ggef motif should be considered flexible in regards to dgc activity. in combination with the finding for eca <dig>  a more accurate description of a functional active site should be gef. however, whether enzymes which naturally encode a ggef will retain dgc activity upon substitution of the first glycine to serine or alanine remains to be determined. it is possible that intragenic epistatic interactions are necessary for these alterations of the first amino acid to remain functional. additional non-canonical active site motifs should be assayed to determine if enzymatic activity of these dgcs is widespread. furthermore, structural analysis of eca <dig> and vca <dig> can highlight how variance at the first amino acid of the ggdef motif can accommodate dgc activity.

CONCLUSIONS
the research presented here shows that the agdef containing vibrio cholerae dgc, vca <dig>  is able to synthesize c-di-gmp to control motility and biofilm formation. moreover, we found that addition of three other amino acids, glycine, methionine, and histidine, maintained dgc activity. our results illustrate that the first residue of the ggef active site in dgcs is more flexible to substitutions than previously appreciated. as many dgcs encode non-canonical amino acids at this position, caution must be used when determining the activity of these enzymes. whether or not substitution of non-canonical amino acids at the first position of the active site has important functional consequences on dgc activity remains to be explored.
