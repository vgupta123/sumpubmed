BACKGROUND
emerging environmental issues raised due to combustion of petroleum-based fossil fuel and emission of toxic gases have diverted the attention of scientists and researchers towards the utilization of various renewable resources for the production of bioethanol. in addition to these global concerns, other important factors that have been kept in preference are the mounting prices of the fuels and the current political scenario among the oil producing nations. bioprocessing of renewable resources available in a particular region can help in resolving these issues. various renewable resources in terms of agricultural biomass have been investigated for the production of bioethanol and this development proved beneficent for the biotechnological industries. amongst various starchy materials available throughout the world; corn, sugarcane, wheat, potato  <cit> , corn stover  <cit> , molasses  <cit>  and purified starch  <cit>  have been successfully utilized for the commercial production of bioethanol. as the demand and the cost of these starchy crop materials is increasing day by day, it has become indispensible to use substitute raw resources.

cassava is a tropical root crop which is an economically available fermentable source and is produced by numerous countries  <cit> . it is incorporated into animal feed  and about similar proportion is converted into starch for industrial purposes whereas; some of the portion is also used as food source in several developing countries. about  <dig>  to  <dig> % starch content is recovered from the cassava root and due to the low ash content and rich organic nature it can be used as an ideal substrate for bioethanol production  <cit> . in addition, it can also be easily hydrolyzed by various techniques. as cassava starch does not have much industrial application in food industries as compared to corn starch, therefore it also lacks competition in terms of price and is available throughout the year due to its flexibility in terms of planting and harvesting  <cit> .

in recent years, bioprocessing of various value-added products using microbial factories have been potentially explored with reference to extracellular enzymes. agricultural biomass used as a substrate for the production of bioethanol has several limitations including high fiber content which requires high temperature for hydrolysis and this energy intensive procedure also does not provide desired yields of fermentable sugars. hydrolysis of lingocellulosic mass by other expensive pre-treatment techniques is also time consuming. industries also have concerns regarding the availability of the biomass throughout the year and most of the time its storage in bulk quantities is not possible due to space shortage. the development of an ideal pre-treatment method for hydrolyzing poly-phenolic lignin in the feedstock is expensive with several aforementioned limitations thus, enzymatic treatment is more preferable. conventional method used for the production of bioethanol from cassava starch usually requires the basic gelatinization step followed by liquefaction and saccharification. the sugar formed during these processes is further fermented using either yeast or bacteria. since, starch derived from any plant source is a complex molecule, it require various hydrolytic enzymes for its conversion into simple fermentable sugars. among many extracellular hydrolases available, microbial amylases are frequently used for its conversion. for commercial production of amylases aspergillus and rhizopus species are considered most significant sources because the enzymes from these sources are generally thermostable and are available in excessive quantities  <cit> .

despite several advantages of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation using multiple organisms, there are also few shortcomings. in the initial steps, the amylolytic enzymes are produced using fungi and the starch present in the medium is allowed to hydrolyze into simpler sugars and afterwards another microbial factory  is incorporated in the same fermentation flask to produce ethanol. in this case the primary organism  along with amylolytic enzymes also excretes other toxic substances and proteases which in result inhibit the growth and performance of the second ethanol-producing microorganism. along with this, the establishment of appropriate temperature for starch hydrolysis, enzymatic activity and ethanol production also plays an important role. current research deals with the production of bioethanol from hydrolysis of an inexpensive renewable resource known as cassava starch, which is commonly available in pakistan. the methodology used for the production of ethanol was based on double fermentation technique using partially purified fungal amylolytic enzymes for the liquefaction and saccharification of this starchy material. keeping all disadvantages in view, this study was designed in two separate steps. in first step, amylolytic enzymes  were produced using indigenously isolated filamentous fungi and were partially purified to hydrolyze cassava starch into simple fermentable sugars. in the next step, the sugar cocktail was fermented using s. cerevisiae to acquire maximum bioethanol yield.

RESULTS
in the present study, several different fungal isolates with amylolytic activities were purified from different soil samples and preliminary identification was based on microbiological studies including cultural and microscopic characterization followed by 18s rdna sequence analysis. colonial and microscopic characteristics indicate that all isolates belong to genera aspergillus. microscopic morphology of a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> showed columnar and uniseriate conidial heads while, conidiophores are short and smooth. on the other hand, a. niger kibge-ib <dig> showed large, globose, dark brown conidial heads with hyaline and smooth conidiophores. likewise, conidial heads of a. flavus kibge-ib <dig> are radiate and biseriate whereas, conidiophores are hyaline and coarsely roughened. a. terreus kibge-ib <dig> has biseriate and globose conidia with hyaline and smooth conidiophores. a. versicolor kibge-ib <dig> showed centrally rising, velvety floccose and slightly blue-green color colony on pda with conidiophores borne from surface or aerial hyphae.

screening of amylolytic property of the strains was based on starch hydrolysis method. initially,  <dig> fungal strains were selected and among them  <dig> filamentous fungi including a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig>  a. flavus kibge-ib <dig>  a. terreus kibge-ib <dig>  a. niger kibge-ib <dig> and a. versicolor kibge-ib37showed production for amylolytic enzymes. when these isolates were cultivated in the starch containing production medium, highest titers of α-amylase  and amyloglucosidase  were produced by a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> . this strain was also capable of producing considerable amount of glucose  which can be used for the production of ethanol. the fermentable sugar produced by this isolate can be easily metabolized by s. cerevisiae. however, other filamentous fungi produced lower titers of both α-amylase and amyloglucosidase along with lower concentration of glucose. although maximum α-amylase was produced by a. flavus kibge-ib <dig> but it did not showed higher glucose formation rate as compared to a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> therefore, this isolate was selected for further studies.

optimization of various cultivation parameters plays an important role. for effective bioethanol production, fermentation time of the microbial culture and the type of the renewable carbon source used for the production of starch hydrolyzing enzymes and ethanol are among the most important factors. the aforementioned factors will ultimately direct the overall process cost for the development or the scale up of a new methodology in any bioethanol producing industry. hence, fermentation time for the production of α-amylase and amyloglucosidase and different types of carbon sources were studied. varieties of carbon source have been tested and can play an important role during microbial fermentation because they are the integral components for the production of cellular material and most of the time they are also associated with microbial growth  <cit> . much interest has been diverted towards the utilization of economically available carbon sources in order to fulfill the industrial requirements. in the current study, to improve the production of α-amylase and amyloglucosidase for starch hydrolysis and bioethanol production, seven different carbon sources were utilized . the induction pattern for both amylolytic enzymes was different in various carbon sources suggesting that these hydrolases are inducible. among all, cassava starch proved to be the most favorable inducer and contribute highest amount of enzyme units  and glucose formation  as compared to the other carbon sources tested. these results suggest that pure starch based carbon sources including sago starch, soluble starch  and cassava starch are more suitable for the production of enzyme and glucose formation as compared to the different complex biomass  whereas, no enzyme production was detected when wheat starch and rice bran were used. this is because the lingocellulosic tough plant matrix was not pretreated. the cell free filtrate  collected after fermentation showed negligible titers for cellulase, pectinase and xylanase  therefore; the starch content was not accessible for fermentation as compared to the purified starch materials. fatima and ali  <cit>  tested sixteen fungal species for the production of amyloglucosidase  using starch in fermentation medium and the best strain they identified was a. oryzae llb- <dig> . they also noticed a 30% increase in the enzyme activity when some of the process parameters were altered . very recently, puri et al.  <cit>  reported the use of rice bran: wheat bran , rice bran: paddy husk  for the production of amylase and amyloglucosidase and the maximum amylase  and amyloglucosidase  activity was achieved when rice bran was incorporated in the fermentation medium inoculated with a. oryzae. however, a. fumigatus ntcc  <dig> exhibited  <dig>  u/ml amylase activity under solid state fermentation when incubated at 35°c  for 06 days in nutrient salt solution  <cit> . in another study, detergent mediated production of glucoamylase in the presence of soluble starch is also reported using a. niger fme under shake flask system  <cit> . several other researchers have also used cassava starch and cassava pulp as alternative carbon source for bioethanol production using α-amylase and amyloglucosidase  <cit> . the compositional analysis of cassava starch used in this study is presented in table  <dig>  the type and source of starch based materials plays a crucial role for achieving maximum bioethanol yield. the starch content in variety of biomaterials will govern the cost of bioethanol production. therefore, before considering the production of bioethanol using a specific source, the nature of the starch molecule  and the method of extraction employed must be kept in consideration. however, the values of compositional analysis of starch cannot be compared with other starch sources because of the variation of the plant source and the methods used to analyze the structure or content of starch. after selection of a suitable carbon source, fermentation time for the production of amylolytic enzymes was also studied by incubating a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> for different time interval ranging from  <dig> to 07 days. it was observed that production of α-amylase and amyloglucosidase started after 02 days of incubation and both the hydrolases were continuously produced up to day  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively with a maximum titter secreted at day  <dig> . afterwards, it was also noticed that as incubation time increases, amylolytic activity as well as glucose formation decreases. this might be due to the fact, with the passage of time the nutrients become depleted and other secondary metabolites are formed which eventually alters the ph of the medium and inhibits both the growth of the fungi as well as enzyme secretion  <cit> . most of the time, secondary metabolites have a catabolic repression effect. amylase from fungal sources is normally produced after  <dig> to 07 days of incubation but in some cases, enzyme secretion can be extended up to 15 days  <cit> . prolong incubation time is one of the drawbacks of using filamentous fungi at industrial scale level which eventually increases process cost.

after fermentation, α-amylase and amyloglucosidase were partially purified from the cff. most of the time in cff some other constitutive enzymes may also be present including various types of proteases which could cause interference during liquefaction and saccharification process of cassava starch. therefore, to avoid any hindrance, starch hydrolyzing enzymes from the cff were purified using gradient precipitation in the presence of ammonium sulfate ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and among it 40% saturation level was selected. table  <dig> summarizes the purification profile of α-amylase and amyloglucosidase. fold purification of both α-amylase and amyloglucosidase increased up to  <dig>  and  <dig>  times with a specific activity of  <dig>  kumg- <dig> and  <dig> kumg- <dig>  respectively. previously, slivinski et al. <cit>  and da silva and peralta  <cit>  have also reported precipitation of amyloglucosidase using ammonium sulfate produced by a. niger and a. fumigatus, respectively. ammonium sulfate precipitation method was also used for purification of α-amylase from pencillium chrysogenum and a. niger jgi  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the enzyme kinetic analysis showed that the optimum ph, temperature, vmax and km values for α-amylase from a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> were  <dig>  , 65°c,  <dig>  ku ml- <dig> and  <dig>  mg ml- <dig>  respectively. whereas, optimum ph, temperature, vmax and km values for amyloglucosidase were  <dig>  , 60°c,  <dig>  ku ml- <dig> and  <dig>  mg ml- <dig>  respectively. the optimum ph and temperature for amyloglucosidase activity isolated from a. niger fme was  <dig>  and 45°c, respectively whereas, the km and vmax values were determined using soluble starch as substrate as 94 μg ml- <dig> and  <dig>  umg- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in another recent study, the optimum ph of amyloglucosidase was  <dig>  and the optimum temperature was 60°c along with km and vmax values of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> and  <dig> umg- <dig> <cit> . looking at the kinetic properties of the other recently studied amylolytic enzymes, it is therefore suggested that both the hydrolases from a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> could be used for industrial starch saccharification purpose. both partially purified enzymes were used for bioethanol production.

conversion of starchy materials into ethanol is an intricate process and several attempts have been made to produce bioethanol in commercially feasible quantities and to easily scale-up the methodology used. cassava starch is a complex molecule containing amylose and amylopectin and for the production of bioethanol, first the starch molecules must be hydrolyzed into more simple sugars. some pretreatment techniques including hot water and steam explosion treatment, alkaline and solvent pretreatment, acid hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation for the breakdown of complex starch molecule into simpler sugars have also been studied  <cit> . more recently, a new pre-treatment technique known as popping pre-treatment have gained attention for the hydrolysis of starchy feedstock  <cit> . however, enzymatic degradation using different hydrolases is mostly preferred because during acid hydrolysis the percent conversion of starch into reducing sugars is low as compared to the enzymatic degradation  <cit> . with the progression and advancement in enzymology, amylolytic enzymes are now preferable over conventional methods because enzymatic treatments lead towards high yield of glucose with reduced energy consumption. therefore, in the current study gelatinized cassava starch was liquefied using α-amylase and was further saccharified by means of amyloglucosidase. however, before breaking starch into simple fermentable sugars, the time required for both the processes to occur effectively was also analyzed by incubating the gelatinized starch slurry with both partially purified amylolytic enzymes for different time intervals. glucose was the main end-product which is required for production of bioethanol, therefore the concentration of glucose formation as well as percent saccharification was monitored throughout this study. gelatinized cassava starch was mixed with partially purified α-amylase  and amyloglucosidase . it was observed that as the reaction time increases, the formation of glucose  as well as percent saccharification  also increased up to  <dig>  minutes and beyond that both parameters become constant . this glucose containing mixture was further used for the production of ethanol. efficiency of enzymatic liquefaction and saccharification also depends upon optimum enzyme activity as well as the purity of amylolytic enzymes as crude enzyme takes longer time period to completely hydrolyze starch molecule into glucose as compared to the purified enzyme . this percent saccharification  could also be further augmented by either improving the purity of enzyme or by incorporating other hydrolyase  along with these amylolytic enzymes  <cit> . as reported earlier further increase in percent saccharification could also be achieved if the starch slurry was autoclaved before addition of amylolytic enzyme  <cit> . similarly, aggarwal et al. <cit>  and soni et al. <cit>  have also discussed about the role of the purity level of amylolytic enzymes during starch hydrolysis. in the same way, shanavas et al. <cit>  have also previously analyzed the effect of reaction time on saccharification of cassava starch and have obtained maximum percent saccharification after  <dig>  minutes of incubation followed by slight increase when using commercially available starch hydrolyzing enzymes. on the contrary, aggarwal et al. <cit>  reported maximum percent saccharification using crude amylolytic enzymes after 24 hours of incubation time. very recently, gohel et al.  <cit>  used simultaneous saccharification and solid state fermentation for the production of ethanol using indian sorghum feedstock and also incorporated acid fungal protease instead of urea for better ethanol yield.

a large number of microbes including bacteria, yeast and fungi are capable of producing ethanol from fermented sugars  <cit> . among them s. cerevisiae is widely used for production of bioethanol because it is not only able to produce high amount of ethanol but it can also tolerate and survive higher concentrations of ethanol formed in the medium  <cit> . however, most of the yeast strains are not capable to directly ferment complex starchy materials  <cit> . therefore, in the current study s. cerevisiae was used for the production of ethanol from glucose which was earlier formed by the action of fungal amylolytic enzymes. table  <dig> summarizes the results of bioethanol production after  <dig> and 48 hours of yeast fermentation and it was noticed that the maximum percent yield of bioethanol  was obtained after 48 hours. after 48 hours, the fermented medium was distilled and the percent yield became  <dig> %. the concentration and purity of the distilled ethanol was also analyzed using gas chromatography .

several techniques including direct fermentation, simultaneous saccharification, simultaneous non-thermal saccharification, ultrasound assisted treatment and solid-state fermentation have been studied previously using different starchy materials and microbial sources for the production of bioethanol  <cit> . along with this ethanol has also been produced by repeated batch culture through immobilization of s. cerevisiae and s. pastorianus ifo <dig> on calcium alginate and porous cellulose carriers, respectively  <cit> . nikolic et al.  <cit>  used ultrasound-assisted treatment for direct conversion of corn meal into bioethanol but the cost related to this method in amount of energy consumption is very high. beside this, the pretreatment of multiple biomass or starch flour will also add extra budget that will eventually affect the feasibility of the bioethanol. the attempt made in the current study by consuming commercially available cheap cassava starch along with saccharification by synergistic effect of fungal amylolytic enzymes had revealed that this two-step based method can be used to achieve higher yields of bioethanol. further, the process cost can also be reduced by using other inexpensive starchy materials or by establishing pilot programs that will scrutinize the actual feasibility and sustainability of the overall process developed.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, an improved and effective enzymatic saccharification of inexpensive cassava starch using amylolytic enzymes from a. fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> was developed. the glucose obtained after enzymatic degradation was utilized for the bioethanol production using s. cerevisiae. dual systematic enzyme conversion has advantages in terms of reduced energy consumption as well as increased production of fermentable sugar to achieve maximum bioethanol yield as compared to other processes. in addition, the process developed is more rapid as compared to the previously conducted studies using liquefaction and saccharification of cassava starch.
