BACKGROUND
desert hedgehog  is a member of the hedgehog gene family which act as secreted intercellular signal transducers  <cit> . hedgehog was first identified as a segment polarity gene in drosophila and has since been identified as a key regulator of pattern formation in embryonic and adult development in many vertebrate and invertebrate species. in addition, the hedgehog gene has undergone duplications in both invertebrates and vertebrates to produce a number of orthologues  <cit> . mammals have three hedgehog orthologues, sonic , indian , and desert  hedgehog  <cit> . all three share a striking homology with the drosophila orthologue  <cit> . each mammalian orthologue has a unique, largely non-overlapping expression pattern, except in the gut where ihh and shh are co-expressed, and in the adult ovaries where ihh and dhh are co-expressed  <cit> . shh has an essential role in early fetal development, and is required for correct formation of the limbs, phallus, somites and neural tube  <cit> . ihh has a more restricted developmental role, and is essential for chondrocyte development  <cit> . dhh is essential for the maintenance of the male germ line and spermatogenesis  <cit> . dhh is also expressed in schwann cells, and appears to play a role in nerve sheath formation  <cit> .

hedgehog actions are mediated at the cell surface by a multi-component receptor complex comprising the patched  receptors and smoothened  protein  <cit> . both proteins have orthologues in drosophila that are also involved in hedgehog signal transduction and pattern formation. initially, all three hedgehog protein functions were thought to be mediated through the ptch <dig> receptor in mammals. however, a second orthologue was identified, ptch <dig>  which shares significant sequence homology with ptch <dig>  ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> both bind all hedgehog family members with similar affinities, and each forms a complex with smo. however, the expression patterns of ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> do not entirely overlap, suggesting some degree of functional specialization  <cit> . while ptch <dig> is widely expressed throughout the mouse embryo, ptch <dig> is most predominant in the skin and in testis  <cit> .

in the mouse, dhh is expressed in the presumptive testis from e <dig>  through to adult stages. dhh was initially thought to be specifically expressed in the testis in the pre-sertoli cells and so it was suggested it may be directly modulated by sry  <cit>  or its downstream partner sox <dig>  <cit> . dhh-null male mice are sex reversed  <cit> , their gonads are small and devoid of sperm and the mice develop as phenotypic females due to a lack of male steroid hormone production  <cit> . leydig cell numbers are dramatically decreased in the dhh null gonad, but are not entirely absent  <cit> . dhh appears to be an important regulator of leydig cell development since its over-expression in the somatic cells can induce leydig cell development  <cit> . in contrast to the dhh-null males, female mice lacking the dhh gene develop normally and are fertile  <cit> . while dhh does not appear to be important for ovarian development, dhh mrna has been detected in the granulosa cells of preantral and antral follicles suggesting it can be activated in an sry-independent manner  <cit> . in humans, mutations in dhh cause a range of phenotypes in  <dig>  xy male patients from mild  <cit>  to complete gonadal dysgenesis, including bilateral streak gonads, normally developed müllerian ducts, and female external genitalia  <cit> .

the majority of genes involved in testicular differentiation are highly conserved among the vertebrates  <cit> . however, no dhh orthologue has been identified in birds, although a paralogue  is present in the zebrafish , anole lizard  and african clawed frog  genomes http://www.ensembl.org. here we describe high conservation of dhh, ptch <dig> and  <dig> in the genome of a marsupial, the tammar wallaby . marsupials, have been evolving independently of eutherian mammals for 130-  <dig> million years  <cit> . to determine when dhh evolved its role in mammalian testicular development, we examined the expression of dhh and its receptors ptch <dig> and  <dig> during marsupial gonad development.

methods
animals
tammar wallabies of kangaroo island, south australia origin were maintained in our breeding colony in open grassy enclosures. husbandry, handling and experiments were in accordance with the national health and medical research council of australia/commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization/australian research council  guidelines and approved by the university of melbourne animal experimentation ethics committees.

pregnancies were initiated by removal of the pouch young  from animals carrying a blastocyst in embryonic diapause  <cit> . the day of rpy is designated day  <dig> of pregnancy and births occur 26- <dig> days later  <cit> . fetuses were removed from the uterus, dissected and tissues snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for mrna expression analyses or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°c for protein localization. the sex of the fetus or pouch young was determined by the presence of scrotal bulges in males or mammary primordia in females  <cit>  or by pcr for sry  <cit> . the developing gonadal ridge first becomes apparent around day  <dig> of gestation in the fetal tammar wallaby  <cit> . we examined gonads from day  <dig> of gestation through to adulthood in both males and females.

cloning of a tammar wallaby dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch2
a full length dhh cdna clone was isolated from a lambda-zap ii cdna library . the cdna library was constructed by clontech laboratories. libraries were plated to a density of  <dig>   <dig> plaque-forming units per  <dig> ×  <dig> cm nunc plate. the library was screened with a full-length mouse dhh cdna probe at 60°c in church's buffer  <cit> .

ptch <dig> and  <dig> sequences were partially isolated from the tammar wallaby genome trace-archives http://www.ensembl.org. pcr and race was used to fully characterise the open reading frame  of each receptor. pcr fragments were cloned into p-gem-t-easy plasmid  and sequenced to verify. race was performed according to manufacturers instructions .

phylogenetic analyses
complete cdna sequences for annotated, full-length hedgehog and patched family members were obtained from the ensembl database  and aligned using muscle http://www.ebi.ac.uk. trees with fewer than  <dig> nodes were constructed by aligning sequences using muscle and assembling tree with mr.bayes  <dig> . <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> generations, sampled every  <dig> with burnin set to the first  <dig>  larger trees were aligned with tcoffee http://www.ebi.ac.uk and assembled with mr.bayes  <dig> . <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> generations, sampled every  <dig> with burnin set to the first  <dig>  all trees were viewed and ordered in figtree  <dig> . <dig> 

rna extraction
total rna was extracted from frozen tissues using the genelute total rna mini kit . rna was dnase treated using the dnafree reagent . dna free rna was reverse transcribed using a dt primer and the superscript iii kit according to manufacturers instructions . all rt-pcr derived products were sequence verified as described above.

immunohistochemistry
tissues were fixed in 4% pfa overnight and embedded in paraffin wax according to standard methods. deparaffinised tissue sections  were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for  <dig> min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. antigen retrieval was achieved by placing slides in boiling  <dig>  m tris hcl ph  <dig>  for  <dig> min. primary antibodies were applied to sections as follows; dhh , 1: <dig>  ptch <dig>  1: <dig> and ptch <dig>  1: <dig>  the dhh antibody was verified by western blot to detect a single protein of  <dig> kda . furthermore, dhh is the primary hedgehog ligand expressed in the marsupial gonad  <cit> . while the ptch <dig> and  <dig> antibodies were not validated by western blot in the tammar wallaby, the ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> antibodies were raised against epitopes that share  <dig> and 100% homology respectively with the analogous tammar target proteins, but that show no cross reactivity. in addition, no other homologous sequences exist within the tammar genome with which the antibody could non-specifically cross react  <cit> . primary antibodies were incubated at 4°c overnight. depending on the primary antibody, the secondary antibody was either an anti-goat igg raised in rabbit  or an anti-rabbit igg raised in goat , both conjugated to biotin and used at a 1: <dig> dilution. signal was amplified using the abc kit  and visualised using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole   and sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. immunohistochemistry was performed on at least  <dig> independent samples at each stage. negative controls were performed as above with the primary antibody omitted.

fluorescence in situ hybridisation mapping
chromosomes were prepared from peripheral blood according to standard methods  <cit> . chromosome in situ suppression  hybridisation of the genomic lambda clones was performed, with minor modifications  <cit> . the largest dhh cdna clone was labelled with digoxigenin using nick translation. the labelled probe was incubated with  <dig> ng of tammar wallaby cot <dig> dna before hybridisation to tammar-fixed metaphase chromosome spreads for  <dig> h at 37°c. slides were washed in  <dig>  × ssc at 60°c and hybridisation detected with anti-dig-mouse antibody , followed by tetramethyl rhodamine iso-thiocyanate  conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody . following hybridisation, the slides were counterstained with dapi  to visualise the chromosomes.

expression analyses
rt-pcr was carried out according to standard methods using oligo dt primed cdna  and  <dig> pcr cycles. no-template negative controls were included in each round, and in each case showed no amplification . a single sample was used for each amplification.

quantitative pcr was similarly performed on oligo dt primed, reverse transcribed mrna was prepared as outlined above. quantitative pcr was carried out using the iq sybr green master mix  in  <dig> ul reactions using primers for tammar dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig>  and normalised to β-actin as previously described  <cit> . each pcr was performed on a single sample in triplicate  and only those samples with a standard deviation of less than  <dig> cycle considered for analyses. relative changes in gene expression were analysed using the methods described by pfaffl  <cit> . the variance in cycle threshold  was normalised across samples  and inversely plotted as a percentage of the earliest Δct.

RESULTS
isolation of the tammar wallaby dhh cdna
eight independent cdna clones of dhh were isolated from the tammar wallaby pouch-young cdna library. the two cdna clones containing the longest 5' and 3' utrs and overlapping with each other in the coding region were sequenced. the combined length of the two dhh clones was  <dig>  kb with a predicted open reading frame of  <dig>   <dig> bp. this encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kd. there were several common features between the predicted tammar dhh protein and that of mouse  <cit> . a short stretch of n-terminal residues  were highly hydrophobic and presumed to function as a signalling peptide. there was a conserved  <dig> amino acid stretch, cgpgrg, after the signal peptide used to generate the secreted form of dhh. drosophila hedgehog protein and vertebrate shh, and dhh proteins are processed into two smaller secreted peptides by an auto-proteolytic process, both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . the catalytic site, gcf, was conserved in the tammar dhh protein, suggesting a similar auto-proteolytic mechanism may also occur to produce a  <dig>  kd n-terminal peptide  and a  <dig>  kd c-terminal peptide . furthermore, the tammar and mouse dhh proteins share 96% identity in the n-terminal peptide and  <dig> % in the c-terminal peptide, implying that both regions have been highly conserved during evolution .

ptch <dig> and  <dig> were partially isolated from the tammar wallaby genome http://www.ensembl.org. pcr and race was used to fill in missing portions to complete the open reading frame for each gene. ptch <dig> was seven amino acids longer than its human orthologue and shares 83% sequence homology and 96% amino acid similarity. conservation was particularly high  in the transmembrane domains and there was complete conservation of the putative glycosylation sites .

ptch <dig> was more divergent, but still shared 79% sequence identity and 89% amino acid similarity with eutherian orthologues. the tammar ptch <dig> predicted protein was  <dig> amino acids shorter at the n-terminus compared to eutherian ptch <dig>  in addition we identified a  <dig> amino acid contiguous insertion immediately downstream of the 12th  transmembrane domain located at the c-terminus, which was present in cdna isoforms isolated from both the day  <dig> and day  <dig> post partum  testis . a relaxed blast search of the non-redundant protein and nucleotide database with this  <dig> amino acid  sequence failed to return any homology in any described species, except for hits to human and opossum ptch <dig> in the same location, downstream of the terminal transmembrane domain. the insertion shows 70% nucleotide identity and 79% amino acid similarity with human. interestingly, one of the base changes in the human sequence  produced a premature stop codon . as a result, there were no human protein hits that included this region, only nucleotide homology, and no known ests mapping to the nucleotide stretch. the sequence maps to reads in the unannotated genome archives of the opossum with 81% nucleotide identity and 77% amino acid similarity. the sequence shows low homology  to mouse and cow gdna in the same region. additional exon aside, the c-terminus was the most variable region both within and between eutherians and marsupials . as with ptch <dig>  the transmembrane domains and glycosylation sites were all extremely conserved with 90-100% sequence identity within these regions. additionally, multiple truncated splice variants of ptch <dig> showing developmentally-regulated expression were identified during the subcloning process .

phylogenetic relationships of dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> to eutherian and non-mammalian vertebrates
a phylogenetic analysis of dhh sequences grouped them into four main clusters, one for primates, another elephant, mouse, and hyrax, a third for pig, dog, and dolphin; tammar was an outlier . these groupings are largely consistent with the accepted mammalian phylogenetic tree and all eutherian clusters show equal divergence.

dhh orthologues are absent from the bird genome, but are annotated in other non-mammalian vertebrates including the anole lizard, african clawed frog, zebrafish, medaka, stickleback and puffer fish. to determine the evolutionary relationship of these orthologues to mammalian dhh we constructed a phylogenetic tree  using complete sequences for shh, ihh and dhh for all vertebrate species, as well as for the zebrafish specific echidna  and tiggywinkle  hedgehog genes  <cit> . our analyses show that the non-mammalian dhh orthologues do not cluster with the dhh of mammals, but instead form a highly divergent out-group, suggesting that these paralogues had an independent evolutionary origin  and are hereafter referred to as the fishy hedgehogs .

the ptch analyses were less inclusive as only a few species had complete open reading frame sequences available. however, the ptch <dig> phylogenetic tree mimicked standard mammalian groupings, with the tammar clustering with other mammals, and zebrafish as the outlier . phylogenetic analysis of ptch <dig> grouped tammar ptch <dig> with that of other mammals, but as the most divergent lineage. ptch <dig> was more divergent between species than dhh or ptch <dig> .

all full-length proteins used for phylogenetic analyses were obtained from ensembl and are listed in additional file  <dig> 

genomic localisation of the tammar wallaby dhh cdna
a single localization signal was observed for tammar wallaby dhh on chromosome 1q in approximately 50% of spreads examined, with no other consistent localization signals seen .

expression of dhh in the tammar wallaby
dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> expression was examined in the gonads throughout fetal and pouch young development using an rt-pcr assay. in contrast to the mouse, dhh was expressed in the gonads of both male and female fetuses and pouch young. dhh was expressed from the first appearance of the genital ridge until after testicular and ovarian differentiation had occurred and persisted in the adult . in addition, both ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> were expressed throughout gonadal development, through to adulthood. although not quantitative, ptch <dig> expression appeared to be expressed at a lower level than ptch <dig>  in the testis, both ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> were present from  <dig> day after birth, around the time of initiation of cord formation in the tammar .

a limited quantitative real-time pcr profile confirmed the presence of dhh at all stages of gonad development in both testes and ovaries . dhh mrna levels were similar in the developing male and female gonads at all stages examined, but in adult gonads ovarian expression was low . ptch <dig> expression was consistent throughout gonadal development in males and females, with lowest levels seen in the adult ovary . in contrast, ptch <dig> levels remained constant in the gonad of both males and females at all stages examined including in the adult . all three genes were also expressed in the prostate and adrenal albeit at lower levels than in the developing gonads.

dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> protein distribution during gonadogenesis
dhh was widely distributed throughout the bipotential gonad, ptch <dig> and  <dig> staining was present but very weak . by day  <dig> pp the cords were beginning to form in the testis, and dhh stained pre-sertoli cells that were coalescing into cord- like structures . ptch <dig> protein stained weakly throughout the gonad while ptch <dig> appeared more prominent and was localized outside the forming cords. at day  <dig> pp cords were fully formed in the developing testis. dhh protein was present throughout the gonad and was strongly detected in some sertoli cells and in the peritubular myoid cells and at the basement membrane. ptch <dig> was diffuse throughout the gonad but was mainly localised in the sertoli cells and absent from the interstitium. conversely, ptch <dig> staining was more intense and concentrated in leydig cells in the interstitium . in the adult testis, dhh was present at low levels in all cell types, but strong staining was seen in round spermatids from the post pachytene primary spermatocyte stage, through to the mature sperm. ptch <dig> was present at high levels in the leydig cells and showed a punctate distribution reminiscent of membrane bound protein recycling  <cit> . ptch <dig> distribution also became highly restricted and localised strongly in the sertoli cells .

the ovary becomes clearly differentiated around day  <dig> pp in the tammar  <cit> . at day  <dig> pp dhh staining was diffuse throughout the gonad along with ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> . however, all three proteins were noticeably absent from the germ cells. by day  <dig> pp dhh was present in low levels across the ovary, but strongly localised within the germ cells that have coalesced into nests. ptch <dig> was also expressed in the germ cells at this stage, while ptch <dig> staining was weak and primarily in the interstitial tissue . in the adult ovary, dhh was present but weak throughout the gonad. ptch <dig> staining was only weakly detected in the granulosa cells of antral follicles, but increased in the cumulus cells of mature follicles. staining was also seen in the steroidogenic theca cells. ptch <dig> showed a similar distribution to ptch <dig> but was abundant in the granulosa, cumulus and theca cells . dhh, ptch <dig>  and ptch <dig> were also detected in the corpus luteum .

discussion
we have shown that dhh is a highly conserved mammal specific hedgehog paralogue with conserved expression during mammalian gonadogenesis. dhh and its receptors ptch <dig> and  <dig> are highly conserved at the protein level and are expressed in an analogous pattern to that seen in the mouse gonad. however, dhh was expressed in the developing marsupial ovary in contrast to the mouse, in which it is testis-specific during development.

phylogenetic analysis of the hedgehog gene family across vertebrates shows that non-mammalian dhh genes in fish form a distinct subgroup, distantly related to mammalian dhh genes, indicating they have had an independent evolutionary origin. we have re-named this sub-group fishy hedgehog  to emphasise their distinction from the dhh genes. this suggests that the evolution of mammalian dhh is a recent event  making it quite unique among the gonadal differentiation genes, all of which have orthologues in the non-mammalian vertebrates with the notable exception of the sex determination switch gene sry, which is also mammal specific  <cit> . despite its recent origin, dhh was extremely highly conserved between marsupials and eutherians, suggesting it quickly adopted an essential function in mammalian reproduction.

the hedgehog receptors ptch <dig> and  <dig> were highly conserved between marsupials, eutherians and non-mammalian vertebrates. marsupial ptch <dig> was the most divergent  but still shared 89% amino acid similarity with eutherian orthologues. the tammar ptch <dig> c-terminus contained a  <dig> amino acid additional exon not found in eutherian ptch <dig> proteins. interestingly, significant homology to the additional tammar exon was identified in the human ptch <dig> genomic sequence, in intron  <dig>  and shared 70% identity at the nucleotide level and 79% amino acid similarity with the tammar additional exon . the level of conservation of this exon between marsupials and humans was much higher than that of non-functional intronic dna, suggesting functional conservation of the sequence. translation of the human sequence revealed a premature stop codon at amino acid  <dig>  so its inclusion in the transcript would lead to a ptch <dig> receptor with a severely truncated intracellular signalling domain . such an isoform, lacking exon  <dig>  identical to the one predicted from the inclusion of the human putative exon 21a, has been previously identified  <cit> . the human Δ- <dig> ptch <dig> isoform is the only one capable of acting as a strong inhibitor of shh induction, similar in function to ptch <dig>  <cit> . it appears that the ability to produce such an isoform was derived from a stochastic nonsense mutation in the original exon 21a leading to a truncated protein. the tammar does not have a premature stop  and so this tammar ptch <dig> isoform does not share redundancy with ptch <dig> function. the degree of conservation of this region in humans suggests that it has only recently become non-functional in primate evolution. it is intriguing then, that this sequence could not be identified in any other mammalian ptch <dig> loci, but only in the tammar, opossum, and human. these findings suggest that the exon was present in the ancestral ptch <dig> gene and has been independently lost in different eutherian lineages . we also identified several ptch <dig> isoforms that appear to be dynamically regulated at specific developmental time points. this is also consistent with findings in humans that identified ptch <dig> isoforms lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that ptch <dig> has divergent species-specific roles in development, while ptch <dig> is likely to maintain a highly conserved function in hedgehog signal transduction. furthermore, it suggests that the human ptch <dig> Δ- <dig> isoform may have evolved to compensate for a loss of ptch <dig> in tissues in which they are co-expressed.

dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> mrna and protein were present throughout gonadal development in both males and females, from early development through to adult stages. the presence of ligand and both receptor proteins throughout gonadal development is consistent with findings in mouse testis, but not ovary  <cit>  and suggests a conserved role for hedgehog signalling in mammalian gonad formation. these findings are also consistent with the observed disruption to normal gonadal patterning and significant reduction in the expression of the downstream target gene gli <dig>  in the tammar when hedgehog signalling is ablated in vitro  <cit> .

in the testis, dhh could be seen within the pre-sertoli cells of the aggregating cords. once the testes differentiated, dhh staining was concentrated in the sertoli cells, especially at the basal lamina of the cord. this protein distribution is similar to that reported in mouse  <cit>  and suggests it is critical for testicular patterning. however, there were some differences in ptch distribution from predicted mouse patterns. ptch <dig> staining was similar to that of dhh, and was distributed mainly within the seminiferous cords . this was in contrast to the interstitial expression seen for ptch <dig> in the developing mouse testis  <cit>  but similar to the expression of ptch <dig>  <cit> . conversely, ptch <dig> staining in the tammar was more reminiscent of ptch <dig> distribution in the mouse testis  <cit>  and was located throughout the gonad but concentrated in the interstitium and leydig cells. this suggests there may have been a reversal in the roles of these receptors in marsupial testicular development relative to the mouse. since detailed localisation of the ptch receptors during gonad development in other mammals and vertebrates is not available we cannot determine which profile is more typical during development.

there was discrete staining of dhh, ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> proteins in the adult testis. dhh was concentrated in the differentiating germ cells, but restricted to the post pachytene primary spermatocyte stage through to the mature sperm. there was faint ptch <dig> and ptch <dig> staining throughout the testis but the proteins were concentrated in the leydig cells and sertoli cells respectively. this is consistent with in situ results in the adult mouse testis  <cit> , suggesting a conserved role for these genes in maintaining testicular function and spermatogenesis in all therian mammals.

unlike in the mouse, in which dhh is testis-specific in early development  <cit> , dhh was expressed in the developing tammar ovary throughout development. activation of hedgehog signalling in the developing mouse ovary leads to leydig cell development  <cit> . however, early ovarian development was not affected by the presence of dhh in the tammar, despite the presence of similar mrna and protein levels of both ligand and receptors as in the developing testis. these findings show that sry is not needed for dhh activation in the developing gonad. in the juvenile ovary, dhh was abundant in the oocytes consistent with the suggested role for dhh in maintaining the germ line  <cit> . in the adult ovary, dhh was broadly co-localized with ptch <dig> and  <dig>  in follicles and the corpus luteum suggesting it may be important for normal folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis, consistent with recent findings in the mouse  <cit> . as in the testis, ptch <dig> appeared to be the predominant receptor throughout ovarian development and in the adult.

CONCLUSIONS
these data support a conserved role for hedgehog signalling in gonadal development but show that in marsupials this pathway may be significant for early patterning of the ovary as well as for the testis. these results, in conjunction with our phylogenetic analysis of hedgehog family members in all vertebrates, suggests that dhh is unique to mammals and is a conserved member of the gonadal development pathway.
