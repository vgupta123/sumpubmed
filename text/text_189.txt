BACKGROUND
fleece rot  is a bacterial dermatitis of the sheep skin and fleece caused by an overgrowth of the natural skin microflora following prolonged exposure to moisture  <cit> . fr is characterised grossly by bands of matted and often discoloured fibres along the mid-line of the animal over the neck, wither, mid-back and rump regions. its severity ranges from bacterial discoloration causing coloured bands , to extensive gummy exudates  causing bands of matted fibres  <cit> . severe fr can cause weakening of wool substantially lowering wool quality and value. in addition to direct effects on fleece quality, fr is the most important predisposing factor to blowfly body strike, a form of blowfly strike, in eastern australia. inflammation and ulceration of the skin occurs at the fr affected site attracting blowflies which deposit eggs and providing moisture for the eggs to hatch and soluble protein for the freshly hatched larvae to feed on which can lead to severe tissue damage and death in extreme cases. body strike causes significant losses annually as a result of increased chemical and labour costs and reduced production.

three host barriers have been identified that are involved in the development of resistance to blowfly strike: wool, skin and the immune system. considerable examination of the influence of fleece production traits such as colour, wax content, fibre diameter and fleece weight on susceptibility to fr has been conducted  <cit> . early morphological changes of the skin in response to wetting have been shown to include increased vascular permeability, infiltration of inflammatory cells and epidermal thickening  <cit> . the contribution of the skin barrier, bacterial communities and the sheep local skin inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune responses to fr susceptibility are less well studied and understood. divergent serological responses against pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and immune-inflammatory responses  <cit>  have been documented in fr and fly strike resistant  and susceptible  animals. ovine defence mechanisms associated with skin ige+ cells were found to play an important role in resistance to fleece rot  <cit> . in contrast, t lymphocyte-dependent immunological effector mechanisms could not be found to affect the growth or survival of blowfly larvae  <cit> . other than these studies reviewed by norris et al   <cit> , little is known about the host's response to fr and the underlying causes of susceptibility.

divergent selection has demonstrated the potential for breeding animals with enhanced resistance to fr and fly strike   <cit> ); however, conditions suitable for expression of resistance only occur sporadically in many environments. therefore, knowledge of resistance genes and identification of molecular markers for resistance would provide the means for marker assisted selection or introgression of resistance across the merino industry and lead to improved animal health and welfare, and reduced management costs and chemical residues.

the current experiment investigated the genetic drivers of resistance to fr using a three-step approach: first, a skin-focussed cdna microarray was constructed and applied to res and sus animals to identify differentially expressed  genes; second, a selected group of de genes was validated via qrt-pcr, and their coding regions surveyed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms ; finally, these snps were genotyped across three populations with different fr characteristics to ascertain their association to fr resistance.

RESULTS
analysis of phenotypic data
means  for prewet fr scores were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for armidale, trangie res and trangie sus flocks, respectively. the same set of values for the postwet fr scores were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the distributions of fr score residuals determined after adjusting for significant environment effects and polygenic components of inheritance are shown in figure  <dig>  residual fr scores were determined at the pre-wetting and post-wetting sample collection times. a third score was generated by determining the difference between the pre- and the post-wetting scores and this identified animals that showed the greatest change in fr score over the time of the experiment.

prior to the wetting trial, the armidale flock had a low infection rate and produced fr scores that followed a poisson distribution . after exposing the sheep to conditions designed to induce fr, the scores were close to a normal distribution. a high incidence of fr was confirmed in the trangie susceptible line  at the pre-wetting sampling time. this was not the case for either the armidale mapping flock  or the trangie res line . following wetting, the increased fr susceptibility is evident from the distribution of both the post-wetting and the difference data that were skewed towards higher fr scores. conversely, the trangie res line showed a distribution skewed towards lower fr scores, for both pre- and post-wetting trials .

genes differentially expressed between res and sus sheep
in total,  <dig> genes were identified as being de between the res and the sus sheep at either one of the three sampling times: immediately before , during  and after fr induction trial . the number of de genes identified at each sampling time were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  respectively . these numbers were above the expected number of significant calls  that could have been made by chance alone, from a total of  <dig>  independent tests  and at a  <dig>  significance level. the corresponding false positive rate was estimated at 80%, 44% and 48% for t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  respectively. however, due to genes interacting with each other, the number of independent tests must be less than the number of genes, meaning that these error rates specify the upper limit. table s <dig>  lists the set of  <dig> de genes along with their normalized mean expression across the six experimental conditions .

there was a smaller set of genes simultaneously de at any two times. for example, dnaja <dig> and nope were shared between t <dig> and t <dig>   <dig> de genes were common to t <dig> and t <dig> lists, and three genes between t <dig> and t <dig>  only one gene, hcfc <dig>  was de at all time points, with expression levels consistently  <dig> to 4-fold higher in res sheep.

the normalised expression of these genes determined in res and sus animals, at each of the three sampling times, is shown in the heat map of figure  <dig>  hierarchical clustering was performed in order to identify groups of genes that behaved similarly across time points. three large clusters were identified that were characterised as follows: 1) genes that fall or are naturally lower in res sheep but are higher or increase in sus sheep ; 2) genes that rise in res but fall in sus sheep ; and 3) genes that are naturally higher in res but fall in sus sheep . a number of smaller clusters existed within these three large super-clusters that may indicate functionally related sets of genes.

the analysis of gene ontology  terms on the set of  <dig> de genes resulted in the existence of four over-represented  biological processes: 1) visual behaviour ; 2) defense response to bacterium , ltf - lactotransferrin); 3) positive regulation of defense response ; and 4) epidermis development .

the analysis for enriched go terms performed on the set of de genes separate for each time point  revealed the following go terms as the most significantly enriched: at t <dig>  defence response to bacterium  with  <dig> de genes ; at t <dig>  intermediate filament  with  <dig> de genes ; at t <dig>  regulation of interferon-alpha biosynthetic process  with  <dig> de genes . the finding of keratin proteins over-represented at t <dig> and, by and large up-regulated among sus sheep , indicates that the healing process begins immediately after the skin is damaged during the fr induction.

a subset of  <dig> genes from the list of de genes was selected for validation using rt-pcr. table  <dig> shows the least-square means resulting from the anova analysis of the threshold cycles  of each gene for each of the three sampling times in both the res and sus animals. importantly, and in order to add confidence to the rt-pcr results, these animals were different to those used during the microarray analysis but were subjected to the same wetting regime.

1we fitted an overall anova model to obtain the least-square means of each gene and ten gene-specific anova models to compute the r <dig>  see materials and methods for details.

2within a row, least-square means with different superscripts are statistically different at p <  <dig>  significance level.

selection of candidate genes for fleece rot association studies
the list of  <dig> de genes, along with the information from the rt-pcr results was then used to inform selection of candidates for genetic association studies. genes were not selected on the basis of extreme de alone. instead, we developed a selection criterion that accounted for a biological function relevant to skin integrity, genes that are present in the overrepresented biological processes, genes from each of the three super-clusters and genes that were de at the t <dig> time, as these are likely to prove the basis for the initiation of a rapid and effective immune response.

in total,  <dig> snps in the genomic regions of five candidate and de genes  were targeted for association studies. for each snp, table  <dig> presents the number of individuals genotyped, minor allele frequency , and p-value  against the test for hardy-weinberg equilibrium across the three populations . while all markers showed a maf > 1%, there was a large variation in the success of the genotype assay ranging from  <dig> animals from the trangie sus line for snp fblin <dig>  to  <dig> animals from the trangie res line for snp abcex <dig>  a further snp  was found to be monomorphic for all individuals in the trangie res line.

snp association to fleece rot
the results from the snp association studies are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the armidale pre-wetting trial, the snp marker hmgin <dig> for hmgcr  gene was found to be significantly associated with fr score  explaining  <dig> % of phenotypic variance . the regression coefficient associated with this marker indicates that selecting animals with allele t  would result in a reduction of fr score by  <dig>  units. however, this same snp did not show any significant effect on fr score in post-wetting trial , nor when the fleece rot score difference between pre- and post-wetting trials was considered .

statistics are as follows: ß: regression coefficient of fleece rot score on genotype ; r2: percentage of phenotypic variation explained by the snp ; p-value: probability value associated with the test ß =  <dig>  statistics corresponding to significant associations are highlighted in bold type.

in the trangie sus line, there was no snp marker identified in either pre-wetting or post-wetting trials that had a significant effect on fr . however, significant associations for two snps  from the same gene fabp <dig>  were identified for the difference between post- and pre-wetting fr score . they explained from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.

an equally compelling result was observed in the trangie res line. in the pre-wetting trial, seven snp markers from two genes  were found to be significantly associated with fr scores, with r <dig> ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . for one of them , the significant association was maintained in the post-wetting trial, showing a decreasing effect  on fr score .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we provide the first report of gene expression in the skin of sheep before, during and after an induced fr challenge. at each time, gene expression responses were compared between res and sus populations of sheep and genes de between these phenotypic extremes were identified. a subset of candidates was chosen from the list for a genetic association study based on biological relevance or gene ontology. hence, our underlying hypothesis was that de genes could harbor snps that are associated with the fr phenotype.

microarray analysis identified  <dig> genes that were de and the majority of these genes were only significantly de at one time of the challenge regime. a single gene, host cell factor c <dig> , was de at all three stages of the trial. in every case this gene was expressed at higher levels in res sheep. little is known about the biological role of this factor, although it has been shown to form a transcriptional regulatory complex with the human herpes simplex virus protein, vp <dig>  and the transcription factor, oct- <dig>  <cit> . herpes simplex, like fr, is a disease of the skin making this an interesting parallel. the capacity to influence transcriptional regulation identifies hcfc <dig> as an attractive candidate for ongoing studies into the ability to resist fleece rot.

our initial prioritization of candidates from the de list for incorporation into the genetic association study was based on a literature review. the limited body of evidence available associates fr resistance with various immune cell populations, specifically ige and cytokines  <cit> . however, none of these factors were identified in the current study. instead, we chose to focus on genes that may contribute to the physical barrier function of skin, as this is the interface of the host and bacterial interaction. numerous keratins  and collagens  are contained in the de list but we chose to focus on fibulin  for further study. the fibulin proteins form bridges that stabilize the various components of the extracellular matrix  <cit>  and as such contribute to the integrity of the physical barrier. in the context of infectious disease, fbln <dig> was found to be expressed at higher levels in the bed of non healing ulcers compared to the bed of healing ulcers  <cit> . here, we found that snps in the fbln <dig> gene were associated with both pre-wet and post-wet fr score in the trangie res population.

lipids are also vital to barrier function as the loss of waxes, and hydrophobicity in general, is thought to be a major contributing factor to the development of fleece rot as recently reviewed  <cit> . three genes , that play roles in lipid metabolism, were identified from our de list. members of the atp-binding transport protein superfamily, including abcc <dig>  are involved in the transport of sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, cholesterol and fatty acids in epidermal lipid reorganization during keratinocyte terminal differentiation  <cit> . a snp in the abcc <dig> has been found to be the determinant of ear wax type in humans  <cit>  and, subsequently, axillary osmidrosis in humans  <cit> . in axillary osmidrosis, bacteria such as corynebacterium sp. metabolise the ear wax, producing the symptomatic strong odour  <cit> . interestingly, an earlier report from our group identified corynebacterium sp. as the most abundant bacterial genera present in the fleece of sus sheep  <cit> . however, no snps in this gene were associated with a fleece rot phenotype.

a second lipid metabolic gene resident within the de list was fatty acid desaturase  <dig>  fads <dig>  the proteins encoded by genes of the fatty acid desaturase  gene family are responsible for the production of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids from long-chain fatty acids . recently, fatty acids have been suggested to play a role in the development of inflammatory disorders and allergies  <cit> . genetic variants of the fads <dig> - fads <dig> gene cluster were also associated with the fatty acid composition of human serum and to have an impact on atopic diseases  <cit> . as was the case with abcc <dig>  no snps in fads <dig> were associated with resistance to fleece rot.

in a second approach, the genes selected for the genetic association study were members of pathways deemed to be overrepresented in the list of de genes by the gene ontology over-representation analysis. this analysis identified four biological processes whose members were over-represented among the list of de genes. two of the processes, 'defense response to bacterium' and 'positive regulation of defense response', are related to the initiation and functional performance of defense pathways. given the bacterial nature of fr, it is reassuring to see such pathways associated with variation in responsiveness. similarly, the involvement of genes associated with a third pathway 'epidermal development' is consistent with the likely damage caused to skin during fr infection and recovery of the epidermal barrier. the relationship of the fourth pathway 'visual behaviour' to fleece rot is less clear. this process is defined by the gene ontology consortium as the actions or reactions of an organism in response to a visual stimulus  <cit> .

the gene s100a <dig> was present on two of the biological processes. s100a <dig> is involved in the regulation of a cell cycle progression and differentiation and the protein is markedly over-expressed in the skin lesions of psoriatic patients, wound healing, skin cancer, inflammation and cellular stress. s100a <dig> gene is a member of the human 1q <dig> locus that is associated with atopic dermatitis  <cit> . unfortunately we were unable to identify any snp in this gene that were suitable for ongoing analysis. further efforts may resolve this issue. additionally, s100a <dig> has been reported to interact with the epidermal fatty acid binding protein  where increased expression of s100a <dig> results in increased expression of fabp <dig> and vice versa. fabp <dig> and s100a7/fabp <dig> complex bind oleic acid suggesting a role in oleic acid transport and metabolism  <cit> . oleic acid may have a role in inflammation as topical application modulates epidermal langerhans cell density. the complex could also function in lipid metabolism and transport during epidermal barrier assembly and may also modulate epidermal inflammatory response in epidermal diseases.

although fabp <dig> was not identified as de in this study, a related fatty acid binding protein, fabp <dig>  was identified. fatty acid binding proteins are hydrophobic ligand binding cytoplasmic proteins and are thought to be involved in lipid metabolism by binding and intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids. studies also imply roles of fabp family proteins in cell signaling, inhibition of cell growth and cellular differentiation. fabp <dig> has been shown to be induced in pten-null keratinocytes, suggesting a role in sebaceous gland differentiation  <cit> . importantly, snps in fabp <dig> were associated with fr score in the trangie res line pre-wet and in the sus line post-wet.

the gene 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase or hmgcr is a member of the 'visual behaviour' grouping. cholesterol synthesis is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme hmg coa reductase. cholesterol is part of the epidermal surface lipid-based barriers and their role in a number of skin conditions has long been established in that a disturbed skin barrier is an important component in the pathogenesis of contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. acute epidermal barrier disruption leads to an increase in hmgcr activity  <cit> . the activity of hmgr was reportedly increased following barrier disruption due to both an increased quantity of enzyme and an increase in activation state  <cit> . notably, snps in this gene were associated with the prewet fr score in the armidale flock.

other pathway members that would be worthy of future study include the pathogen associated molecular pattern detection receptors tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and the ripk <dig> signal transduction molecule. the presence of tlr <dig> in the de list is intriguing, as this receptor is classically associated with a response to viral infection. the elevated expression of this receptor suggests a yet to be defined viral component that may opportunistically form part of the fr infective complex. although skin is regarded as an unusual route of entry for viruses, the damaged surface caused by the bacterial component of the disease may leave sheep susceptible to later viral infection. also the involvement of hcfc <dig>  as described earlier implies that there is some circumstantial evidence that viruses that do preferentially target skin, such as herpes, may be involved.

the microarray component of this study has identified a number of genes that are likely to contribute to an ability to resist fr development. expression results were then used to inform a selection of candidates for genetic marker association with the fr phenotype. gene association studies were performed in a population of animals independent of those in which the microarray studies were performed. as a result, we have identified fbln <dig> and fabp <dig> as key factors in this response. validation of these markers in other populations could lead to vital tests for marker assisted selection that will ultimately increase the natural fleece rot resistance of sheep.
