BACKGROUND
during their growth, plants are subjected not only to abiotic stresses, such as irradiation, temperature, salinity, and drought, but also biotic stresses, such as herbivore and pathogen attacks. these stress factors can simultaneously act on the plants causing cell injury and producing secondary stresses  <cit> . as sessile organisms, plants cannot move to avoid these stresses, and thus have developed mechanisms, such as morphological adaptation, to tolerate these stresses  <cit> .

along with other stresses, heat stress can trigger the expression of certain genes that were not expressed under “normal” conditions  <cit> . heat shock proteins  accumulate when the expression of their genes is triggered by heat, as well as other stresses  <cit> . hsps are molecular chaperones that regulate the folding, localization, accumulation, and degradation of protein molecules in both plant and animal species  <cit> . the expression of hsps is controlled and regulated by specific types of transcription factors called heat shock factors , which normally exist as inactive proteins  <cit> .

plant hsps are classified into five families based on their approximate molecular weights: small hsp , hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  genes encoding hsfs and hsps have been well characterized in some model plants, such as arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes have been identified as hsf, shsp, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> family members, respectively  <cit> .

to date, various stress responses and functions of hsf and hsp members have been reported. in arabidopsis, hsfa1a, hsfa1b, and hsfa1d act as the main positive regulators of heat shock response  <cit> . arabidopsis hsfa <dig> was significantly increased under high light and heat stress or by h2o <dig> treatment. it is the key regulator in the induction of the defense system under several types of environmental stresses  <cit> . the cytosolic class i shsp in rosa chinensis, rchsp <dig> , was induced by heat, cold, salt, drought, osmotic, and oxidative stresses  <cit> . a plastid nucleoid-localized shsp  interacts with the plastid nucleoid protein ptac <dig> and is essential for chloroplast development in arabidopsis under heat stress  <cit> . hsp <dig> proteins as chaperones participate in the folding and aggregation of many proteins that are transported to organelles, such as chloroplasts and mitochondria  <cit> . arabidopsis hsp <dig> mutants showed defects in chloroplast, embryo, and seedling development and also increased cell death  <cit> . unlike other family members that are mainly expressed when the organism is subjected to environmental assaults, hsp70s play essential functions in facilitating refolding and proteolytic degradation of abnormal proteins under both normal and stress conditions  <cit> . hsp <dig> proteins belong to the caseinolytic protease  family, which forms an atp-dependent protease complex that is able to hydrolyze casein  <cit> . tomatoes that have an antisense suppression of hsp100/clpb are more heat sensitive  <cit> . moreover, lee et al.  <cit>  noted that arabidopsis mutant plants containing a chloroplast-localized hsp100/clpb-p knockout turned yellow after heat treatment. hsps were not only transcriptionally regulated by hsfs, but could also regulate the activity of hsfs through a feedback loop caused by their physical interaction. in tomato, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> regulate the hsfs’ function by directly interacting with hsfs. hsp <dig> represses the activity of hsfa <dig> and hsfb <dig>  while the dna binding activity of hsfb <dig> is stimulated by hsp <dig> in tomato  <cit> . above all, hsfs and hsps play crucial roles in plant development and various stress tolerances.

as perennial species, poplars undergo seasonal variations and various environmental stresses frequently. the completion of the populus trichocarpa genome sequencing project in  <dig> makes it an ideal genetic model for studying tree development and physiology  <cit> . to date,  <dig> populus hsfs have been reported based on the v <dig>  p. trichocarpa genome database  <cit> . in our previous study, we have reported the subcellular localization and expression, under various abiotic stresses, of  <dig> hsp <dig> genes identified from the v <dig>  p. trichocarpa genome database  <cit> . however, the other hsp families in poplar remain unclear, and little is known about the transcriptional regulatory relationships between populus hsfs and hsps. here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the gene organization and expression of populus hsfs and other hsp genes, including shsp, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  under different abiotic stresses. a complex transcriptional regulatory network between populus hsfs and hsps has been generated based on their transcription patterns in poplar.

RESULTS
identification and phylogenetic analysis of the hsf and hsp gene families in poplar
after automated database searching and a manual review,  <dig> genes were identified as members of the hsf and hsp families, including shsp, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  of p. trichocarpa. the hsf and hsp gene families, pthsf and pthsp, respectively, in poplar were relatively large compared with those in arabidopsis and rice. the numbers of identified genes in the hsf, shsp, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> families of p. trichocarpa were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . the subcellular localization predictions suggested that the pthsfs are targeted to the nucleus, while pthsps are localized to various cytosolic organelles. detailed information on the hsf and hsp genes in p. trichocarpa, including their gene ids and the characteristics of their encoded proteins, are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig> table  <dig>

to evaluate the evolutionary relationship of the hsf and hsp proteins, a phylogenetic analysis of each family was performed based on the full-length amino acid sequences from both p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis . each family could be classified into different subfamilies. the pthsf family contains three subfamilies: type a , type b , and type c . however the subfamilies in each of the pthsp families could be assigned based on the proteins’ predicted subcellular localization. the shsp family was classified into cytosolic, endoplasmic reticulum , peroxisome , chloroplast , and mitochondrial  subfamilies in p. trichocarpa. there are six groups of cytosolic shsp genes, c-i, c-ii, c-iii, c-iv, c-v, and c-vi, and two groups of mitochondrial shsp genes, mt and mt ii, in p. trichocarpa. notably, the c-i shsp group in the genome of p. trichocarpa is large, containing  <dig> genes compared with  <dig> in arabidopsis . the hsp <dig> family was divided into four subfamilies in p. trichocarpa: cytosol-localized cpn <dig> , mitochondrion-localized hsp <dig> , and chloroplast-localized cpn60-a  and cpn60-b . the hsp <dig> family contains genes encoding  <dig> cytosolic hsp70s,  <dig> binding proteins ,  <dig> plastid hsp70s ,  <dig> mitochondrial hsp70s , and  <dig> truncated hsp70s . the hsp <dig> family can be divided into three classes in p. trichocarpa, cytoplasmic , chloroplastic , and mitochondrial  .figure  <dig>

structure of hsf and hsp genes and conserved motifs of hsf and hsp proteins in poplar
to gain further insights into the structural diversity of hsf and hsp genes in p. trichocarpa, we compared the exon/intron organization in the coding sequences between individual hsf and hsp genes of p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis . most closely related members in the same hsf or hsp subfamilies shared similar intron numbers or exon length. in the pthsp <dig> family, cytosolic hsp70s have zero or one intron, er-localized bips have six introns, mitochondrion-localized mthsc70s have five introns and chloroplast-localized cphsc70s have seven introns, while truncated hsp70ts have no introns . interestingly, two cytosol-localized hsp <dig> members, ptcpn60- <dig>  and ptcpn60- <dig> , have no introns in their coding regions while the other p. trichocarpa hsp60s contain several introns  . we then compared the intron phases with respect to the codons. the intron phases were remarkably well conserved within the same subfamilies in the detected pthsf and pthsp families.

we further detected the exon/intron structure of  <dig> paralogous pairs of the pthsf and pthsp genes . although  <dig> paralogous pairs showed conserved intron numbers and gene lengths, one hsf gene pair , four shsp pairs , and one hsp <dig> pair  exhibited certain degrees of variation .

we then used the multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation   <cit>  to predict the conserved motifs shared among the related proteins within these families. in each family,  <dig> putative motifs were identified. the details of these motifs are listed in additional file 4: tables s4; additional file 5: tables s5; additional file 6: tables s6; additional file 7: tables s <dig> and additional file 8: tables s <dig>  most of the closely related members in the phylogenetic tree shared common motif compositions with each other .

chromosomal location and duplication of hsf and hsp genes in poplar
to investigate the expansion of hsf and hsp genes in p. trichocarpa, the identified pthsf and pthsp genes were plotted on the chromosomes. of  <dig> pthsf and pthsp genes,  <dig> were distributed on  <dig> chromosomes, while only four genes  localized to unassembled genomic sequence scaffolds . the distributions of hsf and hsp genes among the chromosomes appeared to be uneven in p. trichocarpa: chromosome  v, vii, xvi, xviii, and xix contain only one or two hsf and hsp genes, while relatively high densities of hsf and hsp genes were discovered on chr i, iii, vi, viii, ix, and x. in particular, hsfs and hsps were clustered on the duplicated fragments of chr viii and x in p. trichocarpa.figure  <dig>

the genome of p. trichocarpa has experienced at least two whole genome duplication  events, followed by a series of chromosomal reorganizations involving reciprocal tandem/terminal fusions and translocations  <cit> . approximately  <dig> %  hsf and hsp genes were located in the replicated region, while  <dig> genes lacked copies on the corresponding duplicated blocks. a chromosome region containing two or more genes within 200 kb can be defined as a gene cluster  <cit> . the gene clusters were distributed unevenly among hsf and hsp gene families. the shsp, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> families contain five, one, three, and one clusters, respectively . the smallest tandem duplication clusters consisted of only two genes and the largest cluster, in the hsp <dig> family, had five genes. interestingly, none of the hsf genes were represented in tandem clusters.

among the  <dig> paralogous pairs of the populus hsf and hsp families,  <dig> % gene pairs  were generated by whole genome duplication and 19%  by tandem duplication . to verify whether darwinian positive selection was involved in the hsf and hsp gene divergence after duplication, the nonsynonymous  versus synonymous  substitution rate ratios were calculated for the  <dig> paralogous pairs  <cit> . a ka/ks ratio significantly lower than  <dig>  suggests a purifying selection for both duplicates  <cit> . the summary of ka/ks for the  <dig> hsf and hsp gene paralogous pairs is shown in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

expression patterns of populus hsf and hsp genes
publicly available expressed sequence tags  provide a useful tool to survey gene expression profiles using a digital northern blot  <cit> . we conducted a preliminary expression analysis of hsf and hsp genes by counting the frequencies of ests obtained from different tissues and under various growth conditions in different populus cdna libraries . a complete search of the digital expression profiles from popgenie   <cit>  yielded  <dig> populus hsf and hsp genes in the cdna libraries. the frequencies of these ests were relatively low, and most hsf and hsp genes were represented by only one est in the cdna libraries. nevertheless, these expression profiles suggested that most of the pthsf and pthsp genes had broad expression patterns across different tissues.

we then investigated the global expression profiles of hsf and hsp genes by examining previously published microarray data in poplars. at first, affymetrix   <cit>  and a nimblegen   <cit>  microarray data from gene expression omnibus  <cit>  were used to analyze the expression patterns of hsf and hsp genes in different tissues. most populus hsf and hsp genes were detected in the two different platforms. the majority of hsf and hsp genes showed a tissue-specific expression pattern . four shsps  and two hsp60s  had high transcript levels in the differentiating xylem. two hsfs , one shsp  and one hsp <dig>  were preferentially expressed in male and female catkins, but almost all of the hsp60s had low transcript levels in catkins . during stem development,  <dig> hsfs,  <dig> shsps, and  <dig> hsp100s had high levels in the basal stem undergoing the secondary growth . in comparison, most hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> genes showed high expression levels in the upper stem  .figure  <dig>

to explore the possible roles of populus hsf and hsp genes in response to various abiotic stresses, we then analyzed their expression patterns under heat, drought, low nitrogen level, mechanical wounding, and methyl jasmonate  treatment. four hsf genes , three shsps , one hsp <dig> , and one hsp <dig>  were up-regulated under nitrogen deprivation in both genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  mechanical wounding caused the up-regulation of four populus hsfs in expanding leaves at 90 h after wounding, followed by a down-regulation at 1 week in young leaves and expanding leaves. in cell culture, the addition of mej led to the down-regulation of most shsp and hsp <dig> genes . notably, c-i shsp genes were significantly up-regulated under drought stress in the two genotypes, while the other hsf and hsp genes were not significantly changed .figure  <dig>

in a previous study, the physiological conditions of poplars at temperatures between 22°c and 42°c were divided into four states based on photosynthetic activity: the baseline , optimum , 20% inhibition of optimum , and 30% inhibition of optimum   <cit> . most shsp and hsp <dig> genes were induced when the temperature was increased to the optimum, and then continued to be induced when the photosynthesis was inhibited under heat stress, as shown using dataset gse <dig> in figure  <dig>  <cit> . because of the restrictions of the microarray probe sets, many hsf and hsp genes were not detected in gse <dig>  to gather more information on the populus hsf and hsp genes’ expression profiles under high temperatures, rna-seq data from a hybrid poplar  stem  under the heat treatments  were used to analyze the expression of populus hsf and hsp genes. in the hybrid poplar, nine hsfs, seven hsp60s, and almost all of the shsps, hsp70s, and hsp100s were induced 2 h after treated at 37°c . after a 2-h recovery period following the 37°c treatment, the expression levels of the induced hsfs, hsp60s, hsp70s, and hsp100s decreased, but not those of the shsps .figure  <dig>

confirmation of populus hsf and hsp gene expression levels by qrt-pcr
to confirm the expression profiles of populus hsf and hsp genes obtained from the microarray and rna-seq data, a qrt-pcr analysis of selected hsf and hsp genes  was performed on five different tissues  of hybrid poplar. the gene expression patterns were mostly consistent with the microarray data .figure  <dig>

we also analyzed the response of the selected hsf and hsp genes to high temperatures by qrt-pcr. a heat treatment composed a 37°c pretreatment for 3 h, a subsequent 45°c treatment for 3 h, and a 2-h recovery interval was performed   <cit> . all of the selected hsf and hsp genes were induced immediately after 30 min in the 37°c pretreatment and 45°c treatment. the expression levels of the detected genes after the 45°c treatment were relatively high compared with that of the 37°c pretreatment. after a 2-h recovery from the 37°c pretreatment, the induced transcription levels of the selected hsf, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> genes were low; however, the shsps maintained their induced transcription levels. these gene expression patterns were consistent with the rna-seq data . interestingly, in the 2-h plant recovery period after the 45°c treatment, the increased transcription levels of almost all of the selected hsf and hsp genes did not decline .figure  <dig>

populus hsfs transcriptionally regulate the expression of different sets of hsp genes
in arabidopsis, some hsfs have been shown to promote rapid hsp expression by binding to cis-acting sequences, designated as heat shock elements , in the promoter of hsps  <cit> . to explore the potential regulatory network between pthsfs and their downstream pthsps, we constructed a coexpression network between pthsfs and pthsps using wgcna  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  there are many coexpression relationships between populus hsfs and hsps, and one hsf could be coexpressed with several hsps. moreover, several pthsfs, including pthsfa <dig>  pthsfa6a, and pthsfb2a, showed high coexpression levels when bound to pthsps. to validate the possible regulatory roles of pthsfs, we transiently overexpressed pthsfs in p. trichocarpa to detect the transcriptional regulation of the downstream pthsps using qrt-pcr. two type a hsfs  and three type b hsfs  were selected for infiltration . three days after the infiltration of pthsfs, the expression levels of selected hsps  were examined to evaluate the transcriptional regulatory relationships between selected pthsf and selected pthsps .we revealed that, the expression levels of all of the detected hsps, except  <dig> vi-shsp, were induced by the overexpression of pthsfa <dig> . one shsps , two hsp60s , three hsp70s , and two hsp100s  were significantly induced by the transient overexpression of pthsfa6a, pthsfb2a, and pthsfb2b . however, only a few selected hsps were induced by the overexpression of pthsfb <dig> .figure  <dig>

discussion
duplications play major roles in the diversification of the populus hsf and hsp gene families
gene duplications represent the major mechanism for gene family expansion through either wgd or tandem duplications during evolution  <cit> . like most gene families, hsf and hsp appear to have undergone complicated evolutionary processes  <cit> . the abundance of hsf and hsp genes in p. trichocarpa may be the result of multiple gene duplication events, represented by a whole genome duplication following multiple segmental and tandem duplications  <cit> . however,  <dig> of the  <dig> hsf and hsp genes lack copies in the corresponding duplicated blocks in the genome of p. trichocarpa . this suggested that dynamic rearrangements or segmental losses may have occurred following the segmental duplication. in plants, the exon/intron diversification of gene family members has played an important role in the evolution of multiple gene families  <cit> . only  <dig> of  <dig> paralogous pairs of hsf and hsp genes exhibited certain degrees of variation in p. trichocarpa . the differences might be derived from the single intron addition or subtraction events during the structural evolution of the hsf or hsp genes.

in p. trichocarpa, ~ <dig> % of predicted genes originated from whole genome duplication and  <dig> % from tandem duplications  <cit> . our study indicates that the hsf and hsp gene families possess a higher whole genome duplication ratio  and lower tandem duplication ratio  in p. trichocarpa, which are dramatically different from the averages. this high retention rate of whole genome duplications and low retention rate of tandem duplications are also inconsistent with the previous studies on other families  <cit> . the low ka/ks ratio indicates that all gene pairs, except for two , might have evolved under the influence of purifying selection.

populus hsf and hsp genes are vital players in plant development and in response to abiotic stresses
plant hsf and hsp genes are implicated in a variety of biological processes  <cit> . the study on the populus hsf and hsp gene families showed that these genes were differentially expressed in various analyzed tissues. most hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> genes showed high expression levels in the upper stem , indicating their putative roles in the primary stem growth of populus . our qrt-pcr results showed that all selected populus hsf and hsp genes exhibited diverse expression levels in the five examined tissues , indicating that these hsf and hsp genes often participate in plant development. it is worth noting that the expression of pt <dig> i-shsp was obviously higher in stem than in leaves and roots, indicating that it may have potential roles in stem development.

hsfs, as transcriptional activators of hsps, cooperated with hsps to form a network responding to various stresses. they play a broad role in the tolerance to multiple environmental stress treatments apart from heat stress  <cit> . the response of hsfs and hsps to heat and other abiotic stresses overlaps extensively, indicating that hsfs and hsps are important in the cross-talk of multiple environmental stress response pathways  <cit> . interestingly, under drought stress, most members of the populus hsf, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> families were not regulated, while only members of the shsp family were significantly up-regulated  in the hybrid poplar . the specific response to drought stress of populus c-i shsp might be related to the member expansion of the populus c-i shsp subfamily, but the mechanisms need to be further examined. the expression of hsps could be down-regulated to their initial levels when plants recovered from high temperatures  <cit> . however, the populus shsps remained at a high expression level 2 h after the plants’ recovery from 37°c . this indicated that populus shsps play an irreplaceable role compared with other hsps  in response to heat and drought stress.

complex transcriptional regulatory network between populus hsfs and hsps
several pthsfs, including pthsfa <dig>  pthsfa6a, and pthsfb2a, showed high coexpression levels with pthsps, indicating that these pthsfs might be the key regulators among the numerous pthsfs. nishizawa et al.  <cit>  showed that arabidopsis hsfa <dig> is a key regulator in the induction of the defense system under several types of environmental stresses. in our study, the overexpression of pthsfa <dig> induced the expression of  <dig> of  <dig> hsps , indicating that pthsfa <dig> is also an activator of the downstream hsps. the expression of pthsfa <dig> was induced under nitrogen deprivation, drought, and heat stresses , implying that pthsfa <dig> is a key regulator under various stresses in poplars. a set of pthsps could be simultaneously induced by the transient overexpression of pthsfa6a, pthsfb2a, or pthsfb2b, indicating that these hsps were generally regulated by the three hsfs . recently, ikeda et al.  <cit>  reported that hsfb <dig> and hspb2b suppress the general heat shock response under non-heat-stress conditions and in the attenuating period. however, hsfb <dig> and hsfb2b appear to be necessary for the expression of heat stress-inducible hsps under heat stress conditions, which is necessary for acquired thermotolerance. in this study, most detected hsps could not be activated by the overexpression of pthsfb <dig> , while they could be activated by overexpressing pthsfb2a or pthsfb2b . these results indicated that pthsfb <dig> is not a direct activator of these hsps. under heat stress, pthsfb <dig> was also induced dramatically, indicating that although pthsfb <dig> could not regulate the downstream hsps directly, it might be involved in the heat stress response in some indirect manner. tomato  hsfb proteins may be coactivators of hsfas  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the heat stress response is finely regulated by activation and repression activities of hsfs  <cit> . the expression of a particular populus hsfs can induce the expression of a different set of hsps, suggesting a complex transcriptional regulatory network between populus hsfs and hsps. additionally, the hsps might also be regulated by both the activation and the repression mechanisms during the heat stress response in populus. however, the precise regulatory mechanisms among hsfs and hsps of woody plants during development and stress responses require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> members of populus hsf and hsp  gene families were identified. a comprehensive analysis of these genes, including phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, expression profiling and heat stress responses, was performed. in the phylogenetic tree, the majority of subfamilies contained members from both populus and arabidopsis, which suggested that the functions of most of hsfs and hsps were conserved during evolution. in addition, a gene duplication analysis revealed that the class i cytosolic shsp subfamily had expanded more than that of arabidopsis, showing both the conservation and divergence of gene families during the evolution. an extensive expression analysis indicated that populus hsf and hsp genes may play various conserved roles in different biological processes in plants. moreover, the coexpression network and transient overexpression of pthsfs imply that there is a complex transcriptional regulatory network between populus hsfs and hsps. the present study established a solid foundation for functional research on the populus hsf and hsp gene families and has improved our understanding of the functions of hsf and hsp genes in woody plants.
