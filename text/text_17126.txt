BACKGROUND
all domains of life possess the ability to recode select uga codons from a translation termination signal to a selenocysteine  codon. the translation products of successful sec incorporation are termed selenoproteins. in eukaryotes the recognition of uga as a sec codon by the protein synthetic machinery requires a cis-acting sec insertion sequence  element in the 3' untranslated regions  of selenoprotein mrnas. eukaryotic secis elements are stable stem-loop structures that are comprised of two helices separated by a kink-turn containing a conserved ga quartet  and an apical aar motif that is present either as a terminal loop  or a terminal bulge  . the trans-acting factors known to be required for sec incorporation are secis binding protein  <dig> , sec-trnasec, and the sec specific translation elongation factor, eefsec. sbp <dig> is the most studied of the known trans-acting eukaryotic sec incorporation factors. structure/function studies of rat sbp <dig> have delineated three domains: a putative regulatory domain comprising the n-terminal half of the protein , a sec incorporation domain  and an rna binding domain   <cit> . the sbp <dig> rbd contains an l7ae motif that binds the kink-turn structure found in secis rna  <cit> . while the rbd is capable of interacting with secis elements alone, its affinity is greatly enhanced by the sid. an sbp2/secis complex recruits eefsec and a model was proposed that in the sbp2/secis/eefsec complex the sid is conformationally competent to prime the ribosome for sec incorporation  <cit> .

previous studies have noted the existence of an apparent sbp <dig> paralogue, termed kiaa <dig> in sequence databases and referred to in the literature as sbp2-like protein  <cit> . current ncbi annotations for kiaa <dig> have adopted the nomenclature secisbp2l, which we abbreviate here as sbp2l. sbp2l has an l7ae rna binding motif and a domain with clear sequence homology to the sid. despite the similarity to sbp <dig>  the c-terminal fragment of human sbp2l  that is analogous to the fully functional c-terminal fragment of sbp <dig>  was not competent for sec incorporation in vitro and displayed only minimal secis binding  <cit> .

the evolutionary histories of selenoprotein families have been well documented, but to date sbp <dig> phylogeny has only been analyzed in insects  <cit> . as such we sought to gather more evolutionary insight into sec incorporation by undertaking a phylogenetic analysis of sbp <dig> as well as a study of its relationship to sbp2l. based on genome analysis, we speculate that mammalian sbp2l may play a role in selenoprotein expression but we also show that an sbp2l/sbp <dig> chimeric protein is unable to promote sec incorporation in vitro. additionally, we trace the lineage of the sbp2/sbp2l rna binding domain to archaeal ribosomal protein l <dig> 

RESULTS
sbp2l and sbp <dig> diverged during vertebrate evolution
the occurrence of sbp <dig> and sbp2l among eukaryotes can be divided into three major categories. figure  <dig> provides a representation of sbp2/sbp2l protein topology as a global sequence alignment that includes examples of sbp <dig> and its homologues from a broad sampling of species that are known to express selenoproteins. the first category is found in most vertebrates , which possess a version of sbp <dig> that contains a ~ <dig> amino acid n-terminal extension upstream of two domains known to be required for sec incorporation: the sec incorporation domain  and the secis rna binding domain . in addition to sbp <dig>  vertebrates also possess the aforementioned sbp2-like protein, sbp2l , which also contains an n-terminal extension that is only partially related to that found in sbp <dig>  the second category includes most protostomes as well as unicellular green algae and slime molds , which possess a version of sbp <dig> that lacks the n-terminal extension found in mammals. lastly, the third category consists of invertebrate deuterostomes , which possess only sbp2l. while all of the organisms studied for this report contain sequences related to the sid and rbd, the n-terminal portion of sbp2/sbp2l is highly variable as exemplified by the versions of sbp <dig> found in frog , fish , black legged tick  and the placazoan, trichoplax adhaerens.

in order to determine if the core conserved regions of sbp <dig> and sbp2l are phylogenetically distinguishable, we performed a global sequence alignment of the c-terminal portions of both proteins. we obtained full length sequences either from the ncbi refseq database or genomic sequence from a broad taxonomic sampling ranging from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals. sequences derived from genomic data were compiled by gene prediction using fgenesh  <cit>  and/or genomescan  <cit> . only sequences that could be validated with expressed sequence tag  data were used. a global sequence alignment containing the entirety of all  <dig> sequences was generated using the muscle algorithm. for the purposes of phylogenetic analysis, non-conserved sequences were eliminated using gblocks leaving only the highly conserved regions in the sid  and rbd . figure  <dig> shows a phylogenetic tree based on maximum likelihood using the whelan & goldman substitution model in phyml . the resulting tree illustrates the segregation of vertebrate sbp <dig> and sbp2l into separate sub-clades restricting the occurrence of sbp2l to all deuterostomes, the mollusk , and an annelid worm . in addition, figure  <dig> shows that sbp2l from the invertebrate deuterostomes , a mollusk l. gigantia, and the annelid worm c. sp.i are in a separate clade from that of vertebrates. despite this distinction we maintain that the sbps in invertebrate deuterostomes, l. gigantia and c. sp.i are sbp2l due to the presence of conserved motifs found in vertebrate sbp2l but not sbp <dig> . since the only form of a secis binding protein in these organisms , which are known to possess selenoprotein genes, is sbp2l, it is highly probable that sbp2l is carrying out the functions of sbp <dig> in these cases. these results indicate that even when only the highly conserved sid and rbd regions are considered, sbp <dig> and sbp2l are phylogenetically distinct.

in order to examine the specific features that discriminate between sbp <dig> and sbp2l within the conserved sid and rbd, we examined an expanded multiple sequence alignment that includes the regions used to generate the tree in figure  <dig>  within these highly conserved regions, there are individual residues that are found predominantly in either sbp2l or sbp <dig> . these include g <dig>  q <dig> and s <dig>  in the sid and k <dig>  l <dig>  n <dig> and q <dig> in the rbd. considering the proximity of these residues to those known to be required for sec incorporation , ribosome binding  and secis binding  in sbp <dig>  <cit> , it is likely that some of these residues may be required for sequence specific rna binding in the case of the rbd and specific integration of an rbd-dependent signal  in the case of the sid. the alignment shown in figure  <dig> also serves to highlight two sequence motifs that are conserved among deuterostomes but also in a mosaic of protostomes and unicellular eukaryotes . conserved motifs are designated as the human sbp <dig> or sbp2l sequence corresponding to the four most highly conserved residues in the motif with numbers indicating the full range of conserved sequence. if a motif is found in both sbp <dig> and sbp2l, the sbp <dig> numbering is used. the qldl449- <dig> motif is found in the cnidarian nematostella vectensis but not in the protostome drosophila melanogaster. on the other hand it is found in the mosquito anopheles gambiae but not in dictyostelium discoideum. in contrast, frdy629- <dig> is found in all protostomes surveyed, but among unicellular eukaryotes and other metazoans representing ancient lineages it is only present in d. discoideum, monosiga brevicollis, emiliania huxleyi and t. adhaerens. these results suggest that both of these motifs were present in the last common ancestor of sec-utilizing eukaryotes but that they were lost during the evolution of select lineages, likely due to specific constraints  at the level of the secis element or ribosome.

biochemical characterization of sbp2l has been limited, but early tests showed that the c-terminal portion of the protein, which is ~45% identical to the fully functional c-terminal sbp <dig> counterpart in humans, was unable to support sec incorporation in vitro. this correlated with the fact that sbp2l only weakly bound the gpx <dig> secis that was used in this assay  <cit> . these preliminary biochemical analyses, together with the fact that sbp2l is the only form of sbp in invertebrate deuterostomes  as well as the fact that it is not found in organisms that do not express selenoproteins , suggest that sbp2l is involved in selenoprotein synthesis. to gain further insight into the potential function for sbp2l and the evolutionary origins of secis binding proteins, we first delineated the major features that distinguish sbp2l from sbp <dig>  sbp2l is consistently larger in size than sbp <dig> as the average predicted molecular weight of chicken, rat, human, dog, and horse sbp2l is  <dig> kda while that of sbp <dig> from the same species is  <dig> kda. in terms of sequence similarity, several important differences are notable. figure  <dig> illustrates a global sequence alignment containing vertebrate sbp <dig>  sbp2l from all of the  <dig> species that we have identified as possessing complete sbp2l sequence, and unique variants of sbp <dig> from i. scapularis and t. adhaerens. the method used for identifying sbp <dig> and sbp2l sequences as well as the complete amino acid sequences and accession numbers used for this study are found in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. significant sequence similarity between sbp <dig> and sbp2l is limited to the regions comprising the sid and rbd. the n-terminal portions are much more divergent with the exception of two small motifs present at the n-terminus of both sbp2l and sbp2: lsad15- <dig> and pfvq44- <dig>  the former of which has been previously noted  <cit> . these motifs are separated by degenerate sequence of variable length, generally 29- <dig> residues in sbp2l and  <dig> residues in sbp <dig>  a detailed sequence alignment of this region is shown in figure 4b. interestingly, we found that an arthropod  and the placozoan, t. adhaerens  also contain an n-terminal lsad15- <dig> but not the pfvq44- <dig> motif, thus representing exceptions to the apparent restriction of the lsad15- <dig> motif to deuterostomes. it is also noteworthy that sbp <dig> from frog  and fish  lacks both of these motifs yet they are present in their respective versions of sbp2l. since we have identified both of these motifs in lizard  sbp <dig>  we speculate that the lsad15- <dig> and pfvq44- <dig> motifs were lost in the lineages giving rise to fish and amphibians. in addition, papp et al  <cit>  recently identified several splice variants of human sbp <dig>  the most abundant of which encodes a mitochondrial targeted protein . interestingly, this splice isoform lacks both the lsad15- <dig> and pfvq44- <dig> motifs but retains the sbp2-specific motifs presented below. additionally, the authors suggested that mtsbp <dig> may be unique to humans based on comparison to other mammals and chicken.

sbp2l and sbp <dig> are further distinguished by the presence of highly conserved sequence motifs that are unique to each protein. figure  <dig> highlights these motifs in separate sbp <dig> and sbp2l multiple sequence alignments derived from the same species examined in figure  <dig>  in sbp2l, the conserved motifs include qtdf210- <dig>  dsgy265- <dig>  seis442- <dig>  tpvs622- <dig>  pise844- <dig> and ries1016- <dig>  in contrast there are only three sites of sbp2-specific conservation: dfpe216- <dig>  qepp380- <dig>  which includes the poly-lysine tract that has been shown to be active as a nuclear localization signal  <cit> , and iwkk816- <dig>  table  <dig> provides a summary of the occurrence of thee motifs in each species analyzed. interestingly, none of these regions are annotated in the ncbi conserved domains database, and psi-blast analysis does not link them to any other protein families , but the significant degree of identity across highly diverse species makes them important focal points for further investigation into the function and regulation of sbp <dig> and sbp2l. as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  we observed variability in the occurrence of some of the motifs, notably the lack of dfpe216- <dig> in frog and the lack of tpvs622- <dig> in the sea squirts  as well as a the hemichordate acorn worm . these results confirm the phylogeny shown in figure  <dig> demonstrating that sbp2l is not limited to deuterostomes since we identified sbp2l motifs in a mollusk , and an annelid worm . among the conserved motifs in sbp2l, tpvs622- <dig> is of interest because it lies between the sid and rbd, and the corresponding sequence in sbp <dig> is degenerate and has been found to be dispensable for sec incorporation activity  <cit> . considering that a dynamic interaction between the sid and rbd has been shown to be essential for sec incorporation  <cit> , it is likely that the interaction of the corresponding domains in sbp2l may be regulated by this conserved stretch of amino acids.

origins of the sbp2/sbp2l split
blast and blat searches against the genomes of lottia, capitella, and invertebrate deuterostomes  revealed that sbp2l is the only secis binding protein in these organisms. all vertebrate genomes sampled, however, encoded both sbp <dig> and sbp2l, suggesting that a gene duplication near the time of vertebrate emergence generated the paralogous sbp2/sbp2l pair. the paralogy of sbp <dig> and sbp2l in vertebrates is supported by their inferred phylogeny .

the 2r hypothesis posits that one round of whole genome duplication coincided with the divergence of vertebrates and urochordates  and a second round of whole genome duplication occurred with the divergence of jawless  and jawed vertebrates  <cit> . in the context of the 2r hypothesis, the time of sbp2/sbp2l divergence is uncertain. therefore, we sought to find sbp sequences in the sea lamprey  genome by blat search. we found two non-overlapping contigs  that contain parts of an rbd and sid, respectively. however, there does not appear to be sufficient sequence available to determine whether or not the sea lamprey genome encodes one or two secis binding proteins and therefore whether or not sbp2/sbp2l divergence occurred before or after the radiation of jawed vertebrates. since we have only been able to identify two sbps in vertebrates, this would suggest, in conjunction with the 2r hypothesis, that additional copies were lost soon after genome duplication.

while mammalian sbp2l has not been fully biochemically characterized, it is known that human ct-sbp2l , which contains the entirety of the sid and rbd, is not able to support sec incorporation and weakly binds the gpx <dig> secis element compared to rat ct-sbp <dig>   <cit> . nonetheless, the presence of just sbp2l in invertebrate deuterstomes and conservation of the sid and rbd between vertebrate sbp <dig> and sbp2l suggests that vertebrate sbp2l may play a role in regulating selenoprotein expression via interactions with secis elements. this begs the question as to whether there is a correlation between secis structure and the occurrence of sbp2l as the only sbp in an organism. to examine this potential correlation, we turned to the selenoprotein rich sea urchin s. purpuratus. we identified  <dig> secis elements from s. purpuratus using the secisearch algorithm in combination with the selenoprotein identification procedure previously described  <cit> . these were compared them to all  <dig> human secis elements in a multiple sequence alignment. interestingly, all  <dig> s. purpuratus secis elements were of the form  <dig> class. aligning the s. purpuratus secis elements failed to identify any novel characteristics that might explain the preferred association with sbp2l. additionally, aligning human secis elements with those from s. purpuratus and constructing a phylogeny with phyml did not generate any clades that could suggest potential human sbp2l targets . recently, takeuchi et al  <cit>  reported that sbp <dig> from d. melanogaster is only able to bind form  <dig> secis elements but that form  <dig> binding is conferred when the svrvy95- <dig> sequence in the sid was changed to that found in human sbp <dig> . however, the existence of only form  <dig> secis elements in s. purpuratus was not likely constrained by sbp2l sequence in this region as it contains a vilke motif. these results suggest that determinants in the secis element for sbp2l interaction lie outside of the sequences tested or in structural elements that cannot be detected by sequence alignments. overall, these results suggest that sbp2l is a bona fide sec incorporation factor in invertebrate deutoerstomes, but that it may have diverfed to fulfill a separate function in vertebrates.

conservation between sbp <dig> and sbp2l is not sufficient to promote sec insertion
since sbp2l possesses an rbd that differs from that in sbp <dig> at positions known to be required for secis binding, we hypothesized that a fusion protein consisting of the sbp2l sid and the sbp <dig> rbd may be able to support sec incorporation in vitro. to test this, we engineered an age i site in the non-conserved regions between the sid and rbd of ct-sbp2l and ct-sbp <dig> and swapped the domains yielding the following chimeric proteins: sbp2l467-647/sbp2586- <dig>  and sbp2399-585/sbp2l648- <dig> . figure 6a shows a schematic of the domain swap. sec incorporation activity of the chimeric proteins was determined by adding  <dig> fmol of each protein to an in vitro sec incorporation assay that measures the translation of luciferase mrna containing an in-frame uga codon and gpx <dig> secis element in the 3'-utr  <cit> . figure 6b shows the amount of sec incorporation activity obtained with each protein relative to that obtained with ct-sbp <dig>  as expected, ct-sbp2l was unable to promote sec incorporation. surprisingly, the sbp2l-sbp <dig> chimera was also unable to promote sec incorporation while the sbp2-sbp2l chimera retained 20% sec incorporation activity compared to ct-sbp <dig>  these data indicate that despite strong similarity between the sid regions in sbp <dig> and sbp2l, the latter is unable to promote sec incorporation in this assay even when appended to the sbp <dig> rbd. in order to determine whether the lack of sec incorporation activity observed for the chimeric proteins was due to a lack of secis element binding, we tested whether or not they could bind the gpx <dig> secis element by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . in vitro translated proteins  were incubated with wild-type or mutant  utp-labeled secis elements and the complexes resolved by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. this amount of ct-sbp <dig> is within the linear range of this binding assay . as expected, ct-sbp <dig> shifted wild-type but not mutant secis elements in which the auga motif in the secis core was deleted . consistent with previous results, ct-sbp2l secis binding activity was only ~20% relative to ct-sbp <dig> . interestingly, the sbp2l-sbp <dig> chimera specifically bound the wild-type secis element at ~80% the level of ct-sbp <dig>  while the sbp2-sbp2l chimera provided only 40% binding relative to ct-sbp <dig> . these results show that a lack of secis element binding does not explain the inability of the sbp2l-sbp <dig> chimera to support sec incorporation. in addition to secis element affinity, the sid is thought to play a role that is likely downstream of secis binding, such as promoting an eefsec or ribosomal conformational change. the key residues found to be required for a function downstream of secis element binding were from p <dig> to p <dig>  <cit> .

in light of this we wanted to know whether divergence of sbp2l and sbp <dig> in these regions were responsible for the inability of the sbp2l-sbp <dig> chimera to promote sec incorporation. specifically, a series of mutations were made such that either ct-sbp2l or the sbp2l-sbp <dig> chimera contained the following substitutions: d494g, ska556plm, ek563qr and a567p . using figure 3b as a reference, these substitutions cover the sites annotated as g <dig> and q <dig> . ct-sbp <dig> and the wild-type or mutant versions of ct-sbp2l and the sbp2l-sbp <dig> chimera were analyzed for their ability to support sec incorporation in vitro. figure 6e shows that none of the substitutions resulted in an active form of either ct-sbp2l or the sbp2l-sbp <dig> chimera. these results demonstrate that the chimeric protein either contains a negative element that actively prevents sec incorporation or that it is missing an as-yet undetermined element that is required. further analysis of the physical interaction between the sbp2l sid and the sbp <dig> rbd will be required to determine which is the more likely explanation for the inability of the sbp2l sid to support sec incorporation even when secis binding is restored.

the sbp <dig> l7ae rna binding domain arose from ribosomal protein l30
having established the phylogenetic relationship of metazoan sbps, we sought to determine whether we could elucidate the origins of sbp <dig>  as mentioned above, sbps contain an l7ae rna binding motif. this motif was identified by koonin and colleagues  <cit>  as a  <dig> amino acid motif  in primarily ribosomal and ribosome-associated proteins such as ribosomal protein l <dig> , rps <dig>  the translation termination factor erf <dig>  and rpl7a, among others. this motif features a universally conserved glycine residue  <dig> amino acids upstream of a  <dig> residue hydrophobic cluster  <cit> . the sbp <dig> l7ae motif is well characterized  <cit>  and has been shown to be responsible for sequence-specific secis element binding, although unlike rpl <dig>  <cit> , for example, high affinity binding requires a large stretch of sequence n-terminal to the core motif. in order to determine a putative evolutionary origin of the l7ae motif in sbp <dig> and sbp2l we aligned them with l7ae core sequences from other l7ae-containing proteins using muscle  and generated a maximum likelihood tree in phyml using the wag substitution model. the tree suggests that the sbp clade shared a common ancestor with the rpl <dig> and erf <dig> clades . interestingly, both rpl <dig> and rpl7a have been shown to possess secis binding activity, and the former was able to stimulate sec incorporation activity in cells while the latter was inhibitory. whether the ability of these proteins to bind secis elements is functionally significant, however, remains to be determined.

the sbp <dig> sid is of uncertain origin
while the sbp <dig> rna binding domain has clear evolutionary roots in ribosomal proteins, the sid is a protein domain that is unique to the sbp family with no apparent homology to other protein domains as efforts to identify molecular relatives by psi-blast failed. thus, it is possible that the sid arose de novo. regardless of its origin, the conservation of the sid core motif in the eukaryotic taxa presented here  suggests that it arose once in eukaryotic evolution and that organisms such as d. discoideum and plasmodium vivax with poorly conserved sid sequences likely diverged to adapt to as-yet unidentified unique requirements .

archaeal insight into sbp2
caban and colleagues recently performed structure/function studies on the sbp <dig> rna binding domain including its l7ae motif  <cit> . in this work they noted that sbp <dig> residues in the region of rfqdr654- <dig> n-terminal to the l7ae core were required for sec incorporation but not secis element or ribosome binding. interestingly, these residues are not conserved among the various subgroups of the l7ae superfamily. accordingly, we sought to determine whether or not this motif and residues in its vicinity had a discernible relative. a blastp search against the protein data bank with relaxed settings and rat sbp <dig> as a query expectedly yielded hits of various l7ae family members. however, this search also produced a hit for methanococcus jannaschii cbf <dig>  the h/aca srna guided pseudouridylate synthase . querying the cdd with rat sbp <dig> and relaxed settings  also yielded a hit against cbf <dig> . this corresponded to rat sbp2642- <dig> and and pyrococcus horikoshii cbf5125- <dig>  in addition, psi-blast using full length rat sbp <dig> as the initial query independently led to the identification of cbf <dig> as a potential relative . notably, the only region of significant similarity is that between rfqdr654- <dig> and the universally conserved gly residue in the l7ae rna binding motif . figure  <dig> shows a multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree illustrating the relationship between the cbf <dig> and sbp <dig>  the conservation of this region among the cbf <dig> group from archaea to mammals is quite high with strong clade support, but the highest level of conservation is between archaeal cbf <dig> and vertebrate sbp <dig>  the substantial divergence between the cbf <dig> motif and that observed in sbp <dig> from unicellular eukaryotes and protostomes and the short length of the motif suggests that it may have arisen as a result of convergent evolution.

this finding is intriguing as cbf <dig> is known to form a complex with l7ae as well as nop <dig>  gar <dig>  and box h/aca srnas, which contain kink-turn elements similar to that in secis elements  <cit> . in vivo, cbf <dig> catalyzes the site-specific pseudouridylation of rrna with the aid of guide h/aca srnas. minimally, cbf <dig> and nop <dig> are required for guided pseudouridylation but maximum activity requires all four h/aca srnp proteins  <cit> . the crystal structure of an archaeal h/aca srnp, showed that the cbf <dig> region found in our blast searches is physically distant and makes no direct contacts with l7ae  <cit> . part of the cbf <dig> region from our blast searches, though, interacts with the accessory protein gar <dig>  which has structural homology to domain ii of ef-tu, the bacterial translation elongation factor  <cit> , suggesting that this region within sbp <dig> may be required for eefsec binding. additionally, part of the cbf <dig> blast hit forms a 'thumb loop'  that has been proposed to stabilize substrate rna  <cit> . from this, we speculatively propose a model in which this cbf5-like region within sbp <dig> serves as a switch that regulates eefsec/sec-trnasec interactions.

mosquito sbp2: science imitates nature
chapple and guigó recently investigated evolutionary relationships of insect selenoproteins and sec incorporation factors  <cit> . in that work, a multiple sequence alignment of insect sbp <dig> showed that aedes aegypti sbp <dig> contains an rna binding domain but apparently lacks a sec incorporation domain. this is striking as sbp <dig> from other insects, including the mosquitoes a. gambiae and culex quinquefasciatus, contain a sec incorporation domain  <cit> . we therefore performed a blastp search with default parameters but limited to a. aegypti  using c. quinquefasciatus sbp <dig> as a query. this search yielded the previously identified a. aegypti sbp <dig> rbd  <cit>  and a. aegypti hypothetical protein aael_aael <dig>  which has 66% identity and 76% similarity to c. quinquefasciatus sbp23- <dig>  suggesting that the sid is encoded by a separate gene in a. aegypti. a blastp search against a. aegypti using the sid of rat sbp <dig>  as a query also identified the a. aegypti sid . a multiple sequence alignment of representative insect sid and rbd sequences is shown in figure 9a. phylogenetic inference of insect sbp <dig> using the wag substitution model in phyml placed a. aegypti sbp <dig> with that of other mosquitoes with strong bootstrap support .

blastx analysis of  <dig>  kb of genomic dna  upstream of the a. aegypti sbp <dig> rbd coding region did not detect any sequences similar to sbp <dig>  consulting the entrez gene database at ncbi  <cit>  for these genes showed that the a. aegypti sid and rbd were found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, further suggesting that sbp <dig> in a. aegypti is comprised of two separately encoded proteins. additional evidence that a. aegypti sbp <dig> is split comes from examining its genomic context relative to that of other insects. specifically, d. melanogaster and c. quinquefasciatus sbp <dig> are linked to the locus for gustatory receptor 66a, which flanks the a. aegypti sbp <dig> rbd . additionally, the sbp <dig> locus in c. quinquefasciatus is linked with a mitochondrial inner membrane protein translocase and an abc transporter, both of which are also linked with the locus for the sbp <dig> sid in a. aegypti . thus the a. aegypti sbp <dig> sid and rbd were likely separated by a translocation event. while the genomic sequences and predicted peptides suggest the a. aegypti sid and rbd are separate proteins, an est search revealed that  <dig> ests  corresponding to the rbd also encode amino acids 178- <dig> of the predicted sid peptide. it is also noteworthy that these ests do not code for a methionine residue upstream of the rbd suggesting that their 5' ends are incomplete and that the complete mrna could code for the entirety of sbp <dig>  this would be possible if the sid and rbd transcripts were joined by trans-splicing which has been previously reported in a. aegypti  <cit> . in the absence of an est set that covers the entirety of a. aegypti sbp <dig> it could still be possible for the sid and rbd to function as separate proteins as supported by recent work showing that combining recombinant rat sbp <dig> sid and rbd that have been physically separated can promote wild-type levels of sec incorporation in vitro  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this report represents the first phylogenetic analysis of sbps across eukaryotic taxa. since vertebrates possess two sbps, we annotated determinants that serve as identifying motifs in sbp2l and sbp <dig>  we showed that sbp2l is the likely progenitor of mammalian sbp <dig> and as the only form of secis binding protein in invertebrate deuterostomes, sbp2l is likely required for sec incorporation in these organisms. however, the role of sbp2l in vertebrates will require further experiments to elucidate its function, and we expect forthcoming experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. additionally the retention and loss of lsad and pvfq motifs in several taxa suggest that sbps are subject to diverse evolutionary pressures. conservation of the sid and rbd in unicellular eukaryotes and metazoans suggests that sbp <dig> arose once in eukaryotic evolution.

the origins of the sid and rbd, the essential domains for sbp <dig> function, may provide insight into the mechanism of sec incorporation. the apparent phylogenetic relationship between the sbp l7ae motif and rpl <dig> could provide insight into sbp2-ribosome interactions or reiterate a possible role for rpl <dig> in sec incorporation as suggested by chavatte  <cit> . the origin of the sid, however, is unclear and its relation to other proteins may require structural analysis. analysis of insect sbp <dig>  specifically that of a. aegypti, showed that its sid and rbd are coded by separate genes. future use of a. aegypti cell culture could provide a unique system in which to study sec incorporation. based on the taxa sampled here, we propose that secis binding proteins arose once in eukaryotic evolution and diverged substantially as in the case of p. vivax, t. gondii, and d. discoideum. additionally, the presence of sbp2l in some protostomes  but not in others  suggests that sbp2l sequences occurred in the last common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes followed by divergence in different lineages. lastly, a gene duplication event, possibly as the result of whole genome duplication, generated the paralogous pair of sbp <dig> and sbp2l in vertebrates.
