BACKGROUND
we are now in an era when we can routinely sequence the complete genomes of microbes and rapidly identify their protein coding complements. the sequences of millions of proteins are now known. despite this wealth of information we are still far from understanding how all of these proteins operate to give rise to a living organism. at present, in a consistent percentage of proteins the predicted function remains unknown  <cit> . from our analysis of  <dig> million proteins in the pfam sequence database , 20% of them have no associated pfam domain  <cit>  and more are classified into duf  families  <cit> . this uncharacterized set of proteins potentially contains novel biological systems. therefore, it is important to uncover these hidden functions through analysis of protein sequence, protein structure, and finally through directed experimental analyses  <cit> .

there have been various attempts to classify the multitude of protein sequences into families to facilitate an improved understanding of the functional repertoire of proteins. in addition, there is a growing number of protein families defined for which no protein has ever been previously experimentally characterized. these families have been called dufs  <cit>  or uncharacterized protein families   <cit> . the pfam database contains one of the largest collections of such families with over  <dig>  defined to date.

a novel domain, duf <dig>    , was found predominantly in bacteria, and to a lesser extent in archaea and eukaryota. recently, one protein  in this duf <dig> family was identified as lactate-utilization protein c , which was homologous to the ykgg protein in e. coli, hinting at a possible role in lactate utilization  <cit> . indeed, duf <dig> domain is a constituent domain of two proteins  encoded by the conserved lutabc operon in bacteria. this operon has been linked to lactate utilization  <cit>  and is implicated in the oxidative conversion of l-lactate into pyruvate  <cit> . based on our analysis of its sequence, structure, and recent experimental evidence reported by other groups, we hereby redefine duf <dig> domain as the lud domain.

here, we report the first crystal structure  of the lud domain family: lutc protein  from deinococcus radiodurans <cit>  at  <dig>  Å resolution. we propose a model for the substrate and cofactor binding and regulation.

RESULTS
lud domain structure
the joint center for structural genomics  determined the first crystal structure of the lud domain family: lutc protein from deinococcus radiodurans. the lutc protein structure is a mixed alpha-helix and beta-sheet protein . the protein core is made up of two orthogonal beta-sheets, each consisting of four beta-strands. the alpha-helices are packed against the two solvent-facing surfaces of the beta-sheets as well as against the side openings of the protein core.

some regions of the lutc protein sequence are highly conserved as assessed by consurf. the conserved areas are concentrated on one side of the structure and form a groove about 20 Å in length , which might be functionally important. lutc protein appears to be dimeric, with a buried surface of 1721 Å <dig> at the dimer-interface. the highly conserved area coincides with parts of the dimer interface.

structural alignment with other protein structures present in the protein data bank, using the program dali  <cit> , suggests lutc protein is structurally akin to proteins found in the isocot superfamily  <cit> . this is consistent with its classification in scop  <cit>  as part of the nagb/rpia/coa transferase-like fold and superfamily. the isocot superfamily is known to comprise proteins of diverse functions including sugar isomerases, translation factor eif2b, ligand-binding domains of the deor-family transcription factors, acetyl-coa transferases, and methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase  <cit> .

domain organization
while predominantly found to exist by itself, lud domain is also frequently found together with domains such as the 4fe-4s dicluster domain fer4_ <dig> , duf <dig> , and cysteine-rich iron-sulfur binding cluster domain ccg   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the most common domain architectures featuring the lud domain according to pfam release  <dig> .

lud domain-containing proteins encoded by the highly conserved lutabc operon
lud domain is a protein domain of approximately  <dig> residues in length . it is found in two proteins encoded by the highly conserved lutabc operon , which appears in a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the lutabc operon was found to be important for growth and biofilm formation in bacillus subtilis <cit> . the lud domain is found in both lutb and lutc proteins encoded by the lutabc operon. in the vast majority of cases, the lud domain is the only constituent domain of lutc proteins, whereas in lutb proteins it is often associated with protein families fer4_ <dig>  ccg, or duf <dig> . indeed, in pfam release  <dig>  there is just one instance of lutb protein being made of duf <dig> alone, which occurs in deinococcus radiodurans . however, searching the section of dna in deinococcus radiodurans from the start of lutb to the start of lutc finds a frame-shift and a copy of duf <dig> on the opposite strand, though no apparent fer4_ <dig>  implying possible poor quality sequencing in this region. finally, luta protein is most often made of two copies of ccg domains. both fer4_ <dig> and ccg domains are likely iron-sulfur cluster binding domains  <cit> . luta protein is a putative iron-sulfur heterodisulfide reductase; lutb protein a putative iron-sulfur oxidoreductase; lutc protein a putative subunit of an iron-sulfur protein. together, they are thought to mediate the oxidation of lactate via a cytochrome-like electron transfer chain, though the precise roles played by lutabc remain unclear  <cit> .

presence in gut microbiome
it is worth noting that lud domain has an increased abundance in gut microbiome. from our comparative genomics analysis of the metahit human gut microbiome of  <dig> human subjects , the average ratio of number of homologs from the metahit human gut microbiome versus those found in uniprotkb is about  <dig> . the ratio for lud domain is ten times higher at  <dig> , suggesting it plays a significant role in the gut microbiome, possibly related to its role in anaerobic metabolism. interestingly, lactic acid bacteria  are being used as probiotics  <cit> . lactate metabolism is integral to human health and host-pathogen interactions. pathogenic bacteria have been shown to decrease local ph in hosts, through an increase in lactate production, so as to facilitate the release of iron from host transferrin  <cit> . in other species, acquisition of lactate is necessary for bacteremia  <cit>  and colonization  <cit> . lactate is also a potent signaling molecule in inflammatory pathways and has emerged as a critical regulator of cancer development, maintenance and metastasis  <cit> . by modulating lactate concentrations in the host’s environment through lud domains and other lactate-related pathways, lactobacilli could thus influence the outcomes of both pathogenicity and disease  <cit> .

model for lud domain substrate-cofactor binding and regulation
inspection of the lutc protein dimer structure identified a highly conserved cavity  near the dimer interface. we proposed this cavity to be the putative active site , where the oxidative conversion of lactate into pyruvate occurs  <cit> , based on the following observations: first, the residues surrounding this cavity are highly conserved, suggesting they are functionally important. second, this cavity is large enough to accommodate both nad + and lactate, hypothetical cofactor and substrate . nad is among the top  <dig> possible ligands for lutc dimer as predicted by isocleft  <cit> . top ligand predicted by isocleft predicted was ndp . third, in the docking model the highly conserved h <dig> in lutc protein is located close to the substrate-cofactor reaction site and could hence serve as the catalytic histidine. fourth, the 11-residue disordered loop  near this cavity could function as a substrate binding regulator, analogous to the role played by the disordered loop in the active site of lactate dehydrogenase , which converts pyruvate to lactate  <cit> . taken together, it is likely that this pocket is indeed the active site.

another moderately conserved cavity lined by residues r <dig>  c <dig>  and d <dig> , roughly coincides with the isocot superfamily primary binding site. docking of nad to this shallow and small cavity leaves it not fully embedded and partially exposed. thus, it is unlikely to form the active site. nevertheless, this cavity could bind smaller molecules and is a good candidate for allosteric regulation. allosteric regulation has been reported for certain proteins of the isocot superfamily  <cit> .

functional implications in deinococcus radiodurans
the lutc protein was selected as a target because of the interest in deinococcus radiodurans by jcsg. deinococcus radiodurans is the most radiation-resistant bacterium known to date  <cit> . it can survive  <dig> gray  of irradiation, a dose hundreds of times greater than that considered lethal for most organisms. how it accomplishes such a remarkable feat remains enigmatic. a study examining global gene expression following ionizing radiation exposure and desiccation allowed a dissection of the response to double strand breaks  and oxidative stress associated with reactive oxygen species . lutc protein was not induced in either treatment but was constitutively expressed  <cit> . free radicals, in particular ros, generated when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation, are cytotoxic. the unpaired electrons of free radicals render them highly reactive with biological molecules. unsaturated fatty acids present in the membrane are particularly susceptible to free radicals. furthermore, free radical-oxygen will deplete oxygen in the cytosol and abolish aerobic metabolism. anaerobic lactate metabolism can be an indispensable alternative energy source. moreover, lactate can function as a scavenger of free radicals  <cit> . thus, lactate utilization may contribute to the radiation-resistance of the deinococcus radiodurans. as the lutc protein from deinococcus radiodurans represents a prototypical lud domain in lactate utilization, it could be contributing towards radiation-resistance in this bacterium.

CONCLUSIONS
lactate metabolism is integral to human health, and may play a role in the radiation resistance in deinococcus radiodurans. the lud domain is a highly conserved protein domain that has recently been identified to play a role in lactate metabolism. in this report, we described the crystal structure of the deinococcus radiodurans lutc protein, the first for a member of the lud domain family. using sequence and structure analysis, we proposed a model for the substrate and cofactor binding and regulation in lud domains. we also analyzed possible implications for radiation resistance in deinococcus radiodurans. further experimental characterization will be needed to test these hypotheses.
