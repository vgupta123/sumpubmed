BACKGROUND
5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase  or epsp synthase  is the sixth and penultimate enzyme in the shikimate pathway  <cit> . epsps activity and the shikimate pathway are essential for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, and for various secondary metabolites derived from the precursor chorismate, such as lignin, auxin, alkaloids, carotenoids, vitamins, and phenolic compounds  <cit> . the synthesis of these compounds is essential to plant health and growth. epsps enzyme is potently inhibited by glyphosate, a non-selective herbicide widely used in weed management. a mutation in epsps is one mechanism conferring glyphosate resistance to weeds and crops. the amino acid substitution from proline at amino acid position  <dig> in epsps to serine, threonine, leucine, or alanine results in glyphosate resistance in weed species . thus, knowledge about the wheat epsps gene sequence, expression, exon-intron structure, and the development of genome-specific primers will be useful for examining natural and induced mutations in wheat epsps, as well as for detecting transgene contamination. for example, genome-specific primers and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  methods for measuring epsps mrna levels are useful for determining if glyphosate resistance results from increased epsps expression levels, as previously described in dicliptera chinensis   <cit> . the development of genome-specific primers may be useful to researchers investigating whether there are naturally occurring mutations in the wheat epsps genes if glyphosate resistant wheat is found in farmers’ fields. it is also interesting from the perspective of investigating wheat genome evolution based on the epsps sequence.

currently, there is not a transgenic glyphosate-resistant wheat cultivar available for use by growers due in part to lack of acceptance by export markets. common wheat  or bread wheat is one of the major food grain crops belonging to the grass poaceae family. the hybridization between the diploid aa genome-donor and the bb genome-donor generated the allotetraploid t. turgidum  or durum wheat that is currently grown for use in pasta . the diploid a-genome donor is believed to have been t. urartu , or a relative of the ancient crop plant einkorn t. monococcum . the diploid b-genome donor is an unknown species , but related to ae. speltoides . subsequently, diploid ae. tauschii  hybridized to tetraploid wheat, giving rise to the allohexaploid bread wheat . the large 17-gigabase allohexaploid wheat genome is comprised of  <dig> chromosomes  with three sets of  <dig> chromosomes derived from each related  subgenome  of the three diploid ancestors . the  <dig> wheat chromosomes are designated based on the  <dig> homoeologous chromosome group and three genomes, such that we refer to chromosome 1a, 1b, 1d through chromosome 7a, 7b, and 7d. allohexaploid wheat behaves like a diploid during meiosis such that chromosome 7a can only pair with 7a, not with 7b or 7d. the wheat genome has also evolved through translocation events  <cit> . for example, a segment of chromosome 7bs translocated to 4al, and a segment of 4al translocated to 5al. both gene cloning and gene expression analysis in wheat are complicated by the inherent genetic redundancy and by a large portion  of non-coding dna  <cit> . consequently, development of high quality genome-specific primers for wheat genes of interest is essential.

the epsps enzymes of different species are divided into two classes according to glyphosate sensitivity. the class i epsps enzymes found in plants and bacteria  are glyphosate sensitive and have been used to characterize the enzyme kinetics and active site  <cit> . the class ii epsps found in bacterial species including agrobacterium tumefaciens sp. strain cp <dig>  pseudomonas sp. strain pg <dig>  and staphylococcus aureus are glyphosate resistant and have been used to develop glyphosate-resistant crops  <cit> . the epsps of plants is nuclear-encoded but functions in the chloroplast. thus, the premature epsps polypeptide contains an n-terminal transit peptide signal that is cleaved upon transport into the chloroplast  <cit> .

wheat epsps primers for pcr cloning based upon the epsps mrna sequence of chinese spring wheat and upon wheat expressed sequence tag  sequences were developed as part of this work. pcr is a simple and powerful technique used in molecular studies such as gene cloning, gene expression analysis, and disease diagnosis. pcr approaches have been successfully used in the isolation of homoeologous genes from hexaploid wheat and in quantification of gene expression from related genomes of hexaploid wheat . the development of wheat genome-specific primers has been challenging due to:  the large portion of non-coding dna in the wheat genome,  the low level of polymorphism in the coding sequences of wheat homoeologues, and  the lack of a reference genome sequence. the recent publication of the  <dig> x draft genome sequence of chinese spring wheat and of the ‘kukri’ wheat transcript assembly will help future wheat cloning efforts  <cit> .

herein, we cloned the taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig> genes from the allohexaploid spring wheat cultivar ‘louise’, as well as the homologous epsps cdna sequences of four wheat progenitors. this allowed us to examine the evolution of the wheat epsps gene based on phylogenetic sequence analyses. the development of genome-specific epsps primers allowed us to examine the chromosome location of the wheat epsps genes and to compare the expression levels of the three homoeologous wheat epsps transcripts.

RESULTS
initial cdna cloning revealed two major expressed homoeologous epsps genes
preliminary experiments cloned wheat epsps cdna sequences using primer pairs designed based on an alignment of two t. monococcum and thirteen t. aestivum  ests to amplify epsps sequence from all three wheat genomes . cloning and sequencing of cdna from allohexaploid wheat ‘louise’ and from the wheat relatives t. monococcum, ae. speltoides, ae. tauschii, and t. turgidum was used to determine which primer pair could amplify the largest cdna fragment from all wheat genomes and relatives. rt-pcr amplification with primer pairs f2-r <dig>  f2-r <dig>  and f2-r <dig> produced products from all lines but for ae. speltoides, whereas f3-r <dig>  f3-r <dig>  and f3-r <dig> produced products from all genotypes including ae. speltoides. the f3-r <dig> primer pair was selected for use in cdna cloning because it produced the largest fragment, 1190-bp, containing the epsps coding region from exons  <dig> to  <dig> based on alignment with rice epsps .table  <dig> primer sequences and primer positions based on taepsps-7a1

the 1190-bp epsps cdna clones from the wheat species above were sequenced and aligned. consensus sequences were derived from eleven independent clones from allohexaploid wheat and from three independent clones from each wheat progenitor . the 1190-bp cdna clones from the same species had 96−100 % nucleotide identity. allohexaploid wheat was expected to have three functional copies of epsps, one each on the a, b, and d genomes  <cit> . the cdna alignment revealed that there were two clusters of epsps cdna sequences, one with high homology to the d genome donor ae. tauschii  and one with high homology to t. turgidum  . the remaining two clones, t.a_cdna <dig> and t.a_cdna <dig> appeared to be chimeras, and may either be pcr artifacts or may represent epsps-related sequence from the wheat genome. the preliminary identification of the wheat epsps-ab and epsps-d cdna sequences allowed the design of genome-specific primers using sequences containing multiple point mutation differences . mapping later revealed that the epsps-ab primer pair f18-ab-r16-ab amplified taepsps-7a <dig>  on chromosome 7a, and the epsps-d primer pair f18-d-r16-d amplified taepsps-7d <dig> on chromosome 7d .fig.  <dig> nucleotide polymorphisms from an alignment of epsps cdna sequences of allohexaploid wheat and wheat progenitors. vertical lines in the diagram indicate the position of nucleotide polymorphisms identified in a clustalw multiple sequence alignment of the 1190-bp cdna clones from t. aestivum ‘louise’ , with our 1190-bp cdna consensus sequences for t. turgidum  , ae. tauschii  , t. monococcum  , and ae. speltoides  . the equivalent 1190-bp sequence of the genomic dna consensus sequences of “taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a1” are shown with intron sequences removed. only the taepsps-7a <dig> and taepsps-7d <dig> cdnas were recovered by f3-r <dig> pcr amplification. the corresponding 1190-bp taepsps-4a <dig> cdna sequence  was derived from an independent experiment



molecular cloning of a full-length genomic clone of taepsps-7a1
in the cdna cloning experiment, no primers upstream of f <dig> amplified the 5’ region of epsps, likely because it is highly gc-rich . the primer f <dig>  was designed to amplify this region upstream of f <dig> . eight different buffers designed to enhance the amplification efficiency of gc-rich targets were tested using the primer pair f <dig> -r <dig> for pcr amplification of epsps from genomic dna . based on the rice epsps gene, the full length wheat epsps genomic clone was expected to be approximately  <dig> -kb. pcr amplification with f <dig> -r <dig> recovered  <dig> -kb, 2-kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig> -kb products. cloning and sequencing revealed that the 2-kb,  <dig> -kb, and  <dig> -kb products contained no homology to epsps. all of the four independent  <dig> -kb clones contained a 3345-bp sequence with high identity  to the epsps-ab cdna clones. the 3345-bp consensus sequence, designated taepsps-7a <dig> , appeared to contain the full length wheat coding sequence based on alignment with rice epsps  . based on alignment with the wheat epsps-ab cdna and osepsps, taepsps-7a <dig> is spliced into a 1533-bp cdna encoding a predicted  <dig> amino acid protein with  <dig>  % amino acid identity to osepsps .fig.  <dig> exon-intron structure of the wheat epsps genes compared to osepsps. the boxes and solid lines represent exons  and introns , respectively. numbers indicate exon and intron size in bp. the cleavage site of the chloroplastic transit signal peptide  predicted by predsl is shown. the positions of the primers f <dig> , f <dig>  and r <dig>  used for initial genomic and cdna cloning are labeled

isolation of taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a1
polymorphic intron and exon sequences were used to develop genome-specific primers to clone and map the taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a <dig> genes   <cit> . pcr amplification using louise genomic dna and the primer-pair combinations f13-ab-r <dig>  f14-d-r <dig>  and f3-r <dig> recovered epsps sequences containing polymorphisms compared to taepsps-7a <dig>  the f14-d-r <dig> primer pair amplified 600-bp and 838-bp, f13-ab-r <dig> amplified a 647-bp, and f3-r <dig> amplified a 838-bp product. the 600-bp  and 838-bp  products shared exon regions with 100 % identity to the 1190-bp epsps-d and of ae. tauschii cdna sequences . thus, two partial taepsps-7d <dig> genomic clones were identified. cloning and sequencing revealed that the 647-bp  product was a partial genomic clone of taepsps-4a <dig> based on lack of homology to taepsps-7a <dig> and the taepsps-7d <dig>  attempts to amplify the 5’ genomic region of the taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a <dig> open reading frame  using combinations of f <dig>  and several reverse primers designed to be 4a- and 7d-specific based on intronic sequences failed to recover a product, suggesting that the f <dig>  primer is specific to taepsps-7a <dig> .

nested inverse-pcr  strategies were devised to clone the remaining genomic sequences of taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a <dig>   <cit> . primers were developed for the d genome copy based on the 600-bp  taepsps-7d <dig> clone, and for the taepsps-4a <dig> based on the 647-bp product. taepsps-7d <dig> genomic sequence was recovered from f18-d-r18-d amplification of circularized acci-digested genomic dna. the resulting 1261-bp clone included 1114-bp of taepsps-7d <dig> plus 147-bp of 7d chromosome sequence flanking the 3’end of the taepsps-7d <dig> gene. invf3-ab-invr2-ab amplification of the hindiii- and acci-digested dna template recovered 702-bp and 682-bp products, respectively. the 702-bp product overlapped with the taepsps-7d <dig> genomic sequence, whereas the 682-bp  fragment contained taepsps-4a <dig> sequences.

genome-specific primers were designed for pcr amplification of longer genomic clones of the taepsps-4a <dig>  and taepsps-7d <dig> . sequencing of these clones in both directions recovered the missing genomic sequences of both taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a <dig> . thus, we recovered the genomic sequences of taepsps-7d <dig>  and of taepsps-4a <dig>  including a partial sequence for intron  <dig> and complete sequences for the remaining introns and for exons  <dig> through  <dig> 

determining the chromosome location of the wheat epsps genes
pcr amplification of genomic dna from nulli-tetrasomic chinese spring wheat lines was used to determine the chromosome location and to confirm primer specificity during the cdna and genomic cloning of taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-4a <dig>  and taepsps-7d <dig>   <cit> . for mapping, pcr amplification of nulli-tetrasomic genomic dna was performed using gene-specific primers . the location of each epsps copy was defined based on failed pcr amplification in a specific nulli-tetrasomic line. primers for the taepsps-7d <dig> failed to show amplification using the nulli7d-tetra7b  as the genomic dna template. similarly, the taepsps-4a <dig> and taepsps-7a <dig> primers failed to amplify using the nulli4a-tetra4d  and the nulli7a-tetra7d  as template, respectively. thus, each wheat epsps clone was identified based on its chromosome location on 7a, 4a, and 7d, respectively.fig.  <dig> mapping the chromosome locations of the wheat epsps genes using nulli-tetrasomic lines. pcr amplification was performed using indicated chinese spring nulli-tetrasomic genomic dna. these lines contain no copy of one chromosome , and  <dig> doses  of a homoeologous chromosome. the lines are referred to as nulli1a-tetra1d or n1a-t1d, n2a-t2d, etc. dna was amplified with the indicated primer pairs for: a
taepsps-7d <dig> failed to amplify in n7d-t7b line with primers f18-d-r16-d indicating localization to chromosome 7d;  taepsps-7a <dig> failed to amplify in n7a-t7d with indicated primers;  taepsps-4a <dig> failed to amplify in n4a-t4d



homoeologous genes of common wheat are usually located on the same group of chromosomes. for example, the wheat pdi  homoeologues positioned on group  <dig> , dmc <dig>  on group  <dig>  and rad <dig>  and ssii  on group  <dig>  <cit> . the three wheat epsps genes belong to homoeologous group  <dig>  since the allohexaploid wheat genome contains a chromosomal translocation from chromosome 7bs onto 4al that occurred in the tetraploid ancestor  <cit> . we identified clones with high identity to taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig> on chromosomes 7as, 7ds, and 4al, respectively, in the  <dig> x draft chinese spring wheat genome sequence  <cit> . this confirmed the chromosomal location of the wheat epsps genes.

we also observed that the taepsps-7a <dig> primers failed to amplify a pcr product from the nulli5b-tetra5d line  . no homologue of taepsps-7a <dig> was identified on chromosome 5b of the  <dig> x chinese spring draft sequence. moreover, there could not be a copy of taepsps-7a <dig> on chromosome 5b because such a duplication would resulted in presence of a taepsps-7a <dig> pcr product in both the nulli7a-tetra7d and nulli5b-tetra5d lines. thus, it appears that the nulli5b-tetra5d line contained a deletion of the taepsps-7a <dig> gene. consistent with this reasoning, a previous study of chromosome aberrations in nulli-tetrasomic lines showed that the nulli5b-tetra5d line contains a deletion in the chromosome 7as region that likely contains taepsps-7a <dig>  <cit> .

the cloning experiments described here were initiated before publication of the  <dig> x chinese spring draft sequence, and provide new sequence and expression information  <cit> . the chinese spring taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig> genomic dna contigs were incomplete . they included a partial sequence of intron  <dig> and genomic sequence downstream of intron  <dig>  but lacked the gc-rich exon  <dig> sequence recovered here for taepsps-7a <dig> from louise spring wheat. iwgsc recovered two overlapping cdna clones  with  <dig> − <dig>  % similarity to taepsps-7a <dig>  but did not recover cdna clones for taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a <dig>  the taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a <dig> cdna clones recovered in the current study proved that these genes are expressed.

recovery of cdna sequence of taepsps-4a1
the cdna clones of taepsps-7a <dig> and taepsps-7d <dig>  but not of taepsps-4a <dig>  were recovered from total seedling rna by rt-pcr amplification with the f3-r <dig> primer pair. based on the genomic sequence, the f3-r <dig> primers should also amplify the taepsps-4a <dig> cdna. to determine whether taepsps-4a <dig> is a pseudogene or a low-abundance transcript, we attempted to clone the taepsps-4a <dig> cdna using gene-specific primer pairs. f3-ex6_b-r <dig> and ex6_b-f-r <dig> amplified 874-bp and 470-bp products respectively, using ‘louise’ cdna as a template . five independent clones from each product were sequenced. all 470-bp clones had 100 % identity to the taepsps-4a <dig> exon sequences. the f3-ex6_b-r <dig> primers were less taepsps-4a1-specific, since one 874-bp clone corresponded to taepsps-4a <dig>  three to taepsps-7d <dig>  and one to taepsps-7a <dig>  the complete 1190-bp taepsps-4a <dig> cdna sequence was derived from the two overlapping 874-bp and 470-bp clones . thus, taepsps-4a <dig> may be expressed at lower levels than taepsps-7a <dig> and taepsps-7d <dig> in seedlings.

expression levels of the three wheat epsps homoeologues
we examined the relative expression levels of taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig> in seedlings using rt-qpcr analysis. expression was examined at the  <dig> to 5-leaf stage because glyphosate is typically foliar-applied to young seedlings, and because epsps expression can be higher in leaves than in roots  <cit> . rt-qpcr analysis revealed that all three wheat epsps transcripts were actively expressed, but accumulated at different levels . the taepsps-7a <dig> transcript was most highly expressed, showing 3-fold higher expression than taepsps-7d <dig> and almost 9-fold higher expression than taepsps-4a <dig> . the taepsps-4a <dig> mrna levels were significantly lower than taepsps-7d <dig> . the relatively low taepsps-4a <dig> mrna levels were consistent with the difficulty recovering the taepsps-4a <dig> cdna using the f3-r <dig> primer pair that was able to bind all three transcripts.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr analysis of wheat epsps gene expression in seedlings. the relative expression levels of taepsps-7a <dig> , taepsps-7d <dig> , and taepsps-4a <dig>  were determined by rt-qpcr using genome-specific primers . the fold change was calculated relative to the taepsps-4a <dig> mrna level  using the comparative cq method. letters  represent significant differences . bars indicate the standard error



the differential expression of taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig> may have evolved after the polyploidization event. previous studies have examined wheat gene expression in synthetic allohexaploid wheat generated through man-made polyploidization events. in such synthetic allohexaploids, as many as 87 % of wheat genes were expressed at similar levels from the a, b, and d genomes, although sometimes there was expression predominantly from one or two homoeologues   <cit> . a homoeologue may be lost through deletion or may become silenced during wheat genome evolution  <cit> . moreover, differential regulation may result from evolution of regulatory mechanisms through mutations in promoters or enhancer regions  <cit> .

sequence comparison and gene structure
cloning of the cdna and genomic clones for taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig> allowed us to compare the sequence and intron/exon structures of the three wheat epsps homoeologues . the complete taepsps-7a <dig> coding sequence  was cloned, including the 3342-bp orf, and the 1533-bp cdna encoding a predicted  <dig> amino acid protein . the taepsps-4a <dig>  and taepsps-7d <dig>  genomic clones included all intron and exon sequences except exon  <dig> and a portion of intron  <dig>  based on the 1190-bp cdna and incomplete genomic sequences of taepsps-7d <dig> and taepsps-4a <dig>  we can derive partial 1224-bp cdna sequences containing exons  <dig> through  <dig>  but not exon  <dig>  the 1224-bp cdna partial sequence encodes a predicted  <dig> amino acid epsps enzyme  . the wheat epsps proteins show higher homology to the glyphosate-sensitive class i epsps of rice  than to the glyphosate-resistant class ii epsps of cp <dig>    <cit> .

based on previous characterization of epsps in amaranthus palmeri, petunia hybrida, and arabidopsis thaliana, we expected exon  <dig> to contain the chloroplastic signal peptide  <cit> . epsps is a nuclear-encoded protein that must be transported to the chloroplast. the chloroplastic transit signal peptide of the epsps protein sequence is cleaved once the protein is located in the chloroplast  <cit> . predsl was used to search for the expected chloroplastic signal peptide  <cit> . a chloroplastic signal peptide was detected in exon  <dig> of taepsps-7a <dig> . these signal peptide amino acid sequences were highly conserved in other grasses including b. distachyon, o. sativa, sorghum halepense, and zea mays. based on the cleavage point for the chloroplastic signal peptide, the cloned regions of the taepsps-4a <dig> and taepsps-7d <dig> include all but the first  <dig> amino acids of the enzyme.

the gene structure of each epsps copy was originally predicted using netgene <dig> and neutral network splice-junction analysis programs  <cit> , and then confirmed by comparing genomic and cdna sequences . when the genomic and cdna sequences were aligned using the geneious™ global alignment tool, the actual splice junctions were identical to those predicted and to those of rice and a. palmeri   <cit> . there was a higher frequency of snp and in/del variation within intron than exon sequences among the three wheat epsps sequences . at the genomic dna level, taepsps-7d <dig> had higher homology to taepsps-4a <dig>  than to taepsps-7a <dig>  . the three wheat epsps homoeologues were very similar, with more than 96 % and 99 % identity at the cdna and amino acid levels, respectively.

phylogenetic analysis of the epsps genes of allohexaploid wheat
phylogenetic analyses of wheat epsps were conducted using the 1190-bp cdna sequences of taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig>  and of the wheat relatives t. turgidum  , t. monococcum  , ae. speltoides  , and ae. tauschii   . note that only a single consensus sequence was derived from the tetraploid t. turgidum. the taepsps-7d <dig> cdna clone was in the same clade as ae. tauschii, consistent with evidence that the d-genome was incorporated into allohexaploid wheat fairly recently  <cit> . taepsps-4a <dig> was most closely related to the b-genome relative ae. speltoides, consistent with our interpretation that taepsps-4a <dig> is the b-genome copy of epsps, likely located within the 7bs translocation to chromosome 4al. interestingly, epsps from the a-genome relative t. monococcum is more closely related to taepsps-4a <dig> than to taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7a <dig> was very closely related to the cdna cloned from tetraploid t. turgidum .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of epsps genes of wheat and wheat relatives. the upgma method was used to analyze nucleotide sequence similarity based on the 1190-bp cdna sequences. numbers at each branch indicate the genetic distance



phylogenetic analysis indicated that the taepsps-7a <dig> and taepsps-7d <dig> genes are most closely related to those of the most recent progenitors, tetraploid t. turgidum  and diploid ae. tauschii , respectively. taepsps-7a <dig> is more closely related to the epsps cloned from t. turgidum  than from the a-genome donor relative t. monococcum  or the b-genome relative ae. speltoides . taepsps-4a <dig>  however, is more closely related to the b-genome relative ae. speltoides  than to t. turgidum , and is consistent with previous analyses concluding that homoeologues of t. aestivum  are more closely related to homologues in ae. tauschii  and t. turgidum  than to the primitive a- and b-genome ancestors  <cit> . it appears that the diploid a- and b-genome progenitors of allohexaploid wheat have evolved independently from t. turgidum following the tetraploidization event, whereas the d-genome donor ae. tauschii is still very closely related to the d-genome of t. aestivum . moreover, t. monococcum has evolved independently from t. turgidum since its last shared ancestor with the wild einkorn a-genome progenitor t. urartu. the genetic variation in the wheat a- and b-genome epsps homoeologues appears to have resulted from the accumulation of point mutations, small dna insertions/deletions, and genetic recombination, likely following the polyploidization event  .

the phylogenetic relationship of the three wheat epsps 1190-bp cdna sequences was also examined compared to the corresponding sequence in other grasses using the dicot a. thaliana as the outgroup . the three taepsps genes were most closely related to epsps of l. multiflorum and b. distachyon and more distantly related to epsps of rice. the remaining clade includes monocots z. mays, s. halepense, and eleusine indica.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of epsps genes of grass species. the 1190-bp cdna sequences of taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-4a <dig>  and taepsps-7d <dig> from allohexaploid wheat ‘louise’ were compared to the corresponding epsps sequences from other species using the neighbor-joining method with the dicot a. thaliana as the outgroup. numbers at each branch represent the genetic distance. the epsps homologues include a. thaliana , b. distachyon , e. indica , s. halepense , z. mays , o. sativa , and l. multiflorum 



allohexaploid wheat, l. multiflorum, and model plant b. distachyon are believed to have originated from a common ancestor that diverged from rice about  <dig> million years ago , whereas the grasses in general are believed to have shared a common ancestor about  <dig> mya  <cit> . a comparative genome analysis between wheat and b. distachyon suggested that these two species diverged at 32– <dig> mya  <cit> . moreover, analysis of acetyl-coa carboxylase  and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase  genes between wheat and ryegrass  revealed that they diverged about  <dig> mya  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the study reports the cloning, sequencing, and mapping of three homoeologous epsps genes named taepsps-7a <dig> , taepsps-7d <dig> , and taepsps-4a <dig>  from allohexaploid wheat cultivar ‘louise’. the genes were located on chromosomes 7as, 4al , and 7ds, respectively. the comparison of cdna and genomic dna sequences allowed confirmation of the intron/exon structure, as well as the development of genome-specific primers. rt-qpcr analysis revealed that all three epsps homoeologues are actively transcribed. however, taepsps-7a <dig> had the highest level of expression in young leaves. the three epsps genes had a high degree of sequence conservation at both the cdna and protein levels. phylogenetic analysis suggests that the epsps of wheat is closely related to epsps of l. multiflorum and b. distachyon.
