BACKGROUND
the modern distribution of living organisms has been shaped by multiple processes that had profound effects on the dispersal, genetic structure and evolutionary histories of plant and animal populations. movements of land-masses and successive multiple glacial events that occurred during the pleistocene caused severe habitat changes which confined many species to warmer refugia and led other taxa to experience demographic reductions or complete extinction  <cit> . favourable periods during climatic fluctuations allowed successive population expansions, together with the recolonization of portions of the ancient ranges  <cit> .

despite the high potential dispersive power of flying birds, it is striking that only a few taxa did colonize most of the world. excluding seabirds, for which the distribution pattern depends more on ocean basins than on the major land-masses  <cit> , only six landbird species  are known to be cosmopolitan, breeding in each biogeographical region of the world, except antarctica. this group includes the great egret ardea alba, the cattle egret bubulcus ibis, the glossy ibis plegadis falcinellus, the barn owl tyto alba, the peregrine falcon falco peregrinus and the osprey pandion haliaetus.

the osprey is a medium-sized raptor with flexible breeding habitat requirements across its range. despite its specialization as a piscivore, it is an opportunistic forager that can feed in both freshwater and marine environments  <cit> . northern populations are known to migrate long distances  <cit> , whereas individuals from lower latitudes  are mostly sedentary, or perform small-scale interbreeding movements  <cit> . one could therefore predict that such broad habitat tolerances and high mobility should homogenize genomes, limiting genetic differentiation across populations at a continental level, as described in other widespread raptors . however, adult ospreys tend to return to their natal area to breed  <cit>  and such strong philopatry may have played in favour of genetic structuring among populations across the extensive range. similarly, genetic differences may be expected between long-distance migratory and partially migratory/resident populations.

on the basis of comparative non-molecular characters such as osteology, pelvic musculature and the distribution of feather tracts, the osprey is considered sufficiently distinct from other raptor species  to merit a monotypic family   <cit> . the most widely accepted taxonomic arrangement recognises four subspecies of osprey: p. h. haliaetus  in the palearctic from europe, northwest africa, and asia north of the himalayas, p. h. carolinensis  in north america, p. h. ridgwayi  in caribbean islands, and p. h. cristatus  in the indo-pacific and oceania . the four subspecies were traditionally split on the basis of morphometry and plumage characteristics, but the differences are not straightforward  <cit> . therefore, referring only to morphology for describing diversity and interrelationships between subspecies has led to controversies in taxonomy.fig.  <dig> geographical distribution of pandion haliaetus. ranges for the four recognized subspecies are in different colors: black for carolinensis, red for ridgwayi, orange for haliaetus and green for cristatus. horizontal stripes are for breeding areas, skew lines for wintering areas and color-filled zones represent areas with sedentary populations. black circles symbolize sample locations. in the small boxes  three zones are zoomed in: caribbean, mediterranean and indo-australasian areas



in this context, using molecular markers is a powerful method for inferring the evolutionary history of the osprey. only two genetic studies have been carried out on this species  <cit> , but they did not investigate all subspecies, in the entire distributional range. here, we carried out an extensive phylogeographic study based on mitochondrial dna sequences  from samples covering the worldwide distribution of the osprey. this exhaustive dataset allowed addressing specific questions. a) does the osprey show any phylogeographic structure in mitochondrial dna at the continental level? b) how was such a specialized raptor able to colonize the entire world? we propose a hypothetical evolutionary scenario explaining how the species’ distribution and differentiation took place in the past. in the light of these new genetic clarifications, we discuss the potential implications for revisions of the taxonomy and for conservation  to design relevant conservation strategies at the appropriate spatial scale.

methods
sampling, dna sequencing and alignment
sampling covered the whole species’ distributional range, with  <dig> individuals  from  <dig> countries across five continents .

fresh samples  were obtained from wild ospreys at the nest during ringing activities in different breeding sites. for each individual, about  <dig>  ml of blood was taken by venepuncture from the wing and stored either on filter blotting papers or in 70 % ethanol in eppendorf tubes. in some cases, growing body feathers containing traces of blood within the calamus were collected and stored in envelopes.

for areas where it was not possible to collect fresh samples, we completed our sampling using  <dig> museum specimens. we collected small pieces of skin  from museum study osprey-skins following the procedure described by mundy et al.  <cit> . from each museum, we mainly choose museum study skins of various origins and collected during the breeding season, so excluding possible vagrants, wintering birds or dispersing animals.

from both fresh and museum specimens dna was extracted and amplified by pcr  for the mitochondrial cytochrome b  and nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> . for the cyt b, five sequences from the genbank database were also included, leading to a total of  <dig> sequences . for nd <dig> a subset of only  <dig> individuals returned high-quality pcr products to which we added one sequence from genbank, thus leading to a dataset of  <dig> individuals . finally, four other raptor species were used as outgroups: white-tailed eagle , tawny eagle , black-breasted buzzard  and gray-headed kite . the choice of these outgroups was motivated because 1) both cyt b and nd <dig> sequences were available in genbank , and 2) they represent four lineages of the accipitridae family, the sister taxa of pandionidae . the number of individuals and the length of sequences used for each analysis are reported in supplementary information .

total genomic dna was extracted from fresh and historical samples using a qiagen dneasy tissue kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions . to avoid contamination with contemporary dna  <cit> , all extractions from museum specimens were performed using the facilities of the platform “degraded dna”  dedicated to degraded dna experiments, where we adopted the following specific safety measures. equipment, consumables and qiagen dneasy tissue kits used in the platform were purchased new, while the room was regularly cleaned and exposed to uv overnight after each dna extraction cycle, in order to destroy possible traces of dna between successive extractions. experimentators wore protective clothing and footwear. as a further precaution and following bantock et al.  <cit> , we worked with a maximum of  <dig> samples during each series of extraction to reduce the risks of cross-contamination and possible handling errors with tubes. we only used half of each foot-skin sample  from which total dna was extracted. samples were incubated at least for one night at 56 °c to be digested during the lysis. the tissue was digested in 180 μl buffer atl/20 μl proteinase k solution for 20-h at 55 °c; other reagents and the spin column were used according to the manufacturer's instructions , and final dna elution was performed with 2 × 100 μl of 10 mm tris,  <dig>  mm hc <dig> ph  <dig>  preheated to 70 °c. multiple negative extraction and amplification controls were carried out simultaneously, using the same instruments and reagents, to detect possible contamination.

portions of the mitochondrial cyt b and nd <dig> were amplified by pcr. specific external and internal mitochondrial cyt b and nd <dig> primers were designed in this study for pandion haliaetus . pcr was performed using 1-μl  to 3-μl  of total dna extracted, 5-μl of the qiagen multiplex pcr kit , 1-μl for each primer at 2 pm and 2-μl of purified water. pcr reaction was performed using a mastercycler eppendorf thermocycler and began with an initial denaturation of 15 min at 95 °c, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 °c, 90 s annealing at 54 °c, 1 min extension at 72 °c and a 30 min final extension at 60 °c. a mitochondrial cytochrome b  <dig> nucleotides fragment was amplified with panhf <dig> and panhr <dig> primers; f <dig> and phnd2-r <dig> primers were used to amplify a nd <dig> nucleotide fragment of 1100 bp. in case of degraded dna, we used internal primers to amplify cyt b and nd <dig> in  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides overlapping fragments . screening of the pcr products was performed by running on a 1 % agarose gel using gelred tm nucleic acid gel stain . size products have been compared to long fragments ladder from eurogentec, smart laddertm. after band sizes were determined, pcr products were sequenced at the genoscope .

electrophoregrams were read using codoncode aligner  <dig> . <dig> software and sequences were aligned by eye using seaview  <dig> software  <cit> . sequences were also translated into amino acids to check for any stop codons and possible amplification of pseudo-genes. consensus sequences obtained for cyt b and nd <dig> from both fresh and museum samples were deposited in genbank under accession numbers given in additional file  <dig> 

partitioning and phylogenetic analyses
phylogenetic relationships were inferred from the cyt b alone or from the concatenated cyt b + nd <dig> datasets. we determined both the best-fit partitioning scheme and the best models of sequence evolution using partitionfinder  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using two probabilistic methods: bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood . bayesian analyses were performed with mrbayes  <dig>   <cit>  using the partitioning strategy obtained with partitionfinder . two separate runs of five million generations  were conducted simultaneously. tracer  <dig>   <cit>  was used to check the convergence between the two runs and to determine the burn-in period. on this basis, the first  <dig> phylogenetic trees were discarded , and the remaining  <dig> trees were used to estimate posterior parameters and probability distributions. ml tree was constructed with raxml  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . as gtr is the only nucleotide substitution model available in raxml, gtr + g was applied to all partitions previously determined by partitionfinder. the robustness of nodes was evaluated with  <dig> bootstrap replicates with the option –b. the consensus tree was obtained using the program consense of the phylip  <dig>  package  <cit> .

relationships between haplotypes were also visualized as a minimum spanning network, using the median-joining  network algorithm implemented in the program network  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . in order to avoid artefactual groupings due to missing data, the mj network was built considering the most complete dataset in terms of nucleotides and individuals, which is a fragment of 661 bp of the cyt b on  <dig> samples.

genetic diversity, demographic history and molecular dating
we used dnasp  <dig>   <cit>  to compute the number of haplotype , haplotype diversity , nucleotide diversity  as well as the average number of nucleotide differences . mean genetic distances within and between groups were computed using the p-distance and a pairwise deletion for the gaps/missing data treatment, as implemented in the mega  <dig>  software  <cit> .

demographic history of the haplogroups and the whole dataset was determined with different methods. firstly, r <dig>  <cit> , fu’s fs  <cit>  statistics and their significance were calculated with dnasp. ramos-onsins & rozas  <cit>  recommended using r <dig> when population sizes are small  and fs when sample sizes are large . the historical demography of main haplogroups was also estimated based on the cyt b dataset using the skyline plot method  separately with the cyt b partitioned according to codon position and using the hky + g model as sequence evolution. the likelihood-ratio test performed with tree-puzzle  <dig>   <cit>  rejected the strict molecular clock hypothesis . bsp analyses were thus conducted using a lognormal-relaxed molecular clock with a substitution rate of  <dig>  per lineage per million years as estimated by nabholz et al.  <cit>  for the osprey cytochrome b. although this rate has been obtained for the third codon position we apply it because most substitutions  are located at this position in our dataset. analyses were run for  <dig> million generations, sampled every  <dig> generations, after discarding the first 10 % as burn-in. we used tracer  <dig>  to analyse the results and draw the bsps.

time of the most recent common ancestor  was estimated with beast  <dig> . <dig> based on  <dig> sequences  of the cytochrome b . the whole alignment was partitioned according to the three codon positions using a hky + g model of sequence evolution. as previously, analyses were performed using a lognormal-relaxed molecular clock using a substitution rate  following a normal prior distribution of mean  <dig>   <cit>  and a standard deviation of  <dig>  to take into account some rate uncertainty. two runs were performed, each of  <dig> million generations, sampled every  <dig> generations, and a 10 % burn-in was applied. the resulting tree files were combined with logcombiner  <dig> . <dig> and the maximum clade credibility tree  was obtained with tree-annotator  <dig> . <dig> 

historical biogeography reconstruction
probabilistic inference of ancestral range was performed using biogeobears  <cit>  as implemented in r. we performed six different models  <cit> , to reconstruct the biogeographic history of osprey across continents. each analysis allows for a different subset of biogeographical possibilities, such as dispersal, vicariance and extinction . accordingly, we tested the following models: dispersal-extinction cladogenesis model , dispersal-vicariance analysis , bayesian inference of historical biogeography for discrete areas  and the same models including the founder-event speciation parameter , decj, divaj and bayareaj. finally, statistical fit of the six different models were compared using a model choice procedure by means of the akaike information criterion implemented in the r package biogeobears  <cit> .

as input tree, we used the ultrametric tree obtained from the mrbayes  analysis on the  <dig> haplotypes of the cyt b gene. we implemented a model including four broad geographic regions: america , indo-australasia , asia  and europe-africa . the maximal number of areas that could be occupied by one terminal grouping  was set to two. analyses were conducted using a non-time-stratified approach under default settings  <cit> . these six models have been tested in the frame of three different scenarios. the scenario “s0” corresponded to an unconstrained analysis without dispersal matrix. in addition, we tested two alternative biogeographic scenarios by implementing two different geodispersal matrices. in the scenario “s1” we tested a passage from america to indonesia-australia  and then towards asia and europe-africa areas in the rest of the palearctic, whereas in the scenario “s2” the matrix used stipulated a direct dispersal from america to the old world via the atlantic ocean, with a first colonisation of europe, then extending to asia and indonesia-australia .fig.  <dig> bayesian phylogenetic trees of ospreys constructed from: a  <dig> haplotypes of cytochrome b ; b the concatenated genes . in both trees, four species  were used as outgroups. branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site and \\ means that branches leading to outgroups have been reduced. for the four main clades the geographic origin of the samples is indicated by different colours and the number of haplotypes is given into parentheses. for supported clades, bayesian posterior probabilities and ml bootstrap are indicated at nodes, respectively



RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships
for the mitochondrial cyt b dataset , the best-fit scheme was a partitioning according to codon position with the models hky + i for position  <dig> , trn for position  <dig>  and k80 + g for position  <dig> . as the trn substitution model was not available in mrbayes, the parameter nst was set to  <dig>  the partitioned ml analysis was performed with  <dig> bootstrap replicates using a gtr + g substitution model for each codon position in raxml software. the average bayesian posterior probabilities  and bootstrap values  for supported clades are shown on the tree in fig.  <dig>  the phylogenetic tree including the totality of individuals  is reported in supplementary information .

comparisons on cyt b sequences of ospreys  returned  <dig> mtdna haplotypes that were used to represent phylogenetic relationships . this tree revealed the existence of four groups which represent quasi non-overlapping geographical lineages. a first clade  includes  <dig> haplotypes from  <dig> ospreys from the new world:  <dig> samples from the pacific coast of usa ,  <dig> from the atlantic coast of usa ,  <dig> from the caribbean and  <dig> of unknown origins . no genetic structure was evidenced and it can be noticed that caribbean samples  belong to two haplotypes which are scattered with other carolinensis samples .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic network of osprey based on  <dig> individuals and  <dig> pb of the cyt b. coloured pies chart indicate different haplotypes with size proportional to the number of individuals. within each clade, different colours have been used to show the origin of samples: within the eur-afr clade, orange is for north and central europe, whereas red is for mediterranean, atlantic islands and middle east areas; within the asia clade, blue is for siberia and pale blue for japan; within the ind-aus clade, dark and light green are for indonesia and australia, respectively; within the amer clade, violet is for north america and fuchsia for caribbean. haplotypes of particular interest  are indicated by dotted arrows. black dots represent missing haplotypes. the median vector is reported with a red dot. the number of individuals is indicated into parentheses for each group



the second cluster  is composed of  <dig> haplotypes including  <dig> individuals retrieved from the indo-australasian area:  <dig> from various islands of indonesia and  <dig> from australia.

a third group was composed of  <dig> haplotypes and  <dig> ospreys from asia :  <dig> from the pacific coast of siberia  and five from japan . in addition, two samples that belonged to this haplogroup were collected in other geographic areas: one from continental asia  and another one from the indo-australasian region .

finally, the largest clade  was formed by  <dig> individuals representing  <dig> haplotypes, mainly belonging to the western palearctic area, with a few exceptions.  <dig> of these samples were collected in europe along a latitudinal gradient scattered from northern europe , central europe , to southern localities in the mediterranean area . samples from north african coasts  and atlantic islands  were included in this haplogroup, together with ospreys from the red sea and persian gulf areas. three single haplotypes identified particular geographical regions : canary islands , persian gulf  and red sea . the remaining samples of the eur-afr group  mostly belonged to two frequent haplotypes. interestingly, three geographical exceptions were recorded in this group: two individuals from central siberia  and one from india.

in total, three potential mixing areas were detected between phylogenetic lineages in the old world : a) one in central siberia between eur-afr and asia; b) one in indonesia between asia and ind-aus and c) a third one between west indonesia and india between eur-afr and ind-aus.

despite the different sample sizes, mean genetic p-distances within groups  were low and showed comparable values , indicating limited genetic variability internal to each lineage. on the other hand, the greatest genetic differences between groups  were recorded between amer and eur-afr , whereas lowest values were obtained between ind-aus and asia  and between ind-aus and eur-afr . at the same time, distance between amer and ind-aus was smaller  than those between amer and asia .table  <dig> uncorrected pairwise -distance expressed as percentage  for cyt b within  and between clades in pandion haliaetus. the number of individuals analzed for each group is given into parentheses

relationships between the four haplogroups did not appear well resolved. the structure of the cyt b phylogenetic tree  revealed that the three old world lineages  formed a rather well supported grouping  leaving the amer group as the basal clade. on the other hand, the sister group relationships between eur-afr and asia is poorly supported . in order to improve resolution between groups we sequenced the nd <dig> gene for a subsample of  <dig> individuals . the concatenation of the two mitochondrial fragments represented 2037-bp and provided fourteen haplotypes from thirty-eight sequences . four partitions were obtained for the best-fit scheme: one for the position  <dig> of cyt b , one for the cyt b-position  <dig> and nd2-position  <dig> , one for the cyt b-position  <dig> and the nd2-position <dig>  and one for the nd2-position  <dig> . as previously stated, the trn model was approximated with nst =  <dig> in mrbayes. the analysis carried out on the two genes  reinforced the support for the four main lineages, although it should be noted that the asia group was now represented only by five samples from japan. even though the number of nucleotides has been doubled, the only noticeable gain is a slight increased support for the node eur-afr/asia  whereas other relationships, including the position of the root, remained unresolved.

network, genetic variability and demography
the cyt b network  confirmed that four major groups which were included in  <dig> unique mtdna haplotypes. the eur-afr clade  resulted in nine haplotypes differing by only one nucleotide change. two out of the nine haplotypes were most frequent, and shared by the majority of the individuals . despite remarkable differences in breeding and movement ecology, osprey populations of lower latitudes within the eur-afr did not show notable haplotypic differences when compared to the northern and central european birds. the four samples from the canary islands shared a single haplotype . within the ind-aus group  only three haplotypes were found, differing by only one nucleotide position. five haplotypes were observed within the amer group and  <dig> samples out of  <dig> showed the same haplotype, which was shared by ospreys from both western and eastern usa and from the caribbean. finally, within the asia group  two haplotypes were recorded. the five samples from japan were characterized by a single haplotype, which was shared with  <dig> samples from east siberia.

despite slight variation within each group , a larger number of nucleotide differences were recorded between clades. the amer group recorded the greatest genetic distance with eur-afr , whereas the minimum number of changes is  <dig> positions between ind-aus and asia .

in the subset of  <dig> ospreys,  <dig> polymorphic segregating sites were discovered within the 661 bp cyt b fragment. the haplotype diversity , nucleotide diversity  and other statistics were computed for the four recognized haplogroups and the whole dataset combined . haplotype diversity was higher in the largest group of eur-afr  and lower for the three other groups . the nucleotide diversity showed similar patterns between groups, being very weak in each lineage . overall, h was  <dig>  and π was  <dig>  for all pandion samples. demographic history of the four phylogroups, as inferred on the basis of fu’s fs and r <dig> statistics , indicate that only the amer group yielded very significant values for both indices, whereas the eur-afr lineage showed a significant value for the fu’s fs only. thus, population expansion can be assumed for the american and possibly for the western palearctic groups. by comparison, bayesian skyline plots  indicated that the two haplogroups amer and ind-aus remained demographically stable whereas the eur-afr haplogroup showed a trend of demographic expansion starting > <dig>  years ago. conversely, the asia haplogroup was the only one showing a pattern of demographic decline although demographic stability cannot likely be ruled out .table  <dig> estimates of across and within-population variability of cyt b sequences of osprey mtdna

molecular dating and biogeographical inference
diversification for each of the four groups was dated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma, that is during the upper pleistocene. among the four lineages, the initial split that individualized the amer group occurred about  <dig>  ma in the early pleistocene . subsequent events concerned firstly the divergence of the ind-aus group at  <dig>  ma whereas the last divergence event that generated the asia and eur-afr clades occurred at about  <dig>  ma. these two last events can be considered as nearly concomitant considering the large overlapping of the divergence dates .fig.  <dig> chronogram obtained with beast  <dig> . <dig> showing the time of divergence for the diverse splits in pandion haliaetus using a substitution rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  per lineage per million years. values between brackets at nodes indicate 95 % highest posterior densities. the colour code used for each haplogroup is the same as in previous figures. a partial geological time scale is reported below the chronogram 



among the six models tested in biogeographic inference, the ancestral area reconstruction method using the likelihood dispersal-vicariance analysis with the founder parameter  had a higher probability of being the best model for each of the three scenarios tested . with this model, the proposed scenario “s1” returned the best likelihood values. the “j” parameter for founder-event significantly increased the likelihood of the model  because “j” was estimated to be greater than zero  whereas the estimated rate of both dispersal and extinction was essentially zero . the ancestral reconstruction  thus favoured the scenario in which the radiation of pandion started from america and expanded towards the old world with subsequent founder events ; the ancestor  first diversified in the indo-australasian area by vicariance and then underwent a range expansion to occupy the eastern asia  and western palearctic .table  <dig> comparison of the six biogeographical reconstruction models for three different scenarios

discussion
species diversity and demography
our study revealed that the osprey is structured into four main genetic groups, representing quasi non-overlapping geographical regions. each lineage, though including birds from distant geographic areas, showed low internal genetic variability as revealed by the very low values  observed for the mean intra-group genetic distances. haplotypic and nucleotide diversities were also weak, with only  <dig> haplotypes observed for the largest group including  <dig> ospreys , and values were even smaller for the other three lineages . the two most common haplotypes in the clade eur-afr showed high overlap in ranges . a marked geographic substructuring was recorded only for individuals of the canary islands, red sea and persian gulf areas, each one representing a single haplotype .

despite the low variation within each group, the network  revealed a high number of nucleotide differences between the four distinct clades. overall, the mean sequence divergence across all populations  is  <dig>  %, which is higher than the values recorded for the red kite milvus milvus . the mean genetic distance between groups  is comparable to, or even greater than, those observed for the mitochondrial cyt b in several members of closely related sister eagle species from the genera aquila, hieraaetus  and haliaeetus .

populations within each group were poorly differentiated, suggesting that they might have experienced a reduction of genetic variation. such low values are usually related to populations that experienced demographic crashes or remained isolated in fragmented habitats  <cit> . however, the historical demographic reconstruction for each lineage suggested that they did not experience any strong bottleneck phases , but rather underwent stable trends or slight increases.

for the eur-afr clade, bayesian skyline curves  suggest that populations encountered a recent expansion, which probably started about  <dig>  years ago. this fits well with a recent review of the holocene fossils of osprey in central europe from  <dig>  years bp  <cit> . in europe, the osprey expanded its distribution area in the following centuries until the beginning of the 20th century. then, despite declines during the 1960-70s, populations were able to recover, showing positive demographic trends in most areas  <cit> . on the other hand, the asia clade seems to be the only one that potentially suffered some demographic decline . the same trend is also suggested by very low nucleotide diversity and a positive fs value. however, such values might also be related to the small sample size of this group . this result needs hence to be confirmed by further analyses with more extensive sampling from east asia.

why then does each clade show such low genetic variability? low levels of genetic variation can be the consequence of recent population declines, or represent an ancestral condition, inherited from an ancient evolutionary history  <cit> . to bring support to these two hypotheses, we compared haplotype diversity between museum and fresh specimens among the eur-afr group . we found that for  <dig> oldest museum specimens , most haplotypes  are also represented in the fresh samples, thus suggesting that there has been no recent loss of haplotypic diversity. several studies have also reported stable genetic diversity despite declines in population size . for example, no obvious loss of genetic diversity was detected among canadian peregrine falcons  despite a population bottleneck in the 20th century  <cit> . in our case, one possible explanation is the colonization of new areas by few individuals carrying only a few mitochondrial lineages from the genetic pool . furthermore, source populations could have experienced a reduction in genetic variability due to climate fluctuations during the quaternary; remnant populations in refugia represented the genetic source for the following recolonization .

phylogenetic inferences
the cyt b phylogenetic tree  suggests that the amer haplogroup constitutes the first genetic group that emerged among the four groups evidenced for pandion haliaetus. this relationship is more supported by the cyt b alone  than by the nd <dig> alone . moreover, the combination of cyt b and nd <dig>  did not increase markedly the resolution, thus suggesting that the divergence of the four major clades occurred over a relatively short time period. another explanation could be that irresolution arose as a misplacement of the root of the tree due to the use of too divergent outgroups. indeed, there are no optimal outgroups available for the phylogeny rooting of pandion, since it constitutes a long branch in the phylogeny of raptors, distant from its sister accipitridae family  <cit> . in preliminary analyses we also included other outgroups such as sagittarius serpentarius and/or different species from the cathartidae family, but no evident improvements in branching were recorded. similar problems of rooting have been reported in other phylogeography studies  <cit> .

nevertheless, other arguments can be advocated to reinforce the hypothesis that the osprey originated in the new world . first, the oldest recognized osprey specimen is a pandion homalopteron of the mid-miocene of california dated at 13 ma  <cit> . this is in accordance with our molecular dating which estimated at ca.  <dig>  ma  the origin of a first ancestor for pandion sp . in addition, as far as we know no fossil was found in australia , whereas seven fossils from late pleistocene have been found in florida  <cit> . second, calculation of the p-distances between groups  indicates that the amer group is the most divergent compared to the other three groups, suggesting its more ancient origin . our molecular dating estimated at  <dig>  ma  the diversification of pandion haliaetus. further, the phylogenetic trees  did not support a sister group relationship between amer and eur-afr, as it would be expected in the case of a direct colonization from america to europe . on the contrary, a pronounced phylogenetically old separation between american and western palearctic populations emerged, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> geographical distribution of the four haplogroups of pandion haliaetus. symbols and colours indicate both sample locations and genetic group: violet squares for amer, orange circles for eur-afr, blue stars for asia and green triangles for ind-aus . numbers with their corresponding arrows describe the different phases of the hypothetical colonization scenario



biogeographic inferences
the major result yielded by phylogeographic inferences is a split of pandion in four clades that appear to have diverged from each other within relatively short time. because of the uncertainty with regard to the relative branching order of these clades , patterns of colonization phases should be considered as tentative.

the best biogeographical scenario supports america as the most likely area of origin of pandion . the selected model  favours an expansion of osprey populations that underwent diversification by subsequent founder events followed by vicariance processes. synthetically, from america, osprey should have colonized the indo-australasian region passing through the pacific coast of asia . from refugia located in indonesia-oceania, rapid range expansion allowed the settlement in eastern asia and the western palearctic . as a supporting case, cyt b data suggest that japan was likely colonized after russia and not directly from australia. such a scenario would explain the current distribution of pandion across all continents and the genetic divergence found among the four lineages. this hypothesis is corroborated by the p-distances which displayed lower values between amer and ind-aus  than those recorded between amer and eur-afr . this result indicates that the eur-afr group did not originate directly from the amer group, as also suggested by the lowest likelihood values yielded by the alternative biogeographical reconstruction .

implications for taxonomy and conservation
the four genetic groups that we found do not entirely correspond to the four subspecies described, based on morphological characters  <cit> . the ind-aus lineage fully matched geographically with the subspecies cristatus  <cit> . contrary to current taxonomy, north american carolinensis ospreys did not differ from caribbean ridgwayi birds as there is no evident structure in the phylogeographic tree and in the network. on the other hand, in eurasia, we discovered that the subspecies haliaetus was actually composed of  <dig> lineages  that are undistinguishable morphologically. this reflects the poor knowledge of the species in asia where detailed information about biology and distribution are needed  <cit> . more samples should be collected to clarify the geographical limits of these lineages, especially in the regions where we found a zone of overlap .

overall, genetic distances between osprey clades  are in a range which has already been used by taxonomists for designating distinct raptor species . however, we detected a relatively low overall nucleotide diversity  compared to other large raptor species with a similar wide distribution . it might be objected that more variability would potentially have been found by including more geographic samples for the different clades. however, if we consider the eur-afr clade , the variability was as weak as for other groups that are represented by a much smaller number of birds . the decision for splitting ospreys into different species  should integrate also other factors besides morphology and mtdna differences; e.g. nuclear genes and behavioural aspects, including migrations that could play an important role as reproductive barriers between distant populations  <cit> .

a first step towards a sound global management and conservation plan is to define management units  and evolutionary significant units . as a matter of fact, subspecies have often been used as proxies for units of conservation in absence of a genetic data indicating distinct evolutionary units  <cit> . our results evidenced four different lineages that may deserve the status of esus for specific management actions. a better knowledge of the distribution range of each lineage is strongly needed in the near future. in particular, the asia lineage should be a priority target for multiple reasons: 1) this lineage has never been described before; 2) it relied on a limited number of samples  from only a few areas; 3) the majority of the samples analysed were museums specimens, so the current presence of this lineage in east russia and indonesia needs to be confirmed; 4) it is the only one clade showing signals of demographic decline; and 5) no clear morphological characteristics can presently help identification.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that, at the global scale, the particular evolutionary history of the osprey has partitioned the species into  <dig> distinct clades with clear genetic differentiation. in addition, our findings indicate that broad habitat requirements and high mobility of osprey were more important factors than philopatry in shaping genetic diversity at the intra-clade level. further genetic study using microsatellite markers are ongoing  in order to reveal more recent differences and to quantify gene flow among populations that show differences in migratory or reproductive behaviours .

even though the osprey is currently globally listed as “least concern” according to iucn criterions  <cit> , it is considered a priority species for conservation across its distributional range. indeed, the osprey is taxonomically unique and conserving its phylogenetic diversity should be a priority . the species experienced a severe decline during the 19th and 20th century that led to significant demographic declines and local extinctions . consequently, the osprey has emerged as an important flagship species and during recent decades has been involved in  <dig> reintroduction projects in the usa  <cit>  and in europe  <cit> . our results suggest that future reintroduction projects should be conducted using source populations from the same lineage . however, before concluding that no restriction needs to be adopted for translocations between populations within the western palearctic, other ecological, demographical or behavioural variables should be considered.

ethics statement
a specific ethical committee was not required for this study. bird handling was performed under animal experimentation permits 34– <dig>  delivered by the french ‘direction départementale de la protection des populations’ and under the licence of olivier duriez from the centre for bird population studies  of the natural history museum : according to the french law of  <dig> september  <dig>  the crbpo has the delegation by the ministry of ecology, energy, sustainable development and land settlement for allowing the owners of a general bird ringing licence to capture and handle birds from protected species, and collect samples or mark them .
