BACKGROUND
hookworms  are blood-feeding nematodes that inhabit the small intestines of their mammalian host. species of ancylostoma, necator, bunostomum and globocephalus, for instance, are of major human or animal health significance in various countries  <cit> . the infective, third-stage larvae  can be ingested or penetrate the skin of the host and migrate via the circulatory system and the lungs to finally reside, as dioecious adults, usually in the duodenum. the adults attach via their buccal capsule to the intestinal mucosa, rupture capillaries and feed on blood. the pathogenesis of hookworm disease in humans and other animals is mainly a consequence of the blood loss, which occurs during parasite attachment and feeding in the intestine. cutaneous infection can occur and is often associated with inflammatory/immune responses and painful, eruptive lesions during the migration of larvae through the skin  <cit> .

current estimates indicate that more than  <dig> million people are infected with the hookworms ancylostoma duodenale and necator americanus  <cit> , and ~ <dig> million are severely clinically affected by hookworm disease  <cit> . in a large number of developing countries, hookworms are a leading cause of iron deficiency anaemia, which, in heavy infections, can cause physical and mental retardation and deaths in children as well as adverse maternal-foetal outcomes  <cit> . although there is considerably less information on the prevalence and geographical distribution of hookworms of animals  <cit> , these parasites are also clinically important in dogs , cats , ruminants , pigs  and other hosts  <cit> . hookworms were originally thought to be host-specific  <cit> ; however, the canine hookworm, ancylostoma caninum, for example, can infect humans and cause dermatitis and eosinophilic enteritis  <cit> , and some hookworm species, such as the bovine hookworm, bunostomum phlebotomum, have been linked to cutaneous lesions in humans  <cit> . significant genetic variation has been described among individuals of ancylostoma caninum from dogs in australia  <cit> . such variation might reflect differences in host specificity, infectivity and/or pathogenicity among individual nematodes within a population or, in some cases, might be indicative of speciation events, as has been hypothesized previously for human hookworms  <cit> . presently, there are no published studies of genetic variation within and among populations of bunostomum phlebotomum and no molecular data are publicly available for this species.

the ability to accurately identify hookworms to species and to assess genetic variability in hookworm populations is central to studying their epidemiology as well as to diagnosis and control. sequences of the first and second internal transcribed spacers  of nuclear ribosomal dna   <cit>  and of camp-dependent protein kinase  <cit>  have been utilized to identify and differentiate hookworm species. however, the its- <dig> and its- <dig> regions do not usually display sufficient within-species sequence variability to enable the study of the genetic structuring within and among hookworm populations  <cit> . in contrast, mitochondrial  genomes have been shown to contain useful genetic markers for studying the population structures of hookworm species  <cit> , because of their rapid mutation rates and apparent maternal inheritance  <cit> . although the protein-coding mt gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig>  is applicable to population studies of a range of invertebrates, including parasitic platyhelminths  <cit>  and some nematodes  <cit> , there are still limited sequence data for cox <dig> and other mt genes of hookworms, and limited published information is available on sequence heterogeneity therein. building on advances in long polymerase chain reaction -based mt genome sequencing  <cit> , the present study determined the sequences and structures of the two mt genomes from an individual of ancylostoma caninum  from australia and a specimen of bunostomum phlebotomum  from south africa. the sequences derived for the mt genomes of these two hookworms were compared in detail with mt genomic data available for the predominant hookworms of humans, ancylostoma duodenale and necator americanus  <cit> , as well as those available for other selected species belonging to the orders strongylida  <cit> , ascaridida  <cit>  and spirurida  <cit> .

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome features, characteristics and gene organization
the circular mt genomes of ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum, sequenced from single adult worms, were  <dig> and  <dig> bp in size, respectively . each genome contained  <dig> genes, including  <dig> protein coding genes ,  <dig> transfer rna  genes and  <dig> ribosomal rna genes , and was consistent with gene arrangement  <dig>   <cit> . this arrangement is characteristic for the mt genomes of all members of the strongylida and ascaridida, as well as the free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans , but not for strongyloides stercoralis   <cit> . in accordance with other species of strongylida for which complete mt genome sequences are available  <cit> , the at-rich regions for both ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum were located between the genes nad <dig> and nad <dig>  flanked at the 5'-end by the trna gene for alanine, and at the 3'-end by the trna genes for proline and alanine.

each protein-coding gene for each of the two species had an open reading frame , and all genes were located on the same strand and transcribed in the same direction , consistent with the known mt genomes of secernentean nematodes  <cit> . the nucleotide usages  of a, c, g and t in each mt genome were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, for ancylostoma caninum  and  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, for bunostomum phlebotomum , with overall a+t contents of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the a+t content of protein coding genes ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  for ancylostoma caninum, and from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  for bunostomum phlebotomum. the a+t content for rrns, rrnl  and the at-rich region were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, for ancylostoma caninum, and  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, for bunostomum phlebotomum. for the mt genome of ancylostoma caninum, codon usage in individual protein coding genes  ranged from 0% for cgc  and ccc  to  <dig> % for ttt . for the mt genome of bunostomum phlebotomum, codon usage ranged from 0% for cgc , cac , ctc , ccc , tcc  and gtc  to  <dig> % for ttt . for both species, individual trna structures were consistent with those predicted previously for hookworms and other secernentean nematodes  <cit> . all trna genes, except trns and trns, had a predicted secondary structure containing a tv-replacement loop instead of the tψc arm and loop . the predicted secondary structure of each of the two serine trnas contained the tψc arm and loop but lacked the dhu loop. the genes rrns and rrnl were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively; the predicted secondary structures for the ribosomal rna gene subunits for ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum  were similar to those of necator americanus and ancylostoma duodenale  <cit> , which is also supported by the high nucleotide sequence similarity in the mt genes among these four hookworms .

large and small ribosomal rna subunits, at-rich regions and complete mitochondrial genomes of ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum.

in addition: nucleotide sequences for each of the ribosomal rna genes of ancylostoma caninum  and bunostomum phlebotum  with those published for species of strongylida , species of ascaridida  and species of spirurida .

with those published for species of strongylida , species of ascaridida  and species of spirurida .

the at-rich regions for ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, and both exhibited complex secondary structures , as predicted previously for the at-rich regions of nematodes  <cit> . four at-repeat regions of variable length were identified in the at-rich region of the mt genome of ancylostoma caninum: two were  <dig> nucleotides  , one was  <dig> nt  and the longest was  <dig> nt . similar dinucleotide repeats have been described in the at-rich region of the mt genomes of other nematode species . other repetitive elements have been identified within this region in the free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans, the largest and most conspicuous of which are the repetitive sequence motifs cr1-cr <dig>  <cit> . however, no such elements were identified in the at-rich region of the mt genome of either ancylostoma caninum, bunostomum phlebotomum or any other species of animal-parasitic nematode sequenced to date  <cit> .

comparative analyses with other nematodes
the identities  in inferred amino acid sequences of each protein-coding mt gene were calculated based upon pairwise comparisons between ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum . based on these comparisons, the sequence identities  were cox <dig> , cox <dig> , nad4l , cox <dig> , cytb , atp <dig> , nad <dig> , nad <dig> , nad <dig> , nad <dig> , nad <dig>  and nad <dig> . in addition, the amino acid sequences inferred from each coding mt gene of ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum were compared, again in a pairwise manner, with those inferred from published mt genomes of anisakis simplex  <cit> , ascaris suum  <cit>  and toxocara canis  <cit>  , ancylostoma duodenale, necator americanus  <cit>  and haemonchus contortus  <cit>  , and brugia malayi  <cit> , dirofilaria immitis  <cit>  and onchocerca volvulus  <cit>  . the most conserved protein sequences among all species, assessed relative to ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum, were inferred to be cox <dig>  cox <dig> and nad4l, and the least conserved were nad <dig> and nad <dig> .

phylogenetic analyses of selected species of ascaridida, spirurida and strongylida using concatenated amino acid sequence data inferred from mt genes
because of the high degree of intraspecific variation in nucleotide sequence in the mt genes of nematodes  <cit>  and the limited availability or lack of multiple mt genome sequences for each species, previous work has suggested that phylogenetic analyses for nematodes be conducted using concatenated amino acid sequence datasets, utilizing sequences inferred from individual mt protein coding genes  <cit> . in order to further assess systematic relationships within and among members of the ascaridida, spirurida and strongylida, a phylogenetic analysis was carried out using bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood  . almost all clades in the consensus tree were supported by maximum bi posterior probability  values  and/or ml bootstrap support . the phylogenetic analysis conducted herein clearly supports the distinct classification of the orders ascaridida, spirurida and strongylida, each as monophyletic clades with maximum statistical support. the order rhabditida appears to be paraphyletic, with caenorhabditis elegans grouping closely with the strongylida, and steinernema carpocapsae and strongyloides stercoralis placed externally to a clade comprising the ascaridida, strongylida and c. elegans. this relationship is consistent with the proposed molecular phylogeny for the nematoda based on small subunit  nuclear ribosomal dna data  <cit> . in addition, the hookworms were represented as a monophyletic clade within the strongylida.

for hookworms, the phylogenetic analysis using bi indicated a closer relationship between ancylostoma spp. and necator americanus than between either of them and bunostomum phlebotomum. this finding conflicts with the current classification of the strongylida  <cit> , wherein both necator and bunostomum are placed within the subfamily bunostominae, whereas ancylostoma is placed within the subfamily ancylostominae . a larger analysis, including mt data for more hookworm species, is needed to test further this hypothesis.

the present phylogenetic analysis did not support the grouping of the ascaridida and spirurida to the exclusion of the strongylida, which contrasts markedly the results of a previous study based on nuclear ribosomal gene data . the "common heritage" hypothesized herein for the ascaridida and strongylida to the exclusion of the spirurida has been supported by previous studies using mt gene order data  <cit>  and using concatenated amino acid sequence data inferred from protein-coding mt genes  <cit> . these findings stimulate further study of the evolutionary relationships among taxa within this phylum using mt datasets. the high-throughput sequencing potential of  <dig> technology  <cit>  and the recent validation of this technique for the sequencing of mt genomes  <cit>  should provide a platform for an in-depth analysis of the phylogeny of the nematoda.

CONCLUSIONS
utility of mt gene markers for population genetic, ecological and epidemiological studies of hookworms
although some nuclear genetic regions  have been shown to be suitable for the specific identification and differentiation of hookworms, the nuclear loci examined to date do not usually display sufficient levels of intraspecific sequence variability for the investigation of the genetic structures of hookworm populations . the ability to estimate genetic variability within and among hookworm populations is central to studying their epidemiology and population genetics, and can have important practical implications in relation to control.

sequence-based analyses  of protein-coding mt genes, such as cox <dig> and nad <dig>  have been particularly useful or population genetic studies  <cit> . for example, hu et al.  <cit>  employed a single-strand conformation polymorphism -coupled sequencing approach to explore haplotypic variability within a limited number of ancylostoma caninum specimens from australia and each of the human hookworms . significant population sub-structuring was recorded within each of these three species, and two genetically distinct subpopulations were detected within ancylostoma caninum from dogs from townsville, australia. previous morphological and clinical studies had shown that ancylostoma caninum in townsville  is not specific to dogs and can also infect humans , causing eosinophilic enteritis  <cit> . it has been speculated  <cit>  that particular, genetically distinct subpopulations within ancylostoma caninum can selectively infect the non-canine host. the pattern of haplotypic variability within ancylostoma caninum might be due to secondary contact between populations or subpopulations, which could have arisen due to host movement from other geographical areas where this hookworm has been recorded and where ecological conditions are distinct; for example, ancylostoma caninum is endemic in tropical north-east queensland, australia  <cit> , but also occurs in the north-west area of western australia  <cit> . it is also possible that feral dogs or dingoes  might harbour one or more genetic variants which might "spill-over" into domestic dogs and/or humans  <cit> . future study of the genetic variation among ancylostoma caninum specimens from domestic and feral dogs, cats and humans as well as between populations from other geographical and climatic regions in australia and south-east asia would allow such questions to be addressed. a comparison of the genetic make-up of ancylostoma caninum from humans affected by eosinophilic enteritis with those from domestic dogs in the townsville area would be particularly interesting.

in contrast to ancylostoma caninum, no studies have yet explored the genetics or molecular epidemiology of bunostomum phlebotomum. mitochondrial markers might be used to examine sub-structuring in bunostomum phlebotomum populations in endemic regions of south africa. in addition, although there has been anecdotal evidence suggesting that bunostomum phlebotomum may cause cutaneous larval migrans in humans , the zoonotic potential of this species of hookworm has not yet been tested molecularly. in view of the lack of distinguishing morphological characters allowing the identification of individual larvae, the provision of molecular markers for bunostomum phlebotomum might allow the extent of the zoonotic potential of this species to be assessed for the first time.

the two mt genomes characterized herein provide a solid foundation for studies of the epidemiology, ecology and population genetics of both ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum, which could have important implications for the control of infections by these parasites. given the lack of morphological characters for specific identification and differentiation of hookworm larvae, there is a clear need for species and population genetic markers for in-depth exploration of the epidemiology of hookworms  <cit> . combined with the use of specific markers in the internal transcribed spacers  of nuclear rdna  <cit> , investigating the mt haplotypic variability in populations of ancylostoma caninum and bunostomum phlebotomum  could provide important insights into host affiliations, gene flow and transmission patterns  and thus assist in the control of these hookworms. furthermore, the direct sequencing of the mt genome of ancylostoma caninum by  <dig> technology is the second example of the use of this approach for the sequencing of mt genomes of nematodes  <cit>  and re-enforces the exciting potential of emerging technologies for the high-throughput sequencing of relatively small organellar genomes.
