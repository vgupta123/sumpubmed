BACKGROUND
mortality induced by sepsis is highly associated with secondary acute lung injury. systemic inflammation during sepsis leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome  caused by an exacerbated response of the immune system to bacteria and their products . indeed, mice subjected to experimental model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture  show deregulation in pulmonary immune response, marked by cytokine storm and intense accumulation of activated leukocytes in lung tissue, including t lymphocytes .

γδ t lymphocytes are unconventional lymphocytes that have antigen recognition properties fundamentally different from those of αβ t lymphocytes, and are comprised by distinct functional subsets, defined by the differential usage of vγ and vδ gene repertoire  <cit> . the vγ <dig> t lymphocyte subset is highly associated with lung immune surveillance and increases in number in mouse lungs at early time points during bacterial infections . increased migration of γδ t cells into the lungs has been previously demonstrated during experimental sepsis; however, the identification of γδ t cell subtypes has not been previously described  <cit> .

the migration of γδ t lymphocytes is largely dictated by the activation of chemokine receptors by their counterpart ligands, among which members from both cc and cxc subfamilies play compelling roles . once at the infection site, these cells can rapidly respond to microbial antigens via innate surface receptors , producing high amounts of interferon -γ and interleukin - <dig>  which are signature cytokines produced by specific subsets of γδ t cells . vγ <dig> t lymphocytes represent one of the major subsets that produce il- <dig> in different experimental models .

γδ t lymphocytes have been shown to play divergent roles in mouse models of sepsis . the protective role of γδ t lymphocytes during experimental sepsis has been attributed to the production of il- <dig>  a cytokine that triggers neutrophil recruitment and improves bacterial clearance . furthermore, the accumulation of activated γδ t lymphocytes in the lungs of clp mice has been correlated with beneficial outcome of septic mice  <cit> . here we show that during the course of experimental severe sepsis, vγ <dig> t lymphocytes migrate into injured lungs of clp mice and exert a protective role via the production of il- <dig> 

RESULTS
activated γδ t lymphocytes accumulate in mouse lungs during severe sepsis
the induction of severe sepsis triggered an intense inflammatory response in mouse lungs, marked by a significant increase of γδ and αβ t lymphocyte numbers observed from  <dig> to 10 days after the surgery . the γδ t cell subtype vγ <dig> also infiltrated into the lungs of clp-induced mice and, differently from those of αβ and γδ t lymphocytes, did not decrease in numbers at day  <dig> post-surgery. both γδ and αβ t lymphocyte numbers were decreased in mouse spleen from 1– <dig> days after clp, returning to control  levels within 10 days , suggesting that t cells found in the lungs egress from secondary lymphoid organs.fig.  <dig> γδ t lymphocytes accumulate in mouse lungs and spleen after clp. γδ, vγ <dig> and αβ t lymphocyte numbers in c57bl/ <dig> mouse lungs  and spleen   <dig>   <dig> and 10 days after clp. results are expressed as mean ± sem from at least five animals per group out of three different experiments. statistical differences between the clp and sham group  are indicated by . the gates were set according to igg isotype staining



the analysis of activation marker expression revealed that the presence of cd25+ t lymphocytes in the lungs and spleen of clp mice was more expressive among γδ rather than among αβ t cell population. the percentages of γδ  t lymphocytes expressing cd <dig> were increased in the lungs of clp mice at day  <dig> post clp and persisted elevated until 10 days after surgery, when the number of αβ t lymphocyte also increased . in spleens, γδ and vγ <dig> t lymphocytes were constantly activated during the course of experimental severe sepsis, whereas cd25+ αβ t lymphocytes were only elevated at day  <dig> after clp .fig.  <dig> activated γδ t lymphocytes accumulate in mouse lungs and spleen after clp. percentages of cd25+ cells among γδ, vγ <dig> and αβ t lymphocyte populations recovered from mouse lungs  and spleen   <dig>   <dig> and 10 days after clp. results are expressed as mean ± sem from at least five animals per group out of three different experiments. statistical differences between the clp and sham group  are indicated by . the gates were set according to igg isotype staining

ten days after surgery, cfse+ γδ  t cells adoptively transferred from naïve mice were preferentially localized in the lungs of clp-operated mice, when compared to blood and spleen . in accordance, increased levels of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> were detected in lung homogenates of clp-operated mice, when compared to chemokine levels detected in naïve and sham mouse lung samples . no differences were observed in ccl <dig> levels between clp- and sham-operated mice . γδ t lymphocytes migrated in vitro towards lung homogenates obtained from clp mice at a higher extent than towards lung homogenates from naïve or sham-operated mice. the in vitro neutralization of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> by mabs inhibited γδ t lymphocyte chemotaxis towards the respective chemokines and lung homogenates obtained from clp mice, suggesting that these chemokines coordinate γδ t cell in vivo migration into the lungs during severe sepsis .fig.  <dig> γδ t lymphocytes migrate from spleen into the lungs of clp-operated recipient mice. t lymphocytes recovered from the spleen of naïve mice were labeled with cfse and transferred to clp-operated mice  <dig> and 8 days after surgery. recipient animals were euthanized 10 days after surgery, and their lungs, blood and spleen were collected for γδ  and αβ  t cell analysis by flow cytometry. quantification of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> levels in lung homogenates of naïve, sham and clp c57bl/ <dig> mice by elisa, 7 days after surgery . γδ t cell chemotaxis towards lung homogenates from clp mice , incubated or not with neutralizing α-ccl <dig>  α-ccl <dig> or α-ccl <dig>  as described in methods . representative results of two experiments from at least  <dig> animals per experimental group are expressed as mean ± sem. statistical differences  between clp and sham groups are indicated by , and between stimulated and mab-treated groups are indicated by 



γδ t lymphocytes from the lungs of clp-operated mice produce il-17
ten days after surgery, intracellular staining revealed that the percentage of il-17+ γδ t lymphocytes increased among total cd3+ cell population in the lungs of clp mice, while the percentage of il-17+ αβ t lymphocytes decreased after clp, when compared to sham-operated mice . evaluation of γδ t cell cytokine profile revealed a slight decrease in il-10+ and ifn-γ+ γδ t lymphocytes in clp mouse lungs, whereas no differences between il-4+, il-12+ or tumor necrosis factor -α+ γδ t lymphocytes were detected between clp and sham mice . it is noteworthy that the percentage of il-17+  γδ t lymphocytes increased upon in vitro restimulation with α-cd <dig> mab . representative dot plots show that il- <dig> positive staining was detected among γδ+ and vγ4+, but not among the vγ1+ lymphocyte subtype recovered from the lungs of clp mice . il- <dig> production by γδ t cells is restricted to cd27- cells. accordingly, our data demonstrate that the percentage of cd27- lymphocytes increased among vγ4+, but not among the vγ1+ lymphocytes in the spleen 3 days after clp . to evaluate the implication of vγ <dig> t lymphocytes in il- <dig> production during sepsis, mice were treated with anti-vγ <dig> mab 1 day before clp. figure 4e shows that anti-vγ <dig> mab treatment decreased il- <dig> production in clp mouse lungs 7 days after surgery, in a similar extent as γδ t lymphocytes.fig.  <dig> increased il- <dig> production by vγ <dig> t lymphocytes in clp mouse lungs. a percentages of γδ and αβ t lymphocytes among lung il-17+ t cells recovered 10 days after clp, as determined by intracellular staining. b representative dot plots of intracellular staining of il-17+ within γδ, vγ <dig> and vγ <dig> t cells recovered from the lungs of clp mice. c percentages of cd27- cells among γδ, vγ <dig> and vγ <dig> t cell population in the spleen recovered 3 days after clp. d representative histograms of cd <dig> staining of γδ, vγ <dig> and vγ <dig> t cells recovered from mouse spleen. e il- <dig> quantification in lung homogenates of clp mice treated or not with α-γδ tcr mab, α-vγ <dig> tcr mab or control igg, 7 days after surgery was performed by cba. results are expressed as mean ± sem from at least  <dig> animals per group. statistical differences  between clp and sham groups are indicated by , and between stimulated and mab-treated groups are indicated by 



anti-vγ <dig> tcr mab treatment decreases survival rate in c57bl/ <dig> mice subjected to severe sepsis
approximately 50 % of c57bl/ <dig> mice subjected to the experimental model of severe sepsis and antibiotic treatment died within 7 days . anti-vγ <dig> mab treated mice that underwent clp died in shorter periods of time, achieving 30 % of survival rate within 7 days. worthy of note, anti-γδ mab treatment similarly precipitated clp mouse death, suggesting that vγ <dig> t cell subset presents a protective role in septic mice. igg isotype-treated mice showed similar survival rate than untreated mice. figure 5b and additional file 2: figure s2a–b show the effectiveness of depletion by mab administration in spleen and lungs.fig.  <dig> anti-vγ <dig> mab treatment decreases survival rate of septic mice. a survival rate was analyzed in clp mice treated or not with α-γδ tcr mab, α-vγ <dig> tcr mab or igg up to 7 days after clp surgery. the results are expressed as percentage of survival rate per day, from  <dig> mice per group. b representative dot plots of γδ and vγ4+ t cell frequency in spleen and lungs of treated mice, analyzed by flow cytometry



discussion
sepsis triggers a complex immune response that involves both innate and adaptive systems. γδ t lymphocytes represent a link between these two branches of the immune system, by coordinating the activation of different cell populations via cytokine production  <cit> . γδ t lymphocytes have been described as a major source of il- <dig> in peritoneum and lymphoid organs during experimental sepsis, a phenomenon shown to present either beneficial or deleterious effects, depending on the experimental model . the data presented here identifies the vγ <dig> subset as a dominant producer of il- <dig> in the lungs of septic mice and as a central t cell population involved in host defense against sepsis.

the experimental model of severe sepsis used in the present work resulted in the accumulation of t lymphocytes in lung tissue, which were likely originated from lymphoid organs. increased numbers of both γδ and αβ t lymphocyte subsets were detected in the lungs; however it is noteworthy that, differently from αβ t lymphocytes, γδ t cell numbers continually increased up to day  <dig> after clp, mainly due to the accumulation of vγ <dig> subset. the progressive accumulation of γδ t cells in the lungs of clp-operated mice has been previously demonstrated by hirsh and coworkers  <cit> ; however, the presence of γδ t cell subtypes has not been described. the decrease in αβ t cell numbers observed at day  <dig> after clp is in accordance with several reports in mice and humans that demonstrate a reduction in circulating cd3+ t lymphocytes during sepsis  <cit> . this reduction is explained by a massive apoptotic event of t lymphocytes, which is correlated with severity and mortality in experimental animals and patients . the fact that the percentage of cd25+ t lymphocytes increased among γδ t lymphocytes in the lungs at early time points after clp  suggests that γδ  t lymphocytes are constantly activated in lymphoid tissues during the course of sepsis and continuously migrate towards inflamed lungs. in accordance with our data, matsushima and co-workers  <cit>  demonstrated the early activation of γδ t lymphocytes from peripheral blood of patients with sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. these patients presented increased percentages of peripheral cd69+ γδ t cells at acute time points after injuries, whereas cd <dig> expression by αβ t cells did not increase during a 2-week period  <cit> . it is noteworthy that, in our study, such early activation was also evident for vγ <dig> t cell population, as observed in mouse spleen and lungs 1 day after clp.

the selective migration of γδ t lymphocyte subsets into the tissue during inflammation is dictated by elevated levels of chemoattractant mediators in the tissue and by the expression pattern of chemokine receptors on cell surface  <cit> . our results suggest that γδ and vγ <dig> t cell migration into the lungs of clp mice is likely accounted by the combined in situ accumulation of multiple chemokines. clp-induced lung inflammation increased tissue levels of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  chemokines that are known to mediate γδ t lymphocyte migration in vivo and in vitro . consistently, here we show that adoptively transferred γδ t cells preferentially accumulated in the lungs  of recipient clp mice. even though ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> are also chemoattractant for αβ t lymphocytes  <cit> , the neutralization of these chemokines in clp lung homogenates did not impair the chemotaxis of γδ- t lymphocytes , suggesting that these chemokines selectively dictate the migration of γδ t cells into the lungs in our model. the involvement of ccl <dig> in γδ t cell migration towards inflamed lungs during sepsis was also investigated by us, since ccl <dig> has been shown to attract il-17+ γδ t cells into inflamed airways  <cit> . however, ccl <dig> was not enhanced in clp mouse lungs .

our data demonstrate that the vγ <dig> t lymphocyte subset predominated among the il-17+ cell populations in clp mouse lungs. in line with this, it has been demonstrated that mice lacking γδ t cells  subjected to clp failed to present elevated il- <dig> levels in the plasma and peritoneal lavage, showing that γδ t cells are the major producers of il- <dig> during experimental sepsis . it has been established that, among murine γδ t lymphocytes, il- <dig> production is restricted to vγ <dig> and vγ <dig> subtypes  <cit> . consistently with our data, vγ <dig> t lymphocytes comprise the major subset that migrates into the lungs and have been shown to produce il- <dig> in different experimental models . it is noteworthy that our supplemental data  demonstrate that il- <dig> production by γδ t cells from clp-mouse lungs predominated over the expression of other cytokines, including ifn-γ. these data are reinforced by the increase in the percentage of cd27- γδ+  population in clp-mouse spleen and by the fact that, upon α-cd <dig> mab in vitro stimulation, these cells were enriched for il- <dig> but not for ifn-γ .

increased numbers of γδ t lymphocytes in the blood, peritoneum and lungs have been correlated with sepsis positive outcome in patients and experimental animals  <cit> . indeed, mice lacking γδ t lymphocytes and subjected to clp presented increased mortality rate and decreased survival periods  <cit> . the protective role of γδ t lymphocytes during sepsis results from the ability of these cells to produce inflammatory mediators capable to modulate other leukocyte populations, among which il- <dig> is of particular importance  <cit> . here we show that il- <dig> production in the lungs of clp mice depends on infiltrated vγ <dig> γδ t cell subset, which likely contributes to host protective immune response. since adverse roles have been proposed for il- <dig> during experimental sepsis, the effect of il- <dig> in the lungs of clp mice needs further investigation. it has been described that il- <dig> derived from γδ t cells promotes epithelial repair in different tissues , suggesting that il- <dig> produced by vγ <dig> t cells might act on lung epithelium, promoting tissue repair and ameliorating mouse illness after clp . il- <dig> has also been associated with neutrophil influx into inflamed tissue, which can lead to either protective or harmful outcomes  <cit> . concerning lung immune response, effective bacteria clearance by neutrophils reduces the risk of lung failure  <cit> ; however, it is well known that excessive neutrophil activation and production of myeloperoxidase  can cause tissue damage  <cit> . in our study, we observed increased neutrophil numbers in the lungs of clp mice, which was significantly reduced after anti-vγ <dig> mab treatment , suggesting neutrophil involvement in the resolutive response. the involvement of tissue-recruited neutrophils coordinated by il-17+ γδ t cells in tissue repair has been demonstrated in different experimental models. γδ t cell knockout  mice submitted to inflammatory insults are shown to present reduced neutrophil and mpo accumulation in the lungs, liver and cornea, which correlated with increased lesions and delayed epithelial regeneration . moreover, in a model of corneal epithelial abrasion, it was demonstrated that γδ t cells induced, via il- <dig>  the production of vascular endothelial growth factor  by neutrophils, promoting corneal nerve regeneration  <cit> . our study evidenced that il-17+ vγ <dig> t lymphocytes migrate into injured lungs of clp mice, presenting a beneficial role during the course of sepsis.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we show that early-activated vγ <dig> t lymphocytes continuously accumulate in inflamed lungs during the course of sepsis and that local il- <dig> production depends on the tissue infiltration of this subset, which preferentially produces this cytokine. based on our findings, we also propose that vγ <dig> t lymphocytes contribute to the protective immune response of septic mice and delay mortality. further complementary investigation concerning cellular and molecular mechanisms of vγ <dig> t cell/il- <dig> pathway associated with protection during sepsis is of extreme value to bring new insights to approach novel targets and therapies.
