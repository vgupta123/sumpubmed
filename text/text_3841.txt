BACKGROUND
apicomplexa is a phylum of protozoan parasites that infects both humans and animals, causing serious health problems world-wide. plasmodium falciparum  and plasmodium vivax , for example, cause malaria, which kills over a million people every year  <cit> . toxoplasma gondii  infects one third of the entire human population, causing brain and eye defects in the unborn fetuses of infected women  <cit> . cryptosporidium parvum  infects humans and other warm-blooded animals, causing severe diarrhea  <cit> . genome sequencing projects for at least  <dig> species of apicomplexa, including several plasmodium species  <cit> , two theileria species  <cit> , babesia bovis  <cit> , cp  <cit>  and tg, have been carried out during the last decade.

the resulting genomic sequences have been analyzed, revealing that even though the apicomplexan parasites are believed to have been derived from a common ancestor, their genome sizes and compositions vary widely. the cp genome is only  <dig>  mb, with only 5% of its genes containing introns, a proportion which nearly parallels that of the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome  <cit> . the tg genome, by contrast, is  <dig> mb, averages  <dig>  introns per gene, and has a g+c content of 52%  <cit> ; whereas the pf genome is  <dig> mb, and is extremely a+t rich, having a g+c content of just 19%  <cit> . respective genome information for each of these species has been made publicly available in one or more of the following databases: plasmodb  <cit> , cryptodb  <cit> , toxodb  <cit> , eupathdb  <cit> , and genedb  <cit> .

obviously, accurately annotated genomes are important tools for elucidating the genetic basis of parasiticism in apicomplexa. such genetic knowledge will form the basis for drug development and potential vaccine candidates for these parasites. however, the quality of the accumulated genomic data is currently insufficient for these purposes. the genomic sequences of py and pb are still very incomplete, consisting of numerous short contigs . an even more serious issue is that the genome-associated gene annotations  appear to be imperfect. even for the well-annotated p. falciparum genome, recent reports have suggested it contains many errors  <cit> . because the structures of the genomes and genes are very different from species to species, it is difficult to make precise, uniform gene prediction, using computational methods such as genscan  <cit>  or glimmerm  <cit> . therefore, experimental evidence, such as cdna sequences, is extremely important and should be more intensively collected and taken into consideration for annotation purposes.

we previously developed a method, called oligo-capping, for constructing full-length cdna libraries and have used it to collect full-length cdnas from numerous organisms  <cit> . these cdna sequences have been published online in two databases: full-parasites and comparasite  <cit> . full-parasites  <cit>  contains 5'-end-single-pass-read expressed-sequence-tags  for the pf, pv, py, pb, cp and tg genomes, and for the tapeworm echinococcus multilocularis  <cit> . comparasite  <cit>  is an integrated database containing the transcriptomes of the same six apicomplexa species  <cit> . in it, homologous gene groups are clustered and any combination of these species can be comparatively analyzed. while analyzing the cdna data in these databases, we noticed significant inconsistencies between our cdna annotations and those of the publically available annotated genes.

in this study, we first analyzed  <dig>  5'-end partially sequenced cdnas which were isolated from six apicomplexan parasite full-length cdna libraries. we found that a significant number of current gene models contain inconsistencies and therefore should be re-evaluated. to evaluate the gene models at the complete sequence level, we completely sequenced  <dig> full-length tg cdnas and drew the same conclusions. in addition, we found that the possible errors in the publically available annotations were largely due to overprediction of the exons. here we report the first, large-scale systematic evaluation of the current genomic annotation of apicomplexan parasites based on our unique full-length cdna data.

RESULTS
mapping and clustering of the 5'-ests from oligo-capped full-length cdna libraries
we generated 5'-est cdna sequence collections from six apicomplexan parasites and mapped them to their respective genomic sequences  using sim <dig>  <cit> . we successfully mapped  <dig>  cdnas to the pf genome,  <dig>  to the pv genome,  <dig>  to the py genome,  <dig> to the pb genome,  <dig>  to the cp genome, and  <dig>  to the tg genome . these data are also available at our websites  <cit> .

the mapped cdna sequences were clustered and compared with the annotated gene models in the plasmodb, cryptdb and toxodb databases  <cit> . an annotated gene model was considered to correspond to a cdna when at least one of its exons overlapped the cdna. the total number of cdnas corresponding to annotated gene models was  <dig>  for pf,  <dig>  for pv,  <dig>  for py,  <dig> for pb,  <dig>  for cp and  <dig>  for tg. among the annotated gene models,  <dig>   from pf,  <dig>   from pv,  <dig>   from py,  <dig>  from pb,  <dig>  from cp, and  <dig>  from tg were represented in our cdna collections. conversely,  <dig> cdna clusters in pf,  <dig> in pv,  <dig> in py,  <dig> in pb,  <dig> in cp, and  <dig> in tg did not correspond to any annotated gene model . although some of these latter clusters may actually be contaminated genomic dna, we believe most, if not all, represent actual transcripts because; i) some are spliced  and definitely represent expressed genes; ii) rt-pcr analysis in toxoplasma indicates that most of them are rnas but not dnas; and iii) intensive dnase treatment was performed during library construction.

discrepancies between the annotated gene models and our cdnas
using the 5'-end partial cdna sequences corresponding to the annotated gene models, we evaluated the inconsistencies between them at three levels :

 nucleotide-level: the total number of nucleotides either "exonic" in the cdnas that are mis-annotated as "intronic" in the gene models or vice versa.

 exon-level: the number of exons that contained at least one mis-annotated nucleotide resulting in one or more different exon-intron boundaries.

 gene-level: the number of annotated gene models that contained at least one mis-annotated exon.

we found that the average error rates in the gene models of the apicomplexa genomes was  4% at the nucleotide-level, resulting in  a 14% error rate at the exon-level and  a 16% error rate at the annotated gene-level . we also found that some cdna clusters  corresponded to more than one annotated gene, with the two adjacent annotated genes likely representing erroneously separated genes that should be re-annotated as one gene .

for further detailed information see the text.

there were also a significant number of un-annotated transcripts in each of the genomes. we found that  <dig>  cdna clusters in pf were not represented by any of the annotated gene models. similarly, 32% of the cdna clusters in pv, 15% in py, 25% in pb, 16% in cp, and 32% in tg were not previously annotated. it is possible that some of these clusters might actually overlap with annotated genes, once the entire sequences are determined, but a significant proportion of them appear to represent hitherto un-annotated genes .

our cdna-based evaluation of the current genome annotations indicates that the current gene models are still incomplete and contain many errors. because our evaluation is based only on the 5'-end of the transcripts, more inconsistencies will likely be revealed once the entire cdna sequences are determined and evaluated .

possible causes of the discrepancies
it was surprising that even the p. falciparum genome, which is the most intensively annotated apicomplexa genome to date  <cit> , contains so many discrepancies. although some experimental evidence, ranging from random est sequencing to rt-pcr of individual genes had been collected, the amount seems to be insufficient. a more thorough accumulation of full-length cdna information is necessary for more precise genome annotation of pf.

it was not surprising to find far more inconsistencies for t. gondii  than pf because of its larger genome size and more frequent use of introns, which makes gene prediction more difficult . indeed, the frequency  of un-annotated cdna clusters was the highest for tg. in contrast, the genome annotations for cp were exceptionally accurate because the cp genome is very small and the transcripts rarely have introns . inaccurate gene annotations might be an intrinsic problem with genomes as complex as that of tg.

completeness of the genomic sequences is an additional factor in the correct annotation of open reading frames. the genome sequences of py and pb still consist of many small contigs. the number of annotated genes in py and pb are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, both of which are considerably higher than the  <dig>  annotated genes in pf. py and pb are evolutionarily close, so the large difference in the number of annotated genes may reflect false annotations in both genomes. in fact, we observed that in pb, 27% of the protein coding regions of the annotated genes did not start from an atg site, so their cdss are intrinsically incorrect. when we evaluated these annotations in more detail, we sometimes found that two neighboring annotated genes in py or pb that mapped onto different contigs were only, correctly, represented as one gene in pf, leading to more genes having been annotated in py and pb than in pf. many such split transcripts could be fixed by considering our full-length cdna information, thus helping to sew together the current patchwork of genomic contigs .

the base composition of the genome seems to be less deterministic when it comes to discrepancies. for example, plasmodium genomes are generally extremely a+t rich, with the pf genome being the most biased and the pv genome being the most moderate   <cit> . in spite of the varying g+c content among these species and presumed conservation of most of the genes, the accuracy of the genomic annotation varied substantially . the more accurate annotation of the pf genome may have been achieved by more careful optimization of the computational protocols, such as the use of glimmerm  <cit>  along with more detailed manual inspection  <cit> .

utilization of full-length cdnas for identification of transcriptional start sites and 5'untranslated regions
the second advantage in using the 5'-ends of the full-length cdna sequences was that we could annotate the exact transcriptional start sites  and the complete 5' untranslated regions  of the transcripts. this information is essential for characterizing putative transcriptional regulatory elements in the upstream promoter regions and translational control elements embedded in the 5'-utrs  <cit> . as almost all current gene annotations are "protein-coding sequence  based annotations", they are generally useless for analyzing regions upstream of the initiator atg sequences. for example, in table  <dig>  in several cases we found that there were one or more introns between the predicted initiator atg and the tss, specifically 22% of the cases in pf, 20% in pv, 28% in py, 22% in pb, 3% in cp, and 13% in tg. since no information on the tsss or utrs could be obtained from the proximal regions of the current gene models, they were not useful for an evaluation like this.

see methods for further details.

tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the results for the statistical analyses of the 5'-utrs and tsss. the average 5'-utr length was shortest for cp, which may reflect the fact that both the genome size and the average gene size are smallest in this species. we also found that the tsss of the plasmodium species are much more dispersed than those of tg or cp. these characteristic features of the 5'-ends of the mrnas may be a sign of differences in both transcriptional and translational control of gene expression among apicomplexan parasites. in addition, statistical analysis revealed that the 5'-utr length of the genes associated with the gene ontology term "ribosome" is shorter than the other genes in both tg and py ); however, this tendency was not observed in the other species. the unique data presented here should serve as a firm foundation for future analysis of the transcriptional regulatory networks of parasite genes.

complete sequencing of full-length cdnas in toxoplasma
for a more detailed evaluation of the annotated gene models, we chose representative full-length tg cdna clones from each of  <dig>  clusters and attempted to completely sequence them by the primer-walking method. finally, we were able to determine  <dig> full-length sequences with an average length of  <dig>  kb, as compared to  <dig>  kb for the annotated transcripts, corresponding to the  <dig>  clusters. these sequences included  <dig> cdnas that overlapped one or more annotated genes  and  <dig> cdnas that did not overlap any annotated gene.

based on the cdna sequences, we assigned the longest orfs as the putative protein coding sequences . as shown in figure  <dig>  for cdnas overlapping annotated genes,  <dig> of the deduced cdss  were longer than  <dig> bp  with an average length of  <dig> bp, suggesting that most of the full-length cdnas we used for this analysis were indeed protein-coding transcripts. to further confirm that our cdnas do not represent aberrant transcripts, we determined whether or not the cdnas might be subject to nonsense-mediated decay   <cit> . by definition, when an intron exists in more than  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon, the transcript may be subject to nmd. we found that only  <dig>  of the cdnas might be subject to nmd.

we compared the cdss which were deduced from our full-length cdnas with the cdss of the annotated gene models in a way similar to that in which we compared the 5'-end ests, and again found many inconsistencies. the discrepancies were, on average,  14% at the nucleotide-level,  36% at the exon-level, and  41% at the gene-level. in  <dig> cases, there was at least one inconsistency in the cds region of the annotated gene which altered the deduced amino acid sequence. the distribution of the altered amino acid lengths is shown in figure 2c, again illustrating the need for full-length cdna data in order to precisely annotate the genes.

detailed evaluation of inconsistent gene annotations
for the  <dig> full-length tg cdnas, out of  <dig> that correspond to unique annotated genes, we analysed the discrepancies in more detail. namely we analyzed them with regard to their impact on the cdss and observed that there were four major types of inconsistencies, involving either the translation start site or the termination site. we characterized them as follows:

 n-terminal inconsistency: only the first atg site was inconsistent.

 c-terminal inconsistency: only the translation terminal codon was inconsistent.

 internal inconsistency: both the first atg site and the terminal codon were consistent, but there was at least one inconsistency in the body of the cds.

 total inconsistency: both the first atg site and the rest of the cds were inconsistent.

types  and  comprised 65% of the inconsistencies . for those of type , we found that most of the cdnas had cdss shorter than those of the annotated genes, with the first atg site of the gene model usually being embedded in an upstream exon that does not exist in the actual cdna . there is some concern that a shortened n-terminus represents an artifact due to erroneous cloning of a 5'-end-truncated cdna by the oligo-capping method. however, we believe that such errors are infrequent because in most cases the 5'-ends of the cdnas were covered by at least three independent cdnas. for type  inconsistencies, interestingly, a similar tendency was observed in the 3'-end and the c-terminal regions. additional exons were predicted in the downstream regions of the gene models, so that the terminal codon in the cdnas was bypassed due to questionable splicing. similarly, we found that probable overprediction of exons was the major cause of inconsistencies for those of type . in many cases, one exon in the cdna was spuriously split into two in the gene model. these observations implicate that spurious prediction of extra exons in the annotated genes is the major cause of inconsistencies. the average number of exons was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the cdnas and the gene models, respectively; average overprediction in the latter was  <dig>  exons per gene.

for details about the categorization of types i–iv see text.

for the rest of the cases ), the deduced amino acid sequences were inconsistent throughout the cds. we were concerned that some of these inconsistencies may have been due to errors in the prediction of the cds from the cdna sequences, since two different strains, rh and me <dig>  were used for making the cdnas and the genomic sequence, respectively. sequence polymorphism  may have lead to some frame-shifts or base substitutions, thus changing the amino acid sequences and resulting in gene model inconsistency. when we substituted the original cdna sequences for the mapped region sequences from the me <dig> genome for cds prediction, we found that 27%  of the re-predicted cdss overlapped with cdss of annotated genes to some extent at the deduced amino acid level. however, for the other  <dig> cases, the cdss in the gene models did not overlap and will be analysed further.

consistency of full-length toxoplasma cdna transcripts
to examine the impact of the cds changes, we analyzed the so-called functional annotations that were based on either the annotated gene models or the full-length cdnas. we first looked for affected functional protein motifs using interproscan to search the pfam database  <cit> . the predicted functional motifs were found to be different in  <dig> cases, specifically, in  <dig> cases the motifs were found only in the annotated gene models but not in the cdnas, indicating erroneous prediction, and in one case the motif was found in the cdna but not in the annotated gene model . there results indicate a tendency of gene prediction programs to assign exons in genomic regions if they encode amino acid sequences containing known motifs.

in addition, because we found many discrepancies in the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of the proteins , we examined the inconsistent motifs for subcellular protein sorting signals using psort  <cit>  and found that changes in the deduced amino acid sequences resulted in altered subcellular localization of  <dig> cases . disturbingly, such errors in the gene models may seriously interfere with subsequent gene functional analyses.

cdnas non-overlapping with the annotated genes
we also analyzed  <dig> cdnas that did not overlap with any of the annotated gene regions. even in these cases,  <dig> cdnas  encoded proteins containing  <dig> or more amino acids . when we examined the deduced amino acid sequences using blastp  to check if there were any homologous proteins, significant hits were found in at least six cases. for the rest of the cases, we searched for protein functional domains using pfam and found possible functional protein motifs in seven more cases . to experimentally confirm the existence of these transcripts, we also performed rt-pcr . in  <dig> of  <dig> clusters , rt-pcr detected positive bands, suggesting there are actually transcripts at the corresponding regions. these results indicate that current gene annotations have overlooked a significant number of protein-coding genes that could have active biological roles. interestingly, no clear cdss were identified for nine cdnas in our analysis. these cdnas may correspond to non-protein-coding transcripts, many of which have been recently identified in parasite genomes  <cit> , and may be important targets for further exploration of the apicomplexa transcriptome.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we describe the results of our analysis using 5'-end partial sequences from full-length cdnas to systematically evaluate the current gene models for six species of apicomplexan parasites. our results demonstrate that the current gene models need to be improved through annotations based on more intensive analyses using full-length cdnas. while we could not determine the complete sequences for all of the cdnas, except for toxoplasma, the remaining sequence information is just as critical to complete. emerging technologies such as next-generation sequencers may speed up such analyses and reduce their overall cost  <cit> . further integration of the pre-existing data, such as publicly available ests and peptide sequences, is also important. the integration of various experimental approaches and data will lead to increasingly accurate genome annotations and thus provide a solid basis for further research on apicomplexan parasites.
