BACKGROUND
tomato leaf mold disease, caused by the biotrophic fungus cladosporium fulvum, is a serious disease of solanum lycopersicum   <cit> . this disease can reduce both fruit yield and quality, and sometimes even kill tomato plants. in compatible interactions with susceptible tomato plants, fungal spores germinate on the abaxial surface of leaves and enter the leaf apoplast through stomata. hyphae emerge through the stomata and continue to grow and ramify. finally, the infected cells undergo necrosis  <cit> . tomato cf genes confer resistance to c. fulvum and mediate incompatible interactions between c. fulvum and tomato plants. in incompatible interactions, fungal hyphae are arrested in their development soon after penetration of the sub-stomatal cavity, and their growth is restricted to limited necrotic lesions  <cit> . plant breeders introduced cf resistance genes from wild solanum species into cultivated tomato to control the disease many years ago  <cit> , and this is still an efficient method in tomato cultivation today. a number of cf genes have been introgressed for use in commercial breeding, but this artificial selection has created evolutionary pressure on c. fulvum. to date, many cf genes have been overcome by c. fulvum carrying matching avirulence genes . a race that has evolved to overcome the resistance genes cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  and cf- <dig> was reported by lindhout et al.  <cit> . in northeast china, the c. fulvum physiological races  <dig> . <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig> have evolved to overcome the cf- <dig> gene and become the dominant races in only nine years  <cit> . the number of cf genes that can be used in breeding is decreasing, making it necessary to identify new resistance genes and breed them into tomato cultivars.

cf genes, which encode predicted membrane-bound proteins with extracytoplasmic leucine-rich repeats   <cit> , confer resistance to specific races of c. fulvum through recognition of avr peptides secreted into the leaf apoplast during infection  <cit> . in the tomato–c. fulvum interaction, a strict correlation exists between the triggering of a hypersensitive response  and resistance, as the various avrs induce a specific hr in tomato genotypes carrying a matching cf resistance gene  <cit> . in  <dig>   <dig> cf genes located on  <dig> chromosomes were reported in tomato  <cit> . later studies showed that the cf genes were organized into clusters of resistance gene homologues, which have been designated hcr2s and hcr9s for homologues of the cladosporium resistance genes cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . hcr <dig> loci, including the cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> loci, have been mapped to the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . three hcr <dig> homologues were found at the cf- <dig> locus. the cf- <dig>  and cf- <dig>  genes are nearly identical, and are functional genes that confer resistance to strains of c. fulvum that carry the matching avr <dig> gene. the other homologue  is not functional  <cit> . at the cf- <dig> locus, four homologues were found, among which hcr2-5c is the corresponding functional gene cf- <dig>  <cit> . the cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> loci, each comprising five hcr9s, have been mapped to the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . hcr9-4d and hcr9-9c are the functional genes cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . tomato plants carrying the cf- <dig> gene have shown efficient resistance in the field and no infection has been reported for this gene to date. cf- <dig> was assigned to the long arm of chromosome  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> . our previously study showed that cf- <dig> was a dominant gene  <cit>  and induced a remarkable hr in tomato plants inoculated with c. fulvum physiological race  <dig> . <dig> , indicating that it is a functional member of the cf gene family.

slaf-seq, which is based on high-throughput sequencing, is a recently developed high-resolution strategy for large-scale de novo single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery and genotyping  <cit> . this method is relatively low-cost and efficient, and can be used for gene and quantitative trait locus  mapping. the efficiency of this approach was tested in rice and soybean, and it was successfully used to construct genetic maps for sesame   <cit> . we applied this approach to an f <dig> population in combination with genome resequencing of the parents to map and characterize the cf- <dig> gene rapidly.

RESULTS

association analysis and candidate gene screening
according to the results of Δsnp index calculation, all diff-markers were distributed on chromosome  <dig>  regions with three or more consecutive diff-markers were regarded as association regions. we found three association regions including  <dig> diff-markers and  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> in slaf-seq analysis . to further narrow the mapping region, snps in the association regions from parental resequencing were analyzed in combination with the f <dig> bulk slaf-seq data. forty-three snps showed the moneymaker base type in the susceptible pool, and both parental base types in the resistant pool were screened out. of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> were distributed in an approximately  <dig> -mb region in association region i, one was in association region ii and eight were in association region iii . further analysis was carried out based on the results of association analysis and gene function annotation. finally, seven genes with cf-type characters were screened out, all of which were inside the  <dig> -mb association region i that was identified in the previous snp analysis. these genes were solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  solyc01g <dig> . <dig> and solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  respectively .table  <dig> detail information of association regions

quantitative real-time pcr analysis
according to the results of qrt-pcr analysis, of the seven candidate genes, two  showed expression patterns related to the resistance response process. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> gene was expressed at a low level before inoculation, and increased slightly after inoculation. this expression level was maintained for about 5 days, and then increased rapidly at 7 days after inoculation  and kept increasing during the following days. the highest expression was at  <dig> dai, which was 62-fold higher than the  <dig> dai value. the expression level of the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> gene was relatively lower at every stage compared with the corresponding level of solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  while the general expression patterns of the two genes were similar. all other five genes showed unrelated expression patterns during the whole penetration process.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of the relative gene expression of seven candidate genes



candidate loci sequencing and sequence analysis
the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> and solyc01g <dig> . <dig> loci of cgn <dig> and moneymaker were sequenced successfully . sequence alignment showed that the dna sequences of both loci contained mutations between cgn <dig> and moneymaker. at the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus, the encoded protein contained a signal peptide,  <dig> lrrs and a transmembrane region. several snps existed in the coding region, but no difference was found in the conserved domain distribution between cgn <dig> and moneymaker. at the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus, a 60-bp insertion was found near the n-terminus of the coding region in cgn <dig>  this insertion changed the orf, provided a signal peptide for the original cf- <dig>  and led to an increased number of lrr domains , according to conserved domain and feature analysis .fig.  <dig> protein structure comparative analysis of candidate loci and classical cf proteins. all proteins contain a signal peptide, leucine-rich repeats  and a transmembrane region except for cf- <dig> of moneymaker, which lacks the signal peptide domain. the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus proteins in cgn <dig> and moneymaker are very different in domain type and lrr number, while the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus proteins in cgn <dig> and moneymaker contain the same domains and lrr number. the red box with the letter “a” inside shows the signal peptide domain and the blue box with the letter “b” inside shows the transmembrane region



multiple dna sequence alignment of the candidate genes and other cf-4/ <dig> locus genes showed that the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus of cgn <dig> had a close evolutionary relationship with the cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> genes. the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus of cgn <dig> showed a short evolutionary distance to the cf- <dig> gene, and the level of sequence divergence was very low .fig.  <dig> cluster analysis of candidate and other genes in the cf-4/ <dig> locus. candidate  <dig> is solyc01g <dig> . <dig> of cgn <dig> and candidate  <dig> is solyc01g <dig> . <dig> of cgn18423



marker development and linkage analysis
a sequence characterized amplified region  marker  was found to co-segregate with the resistance trait. this marker was developed based on the 60-bp insertion in the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> locus in cgn <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  a fragment of 300 bp was amplified in cgn <dig>  a fragment of 240 bp was amplified in moneymaker, and both of these fragments were amplified in the f <dig> samples. among 345 f <dig> plants,  <dig> susceptible plants showed the moneymaker genotype,  <dig> resistant plants showed the cgn <dig> or f <dig> genotype, and three susceptible plants showed the f <dig> genotype. in the f <dig> lines test, all 131 f3- <dig> plants showed the cgn <dig> genotype, the f3- <dig> plants included  <dig> plants with the cgn <dig> genotype,  <dig> plants with the moneymaker genotype, and  <dig> plants with the f <dig> genotype, and all  <dig> plants of f3- <dig> line showed the moneymaker genotype. the inoculation and molecular marker identification results of all f <dig> line plants showed consensus.fig.  <dig> marker p <dig> amplification in different generations. p1: cgn18423; p2: moneymaker; f1: f <dig> plants from the cross of cgn <dig> and moneymaker; 1–10: resistant plants of the f <dig> population; 11–20: susceptible plants of the f <dig> population



discussion
the cf- <dig> gene was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1
cf- <dig> was assigned to the long arm of chromosome  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> , while this gene was mapped at the short arm of chromosome  <dig> in this study. although some diff_markers were found on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> according to the results of f <dig> bulk slaf-seq analysis, they could not form association regions in further association analysis. most diff_markers were found on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and these markers showed us three association regions in association analysis. the position information for these regions was very reasonable for the cf genes were organized into clusters of resistance gene homologues and most cf genes mapped to chromosome  <dig> or chromosome  <dig> so far.

three association regions for the cf- <dig> gene were identified in f <dig> bulk slaf-seq analysis. this result was not as accurate as we expected. all association regions in this study were on chromosome  <dig>  and this may have been the reason why the location result was not accurate. the arrangements of cf genes on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> are very complex. two loci  of the clustered hcr <dig> genes have been mapped to this region, and each comprises five hcr9s  <cit> . additionally, the cf- <dig> gene  <cit>  has been mapped and closely linked to cf-4/ <dig>  <cit> . other studies have mapped the cf-ecp <dig>  cf-ecp <dig>  cf-ecp <dig>  cf-ecp <dig> and cf-ecp <dig> genes to the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . many homologous fragments produced by evolutionary events are present in these genes and intergenic regions. these homologous sequences may influence the reads mapping and snp statistics.

the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> . <dig> of cgn <dig> is a new hcr <dig> member in the cf-4/ <dig> locus
the cf- <dig> gene originating from lycopersicon hirsutum and the cf- <dig> gene originating from l. pimpinellifolium were mapped to the cf-4/ <dig> locus  <cit> . this locus is flanked by conserved lipoxygenase sequences and is very complex, while only a single hcr <dig> gene has been found at the cf-4/ <dig> locus in the disease-susceptible cultivar of lycopersicon esculentum moneymaker  <cit> ; this gene was designated cf- <dig>  the solyc01g <dig> . <dig> gene locus in moneymaker  is just the cf- <dig> locus; therefore, our candidate gene solyc01g <dig> . <dig> of cgn <dig>  is an allele of cf- <dig>  sequence analysis showed that a 60-bp insertion was present in the n-terminal coding region, and this insertion resulted in changes in the orf. blast search results indicated that no genes were completely homologous to the solyc01g <dig> .1-cgn <dig> gene, which suggests that the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> .1-cgn <dig> is a novel member of the cf-4/ <dig> locus.

cf genes encode proteins with classical signal peptide domains in their n-termini, lrrs, and a transmembrane region in their c-termini. cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> have identical c-termini  <cit> , while a significant degree of sequence divergence is found in their n-terminal portions. this difference between cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> produces their recognition specificity  <cit> . a similar result was found in this study; the c-terminal portion of the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> .1-cgn <dig> had high identity to cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  while the n-terminal portion contained a high degree of sequence divergence. this result indicates that solyc01g <dig> .1-cgn <dig> may have recognition specificity that has formed based on a similar evolutionary mechanism to cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  lrrs can form a β-strand/β-turn motif in which the hypervariable residues are solvent-exposed and potentially contribute to recognition specificity. all hcr9s at the cf-4/ <dig> locus encode proteins with  <dig> lrrs with the exception of 4b, which contains  <dig> lrrs, and cf- <dig>  which comprises  <dig> lrrs  <cit> . the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> .1-cgn <dig> encoded  <dig> lrrs, which is different to all other hcr9s, providing conditions for the formation of a specific motif for ligand recognition. phylogenetic analysis showed that the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> .1-cgn <dig> had very short evolutionary distances to functional hcr9s including cf- <dig>  cf- <dig>  hcr9-9a and hcr9-9b ; these genes were clustered in a branch with a high degree of evolution, and were distinct from other non-functional hcr9s. this result suggested a high possibility that the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> .1-cgn <dig> was our target gene cf- <dig> 

the marker p <dig> can be used in marker-assisted selection  breeding
p <dig> is a codominant marker that co-segregates with the resistance trait. this marker was designed based on a 60-bp insertion in solyc01g <dig> . <dig>  making the products in cgn <dig> and moneymaker different in size. this marker was tested in f <dig> plants and different f <dig> lines. only three f <dig> plants showed an unexpected genotype. these three f <dig> plants were susceptible in the inoculation test, but showed the f <dig> genotype in the p <dig> test. hammond-kosack and jones  <cit>  suggested that the increased c. fulvum invasion of host tissue and the higher titer of intercellular fluid required to elicit a necrotic or chlorotic response in lines where a cf gene was present in a heterozygous state indicates that cf genes are incompletely dominant. the cf- <dig> gene may also be slightly affected by incompletely dominant inheritance, leading to a higher disease severity score for some heterozygous plants, and these plants were divided into the susceptible bulk. although not all samples gave consistent results in the inoculation and p <dig> tests, the veracity of p <dig> in genotype identification is sufficient for mas breeding work.

the combination of slaf-seq and parental resequencing is effective for gene mapping
the slaf-seq method provides significant advantages for developing large numbers of trait-related markers and target gene mapping. genome resequencing can provide more details about genome sequences than slaf-seq, and this information is useful to improve the precision of gene mapping. in this study, three association regions totaling  <dig>  mb in size were obtained in f <dig> bulk slaf-seq analysis, and a  <dig> -mb region with seven candidate genes was finally identified based on further snp analysis using data from parental resequencing. the results of qrt-pcr analysis showed the accuracy of the mapping region at the transcriptional level. the current study also indicates that the combination of f <dig> bulk slaf-seq and parental resequencing is a good choice for both relatively low cost and high efficiency gene mapping and trait-related gene screening.

impact of the current work on plant breeding and resistance mechanism research
breeding to obtain resistant cultivars is an efficient method for the control of leaf mold outbreaks. the differentiation of c. fulvum physiological races is very rapid, and new cf resistance genes are of great significance to breeding. cf- <dig> was located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> and one candidate gene solyc01g <dig> . <dig> was assigned to the cf-4/ <dig> locus, while another candidate gene solyc01g <dig> . <dig> was mapped close to the cf-4/ <dig> locus, which indicates that the cf- <dig> gene may have a direct evolutionary relationship with cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  the characteristics of cf- <dig> gene introgression to other cultivars may be similar to those of cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> and we have lots of experience in breeding cultivars carrying the cf- <dig> or cf- <dig> gene. our location results will help guide the breeding of cultivars carrying the cf- <dig> gene. the cf gene family is important for studying plant resistance  gene evolution and r/avr interaction mechanisms . the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> . <dig> is a new member of the hcr9s and has a close evolutionary relationship with cf- <dig> and cf- <dig>  it provides us a new gene material for plant resistance mechanism and r gene evolution research. the results we obtained in the present study were based on genetic mapping, expression pattern analysis and sequence analysis, but to clone the cf- <dig> gene correctly, we still need functional verification such as virus-induced gene silencing  and transgenic experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used f <dig> slaf-seq and parental resequencing to locate the cf- <dig> gene. a total of  <dig> diff-markers were obtained. three association regions consisting of  <dig> diff-markers and  <dig> genes were found on chromosome  <dig>  a  <dig> -mb region with seven candidate genes on the short arm was obtained through snp analysis, and the candidate genes solyc01g <dig> . <dig> and solyc01g <dig> . <dig> were identified from these seven genes by qrt-pcr analysis. the candidate gene solyc01g <dig> . <dig> is a new member of the hcr9s in the cf-4/ <dig> locus. a scar marker  that was co-segregant with the resistance trait was developed that can be used in mas breeding work. these results provide a basis for cf- <dig> gene cloning and application of the cf- <dig> gene in breeding.
