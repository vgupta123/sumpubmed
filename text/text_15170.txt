BACKGROUND
viruses were traditionally characterized by morphological features  and physicochemical and antigenic properties  <cit> . at the dna level, the evolutionary relationships of many families and genera have been explored by sequence analysis of single gene or gene families, such as polymerase, capsid and movement genes  <cit> . the international committee on the taxonomy of viruses  publishes a report on the virus taxonomy system every five years. phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of viruses based on complete genome data have become increasingly important as more and more whole viral genomes are sequenced  <cit> 

the phylogeny based on single genes or gene families contains ambiguity because horizontal gene transfer , along with gene duplication and gene capture from hosts, appear to be frequent in large dna viruses  <cit> . whether single-gene based analysis can properly infer viral species phylogeny is debatable  <cit> . one of the unusual aspects of viral genomes is that they exhibit high sequence divergence  <cit> . several works have attempted to infer viral phylogeny from their whole genomes  <cit> . among these studies of genome trees, the alignment-free methods proposed by gao and qi  <cit> , wu et al  <cit> , gao et al  <cit>  and stuart et al  <cit>  seem to be sufficiently powerful to resolve the phylogeny of viruses at large evolutionary distance. the present study represents another effort of applying an alignment-free method in analysing complete genome data to elucidate the phylogeny of two virus groups of different genome size, the large dsdna viruses and parvoviruses.

the dna of dna viruses is usually double-stranded , but may also be single-stranded . according to the viiith report of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses   <cit> , the dsdna viruses can be classified into certain families or unassigned genus. the genome sizes of dsdna viruses are usually larger than  <dig> kb except those in the families polyomaviridae  and papillomaviridae . on the other hand, the genome sizes of ssdna viruses are smaller than  <dig> kb. the parvoviruses constitute a family established in  <dig> to encompass all small non-enveloped viruses with approximately  <dig> kb linear, self-priming, ssdna genomes  <cit> . according to the viiith report of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses   <cit> , this family is separated into two subfamilies, parvovirinae and densovirinae. viruses in the subfamily parvovirinae infect vertebrates and vertebrate cell cultures, and frequently associate with other viruses, while those in the subfamily densovirinae infect arthropods or other invertebrates  <cit> . dependovirus requires co-infection with herpes or adenovirus for replication and is not itself pathogenic  <cit> . due to the fatal nature of infection with densoviruses on their respective species, it has been suggested that densoviruses may represent suitable vectors for insect control  <cit> . the regions of identity and similarity between genomes of human and rodent parvoviruses and their respective hosts have been studied  <cit> . more features of parvoviruses can be found in the reviews by tattersall and cotmore  <cit> .

the whole genome sequences are generally accepted as excellent tools for studying evolution  <cit> . on the basis of characters used to cluster genomes, snel et al  <cit>  reviewed that genome trees can be globally divided into five classes: alignment-free genome trees based on statistic properties of the complete genome, gene content trees based on the presence and absence of genes, genome trees based on chromosomal gene order, genome trees based on average sequence similarity, and phylogenomic trees based either on the collection of phylogenetic trees derived from shared gene families or on a concatenated alignment of those families. due to the problems caused by the uncertainty in alignment  <cit> , existing tools for phylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment could not be directly applied to the whole-genome comparison and phylogenomic studies. there has been a growing interest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data  <cit> . recently jun et al  <cit>  used an alignment-free method, the feature frequency profiles of whole proteomes, to construct a whole-proteome phylogeny of  <dig> prokaryotes and  <dig> unicellular eukaryotes. in their whole-proteome trees, archaea, eubacteria and eukarya are clearly separated. similarly, the analyses based on dynamical language  model  <cit>  and markov model  <cit>  without sequence alignment using  <dig> prokaryotes and six eukaryotes have yielded trees separating the three domains of life with the relationships among the taxa consistent with those based on traditional analyses. these two methods were also used to analyze the complete chloroplast genomes  <cit> . the cv tree method  <cit>  was recently used to analyze the fungal phylogeny  <cit> . a simplified version based on the cv tree method was used to analyze gene sequencesfor the purpose of dna barcoding  <cit> . zheng et al  <cit>  proposed a complexity-based measure for phylogenetic analysis. guyon et al  <cit>  compared four alignment-free string distances for complete genome phylogeny using  <dig> α-proteobacteria. the four distances are maximum significant matches  distance, k-word  or k-mer distance , average common substring  distance and compression  distance. the results showed that the msm distance outperforms the other three distances and the cv tree method cannot give good phylogenetic topology for the  <dig> α-proteobacteria. we recently modified our dynamical language  method  <cit>  by replacing the correlation distance  by the chord distance  and proposed a way to select the optimal feature length based on average relative difference analysis  <cit> . testing the modified dl method on the data sets used in previous studies  <cit> , we found that this method can give very good phylogenetic topologies  <cit> , while the cv tree method cannot give good phylogenetic topology for the  <dig> α-proteobacteria  <cit> . in the present paper, we adopt the dl method  <cit>  to analyze a large number of genomes of the large dsdna viruses and parvoviruses.

RESULTS
the whole dna sequences, all protein-coding dna sequences and all protein sequences from complete genomes of the selected  <dig> large dsdna viruses and  <dig> selected parvoviruses were analyzed. the trees of k =  <dig> to  <dig> based on all protein sequences and the trees of k ≤  <dig> based on the whole dna sequences and all protein-coding dna sequences using the dl method  <cit>  were constructed. after comparing all the trees constructed by the present method with the classification of the  <dig> large dsdna viruses and  <dig> parvoviruses given in the viiith report of ictv  <cit> , we found that the trees for large dsdna viruses and parvoviruses based on all protein sequences are better than those based on all protein-coding dna sequences and the whole dna sequences. furthermore, for the phylogenetic trees of  <dig> large dsdna viruses based on all protein sequences, the tree of k =  <dig> provides the best result among the cases of k =  <dig> to  <dig>  we show this tree in figure  <dig>  the trees for k =  <dig> and  <dig> are similar to but a little bit inferior to the tree for k =  <dig>  the bootstrap consensus trees for the four big groups   provide branch statistics for the tree in figure  <dig>  for the trees of  <dig> parvoviruses based on all protein sequences, the trees for k =  <dig> and  <dig> are topologically identical, and are the best trees among the cases of k =  <dig> to  <dig>  we show the tree for k =  <dig> in figure  <dig>  the tree for k =  <dig> is similar to but a little bit worse than the trees for k =  <dig> and  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the bootstrap consensus tree of figure  <dig>  the distance matrices generated from our analyses are available from the first author via email yuzg1970@yahoo.com. we found that the dl method  <cit>  and the modified dl method  <cit>  give trees of the same topology for the same k for both data sets.

as given in figure  <dig>  despite numerous horizontal gene transfers among large dsdna viruses  <cit> , our analysis can divide the  <dig> dsdna viruses into nine families correctly. our phylogenetic relationships of all  <dig> large dsdna viruses are in good agreement with the latest classification in the viiith report of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses   <cit> . in the family adenoviridae, figures  <dig> and 2a support the division of this family into four genera atadenovirus, aviadenovirus, mastadenovirus and siadenovirus. all viruses in these four genera are grouped correctly. the topology of phylogeny for these four genera is identical to that shown in figure one of  <cit>  which supports the hypothesis that interspecies transmission, i.e. host switches of adenoviruses, may have occurred  <cit> . in figures  <dig> and 2b, the family baculoviridae is divided into two genera granulovirus and nucleopolyhedrovirus. all viruses in these two genera are classified correctly. the unclassified virus nelenpv in this family groups with nesenpv which belongs to genus nucleopolyhedrovirus. so our result supports grouping virus nelenpv to genus nucleopolyhedrovirus. another unclassified virus cuninpv is located at the basal position of this family, as reported by herniou et al  <cit> , with the hymenoptera baculoviruses  and lepidoptera baculoviruses  grouped together, as reported by herniou et al  <cit>  and zanotto et al  <cit> . thus the classification of cuninpv is still unresolved in our analysis. the division of the family poxviridae into two subfamilies chordopoxvirinae and entomopoxvirinae shown in figures  <dig> and 2d is the same as in the viiith report of ictv. in the subfamily chordopoxvirinae, the viruses in the genera avipoxvirus, capripoxvirus, leporipoxvirus, molluscipoxvirus, orthopoxvirus, parapoxvirus, suipoxvirus and yatapoxvirus group together correctly. the unclassified virus dpv is closely related to the genera capripoxvirus and suipoxvirus, so that our result supports assigning the virus dpv to the subfamily chordopoxvirinae, in agreement with the results in  <cit>  and  <cit> . in the subfamily entomopoxvirinae, the viruses in genus betaentomopoxvirus group together as expected. the division of the family herpesviridae into subfamilies alphaherpesvirinae, gammaherpesvirinae and betaherpesvirinae is clear. all viruses in the genera within each subfamily are grouped correctly in figures  <dig> and 2c. consistent with the result of  <cit> , our tree supports assigning the unclassified virus tuhv_ <dig> in the subfamily betaherpesvirinae to genus cytomegalovirus. the unclassified herpesviridae virus oshv_ <dig> groups with ichv_ <dig> indicating that we can assign it to the genus ictalurivirus. the unclassified herpesviridae virus pshv_ <dig> groups with gahv_ <dig>  suggesting its affiliation to the genus iltovirus. the unclassified herpesviridae virus athv_ <dig> nests inside the branch of genus rhadinovirus, which indicates we can assign it to the genus rhadinovirus. all viruses in the family iridoviridae fall into their genera correctly in figure  <dig>  the grouping of the unclassified virus hzv_ <dig> with wssv indicates its affiliation to the genus whispovirus in the family nimaviridae. the viruses in family phycodnaviridae group together as expected. the virus apmiv of the genus mimivirus but with no family affiliation nests within the family phycodnaviridae suggests classification of the genus to this family. the viruses in the family polydnaviridae cluster together correctly. as claimed by gao and qi  <cit> , our results could also provide some clues to the hypotheses on the origins and evolution of viruses of several families. overall, the topology of our tree is similar to that of the tree in  <cit>  and our tree is slightly better because the tree in  <cit> has  <dig> outliers  while ours has no outlier. although the results using feature frequency profiles  on a slightly larger data set showed the ffp method can also resolve the phylogeny of large dsdna viruses  <cit> , the optimal feature length for ffp method is  <dig> implying that much longer computing time and larger computer space are needed as compared to our method with an optimal feature length of  <dig> 

as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  our analyses showed that the parvovirus genomes are separated into two major groups, with one group corresponding to the subfamily parvovirinae and the other group corresponding to the subfamily densovirinae. in the parvovirinae group, the parvoviruses in the genera parvovirus, erythrovirus, dependovirus, amdovirus and bocavirus group together as subgroups respectively. in the densovirinae group, the parvoviruses in the genera densovirus, iteravirus and brevidensovirus cluster together as subgroups correctly. all the groups and subgroups shown in figure  <dig> using our method agree well with the latest classification of parvoviruses given in the viiith report of ictv  <cit>  except pfdnv. pfdnv was classified into the brevidensovirus in the viith report of the ictv  <cit>  and reclassified into pefudensovirus in the viiith report of ictv  <cit> . after the comparison on the genome structure, coding protein sequence homology, dna sequence homology, 3-dimensional structure  <cit>  between pfdnv and other parvoviruses, li et al  <cit>  claimed that it would be more appropriate to classify pfdnv as densovirus rather than brevidensovirus. thus the grouping of pfdnv with densoviru in our tree  provides another piece of evidence for classifying pfdnv as densovirus. amdovirus and bocavirus are newly defined genera in the subfamily parvoririnae in the viiith report of ictv  <cit> . in the viith report of ictv  <cit> , the parvoviruses  in these two new genera were grouped under parvovirus. their close relationship is also reflected in our trees  in which amdovirus and bocavirus cluster with parvovirus as a separate branch. the parvoviruses aav <dig>  aav <dig>  aaava, bpv <dig>  mpv, addnv and cednv are still not classified in the viiith report of ictv  <cit> . in our previous study  <cit> , the dl method applied to the analysis of  <dig> prokaryotes and six eukaryotes has yielded trees separating the three domains of life, archaea, eubacteria and eukarya with the relationships among the taxa in good agreement with those based on traditional analyses. it has also been applied in analyzing the chloroplast genomes  <cit>  to give reliable phylogenies of plants and algae. from the above discussion, it is clear that this method can successfully resolve the phylogeny of parvoviruses. the positions of aav <dig>  aav <dig>  aaava, bpv <dig>  mpv, addnv and cednv in figure  <dig> provide new insights on their classification.

it is very interesting to note the assumption that small dna viruses  probably have different evolutionary history as compared to large dna viruses  <cit> . our analyses showed that the dl method can be used to reconstruct the phylogeny of viruses with large difference in genome size . we also generated all the trees of the same k values based on the three kinds of sequences for the parvovirus data set  <dig> using the cv tree method  <cit> . yet no tree generated by the cv tree method can clearly distinguish the subfamilies parvovirinae and densovirinae of parvoviruses. so for the data set of parvoviruses, the dl method is superior  to the cv tree method in phylogenetic inference.

our approach is faster than the traditional approaches of phylogenetic analysis, particularly when dealing with a large number of genomes. moreover, since multiple sequence alignment is not necessary, the intrinsic problems associated with this complex procedure can be avoided. our method may provide a quick reference on virus phylogeny and a fast analysis of co-evolution of viruses and their hosts when their proteomes are available  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using the dl method, we have studied the molecular phylogeny between families of large dsdna viruses and parvoviruses. the present method provides a new way for recovering the phylogeny of large dsdna viruses and parvoviruses, and also insights on the affiliation of some unclassified viruses and relationships among some families. it appears that some alignment-free methods such as the cv tree method  <cit>  can be used for recovering the phylogeny of large dsdna viruses, but they are not suitable for parvoviruses with a much smaller genome size.
