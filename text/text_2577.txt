BACKGROUND
cucumber is an important vegetable crop and is widely cultivated in the world with total harvest of more than two million hectares in  <dig>  ranking 4th in quantity of world vegetable production . powdery mildew , mainly caused by podosphaera fusca  <cit> , is among the most destructive fungal diseases amongst cucurbitaceae family crops including cucumber, melon, watermelon, pumpkin and squash . because cucumbers are grown year-round in greenhouses or high tunnels, pm finds such sheltered conditions favorable, has had a profound impact on the cucumber industry  <cit> . the typical symptoms of the disease are decline in leaf photosynthetic capacity and reduction in fruit quality  <cit> . in most cucumber production areas, fungicide application is the major method of pm disease control  <cit> . in the european union, over  <dig>  tons of fungicides are applied annually to control pm, which corresponds to about 67% of the total fungicides used for all crops  <cit> . however, excessive fungicide use will not only increase selection pressure on pm pathogen populations to adapt increasing levels of fungicide resistance, but it also detrimental to human health and the environment  <cit> . thus, development of cucumber cultivars with enhanced tolerance to pm is a favored strategy for pm disease control.

a prerequisite for crop improvement is a better understanding of the molecular defense mechanisms involved in disease resistance. quantitative trait loci  associated with pm resistance have been mapped to six cucumber chromosomes . although these findings have provided insights into the genetic control of cucumber pm resistance, the molecular defense mechanisms of host resistance against cucumber pm remain elusive. genetic and physiological plasticity allow plants to adapt to a changing environment, but such plasticity requires sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to simultaneously alter the expression of various genes  <cit> . comparative transcriptomic analysis is, therefore, necessary for the interpretation of the functional elements of the host genome and extending our understanding of disease development  <cit> . transcriptome profiling of immune responses in plants, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and grape  <cit> , have significantly increased the understanding of the molecular-genetic basis of host resistance in the context of pm infection. xin et al.  <cit>  reported that a wide range of pathways were initiated following pm inoculation such as cell wall fortification, flavonoid biosynthesis, and metabolic processes. more recently, rna-seq was used to identify genes whose expression correlated with pm resistance in a panel of two wild and five cultivated central asian grape accessions. this revealed that resistant accessions were characterized by an early up-regulation of  <dig> genes, most encoding putative defense functions  <cit> . little work has been done, however, to study the transcriptomic responses of cucumber to pm on a genomic scale.

segment substitution lines  are very powerful resources that can be used for genetic dissection of qtls, functional genomics studies and molecular breeding, and they have been applied by plant biologists too explore the genetics of many crops  <cit> . with high level genetic background uniformity except at the substituted segment, all the phenotypic variations between ssls and the recurrent parent are ostensibly caused by the substituted segment. we thus developed a series of ssls with different pm resistances introgressed from pm tolerant donor jin5- <dig> in the genetic background of pm susceptible d <dig> by marker-assisted selection with sequence characterized amplified regions  markers and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . after eleven generations maker-aided backcrossing with d <dig>  one such ssl, namely ssl508- <dig>  exhibited high resistance to pm. transcriptome analysis of ssl508- <dig> during pm infection will illuminate genes and gene pathways related to pm resistance, and help identify candidate pm-resitance genes that can be used to more efficiently produce pm-resistance cucumber cultivars. in this study, whole genome resequencing of ssl508- <dig> and its donor parents jin5- <dig> and d <dig> was performed to identify the exact boundaries of the breakpoints for the introgression of pm resistance. rna-seq of the leaves of ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> after 48 h of pm inoculation, along with uninfected control leaves from each, was used to identify differentially expressed genes  and uncover the candidate genes that may be underlying cucumber pm resistance.

RESULTS
performance of powdery mildew resistance
there were no visible differences between ssl508- <dig> and the recurrent parent d <dig> in terms of plant morphology and plant height, except that ssl508- <dig> was highly resistant to pm . the disease index  for d <dig> after 15 days of pm pathogen inoculation was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. under the same environmental conditions, ssl508- <dig> showed consistent higher resistance to pm with dis of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  over the 3 years. to better describe the resistant phenotype difference of ssl508- <dig> and d <dig>  fungal growth was cytological assessed 48 h after inoculation with pm pathogen. no conidium was detected in either of the control lines . microscopic observation showed no hyphal network and the appearance of only one conidium peduncles  on the leaves of ssl508- <dig>  whereas a dense hyphal network with a relatively high number of spore-containing cp formed on the leaves of d <dig> . these results suggest that differences in the resistance mechanisms may contribute to the different phenotypes of ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> fig.  <dig> morphology and powdery mildew  natural infestation responses of d <dig> , jin5- <dig> , and the derived chromosome segment introgression line , named segment substitution line ssl <dig>  , after ssr markers identification

molecular delimitation of substituted segment length in ssl508-28
the introgressed fragment in ssl508- <dig> was delimited by two ssr markers, ssr <dig> and ssr <dig>  but the exact boundaries of the breakpoints for this introgression were not known because of the limited number, and low density of available ssr markers in cultivated cucumbers. to more precisely estimate the length of the introgressed fragment, whole-genome resequencing of ssl508- <dig>  recurrent parent d <dig>  and donor parent jin5- <dig> was performed to identify high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions and deletions . a total of  <dig>  million,  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million paired-end reads were obtained for ssl508- <dig>  d <dig>  and jin5- <dig>  respectively. the average sequence depth was 36-fold in ssl508- <dig>  31-fold in d <dig>  and 21-fold in jin5- <dig> . a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps, as well as  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels were identified in ssl508- <dig>  d <dig>  and jin5- <dig>  respectively, by comparing each individually with the cucumber  <dig> reference genome assembly.  <dig> , and  <dig>  snps, as well as  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels, were identified in ssl508- <dig>  d <dig>  respectively, by comparing each individually with jin5- <dig>  in contrast, only  <dig>  snps, and  <dig>  indels were identified between ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> . between ssl508- <dig> and d <dig>  a total of  <dig> snps were non-synonymous mutations in  <dig> genes, and  <dig> indels were present in exonic regions of  <dig> genes. of these, four genes were found to have both snps and indels in their exonic regions . approximately 94%, or  <dig>  of these genes were located on chromosome five, which strongly suggests a segment introgression in chromosome five of ssl508- <dig>  with the remaining genetic background being almost identical to d <dig> table  <dig> summary of whole-genome resequencing data of ssl508- <dig>  d <dig> and jin5-508






to examine the location of the introgressed segment in ssl508- <dig> in detail, genotype percentages of snps and indels in ssl508- <dig> from donor parent jin5- <dig> and recurrent parent d <dig> were calculated along the chromosomes in 100 kb sliding windows . screening removed homozygous snps and indels between jin5- <dig> and d <dig> with less than 5-fold read depths. interestingly, one region on chromosome five was identified as the introgressed segment by examining the genotype percentages of snps. the region that we named pm <dig>  spanned  <dig>  mb  and contained  <dig> snps. there were two regions on chromosome five that were identified as introgressed segments by examining the genotype percentages of indels, one segment spanned  <dig>  mb  and contained  <dig> indels, the other spanned  <dig>  mb  and contained  <dig> indels. the segments identified using the indels fell within the segment identified using the snps, suggesting that the  <dig>  mb segment represents the exact boundaries of the breakpoints for this introgression. the introgressed segment pm <dig>  contains  <dig> genes.fig.  <dig> circos plot representing the location of the introgressed segment. the outer ring represents the seven cucumber chromosomes. the scatter plot inside this ring shows the distribution of homozygous snps and indels between jin5- <dig> and d <dig> across the cucumber chromosomes, snp: green; indel: purple. the green line represents the genotype percentage of snps in ssl508- <dig> from the donor parent jin5- <dig> along the chromosomes; the inner blue line represents the genotype percentage of indels in ssl508- <dig> from the donor parent jin5- <dig> along the chromosomes




transcriptome profile based on rna-seq in ssl508- <dig> and d8
to identify pm responsive genes in ssl508- <dig> and d <dig>  the transcriptomes of normally watered control leaves and leaves inoculated with pm for 48 h from these two lines were characterized using rna-seq. a total of  <dig> standard illumina cdna libraries, including three biological replicates for each line at each stage, were prepared for rna-seq. after removing the adaptor-containing, unknown , and low-quality reads, a total of approximately  <dig> million paired-end reads were obtained, with an average of  <dig>  million reads per sample. approximately 87%  of these reads could be uniquely mapped to the cucumber reference genome. the assembled transcripts were further filtered based on expression levels of greater than  <dig> fragments per kilobase million . in total, the expression of  <dig>  transcripts was detected in the  <dig> tested samples. the expressed genes from all  <dig> samples were subjected to a cluster analysis. as shown in fig. 4a, the two genotypes after 48 h of pm inoculation and in the control were separated from each other. the six control samples clustered into one group, and the inoculated samples clustered into another group, suggesting that most of the expressed genes had similar expression patterns in response to pm infection, even in different genotypes. the inoculated d <dig> and ssl508- <dig> clustered into different subgroups, indicating that some gene expression responses to pathogen infection were different.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of expressed cucumber genes. a hierarchical cluster of expressed cucumber genes in  <dig> samples. in the color panels, each vertical line represents a single gene and the color of the line indicates the expression level of the gene relative to the mean center in a specific sample: high expression level in red, low expression level in green. id = inoculated d <dig>  nid = non-inoculated control d <dig>  is = inoculated ssl508- <dig>  nis = non-inoculated control ssl508- <dig> and fpkm = fragments per kilobase million. b venn diagram showing the distribution of differentially expressed genes. ‘id vs nid up’ stands for genes upregulated in d <dig> 48 h after pm inoculation when compared with its un-inoculated control; ‘id vs nid down’ stands for genes downregulated in d <dig> 48 h after pm inoculation when compared with its un-inoculated control. ‘is vs nis up’ stands for genes upregulated in ssl508- <dig> 48 h after pm inoculation when compared with its control; ‘is vs nis down’ stands for genes downregulated in ssl508- <dig> 48 h after pm inoculation when compared with its control. c distribution of differentially expressed genes  on each chromosome of cucumber




the normalized expression levels in uninfected control and pm inoculated plants were compared to detect degs. a total of  <dig> degs, including  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes, were obtained after comparing the pm inoculated d <dig>  leaves to the non-inoculated d <dig>  control leaves . in contrast,  <dig> degs, including  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes, were identified after comparing the inoculated ssl508- <dig>  leaves against the non-inoculated ssl508- <dig> leaves  . seventy six genes were upregulated in id vs nid, but downregulated in is vs nis;  <dig> genes were downregulated in id vs nid but upregulated in is vs nis . the degs distributed in all seven cucumber chromosomes . to confirm the regulation of the identified degs, the expression trends of  <dig> representative genes were evaluated by quantitative real-time pcr  in a separate experiment. the strong correlation  between rna-seq and quantitative real-time pcr expression values indicated that there was a high level of agreement between the approaches .fig.  <dig> comparison of transcription levels measured by rna-sequencing and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr  assays. the gene expression values were transformed to the log <dig> scale. the fragments per kilobase million  fold changes log2-values  were plotted against the qrt-pcr fold changes log2-values . the cucumber β-actin gene  was used as an internal control to normalize the expression data. each value denotes the mean relative level of expression of three biological replicates




functional annotation of degs
of the  <dig> degs identified in the id vs nid pair-wise analysis and the  <dig> degs identified in the is vs nis analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> degs, respectively, were assigned one or more gene ontology  terms. in both cases, all go assignments fell into broad categories for the three major go functional domains . a go term was considered to be significantly enriched if the false discovery rate was below  <dig> . sixty-two significantly different go annotations were obtained for the id vs nid pair with  <dig> belonging to biological processes, six belonging to molecular functions and four belonging to cellular components . in contrast,  <dig> significantly different go terms were obtained for the is vs nis pair with  <dig> belonging to biological processes, nine belonging to molecular functions and seven belonging to cellular components . enrichment analysis of go functions revealed that  <dig> go terms were found shared between the id vs nid and is vs nis degs, such as response to chitin , response to fungus , intracellular signal transduction , respiratory burst involved in defense response , kinase activity , and plant-type cell wall . thirty-two go terms were unique to the is vs nis pair, including detection of biotic stimulus , systemic acquired resistance , salicylic acid biosynthetic process , phosphatidylinositol phosphorylation  and defense response to bacterium . these go terms are normally regarded as being related to disease resistance .fig.  <dig> comparison of selected significant enriched gene ontology terms among differentially expressed genes. the red bar stands for the differentially expressed genes in ssl508- <dig> 48 h after pm inoculation when compared with its control; the blue bar stands for the differentially expressed genes in d <dig> 48 h after pm inoculation when compared with its control. additional file 4: table s <dig> and additional file 5: table s <dig> has a full list of genes and gene ontology analysis




in addition to go term assignment, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway mapping, based on the encyclopedia’s orthology terms for assignments, was also carried out to evaluate the disease-resistance related pathway. twelve significantly enriched pathways, with a false discovery rate of less than  <dig> , related to pm inoculation were identified in the is vs nis pair-wise analysis , and  <dig> significant enriched pathways were identified in the id vs nid pair-wise analysis . among these significantly enriched pathways, seven were common to both pairs, including plant-pathogen interaction , phenylalanine metabolism  and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis . antigen processing and presentation  and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor signaling pathway , normally regarded as disease-resistant related events, are only found in is vs nis pair-wise analysis. these findings suggested a role for these genes in regulating pm resistance mediated by pm <dig> .

degs in the  <dig> -mb introgressed segment
the expression patterns of degs within the introgressed segment pm <dig>  could be used to prioritize candidate causal genes as they often affect phenotypic variation through transcriptional regulation. a total of  <dig> degs within the  <dig> -mb introgressed segment, including  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated, were obtained after comparing the pm inoculated d <dig> leaves to the non-inoculated d <dig> control leaves. in contrast,  <dig> degs, including  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes, were identified after comparing the inoculated ssl508- <dig> leaves against the non-inoculated ssl508- <dig> leaves. shared between two genotypes were eight degs  with significantly increased expression and five degs  with significantly decreased expression. a few genes had opposite regulation, increased expression in one genotype and decreased in another genotype, namely, three degs  with increased expressions in ssl508- <dig> and decreased in d <dig>  and four degs  with decreased expression in ssl508- <dig> and increased expression in d <dig>  degs that fell into the defense response , regulation of reactive oxygen species , systemic acquired resistance , regulation of plant-type hypersensitive response , abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway , and innate immune response  were considered as candidate genes associated with pm resistance in cucumber . no deg within the segment contains non-synonymous snp or indel in its exonic region.table  <dig> list of eight candidate genes in the  <dig> -mb introgressed segment

degs in the whole genome related to protein kinases and mildew locus o  in ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> respond to pm infection
protein kinases play key roles in the early stage of signal recognition and the subsequent activation of plant defense mechanisms during pathogen infection  <cit> . pm infection affected the expression of protein kinases in both cucumber genotypes.  <dig> degs encoding protein kinases were identified in the sensitive genotype d <dig> in response to pm infection;  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . in tolerant genotype ssl508- <dig>  exposed to the same condition,  <dig> degs were found of which  <dig> were up-regulated . four genes, csa5g <dig>  csa6g <dig>  csa6g <dig> and csa7g <dig> showed a peculiar behavior; they were up-regulated in the sensitive genotype d <dig> and dramatically down-regulated in the tolerant genotype ssl508- <dig>  cs5g <dig> and csa6g <dig> encode cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinases ; csa6g <dig> encodes wall-associated receptor protein kinase ; csa7g <dig> encodes inactive leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase .


mlo is a plant-specific gene family, which is known to response to biotic stresses in various plant species. mlo genes have been found to be involved in pm susceptibility, such as wheat  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , pepper  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> . for example, presence of the barley mlo is an absolute requirement for successful penetration of the host cell wall by the corresponding compatible pm  <cit> . two degs encoding mlo proteins were differentially expressed in tolerant genotype ssl508-28: one gene  was up-regulated, the other one  was down-regulated. in the sensitive genotype d <dig> two mlo genes  were found and both of them were up-regulated.

differential expression of transcript factors  in the whole genome of ssl508- <dig> and d8
tfs are dna-binding proteins that control the target gene transcription, and as such play important roles in multiple cellular processes including development, cell cycle regulation, and response to pathogen attacks  <cit> .  <dig> tfs were classified based on their assigned protein families, which accounted for nearly ten percent of the degs analyzed in present study. of these, only  <dig> tfs  were common regulated in ssl508- <dig> and d <dig>  whereas  <dig> tfs  were regulated in ssl508- <dig> only, and  <dig> tfs  were regulated in d <dig> only. remarkly, ap2/erfs , wrky , bhlh  were the most frequently identified tfs . some tfs, such as hsf, hd-zip, bhlh, c2h <dig>  gras, and tify families that have not previously been associated with diseases resistance, were also significantly induced or repressed. in particular, nine gras tfs were found to be dramatically regulated in the tolerant genotype ssl508- <dig> only, and six tify tfs were up-regulated in the sensitive genotype d <dig> only. in this study the wrky tf csa6m <dig>  was found to be upregulated in ssl508- <dig> but down-regulated in d <dig>  numerous studies have indicated that wrky tfs play complicated roles in plant defense signaling. for example, stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing of barley hvwrky <dig>  hvwrky <dig>  and hvwrky <dig> compromised resistance-gene-mediated defense to pm  <cit> . constitutive over-expression of the tawrky <dig> in transgenic wheat conferred enhanced resistance against blumeria graminis   <cit> . these observations implicated the important role of tfs in response to pm infection.fig.  <dig> graphical representation of pm <dig> -regulated transcription factors based on their assigned protein families. ‘common’ represent common regulated degs. ‘up’ and ‘down’ represent up-regulation and down-regulation in this analysis. others transcription factors families include bbr-bpc, csd, nf-yb, arf, bes <dig>  yabby, camta, hb-other, jumonji, pseudo arr-b, snf <dig>  swi/snf-baf60b, zf-hd, hmg, tub, hb-bell, rwp-rk, taz, dbp, far <dig>  garp-arr-b, gebp, grf, platz, sbp. detailed information of these families can be seen form plant transcription factor database v <dig>  




discussions
comparative transcriptomic analysis is useful for exploring genes under selection and elucidating the role of various biological pathways and mechanisms for imparting disease tolerance  <cit> . in the current study, we used a ssl to investigate pm resistance in cucumber. ssl508- <dig> possessed a segment from the pm resistant donor , allowing for more precise detection of the pm responsive genes  <cit> . in pm inoculation tests conducted over 3 years, the resistance of ssl508- <dig> was found to be highly consistent and stable, suggesting that the introgressed fragment truly carried a pm resistant locus. the introgressed segment, pm <dig> , in ssl508- <dig> was delimited by two previously identified polymorphic ssr markers: ssr <dig> and ssr <dig>  <cit> . the exact boundaries of the breakpoints for this introgression and whether there were other minor substituted segments was not, however, known because of the narrow genetic base of cultivated cucumbers and the low density dense of available polymorphic ssr markers in the genome  <cit> . based on deep-coverage whole genome resequencing of ssl <dig>  the donor parent jin5- <dig>  and the recurrent parent d <dig>  we calculated the genotype ratios of snps and indels in ssl <dig> from the donor and recurrent parents along the chromosomes in 100 kb sliding windows . the boundaries of the two introgressed segments calculated using the indels  was shorter than the fragment identified using the snps . this may because of the lower frequency of indels, relative to snps, in the cucumber genome. these results are broadly consistent with our previous work, thus confirming that the phenotypic variation in pm resistance between ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> was triggered by introgression of the ~ <dig>  mb segment rather than by some unknown stochastic factors during the breeding process. the same method may also be useful for the identification of candidate genes in substituted segment boundaries in other studies where the substitute segment is the only potential source of phenotypic variation.

the location of pm <dig>  on chromosome five in this study was consistent with the major locus for pm resistance identified in the previous studies  <cit> , despite these studies using different populations, types of molecular markers, molecular mapping strategies and phenotyping statistical methods. therefore, we are reasonably confident that the location of pm <dig>  identified by ssr and resequencing in our study is correct. nie et al.  <cit>  cloned a recessive inherited candidate gene for the major qtl on cucumber chromosome five and found that the resistance was caused by the insertion of a 1449-dna fragment into an mlo-like gene  in the pm resistant line s <dig>  this mlo-like gene is, however, located in an ~170 kb region between markers uw <dig> and uw <dig>  that is not in the interval of the  <dig>  mb segment. most importantly, unlike the enhanced expression of csa5g <dig> in s <dig> upon pm inoculation  <cit> , its expression was significantly down-regulated in ssl508- <dig>  after inoculation, indicating the pm defense mechanism in ssl508- <dig> is different from that reported by nie et al.  <cit> . microscopic observation showed a relatively high numbers of spore-containing cp on the leaves of d <dig>  while the disease symptoms of ssl508- <dig> were much weaker than those of d <dig>  with only one cp observed 48 h after pm inoculation . this indicates that some of the genes differentially expressed between ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> after 48 h of pm infection might be the causal gene underling pm <dig> .


although it is still hard to determine which deg is the truly causal genetic factor governing pm <dig> , whole-transcriptome sequencing approaches have already provided a narrow pool of candidates for our further investigation. go annotations revealed that eight degs might be the candidates for pm <dig>  locus from the  <dig> genes in the  <dig>  mb pm <dig>  substituted segment . of particular interest within the  <dig> degs were two tandemly arrayed receptor protein kinases  that fell into go term ‘systemic acquired resistance’, a gras tf  that fell in to go term ‘regulation of reactive oxygen species’ and a nac tf  that fell into go term ‘innate immune response’. during the interaction with microorganisms, rpks active innate immune responses to pathogen attack in plants  <cit> . in our rna-seq data, csa5g <dig> was up-regulated in ssl508- <dig> , whereas down-regulated in d <dig> , suggesting that csa5g <dig> might function as a positive regulator of pm resistance in cucumber. unlike csa5g <dig>  the other rpk csa5g <dig> was down-regulated in ssl508- <dig> , suggesting distinct functions for these two genes in pm responses. similar expression pattern divergences of rpks were also observed in arabidopsis leaves during downy mildew pathogen infection  <cit>  and in wheat during stripe rust fungus inoculation  <cit> . the gras family tf was upregulated ~ <dig> -fold in ssl508- <dig>  suppression of gras <dig> expression impaired tomato resistance to p. syringae pv. tomato  <cit> . in addition, tobacco gras homologues were reported to be induced upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, which is well known for its involvement in plant defense responses  <cit> . the nac family tf was upregulated ~ <dig> -fold in d <dig>  a previous study revealed that nac genes regulated defence response against pathogens by downstream activation or suppression of pathogenesis-related genes. a mutant allele of nac gene ataf <dig> was found to compromises penetration resistance in arabidopsis against blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei  <cit> . however, transgenic plants in which ataf <dig> was overexpressed showed enhanced susceptibility to p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  botrytis cinerea, and alternaria brassicicola, and the ataf <dig> mutant plants showed no significant resistance against the pathogens tested  <cit> . the candidate gene list contains a gene encoding p-type atpase , which was predicted to associate with plant-type hypersensitive response  by go annotation. pathogen recognition in plants leads to inhibition of pathogen growth, which is often accompanied in plants by the hrs, a kind of programmed cell death  localized at the site of attempted pathogen invasion  <cit> . the p-type atpase activities in plant cells are closely related to ion homeostasis, apoplastic ph and membrane integrity  <cit> . thus, we inferred that the up-regulation of csa5g <dig>  in ssl508- <dig> might contribute to the pm resistance by a rapid pcd of the infected leave cells. targeted gene replacement showed that the rice p-type atpase-encoding gene, mgapt <dig>  is required for rice blast pathogen infection, and for the rapid induction of host defense responses  <cit> . additionally, csa5g <dig> and csa5g <dig> were also important candidates, and both ostensibly coding for remorin family proteins. precise biological roles of this family remain to be investigated, but gene expressions data suggest that these proteins might play important functions during responses to biotic stimuli and might be involved in abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway  <cit> . rapid induction of atrem <dig> , atrem <dig> , and atrem <dig>  transcripts were observed in arabidopsis upon pm infection, suggesting that possible roles in early stages of plant-microbe interactions. apart from the genes discussed above, csa5g <dig> encoding a 70 kda heat shock protein  might also be a candidate gene. hsp play roles in both compatibility and resistance processes  <cit> , but specific role in pathogen attack is still not clear. transcriptomic studies on barley leaf revealed that a 70 kda hsp was also significantly induced 12 h after pm inoculation  <cit> .

the comparative transcriptome profiling of ssl508- <dig> and its recurrent parent d <dig> here also provided several interesting insights into the molecular defense mechanisms trigged by pm <dig> . first, nearly 20% of degs encoded for protein kinases and tfs, implying that signal regulation or transduction might play important roles in pm <dig> -regulated pm defense. crks can regulate immune system as positive or negative regulators in reactive oxygen species/redox signaling and sensing  <cit> ; wrks allow host cells to perceive their extracellular environment  <cit> ; lrrs contribute to the recognition of diverse pathogen-derived ligands  <cit> ; the mitogen-activated protein kinase  may contribute to recognition of invading pathogens by the host leading to rapid activation of a network of mapk signals transductors, and subsequently resulting in the release of defense compounds, such as phytoalexin  <cit> . for example, three genes encoding mapks  were up-regulated in ssl508- <dig> , whereas only one mapk  was upregulated in d <dig> . these crk, wrk, lrrs, mapk and tfs signaling cascades occur rapidly after the recognition of effectors by corresponding r proteins in the host and are followed by downstream activation of the defense system. the differential expression of these genes between the ssl508- <dig> and d <dig> might, therefore, lead to different reactions to the pm disease. second, the resistance mediated by pm <dig>  might be closely related to cell wall modifications. as the first barrier against pathogen attack, the plant cell wall reacts to localized stress by directly apposing substances onto the inner surface. it has been suggested that cell wall modifications elicited by invading pathogens may represent a disease resistance mechanism  <cit> . syntaxin is involved in cell wall fortification and can greatly enhance pm resistance in nicotiana benthamiana  <cit>  our analysis showed that csa2g <dig> encoding the syntaxin protein was specifically upregulated  in ssl508- <dig> after pm inoculation . conversely, several genes encoding cellulase and pectinesterase, such as csa3g <dig>  csa7g <dig> and csa7g <dig>  which facilitate plant cell wall breakdown, were upregulated in d <dig> to a greater extent than in ssl508- <dig>  we, therefore, propose that increased expression of positive cell wall-related genes might reinforce cucumber resistance to pm, and that negative proteins would play an opposing role. third, the pm resistance mediated by pm <dig>  might also relate to salicylic acid  signaling pathway. it is believed that plant resistance to biotrophic pathogenesis, including pm, is controlled largely by a type of induced resistance called ‘systemic acquired resistance’ that requires the activation of the sa signaling pathway  <cit> . in arabidopsis, systemic acquired resistance through the sa pathway and expression of defense genes have been shown to occur in the plants infected with pm. mutation of the sa induction-deficient2- <dig>  gene yields mutants that fail to accumulate sa and show increased susceptibility to the pm pathogen  <cit> . interestingly, eight degs enriched in sa biosynthesis in go:  <dig> were specially regulated in ssl508- <dig> . therefore, we propose that the biosynthesis of sa in the early stages of pm infection might also contribute to host defense against the pathogen on ssl508- <dig> leaves.

CONCLUSIONS
with this work we initiated a next generation sequencing based approach to characterize the exact boundaries of the breakpoints for the cucumber pm resistant introgressed segment pm <dig> . the comparative rna-seq based transcriptomes allow us identify eight potential candidate genes that underlie the pm <dig>  and a complex regulatory network for pm <dig>  and mediated pm defense mechanisms which included several signal regulators or transducers, cell wall modifications and salicylic acid signaling pathway.
