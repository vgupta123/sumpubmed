BACKGROUND
hect domain and ankyrin repeat containing e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase  <dig>  was identified as a gene located in an affected region of chromosome 6q <dig> in human wilms’ tumor  <cit> . it has been shown that hace <dig> expression is reduced in multiple human tumors, and forced expression of hace <dig> in human tumor cell lines inhibits cell growth in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . moreover, hace1−/− mice develop spontaneous late-onset cancer  <cit> . therefore, hace <dig> is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene. hace <dig> protein is a hect family e <dig> ligase and is known to regulate multiple cellular processes. the most investigated target of hace <dig> is rac <dig>  hace <dig> specifically recognizes gtp-bound rac <dig>  an active form of rac <dig>  and promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> . rac <dig> degradation by hace <dig> is important in regulating cell migration and reactive oxygen species  production  <cit> . in addition, rab gtpases are binding partners of hace <dig>  <cit> . hace <dig> regulates golgi membrane dynamics during the cell cycle by interacting with rab proteins  <cit> . one rab gtpase rab11a is activated by hace1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequently promotes recycling of the β2-adrenergic receptor  <cit> . in addition, hace <dig> has protective actions against oxidative stress in the brain and hemodynamic stress in the heart  <cit> . thus, these findings have demonstrated hace <dig> functions in diverse cellular processes. however, the roles of hace <dig> during vertebrate embryonic development have not been previously reported in any model organism.

here, we show that xenopus laevis hace <dig> is mainly expressed in the ectoderm and plays an important role in embryonic development. hace1-depleted xenopus laevis embryos displayed defects in multiple developmental processes. analysis with keller sandwich explants revealed that xenopus laevis hace <dig> is essential for convergent extension.

RESULTS
xenopus laevis hace <dig> is mainly expressed in the ectoderm during early embryogenesis
to investigate a role of hace <dig> in early embryonic development, we first cloned a xenopus laevis hace <dig> homolog  with a 2739 bp open reading frame. compared with the reported sequence of xenopus laevis hace <dig> in genbank , the xenopus laevis hace <dig> sequence that we obtained had five silent point mutations and a 96 bp deletion. these silent mutations may be single nucleotide polymorphisms. the 96 bp deletion may be caused by alternative splicing, because the human hace <dig> gene deposited in genbank  has a similar deletion. we thus concluded that the obtained xenopus laevis hace <dig> clone is a splicing variant. human hace <dig> protein shares 90 % and 87 % amino acid identity with our xenopus laevis hace <dig> protein and the previously reported protein, respectively. hence, we used our clone in this study.

whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed to determine the expression pattern of xenopus laevis hace <dig>  maternal transcripts of hace <dig> were localized to the animal region . the expression was high in the presumptive ectoderm at the gastrula stage . at the neurula stage, hace <dig> was weakly expressed in the dorsal ectoderm . at the early tailbud stage, hace <dig> showed a spotty expression pattern in the epidermis and a uniform expression pattern in the neural tube . at the late tailbud stage, hace <dig> was expressed in the brain, eye, neural tube, branchial arch, ear vesicle, and kidney .fig.  <dig> spatial expression of xenopus laevis hace <dig> in early development. expression of hace <dig> during xenopus laevis development was analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization using an antisense probe  and sense probe as a control . a, b at stage  <dig>  and  <dig> , hace <dig> was expressed throughout the presumptive ectoderm. c at stage  <dig>  hace <dig> expression was weakly detected at the dorsal ectoderm. d at stage  <dig>  hace <dig> was expressed in the neural tissue and also showed spotty expression in the epidermis. the rightmost panel shows a magnification of the red boxed region. e

knockdown of hace <dig> causes shortening of the body axis and inhibition of eye and pigment formation
we next performed knockdown experiments in developing xenopus laevis embryos by using an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide against hace <dig> . we designed hace <dig> mo to target the sequence containing the translation initiation aug of hace <dig> mrna. to evaluate the specificity and efficiency of hace <dig> mo, we performed immunoblotting analysis. hace <dig> mo blocked the translation of c-terminally myc-tagged hace <dig>  mrna containing the hace <dig> mo target sequence . we then injected hace <dig> mo into the animal region of dorsal or ventral blastomeres at the 4-cell stage and observed the embryos at the tadpole stage . embryos that were dorsally injected with hace <dig> mo displayed a number of defects, including a shortened body axis, a reduction of pigments, and a reduction of eye size , whereas embryos that were ventrally injected with hace <dig> mo exhibited no significant phenotype . according to the extent of each defect, we classified embryos into three groups: severe, mild, and normal . coinjection of hace <dig> mo and n-terminally myc-tagged hace <dig>  mrna, which was mo-resistant because of the insertion of two myc tags near the mo recognition site , resulted in milder defects than the injection of hace <dig> mo alone , indicating that the phenotypes observed in the hace <dig> mo-injected embryos were primarily caused by hace <dig> depletion. thus, these results suggest that hace <dig> has an important role in early xenopus laevis embryonic development.fig.  <dig> dorsal depletion of hace <dig> leads to multiple developmental defects. a immunoblot analysis shows that hace <dig> mo inhibited translation of hace1-myc mrna but not that of myc-hace <dig> mrna used for rescue experiments. xenopus laevis embryos were injected with the indicated sets of mos  and mrnas . α-tubulin was a loading control. b embryos were injected with 30 ng of hace <dig> mo alone  or 30 ng of hace <dig> mo plus  <dig>  ng of myc-hace <dig> mrna  into the animal region of two dorsal blastomeres at the four-cell stage. c, d embryos were classified into severe, mild, and normal groups on the basis of the extent of each defect. *p <  <dig>  , mann–whitney u-test. c

hace <dig> is required for convergent extension
in early xenopus laevis development, dorsal mesodermal and ectodermal cells converge toward the midline and mediolaterally intercalate, and this process, called convergent extension, leads to elongation of the anterior-posterior body axis  <cit> . therefore, it can be hypothesized that the shortened body axis observed in hace <dig> knockdown embryos is caused by aberrant convergent extension. to test whether hace <dig> regulates convergent extension, we used keller sandwich explants, in which convergent extension can be reproduced in culture  <cit> . explants from embryos injected with control mo  elongated normally, whereas those from embryos injected with hace <dig> mo displayed little elongation . the inhibition of elongation by hace <dig> mo was rescued by coinjection of myc-hace <dig> mrna . to evaluate the elongation of explants, we measured the length-to-width ratio of explants. the length-to-width ratio was significantly reduced by hace <dig> mo, and this reduction was significantly rescued by coinjection of myc-hace <dig> mrna . these results suggest that hace <dig> regulates convergent extension.fig.  <dig> 
hace <dig> knockdown inhibits convergent extension. a keller sandwich explants were prepared from embryos injected with 30 ng of control mo or hace <dig> mo into dorsal blastomeres at the four-cell stage. hace <dig> mo , but not control mo , caused a defect in elongation of explants. the defect in elongation caused by hace <dig> mo was partly rescued by coinjection of  <dig>  ng of myc-hace <dig> mrna . b the length-to-width ratio of explants was quantified. values are expressed as the mean ± s.d. *p <  <dig> , unpaired t-test



hace <dig> depletion causes a delay in neural tube closure
because hace <dig> mo inhibited convergent extension in keller sandwich explants, we examined the effect of hace <dig> mo on gastrulation and neural tube closure, which are two major morphological events involving convergent extension, in whole embryos. an injection of 30 ng of hace <dig> mo did not lead to an apparent defect in gastrulation , but it led to a delay in neural tube closure at the neurula stage . to examine this phenotype in detail, we performed time-lapse imaging of neurulating embryos. at the 4-cell stage, hace <dig> mo was injected into the right dorsal blastomere, and control mo was injected into the left dorsal blastomere . as a control, uninjected embryos were also observed . embryos at stage  <dig> were placed on a culture dish, and images were collected every 5 minutes until neural tube closure was completed . the neural plate was likely to be formed in the hace <dig> mo-injected right side . however, the elevation of the neural fold was much less apparent in the hace <dig> mo-injected side than in the control mo-injected side . although the neural fold became visible at  <dig> to 60 min in the hace <dig> mo-injected right side, the ridge of the neural fold in the right side was much less prominent than that in the control mo-injected left side . we measured the maximum distance between the dorsal midline and the inner edge of the neural folds. in uninjected embryos, the distance in the right side was roughly equal to that in the left side . however, the distance in the hace <dig> mo-injected right side was markedly longer than that in the control mo-injected left side , thus indicating that knockdown of hace <dig> led to a significant delay in neural tube closure. these results suggest that hace <dig> is required for normal neural tube closure.fig.  <dig> knockdown of hace <dig> and overexpression of rac1-v <dig> cause a delay in neural tube closure. a embryos were injected with the indicated mos  into the animal region of two dorsal blastomeres at the four-cell stage and the images were collected at stage  <dig>  anterior views with dorsal to the top. representative results from two independent experiments are shown. b hace <dig> mo  was injected into the animal region of the right dorsal blastomere, and control mo  was subsequently injected into that of the left dorsal blastomere. rac1-v <dig>  mrna  and gfp mrna  were injected into the animal region of the right dorsal blastomere, and then gfp mrna alone was injected into the animal region of the left dorsal blastomere. embryos at stage  <dig> were placed on a culture dish, and images were collected every 5 min until embryos completed neural tube closure. still frames from a time-lapse movie show embryos from stage  <dig>  to stage  <dig> . dorsal views with anterior to the top. dotted lines indicate the midline. transient posterior protrusion  was sometimes observed because embryos were firmly embedded in the agarose groove and thus were constantly subjected to the lateral-to-medial force. c a magnified view of embryos in b . black dotted lines indicate the inner edges of neural folds. d the maximum distance between the dorsal midline and the left  or right  inner edge of the neural fold was measured . the differences  minus ) were then calculated and plotted . long central bar marks mean and upper and lower bars mark s.d. *p <  <dig> , **p< <dig> , mann–whitney u-test

phenotypes of hace <dig> morphants are specific for loss of hace1
knockdown by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides may be accompanied by off-target effects  <cit> . although we performed rescue experiments , we further evaluated the specificity of hace <dig> knockdown. we designed hace <dig> mo <dig> as a second non-overlapping morpholino oligo for hace <dig>  whereas hace <dig> mo targets a region from − <dig> to + <dig> from the translational start site, hace <dig> mo <dig> targets a region from − <dig> to − <dig> from the translational start site. embryos dorsally injected with hace <dig> mo <dig> displayed a shortened body axis, a reduction of pigments, and a reduction of eye size . we next examined the effect of hace <dig> mo <dig> at an early developmental stage. similarly to the results from the injection of hace <dig> mo, the injection of hace <dig> mo <dig> did not lead to an apparent defect in gastrulation , but it did lead to a delay in neural tube closure at the neurula stage . thus, knockdown of hace <dig> by hace <dig> mo <dig> led to essentially the same phenotype as that by hace <dig> mo. these results further confirmed the specificity of morpholino-mediated knockdown of hace <dig> fig.  <dig> knockdown of hace <dig> by hace <dig> mo <dig> leads to a phenotype similar to that caused by hace <dig> mo treatment. a embryos were injected with 50 ng of control mo  or 50 ng of hace <dig> mo <dig>  into dorsal blastomeres at the four-cell stage and fixed at stage 38/ <dig>  representative results from two independent experiments are shown   embryos were classified into severe, mild, and normal groups on the basis of the extent of each defect. b

developmental defects in hace <dig> morphants are largely caused by an excess of active rac1
hace <dig> ubiquitinates gtp-bound rac <dig> and causes its degradation  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the phenotype of hace <dig> morphants is caused by an increase in active rac <dig>  to investigate the relationship between hace <dig> and rac, we first attempted to analyze the expression pattern of the rac family genes: rac <dig>  rac <dig> and rac <dig>  it has previously been shown that xenopus laevis rac <dig> is expressed in neural tissues at the neurula and tailbud stages  <cit> . our qrt-pcr analysis showed that rac <dig> is expressed throughout early development, and rac <dig> expression starts from the early tailbud stage . the full-length coding sequence of xenopus laevis rac <dig> has not been deposited in genbank, and we were unable to find xenopus laevis est sequences corresponding to rac <dig>  in addition, we were unable to amplify any dna fragments from xenopus laevis embryos in our rt-pcr experiments using primers that were designed on the basis of the rac <dig> sequence from the closely related species xenopus  tropicalis, thus suggesting that rac <dig> may be absent or weakly expressed in xenopus laevis embryos. these results indicate that rac <dig> is predominantly expressed among rac family members at the neurula stage. thus, it is possible that hace <dig> targets rac <dig> in xenopus laevis neurulation.fig.  <dig> defects in hace <dig> morphants are partly rescued by coinjection of rac <dig> mo. a temporal expression patterns of xenopus laevis rac <dig> and rac <dig>  the expression levels of rac <dig> and rac <dig> were analyzed by qrt-pcr. expression levels were normalized to those of xenopus laevis ornithine decarboxylase  <dig> . b immunoblot analysis shows that rac <dig> mo inhibited translation of endogenous rac <dig>  xenopus laevis embryos were injected with the indicated mos  and gfp mrna . α-tubulin was a loading control. c coinjection of rac <dig> mo  and hace <dig> mo  led to milder developmental defects than did coinjection of control mo  and hace <dig> mo . anterior is to the left, and dorsal is to the top. d, e embryos were classified into severe, mild, and normal groups on the basis of the extent of each defect. f, g the body length of embryos at stage 40- <dig> was quantified. dorsal views of embryos are shown with anterior to the left. values are expressed as the mean ± s.d. ***p <  <dig> , unpaired t-test h embryos injected with 30 pg of rac1-v <dig>  mrna and 170 pg of gfp mrna displayed phenotypes similar to those of embryos injected with hace <dig> mo . anterior is to the left, and dorsal is to the top



we next asked whether the defects observed in hace <dig> morphants could be rescued by reducing rac <dig> activity. we used rac <dig> mo to reduce the total rac <dig> protein level. immunoblotting analysis confirmed that rac <dig> mo reduced the protein level of endogenous rac <dig> by more than half . we injected hace <dig> mo with control mo or rac <dig> mo into embryos and fixed them at the tadpole stage . embryos coinjected with hace <dig> mo and rac <dig> mo displayed milder defects in eyes and pigments than did embryos coinjected with hace <dig> mo and control mo, although these double mo-injected embryos displayed more severe phenotypes than embryos injected with hace <dig> mo alone, possibly because of overdosing of mos . in addition, embryos coinjected with hace <dig> mo and rac <dig> mo had a longer body length than did embryos coinjected with hace <dig> mo and control mo . these results suggest that the defects in hace <dig> morphants are at least partly caused by an excess of active rac <dig> 

to further test this possibility, we expressed rac1-v <dig>  a constitutively active mutant of rac <dig>  in the presumptive neural plate to examine the effect of excessive active rac <dig> on neurulation. nearly half of the embryos injected with rac1-v <dig> mrna displayed a phenotype similar to that of embryos injected with hace <dig> mo, such as a shortened body axis , thus supporting our idea that developmental defects in hace <dig> knockdown embryos are at least partly due to excessive active rac <dig>  because it has previously been reported that exogenous expression of rac1-v <dig> in the mesoderm  results in gastrulation defects  <cit> , we carefully observed the effect of rac1-v <dig> on gastrulation and showed that injection of rac1-v <dig> mrna in our experimental condition  did not affect gastrulation .

excess of active rac <dig> causes a delay in neural tube closure
to further characterize the phenotype of the embryos injected with rac1-v <dig> mrna, we performed time-lapse imaging and quantified the delay in neural tube closure. embryos in which rac1-v <dig> mrna was injected into the right side showed a significant delay in neural tube closure in the injected side, as compared with uninjected embryos . these results support our hypothesis that hace <dig> regulates xenopus laevis neural tube closure through rac <dig> degradation.

hace <dig> has a role in regulating differentiation to neural ectoderm
although the results shown above suggest that convergent extension is a major process affected by hace <dig> depletion, it is possible that hace <dig> regulates cell fate specification, such as differentiation into the epidermal ectoderm, neural ectoderm, and mesoderm. to test this possibility, we analyzed the expression of marker genes of cell fate specification in hace <dig> depleted embryos. hace <dig> mo was injected into the right side, and control mo was injected into the left side; the expression of marker genes was detected by in situ hybridization. whereas the expression of the epidermal ectoderm marker epidermal keratin and the mesoderm marker xbra were unaffected on the hace <dig> mo-injected side , hace <dig> depletion resulted in a moderate or slight decrease in the expression of the neural ectoderm marker sox <dig> at stage  <dig>  or stage  <dig> , respectively . additionally, the distribution pattern of all of these marker genes was essentially unaffected in hace <dig> mo-injected side. according to the extent of reduction, we classified embryos into four groups: severe, moderate, slight, and normal . these results suggested that hace <dig> is likely to be involved in differentiation to the neural ectoderm. although it is difficult to determine whether this level of decrease in sox <dig> affects the subsequent neural tube closure event, hace <dig> might regulate neural tube closure through controlling differentiation to the neural ectoderm.fig.  <dig> 
hace <dig> has a role in regulating differentiation into neural ectoderm. a–c hace <dig> mo  was injected into the animal region of the right dorsal blastomere, and control mo  was injected into that of the left dorsal blastomere at the 4-cell stage. embryos were fixed at the stages indicated, and expression of epidermal keratin, an epidermal ectoderm marker , sox <dig>  a neural ectoderm marker , and xbra, a mesodermal marker , were analyzed by in situ hybridization. representative images from two independent experiments are shown 



discussion
in this study, we investigated the role of the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase hace <dig> in early embryonic development. we showed that xenopus laevis hace <dig> is expressed in neural tissues and the kidney. high-throughput in situ hybridization in mouse embryos has revealed that hace <dig> is expressed in neural tissues in mice at embryonic day  <dig>  , e <dig> , and postnatal day  <dig>  <cit> . in humans, hace <dig> is expressed in adult tissues including the heart, brain, and kidney  <cit> . these data suggest that hace <dig> expression in neural tissues is common in vertebrates.

hace <dig> depletion in xenopus laevis embryos led to a shortened body axis. the process of body axis elongation is known to involve convergent extension  <cit> . our analysis with keller sandwich explants showed that knockdown of hace <dig> inhibited convergent extension. these results suggest that xenopus laevis hace <dig> may control body axis elongation through regulation of convergent extension. convergent extension occurs in both dorsal mesodermal and posterior neural tissues. whereas convergent extension in the dorsal mesoderm mainly regulates gastrulation, convergent extension in the neural ectoderm mainly regulates neurulation. it has been shown using transplantation experiments that inhibition of convergent extension in only the neural ectoderm leads to a shortened body axis  <cit> . because knockdown of hace <dig> did not affect gastrulation, inhibition of convergent extension in the neural ectoderm by hace <dig> depletion might lead to a shortened body axis.

notably, hace1−/− mice do not display any developmental defects  <cit> , whereas knockdown of hace <dig> in xenopus laevis led to severe developmental defects. this discrepancy might be explained by the possibility that other proteins with roles redundant with that of hace <dig> may compensate for hace <dig> function during embryonic development of hace1−/− mice. for instance, the activity of rac <dig>  one of the targets of hace <dig>  is negatively regulated by gap and other e <dig> ubiquitin ligases targeting rac <dig>  such as iaps . ectodermal tissues in mouse embryos might express these proteins to provide robustness to loss of hace <dig> protein. most recently, it has been reported that knockdown of hace <dig> using a splice-blocking mo causes ros production in zebrafish  <cit> . although this report has not described the effects of the mo on zebrafish embryonic development, the gross morphology of embryos injected with the mo is apparently normal. whereas a splice-blocking morpholino inhibits only zygotic expression but not maternal expression, a translation blocking morpholino, which was used in our study, inhibits both maternal expression and zygotic expression. this might explain the difference between our results and those from the previous study in zebrafish.

hace <dig> depletion in xenopus laevis embryos led to diverse developmental defects, including a shortened body axis and the inhibition of eye and pigment formation. these defects were at least partly rescued by rac <dig> inhibition. in addition, we showed that overexpression of active rac <dig> in the presumptive neural plate led to a delay in neural tube closure and a number of subsequent developmental defects, which are similar to hace <dig> morphants. the migration of neural crest cells, which give rise to pigment cells, is disturbed by constitutively active or dominant negative forms of rac <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the inhibition of pigment formation may result from impaired neural crest migration. additionally, conditional knockout of rac <dig> in the surface ectoderm results in a failure of neural tube closure in mice  <cit> . thus, fine tuning of rac <dig> activity may be important for neural tube closure. however, the detailed molecular mechanism by which excessive active rac <dig> affects neural tube closure is unclear. rac <dig> regulates a variety of biological processes, including cytoskeleton remodeling and pcp signaling regulation  <cit> . pcp signaling plays an important role in neural tube closure  <cit> , and there may be crosstalk between rhoa and rac <dig> signaling in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . it would be interesting to investigate the presence of the crosstalk and, if it is present, to clarify the regulation mechanism of the pcp pathway through rhoa and rac <dig> signaling during neural tube closure.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study show that the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase hace <dig> plays an important role in early developmental processes in xenopus laevis. detailed analyses of downstream targets of hace <dig> should be performed in future studies.
