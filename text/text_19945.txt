BACKGROUND
retrotransposons are widely distributed among eukaryotic genomes and occupy a substantial fraction of genome. these repeats increase in number by retroposition, which involves transcription of their genomic copies followed by reverse transcription of an rna intermediate and results in cdnas reintegration into the genome host  <cit> . retrotransposons are divided into ltr elements, long interspersed nuclear elements , and short interspersed nuclear elements  <cit> .

both lines and sines become amplified in genomes during evolution, but while lines encode the enzymes required for their retrotransposition, sines presumably borrow these enzymes from other sources, most likely from lines  <cit> . researchers have observed that the sequences of many sine and line pairs isolated from many organisms are similar in their 3'end regions  <cit> . recently, we characterized a couple of sine and line, designated hamo sine and its partner line, in silver carp and bighead carp based on hybridization capture of repetitive elements from digested genomic dna in solution using a bead-probe  <cit> . we found that hamo sines was active and amplified recently in the genomes of these two young species utilizing the enzymatic machinery for retroposition of hamol <dig>  <cit> .

sines are short  repetitive elements that often are present at more than  <dig> copies per genome. many sines can be categorized into families based on sequence similarity and into subfamilies based on the presence of diagnostic nucleotides and/or deletions. an active member of a subfamily yields new copies through retroposition. after their dispersion within the genome, individual nonactive members of a subfamily accumulate mutations randomly. thus, the average sequence divergence of members of a subfamily can be used to roughly estimate the age of the subfamily  <cit> .

a typical sine is composed of three parts: the trna-related region, the trna-unrelated region and the line-derived region with a polya or short duplication tail. the existence of rna pol iii promoters in the trna-related region ensures the transcriptional activity of sines, whereas the line-derived region allows the sine to utilize the lines's enzymes for retrotransposition. the central region  between the trna- and line-derived regions is quite different and is not strongly conserved between different families, although two conserved central regions have been reported for two sine families   <cit> .

to reveal the species distribution and evolutionary history of sines and lines in more cyprinid genomes, we performed a multi-species search for hamo sine and its partner line in almost all subfamilies of cyprinidae, as well as in distantly related fishes  using the bead-probe capture and internal-sine-primer polymerase chain reaction  techniques. the detailed sequence alignment and nucleotide diversity estimation of hamo sine characterized to date enabled us to understand amplification and evolution of hamo sine in cyprinid fishes.

the rag <dig> sequences of the noted  three species was substituted by another species in the same genus, because of the absence of their rag <dig> sequence in ncbi. a: distoechodon tumirostris b: schizothorax meridionalis c: barbodes huangchuchieni

isolation of sine and line sequences using bead-probe capture and internal-primer-sine pcr techniques
a rapid bead-probe capture technique based on magnetic separation was used to isolate full-size of hamo sine copies from unknown genomes as described previously  <cit> . the clone hmo41_it was bound to beads to act as the probe for capturing hamo sine similar sequences from a haeiii-fragmented genomic dna pool . the beads were washed once with  <dig> μl hybridization buffer  for  <dig> min, then  <dig> μl of the denatured genomic pool were added to the resuspend the beads. hybridization at 55°c took place for  <dig> hours, then non-complementary sequences were removed by washing successively with  <dig> μl ten <dig>  three times for  <dig> min each; and  <dig> μl buffer  three times for  <dig> min;  <dig> μl ten <dig> for  <dig> min. finally, the captured fragments were amplified by pcr and cloned directly into t-vector for sequencing. additionally, many line sequences were isolated simultaneously during the above process because the probe contains the common tail shared by sine and line.

internal-primer-sine pcr was conducted to amplify the internal region corresponding to residues 18- <dig> of the whole hamo sine consensus sequences  using a pair of primers . the pcr was run in a total volume of  <dig> μl including  <dig> ng dna template with  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s, 62°c for  <dig> s, and 72°c for  <dig> s. the internal-primer-sine-pcr was conducted in the selected  <dig> species of cyprinidae to detect many individual sine copies. finally, about  <dig> clones were characterized and sequenced for each species.

naming of clones
many hamo sequences  were isolated and characterized from distinct cyprinids fishes. each locus was named after the number of the clone and the name of the species from which it was isolated. in the middle, f or i was used to represent the internal sine sequence or full-size sequence obtained from the bead-probe capture  or internal-primer-sine pcr , respectively. for example, ltu_i_ <dig> means that the number of the clone was  <dig> and it was isolated from leuciscus tumensis based on the internal-primer-sine pcr.

estimation of copy number using quantitative rt-pcr
plasmid hmo41_it and genomic dna were prepared as the standard and samples for real-time pcr, respectively . their concentrations then were measured using a spectrophotometer, and serial dilutions were prepared as templates to perform rt-pcr in a pcr machine  together. all real-time pcr was performed with  <dig> cycles at 95°c  <dig> s, 62°c  <dig> s, 72°c  <dig> s including primer itf and itr  and sybr green in a final volume of  <dig> ul. at last, a melting curve analysis was done after the amplification phase. the standard curve and data analysis were carried out in the software mj opticon monitor  <dig> .

construction of phylogenetic relationships of  <dig> fish species based on the rag <dig> gene
phylogenetic analysis was performed using bayesian inference within the program mrbayes  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the rag <dig> sequences used in this study were reported previously by our group  <cit> . for the bayesian analysis, two million generations were completed, with tree and parameter values recorded every  <dig> generations. four chains were run in each of the two independent analyses that mrbayes executed as a default. the chain heating temperature was set to  <dig> . at the end of the analysis the first 25% of stored trees were eliminated by setting sumtburnin to  <dig>  and the remaining trees were automatically compiled into a consensus tree by the program.

RESULTS
multi-species searching for hamo sine within the cyprinidae
internal-primer-sine pcr which amplified fragments corresponding to residues 18- <dig> of the hamo sine consensus sequence  were conducted. the result showed that hamo sine was present in all  <dig> representatives of the family cyprinidae tested in this study. to unambiguously confirm them and obtain enough hamo sine sequences to observe their diversities, we cloned the positive fragments and sequenced about  <dig> positive clones for each species. moreover,  <dig> internal sequences corresponding to different individual hamo-sine copies from the  <dig> cyprinid genomes were isolated and characterized.

four subfamilies and their different patterns of polya insertion and short tandem duplication in trna-unrelated region
sixty-seven full-size sequences and  <dig> internal-sine sequences   <cit>  from  <dig> species of the family cyprinidae were aligned. on the basis of the presence of the diagnostic nucleotides, four subfamilies  exist, each of which is supported by abundant sequences from many distantly related species. figure  <dig> shows the alignment of the consensus sequences of the four hamo sine subfamilies; the consistent nucleotide changes for each subfamily  were recognized at  <dig> positions. most of the diagnostic nucleotides  were distributed in the trna-unrelated region of hamo sine, and the diagnostic nucleotides were composed of different patterns of polya insertion, short tandem repeats, and deletion or mutation in the respective subfamilies.

the four subfamilies can be distinguished from each other mainly by their different trna-unrelated regions. the different patterns of insertion and duplication in different subfamilies constitute the most diagnostic nucleotides that lead to division of the family into different subfamilies. type i has a variable polya  insertions and a tataa repeat two to three times. type ii has two variable polya insertions whereas type iii has a taaatg sequence that repeats two times.

the common tail is conserved in primary and secondary structures between hamo sine and hamo line
many hamo line <dig> clones were obtained simultaneously when isolating hamo sines  because the probe contained a tail region shared by hamo sine and its partner line. a consensus sequence of the hamo line <dig> tail was constructed by aligning all  <dig> isolated hamo lines  plus  <dig> previously reported in silver carp and bighead carp. the consensus sequences of the four hamo sine subfamilies shared an almost identical 42-bp-long 3'tail to hamo line , suggesting that hamo sine may borrow the enzymatic machinery of hamo line to proliferate in the cyprinid genomes through the conserved 3' -tail.

estimation of copy number using quantitative rt-pcr
to estimate the number of copies of hamo sine in each species, the pair of primers used in internal-primer-sine-pcr was also used to amplify the hamo sine sequences in genomic dna  and in the plasmid hmo41_it  using rt-pcr. we used two diluted genomic dna as tested samples to perform pcr reaction. the final estimations of copy numbers using different concentrations of the genomic dna template were very close, suggesting that the results of the experiment were stable and efficient. table  <dig> summarizes the detailed results. the copy numbers of hamo elements in  <dig> cyprinid genomes were estimated to vary from  <dig> to  <dig>  in other words, hamo sine may constitute  <dig> -10% of cyprinid genomes . considering the possibility of mismatch between primers with more divergent hamo sine sequences, the results of quantitative rt-pcr were minimal estimates of hamo sine copy numbers in respective genomes.

hamo sine in zebrafish genome
danio rerio was a cyprinid fish belonging to danioninae, cyprinidae. in previous research, the trees resulting from cyprinid phylogenetic analyses of the rag <dig> gene place the danioninae as the basal-most group in the family and divide the remaining cyprinids into two divergent subfamilies cyprininae and leuciscinae  <cit> . in this paper,  <dig> cyprinid fish were selected for representing various taxa within cyprinidae, and their phylogeny based on rag <dig> gene  also revealed the pattern that within the cyprinidae, danio emerged at first and the remaining cyprinid species clustered into two major clades, cyprininae and leuciscinae. the basal relationship of the danioninae, relative to other cyprinidae, has also been confirmed in other recent molecular analyses  <cit> .

for investigating the hamo sine in zebrafish, the consensus sequences of four subfamilies  were used as queries to blastn danio rerio database in ncbi website. because the primer regions of these consensus sequences are identical and uninformative, we eliminated these regions from the whole consensus sequences, as shown in figure  <dig>  these consensus sequences were about 83- <dig> bp in length containing about 31- <dig> bp central region and partial trna-related region and line2-derived region. we set the parameter e =  <dig>  and count the number of similar sequences with query  in zebrafish genome.  <dig> sequences ,  <dig> sequences ,  <dig> sequences  were found to be similar with the consensus sequences of type i, ii and iii, respectively. because these similar sequences in zebrafish are too divergent with the corresponding type i, ii and iii consensus sequences, especially in the central region representing the most specific diagnostic nucleotide, we couldn't determine the presence of type i, ii and iii of hamo sine in zebrafish. as our described, type i mainly distributed in lineage leuciscinae and type ii were found only in some species. their restricted species distribution may lead to the absence of them in primitive cyprinid species danio rerio. in contrast, we found  <dig> sequences similar with consensus sequence of type iv with identity 72%-90% in zebrafish. majority of them can be identified and characterized to be members of type iv since type iv were the oldest subfamily and its members have more divergence between sequences and dispersed in the whole cyprinidae. the alignment of type iv sequences in zebrafish with the consensus sequence of type iv in this paper was provided as additional file  <dig> 

moreover, among our isolated hamo internal sequences in  <dig> cyprinid fishes, there are tens of hamo sequences that have more divergent central region with each other as well as with the type i, ii, iii and iv . we couldn't divide them into specific subfamilies now because of lacking enough supported sequences. when using them as queries to blastn danio rerio genome, tens or hundreds sequences similar with many queries have been found in zebrafish. in addition, we also obtained  <dig> hamo sine sequences by cloning the inter-primer sine pcr products in zebrafish, provided in additional file  <dig>  all these evidences manifest that numerous hamo sine copies presented in the primitive cyprinid fish danio rerio and dispersed in the whole cyprinidae.

discussion
multiple source genes are responsible for amplification of the hamo sine in cyprinid genomes
in this work, we isolated and characterized many hamo sines from  <dig> species of the cyprinidae family. the results show that the hamo sine is widespread in cyprinid genomes and that copy numbers are about 104- <dig> 

based on the rag <dig> gene, we constructed the phylogenetic relationships among the  <dig> species studied in order to map the information obtained from isolated clones in each species . the ratio of different subfamily clones found in each species could roughly reflect the lineage in which the subfamilies expanded preferentially, although potential statistical bias resulting from the small number of clones analyzed exists. the result of this analysis showed that type i preferentially expanded in the clade leuciscinae, especially in the tribe xenocyprinidini, which contained many young and closely related endemic taxa from east asia. in contrast, type ii distributed on some non- xenocyprinidini species, whereas type iii and iv seemed to be dispersed throughout the whole cyprinidae family. judging from the distribution of members of the same sequence subfamily of sines within different lineages and from the distribution of the different-sequence subfamilies within the same lineage, we concluded that multiple dispersed loci are responsible for the amplification of sines in cyprinid genomes. in other words, multiple rivalrous source genes  expanded in cyprinid genomes and showed different advantages of expansion in different lineages. the different advantage of expansion among subfamilies may results from the retropositional regulation to source genes in the process of transcription and selection at the rna level. many factors, such as the chromatin context near a newly transposed sine, methylation, cis-acfing promoter elements, and trans-acting factors involve in this process  <cit> . because the effects of these factors might differ among species, frequencies of retroposition might also differ among specific lineages  <cit> .

from the mapping results, type i seems to have expanded actively in the leuciscinae clade and to have undergone retroposition among populations of silver carp and bighead carp. however, type i seems not to have flourished in the cyprininae clade, as there are only two clones found in two species. thus, we deduced that the master  gene of type i was first generated in a common ancestor of the family cyprinidae, and then this gene was vertically inherited during evolution of the cyprinid lineage. a highly dominant source gene for the type i subfamily may have been newly created by retroposition and actively amplified in the leuciscinae clade. this scenario indicates that the actual sequence of this subfamily might not be the cause of the high retropositional efficiency of sines. a local environment such as the site of retroposition, rna secondary structure, and promoter activity might be crucial for the establishment of a highly dominant source gene during evolution  <cit> .

the above analysis indicates that multiple source genes  actively amplified within a certain lineage or within the whole family of cyprinidae. therefore, the changes  that occurred in the trna-unrelated region may not affect the efficiency of retroposition of different actively dominant source genes . the high efficiency and successful proliferation of hamo sines might have occurred for two reasons. first, hamo sines retain the overall secondary structure and conserved the a and b box in the trna-related region, which ensures the rna pol iii recognition and transcriptional activity of sines. second, the 3' tail of hamo sines and hamo line <dig> is almost identical in primary sequence and secondary structures, which allows the former to utilize the line <dig> enzymatic machinery.

the species distribution of hamo sine
to determine the species distribution of hamo sine, inter-primer sine pcr was also conducted in non-cyprinid fishes. four different ten-fold dna dosage:  <dig>  ng,  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng were used for each species. firstly, for  <dig> cyprinid fishes, visible pcr band could be observed when  <dig>  ng dna was used as template in pcr . secondly, in the case of dna of non-cyprinid fishes in cypriniform, pcr products were observed when  <dig> ng dna of myxocyprinus asiaticus , hemimyzon abbreviata , gyrinocheilus aymonieri  and  <dig> ng dna of misgurnus anguillicaudatus  were used, as shown in figure 7b. we cloned and sequenced these pcr products from these species. 3- <dig> hamo sine related sequences with average identity about 70% were obtained in each species, see additional file  <dig>  all these sequences and the gel electrophoresis show that hamo sine-related sequences may presented in the other families of order cypriniform. we deduced that the more dna  must be used in pcr for detection of hamo sine may result from the mutation in primer-matched regions of hamo sequences in the investigated species since the investigated species diverged more with cyprinids. more evidence and sequences need to be obtained to determine the sine family in other families of order cypriniform.

in siluriformes, two species were used: gagata dolichonema , pseudobagrus truncatus . some pcr products were generated only when  <dig> ng dna template were used . we sequenced the pcr products and found that they belong to the non-specific amplified products. in the case of other order of bony fishes, the pcr product corresponding to the hamo sine elements was not detected when  <dig> ng dna was used for each sample of the order polypteriformes, lepidosteiformes, acipenseriformes, osteoglossiforms.

thus, the pcr analysis has demonstrated that the genomes of representatives of families catostomidae, cobitidae, gyrinocheilidae and homalopteridae may contain hamo related sine elements whereas the genomes of other order siluriformes, polypteriformes, lepidosteiformes, acipenseriformes, osteoglossiforms may do not carry this retroposon.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, by searching for hamo sines from different taxa within the cyprinidae, we found that hamo sines were widespread in cyprinid genomes. the hundreds of sine sequences found in our study revealed that multiple source subfamilies actively expanded and underwent retroposition within a certain lineage or within the whole family of cyprinidae. thus, hamo sine should be a useful phylogenetic marker for future analyses of the evolutionary relationships among species in the cyprinidae family.
