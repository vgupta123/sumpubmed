BACKGROUND
importance of ca2+ and ca2+ regulators
ca2+ is involved in cellular excitation and is an important second messenger. in a resting cell, typical intracellular ca2+ concentrations are between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, while extracellular levels are much higher . consequently, maintaining this large electrochemical gradient is critical for normal cell physiology and necessitates an energy dependent mechanism of ca2+ expulsion  <cit> . plasma membrane ca2+ atpases are ubiquitously expressed in the plasma membrane and use atp to pump ca2+ out of the cell. four paralogs are found in mammalian cells: atp2b <dig>  atp2b <dig>  atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig>  these proteins are highly similar but differ in tissue expression and speed of activation.

animal and disease models associated with atp2bs
the importance of atp2bs for normal cellular function is demonstrated by widespread tissue expression, a pivotal role in disease, and the lethality of atp2b null mice  <cit> . in mammals, atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig> are the housekeeping ca2+ regulators expressed throughout all tissues  <cit> . null mutations of atp2b <dig> are embryonic lethal and null mutations of atp2b <dig> cause problems with sperm motility  <cit> . genome wide association studies in humans have linked snps in atp2b <dig> to increased cardiovascular risk  <cit>  and a mutation in atp2b <dig> was associated with spastic paraplegia  <cit> . atp2b <dig> is expressed predominately in the brain and mammary glands. in mice, atp2b <dig> null mutations cause profound deafness and ataxia  <cit> . similarly, mutations in human atp2b <dig> are associated with hearing loss  <cit> . atp2b <dig> is also an emerging player in autism and breast cancer  <cit> .

atp2b <dig> haploinsufficiency
atp2b <dig> is highly expressed in the auditory system which is extremely sensitive to small physiological changes. this makes it an ideal model for studying fine tuning of ca2+ regulation. the deafwaddler  mutant mice, dfw
2j and dfw
i <dig>  have null mutations in atp2b <dig> resulting in negligible expression of atp2b <dig> transcript and protein  <cit> . heterozygous mutants express about 50% normal protein levels and have significantly impaired hearing sensitivity compared to wild-type animals  <cit> . this finding suggests that one normal copy of atp2b <dig> is insufficient to produce a normal hearing phenotype and defines atp2b <dig> as haploinsufficient.

the original dfw mutation is a hypomorph that decreases, but does not completely abolish atp2b <dig> activity. studies of pump kinetics estimate that total function of atp2b <dig> in homozygous dfw mutants is ~30% of normal animals  <cit> . although homozygous mutants are profoundly deaf, heterozygous dfw mice do not have any significant hearing loss  <cit> . this is surprising considering the predicted increase in total pump function for dfw heterozygotes over the dfw
2j and dfw
i <dig> heterozygotes is quite small. thus, the threshold for atp2b <dig> pump dysfunction in the auditory system is narrow and exhibits the necessity for tight regulation of this gene and protein.

the importance of studying endogenous regulation of atp2bs
although a wealth of information exists for post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating atp2bs, there is very little knowledge of transcriptional initiation of these genes. the only atp2b promoter studied to date was reported in a brief publication outlining the promoter elements of atp2b <dig>  <cit> . there have been no studies looking at the promoter of the atp2b <dig> gene. it is clear that understanding the intricacies of atp2b gene transcription will be important for combating the pathophysiology of diseases associated with this family of ca2+ regulators. with over  <dig> different splice variants and four different genes, the atp2b family is vast. the current study aims to characterize the promoter elements of the neuronal and hair cell-specific α transcript of atp2b <dig>  and identify important transcription factors that bind to and modulate expression of this gene.

RESULTS
genomic modifications at atp2b <dig> indicate transcriptional hot-spots in mouse cerebellum
the genomic region surrounding atp2b <dig> is vast and complex. with  <dig> exons and four different transcriptional start site  variants, there are many opportunities for gene regulation. of the four distinct atp2b <dig> tss variants, α and β are the variants expressed in neurons. αatp2b <dig> is the primary transcript in the hair cells of young mice   <cit> . the α and β transcripts share the same coding exons but differ in the sequence of their 5′ untranslated regions. utilizing the ucsc genome browser, we compared the genomic regions of α and β atp2b <dig> in two distinct tissues to identify transcriptionally active domains. chromatin features of interest included dnase i hypersensitivity , an indication of uncoiled, accessible dna; rna polymerase ii  occupancy, the enzyme that transcribes dna into rna; and trimethylation of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig> , a hallmark of transcriptionally active promoters. the heat maps for these marks in the region surrounding the 5′ end of atp2b <dig> reveal several distinct signals in 8 week mouse cerebellum  not detected in 8 week old heart  <cit>  . in particular, the regions directly surrounding the noncoding iα and iβ exons contain significant levels of h3k4me <dig> and rna pol ii occupancy and coincide with predicted cpg islands, known initiation sites for ubiquitously expressed genes  <cit> . together, these data suggest that αatp2b <dig> and βatp2b <dig> transcripts are both transcribed in the cerebellum and have unique start sites. this allows for differential regulation and tissue specific expression. we have elected to focus on the αatp2b <dig> transcript because of its unique expression profile in the brain and sensory epithelium.fig.  <dig> 
atp2b <dig> genomic region adapted from the ucsc genome browser. image exported from ucsc genome browser , data is from the encyclopedia of dna elements  consortium  <cit> . atp2b <dig> transcripts are shown in blue. a the whole genomic region surrounding atp2b <dig> is shown. marks for transcriptional modulation are shown in 8 week mouse cerebellum vs 8 week mouse heart tissue. the rna-sequencing  data suggests that both the α and β transcripts of atp2b <dig> are expressed in the cerebellum. neither transcript appears to be expressed in the heart. both the α and β transcripts of atp2b <dig> have a cpg island at their tsss. markers of active transcription  are present in the cerebellum  but are not present in the heart. b the region surrounding the αatp2b <dig> tss is enlarged to show detail  <cit> 




identifying the promoter of the αatp2b <dig> transcript
the location of the cpg island and pattern of histone methylation in the cerebellum suggest that promoter elements are likely located directly upstream of the αatp2b <dig> tss. to test this empirically, the 5′ utr and 5 kbp region containing the cpg island were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector . all constructs are numbered relative to the tss, which maps to the negative strand of chromosome  <dig> at base  <dig> , <dig> . the “full-length” αatp2b <dig> promoter construct contains  <dig> bases located directly upstream of the tss from  <dig> , <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig> . note that only the exons of the 5′ utr were included in the construct, the 5′ utr spans approximately 200 kbp of the genome .fig.  <dig> promoter construct cartoon and luciferase assay. a
αatp2b <dig> promoter elements and restriction sites. the gene for atp2b <dig> is located on the reverse strand oriented from right to left. this schematic represents the full promoter construct cloned into the luciferase vector. the full proximal promoter construct contains the three exons of the 5′ utr  and the 1st translated exon  up to the tss . together these exons account for about  <dig> bases in the total construct. the rest of the  <dig>  kbp construct contains the dna directly upstream of the iα exon . the cpg island is contained between + <dig> and − <dig> bases around the tss . the restriction sites used to create promoter construct truncations are indicated by roman numerals on the cartoon, their exact locations can be found in table  <dig>  b the luciferase assay indicates that the minimal promoter elements are contained in the 5′ utr and cpg island. the promoter is directional. transcription is not initiated without the cpg island and the 5′ utr. activator elements are contained within the first  <dig> – <dig>  kbp of the promoter. based on evidence from this figure elements upstream of  <dig>  kbp seem to be inhibitory. comparisons to the pgl <dig> empty luciferase vector were done using a student’s t test. data shown is the average of three biological replicates for at least three experiments, variation is shown as standard error of the mean

ten predominately neuronal or sensory-epithelium derived cell lines were screened for expression of atp2b <dig> transcripts . atp2b <dig> gene expression was measured via quantitative pcr  with a cutoff at  <dig> cycles. under these conditions only two cell lines expressed detectable levels of atp2b <dig>  oc- <dig> cells from the immortomouse organ of corti and the n2a neuroblastoma cell line. given the origins of the other cell lines it is surprising that atp2b <dig> is not expressed; we speculate that this is an artifact of immortalization.

for the luciferase assay, we chose to use oc- <dig> cells and related oc- <dig> cells. these cell lines were immortalized during hair cell differentiation and, although oc- <dig> cells do not consistently express atp2b <dig>  oc- <dig> cells express hair cell markers that oc- <dig> lacks  <cit> . for this reason it was included in our luciferase assays. a series of αatp2b <dig> promoter luciferase constructs were transiently transfected into oc- <dig> and oc- <dig> cells and the fold change in promoter activity over empty pgl <dig> vector was determined . the greatest amount of luciferase activity above background was observed with the shortest promoter construct . the inclusion of an additional 500 bp of 5′ sequence  had no detectable effect on promoter activity. when the length of the promoter fragment was extended further in the 5′ direction, the amount of luciferase activity began to decrease until it reached baseline levels. reversing the orientation of the promoter or removal of the 5′ utr and cpg islands completely abolished any detectable activity. these data demonstrate that the 5′ utr and cpg islands are necessary and sufficient for promoter activity, and maps the minimal promoter between bases + <dig> and − <dig>  the remaining proximal promoter region most likely contains important tissue specific enhancer and repressor elements.

atoh <dig>  egr <dig>  gata <dig>  pou4f <dig>  and usf <dig> are potential transcriptional modulators of αatp2b2
binding prediction software, matinspector and tfbind  <cit>  were used to identify potential transcription factor binding sites in the proximal promoter of the αatp2b <dig> transcript. the entire region  was analyzed and contained putative sites for thousands of transcription factors. to narrow down likely candidates we compared factors from the αatp2b <dig> promoter to the βatp2b <dig> proximal promoter and identified factors that were enriched in or unique to the αatp2b <dig> promoter. using the shared harvard inner ear laboratory database  we determined expression of candidate genes in auditory hair cells  <cit>  . we cross referenced these lists with transcription factor expression data for the oc- <dig> and oc- <dig> cells used in the luciferase assays. published data for transcript expression in oc- <dig> cells was verified for select genes via qpcr . two important hair cell factors, atoh <dig> and pou4f <dig>  were included based on manually identified binding sites in the proximal promoter . candidates were narrowed down to the following transcription factors: atoh <dig>  egr <dig>  gata <dig>  pou4f <dig>  and usf <dig>  together these transcription factors are involved in hair cell development and maintenance, synaptic plasticity, regeneration and tissue repair . the predicted binding sites for these genes can be found in fig. 3c.fig.  <dig> transcription factors of interest and their binding sites in the αatp2b <dig>  promoter. transcription factors were selected based on a multi-faceted in silico search. a predicted transcription factor binding sites were found using software  or manually identified using published consensus sequences  <cit> . hair cell expression was determined utilizing shield data  <cit> . shield rna-seq data was collected from facs sorted gfp expressing hair cells, transcripts with reads above zero were considered expressed and denoted in the table with a . b transcription factor expression in oc- <dig> cells was determined utilizing qpcr and cross-referenced with published microarray data. egr <dig>  gata <dig> and usf <dig> are expressed . data is the average of three technical replicates for three biological replicates, variation is shown as standard error of the mean. c predicted binding sites for atoh <dig>  egr <dig>  gata <dig>  pou4f <dig> and usf <dig> are shown. note the clustering of predicted binding sites for transcription factors in the cpg island




egr <dig> and atoh <dig> modulate the isolated αatp2b <dig> promoter in oc- <dig> cells
to determine which of these transcription factors modulates the αatp2b <dig> transcript promoter, cdna of the candidate transcription factors was cloned into a pcdna vector upstream of ires + egfp. these vectors were co-transfected into oc- <dig> cells along with the  αatp2b <dig> luciferase construct. gene expression levels were similar for all of the transcription factors post-transfection . the  construct was used because it is the longest promoter construct that has activity over baseline in the oc- <dig> cell line . figure 3c shows a cartoon of the sequence from base + <dig> to base − <dig> in detail with the location of transcription factor binding sites and the cpg island. this experiment reveals that atoh <dig> decreases αatp2b <dig> promoter activity by 30% while egr <dig> produces a significant twofold increase . overexpression of gata <dig>  pou4f <dig> or usf <dig> had no significant effect on αatp2b <dig> promoter activity .fig.  <dig> co-expression of transcription factors with promoter constructs. a luciferase activity of the αatp2b <dig> promoter construct  when co-expressed with transcription factor constructs or empty vector. luciferase activity of the  αatp2b <dig> promoter construct co-expressed with transcription factor constructs was normalized to the luciferase activity of the  promoter co-transfected with empty vector. values were compared to a theoretical value of  <dig> utilizing a one-sample t test . b to narrow down the site of egr <dig> activation in the αatp2b <dig> promoter, three promoter truncations were assayed. the promoter truncation constructs were co-transfected with egr <dig> or empty vector. luciferase activity of promoter constructs co-transfected with egr <dig> were normalized to luciferase activity of the promoter construct co-expressed with empty vector. normalized values were compared to a theoretical value of  <dig> using a one sample t test . activation occurs over baseline promoter activity in all three constructs suggesting that the egr <dig> binding site is contained in the region of the cpg island. data for the αatp2b <dig> promoter luciferase construct  is the same in both a and b. data shown is the average of three biological replicates for at least three experiments, variation is shown as standard error of the mean, dashed line represents the theoretical value of 1




identifying the region of egr <dig> activity in the αatp2b <dig> promoter
atoh <dig> and egr <dig> are capable of modulating the  αatp2b <dig> luciferase construct in the oc- <dig> cell line, indicating functional significance in a mammalian cell model. the potential binding site of atoh <dig> can be narrowed to a single site in the cpg island of the αatp2b <dig> promoter . conversely, egr <dig> has numerous predicted binding sites throughout the αatp2b <dig> promoter region. to map the location of functional egr <dig> binding sites within the promoter, three different luciferase reporter constructs: , , and  were co-transfected with egr <dig> or empty vector into oc- <dig> cells. all three constructs showed a significant increase in luciferase activity with co-expression of egr <dig> . this data suggests that egr <dig> binds the αatp2b <dig> promoter between bases + <dig> and − <dig>  due to limitations of restriction sites in this region, putative binding sites for egr <dig> were not narrowed further. the putative binding sites for egr <dig> are contained in the cpg island which is 80% gc. due to limitations of pcr and sequencing under these conditions, mutagenesis was not performed  <cit> .

the effect of transcription factor overexpression on endogenous atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig> transcript levels
the luciferase assay results indicate that egr <dig> and atoh <dig> have a functional effect on the isolated αatp2b <dig> transcript promoter. however, this observation does not indicate that atoh <dig> and egr <dig> effect endogenous levels of atp2b <dig> transcript expression. to test this, egr <dig> and atoh <dig> were overexpressed in n2a and oc- <dig> cells that transcribe atp2b <dig> endogenously. gene expression levels were similar for all of the transcription factors after transfection . due to the low basal levels of atp2b <dig> expression, taqman assays with high target specificity and accuracy were utilized for this experiment. the taqman probes do not discriminate between the different alternate start site variants of atp2b <dig> so total atp2b <dig> transcript levels were quantified. atp2b <dig> transcript expression was also measured because there is evidence that atp2b <dig> compensates for decreased expression of atp2b <dig> in the stereocilia of atp2b <dig> mutant mice  <cit> .

in oc- <dig> and n2a cells, egr <dig> overexpression increases transcript levels of atp2b <dig> recapitulating our luciferase results . when atoh <dig> is overexpressed in oc- <dig> and n2a cells, atp2b <dig> transcript levels are unaffected . although atoh <dig> overexpression did not significantly inhibit atp2b <dig> transcript, atp2b <dig> levels were found to increase  <dig>  fold over baseline in oc- <dig> cells . an atoh <dig> driven increase in atp2b <dig> transcript was not observed in n2a cells . given that atoh <dig> is specific to developing hair cells it is unsurprising that there is a cell-type specific effect. egr <dig> overexpression has no significant effects on atp2b <dig> expression in oc- <dig> or n2a cells . the luciferase data taken together with atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig> expression data suggest interplay between egr <dig> and atoh <dig> in oc- <dig> cells. egr <dig> increases atp2b <dig> expression while atoh <dig> inhibits the αatp2b <dig> promoter and increases atp2b <dig> expression .fig.  <dig> effect of overexpression of atoh <dig> and egr <dig> on endogenous levels of atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig>  a, b egr <dig> increases expression of atp2b <dig> in both oc- <dig> and n2a cell lines. atoh <dig> moderately inhibits expression of atp2b <dig> in oc- <dig>  and has no effect in n2a cells. c, d
atp2b <dig> transcript expression is unaffected by overexpression of egr <dig> in both oc- <dig> and n2a cells. atoh <dig> increases expression of atp2b <dig> transcript in oc- <dig> cells but not in n2a cells. comparisons to empty vector  were made using a student’s t test . data shown is the average of three technical replicates for three biological replicates in each cell line, variation is shown as standard error of the mean




shift and supershift assays indicate that egr <dig> binds to the αatp2b <dig> promoter
it is likely that both egr <dig> and atoh <dig> play a role in modulation of atp2bs. however, atoh <dig> did not significantly affect endogenous levels atp2b <dig> in oc- <dig> and n2a cells. given this negative data, only egr <dig> was included in the binding assays. to identify potential egr <dig> binding sites, data from matinspector was cross-referenced with tfbind software predictions. sites with matrix similarity of  <dig>  or higher  were included. this identified  <dig> overlapping binding sites that could be divided into seven different regions of the promoter . of particular interest are three sites in the cpg island near the tss between base − <dig> and base − <dig> . a probe targeting this region was designed to experimentally test the protein binding potential of this region. two positive control probes were used to verify the shift assay, one derived from the egr <dig> consensus sequence   <cit>  and a gel shift probe commercially available from santa cruz biotechnology . egr <dig> protein levels were measured in oc- <dig>  hela and nih/3t <dig> cells by immunoblotting. protein expression of egr <dig> was not detectable in oc- <dig> cells  or in nih/3t <dig> cells . egr <dig> was found in the nucleus and cytoplasm of hela cells .fig.  <dig> shift assays of egr <dig> binding to probe  derived from the αatp2b <dig> transcript promoter. all blots shown are 10 min exposures. a western blot of egr <dig> protein expression in nih/3t <dig> or hela cells. nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were compared. hela nuclear extract was used for shift assays due to its detectable expression of egr <dig>  b the  probe was used in this assay labeled with biotin  or unlabeled as self-competition  lane 1—free unbound biotin labeled probe is shown and is indicated by an open arrow head. lane 2—contains hela nuclear lysate, a shift is indicated by closed arrowhead. lanes 3–5—self-competition with unlabeled probe at increasing concentrations. c the  probe , two control probes  and the modified   probes were used in this assay. lanes 1– <dig> positive shifts for the  probe as well as two positive control probes designed to bind egr <dig> . lane 4— modified probe, four nucleotides in the egr <dig> cluster region were modified and the shift is abolished. d the  probe was used in this assay . lane 1—shows free unbound biotin labeled probe which is indicated by the open arrow head. lane 2—contains hela nuclear lysate and recapitulates the shift from 6b/c. there are three binding populations in the shift indicated by closed arrow heads . lane 3—reaction contains polyclonal igg antibody targeting egr <dig> along with hela nuclear lysate. addition of the anti-egr <dig> abolishes the binding of the second population to the probe . lane 4—reaction contains hela nuclear lysate and polyclonal igg antibody targeting atp2b <dig>  this antibody does not abolish the ii shift and acts as a negative control for the supershift observed in lane  <dig>  e average pixel density of the standard shift was normalized to the average pixel density of the test shift for each experiment . white boxes indicate the shifts being compared in each experiment. normalized values were compared to a theoretical value of  <dig> using a one sample t test . all results are significant




all emsas were performed using hela cell nuclear extracts . no protein binding activity was detected with two test probes for sequences either downstream or at the tss . a mobility shift is only observed with the dna probe derived from the site upstream of the tss  . formation of this shifted dna–protein complex is inhibited when increasing concentrations of unlabeled  dna probe are added as competitor. four nucleotides in egr <dig> binding cluster of the  dna probe were modified to investigate sequence specificity of binding . this modified probe  is unable to produce a shift when compared to the  probe  derived from the αatp2b <dig> promoter and two positive control probes  . these experiments indicate that the shift is sequence specific but does not indicate which protein is binding to the probe.

to determine if egr <dig> is the protein responsible for the mobility shift in fig. 6a and b, antibody to egr <dig> was added to the binding reactions. for these assays, the shifted complexes resolved into three distinct populations . the formation of complex ii was dramatically inhibited upon addition of the egr <dig> specific antibody but not the negative control antibody targeting atp2b <dig> . these results suggest that egr <dig> is binding to the  probe in a sequence specific manner to stimulate αatp2b <dig> promoter activity. although there are different populations  that remain bound to the probe in the presence of egr <dig> antibody it is likely that this is non-specific binding or it is binding of the probe to a protein besides egr <dig>  there are a number of predicted sp <dig> binding sites in the cpg island. previously published experiments have exhibited the similarities between binding sites for sp <dig> and egr <dig>  <cit> . it is plausible that this is the identity of the protein that remains bound to the probe in the supershift assay .

densitometry was employed to compare the standard shift assay against the test shift assay for each of the above experiments: self-competition, modified egr <dig> probe and supershift. the average pixel density of the standard shift was significantly darker than the test shift in all three experiments . this quantification supports the conclusion that egr <dig> binds to the  probe in a sequence specific manner.

the ca2+ atpases play an important role in maintaining cell homeostasis but little is known about initiation of transcription of these genes. atp2b <dig> has the fastest activation and is one of the primary atp pumps found in the brain and sensory epithelium. investigations of this gene have highlighted its pivotal role in normal function of the auditory system as well as the vestibular system  <cit> . of the two transcripts found in the brain  only the α transcript is found in the auditory hair cells of young mice . this study focuses on the α transcript because of its pivotal role in the normal function of the auditory system.

identification of the αatp2b <dig> minimal promoter and repressor elements
studies of the genomic region surrounding the atp2b <dig> gene indicate that the minimal promoter of the α transcript is likely located directly adjacent to the tss. our luciferase assay data narrows this to the region 2133 bp upstream of the tss. the abolishment of promoter activity upon removal of the cpg island and the 5′ utr narrows the minimal promoter to the  <dig> bps upstream of the αatp2b <dig> tss. in both oc- <dig> and oc- <dig> cell lines, activity decreases as the promoter is extended in the 5′ direction. this is likely due to repressor elements upstream of the minimal promoter. interestingly, the activity of the promoter falls off faster in oc- <dig> cells suggesting cell type specific repression and modulation of the promoter.

the effect of atoh <dig> and egr <dig> on atp2b2
in oc- <dig> cells, we find that atoh <dig> decreases αatp2b <dig> proximal promoter activity by ~30%. however, we did not detect a significant effect of atoh <dig> on endogenous levels of atp2b <dig> in n2a or oc- <dig> cells. this contradicts the luciferase assay which predicts that atoh <dig> would inhibit endogenous levels of atp2b <dig> in oc- <dig> cells. a caveat of this result is that atp2b <dig> is very close to the limit of detection in oc- <dig> cells making any decrease in expression challenging to measure. it is therefore possible that atoh <dig> does inhibit endogenous levels of atp2b <dig> in oc- <dig> cells but we were unable to detect it. this caveat does not apply to the egr <dig> overexpression assay because egr <dig> increases expression of atp2b <dig> in oc- <dig> cells . any increase in atp2b <dig> expression is in the detectable range of the assay. in addition to increasing endogenous levels of atp2b <dig> in oc- <dig> and n2a, egr <dig> also increases the activity of the αatp2b <dig> promoter twofold over empty vector. we conclude that egr <dig> increases promoter activity of αatp2b <dig> and expression of atp2b <dig> transcript in oc- <dig> and n2a cells while atoh <dig> represses promoter activity of αatp2b <dig> in oc- <dig> cells.

the interplay of egr <dig>  atoh <dig>  atp2b <dig> and atp2b4
in oc- <dig> cells, overexpression of atoh <dig> increased atp2b <dig> transcript  <dig>  times over baseline. however, the effect was not recapitulated in n2a cells. our data suggests that in organ of corti derived cells atoh <dig> causes increased expression of atp2b <dig>  shield data indicates that atoh <dig> is expressed throughout development in hair cells with a peak around postnatal day  <dig>  <cit>  . although shield data shows only low atp2b <dig> expression, other studies have exhibited expression of atp2b <dig> in the hair cells at postnatal day  <dig>  <cit> . this expression may be driven by atoh <dig> table  <dig> developmental rna-seq data from the shield database is shown

normalized transcript reads are from facs sorted mouse hair cells expressing gfp https://shield.hms.harvard.edu/datasets.html  <cit> . although atp2b <dig> expression is low, it is highest when atoh <dig> peaks at p <dig>  atp2b <dig> expression starts to ramp up as egr <dig> peaks and after atoh <dig> goes down




our data shows that egr <dig> increases expression of atp2b <dig> while atoh <dig> represses the αatp2b <dig> promoter. shield data indicates that egr <dig> levels are high in the hair cells of mice at embryonic day  <dig> and remain high with a peak at postnatal day  <dig>  atp2b <dig> expression steadily rises through all of the ages assayed and it is possible that atp2b <dig> levels are inhibited in early development by atoh <dig> and rises as atoh <dig> turns off .

this exhibits an interesting interplay between atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig>  it is known that atpases compensate for each other in knockout animals  <cit> . notably, in atp2b <dig> null mice, atp2b <dig> is expressed abnormally in stereocilia into adulthood  <cit> . in oc- <dig> cells, atoh <dig> increases expression of atp2b <dig> and represses the promoter of atp2b <dig>  this suggests that atoh <dig> may be a developmental switch for atp2bs in hair cells. for example, as atoh <dig> turns off it may allow for atp2b <dig> to be turned on.

the significance of egr <dig> and atp2b2
although egr <dig> increases expression of atp2b <dig> in both oc- <dig> and n2a cells, the low level of atp2b <dig> expression in both cell lines suggests there are other factors involved in transcriptional activation of this gene. this is unsurprising given the complexity of this gene and the necessity for tight control of atp2b <dig> for normal physiology. the effect of egr <dig> seems specific to atp2b <dig> as overexpression did not increase expression of the closely related atp2b <dig> gene in either oc- <dig> or n2a cells. investigation of the proximal promoter of atp2b <dig> on the ucsc genome browser suggests this is due to the lack of a cpg island. egr <dig> is important for neuronal and sensory systems through involvement in synaptic plasticity, retinal formation and acoustic trauma. additionally, it is implicated in auditory hair cell regeneration pathways .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first investigation of the atp2b <dig> promoter and is the second investigation of a promoter in the vast atp2b family. this study identified the minimal promoter elements of αatp2b <dig> including a cpg island. additionally, our investigations indicate that atoh <dig> and egr <dig> modulate αatp2b <dig> promoter activity. there appears to be interplay between egr <dig>  atoh <dig>  atp2b <dig> and atp2b <dig> in oc- <dig> cells; further studies are necessary to confirm these interactions and determine their physiological relevance in vivo. egr <dig> was also found to bind to a specific sequence  <dig> bases upstream of the tss in the cpg island of the αatp2b <dig> promoter. in conclusion, we have elucidated transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for atp2b <dig>  identified transcription factors that modulate expression of atp2b <dig> in the brain and peripheral auditory system, and established a foundation for future studies investigating expression of αatp2b <dig>
