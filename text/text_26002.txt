BACKGROUND
bacterial infections remain one of the major challenges to human societies around the world. in particular, the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria, which are difficult to treat and which can spread locally and systemically in different organs within the infected host, requires novel approaches for rapid diagnosis and efficient treatment  <cit> . also, a deeper understanding of pathogen biology as well as of the complex host-pathogen interactions between bacteria and host tissues are urgently required to improve antimicrobial strategies. staphylococcus aureus is a clinically highly relevant human pathogen, which has the potential to infect almost every organ leading to a number of diverse infections  <cit> , such as skin and wound infections, pneumonia, endocarditis and osteomyelitis  <cit> . s. aureus induces a strong immune response either via a plethora of toxins and superantigens  <cit> , complement activation, or by activation of the inflammasome and the related sterile injury danger signal pathways. yet, the dynamics of dissemination and the exact bacterial strategies to establish metastasizing infections in different organs are largely unknown.

for research on dissemination dynamics in the entire host organism, murine models of bacterial infections are pivotal. non-invasive in vivo imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography , fluorescence/bioluminescence imaging  or positron emission tomography , have been employed to visualize infections over the time course  <cit> . although different strategies for specific detection of bacteria have been developed  <cit> , most imaging studies target host factors  <cit>  or detect immune cells  <cit> . due to its high spatial resolution and excellent soft tissue contrast, especially mri is a versatile method to image inflammatory processes upon bacterial infections non-invasively. while native mri provides diagnostic information on tissue structures and the inflammatory status  <cit> , detection of distinct cellular populations requires labeling with a suitable contrast agent, such as iron oxide particles  <cit> . cell labeling and tracking experiments are commonly performed either by labeling immune cells in vitro and regrafting them or by systemic application of iron oxide particles which are then phagocytosed by macrophages  <cit> . by using negative iron contrast immunological reactions and bacteria-induced inflammatory dissemination have already been investigated in animal models of staphylococcus aureus <cit> , toxoplasma gondii <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit>  or lps-induced sepsis conditions  <cit> . however, only bli so far was capable of visualizing bacteria directly. this technique exploits detection of light emitted from luminescent proteins in transgenic and metabolically active bacteria. owing to this unique property, bli has become the most important and wide spread modality of detecting bacteria in vivo <cit> . here, we propose a complementary imaging modality based on mri that requires the application of pre-treated bacteria, but which is also suitable for metabolically inactive or anaerobic pathogens and which provides detailed information about the bacterial localization in tissue. while native mri provides diagnostic information on tissue structures and the inflammatory status, detection of distinct cellular populations requires labeling with a suitable contrast agent. we have used bimodal iron oxide nano particles  to detect bacteria and have monitored dissemination in mouse models of local and systemic s. aureus infection. while for eukaryotic cells a variety of labeling protocols for cell imaging have been established, bacteria require specific labeling procedures that account for the presence of the bacterial cell wall. we have implemented a protocol that affords stable labeling of s. aureus cells with rhodamine-labeled 5-nm citrate-coated ionps.

RESULTS
labeling strategy
depending on the phagocytotic cell characteristics, eukaryotic cells are commonly labeled either by incubation, transfection or electroporation  <cit> . to establish a labeling protocol for bacteria with mri-sensitive contrast agents, we applied different labeling strategies and  electroporated electro-competent bacterial cells,  incubated electro-competent bacterial cells or  incubated unmodified bacterial cells with iron oxide particles of different size and coating. labeling efficiency was assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using rhodamine-labeled particles and syto  <dig> for co-registration . syto  <dig> is a dna marker and generally labels all bacteria in a population with a green fluorescence  <cit> . our results showed that the pivotal step was to manipulate the structure of the cell wall by preparing electro-competent cells . electroporation of electro-competent s. aureus bacteria in the presence of 5-nm citrate-coated ionps, according to bio-rad standard protocols  <cit> , produced iron-labeled bacteria . however, the procedure resulted in  <dig> ± 22% cell death, visible as iron-labeled cell debris by electron microscopy  and precluded the method as labeling strategy for imaging experiments. on the other hand, when unmodified cells were simply incubated with ionps, no fluorescence signal was detectable . in contrast, after simple incubation of competent s. aureus bacteria with iron particles the rhodamine fluorescence signal was observable at the cell surface . compared to untreated cells the iron-labeled cell population showed the same natural cell death. electron microscopy confirmed that clusters of ionps were bound to the proteoglycane matrix that surrounds the cell . an iron concentration of  <dig> μmol fe per ml and  <dig> bacteria was required to achieve sound labeling. by atomic spectrometry the iron load per cell was determined as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg fe.

larger particles or particles with other surface properties did not result in a homogeneous labeling of the cells, as shown by fluorescence microscopy . all studied 100-nm ionps, independent from coating and surface charge, formed large particle aggregates which were attached to sporadic cells . when electro-competent s. aureus bacteria were incubated with 5-nm particles, only particles with citrate-coating led to a uniform iron labeling, while amine-coated particles labeled the cell suspension very inhomogeneously and resulted in scattered red fluorescent bacteria . in contrast, for gram-negative e. coli bacteria good labeling results were achieved both for citrate- and amine-coated ionps leading to a labeling efficiency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/cell and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/cell respectively .

it is known that electro-competent cells have a weakened cell wall with pores in the structure  <cit>  and a much more homogeneous distribution of positively and negatively charged ions on the peptidoglycan matrix, providing an enlarged surface for interactions between charged iron particles and the cell wall. in gram-positive s. aureus bacteria the cell wall mainly consists of a thick peptidoglycan layer giving rise to a positive net charge which may explain the high labeling efficiency when citrate-coated iron particles were used. in contrast, in gram-negative e. coli bacteria the negatively charged lipopolysaccharide outer membrane leaf  <cit> , which envelopes the cell, may explain the good labeling results for amine-coated ionps.

in vitro assays
to exclude a possible influence of the labeling procedure on bacterial cell characteristics we investigated growth behavior as well as cytotoxicity and invasion of iron-labeled bacteria. growth curves did not differ significantly between untreated cells, and competent cells either with or without iron incubation . furthermore, infection models in huvecs did not reveal differences between iron-labeled and unlabeled bacteria regarding cytotoxicity  and invasive capacity .

most iron oxide particles have the formula fe23+o3fe2+o, embedding the bi- and trivalent iron ions in a crystalline structure, which is chemically protected by molecular coatings. in our labeling procedure the iron particles are attached to the cell wall instead of being incorporated by the bacteria. this approach avoids bactericidal iron ions entering the bacteria, which may otherwise lead to toxic effects as described for iron complexes  <cit> .

one of the most important types of immune cells recognizing invading bacteria in vivo, are macrophages. therefore, we investigated in in vitro experiments whether bacteria carrying iron particles can still induce phagocytotic responses of macrophages. after adding iron-labeled bacteria to a suspension of murine macrophages, live microscopy showed that macrophages immediately started phagocytizing the labeled bacteria . these data show that iron labeling does not abrogate phagocytosis.

binding stability
for the use of mri to detect and track bacteria in animal models, it is of the utmost importance that the label is conserved over time and bacteria remain detectable after several growth cycles. electron microscopy showed that ionps remained bound to the surface after cell division and were passed on to the daughter cells . thus, each cell division step continuously led to a dilution of ionps. to determine how fast the iron on the cell wall is diluted during cell growth and to estimate the minimum iron concentration that is detectable by mri, growth curves of labeled bacteria were measured using an initial inoculum of an od  value of  <dig> . every hour od values and cfu  counts were determined and corresponding t <dig>  and t <dig>  values were measured at  <dig>  t from a sample diluted to the initial cell concentration of  <dig>  od. prior to mri measurements the corresponding cell samples were separated from the medium and were embedded in  <dig> μl of  <dig> % agarose. while t <dig> did not change significantly over the time course, t <dig> was significantly decreased at the beginning of the growth curve and increased steadily until a stationary value was reached after  <dig> h . according to the od values and cfu counts, the cell density increased 35-fold during the first  <dig> h which resulted in a cell concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml. this observation confirmed that the binding of ionps to the cell surface is stable and can be detected at least over five cycles of cell division. to assess the sensitivity and reliability of detection, we reversed the culture experiment and measured t <dig> of bacteria cultures labeled with a serial two-fold dilution of ionps . the corresponding t <dig> values indicated that bacteria were labeled to saturation for the initial dilution steps. from the third dilution on, t <dig> increased continuously with decreasing amount of iron. the t <dig> relaxation times measured after different cell division cycles  correlated well with those obtained from cells labeled with different iron dilutions. t <dig> relaxation times of  <dig> ms and  <dig> ms, which were measured with a 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> iron dilution were also obtained from the growth curve at  <dig>  h and  <dig> h, perfectly corresponding to three and five cell divisions.

in vivo mouse models
for mammalian cells it has been shown previously that very low cell numbers, down to a single cell, can be detected and tracked by mri  <cit> . due to the very small size of bacteria  and the different labeling procedure, the feasibility of detection as well as its limits had to be assessed. to this end a local skin infection was induced by subcutaneous administration of either ionp-labeled or unlabeled s. aureus in the left flank of the mice. formation of an ulcer  <dig> h post infection was obvious in mr images, showing the resulting edema as extended hyperintensity . s. aureus colonies were identified as clearly circumscribed hypointensities in t2*-weighted images . while t2*-weighting enhances the size of the actual colony, ute  mri was able to visualize the extent of the colony more exactly . however, for lower numbers of bacteria the blooming effect of t2*-weighting was required to detect the bacteria. the mri detection limit of bacteria was assessed by infections with different numbers of labeled bacteria  . a circumscribed hypointensity within the zone of inflammation was still reliably detectable in t2*-weighted images for  <dig> bacteria cfus, the same order of magnitude as found for bli and fluorescence imaging  <cit> . electron microscopy and prussian blue staining of tissue sections  <dig> h post infection confirmed that ionps were still bound to the cell surface giving rise to the observed hypointensities. iron staining reproduced clusters of coccal-shaped bacteria observed in gram stained sections of the inflamed tissue . one of the big challenges in molecular mri is to quantify the negative contrast caused by iron particles. most studies have therefore focused on the qualitative assessment of hyper- and hypointense tissue contrast. only few approaches have so far quantitatively tracked iron labeled cells, using, for example, shifted spin echo ultrashort t2*  <cit>  or quantitative susceptibility mapping  <cit> . in our study, to quantify the amount of iron particles which is still bound on living bacteria  <dig> h post infection, we determined the iron concentration of bacterial colonies recovered from infected tissue on agar plates. from  <dig> cells, which were injected subcutaneously to induce the infection,  <dig>  ×  <dig> ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml per g tissue were recovered after  <dig> h, providing an iron content of  <dig>  μg fe per liter which corresponds to an iron concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg fe per cell. compared to the initial labeling efficiency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg fe, the iron concentration per cell is approximately diluted 10-fold. by magnetic separation, which acts on bacteria that carry the iron label,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the recovered bacteria population could be separated from homogenized tissue . however, the extracted bacterial number strongly depended on the iron distribution on single bacteria and bacterial clusters and, thus, represents only a rough estimation with pronounced variation between different tissue samples. after staining the recovered cell suspensions with syto  <dig>  the red fluorescence of the iron particles was co-localized with the detected bacteria , confirming that the iron was still bound to the bacteria. the presence of intact bacteria in the tissue homogenate was confirmed by gram and iron staining . to assess the fraction of phagocytosed bacteria,  <dig> h post infection, tissue sections were stained with macrophage and s. aureus-specific antibodies. intra- and extracellular bacteria were counted and averaged over  <dig> sections. only a small fraction of 10% of the total bacterial number was observed intracellularly .

the particular strength of mri for bacterial detection lies in its independence from metabolic activity and oxygenic environment, making it possible to also follow intracellular metabolically inactive s. aureus, such as the clinically highly relevant small colony variants  <cit> . for many bacterial pathogens and particularly for s. aureus, the intracellular persistence is increasingly recognized as an important infection and immune evasion strategy that causes chronic and therapy-refractory infections  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that s. aureus can invade and survive in different cell types, including professional phagocytes  <cit> . the use of iron labeled bacteria allowed us to track the surviving bacterial population in macrophages. iron of digested bacteria is also distributed by immune cells over the time course, but these give rise to a different mri pattern. macrophage labeling by i.v. injection of ionps  <dig> h and  <dig> h post infection resulted in a circumferential dark pattern at the border of the inflammation  without clear hypointensities that indicated bacterial colonies. histologically, large, not circumscribed areas of distributed iron were detected in zones of intense macrophage invasion . by contrast, after infection with iron labeled bacteria only sparely distributed single macrophages were labeled with prussian blue .

the feasibility to track s. aureus in vivo was demonstrated in a footpad infection model which regularly involves draining lymph nodes  <cit> . ionp-labeled s. aureus  were injected into the footpad, causing an inflammatory reaction . similar to the local infection model, labeled bacteria were detected at the site of injection . beyond that, distant from the injection site,  <dig> d and  <dig> d after infection labeled bacteria were observed as hypointensities in the popliteal lymph node of the infected leg . in contrast, lymph nodes of the infected leg after injection of unlabeled bacteria showed swelling as a sign of a systemic infection, but no typical hypointensities . popliteal lymph nodes of the uninfected leg did not show signs of inflammation and lymph nodes of mice being injected with iron particles only, did not show hypointensities . electron microscopy, gram and prussian blue staining of tissue sections confirmed the presence of iron-labeled bacteria in the contrasted lymph nodes . these data show that disseminating bacteria are detectable by mri. even though bli is a well-established method of studying bacterial infections in animal models and is superior to mri with regards to ease of use, cost and scan time, it is strictly limited to preclinical studies. mri on the other hand is directly amenable to study human subjects. our mri approach to track bacteria in vivo, raises hope that this modality can be transferred into the clinics in the future, when pathogen-specific contrast agents have become available.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have established a novel modality for in vivo detection and tracking of bacteria, which is complementary to bli. with the application of pre-labeled bacteria, the method is limited to use in animal models, as is bli. the great advantage of mri is the simultaneous imaging of morphology, organ compartments and immune response together with the data on bacterial tracking. additionally, mri detection is also applicable to metabolically less active as well as anaerobic bacteria and not subject to limited penetration depth. therefore, we are confident that this modality greatly enhances the diagnostic and analytical options in fundamental and translational research on bacterial infections.
