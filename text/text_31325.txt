BACKGROUND
new sequencing strategies are constantly under development and are currently able to process a large number of samples with great efficiency in a short period of time. however, accurate annotation of the resulting sequenced genomes has become the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition. conventionally, most genome sequences are annotated with multiple gene prediction algorithms such as glimmer, critica, and genemark, or by manual assignment based on blast search results  <cit> . gene density is sufficiently high in prokaryotes, such that coding sequences  frequently overlap. moreover, exon-intron structures present in eukaryotic genomes also make computational annotation difficult. these annotations are rarely experimentally validated, though in silico annotation methods could be executed with both high speed and good coverage  <cit> . the predicted genes exhibit frequent errors, particularly in false recognition of alternative start codons, underestimate of short cdss, misannotation of pseudogenes, and confusion over overlapping genes. previous studies have demonstrated that error rates in the definition of translation start sites  varied from 10% to 40% in some bacterial and archaeal genomes, according to different computational methods used  <cit> . likewise, after analysis of overlaps larger than  <dig> bp among  <dig> prokaryotic genomes, it was found that the annotation of most previously identified genes was incorrect  <cit> . in these cases, computational methods were unable to recognize mutations induced by sequencing errors, such as frame-shifts and stop codon mutations. as such, there is a great need for further experimental validation or complementary annotation approaches for conventional genome annotation.

currently, mass spectrometry -based proteomic methods are used to address difficulties in gene annotation. unambiguous identification of proteins by ms is more explicit and confident than that from genomic sequence data alone. the high-throughput nature of shotgun proteomics makes this technology cost-effective and readily reliable to the automated genome annotation process  <cit> . integrating proteomic information into the genome annotation process, termed proteogenomics  <cit> , directly maps tandem mass spectrometry  spectra data against all six possible reading frames from raw genomic dna sequences, i.e., experimental proteomic data can be fed back to the genome to aid in the validation of predicted protein-coding genes, potentially avoiding any biases in the computer algorithm. proteogenomics analysis have already been applied to a number of sequenced prokaryotes and eukaryotes such as the mycoplasma pneumonia  <cit> , mycobacterium lepra  <cit> , shewanella oneldensis  <cit> , mycoplasma mobile  <cit> , toxplasma gondii  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , human  <cit>  and so on. as a complementary annotation approach, proteomic methods are important for improving the quality of genome annotation, especially for correction of start codon errors by the analysis of a new framework and sequencing of n-terminally acetylated peptides  <cit>  and discovery of novel genes missed in the computational genome annotation process  <cit> . although proteogenomics has made great progress in recent past years, it still highly depends on the results of ms identification, which has its inherent drawbacks, including over representation of highly expressed proteins/peptides and incomplete sampling. moreover, the sensitivity and throughput of mass spectrometers are also important factors to maximize the benefits of proteogenomic approaches.

shigella flexneri is the primary causative agent of endemic shigellosis in developing countries  <cit> . its genome shares a large proportion of chromosomal genes with the model organism e. coli. since  <dig>  the genomes of four representative strains of species in the family shigella spp. have been sequenced  <cit> . as such, it is an attractive target for proteogenomic annotation. in this study, we applied high-throughput shotgun proteomic technology to explore the comprehensive protein expression profile of s. flexneri 2a str. <dig>  we completely validated  <dig> protein products, including hundreds of hypothetical proteins. we also corrected several start sites with the help of our original n-terminal extension database. furthermore, certain novel open reading frames  were confirmed by combining ms analysis and rt-pcr. our findings suggest that current genome annotations are not yet complete, and that proteogenomic tools have the potential to validate and complement genome wide annotation.

RESULTS
validation of annotated orfs in the s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> genome
raw ms/ms data were used to search a database containing all six possible reading frames of the entire s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> genome, using mascot version  <dig> . applying the filtering criteria described in the methods section,  <dig> orfs from all experiments were unambiguously assigned, of which  <dig> were previously annotated in the s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> genome database from ncbi. . on average, between  <dig> or  <dig> peptides were used to identify each orf, and the amino acid sequence coverage for the detected orfs averaged 13%. the distribution patterns of pi, mr, and grand average of hydropathicity  of the identified proteins were similar to those of all s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> annotated proteins . for example, the pi patterns of the identified proteins had the characteristic bimodal distribution, which was previously observed for bacterial and archaeal genomes  <cit> . moreover, these proteins  were involved in nearly all major biological processes . hypothetical proteins were likely to have been annotated incorrectly because of the lack of experimental evidence, and required further experimental validation. in our study,  <dig> hypothetical or putative orfs were validated at the protein level, representing 10% of the  <dig> predicted hypothetical proteins of s. flexneri 2a str. <dig>  this was below the average detection rate of all other annotated proteins. thus, these data suggested that a certain proportion of the hypothetical protein products do not exist in the organism, and represent misannotation of the corresponding genomic region  <cit> . the rest of the peptides that were detected with ms but did not match any annotated protein, are analyzed in detail below. a complete list of identified peptides and their quality scores are given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

correction of gene annotation errors
correction of start codon errors
traditionally, it has been difficult to correctly identify the tss within a given sequence. for example, a previous study of  <dig> annotated prokaryotic genomes showed that approximately 60% of the genes might have incorrectly-assigned tsss  <cit> . while accurate prediction of tsss is critical for defining protein sequences, as well as intergenic regions that might contain transcriptional regulatory elements  <cit> . tsss were usually verified by n-terminal sequencing analysis. this method was often technically demanding and was not amenable to the majority of proteins with 'blocked', and therefore inaccessible, n-termini  <cit> . to amend the approximate location of tsss in these sequences, we developed a proteomic strategy that is simpler than n-terminal sequencing and is also capable of high-throughput analysis, as it is possible that wrongly assigned start sites could be validated and corrected in a single experiment using this method.

all ms-derived peptides were screened against both the s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> protein database  and the customized n-terminal extension database . peptide hits using the latter indicated that the 5' end of the corresponding gene should be expanded. as a result, three genes  were identified as having true start codons upstream of their current start codons . in addition, by performing a blastp search against genbank, the n-terminus extended proteins other than the original proteins shared higher similarities with their homologs in other bacteria . moreover, we successfully designed primers based on the n-terminal extension region for rt-pcr experiments to confirm the existence of the three extended genes , suggesting that the n-terminal extensions inferred by our method were reliable. the initial codons of all three genes were corrected and updated in genbank entries based on our new evidence. this original strategy of combining both n-terminal proteomic analysis and transcriptional verification represents an effective and promising means for experimental identification of tsss. we expect that this strategy can be applied to other organisms.

correction of sequencing errors
although genome sequencing technologies have made great progress in the last  <dig> years, none of these next-generation sequencing methods are 100% accurate. there are usually a few wrong bases in an otherwise accurate genome. with the aid of proteogenomic tools, we could uncover genes that contained certain avoidable sequencing errors, which usually led to erroneous annotations. for example, we found an orf  in s. flexneri 2a str. <dig>  which was  <dig> bp shorter at the 3' end than its homologs in other shigella genomes. however, our ms/ms data identified peptides matching the missing part of fusa  in s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> . to test if a stop codon mutation resulted from a sequencing error, we re-sequenced the coding region of fusa and found that the guanine at genome position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> was previously recognized as thymine, because of a mistake in the initial genome sequencing project. this sequencing error led to a transformation from gaa  to the premature termination codon taa . as a result, the 3' end of the fusa gene annotated in s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> should be extended from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  importantly, this gene is now seen to encode a full-length protein product.

bacterial pseudogenes were originally considered to be infrequent. despite having dna sequences similar to those of known genes, pseudogenes were regarded as disabled copies of functional genes  <cit> . nonetheless, we detected two peptide segments matching the protein product of the zwf  pseudogene, which was orthologous to e. coli k <dig> glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase . was the zwf gene in s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> a true pseudogene? further re-sequencing of the regional genomic sequence revealed that there was an extra adenine insertion into the coding region of zwf in the original s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> genome sequence, which resulted in frame-shift introducing a premature stop codon . as such, based on our proteogenomic finds, the zwf pseudogene in s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> was revised to encode a functional full-length product. the yraj gene, which encodes an outer membrane usher protein in other enterobacteria, was disrupted by an is <dig> insertion sequence in s. flexneri 2a str. <dig>  using the six-reading-frame database search, we identified this pseudogene's premature protein product . its transcript was also detected by rt-pcr . previous studies revealed that the intact usher protein assembled in the om as a dimeric secretion complex  <cit> . from an evolutionary standpoint, it has been considered that transcribed/translated pseudogenes were not necessarily without function. how the premature protein functions remains to be determined.

discovery of novel orfs
the most striking result of our study was the identification of novel orfs. all assigned orfs were aligned with the current annotated orfs of s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> using blastp, and those that aligned with annotated proteins were discarded. as a result, we detected  <dig> novel orfs that were not predicted in s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> by any other annotation pipelines . among these novel orfs, four orfs have orthologs in other closely-related organisms, which allowed substantial cross-species validation of the new genes. significantly, the other three orfs were completely novel genes that had no homology with other annotated proteins from any species.

a) no, orfs not overlapping other genes; partial , orfs partially overlapping known genes on the complementary strand; partial , orfs partially overlapping known genes on the same strand; nested , orfs completely contained within known genes on the complementary strand; nested , orfs completely contained within known genes on the same strand, but in a different frame.

b) the transcripts of novel orfs were confirmed by rt-pcr assay.

we focused on the seven novel genes to further investigate why they escaped computational prediction. first, these novel orfs were relatively short. to our knowledge, short cdss  are among the most difficult genomic features to predict and are often missed during the annotation process due to conservative calls  <cit> . on the other hand, most of the identified novel orfs were partially or entirely overlapped by annotated longer orfs . for gene prediction software, the percentage of missing genes is strongly correlated with the frequency of gene overlaps. in glimmer, the maximum overlap length is set to  <dig> bp by default  <cit> . generally, the relatively longer orf rather than its overlapping genes is likely to be retained. unfortunately, those omitted overlapping genes might be true genes  <cit> . as figure s <dig> shown, generally there were four patterns for the relative location of overlapping gene pairs. of the seven novel orfs, one orf  had no overlap with known genes and other three orfs  respectively belonged to pattern i or pattern ii, whose transcripts were easy to be verified by rt-pcr assays. the results showed that the transcripts of four orfs were specifically detected , and additional sequencing of these pcr products confirmed their identity. the rest three orfs  were entirely contained within the coding region of certain longer known genes , referred to as "nested" genes. although nested genes are quite rare in prokaryotic genomes, this kind of gene arrangement is beginning to be recognized, such as setba /pic in s. flexneri 2a  <cit> , ins5b /ins5a and hgta/yaaw in e. coli  <cit> , and pfl01_0939/cosa in p. fluorescens  <cit> . the existence of nested genes increases the organizational complexity of the genome structure, so it is not practical to investigate all gene arrangements during conventional genome annotation. as such, proteogenomic methods offer a promising avenue toward the experimental validation of nested genes at the protein level  <cit> .

short cdss remain largely unknown, even though small peptides encoded by short genes are involved in diverse functions, such as secretion, stress responses, metabolism, and gene regulation in bacteria  <cit> . we also examined the gene structure of each of the seven novel genes. in our study, there were no identifiable functional domains in the seven novel orfs, with the exception of bio <dig> and bio <dig>  bio <dig> contains an ymgb superfamily conserved domain, which is involved in biofilm development and stability. bio <dig> contains an abc_cysa_sulfate_importer conserved domain, which is involved in sulfate import, and whose ortholog in e. coli is annotated as a sulfate/thiosulfate transporter subunit. overlapping gene pairs were conserved among organisms for specific genes and functions. in addition, it was generally assumed that their expressions were correlated with host genes, which would reduce the need for more complex regulatory pathways and thus the regulation of gene expression would be more effective  <cit> . for example, of the setba /pic nested gene pair in s. flexneri 2a, the pic gene encodes mucinase, which is involved in mucosal colonization, and set1a and set1b encode the two subunits of the shet <dig> enterotoxin. the two partners were likely to be expressed reciprocally and function cooperatively  <cit> , which aided our further investigation of the function of nested gene pair. exploring these novel nested genes' biological functions and their coordination with host genes are under investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, the detection of annotation errors, such as incorrect start sites assignment, sequencing errors, and wrongly annotated pseudogenes, would prevent misannotation from being multiplied in future versions of the s. flexneri 2a str. <dig> genome. the findings of novel orfs would also provide a new clue to conduct functional research. moreover, some of the novel orfs were identified as overlapping genes, which increases our understanding of the complexity of the genome structure and reveals the underestimation of such gene arrangements. this updated dataset would be very helpful for those interested in this pathogen to unearth certain information previously omitted. with the rapid development of proteomic technology, all sequence-based genome projects could be supplemented by the proteogenomic analysis.
