BACKGROUND
topors is nuclear protein that is widely expressed in human tissues  <cit> , and is the first example of protein that is capable of functioning as both a ubiquitin and sumo e <dig> ligase  <cit> . furthermore, expression analyses and genetic studies have implicated topors as a tumor suppressor in colon, lung, brain, and prostate malignancies  <cit> .

in proliferating cells, topors localizes in nuclear foci, many of which co-localize with pml nuclear bodies  <cit> . while identified originally as a topoisomerase i- and p53-binding protein, human topors and a drosophila ortholog were shown to function as ring-dependent e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, with substrates including p <dig>  the hairy transcription factor, and the homeodomain protein nkx <dig>   <cit> . additional studies indicated that topors could act as an e <dig> sumo ligase for p <dig> and topoisomerase i, with the ring domain dispensable for this function  <cit> . furthermore, a recent proteomic study identified several proteins involved in chromatin regulation, including sin3a, as potential sumoylation substrates for topors  <cit> . while a drosophila ortholog was shown to be required for proper functioning of a chromatin insulator  <cit> , physiologically relevant ubiquitination/sumoylation substrates and the biological role of topors remain poorly understood.

to gain insight into the function of topors, we generated a topors-deficient mouse strain using a gene-trapped allele. although mice homozygous for the mutant allele frequently died during the perinatal period, heterozygous mice appeared normal but had an increased rate of malignancy.

RESULTS
targeted disruption of topors in mice
topors-deficient mice were created from a gene-trapped embryonic stem cell line. the mutant cell line expresses a fusion transcript including exons  <dig> and  <dig> of topors, with exon  <dig> replaced by vector-derived β-galactosidase sequence . since exon  <dig> contains most of the topors coding sequence , including the highly-conserved ring domain  required for ubiquitination activity  <cit> , and the 437- <dig> region involved in sumoylation activity  <cit> , the protein derived from the fusion transcript is expected to lack both the ubiquitin and sumo ligase activities attributed to topors.

mice heterozygous for the mutant allele appeared phenotypically normal and were interbred to obtain homozygotes. analyses of topors mrna expression as a function of genotype indicated that similar to human tissues  <cit> , topors transcription was detectable in several tissues from topors+/+ mice, including brain, colon, kidney, and liver . transcripts containing exon  <dig> were undetectable in colon tissue obtained from mice homozygous for the mutant allele, whereas these transcripts were readily detected in colon tissue from topors+/+ and topors+/- mice . similarly, immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody developed against the human protein  <cit>  confirmed loss of topors protein expression in homozygote colon tissues .

genotyping of multiple heterozygote intercrosses indicated that topors-/- mice were present from day e <dig>  to birth at the expected mendelian ratio . however, topors-/- mice frequently died during the perinatal period and those that survived weaning were smaller than their littermates. mean adult male weights were  <dig> ±  <dig>  g ,  <dig> ±  <dig>  g , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g  for topors+/+, topors+/-, and topors-/- mice, respectively .

achi-square test for a non-mendelian distribution

in addition, topors-/- mice that survived weaning exhibited a high rate of mortality. predicted median survival for topors-/- mice that survived weaning was  <dig> weeks compared to  <dig> weeks for wild-type littermates . necropsies of topors-/- mice did not disclose gross organ abnormalities or other obvious causes of death. however, spinal kyphosis was noted in two of seven topors-/- mice that survived weaning . this abnormality was not detected among wild-type littermates. both male and female topors-/- mice were fertile, indicating that topors is not required for production of functional ova and sperm.

increased incidence of tumors in mice containing a mutant topors allele
cohorts of topors+/+, topors+/-, and topors-/- mice were monitored for several months to investigate the incidence of tumor formation. in addition, necropsies were performed on all mice in these cohorts that died, to determine whether malignancy was present. a single tumor  was detected among  <dig> topors+/+ mice . by contrast, among  <dig> topors+/- mice,  <dig> tumors  of various histologies were identified in typically older mice, and occurred in both males and females . compared to topors+/+ mice, topors+/- mice had a 7-fold increase in risk of tumor development . this finding indicates that haploinsufficiency of topors is associated with an increased rate of malignancy in mice.

a small hepatoma was found in a topors-/- mouse that died at  <dig> weeks of age. no malignancies were detected during necropsy of three other topors-/- mice that survived beyond  <dig> weeks . since the median age at which tumors were detected in topors+/- mice was  <dig> weeks, the high perinatal mortality rate in topors-/- mice may have confounded manifestation of an increase in cancer incidence in adult topors-/- mice.

topors-deficient primary embryonic fibroblasts exhibit slow growth and genetic instability
to investigate the cellular role of topors, as well as mechanisms underlying the increased rate of malignancy observed in mice with a mutant topors allele, we analyzed early passage, topors-deficient e <dig>  primary murine embryonic fibroblasts . expression of topors rna and protein was detectable in topors+/+ pmefs, but not in topors-/- pmefs . early passage topors-/- pmefs exhibited a slower growth rate and reached plateau earlier than wild-type cells . calculated doubling time for the topors+/+ cells was  <dig>  days versus  <dig>  days for topors-/- cells . cell cycle analyses indicated that deficiency of topors had little effect on cell cycle distribution .

to investigate whether loss of topors was associated with an increase in the rate of cellular transformation, we examined the ability of topors-/- pmefs to form foci on a monolayer of cells, and to form colonies in soft agar. in contrast to wild-type cells, topors-/- pmefs frequently obtained an ability to grow as foci . similarly, topors-/- pmefs were capable of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar . these results are consistent with topors functioning as a tumor suppressor.

since loss of topors results in a decrease in cellular proliferation in pmefs , it is unlikely that topors functions as a "gatekeeper"-type tumor suppressor  <cit> . to investigate whether loss of topors affected genetic stability , we analyzed karyotypes in early passage pmefs. among  <dig> topors+/+ cell metaphases,  <dig>  contained the expected diploid number of  <dig> chromosomes, with one exhibiting tetraploidy, and only two exhibiting aneuploidy . by contrast,  <dig> of  <dig>  metaphases from topors-/- cells were neither diploid nor tetraploid, with chromosome counts ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . when metaphases from topors+/- cells were examined, the aneuploidy rate was found to be similar to that of topors+/+ cells, with 3/ <dig>  of metaphases exhibiting aneuploidy .

since aneuploidy conferred by caretaker-type tumor suppressors is often related to defects in dna repair, we analyzed the sensitivity of topors-deficient pmefs to ionizing radiation and to the dna-damaging  drug topotecan. the results indicated that loss of topors did not sensitize pmefs to dna damage induced by either ionizing radiation or topotecan . similarly, deficiency of topors did not result in an increase in dna double strand breaks in untreated pmefs as assessed by analysis of phosphorylated h2ax  foci . furthermore, no intra-chromosomal rearrangements were detected in metaphase chromosomes from topors-/- cells that were analyzed using spectral karyotyping . together, these results indicate that deficiency of topors results in genetic instability manifested by an increased rate of aneuploidy without an increase in sensitivity to dna-damaging agents. these results suggest an underlying defect in chromosomal segregation, but not dna repair, in topors-/- pmefs.

next, we investigated dysfunction of the mitotic spindle and the spindle checkpoint as possible causes of aneuploidy in topors-deficient cells. topors+/+ and topors-/- pmefs exhibited similar arrest in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle after a  <dig> hour exposure to the microtubule-targeting drug vinblastine . similar were results were obtained after a  <dig> hour exposure to vinblastine , and deficiency of topors did not affect cellular sensitivity to this drug . these results indicate that the mitotic spindle checkpoint is intact in topors-deficient cells. in addition, as assessed by α-tubulin immunoflourescence studies, there was no evidence of multipolar spindles or abnormal microtubule architecture in topors-/- pmefs .

alterations in pericentric heterochromatin and high molecular weight sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates in topors-deficient primary embryonic fibroblasts
alterations in pericentric chromatin are implicated in aneuploidy  <cit> , and studies of both human and drosophila topors orthologs implicate topors in chromatin regulation. to investigate centromeric function and pericentric heterochromatin in topors-deficient pmefs, we analyzed the localization of heterochromatin protein 1α , which is associated with centromeric regions during interphase and is required for proper chromosomal segregation  <cit> . as expected in interphase topors+/+ pmefs, hp1α was predominantly localized in dapi-rich, pericentric foci . by contrast, in interphase pmefs lacking topors, few cells exhibited pericentric concentration of hp1α, with most cells exhibiting a diffuse nuclear localization of the protein . loss of topors did not affect the nuclear content of hp1α as assessed by immunoblotting . since hp1α is required for cohesin recruitment to centromeres  <cit> , mislocalization of hp1α provides an explanation for the aneuploidy observed in topors-deficient pmefs.

hp1α localization to pericentric regions has been shown to require both methylation of lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig>  as well as small interfering rnas originating from pericentric repetitive dna  <cit> . deficiency of topors did not affect the pericentric enrichment of trimethylated h3k <dig> in interphase cells, or the overall nuclear content of trimethylated h3k <dig> as assessed by immunoblotting . similarly, no difference was observed in the diffuse nuclear distribution of h3k <dig> acetylation in immunofluorescence studies of interphase pmefs, or in total h3k <dig> acetylation in topors-/- versus topors+/+ pmefs .

by constrast, studies of rna transcribed from pericentric  dna in pmefs demonstrated increased amounts of these transcripts in topors-/- pmefs compared to topors+/+ pmefs . these results suggest that the altered hp1α localization in topors-deficient pmefs may relate to an alteration in pericentric repetitive dna transcription.

since topors is capable of functioning as both a ubiquitin and sumo e <dig> ligase, the alterations in hp1α localization and pericentric dna transcription in topors-deficient pmefs may relate to loss of ubiquitination and/or sumoylation of a centromeric topors substrate. while further work is needed to identify topors substrates, we investigated whether deficiency of topors affected total levels of ubiquitin, sumo- <dig>  or sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates in pmefs. no differences in the pattern of ubiquitin or sumo- <dig> conjugates were observed in topors-/- pmefs compared to topors+/+ pmefs . in addition, the pattern of low molecular weight sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates was similar in topors-/- and topors+/+ pmefs . however, a small, but reproducible decrease was suggested in high molecular weight sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates in topors-/- pmefs compared to topors+/+ pmefs . recently, polymeric conjugation of sumo-2/ <dig> was implicated in centromeric function  <cit> , raising the intriguing possibility that the changes in pericentric heterochromatin observed in topors-deficient cells may relate to alteration in cellular levels of polymeric sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates.

deficiency of topors confers a transcriptional state similar to exposure to histone deacetylase inhibitors and results in resistance to trichostatin a
to gain additional insight into the cellular function of topors, we compared gene-expression profiles for topors+/+ and topors-/- pmefs. using the affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig> a array, rna was analyzed from three independent cultures of each cell type. selecting a false discovery rate of  <dig> ,  <dig> probe sets were identified as differentially expressed in topors+/+ versus topors-/- cells. among these  <dig> probe sets,  <dig> had at least a mean 3-fold alteration in transcript level, representing  <dig> genes:  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated in the topors-/- mefs . topors was identified as the most highly downregulated transcript in topors-/- mefs . we confirmed differential expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes using semi-quantitative rt-pcr .

many of the differentially expressed genes are implicated in tumorigenesis, and  <dig> of the upregulated genes are involved in the wnt pathway , which is dysregulated in a variety of cancers  <cit> . this finding is similar to a report implicating topors  in the transforming growth factor β signaling pathway  <cit> . in addition, among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig>  had identifiable human orthologs that allowed comparison to  <dig> gene expression profiles generated by treatment of human cell lines with  <dig> different small molecules: the "connectivity map"  <cit> . the gene expression profile associated with deficiency of topors showed strong similarity to the gene expression profiles associated with three different histone deacetylase inhibitors: hc toxin, trichostatin a, and vorinostat . the similarity of the topors deficiency signature to histone deacetylase inhibition is supported by the occurrence of several replicates with high connectivity scores, and by the finding that structurally distinct hdac inhibitors show this similarity . no other class of compounds was similarly represented among the gene expression profiles most highly ranked with the topors profile . in addition, when evaluating permuted results, which estimate the enrichment of specific compounds among the most highly ranked profiles, both vorinostat and trichostatin a were associated with low permutation p-values . together, these findings suggest that loss of topors generates a cellular state that is similar to that created by exposure of cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors.

to further explore the finding that loss of topors conferred a cellular state similar to that of histone deacetylase inhibition, we investigated the sensitivity of topors-deficient pmefs to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a. the results indicate that loss of topors confers a high level of resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of this compound . this characteristic is not associated with general resistance to anti-proliferative drugs, since topors-/- pmefs are not resistant to dna-damaging agents or to the microtubule-targeting drug vinblastine .

discussion
our studies indicate that mice lacking the dual ubiquitin and sumo e <dig> ligase topors are viable, but exhibit increased perinatal mortality and decreased weight, as well as decreased lifespan. since there are several ubiquitin and sumo e <dig> ligases in mammals  <cit> , it is not surprising that topors is dispensable for viability. our finding that steady state amounts of total cellular ubiquitin and sumo- <dig> conjugates in pmefs are unaffected by loss of topors is also consistent with redundancy of ubiquitin and sumo e <dig> ligases. however, the apparent decrease in high molecular weight sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates in topors-deficient pmefs suggests that topors may have a non-redundant role in regulation of polymeric sumo-2/ <dig> chains. we note that a similar specific role for topors in polymeric  sumo conjugation was identified in studies of topors-induced sumoylation of topoisomerase i, although these studies employed sumo- <dig> transfections and did not examine sumo-2/ <dig>  <cit> .

similar to our results, an increase in perinatal mortality as well as decreased weight were reported in mice lacking the sumo e <dig> ligase pias <dig>  <cit> , although total sumo- <dig> and sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates were unaffected in thymocytes from pias1-deficient mice  <cit> . a decrease in the expected number of homozygotes from heterozygote matings was observed in mice lacking the related sumo e <dig> ligase piasy, although this was strain dependent, and mice lacking piasy were phenotypically normal  <cit> . loss of piasy did not affect total sumo- <dig> or sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates in mefs  <cit> . loss of the sumo e <dig> ligase ranbp <dig> results in embryonic lethality  <cit> . the effect of ranbp <dig> deficiency on cellular sumo conjugates was not reported in this study  <cit> . analogous to mice lacking pias <dig>  there were no gross organ defects in mice homozygous for the mutant topors allele, and additional studies will be necessary to determine the etiology of both the perinatal mortality as well as the decreased lifespan observed in topors-deficient mice.

our finding that deficiency of topors results in an increased rate of malignancy in mice supports previous analyses implicating topors as a tumor suppressor in various human malignancies  <cit> . moreover, our studies of primary embryonic fibroblasts provide the first evidence that loss of topors confers genetic instability. specifically, complete loss of topors results in a high rate of aneuploidy, which is due to a defect in mitotic chromosome segregation, rather than a defect in dna repair. similar to other tumor suppressor genes involved in chromosome segregation rather than dna repair, malignancies in topors-deficient mice occurred predominantly in older mice, and in a variety of tissues  <cit> . notably, the finding that topors+/- pmefs did not exhibit an increased rate of aneuploidy suggests that additional events, such as alteration of the remaining wild-type allele, underly the increase in tumorigenesis observed in topors+/- mice.

studies of the mechanisms underlying the chromosome segregation defect in topors-deficient pmefs indicated that loss of topors did not affect the mitotic checkpoint, but resulted in altered pericentric heterochromatin, manisfested by mislocalization of pericentic hp1α as well as increased transcription from pericentric major satellite repetitive dna. this finding suggests a role for topors in pericentric heterochromatin maintenance, and adds to several lines of evidence implicating topors in chromatin regulation. first, topors co-localizes with pml nuclear bodies in human cells  <cit> . among other functions, pml nuclear bodies were shown to contain pericentric satellite dna and hp1α, and were specifically implicated in establishment of pericentric heterochromatin  <cit> . similarly, although the human antibody was not able to recognize murine topors in immunohistochemical studies, cell fractionation studies of pmefs indicated that the majority of the topors protein was present in a fraction containing chromatin and nuclear matrix components .

second, a drosophila topors  ortholog interacts with mod <dig> , a member of the gypsy transposon chromatin insulator complex  <cit> . chromatin insulators are dna sequences defined according to an ability to both block enhancer-promoter communication, and to shield genes from silencing conferred by nearby chromatin modifications such as histone deacetylation  <cit> . in genetic studies, dtopors was shown to be required for gypsy insulator function, and the dtopors protein was shown to co-localize with nuclear lamin  <cit> . in mammals, insulators are important in genomic imprinting, which results in expression of only the maternal or paternal allele  <cit> . notably, among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes identified in our transcriptional profiling analysis of topors-deficient pmefs,  <dig> were identified as being imprinted by an expression profiling screen  <cit>  . among these, xist and peg <dig> are well-known imprinted genes  <cit> . notably, the transcription of other imprinted genes, such as igf <dig> and u2af1-rs <dig>  was not identified as altered in topors-/- pmefs, indicating that loss of topors does not result in global deregulation of imprinting.

third, a search for topors sumoylation substrates using a proteomic in vitro screen yielded several chromatin-related proteins  <cit> . among these potential substrates, krab-associated protein  <dig> /transcription intermediary factor 1-beta , histone h <dig>  and ku <dig> are known to interact with hp- <dig> proteins  <cit> . in addition, the p <dig> subunit of chromatin assembly factor  <dig>  was identified as a putative topors substrate  <cit> , with caf <dig> implicated in recruitment of hp-1α to pericentric heterochromatin  <cit> . furthermore, msin3a was identified as a potential topors sumoylation substrate, and transfection studies indicated that topors is capable of sumoylating msin3a in cells  <cit> . since alterations in msin3a function lead to chromosomal and genomic instability and accelerate tumorigenesis  <cit> , it is possible that loss of sumoylation or ubiquitination of msin3a or other chromatin proteins by topors is important in the altered pericentric heterochromatin observed in topors-deficient mefs.

in this regard, there are several examples of heterochromatin and chromosome segregation defects conferred by alterations in components of ubiquitination or sumoylation pathways in eukaryotes. deficiency of the ubiquitin e <dig> ligase brca <dig> results in chromosomal instability  <cit> , as well as defects in the chromatin structure of x chromosomes  <cit> . brca <dig> localizes in pericentric heterochromatin regions in mefs  <cit>  and was also identified as a member of a swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex  <cit> . in addition, a ubiquitin e <dig> ligase complex containing cullin  <dig> was shown to be required for heterochromatin formation and proper chromosomal segregation in fission yeast  <cit> . interestingly, this e <dig> ligase was also shown to regulate transcription of centromeric repetitive dna in yeast  <cit> .

similarly, deficiency of the sumo-conjugating enzyme hus5/ubc <dig> results in abnormal chromosome segregation in fission yeast  <cit> , and in loss of gene silencing as well as altered histone modification patterns at heterochromatic regions  <cit> . murine cells lacking the sumo e <dig> enzyme ubc <dig> exhibit mitotic chromosome defects, including anaphase bridges  <cit> . knockdown of the sumo e <dig> ligase piasγ in human hela cancer cells results in a defect in mitotic chromosome segregation, possibly due to loss of topoisomerase ii sumoylation  <cit> . loss of pli1p, a pias ortholog in fission yeast, also results in chromosomal instability and reduced transcriptional silencing of centromeric dna  <cit> .

although further studies are needed to determine if the ubiquitination or sumoylation activities of topors are required for maintenance of pericentric heterochromatin, our finding that loss of topors may result in a decrease in polymeric sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates adds to increasing evidence implicating polymeric sumo-2/ <dig> chains in centromere function. for example, polymeric sumo-2/ <dig> conjugates are implicated in localization of topoisomerase iiα to centromeres  <cit> , and are required for localization of cenp-e to kinetochores  <cit> .

our studies of topors-deficient cells are also relevant to the recent discovery of histone deacetylases as therapeutic targets in cancer  <cit> . loss of topors results in resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors, without affecting cellular sensitivity to dna-damaging or microtubule-targeting agents. interestingly, aneuploidy, mislocalization of hp1α, as well as decreased silencing of pericentric dna  <cit> , occur in cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our studies indicate that mice lacking the dual ubiquitin and sumo e <dig> ligase topors are viable, but exhibit increased perinatal mortality and decreased weight, as well as decreased life span. complete loss of topors results in a high rate of aneuploidy in primary embryonic fibroblasts, which is due to a defect in mitotic chromosome segregation, rather than a defect in dna repair. studies of the mechanisms underlying the chromosome segregation defect in topors-deficient pmefs indicated that loss of topors did not affect the mitotic checkpoint, but resulted in altered pericentric heterochromatin, manifested by mislocalization of pericentic hp1α as well as increased transcription from pericentric major satellite repetitive dna. these results indicate a unique role for topors in maintenance of genomic stability and pericentric heterochromatin. loss of topors also resulted in resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors. since relatively little is known regarding mechanisms of resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitors, elucidation of the mechanisms by which loss of topors confers resistance to these drugs may be useful in efforts to maximize their effectiveness in the treatment of patients with cancer.
