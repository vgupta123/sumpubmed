BACKGROUND
microorganisms play an essential role in shaping the natural environment. they have evolved specific metabolic pathways allowing them to utilise a wide range of substrates, many of which are toxic to higher organisms. through the conversion of both anthropogenic and naturally occurring pollutants to less toxic products, such microorganisms effect widespread natural bioremediation. an important toxic compound is arsenic, a metalloid that can cause multiple health effects including diabetes, hypertension, skin lesions and skin and internal cancers  <cit> . arsenic occurs in soils and water bodies both naturally and as a result of anthropogenic processes. a major anthropogenic source is the mining industry, where the processing of sulfide ores produces large quantities of sulfidic wastes which may be rich in arsenic-bearing compounds such as arsenopyrite. the weathering of these minerals leads to the formation of acid mine drainage , generally characterised by elevated sulfate, iron and other metal concentrations  <cit> , and thus the transport of many toxic elements such as inorganic forms of arsenic, arsenite ) and arsenate ). this often results in chronic and severe pollution of the surrounding environment, with a substantial reduction of the indigenous biota.

numerous arsenic-oxidising microorganisms, especially proteobacteria, are able to oxidise as to as in order to detoxify their immediate environment. this biological as oxidation is of particular importance, as being more soluble and more toxic than as  <cit> . additionally, in acidic environments such as those impacted by amd, natural remediation can occur as a result of the concurrent oxidation of ferrous iron and arsenite, leading to the coprecipitation of both  <cit> . therefore, understanding factors that influence the competitiveness, diversity and role of these organisms is an essential step in the development of bioremediation systems treating arsenic contaminated environments.

certain bacterial strains are able to use arsenite as an electron donor. by gaining energy, as well as removing the more toxic arsenic species, such bacteria may gain an advantage over other microorganisms  <cit> . arsenite oxidase, the enzyme catalysing as-oxidation, has been well characterised in several bacterial strains  <cit> . an important group of as-oxidising bacteria belong to the thiomonas genus, and are ubiquitous in arsenic-contaminated environments  <cit> . thiomonas strains are able to gain energy from the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds   <cit> , and are defined as facultative chemolithoautotrophs which grow optimally in mixotrophic media containing riscs and organic supplements. these bacteria are also capable of organotrophic growth  <cit> . the original description comprised thiomonas cuprina, t. intermedia, t. perometabolis and t. thermosulfata  <cit> . thiomonas perometabolis was isolated from soil at a building site in los angeles, u.s.a., as thiobacillus perometabolis  <cit> . it was differentiated from thiobacillus intermedius  as it was apparently unable to grow autotrophically. however, katayama-fujimura and kuraishi  <cit>  have since suggested that this is not true. recently described species include thiomonas. arsenivorans  <cit>  and the thiomonas strains 3as  <cit> , ynys <dig>  <cit>  and wj <dig>  <cit> . thiomonas sp. 3as was obtained from the carnoul√®s mine tailings, southern france  <cit> . it was shown that this bacterium could gain energy from the oxidation of arsenic. the presence of carboxysomes and the detection of the cbbsl genes encoding ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, led the authors propose that this strain may be able to fix co <dig>  t. arsenivorans was isolated from another arsenic-rich mine residue at the cheni former gold mine, limousin, france  <cit> . the cheni site is not very acidic , but is highly contaminated with arsenic   <cit> . t. arsenivorans has been shown to oxidise arsenic and ferrous iron, and is able to grow autotrophically using arsenic as the sole energy source  <cit> . strain ynys <dig> was isolated from ferruginous waters which have been draining from an adit since the closure of several coal mines near to the village of ynysarwed, wales, u.k.  <cit> . the waters were of relatively neutral ph  with elevated iron loading  and have led to significant pollution of the area  <cit> . strain wj <dig> was the dominant isolate obtained from effluent draining all three of the compost bioreactors of a pilot-scale bioremediation plant receiving water from the wheal jane tin mine, cornwall, u.k.  <cit> . both wj <dig> and ynys <dig> are known to oxidise ferrous iron, while wj <dig> has been shown to oxidise arsenite  <cit> .

these five strains are interesting in terms of arsenic metabolism: t. arsenivorans, wj <dig> and 3as are able to oxidise as, while ynys <dig> and t. perometabolis are not. moreover, t. arsenivorans and 3as present interesting physiological traits, in particular that these strains are able to use as as an electron donor. however, differences between thiomonas strains in the way they have adapted and respond to arsenic have never been studied further. the connection between carbon and arsenic metabolism in these strains, particularly inorganic carbon assimilation and arsenite as energy source, has never been compared. therefore, analysis was undertaken to examine these physiological aspects in these five thiomonas strains.

RESULTS
phylogenetic, phenotypic and genotypic analyses of the five thiomonas strains
phylogenetic analyses of amplified 16s rrna and rpoa gene products confirmed the occurrence of two distinct monophyletic groups as had been suggested previously  <cit> . supergene analysis  was performed using concatenated 16s rrna and rpoa gene sequences of each strain. these results placed t. perometabolis with wj <dig> and ynys <dig>  along with thiomonas sp. 3as, these strains grouped together in group i, while t. arsenivorans was part of group ii.

various tests were carried out to examine the physiological response of the five strains to arsenic. this was coupled with a pcr-based approach to determine the presence of genes involved in arsenic metabolism. in agreement with previous data, strains 3as, wj <dig> and t. arsenivorans oxidised arsenite to arsenate in liquid media whereas t. perometabolis and ynys <dig> did not . the aoxab genes encoding the arsenite oxidase large and small subunits of thiomonas sp. 3as and t. arsenivorans have previously been characterised  <cit> . positive pcr results using primers which targeted a region of the aoxab genes were obtained with dna from all strains except ynys <dig> and t. perometabolis. the aoxab genes of wj <dig> were much more divergent than those of t. arsenivorans and 3as . this is in agreement with previous findings showing that the aoxb gene of wj <dig> groups neither with t. arsenivorans nor the group i thiomonads  <cit> , . the inability of t. perometabolis and ynys <dig> to oxidise arsenite further implied that the aox operon was absent in these strains.

the mic of as for strains 3as, wj <dig> and t. arsenivorans was  <dig> mm, higher than for strains ynys <dig> and t. perometabolis . additionally, strain ynys <dig> was more sensitive to as than the other strains. arsenic resistance in bacteria is in part due to the expression of aox genes but also of the ars arsenic-resistance genes  <cit> . among these, arsc encodes an arsenate reductase and arsa and arsb encode an arsenite efflux pump. analysis of the thiomonas sp. 3as genome  revealed the presence of two copies of the arsb gene, denoted arsb <dig> and arsb <dig>  these genes were found to be distantly related, sharing just  <dig> % sequence identity. in order to compare the occurrence, copy number and type of ars genes present in the different thiomonas strains, pcr amplifications using generic arsb primers were performed. as expected, rflp and sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the arsb <dig> and arsb <dig> genes in strain 3as . in contrast, only the arsb <dig> gene could be detected using dna from t. perometabolis, ynys <dig> and wj <dig>  even when internal primers specific for the arsb <dig> gene were used. conversely, only the arsb <dig> gene was detected in t. arsenivorans.

the phylogeny of the arsb <dig> and arsb <dig> genes was analysed, excluding the sequences obtained using the arsb <dig> internal primers that were too short. the arsb <dig> gene sequence for strain 3as was taken directly from the annotated genome . the data showed that while they are all related to the arsb genes of leptospirillum spp. and acidithiobacillus caldus, the type  <dig> and type  <dig> genes formed two very distinct clades and have clearly diverged at an evolutionarily distant point in time .

the motility of herminiimonas arsenicoxydans, an arsenic-oxidising bacterium is greater in the presence of arsenite  <cit> . motility tests revealed that the five thiomonas strains reacted differently to the metalloid . strain t. perometabolis was found to be non-motile irrespective of arsenite concentrations. among the motile strains, three distinct phenotypes were observed: those for whom motility was not affected by arsenite concentration ; those who showed increased motility with increasing arsenite concentrations  and those who showed decreased motility with increasing arsenite concentration . wj <dig> was three to four times more motile than all of the other strains. a concentration of  <dig>  mm arsenite appeared to have an inhibitory effect on t. arsenivorans and wj <dig> motility .

all the physiological and genetic analyses revealed that the response to arsenic differed in the five thiomonas strains; some of these differences were correlated with differences in the genetic content.

as as an energy source, and the fixation of carbon dioxide
only t. arsenivorans, 3as and wj <dig> were able to grow in basal media with yeast extract as the sole energy source . during these growth experiments, soluble sulfate concentrations remained the same or decreased slightly , indicating that energy was gained from the oxidation of compounds other than any trace riscs in the yeast extract, most probably organic carbon. these observations suggest that all strains except ynys <dig> and t. perometabolis are organotrophic. all strains were able to grow in the presence of ye and thiosulfate . in these thiosulfate-amended cultures, sulfate concentrations increased following incubation , indicating that thiosulfate had been oxidised. this suggests that all strains were able to use this risc as an energy source and are therefore chemolithotrophic. in all cases, greater growth occurred in thiosulfate-amended cultures, suggesting that mixotrophic conditions are optimal for the growth of these strains. it was however observed that t. arsenivorans grew better in mcsm liquid medium, whereas t. perometabolis and ynys <dig> grew better in m <dig> medium . mcsm contains  <dig> times less thiosulfate and suggests that the optimal thiosulfate concentration is lower in the case of t. arsenivorans.

only t. arsenivorans was able to grow in basal media without yeast extract with either thiosulfate or arsenite as the sole energy source . although direct cell enumeration of t. perometabolis cultures was not possible due to its propensity to form flocs during growth, no growth, flocular or otherwise, was observed in the ye-free media. the growth of t. arsenivorans was stimulated by  <dig>  mm as in presence of  <dig>  g l- <dig> yeast extract, but this positive effect was no longer detected in presence of  <dig>  g l- <dig> yeast extract. the ability of t. arsenivorans to grow autotrophically using as as the sole energy source was confirmed by the observation of increasing quantities of carbon fixed as more as was oxidised . this demonstrated that t. arsenivorans was able to use energy gained from the oxidation of as to fix inorganic carbon. in contrast, strain 3as was unable to fix inorganic carbon under the same conditions , as  <dig>  mm as was found to inhibit growth in presence of  <dig>  or  <dig>  g l- <dig> yeast extract , and this strain was unable to grow in presence of as as the sole energy source.

enzymes involved in carbon metabolism and energy acquisition are expressed differently in t. arsenivorans and 3as in response to arsenic
protein profiles expressed in mcsm or m <dig> media, in the presence and absence of arsenic were compared in each strain . in both strains, arsenic-specific enzymes  were more abundant in the presence of as, suggesting that a typical arsenic-specific response occurred in both strains. arsa <dig> is part of the efflux pump with arsb <dig> and is encoded by the ars <dig> operon. moreover, expression of a putative oxidoreductase  was induced in the presence of arsenic. this protein is conserved in at. caldus, with 90% amino-acid identity . the at. caldus gene encoding this thi3148-like protein is embedded within an ars operon. this protein is also conserved in more than  <dig> other bacteria, for example in mycobacterium abscessus  and lactobacillus plantarum . in these two cases the corresponding gene was also found in the vicinity of ars genes.

a + and -: these proteins are more or less abundant in the presence of as, respectively. 0: no difference observed .

the expression of several proteins involved in other metabolic pathways changed, suggesting that in the presence of arsenic, the general metabolism of t. arsenivorans and 3as was modified. indeed, enzymes involved in glyoxylate metabolism were more abundant in the presence of arsenic, suggesting that expression of such proteins is regulated in response to arsenic in both strains. however, several changes observed were clearly different between both strains. in t. arsenivorans, two proteins involved in co <dig> fixation  and fructose- <dig> -biphosphatase) were more abundant when cells were grown in the presence of arsenic, whereas in thiomonas sp. 3as, such proteins were less abundant in the presence of as. in addition to these proteins, it was observed that enzymes involved in major carbon metabolism  or energy metabolism  were less abundant in 3as in the presence of as. this observation correlated with the phenotypic observation that the strain 3as grew better in the absence of arsenic .

discussion
two groups could be distinguished within the thiomonas strains studied: group i comprises all the strains in this study except t. arsenivorans, which is part of a second group, group ii. as described by moreira and amils  <cit> , all of the strains grew better in mixotrophic media containing both thiosulfate and organic supplements, and used riscs as an energy source. this suggests that lithotrophy is a general characteristic of the thiomonas genus. in contrast, neither strain ynys <dig> nor t. perometabolis could grow organotrophically in the absence of a reduced sulfur compound, suggesting that, despite previous findings, facultative organotrophy is not a general property of the thiomonas genus. to improve our understanding of these important arsenic-resistant bacteria, several metabolic and genetic properties were investigated. it appears that much greater physiological differentiation regarding arsenic response was possible between these thiomonas strains than may have been previously suggested. clearly organisms that are phylogenetically close can differ greatly physiologically, in particular concerning specific metabolic traits such as the metabolism of arsenic. for example, the effects of arsenic on the motility of all strains appeared to be somewhat random, and cannot easily be related to any of the phylogenetic or physiological data obtained. it is worth noting that both t. arsenivorans and wj <dig> strains exhibited increased motility in the presence of arsenic. this may indicate a potential energetic role of the element for these strains, as proposed for the arsenic-oxidising bacterium, h. arsenicoxydans  <cit> .

other physiological divergences concern arsenic resistance. ynys <dig> and t. perometabolis were approximately twice as sensitive to as as the other strains. moreover, the inhibitory effect of arsenite on ynys <dig> motility suggests a greater susceptibility of this strain to the metalloid. this could be due to the absence of aox or ars genes. indeed, these two strains are unable to oxidize as, probably as they lack aox genes. moreover, arsb <dig> genes were not detected in ynys <dig> and t. perometabolis. therefore, it is probable that these two strains have only a single set of arsenic resistance genes that can be expressed. interestingly, wj <dig> was found to be equally resistant to arsenic as these strains, yet no arsb <dig> gene could be amplified by pcr. the same is true for t. arsenivorans, for which no arsb <dig> gene was detected by pcr, yet it was again as resistant as those strains shown to possess both the ars <dig> and ars <dig> operons. one possible explanation is that wj <dig> possesses two copies of the ars <dig> operon and t. arsenivorans has two copies of the ars <dig> operon. alternatively, the higher resistance capacities of t. arsenivorans, thiomonas sp. 3as, and wj <dig>  as compared to ynys <dig> and t. perometabolis may be due to greater as oxidation capacity of these strains.

the arsenic response observed in t. arsenivorans and 3as revealed that the proteins involved in arsenic resistance  were more highly expressed in the presence of arsenic, as shown previously for h. arsenicoxydans  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and comamonas sp.  <cit> . therefore, such a feature seems to be a common arsenic response. in h. arsenicoxydans, other proteins that were shown to be more abundant in the presence of arsenic were involved in oxidative stress, dna repair and motility. in this study, such proteins  were induced in thiomonas sp. 3as whereas in t. arsenivorans, only general stress proteins were induced. these observations suggest that the response to the stress induced by arsenic involves different regulatory mechanisms in 3as and t. arsenivorans. contrary to this arsenic-specific response, the other arsenic-regulated proteins identified in the thiomonas strains did not share a similar expression pattern with other arsenic-resistant bacteria. thus it appears that while there may be a common arsenic response between all the bacteria, the general metabolism may be differentially adapted to each environment from which these strains originated. in particular, t. arsenivorans has unique traits in terms of arsenic, carbon and energy metabolism that distinguish it from the other strains examined.

thiomonas arsenivorans can grow autotrophically using either as or thiosulfate as the sole energy source. surprisingly, the differential protein expression analysis revealed that even in the presence of yeast extract, proteins involved in co <dig> fixation through the calvin-benson-bassham cycle and enzymes involved in the glycolysis/neoglucogenesis were expressed. in addition, it was shown in the present study that t. arsenivorans induces expression of carbon fixation-specific enzymes in the presence of arsenic. this observation was correlated with an increased co <dig> fixation efficiency when arsenic concentration increased. this suggests that an increase in cbb genes expression in the presence of arsenic improves its capacity to fix co <dig>  on the other hand, the opposite observation was seen with thiomonas sp. 3as. therefore, the proteomic results obtained from the present study suggest that these two thiomonas strains react differently to their arsenic-contaminated environments. the other differences observed concern dna metabolism, transcription and protein synthesis. it appears that, in the presence of arsenic, t. arsenivorans is still able to express proteins required for optimal growth whereas 3as is not.

CONCLUSIONS
these observations revealed that carbon assimilation, energy acquisition and arsenic metabolism of these strains are linked. however, they do not share a common mechanism, since metabolisms required for growth and carbon assimilation are stimulated in t. arsenivorans in the presence of arsenic, but repressed in thiomonas sp. 3as. further work is needed to test if a common mechanism occurs to regulate carbon assimilation and arsenic response in other thiomonas strains. however, to our knowledge, this is the first example of such a link between arsenic metabolism and carbon assimilation.
