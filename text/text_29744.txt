BACKGROUND
the chromosomal passenger complex  consisting of aurora b kinase, incenp , survivin and borealin/dasra b plays important roles during mitosis and cytokinesis  <cit> . one of the main aims of the cpc proteins is to ensure that aurora b is accessible to phosphorylate its various substrates like histone h <dig>  cenp-a, mklp <dig>  mcak, incenp, survivin, mgcracgap, vimentin, desmin and myosin-ii  <cit>  at the right time. thus, the cpc proteins regulate multiple mitotic events like chromosome segregation, operation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and cytokinesis  <cit> . how phosphorylation by aurora b affects the functions of its various substrates and hence influences cell division is not completely understood.

the cpc proteins concentrate at the inner-centromere during metaphase, migrate to the spindle midzone during anaphase and finally to midbody during cytokinesis  <cit> . the exact mechanism of this characteristic localization of the cpc is currently unknown, however clues are emerging. borealin and survivin can self-associate in vitro and in vivo and can also interact with each other  <cit> . borealin can bind to dna in vitro  <cit> . also, the bir-domain of survivin has been proposed to interact with the centromeres  <cit> . furthermore, a complex of borealin, survivin and the n-terminus of incenp  is capable of targeting to the centromere in vivo  <cit> . borealin and survivin may act as a scaffold to bring incenp and aurora b kinase to the centromere. incenp can bind to tubulin directly thereby targeting the cpc to the spindle midzone  <cit> .

several members of the cpc are regulated by post-translational modification. for example, incenp is phosphorylated by aurora b and cdk <dig>  both of which enhance the ability of incenp to activate aurora b  <cit> . also, the phosphorylation of incenp by cdk <dig> allows it to interact with plk <dig> and recruit it to the centromere  <cit> . there is also evidence that survivin is regulated by phosphorylation  <cit> . borealin co-localizes with aurora b kinase and can be phosphorylated at serine  <dig> by aurora b kinase in vitro  <cit> . here, we show that borealin is phosphorylated in vivo during mitosis as indicated by an electrophoretic mobility shift. aurora b is not required for this particular modification. mutation of s <dig>  potential aurora b kinase phosphorylation site, to alanine did not alter the mitotic phosphorylation of borealin or its localization to the centromere, spindle midzone or midbody indicating that other sites are targets of modification in vivo.

RESULTS
two electrophoretic forms of borealin in human cells
during our analysis of the expression of flag-tagged borealin protein, we periodically observed two bands. therefore, we transiently transfected hela cells with wt flag-borealin and separated the extracts by more extensive electrophoresis using a modified acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio . under these conditions, we found that borealin could be resolved into a doublet . the presence of two migrating forms suggests that borealin may be post-translationally modified in cells. furthermore, we observed that cells blocked in mitosis with nocodazole contained mostly the slowly migrating form whereas asynchronously growing cells contained the faster form . nocodazole arrests cells in mitosis by preventing microtubule polymerization which activates the spindle checkpoint. this raised two possibilities, either that borealin was modified as cells naturally entered mitosis, or that it was modified as a consequence of triggering the spindle checkpoint.

mitotic wt- <dig> cells collected by mitotic shake-off in the absence of nocodazole contained mostly the slowly migrating form of borealin, similarly to nocodazole blocked cells . this suggests that the modification of borealin that we have identified occurs as cells naturally enter mitosis, and is not a consequence of activation of the spindle checkpoint. in addition, the mitosis-specific mobility shift of wild-type borealin was observed in two independent stable clones that express different levels of the ectopic protein . this suggests that phosphorylation is not clone specific and can be seen when lower levels of the protein are expressed.

borealin is found in a complex with aurora b, a serine/threonine kinase that is active during mitosis and not interphase  <cit> . also, aurora b can phosphorylate serine  <dig> of borealin in vitro  <cit> . one possibility was that the mobility shift we observed during mitosis was due to phosphorylation of the protein by aurora b kinase. therefore, we mutated s <dig> and s <dig> to alanine  and transiently transfected the mutant into hela cells. borealin migrated as a doublet even when s165a was mutated to alanine  suggesting that phosphorylation of s <dig> is not required to generate the shifted form of borealin. also, the s165a form of borealin localized to the centromeres during metaphase, to the spindle midzone during anaphase and to the midbody during telophase similarly to wild-type borealin . by database searching, we found that t <dig> of borealin conforms to the consensus for cdk <dig> phosphorylation. similarly to s164/ <dig>  mutation of t <dig> to alanine did not reduce the mobility shift of the protein in mitosis and had no effect on its subcellular localization .

analysis of endogenous borealin
to analyze endogenous borealin, we raised an antiserum to the human protein. asynchronously growing and mitotic hela cells were assessed by western blotting to determine if endogenous borealin showed a mobility shift. western blot analysis of untransfected, hela cells using the antibody to borealin revealed the presence of two electrophoretic forms of borealin . also, mitotic cells showed an increase in the slowly migrating form of borealin similar to the flag-tagged borealin. western blot analysis of wt- <dig> cells containing the flag-tagged borealin using our antibody to borealin revealed four bands during mitosis, with the upper two bands being recognized by the antibody to the flag-tag . the slower migration of the flag-tagged borealin is apparently due to the extra  <dig> amino acids comprising the tag. also, the flag-tagged borealin in wt- <dig> cells appears to be less abundant than the endogenous protein. these results indicate that our observations with the flag-tagged protein are not due to overexpression.

phosphorylation of borealin during mitosis
to determine if the electrophoretic mobility shift of borealin is due to phosphorylation, mitotic extracts of hela cells transiently transfected with flag- borealin were treated with phosphatase for one and four hours and as a control, with phosphatase and phosphatase inhibitor. the disappearance of the slower migrating form of borealin upon phosphatase treatment suggests that the slower mobility is due to phosphorylation . the fact that adding phosphatase inhibitor blocked the ability of the phosphatase to convert the slower migrating band to the faster migrating band further confirms that the protein is phosphorylated, and that the conversion between forms is not due to contamination of the phosphatase with other enzymatic activities . these results demonstrate that borealin is phosphorylated in vivo during mitosis. in the experiment shown, a clone stably expressing a phosphomutant of borealin t106a was analyzed, however similar results were obtained with wild-type flag-borealin and endogenous borealin .

the majority of borealin is dephosphorylated in asynchronously growing cells, and phosphorylated during mitosis. to determine if borealin is dephosphorylated as cells exit mitosis we synchronized wt- <dig> cells in mitosis by exposure to nocodazole. borealin was analyzed by western blotting at various time points after release from the nocodazole block. cells were harvested up to  <dig> hours post release to determine the mobility shift of borealin and the level of cyclin b <dig> as a control for mitotic exit. at 1-hour post release, borealin is mostly in the slower migrating phosphorylated form . at 1-hour post release we consistently observe a ~30% increase in the total level of borealin protein compared to cells blocked with nocodazole . dephosphorylation of borealin is just visible at  <dig> hours and by  <dig> hours, cells show an abundant, faster migrating, dephosphorylated form of borealin. cyclin b <dig> levels decreased by  <dig> hours indicating that the cells have exited mitosis . thus, the dephosphorylation of borealin correlates with cyclin b <dig> degradation.

levels of ectopic borealin in mitosis
we observed a higher level of flag-borealin protein when cells were arrested in mitosis . in addition, the mutant of borealin in which s <dig> was changed to alanine also accumulated to higher levels when cells were blocked in mitosis compared to when they were growing asynchronously . the flag-borealin used is under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus  promoter. cmv has been reported to be active throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . to confirm this in our cells we transiently transfected them with green fluorescent protein  under the control of the cmv promoter. similar levels of gfp protein were observed in interphase and mitotic cells suggesting that the overexpression of borealin is not due to changes in transcription .

mitotic phosphorylation of borealin is not dependent on aurora b kinase
during mitosis, borealin co-localizes with aurora b, a mitotic kinase that can phosphorylate s <dig> of borealin in vitro  <cit> . phosphorylation of s <dig> is not required to generate the mitotic mobility shift of borealin. however, it was possible that aurora b phosphorylates a different site to induce the mobility shift. therefore, we tested the effect of zm <dig>  an effective inhibitor of aurora b kinase activity on the mitotic phosphorylation of borealin  <cit> . hela, a <dig> and hme cells treated with  <dig> Î¼m zm <dig> enter and exit mitosis but do not undergo cytokinesis  <cit> . we observed that many hela cells treated with zm <dig> contained multiple and abnormally shaped nuclei consistent with the inhibition of aurora b kinase in our treated cells . we currently do not have an explanation for the reduction in the percentage of cells at higher doses .

to determine the effect of aurora b kinase on the phosphorylation of borealin, we pretreated wt- <dig> cells with  <dig> Î¼m zm <dig> for  <dig> hour and then added nocodazole for  <dig> hours to block them in mitosis. zm <dig> was left in the medium during the nocodazole treatment to ensure that cells entered mitosis with low levels of aurora kinase activity. under these conditions, borealin migrated as a doublet similar to the cells blocked in mitosis with nocodazole without adding zm <dig> . also, pretreatment of wt- <dig> cells with a higher dose of zm <dig>  or ve <dig> , another aurora kinase inhibitor  <cit>  followed by nocodazole did not block the mitotic mobility shift of borealin . this suggests that aurora b is not required to generate the phosphorylated mitotic form of borealin.

localization of borealin in cells that fail to divide
similar to td- <dig> and incenp,  <cit> , we observed that borealin was able to migrate to the spindle midzone even when myosin was inhibited and cleavage was blocked with blebbistatin . interestingly, borealin was found to localize to a disorganized, tubulin-containing structure found in cells exposed to blebbistatin. this structure is likely the previously described "telophase disk", a remnant of the spindle midzone found in cytochalasin-treated cells  <cit> . these experiments indicate that the release of borealin from microtubules is correlated with the completion of cytokinesis; in cells that divide normally borealin is no longer associated with microtubules in g <dig>  <cit> . to test if blocking cytokinesis affects the phosphorylation of borealin, we synchronized cells in mitosis with nocodazole. cells were released from the block in the presence or absence of blebbistatin. in both cases, borealin was mostly dephosphorylated by  <dig> hours post release . these results indicate that borealin is dephosphorylated even when cytokinesis is blocked, and further suggests that dephosphorylation is not sufficient to release borealin from microtubules after mitotic exit.

phosphorylation of borealin during interphase
in an experiment aimed at finding the half-life of borealin protein, asynchronous wt- <dig> cells were treated with cyclohexamide  for different time points and the level of borealin was analyzed. interestingly, borealin showed a mobility shift and an abundant slower migrating form after cyclohexamide treatment for  <dig> hours . the short time needed for cyclohexamide to induce the phosphorylation of borealin suggested that the effect was not secondary to cell cycle synchronization induced by the drug. to confirm this, cells were blocked in s phase with hydroxyurea and then exposed to cyclohexamide for  <dig> or  <dig> hours. even when cell cycle progression was blocked, cyclohexamide induced the phosphorylation of borealin . to confirm that the mobility shift was due to phosphorylation, wt- <dig> cells blocked in s phase using hydroxyurea were exposed to cyclohexamide for  <dig> hours and the extracts were then treated in vitro with phosphatase for  <dig> and  <dig> hours and as a control with phosphatase and phosphatase inhibitor. the disappearance of the slower migrating form upon phosphatase treatment for  <dig> hours indicated that the shift was due to phosphorylation .

evidence that the phosphorylation of borealin is regulated by a labile serine/threonine phosphatase
the effects of cyclohexamide suggest that a kinase that phosphorylates borealin is present in s phase, and it is possible that it is the same kinase that phosphorylates borealin during mitosis. one explanation for the effects of cyclohexamide is that a labile phosphatase keeps borealin dephosphorylated during interphase. inactivation of the phosphatase during mitosis allows phosphorylated borealin to accumulate. to test this idea, asynchronously growing wt- <dig> cells, and those blocked in s phase using hydroxyurea were treated with different concentrations of naf, a broad-spectrum serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor for  <dig>  hours. cells treated with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm naf showed an increase in the phosphorylated form of flag-tagged and endogenous borealin . in contrast to naf, neither okadaic acid nor cyclosporine a had any effect on the migration of borealin suggesting that borealin is not dephosphorylated by pp <dig>  pp2a, pp <dig>  pp <dig>  or pp2b . our working hypothesis is that borealin is constantly phosphorylated during interphase, but is rapidly dephosphorylated by a labile phosphatase.

phosphorylated borealin interacts with incenp during mitosis
during mitosis, borealin associates with incenp-containing complexes <cit> . to determine which form of borealin binds to incenp, immunoprecipitations performed on asynchronous and mitotic wt- <dig> lysates using anti-incenp antibodies were analyzed by western blotting using an antibody to the flag-tagged borealin . anti-p <dig> antibody was used as a negative control for immunoprecipitation. in mitotic cells, incenp-containing complexes almost exclusively contained the phosphorylated form of borealin . this was not surprising since most of the borealin in mitotic cells is phosphorylated. however, even though the asynchronous 'input' lysate contained more of the faster migrating, dephosphorylated form of borealin, incenp immunoprecipitates appear to contain equal amounts of both forms of borealin . these results indicate that phosphorylation may enhance the interaction of borealin with the cpc.

discussion
the chromosomal passenger complex consisting of incenp, survivin, borealin and aurora b plays important roles in chromosome segregation at mitosis and cell division once mitosis is complete  <cit> . the complex shows a dynamic pattern of localization, being found at centromeres during metaphase and being deposited at the spindle midzone during anaphase after sister chromatid separation. there is evidence that targeting to the centromere is in part mediated by borealin which can bind to dna  <cit> . targeting to the microtubules at the spindle midzone may be mediated by incenp which has affinity for tubulin  <cit> . how the localization of the complex is regulated is not completely understood, although the kinesin mklp- <dig> is required for re-localization of incenp and aurora b from centromeres to the spindle midzone  <cit> . borealin mrna is cell cycle regulated with maximal expression during g <dig> and mitosis  <cit> . also, endogenous borealin protein levels are increased in cells blocked in mitosis using nocodazole  <cit> . we also observed that ectopic flag-tagged borealin driven by a constitute cmv promoter was more abundant in nocodazole-blocked cells . since similar levels of gfp protein are expressed under the control of the cmv promoter in asynchronous and mitotic cells, we predict that the level of borealin protein in mitosis is under post-transcriptional control. serine  <dig> can be phosphorylated in vitro by aurora b kinase  <cit> , and threonine  <dig> conforms to a single consensus cdk <dig> site  in borealin. mutation of either site did not disrupt the upregulation of ectopic borealin in mitosis , or alter the ability of the flag-tagged protein to localize to centromeres and the spindle midzone . interestingly, extensive electrophoresis allowed us to detect a phosphorylated form of borealin that is most abundant during mitosis. this slower migrating, phosphorylated form of borealin was evident for endogenous borealin and for exogenous, flag-tagged borealin in mitotic cells. in addition, this mitotic form of borealin was observed when serine  <dig> or threonine  <dig> were mutated to alanine , and also when aurora b kinase was inhibited by exposing cells to zm <dig> or ve <dig>  therefore, borealin is phosphorylated during mitosis in vivo by an unknown kinase, at a site or sites other than or in addition to s <dig> or t <dig>  it is possible that phosphorylation at t <dig> or s <dig> occurs in vivo but does not lead to a mobility shift and our results do not exclude this possibility.

we observed that borealin is dephosphorylated as cells exit mitosis. interestingly, treating asynchronous or s phase cells with cyclohexamide induced a mobility shift of borealin as a result of phosphorylation. our model to explain the effects of cyclohexamide is that the borealin kinase is active throughout the cell cycle, but is counteracted by a labile phosphatase that is active during interphase. inactivation of the phosphatase during mitosis would allow accumulation of the mitotic form of borealin. consistent with this hypothesis, we observed an increase in the slower migrating, phosphorylated form of borealin when asynchronous or s phase cells were exposed to naf, a broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor. the shifted form of borealin induced by cyclohexamide or naf shows a similar mobility as the form that accumulates during mitosis. our working hypothesis is that the same phosphorylation events are responsible for these shifted forms. the fact that neither okadaic acid nor cyclosporine a induced the phosphorylation of borealin during interphase indicates that dephosphorylation is not accomplished by the phosphatases pp <dig>  pp2a, pp2b, pp <dig> or pp <dig>  there are other more complicated models to explain the effects of cyclohexamide and naf on borealin phosphorylation and further study will be required to understand the molecular basis of its cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation.

the mechanisms that control the function of borealin and the chromosomal passenger complex are not completely understood. for example, as found for incenp and aurora b  <cit>  we found that the movement of borealin from centromeres to the spindle midzone was independent of a functional actomyosin ring. borealin was found at the telophase disk, a remnant of the spindle midzone that persists hours after cleavage has been aborted  <cit> . in some cells we could observe decondensed chromatin indicating that the binucleated daughter nuclei had entered g <dig>  with borealin still attached to the remnants of the spindle midzone . the mechanism responsible for this persistent accumulation is not clear. the release of borealin from the spindle midzone may require additional mechanisms apart from dephosphorylation of borealin. one possibility is that cell division provides a trigger to remove borealin  from the midzone microtubules.

to begin to analyze the functional significance of borealin phosphorylation, we studied its interaction with another cpc protein, incenp. abundant, phosphorylated borealin was detected in incenp immunoprecipitates from mitotic cells showing that incenp interacts with phosphorylated borealin, the form that predominates during mitosis. analysis of incenp immunoprecipitates from asynchronous cells was more informative. although borealin was mostly in the dephosphorylated form in the total lysate, incenp immunoprecipitated equal amounts of both migrating forms of borealin. this shows that the interphase, fast migrating form of borealin can form a complex with incenp, however, preference is given to the phosphorylated form. one interpretation is that the phosphorylation of borealin during mitosis stabilizes its association with the cpc. this may occur by stabilizing its interaction with survivin, incenp, itself, dna or via a combination of those interactions. further analysis of the modification of borealin should help to illuminate how the cpc is assembled.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that a phosphorylated form of borealin exists in mitotic cells. generation of this mitotic phosphorylated form of borealin does not require aurora b kinase activity or the residues s <dig> or t <dig> of borealin. both the interphase form and the mitotic form of borealin can form a complex with incenp, however there is a preference for the mitotic form. a phosphorylated form of borealin can also be induced in interphase cells by treatment with either cyclohexamide or naf. borealin travels to the spindle midzone when actin/myosin-mediated contraction of the cleavage furrow is inhibited, and remains attached to the remnants of the spindle in cells that fail to divide. borealin is dephosphorylated when cells exit mitosis whether or not they are able to form a functional cleavage furrow.
