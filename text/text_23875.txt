BACKGROUND
in temperate zones, woody plants go through seasonal cycles with two stages: a growing period when environmental conditions are favorable and a period of non growth in winter . this second period of non growth is known as dormancy, and is defined as the time between bud set in the fall and bud burst in the spring. dormancy allows trees to survive unfavorable conditions in winter  <cit>  and can be divided into two phases of variable duration and intensity  <cit> : endodormancy and ecodormancy.

i.) firstly endodormancy: the deepest state of dormancy, in which bud burst is prevented by endogenous factors specific to the meristem. the strength of endodormancy increases from the end of summer, throughout the fall, generally peaking somewhere between the end of october and the end of november in the northern hemisphere depending on the species and the climatic conditions prevailing during the fall  <cit> . a dormancy breaking test, or forcing test, is the method of choice for assessing the depth of endodormancy in trees  <cit> . the signals leading to the breaking of endodormancy in perennials are well characterized, temperature playing a major role in both the induction and release of endodormancy  <cit> .

ii.) secondly ecodormancy: this dormancy state occurs when unfavorable external environmental factors  prevent bud burst in late winter and early spring.

the growing season of trees extends from bud burst in the spring to bud set in the fall. this phenological cycle has been shown to be strongly affected by climatic change, higher temperatures having a negative impact on endodormancy  and a positive impact on ecodormancy   <cit> . on the other hand, kalcsits et al.  <cit>  reported that high temperatures during endodormancy induction in poplar leads to deeper endodormancy and delayed bud burst in the spring  <cit> .

an overall increase in the duration of the growing season has been reported in temperate regions, for both fruit and forest trees . in this context, early bud break is a particularly crucial issue in terms not only of the increase in length of the growing season, but also the risk of frost damage  <cit> .

several quantitative genetic approaches have been used to study the genetic basis of bud phenology in forest trees, focusing essentially on the date of bud burst. medium to high heritability values have been reported, from  <dig>  in salix <cit>  to  <dig>  in populus <cit> . saintagne et al.  <cit>  reported repeatability values of  <dig>  to  <dig>  in pedunculate oak , indicating moderate to medium genetic control for this trait, whereas very high heritability values were reported in progeny tests and parent-offspring comparisons for quercus petraea. derory et al.  <cit>  reported the identification of  <dig> qtls for bud burst for 13 year × site seasonal observations in a cloned full-sib oak pedigree, suggesting polygenic control of this adaptive trait.

however, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of bud dormancy in forest trees remains poorly understood. most investigations of gene expression have been carried out in model plants, such as arabidopsis thaliana, for which functional candidate genes have been identified  <cit> . these studies highlight the role of phytochromes as central players in day-length sensing. allona et al.  <cit>  reported that dormancy induction in forest trees was driven by molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in the photoperiodic control of flowering time in annuals  <cit> . however, the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of dormancy, once it has been established, are also poorly understood. several molecular studies in perennials, such as kiwi  <cit> , grape  <cit> , potato  <cit> , raspberry  <cit>  and leafy spurge  <cit> , have shown that dormancy signals affect multiple physiological processes, including cell division, secondary metabolism , hormone signalling  and oxidative stress. these studies also reported changes in the accumulation of transcripts from many regulatory genes thought to be involved in dormancy transition or regulating specific metabolic pathways involved in dormancy transition. in forest trees, the use of transcriptomic approaches to detect the expression of candidate genes thought to be involved in vegetative bud dormancy remains limited. derory et al.  <cit>  and rohde et al.  <cit>  used targeted approaches  to identify genes displaying differential patterns of expression at different stages of dormancy . ruttink et al.  <cit>  used high-density microarrays to reveal the existence of gene networks involved in apical bud formation and dormancy induction in poplar. transgenic studies have also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying bud phenology. in comparisons with the peach ever-growing  mutant, for example, jimérez et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes that were upregulated in the wild type, and therefore potentially involved in photoperiod response, growth cessation and the induction of dormancy. in poplar, ibañez et al.  <cit>  reported a potential role of circadian clock-related genes in cold hardiness and delayed bud burst.

in this context, the objective of this study was to characterize the transcriptome of endo- and ecodormant sessile oak  by whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing  and to identify genes displaying differential expression between the two phenological stages, with the aim of improving our understanding of dormancy at the molecular level. firstly, four cdna libraries were built from total rna extracted from apical buds harvested during endo- or ecodormancy, from two populations with different bud burst dates . the transcriptome was then characterized by pyrosequencing on a roche  <dig> flx platform. in total,  <dig>  reads were produced. reads were mapped onto the oak unigene sequences generated from  <dig> cdna libraries  <cit> . digital expression analysis and quantitative pcr identified a set of genes displaying differential regulation between these two developmental phases and possibly inter connected with a gene network. none of these genes was associated with a specific population.

RESULTS
identification of the endodormancy and ecodormancy developmental phases
the three main developmental phases typically involved in dormancy in perennial plants  were identified in the two oak populations . the endodormancy phase extended roughly from july 30th  <dig> to october 29th  <dig>  in both populations. endodormancy levels peaked on the same date in both populations . a transition phase occurred from october 29th to november 26th. finally, the ecodormancy phase began on december 4th.

dormant bud transcriptome
a total of  <dig>  reads were obtained from the four libraries . the cleaning process lead us to eliminate  <dig>   reads, resulting in  <dig>   reads which were then assembled into oakcontigv <dig>  <cit> . reads from the two endodormancy libraries were distributed into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons, whereas those from the two ecodormancy libraries were distributed into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . differential expression was analyzed for  <dig>  contigs with corrected read numbers ≥  <dig> .

* the values are not a simple sum of those for endo- and ecodormancy, because there were common contigs to which reads from both libraries were mapped.

detection and analysis of differentially expressed genes
an analysis of differential expression with r statistics  <cit>  resulted in  <dig>  contigs , suggesting significant differences in expression between the four libraries. the number of contigs for a given value of the r statistic was plotted as a function of r . no genes displaying significant differential expression between populations were identified, allowing us to treat these two populations as biological replicates. edger  <cit>  and deseq  <cit>  r bioconductor packages detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, respectively, displaying significant differential expression between endodormancy and ecodormancy . these values were higher than those using a 5% fdr  and  <dig>  contigs identified as significantly differentially expressed by edger and deseq, respectively). the differences in relative expression between the endo- and ecodormancy libraries and relative read numbers for each contig are displayed as ma plots  in figure  <dig>  a venn diagram displaying the number of differentially expressed genes identified by each of the three programs  is shown in figure  <dig>  where  <dig> contigs were identified by all three programs , and  <dig> contigs  were detected in total. for  <dig> contigs, only r statistics were consistent with differential expression, whereas only  <dig> contigs were identified as differentially expressed by edger and only nine were identified as differentially expressed by deseq package alone. heat maps were drawn for both the mx and mn sets .

at least one blast hit against swiss-prot was found for  <dig>  contigs and at least one blast hit against tair <dig> was found for  <dig>  contigs . in total,  <dig> go terms were assigned to  <dig>  contigs. these go terms were mapped against  <dig> go-slim terms.

enrichment analysis for aracyc pathways and gene ontology groups  was then performed both for the gene up-regulated during endo-  and ecodormancy  identified by the three programs.

among ecodormancy regulated genes eapg enabled us to identify three pathways from aracyc and  <dig> groups from the go commons . looking to the aracyc pathway, eapg found three pathways enriched: stachyose biosynthesis, oxidative ethanol degradation and beta alanine biosynthesis. eapg identified also  <dig> go groups enriched for ecodormancy up-regulated genes. the first five groups were linked to response to cold, high light intensity, water deprivation, abscisic acid stimulus and water channel activity.

sub-network enrichment analysis  was performed and identified central hubs and their associated partners. among ecodormancy up-regulated genes three gene-linked hubs , three processes- linked hubs  and two molecule-linked hubs  were identified .

the same analysis was also performed for endodormancy up-regulated genes. eapg identified one aracyc enriched pathway  and  <dig> enriched go groups . the first five group based on their p-value were associated with metal ion binding, cellular transition metal ion homeostasis, fatty acid binding, 2-iron2-sulfur cluster binding and epidermis morphogenesis. no central hubs were identified through the fnse analysis.

tissue specificity of differentially expressed genes
significant differential expression of genes in the mn set was detected for  <dig> genes  in an in silico expression analysis of cdna libraries for quercus . the number of reads mapping onto three genes was positive for bud tissue, but zero for other tissue types . two of these unigene elements  were identified as up-regulated during endodormancy and ecodormancy, respectively, displayed no similarity to any other protein, whereas the third one , was found to be similar to the glutathione s-transferase tau  <dig> 

validation of candidate genes displaying differential expression, by quantitative pcr
among the five control genes analysed , only one  displayed a multi-banding pattern after pcr amplification. two other genes  displayed changes in expression over the time course of the experiment, in both populations, and were therefore discarded from the analysis. the two remaining genes  were found to display stable expression in both populations, during both dormancy periods, and were therefore used to normalize qpcr data .

among the  <dig> candidate gene analysed, only one encoding a cold-shock protein, was validated in a single population , the  <dig> remaining genes displayed expression profiles similar to those observed in the  <dig> sequencing experiment in both populations. nine of the validated genes were overexpressed during ecodormancy , glutathione-s-transferase , dormancy-associated protein , dehydrin xero <dig> , plasma membrane-intrinsic protein , awpm-19-like membrane family protein , gibberellin receptor gid1l <dig> , late embryogenesis abundant protein lea <dig>  and early light-induced protein ). the two remaining genes  were upregulated during the endodormancy period. the expression profiles of the genes analyzed by qpcr are provided in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  for reference and candidate genes, pcr efficiency ranged from 87%  to 104% , which fits with the correct functioning of taq polymerase.

discussion
given the extremely high rate of validation of the in silico analysis by qpcr, we will consider for the scope of the discussion the core set of  <dig> contigs  showing differential expression with three different algorithms . no annotation was available for  <dig> of these  <dig> contigs . a molecular function was attributed to the  <dig> remaining contigs .

gene ontology analysis showed that this set of genes was enriched in genes responsible for abiotic  and endogenous stimuli  and stress-related genes. similar trends were observed in analyses of gene expression in other plants. in raspberry, the set of genes displaying differential expression during endodormancy and paradormancy included a high proportion of stress-response/defense/detoxification-related genes  <cit> . in grape, genes relating to oxidative processes and stress responses within the cell are expressed at the end of dormancy  <cit> .

genes upregulated during endodormancy
plants are sessile and must therefore be able to prepare themselves to survive unfavorable conditions. in temperate regions, deciduous trees stop growing, lose their leaves in the fall and enter a state of dormancy to allow them to survive the winter. the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying dormancy induction remain unclear, although an analogy with the mechanisms of vernalization and flowering has been suggested  <cit> . however, some common features of dormancy in buds, seeds and tubers may help to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms, although some features are specific  <cit> .

our transcriptomics analysis revealed that  <dig> genes in the core  set were overexpressed during endodormancy. among these genes, two were quantified and validated by qpcr. the first gene encodes a basic 7s globulin  <dig> gene . globulin is a well known storage protein present in many plant seeds  <cit> . it accumulates during seed maturation and desiccation before dormancy and is consumed during germination. in maize seeds  <cit> , globulin accumulation is triggered by a plant hormone, abscisic acid , before dormancy. the upregulation of globulin in oak endodormant buds may also be triggered by aba produced in response to the environmental conditions prevailing in the fall. short-day conditions or low temperature may initiate aba biosynthesis, thereby inducing endodormancy and resulting in a cessation of growth, bud set and cold hardening. the accumulation of globulin transcripts in endodormant buds in oak may be considered as a response to an abiotic stimulus. globulin may be used to provide the nutrients required for bud burst, just as seed storage proteins are used for germination  <cit> .

the second gene encodes a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase  <dig>   belonging to the several ontologies  over-expression of xth was also reported by anderson et al.  <cit>  in endo-dormant crown bud of leafy spurge  <cit> . xth genes constitute a multigene family encoding proteins involved in cell wall construction and disassembly, with diverse levels of expression in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . in tomato, two isozymes of xth  with opposite patterns of expression have been detected  <cit> . lexet was abundant in the rapid elongation region, whereas lexet <dig> was more abundant in the mature/non elongating region. enzymatic analysis of xyloglucan endotransglycosylase activity in arabidopsis showed cold tolerance, with optimal activity for this enzyme at temperatures of 12°c to 18°c, consistent with a potential role in cold acclimation or cold-tolerant growth  <cit> . the xth gene is also strongly expressed in the dormant cambium of populus tremula, suggesting a role for xth in cell wall modification during dormancy acquisition  <cit> . samples of prunus percica buds released from dormancy are rich in xth mrna  <cit> , probably due to the remodeling of cell wall structure for resumption of the growth cycle. the abundant expression of the xth gene observed in the oak endodormancy library also suggests a potential role in cold acclimation, through the modification of cell wall structure.

the contigs of known function of the core set upregulated during endodormancy included mlp <dig> , pheophorbide a oxygenase  and agglutinin. mlp <dig> have been reported to be involved in drought regulation in populus <cit> , though down-regulated in drought treatment. pao is an enzyme necessary to break down chlorophyll  <cit> , while agglutinin functions as glycan binding in castanea crenata <cit> .

genes upregulated during ecodormancy
ecodormancy is a short-term phenomenon induced by a prolonged period of cold and long-day conditions, which provide an initial signal triggering a shift from endodormancy  <cit> . in this section we discuss the genes up-regulated during ecodormancy according to the pathway highlighted through the eapg and fnse analysis as well as our qpcr analysis . indeed several pathways known to be regulated during ecodormancy  were differentially regulated in our dataset . it should also be borne in mind that because of the low number of contigs, as well as the rather relaxed threshold used to declare a significant differential expressions, the analysis of pathways and networks requires further validation.

response to abscisic acid
abscisic acid  is an important hormone involved in seed dormancy and germination. recent studies  <cit>  reported that the interaction between aba and gibberellin was associated with loss of apical dominance. several genes belonging to this functional category were illuminated through the eapg  and the fnse . among these differentially expressed genes, an early light inducible protein  was identified. elip protein is a nuclear-encoded chlorophyll a/b binding protein of the thylakoid membranes that is upregulated by illumination  <cit> . the primary function of this protein is thought to be the prevention of photoinhibition in high light conditions, through the dispersal of absorbed light  <cit> , but elip also accumulates in response to various stresses, such as cold  <cit>  and uv-b irradiation, in green leaves  <cit> . in blueberry floral buds, elip mrna levels are high until the end of february , with maximal levels of expression in december  and no expression in october  in the absence of cold acclimation  <cit> . the endodormancy library was based on samples from september 17th, 24th and october 1st. we therefore speculate that the higher levels of elip expression recorded for ecodormancy libraries  than for endodormancy libraries  are consistent with the buds in our endodormancy sample not being cold-acclimated and that elip was not induced in the lc <dig> and sj <dig> libraries despite the buds being in a state of endodormancy. derory et al. <cit>  showed that elip was more strongly expressed in q. petraea buds in the vegetative growth phase than during ecodormancy, in macroarray experiments  <cit> . elip is induced not only by cold, but also by high light intensity. the primary stresses responsible for the upregulation of elip in this study and in the study by derory et al.  <cit>  may therefore be different.

a low temperature inducible protein lti <dig>  highly expressed during ecodormancy was also identified. this gene is also regulated by aba  <cit> . the lti <dig> gene is expressed in arabidopsis thaliana leaves after cold stress  <cit> . dehydrins  are stress-responsive proteins induced by dehydration in conditions of drought, low temperature, salinity and seed maturation  <cit> . dehydrin is upregulated after cold acclimation in blueberry floral buds  <cit> . in norway spruce, most dehydrin genes are expressed in ecodormant buds and downregulated towards bud burst  <cit> . a dehydrin-like protein has also been detected in swelling oak buds  <cit> .

two plasma membrane intrinsic proteins  were identified in our transcriptomic approach. these proteins have been shown to be regulated both by aba and water stress  <cit> . pip constitutes a subfamily of aquaporins, membrane proteins that form channels in the membrane, facilitating the movement of water across membranes. the pip gene is also upregulated during vernalization in grape buds  <cit> . in raspberry, it has also been shown that aquaporin genes were regulated between the different phase of the dormancy  <cit> .

among ecodormancy up-regulated genes, we identified a heat shock protein . hsp <dig>   was one of the most expressed genes. hsp  <dig>  is also regulated by aba  <cit> . hsp have chaperone activity by maintaining protein in their functional conformation and therefore prevent the degradation of proteins damaged during cold stress.

finally an atdi <dig> protein similar to late embryogenesis abundant protein  <dig>  was found to be over-expressed during ecodormancy. lea <dig> belongs to a family of lea originally discovered in cotton seeds during late embryogenesis  <cit> . lea proteins stabilize cellular components in cells subjected to water deficit, probably because of their hydrophilic properties  <cit> . lea may also protect the cells during environmental stresses by lowering water potential, stabilizing membrane structure and scavenging active oxygen species. in q. petraea buds  <cit> , lea <dig> mrnas were detected during ecodormancy, and this upregulation during ecodormancy was confirmed by qpcr  <cit> . similarly, in this study, lea <dig> transcripts were shown, by qpcr, to be upregulated in ecodormant buds . by contrast, an expression analysis on raspberry buds  <cit> , revealed that both dehydrin-like and lea proteins were produced in larger amounts during endodormancy. moreover, poplar apical buds also express lea14-a principally during the endodormancy induction phase  <cit> . in leafy spurge, horvath et al.  <cit>  reported also that dehydration genes were down-regulated following the transition from endo- to ecodormancy  <cit> . these discrepancies may reflect the diverse functions and expression patterns of lea proteins in different tissues and during diverse developmental stages  <cit> .

response to cold
in temperate region, perennial species are able to increase their freezing tolerance in response to low temperature observed during ecodormancy. this process is called cold acclimation and the coordinated expression of thousand genes to induce physiological and biochemical changes in the buds  is required. several cold inducible genes have been isolated from plants and although some are regulated by low temperature, most of them are known to response both to aba and water deprivation suggesting a strong interaction between these pathways during ecodormancy. our functional analyses  revealed several genes involved in the response to cold . first we identified a rci2b gene highly similar to a rare cold inducible protein 2b. this gene belongs to a small multigene family regulated by low temperature and aba. it was suggested that this genes is involved in the maintenance of membrane integrity triggered by low temperature that reduces water availability. rci2b genes may interact with other membrane proteins to maintain the water status of the cell .

an erd <dig> gene highly similar to a dehydrin protein was also identified. dehydrin proteins are a group of proteins with a protective role against stresses. these proteins are synthesized in response to low temperature and aba. a positive correlation between dehydrin content  and freezing tolerance has been reported in fragaria . we could hypothesize that the up-regulation of this genes during ecodormancy is associated with a protective role against low temperature observed in late winter.

finally, a dreb1a genes over-expressed during ecodormancy was identified. several studies reported that dreb transcription factors are essential for dormancy regulation in plants  <cit> . dreb1a transcription factor contains an ap2/ereb motif and have a binding function to the promoter containing the crt/dre  which exists in many lea genes including erd genes. over-expression of dreb1a transcription factors induces in normal condition the over-expression of these cold-stress related genes and confers an improved tolerance to both water stress and low temperature  <cit> . over-expression of dreb1a transcription factor during ecodormancy may be interpreted in light to the over-expression observed for lea <dig> and erd <dig> genes allowing the bud to face low temperature observed during ecodormancy.

response to gibberellin stimulus
gibberellins  are plant hormones that regulate growth and influence various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination and dormancy. two genes belong directly to this functional category , and one gene indirectly involved was also identified and validated by qpcr . erd  <dig> encodes an early response to dehydration protein . briefly, erd proteins belong to a multigene family known to be strongly regulated during dormancy in leafy spurge  <cit> . this protein accumulates during dehydration and is probably involved in the protection of the membrane.

gasa   <cit>  was originally identified in a gibberellin-deficit mutant of tomato, as a ga-regulated gene  <cit> . this gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner  <cit>  and is involved in several developmental processes, such as seed germination, stem elongation and flowering. ga regulates growth after the release of dormancy. in potato tubers, endogenous ga content increases when sprouts begin to grow  <cit>  and ga biosynthesis is controlled by the photoperiod  <cit> .

finally we identified a gid <dig> encoding gene  overexpressed during ecodormancy. gid <dig> is a soluble protein that interacts directly with ga, triggering the gibberellin response  <cit> . gibberellic acids are key hormone involved in dormancy, several authors reported that they could replace chilling of dormant buds . in a microarray analysis of grape buds, gid <dig> was found to be upregulated during vernalization  <cit> . on the other hand, a down regulation of the gib1b gene was observed in endodormant buds of leafy spurge  <cit> . these authors hypothesized that down regulation of the gib1b gene in conjunction with drebs  played a significant role in endodormancy release or ecodormancy maintenance.

response to oxidative stress
three genes  belonged to this go term. gstu <dig> is similar to a glutathione-s- transferase . gsts are found in several animal and plant cytosols, and have diverse functions in detoxification, oxidative stress resistance and light signaling  <cit> . in some woody plants, gst is upregulated during the release of endodormancy, probably due to the response to oxidative stress  <cit>  induced by low temperature  <cit> .

other genes identified
the dyl <dig>  was up-regulated during ecodormancy. dyl <dig> is abundantly expressed in axillary buds of pea, with mrna levels decreasing after decapitation; it is therefore considered a good marker of dormancy  <cit> . in blueberry buds, drm mrna levels were highest in a sample collected on december 8th, subsequently decreasing towards bud burst  <cit> . in grape buds, drm gene expression also decreases progressively towards bud burst, this gene being more strongly expressed during dormancy  <cit> .

finally, in this study, the expression profile of the awpm  gene was also analyzed by qpcr. awpm, a membrane protein that confers cold tolerance, has a sequence similar to that of lea and is induced by aba  <cit> . quantitative pcr showed also upregulation of the cold-shock protein only in the lc <dig> library . this protein has been also detected in plants subjected to cold stress for acclimation  <cit> . the protein binds to nucleic acids and destabilizes rna structure, thereby affecting protein translation. these results strengthen once again that aba and cold acclimation are probably the most important pathways involved in ecodormancy regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the timing of bud burst affects the fitness of individual trees. bud dormancy changes in nature from the fall to the spring. we investigated the molecular basis of dormancy, by analyzing differences in gene expression between two dormancy phases  in sessile oak  liebl.) buds by rna-seq. we identified  <dig> unigene elements displaying differential expression  between the endo- and ecodormancy phases, with a false discovery rate of 20%. thirty four contigs were over–expressed during endodormancy and  <dig> were up-regulated during ecodormancy. enrichement anlysis revealed that the molecular mechanisms involved in dormancy regulation were different between the  <dig> conditions. indeed, enriched go groups for response to cold, high light intensity and aba stimulus were found only during ecodormancy while other go groups - metal ion binding, fatty acid binding and epidermis morphogenesis - were specific for endodormancy.

in conclusion, these results demonstrate that rna-seq technology and the associated statistical methods are suitable for the detection of differentially expressed genes. we identified promising expressional candidate genes for future forward genetics studies. they will serve as a stepping stone to further work on dormancy, particularly as concerns woody plants, for which few data are currently available.
