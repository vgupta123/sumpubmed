BACKGROUND
dihydropteroate synthase  catalyses the reaction of 6-hydroxymethyl- <dig> -dihydropterin-pyrophosphate with p-aminobenzoic acid  to yield  <dig> -dihydropteroate and pyrophosphate . in so doing the enzyme supports the biosynthesis of folate, a key metabolite required to support the synthesis of dna, and proteins. the provision of folates, either by synthesis in plants and microorganisms or as acquired in the diet by mammals, supports life. the folate biosynthetic pathway is absent from humans and contains several highly valued drug targets for treatments of numerous infections  <cit> . the folate pathway consists of a number of enzymes in addition to dhps, including: 6-hydroxymethyl- <dig> -dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase , dihydrofolate synthetase  and dihydrofolate reductase . drugs that inhibit dhfr and dhps are used in the treatment of infections by the apicomplexan parasites plasmodium sp. and toxoplasma gondii  <cit> . in these species dhps is part of a bifunctional enzyme fused to hppk  <cit> .

the gram-negative aerobic bacterium burkholderia cenocepacia is an opportunistic pathogen and a member of the burkholderia complex, a closely related group of bacteria, which cause particular problems for cystic fibrosis patients  <cit> . other members of the genus are also pathogenic; b. pseudomallei is the causal agent for melioidosis  <cit> , a serious infection found primarily in south east asia, and b. mallei is responsible for glanders, an infection of livestock  <cit> . a characteristic of burkholderia species, and one that makes them particularly troublesome pathogens is that they are highly resistant to a wide range of antibiotics  <cit> .

dhps is a validated drug target for the treatment of diseases caused by bacteria and protozoan parasites  <cit> . sulfonamides in particular are inhibitors of this enzyme and are used as antibiotics  <cit> . however, increasing levels of resistance to sulfonamides has been observed and there is a need for new drugs to compensate for this  <cit> . the value of accurate structural information to support early stage drug discovery is well recognized  <cit>  and characterization of the active site of dhps from pathogenic organisms has the potential to support the design of new treatments.

structures of dhps from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have been reported  <cit>  and also the bifunctional hppk-dhps from saccharomyces cerevisiae and francisella tularensis  <cit> . the structural studies extend to characterization of the oxidized product analogue, pteroic acid, and a series of pterin derivatives in complex with bacillus anthracis dhps   <cit>  and also a series of pterin derivatives, and a complex of escherichia coli dhps  with sulfanilamide  <cit> . one structure, that of thermus thermophilus dhps complexed with p-aba has also been solved . one observation, reported in several studies  and made by our inspection of pdb entries is the pronounced conformational flexibility of loops around the active site. this has resulted in the omission of important residues from the structural models.

here we report the expression, purification and crystallization of bcdhps. we describe the crystal structures of the apo-enzyme, the first complex with the actual enzyme product  <dig> -dihydropteroate, which produces a more complete view of the active site than most other structures, similarities and differences between dhps structures, and discuss molecular features that might be exploited to derive novel inhibitors.

RESULTS
general comments
an efficient recombinant source of bcdhps was prepared and a purification protocol established that resulted in approximately  <dig> mg of pure enzyme from one litre of bacterial culture. the purified protein was used in co-crystallization screens with the inhibitor sulphadoxine or the enzyme product  <dig> -dihydropteroate. distinct orthorhombic crystal forms were obtained. however, analysis of the crystals grown in the presence of sulphadoxine revealed only water molecules in the active site and this therefore represents the apo-bcdhps structure determined to  <dig>  Å resolution. the structure of bcdhps complexed with  <dig> -dihydropteroate was refined to  <dig>  Å resolution. initial phases for the product complex were obtained by molecular replacement calculations using the ecdhps structure , which has 44% amino acid sequence identity to bcdhps, as the search model. the model for molecular replacement calculations to solve the apo-structure of bcdhps was the product complex. bcdhps comprises  <dig> amino acids. the apo-enzyme crystallized in space group c <dig> with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. a number of residues could not be modeled in the electron density maps and so were omitted hence the model for this structure consists of  <dig> residues. the crystals for the complex structure display space group p <dig> and there are two molecules, labeled a and b, in the asymmetric unit. here also disorder was evident and several residues in each subunit are missing from the model. subunit a consists of  <dig> residues and subunit b consists of  <dig>  these subunits are similar in structure and superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å . the two structures superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å . such a close agreement suggests that there are no gross structural changes upon ligand binding but as will be explained, ligand binding promotes greater order in loops that contribute to the active site.

the overall structure and comparison with orthologues
bcdhps displays a triosephosphate isomerase -barrel fold, consisting of eight parallel β-strands surrounded by eight α-helices . at the n-terminus there is an antiparallel alignment of two short β-strands, termed nβ <dig> and nβ <dig>  linked by a tight turn. this is a feature common to some other dhps structures. we assign β <dig> as the first strand of the β8:α <dig> barrel. residues 234- <dig> form a short α-helix inserted between β <dig> and α <dig> and is considered part of loop  <dig>  size-exclusion gel filtration indicates that bcdhps is a dimer, of approximate mass  <dig> kda, in solution . the apo-enzyme structure has a single polypeptide chain in the asymmetric unit whilst the product complex has two. in the latter structure, chains a and b form a dimer stabilized by an interface with a surface area  that is approximately 10% of that of a single subunit . residues on α <dig> of one subunit interact with residues on α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> of the partner subunit. nearly  <dig> amino acids from each subunit participate in around  <dig> direct hydrogen bonds and salt bridge interactions, plus numerous water mediated contacts between the subunits and the same dimer is formed in the apo-structure by the symmetry operation -x, y, -z + ½.

the alignment of the central β-strands results in the localization of the n-terminal segments of these strands at one end of the barrel and the c-terminal segments at the other. on the n-terminal side there are polypeptide segments that form loops connecting the α-helix to the β-strand that follows. these loops are relatively short and well defined in the electron density maps . on the c-terminal side of the tim-barrel, where the active site is located, there are longer, more flexible loops, called the c-terminal loops, that link a β-strand with the following α-helix. the shorter n-terminal loops of tim-barrel structures are suggested to contribute stability of the protein fold whereas the c-terminal loops contribute to enzyme activity by creation of the active site  <cit> . the first c-terminal loop, linking β <dig> to α <dig> could not be modeled in either structure, due to poorly defined density, suggesting a significant degree of conformational flexibility. modeling of loop  <dig>  linking β <dig> to α <dig> was possible only in the case of the product complex. the increased order observed for the complex is consistent with the stabilizing effects of ligand binding, as loop  <dig> contributes to the active site, a feature that will be discussed later.

the overall sequence identity of bcdhps with the enzyme from other gram-negative species is in the region of 40-60% and the fold of bcdhps and dimeric quaternary structure is consistent with that observed for dhps from other species. structural overlays of the bcdhps subunit with orthologous structures identified greatest similarity to e. coli dhps with r.m.s.d. values of  <dig> - <dig>  Å . r.m.s.d. values of  <dig>  Å  and  <dig>  aligned cα atoms) were observed for dhps structures from streptococcus pneumoniae  and  <dig>  Å  for the mycobacterium tuberculosis dhps structure . the orientation of dhps subunits with respect to each other varies  <cit>  but there is no evidence to suggest that this has an influence on activity. the dhps active site is formed entirely within a single subunit. the difference in subunit orientation may simply reflect sequence variation between species. the residues that occur at the dimer interface  show only a low level of sequence conservation .

the flexible c-terminal loops are the regions where the most structural variation between dhps models has been observed. of particular note are loops  <dig> and  <dig>  the amino acid residues that comprise these loops are highly conserved in dhps orthologues  but they are absent from the majority of published crystallographic models. where the electron density maps have allowed for their inclusion it is noted that the polypeptides display different conformations. this points to a high propensity to disorder due to flexibility and an important role in enzyme function. one role for these loops has been proposed, namely that they close over and shield the active site from bulk solvent during catalysis  <cit> . to this we would add a potentially important thermodynamic contribution to the enzyme function. changes in conformational entropy associated with distinct configurations of the loop structures might contribute to the free energy of protein-ligand association  <cit> . we note the presence of conserved glycine residues at the c-terminal end of β <dig> and on loop  <dig> itself  that may contribute to the flexibility in this part of the structure. loop  <dig> is closer than loop  <dig> to the enzyme active site and adjacent to loop  <dig> . the residues that constitute loop  <dig> are less well conserved . bcdhps has  <dig> residues in this loop, a similar number,  <dig>  are present in the e. coli enzyme, whilst staphylococcus aureus dhps has only  <dig> residues in the loop . this lack of conservation in loop  <dig> and interactions with the conformationally labile loop  <dig> likely contributes to the variation observed when different dhps structures are compared .

as an aside we mention the following observation made by a reviewer. at the c-terminal end of β <dig>  leading into loop  <dig> the amino acid sequence in bcdhps asn28-ala29-thr <dig>  in ecdhps and sadhps the sequence is asn-val-thr. this is a well-recognized n-glycosylation signal, asn-x-ser/thr  <cit> . however, in each case dhps is a cytosolic bacterial enzyme from organisms lacking in glycosides.

binding of  <dig> -dihydropteroate
the active site of dhps is positioned at the c-terminal end of the central β-barrel. here, the product of the enzyme reaction,  <dig> -dihydropteroate is ordered , placed with the pterin directed down into the barrel with the p-aba moiety pointing out towards the surface of the protein . residues located on strands β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> participate in interactions with the product. the interactions formed between the enzyme and the ligand are very similar in both subunits and therefore only details of subunit a are presented  unless stated otherwise.

the ligand possesses nine functional groups of which eight participate in direct hydrogen bonds with dhps. four hydrogen bond donors, n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> interact with functional groups on asn <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig> and thr <dig> respectively. the n <dig> atom of the ligand accepts a hydrogen bond donated by asn <dig> nd <dig>  on the other side of the pterin, o <dig> and n <dig> accept hydrogen bonds donated from lys <dig> nz. this lysine side chain is also held in place by a hydrogen bond donated to the carbonyl oxygen of gly <dig>  an ordered water molecule interacts with o <dig> and asp <dig> od <dig>  a carboxylate oxygen, on the p-aba moiety, accepts hydrogen bonds donated from the main chain amide and side chain hydroxyl groups of ser <dig>  in subunit a the other oxygen interacts with two water molecules that in turn interact with the carbonyl and amide groups of gly <dig> and met <dig> respectively . in subunit b only the latter interaction is observed. the proximity of c <dig> to the carbonyl oxygen and og <dig> hydroxyl of thr <dig>  distances range from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å in subunits a and b, indicates the potential for c-h•••o hydrogen bonds. these are weak but not insignificant stabilizing interactions  <cit> . the e. coli dhps structure  with  <dig> -dihydropterin pyrophosphate bound in the active site, shows thr <dig>  interacting with the phosphate groups of the ligand  <cit> . in our bcdhps structure thr <dig>  part of loop  <dig>  interacts with asp <dig> and the dihydropterin. this suggests that the conformation of loop  <dig> alters depending on which ligand is bound in the active site.

the pterin is sandwiched between a cluster of hydrophobic residues  on one side  and the guanidinium group of arg <dig> on the other . a salt-bridge interaction between arg <dig> and asp <dig> helps to determine the structure in this part of the active site and asp <dig> also interacts with the side chain of asn <dig> .

the structure of badhps in complex with pteroic acid  <cit>  shares most of the key interactions described above. a notable difference between pteroic acid and  <dig> -dihydropteroate is that n <dig> in the latter is a hydrogen bond donor, in the former a hydrogen bond acceptor. the distances between n <dig> and the carboxylate of the conserved asp <dig> in both structures are close to  <dig>  Å. this suggests to us that in the badhps ligand complex asp <dig> is likely protonated.

sulfonamides, which are used to treat infections by burkholderia  <cit> , inhibit dhps by binding in the p-aba binding site, as shown through competition, resistance and structural data  <cit> . the complex of ecdhps with sulfanilamide showed the ligand positioned between lys <dig> and arg <dig>  this is similar to the placement of the p-aba groups in the pteroic acid and  <dig> -dihydropteroate complexes, which are near to loop  <dig>  mutations in residues that contribute to loop  <dig> have been noted to correlate with resistance to sulfonamide and dapsone; in particular the equivalent residues to thr <dig> in bcdhps  <cit> . the alignment of three bacterial dhps sequences  shows that positions equivalent to  <dig> in our structure are occupied either with serine or arginine. given that ser <dig> interacts with the p-aba moiety the difference between serine and arginine has interesting implications regarding differences in ligand binding sites across species.

the availability of high-resolution crystal structures offers opportunities to exploit structure-based methods to derive information on dhps inhibitors that would support early stage drug discovery. the pterin binding pocket of dhps is highly conserved across species. in the enzyme:product complex for bcdhps we described the contributions of  <dig> amino acids above; ten of these residues are strictly conserved  and two, gly <dig> and met <dig>  only use main chain functional groups to bind the  <dig> -dihydropteroate. the structures clearly reveal the necessity for a planar entity and the arrangement of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors required to optimize interactions in the pterin binding pocket. the presence of an ordered water molecule mediating interactions between the ligand the enzyme suggests a position where a new hydrogen bonding interaction might be sought. unfortunately the disorder  of loop  <dig> means that many of the crystal structures have limitations with respect to drug design. we were fortunate that the product complex of bcdhps allowed us to model loop  <dig> and the complete structure we obtained provides an improved template suited for in silico screening. we recognize that there is flexibility around the edge of the active site part of the binding site and that this flexibility might make an important thermodynamic contribution to dhps function. this observation suggests that ligands able to interact with and reduce conformational freedom of loop  <dig> have the potential to increase the free energy of ligand binding, as might substrate, and these could provide suitable chemical matter for future development.

a potential cys-arg sulfenamide bond
during refinement of the bcdhps:dihydropteroate complex we noted an unusual feature in, first the electron density surrounding the side chains of cys <dig> and arg <dig>  and then in omit difference maps that is worthy of mention. the density suggested the possibility of a covalent linkage, possibly a sulfenamide bond between cys <dig> sg and arg <dig> nh <dig> . the crystallographic analysis of the apo-enzyme clearly showed the normal side chains not interacting with each other . our first assessment was that conformational flexibility had produced a mixture of rotamers that were overlapping. however, there is no evidence of an alternative rotamer for either residue. we were surprised that the feature was conserved in each subunit of the asymmetric unit and sought data to identify if an unusual covalent linkage was present. the analysis of freshly purified protein solution using fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and top-down fragmentation failed to find any evidence for an unusual s-n covalent linkage. similarly analysis of dhps crystals, from the same batch of protein that gave the complex structure, by trypsin cleavage followed by mass spectrometry did not find any evidence to substantiate s-n bond formation.

these residues are located towards the c-terminal end of α <dig>  at the surface of the protein and contribute to the dimer interface. the residues are not conserved in orthologues, and any interaction is unlikely to be physiologically relevant. a covalent modification may have occurred due to the experimental conditions in this particular instance and would likely have followed from oxidation of the cysteine.

CONCLUSIONS
the structure of b. cenocepacia dhps has been solved in the presence and absence of a product from the reaction that it catalyses,  <dig> -dihydropteroate. these structures closely resemble published dhps structures from other species. loop  <dig> has been modeled in the bcdhps product complex. this loop, which is highly conserved in terms of amino acid sequence and inherently flexible, makes important contributions to the creation of the active site. the structure of the bcdhps: <dig> -dihydropteroate complex, with loop  <dig> modeled provides a useful template to aid the design of new inhibitors of this enzyme.
