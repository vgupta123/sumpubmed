BACKGROUND
mitochondrial phylogeography is a useful tool for the study of wild populations  <cit> . but applying phylogeography to domestic species is more complicated. for example, the arrival of dogs into the new world was not a simple expansion of asian dog populations, but a consequence of human migrations  <cit> . humans have a history of population movements and social changes over the last ten thousand years  <cit> , and this, together with the human-mediated breeding history has affected the genetic composition of livestock animals  <cit> . therefore, human influence cannot be neglected when studying patterns of genetic diversity in domesticates.

a classic example of the use of mitochondrial dna  diversity to infer the history of domestication refers to dogs . four to six mitochondrial haplogroups  have been described in genetic studies of modern dogs  <cit> , indicating recurrent domestication or backcrosses between domestic dogs and wild wolves . three of the major hgs are distributed throughout the world, whereas one  is restricted to europe, especially in breeds originating in scandinavia  <cit> . similar patterns of fragmented genetic diversity have been used to argue for local domestication in other species  <cit> . such scenario could apply to dogs as they appear as early as  <dig> years ago in scandinavia  <cit> , and as dogs and wolf remains have been found on the same sites  <cit> .

we have genetically typed mtdna from ancient scandinavian dog remains to investigate whether the high frequency of a rare dog hg in northern europe is evidence of a local domestication event. we predict that an early domestication event in scandinavia would be visible in a notable frequency of hg d in ancient scandinavian dog remains.

RESULTS
reproducible sequence data for the full  <dig> bp sequence was recovered from  <dig> samples. the remaining six specimens only yielded reproducible sequence data for a shorter  <dig> bp product . phylogenetic reconstruction including the  <dig> prehistoric dogs that yielded complete sequences and  <dig> modern dog sequences  <cit>  revealed that all prehistoric dogs grouped within modern hgs . seven of the  <dig> sequences belonged to hg a, the group that encompasses more than 70% of all tested modern dogs around the world  <cit> , while the remaining eleven belonged to the now rare hg c. previously published data on  <dig> swedish dogs indicated frequencies of the four major hgs: a  <dig> %, b  <dig> %, c  <dig> %, and d  <dig> %  <cit> . when only native scandinavian breeds were considered , the haplotype frequency for hg d increased to  <dig> %  <cit> . a comparison of the  <dig> bp sequences obtained from the ancient dog specimens  and the contemporary native breeds indicates that the frequency of hg d is significantly reduced in the ancient data set . the remaining six ancient scandinavian dogs that yielded only  <dig> bp of reproducible sequence data, also indicated an absence of hg d . in total, eleven sequences had substitution patterns indicative for hg a, while the remaining  <dig> had a substitution indicative for hg c .

when the complete ancient dataset was compared to the contemporary dataset, it proved equally improbable  that hg d was present in the oldest specimens in a frequency similar to that observed in modern dogs. using a binomial distribution, we estimate that the frequency of hg d must have been lower than  <dig>  in the original population for us not to have noticed it in  <dig> samples , and lower than  <dig>   <dig> during the neolithic for us not to have noticed it in  <dig> samples . lastly, the χ <dig> test between the hg frequencies of the complete ancient dataset with that of the complete scandinavian  demonstrated a significant deviation between the modern and ancient frequencies .

our results indicate that hg frequencies have been altered in scandinavian dogs since their first arrival. interestingly, while hg c is overrepresented in our ancient material, there is a complete lack of the scandinavian group d in our ancient dataset. hg d is the one that could support a scandinavian origin whereas hg c is suggested to be of asian origin  <cit> . thus, we find no obvious evidence for prehistoric canid domestication in scandinavia. an external origin of scandinavian dogs is supported by morphologic data, as even the oldest remains of dogs in scandinavia were of smaller size than those of prehistoric and extant wolves  <cit> . while canid domestication may have occurred in other parts of europe  <cit> , scandinavian dogs were likely imported and had experienced a long period of morphological change under human control before they reached the scandinavian peninsula.

CONCLUSIONS
in a wider context, our data calls for caution when using modern sequences of domestic animals to interpret the history of domestication. there is a profound difference on selective forces on wild and domestic animals. domesticates are subject to constant manipulation and follow the same historic vicissitudes as the associated human population. for example, genetic diversity may change rapidly due to intense selective breeding, backcrossing with the wild ancestor  <cit> , migration of human groups with genetically different domesticates  <cit> , and decimation of local populations by invaders  <cit> . hg frequency could change over a short period of few generations. while diversity and branching pattern of mitochondrial dna may be used to study the number and possible antiquity of domestication events, phylogeographical patterns in domestic species may indeed not be suitable to base discussion on their geographical origin. close collaboration between zooarchaeologists and molecular biologists, involving the study of ancient specimens, may be the only way to verify the continuity through time of the species that have set the basis of our culture.
