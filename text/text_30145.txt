BACKGROUND
one of the critical considerations in cereal breeding is the selection of reduced height  genes. this is because different rht genes do not only affect height differently but may also have different effects on other morphological and agronomic traits of importance  <cit> . it is known that different rht genes can confer dwarfism by different mechanisms. two of the most widely used rht genes in wheat, rht-b1b and rht-d1b, are known to encode della proteins which repress ga responsive growth. they are thought to confer dwarfism by producing constitutively active forms of these growth repressors  <cit> . rht <dig>  however, is not due to defective ga biosynthesis, but to a reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids  <cit> .

in addition to their roles in plant development, della proteins are believed to differentially affect responses to infections by biotrophic or necrophic pathogens through their influence on the salicylic acid - jasmonic acid balance in arabidopsis <cit> . similar claims were also made recently for wheat and barley by investigating della-producing rht genes in these species  <cit> . the possibility that della genes may play a critical role in disease resistance could drastically impact the efforts of cereal breeding as it could further restrict the options breeders have in exploiting the limited numbers of useful rht genes in each of these crop species. many previous studies show that rht genes, which may or may not produce della proteins, co-locate with qtl conferring fusarium head blight  and fusarium crown rot  resistance  <cit> . considering that accurate assessments for both fcr  <cit>  and fhb  <cit>  are difficult and that resistances to these diseases can be affected by many characteristics including plant height  <cit>  and growth rate  <cit>  which often segregate in populations used for qtl mapping, it is not difficult to understand why not all plant height qtl are coincident with those for fhb or fcr susceptibility  <cit> .

as opposed to segregating populations where individuals have different genetic backgrounds as well as the disease resistance loci under investigation, differences between the two isolines for a given pair of nils are often minimal apart from the targeted trait. thus, assessing genetic effects of a particular gene/trait using nils can, to a large degree, eliminate the interference of other genes. as a result, nils are extensively used for analysing effects of a wide array of traits including possible effects of plant height on fhb and fcr. these studies have shown that all rht genes, including those non-ga-responsive ones, affect fhb  <cit>  and fcr  <cit>  resistance in wheat. these results seem to suggest that the effects of plant height on these fusarium diseases are unlikely related to della genes. to further clarify if the effects of plant height on fusarium resistance are related to della genes, we generated several pairs of nils for the non-ga-responsive semi-dwarfing gene uzu in barley. responses of these nils to fcr infection are described in this paper.

RESULTS
development and assessment of near isogenic lines for the semi-dwarfing gene uzu with the use of the ssr marker hmv <dig>  ten heterozygous plants were identified from the tx9425/franklin population and five from the tx9425/gairdner population. similar to those individuals with homozygous franklin or gairdner alleles, all of the  <dig> heterozygous individuals were characterized as tall plants. however, each of these individuals produced both tall and dwarf progenies. the two isolines for each of the  <dig> pairs of nils developed from these heterozygous individuals showed highly significant difference in height under both temperature regimes assessed . in the low temperature regime, the average plant height across the  <dig> dwarf isolines was  <dig>  cm and the  <dig> tall isolines was  <dig>  cm thus the uzu gene reduced height by  <dig> % on average. in the high temperature regime, the average plant height for the  <dig> dwarf isolines was  <dig>  cm and the  <dig> tall isolines was  <dig>  cm thus the uzu reduced height by  <dig> % on average. when compared with its effects in the low temperature regime, the average impact of the uzu gene on plant height increased in the high temperature regime by  <dig> % on average .

comparisons of genomic dna sequences among the three parental genotypes used in the development of the nils confirmed the existence of the uzu allele  <cit>  in tx <dig>  the characteristic single-nucleotide a > g substitution of uzu at the position  <dig> was the only difference detected along the whole uzu gene sequence among the three genotypes . analysis of the  <dig> pairs of nils using the dcap markers detected the expected uzu allele from each of the  <dig> dwarf isolines .

differences in fusarium crown rot severity among the nils
difference in disease index  between the two isolines was highly significant for each of the  <dig> pairs of nils under both of the temperature regimes assessed. similar to its impacts on plant height, the semi-dwarfing gene uzu also showed larger effects on fcr severity in the high temperature regime than in the low temperature regime. in the low temperature regime, the average di value across the  <dig> dwarfing isolines was  <dig>  and that for the  <dig> tall isolines was  <dig> , thus the uzu gene reduced di by  <dig> % on average. in the high temperature regime, the average di was  <dig>  across the  <dig> dwarfing isolines and was  <dig>  across the  <dig> tall isolines thus the uzu gene reduced di by  <dig> % on average .

a trend similar to that based on di values was observed when fcr severity was assessed by estimated biomasses of the fusarium pathogen. the difference between the two isolines was highly significant for each of the  <dig> pairs of nils assessed under both of the temperature regimes. the uzu allele reduced fusarium biomass by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, on average across the  <dig> pairs of nils in the low and high temperature regimes when tri <dig> was used as the reference gene . when 18 s was used as the reference gene, the uzu gene reduced fusarium biomass on average by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, across the  <dig> pairs of nils in the low and high temperature regimes . differences in fusarium biomass between the two isolines for each of the  <dig> pairs of nils were significantly larger in the high temperature regime when compared with those in the low temperature regime based on the use of either tri <dig>  or 18 s .

correlation between fusarium crown rot severity and plant height
plant height was significantly and positively correlated with fcr severity. when fcr severity was measured with di, the correlation coefficients were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for data obtained from the low and the high temperature regimes, respectively. when pathogen biomass was used in measuring fcr severity, the correlation coefficients were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the low and high temperature regimes, respectively, when tri <dig> was used as the reference gene. the correlation coefficients were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the two different temperature regimes, respectively, when 18 s was used as the reference gene .

discussion
the possibility that della genes could play a critical role in disease resistance in cereals  <cit>  could seriously restrict options breeders may have in exploiting the limited numbers of useful rht genes in wheat or barley. to further investigate this possibility, we generated  <dig> pairs of nils for the semi-dwarfing barley gene uzu. these nils were assessed under two environments between which significant differences in plant height between the two isolines for a given pair of nils were detected. highly significant difference in fcr resistance was detected between the two isolines for each of the nil pairs and the magnitudes of the differences in fcr resistance are associated with the magnitudes of differences in plant height. it is known that the semi-dwarfism conferred by uzu is not due to changed sensitivity to ga but to brassinosteroids  <cit> . thus, the results from this study showed that plant height affects fcr resistance in barley and that the height effects are unlikely related to della genes but due to direct or indirect effects of height difference per se.

results from previous studies also show that all rht genes, including those non-ga-responsive ones, affect fcr in wheat  <cit> . there is no ‘cause-and-effect’ that can be implied at this stage yet. however, one of the possible explanations for the reduced fcr severities of the dwarf isolines in both wheat and barley could be their increased cell densities. considering that fcr is measured by the speed of disease spread within the infected tissues  <cit> , the increased cell densities of dwarfing lines  <cit>  could form increased physical barriers to pathogen spread within infected tissues. this explanation is supported by the findings that treating plants with exogenous ga increased cr severity as well as seedling lengths in all of the isolines tested, and that the better resistance of the dwarf isolines did not seem to be related to enhanced induction of defense genes  <cit> . it is known that the growth response of wheat seedlings to exogenous ga application is due to cell expansion not cell division  <cit> . further evidence supporting the explanation that the increased cell density is likely a contributing factor to the reduced fcr severity is that slow growing genotypes tend to give better cr resistance  <cit> . it is well known that the genetic control of growth rate is complex and can be conditioned by multiple genes including those for vernalization, photoperiod responses as well as those independent of vernalization and day-length  <cit> . nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to speculate that, when compared with those quick growing genotypes, stem elongation of those slow growing genotypes is slower thus their cell densities at stem bases would stay higher for a longer period of time  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by generating and investigating several pairs of nils for a non-ga-responsive rht gene, we demonstrated in this study that the observed effects of plant height on fcr resistance are not related to della genes in barley. these results agree well with previous data on both fcr and fhb in wheat showing overwhelmingly that the observed effects of plant height on resistances to fcr or fhb can be explained by direct or indirect effects of plant height difference per se. results from the interactions between rht loci and fusarium resistance highlight the importance of understanding the possible relationships between resistance and other traits of agronomic importance. it is critical to understand that the value of a resistance gene in breeding programs could be compromised if it dramatically affects plant development and morphology. the effects of rht genes on fusarium diseases described in this paper showed specifically that caution should be taken when considering exploiting any of the numerous fhb or fcr resistance loci co-locating with rht genes in wheat or barley.
