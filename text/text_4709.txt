BACKGROUND
body composition, including the distribution and composition of fat and muscle, is of great interest in a number of species. in humans it is predictive of health outcomes, and in cattle and sheep it affects the efficiency of meat production and the value and healthiness of the meat. genetic variation in these traits is well documented. in humans the heritability of body mass index has been estimated to be  <dig>   <cit> . the genetic architecture of body mass index  appears to be highly polygenic, with the  <dig> loci of largest estimated effect accounting for ∼  <dig>  % of bmi variance  <cit> . in cattle and sheep, carcass composition traits have similar heritabilities to bmi in humans .

genome wide association studies have been very successful at finding genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms , associated with body size and composition in humans and livestock  <cit> . in some cases, the gene through which the causal variant acts is clear and the physiological pathway to the phenotype is at least partly understood. however, sometimes the causal gene is ambiguous and often the physiological pathway is almost unknown. for instance, genetic variants near the gene lcorl have been implicated as affecting size in several species , but the mechanism by which they do this is unknown.

in identifying the genes involved and the mechanism by which they act, an advantage of studies in animal species is that more detailed phenotypes relating to body composition can be collected. for example, these can include the amounts of bone, muscle and fat and the chemical composition of the fat and muscle. since common physiological mechanisms  affect the growth of muscle, fat and bone and presumably the detailed composition of fat and muscle, detailed phenotypes should help to clarify the mechanism by which genetic variants affect these traits. for instance, selection for leanness and muscling led to reduced muscle oxidative capacity and iron concentration implying a change in the proportions of different muscle fibre types  <cit> .

in this study, we did not record muscle fibre type directly but did record phenotypes associated with fibre type. muscles vary in muscle fibre type composition  <cit> . muscles with a predominance of slow twitch  fibres have a higher capacity for fatty acid uptake and lipid oxidation, have abundant mitochondria, and are rich in myoglobin that is responsible for the red colour of meat. whereas, muscles requiring rapid contraction generating substantial force, such as some locomotory muscles, have a greater proportion of fast twitch fibres , which largely depend on glycolytic metabolism for energy generation and are whiter and have fewer mitochondria  <cit> . these muscles have lower activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase  which is crucial in the oxygen-dependent citric acid cycle of mitochondria  <cit> . the rate of protein turnover in muscle fibres, pre- and post-slaughter, affects the growth of muscle and the tenderness of the meat. for instance, in sheep the callipyge mutation increases muscle in the trunk and hind quarters and decreases tenderness  <cit> . thus, it is likely that genetic variants affect multiple traits associated with the growth of muscle and fat and their detailed composition.

it is often suggested that detailed phenotyping will aid the identification of genetic variants affecting complex traits and help to elucidate the pathway by which they act. here we test this hypothesis by phenotyping sheep for  <dig> traits associated with muscle and fat growth and composition.

usually gwas, for instance on human height and bmi, are analysed one trait at a time ignoring patterns of pleiotropy amongst these traits. however, the pattern of pleiotropy may help to identify the gene underlying an association and the mechanism through which it acts. bolormaa et al.  <cit>  showed that a multi-trait analysis, by combining the results from gwas on  <dig> individual traits in beef cattle, increased the power to detect pleiotropic qtl. they also showed that cluster analysis identified groups of qtl with similar patterns of pleiotropic effects. it would help us to identify the genes underlying qtl and to understand their mechanisms of action, if these groups of qtl represent genes with similar function or belonging to the same pathways.

in this study we have analysed  <dig> detailed body composition phenotypes on  <dig>  sheep with genotypes for  <dig>  snps. we have tested four hypotheses:that a multi-trait analysis increases power to detect and map qtl,

that detailed phenotyping increases power to identify the causal gene underlying the qtl and the mechanism by which it acts,

that variants in different genes that act in the same pathway have a similar pattern of effects across traits, and

that variants in the same genes affect growth and body composition in multiple species.



RESULTS
single-trait genome-wide association studies
in this study,  <dig>  sheep that had real or imputed genotypes for  <dig>  snps, were measured for up to  <dig> traits , and belonged to a large number of breeds . gwas, in which each snp was fitted one at time, were performed for  <dig> traits including carcass weight, fatness, muscling, tenderness, meat colour, and fatty acid  composition of fat . population structure was accounted for by fitting breed composition and a multi-generation pedigree. table  <dig> presents the number of significant  snps. twenty nine traits had more than  <dig> significant snps , resulting in a false discovery rate  of less than  <dig>  % .table  <dig> number of records, mean, standard deviation  and heritability estimate  of each trait for the genotyped animals

besides fdr, a q-q plot can demonstrate the rate of false positives as shown for  <dig> traits in fig.  <dig>  the q-q line deviates most from expectations in hgrfat, followed by cema, shearf <dig>  and fa_c22_5n <dig>  which is consistent with fdr results being lowest in hgrfat. the deviation of the q-q plots from expectation  is evidence of polygenic inheritance  <cit> , not inflation of the test statistic due to population structure, which has been well captured in our analysis by fitting breed and pedigree . many significant snps were clustered together within narrow regions on chromosome   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in a number of cases, those snps had associations with more than one trait.fig.  <dig> quantile-quantile plot of p-values from single snp genome wide association study of hgrfat , cema , shearf <dig> , and fa_c22_5n <dig> , and from multi-trait analysis . observed and expected p-values would fall on the light blue line if there was no association. the top horizontal line is p <  <dig> , middle horizontal line is p <  <dig> , and the bottom horizontal line is p <  <dig> 



multi-trait analysis to detect pleiotropy
combining the single trait gwas in a multi-trait meta-analysis using a method described by  <cit>  resulted in  <dig> significant snps  . this corresponded to a fdr of  <dig>  %, which was lower than for any individual trait tested in the single-trait gwas, except legbone.fig.  <dig> the manhattan plot showing the –log <dig>  of snps of the multi-trait test of the whole genome  before  and after  fitting  <dig> lead snps in the model



to avoid testing a large number of closely linked snps, only the most significant snps  within each 1 mb window  was selected from the multi-trait analysis in the discovery set  for validation in an independent set of animals . for each of  <dig> significant snps , we performed a multiple regression analysis in which the snp genotype is the dependent variable and the  <dig> phenotypes are the independent variables. this resulted in a linear index of  <dig> traits that had the maximum correlation with genotypes of one of the corresponding  significant snps. the association between a snp and its corresponding linear index was subsequently tested in the validation sample. out of the  <dig> snps that were found significant in the discovery sample,  <dig> were significant  in the validation sample and all had an effect in the same direction in the validation sample as in the discovery sample . this number validated  was higher than for any single trait , showing that multi-trait analysis detected and validated more associations than any single-trait analysis.table  <dig> number of significant snps  in reference population that were also significant in the validation population

conditional analyses accounting for  <dig> lead snps
the multi-trait analyses identified many narrow regions, containing more than one significant snps . we selected  <dig> ‘lead snps’  , which were significant and not closely linked and therefore presumably tagging  <dig> independent qtl across the ovine genome. table  <dig> lists their t values across all  <dig> traits. we then tested whether the selected snplead were perfectly tagging qtl in their respective regions by rerunning all single trait gwas, while simultaneously fitting all  <dig> snplead . then the meta-analysis combining all traits was repeated. all  <dig> lead snps remained significant when fitted jointly suggesting that each is likely to tag a different qtl. fitting the  <dig> snps substantially reduced the number of significant snps near the snplead , showing that the snplead is in high linkage disequilibrium with the qtl in the region. however, in some cases , snps close to the snplead remained significant after fitting all  <dig> snplead, which may indicate that the snplead is in imperfect ld with the causal mutation or that there are multiple qtl in the region. in fact, there were still many significant snps  scattered throughout the genome after fitting the  <dig> snplead indicating that there are likely to be many more smaller qtl affecting the  <dig> traits.table  <dig> total number of significant snps , their fdr , and number of significant snp on each chromosome  for the  <dig> linear indexes corresponding to the  <dig> lead snps

cluster analysis to find qtl with a similar pattern of effects across traits
the correlation of effects across all  <dig> traits was calculated for all pairs of snplead . while the correlation of effects for the snplead  <dig>  and the snplead  <dig>  was more than  <dig> , most correlations were moderate to low. a moderate to low correlation suggests qtl with different patterns of effects across traits, however, sampling errors in estimating snp effects also reduce the absolute value of the correlation. if two qtl affect the same physiological pathway one might expect them to have the same pattern of effects and, hence, a higher correlation. cluster analysis of the  <dig> snplead  based on the correlation matrix divided them into  <dig> loosely defined groups , which shared patterns of effects across traits .fig.  <dig> correlation matrix between the  <dig> lead snps calculated from snp effects on  <dig> traits



group  <dig> consisted of  <dig> snplead on oar  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . this group clustered as an outer branch , indicating that this group of snps was distinct from the other  <dig> groups. table  <dig> shows that these  <dig> snplead increased carcass and skeletal weights and lean meat yield and decreased dressing percentage, fatness, and muscling. they could be described as changing mature  size.

group  <dig> consisted of  <dig> snplead . these snplead had an allele that increased the concentration of saturated fa with carbon chain of c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  and decreased stearic acid  and/or some unsaturated fa . there was also a tendency for the allele that increased saturated fa composition to also increase fatness . they could be described as changing fat composition.

group  <dig> consisted of  <dig> snplead that influenced meat retail colour  and decreasing lightness of meat ) and increased myoglobin and wet iron content in muscle. however, on other traits, they separated into two subgroups . one sub-group consisted of  <dig> snps  that increased meat tenderness , eye muscle area and eye muscle depth, glycogen, isocitrate dehydrogenase  activity, and polyunsaturated fa  level and decreased meat ph level . the other sub-group contained  <dig> snps , and  <dig> of them  had decreased meat tenderness and increased top side, loin weight and eye muscular area. additionally, the 13th snplead  decreased intramuscular fatness and increased leanness. they could be described as influencing meat colour and eating quality.

group  <dig> consisted of  <dig> snplead . correlations between these snplead were only moderate and they were also moderately correlated with some snplead from group  <dig> . this group tended to influence meat colour and polyunsaturated  fa levels . additionally, the 14th snplead decreased muscling and the 16th snplead significantly decreased icdh activity and omega- <dig> and - <dig> fa levels. they could be described as affecting meat colour and fa composition.

group  <dig> consisted of  <dig> snps, which were less correlated and do not form a consistent group . the 17th snp  increased glycogen content and meat redness , and decreased ultimate ph  . this was similar to the 10th and 9th snplead in group  <dig>  but it did not affect tenderness. the 23rd snplead  increased hot carcass weight and dressing percentage and decreased iron content. each of the other  <dig> snps  in this group had a significant effect on specific traits including fa composition or fatness or tenderness.

searching for more qtl in the same pathway using linear indices of snplead
genes that operate in the same pathway might be expected to show the same pattern of pleiotropic effects. we wanted to harness the power of our multi-trait analysis to add additional qtl to the  <dig> broad functional groups. for each of the  <dig> lead snps, we used the same linear index as was used previously to validate the snp effects. that is, we calculated the linear combination of the  <dig> traits that was most highly correlated with the genotypes at each of the snplead  <cit> . then we performed new gwas using the linear index as if it was a new trait. all snplead were also fitted simultaneously in the gwas, as we were primarily interested in finding additional qtl to those captured by the snplead. this process added a total of  <dig> significant snps  that were assigned to the same group as the snplead whose linear index was used as the phenotype . usually this procedure identified a set of closely linked snps, presumably indicating a single qtl.

identifying plausible candidates
we searched for genes within genomic regions of 30 kb up and downstream from each of  <dig> snps from linear index gwas and the  <dig> snplead. if there were multiple significant snps within a 60 kb window only the most significant snp was taken forward. the closest gene was chosen as a likely candidate. in one exception , we expanded the 60 kb range as the nearest gene  was 78 kb away . this identified  <dig> snps in or close to potential candidate genes . table  <dig> lists these genes in genome position order.table  <dig> list of plausible candidate genes

a
tp <dig> and b
scd genes which were mapped near this region could be the plausible candidates



in group  <dig>   <dig> snps  were annotated to possible candidate genes . the function of ghr makes this gene a plausible member of a group affecting mature size and exogenous administration of growth hormone leads to increased growth and decreased fatness which is the phenotype of snplead  <dig> near the ghr gene. however, in general, the  <dig> genes in this group do not share an obvious biological function although  <dig>  genes have been associated with a similar phenotype in other species as discussed below. ncapg  is closely linked to lcorl, so there may be only one qtl in this region  <cit> . not surprisingly, the effects of snps near lcorl and ncapg are highly correlated. the snps tagging lcorl, slc16a <dig>  ghr, fryl, and bmpr1b were clustered together as one group within group  <dig>  and the effects of those snps were highly correlated .fig.  <dig> dendrogram drawn based on correlation matrix between the effects of the lead snps and their linear index snps within each group: a group  <dig> snps  along with their annotated gene names; b group  <dig> snps; and c group  <dig> snps. lead snps within each group are highlighted with blue stars; genes  are the alternative most likely putative candidates within the regions



the  <dig> snplead in group  <dig> were expanded with  <dig> additional snps from the linear index gwas and re-clustered within the group . the  <dig> snps tag only  <dig> different chromosomal regions and in  <dig> of these there is a gene directly involved in fa synthesis or fat synthesis  . although the closest gene to snplead  <dig> is snora <dig>  the analysis of the linear index derived from snplead  <dig>  identified a significant snp only 60 kb away whose nearest gene is elovl <dig>  which is a far more plausible candidate. acsl <dig>  acaca , fasn and evolv <dig> code for enzymes used in fatty acid synthesis and the snps near them all have an allele that increases the proportion of c <dig> to c <dig> saturated fas . usually fa synthesis does not proceed to chains longer than c <dig>  it is therefore understandable that the allele that increases c <dig> to c <dig> fas tends to increase total fatness . agpat <dig> encodes an enzyme used in triglyceride synthesis. the mlxipl protein activates carbohydrate response element motifs in the promoters of triglyceride synthesis genes. go and kegg analysis in string   <cit>  confirms this functional similarity between the genes near group  <dig> snps . for example, according to kegg and go terms,  <dig> proteins  were involved together in fa biosynthesis ,  <dig> proteins , agpat <dig>  and isyna1) in metabolic pathways , and  <dig> proteins  in lipid biosynthesis process .

group  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> snps including  <dig> snplead that were assigned in this group previously. we called group  <dig> snps “meat colour” snps because this is the most consistent feature of the group. the allele that made the meat redder and darker also tended to increase myoglobin and iron content, decrease ph and increase muscling. however, in other respects the snps in group  <dig> differ in their phenotypic effects. the 9th and 10th snplead decrease shear force while the 12th and 13th snplead increase it. considering the differences in phenotype and in the function of the candidate genes, there may be no single physiological process that is common to all snps in group  <dig> 

one group of snps were found within oar  <dig>  <dig> - <dig>  mb near meg <dig> , meg <dig>  dlk <dig>  oar-mir- <dig> , begain, and wars . this snp increases muscling and shear force which is the phenotype of the callipyge mutation which maps to the same region  <cit> . the callipyge mutation is not known to occur in australian sheep but the carwell mutation has a similar, but less dramatic phenotype, and maps to the same region  <cit>  so it is likely that the snplead  <dig> is tagging the carwell mutation. the snplead  <dig> tags cast and the linear index derived from this snp was significant for a snp tagging capn <dig>  both cast and capn <dig> have also been linked to tenderness in cattle . the effects of the snplead  <dig>  and  <dig>  were highly correlated . although these genes do not have similar functions, both decrease muscle protein turnover which may help to explain why they both increase muscling and decrease tenderness. the snplead  <dig>  was mapped near the genes apol <dig>  and mb  and was strongly associated with meat myoglobin content and also fa composition.fig.  <dig> the –log <dig>  of snp effects from the multi-trait test results for oar18_ <dig>  mb, where not all genes in this region are shown: the lead snp is shown by a purple diamond in each plot  and the ld between this variant and all others is colour coded



group  <dig> and  <dig> consist of a total of  <dig> snps which do not cluster tightly and do not show any obvious common mechanism although individual candidate genes do have a function closely related to the phenotypic effects of the snp tagging them. the snplead  <dig> at oar14_ <dig>  mb of group  <dig> has a strong association with muscle glycogen content but not with icdh activity  and mapped within the region of the gene gys <dig> . the snplead  <dig>  and  <dig>  mapped near genes fads <dig>  and pnpla <dig> , respectively. in this study, these snps were strongly associated with poly-unsaturated fa concentration. similarly, the linear index of the 21th snplead  was associated with a snp only 100 kb from the snplead and close to the gene elovl <dig> . this snplead had a strong positive effect  on docosapentaenoic acid , but not with eicosapentaenoic acid  . elovl <dig> adds  <dig> carbons to polyunsaturated long chain fas so it is a logical candidate for the effect of both snps. the same pattern of effects of a snp in elovl <dig> was observed in the human goldn study  <cit> . furthermore, scd , which is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, primarily the synthesis of oleic acid  by desaturation of stearic acid , was located just in 45 kb away from the 15th snplead  . so, scd may be a plausible candidate gene for this region. we investigated further if there were any significant snps near or within scd, which are in ld with the snplead oar22_ <dig>  mb. there were  <dig> significant snps , located  <dig>  kb- <dig>  kb upstream to the scd gene and all  <dig> were in ld  with this snplead .

do these candidate genes affect similar phenotypes in other species?
comparison with cattle
of the genes in table  <dig> ,  <dig>  were also highly significant and had similar effects in a multi-trait analysis of beef cattle  <cit> . of the other genes found by  <cit> , in this study we found  <dig> snps  within the region of gene lepr,  <dig> snp  within hmga <dig>   <dig> snp  within plin <dig>  and  <dig> snp  within pacrg. saatchi et al.  <cit>  also found qtl regions harbouring genes associated with growth including plag <dig>  lcorl, ncapg, and hmga <dig> in their gwas in  <dig>  animals from  <dig> us beef cattle breeds.

comparison with human gwas
we also investigated the overlap of our qtl with genes associated with height, bmi, waist to hip ratio, and obesity in humans, which are well documented and have been validated in multiple studies. we selected the bmi and bmi-related gene lists reported in  <dig> recent human meta-analyses . in total,  <dig> unique genes from these  <dig> studies  were tested.  <dig> of these genes could be mapped to positions on the sheep reference genome . we detected  <dig> snps that were significant  in our meta-analysis and that mapped to  <dig> of the  <dig> human genes . in  <dig>  permutations of the data we did not observe a case with these many snps and genes overlapping between the human and sheep results. these  <dig> genes included ppargc1a  and plcd <dig> , and the two genes identified by the linear index of the 10th snplead, cyp27a <dig> and erbb <dig>  plcd <dig>  cyp27a <dig> and erbb <dig> map near each other so it is uncertain how many causal mutations are involved . we also detected  <dig> snps with p values from 8 × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> near the gene ftl , which is known to be strongly associated with human obesity and carriers of the risk allele reported to have increased appetite  <cit> . the position of ftl gene in ovine genome was partially overlapped with gys <dig> gene.

we also evaluated the overlap between the sheep gwas results described above and gwas for human height. out of  <dig> snps annotated to  <dig> genes associated with human height  <cit> ,  <dig> genes mapped to the sheep reference genome and  <dig> snps which were significant  in our meta-analysis mapped to  <dig> of these  <dig> human genes. again in  <dig>  permutations we did not observe a case with this much overlap between sheep and human lists. out of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps at p < 10− <dig> were mapped within or near  <dig> genes which was presented in additional file 3: table s <dig>  these  <dig> genes  <cit>  included lcorl , ghr , and mark <dig> . gene tp <dig> from  <cit>   was located on oar <dig> at  <dig>  mb, which is close to gene slc16a <dig> that was near the 3rd snplead in group  <dig>  so tp <dig> might be the plausible candidate gene in this region.

discussion
multi-trait analysis increases power
we have demonstrated that for a wide range of carcass and fat composition traits, a multi-trait gwas strategy  detected and validated more qtl than simple single-trait gwas. the fdr was low for the majority of traits studied . the q-q plot deviated from expectation at very low values of –log <dig>  for the multi-trait analysis but, since we fitted a breed and a polygenic effect in the model, this deviation is not likely due to uncontrolled population structure. this type of deviation from expectation is observed if many loci cause genetic variation for a particular trait  <cit> . the increase in power from the multi-trait analysis was possibly due to the fact that all traits measure aspects of muscle and fat growth and thus share some underlying biological mechanisms.

candidate genes
the gene closest to the most significant snp is not necessarily the gene responsible for the effect on phenotype. however, in some cases the candidate genes in tables  <dig> and  <dig> are likely to be correct based on two sources of evidence. in some cases the known function of the candidate gene fits the observed phenotype very well. for instance, the gene glycogen synthase is a good candidate for affecting muscle glycogen concentration. in other cases, the same gene has been reported to affect the same trait in another species. for instance, lcat affects mature size in cattle even though a causal relationship is not apparent from a metabolic biochemsitry perspective  <cit> . both types of evidence support some candidates such as cast, capn <dig>  and ghr. however, in some cases we identified more than one closely linked genes as candidates. the causal gene could be any one of these or, in some cases, multiple causal variants may exist in the same region. for instance, the effects of snplead  <dig> involve both myoglobin content and fa composition which suggest that both mb and apol <dig> play a role.

do detailed phenotypes help to identify the causal gene?
in some cases they do. for instance, the group  <dig> genes have a large effect on fa composition and a small effect on fatness. without the fa data, their effect on fatness would have been overlooked. similarly, gys <dig> has a large effect on muscle glycogen and ph and a smaller effect on other traits. these cases might be described as measuring a phenotype which is close to the primary action of the gene. for instance, gys <dig> codes for the enzyme that synthesises glycogen. by contrast, traits such as body weight are far removed from the direct action of any one gene. when a gene codes for an enzyme it is easier to specify a phenotype close to the primary action of the gene  than in many other cases.

do qtl with similar patterns of effects across traits tag genes in the same pathway?
we used two methods to identify snps with a similar pattern of associations across traits–clustering the lead snps and using a linear index designed for one snp to find others with similar effects. the genes that cluster together in group  <dig> belong to the fat synthesis pathway but the candidate genes in other groups do not share an obvious pathway or mechanism. using the linear index derived from one snplead did, in some cases, find other genes in the same pathway. for instance, the linear index that best predicts the cast genotype shows a significant effect of the genotype at capn <dig> and the index based on gys <dig> found ppp1r3a. in other cases the clusters do not seem to belong to a common pathway. it seems likely that “mature size” can be affected by many pathways. nevertheless, the pattern of effects across traits of snplead  <dig> and  <dig> are so similar that there must be some biological connection. the snplead  <dig> is close to lcorl/ncapg  while snplead  <dig> is slc16a11/alox12/tp <dig>  slc16a <dig> is a monocarboxylate transporter and it does not seem a good candidate for affecting mature size. alox <dig> is arachidonate  <dig> lipoxygenase, which oxidizes arachidonic acid to a spectrum of bio-active lipid mediators.

genes related to fat synthesis occurred in groups other than group  <dig>  possibly because fa traits are over represented in our  <dig> traits. for instance, in group  <dig> are pnpla <dig>  fads <dig> and evovl <dig>  when all  <dig> candidate genes in table  <dig> are considered,  <dig> have a direct involvement in lipid metabolism. even when the  <dig> genes in group  <dig> and these  <dig> genes named above are removed there are still  <dig> ‘lipid’ genes, many of which are involved in intra-cellular signalling using lipids, particularly the pi3k pathway. pi3k hydrolyses pip <dig> to ip <dig>  and dag , which are second messengers. the pi3k pathway connects extracellular signals, such as gpcr and typosine kinase receptors, to key molecules such as akt and mtor which integrate signals related to energy and nutrient status, and which in turn regulate many activities such as cell growth and cycling, apoptosis and glucose metabolism  <cit> . for instance, plcd <dig>  and plcb <dig> are phospholipases that cleave pip <dig>  into the second messengers ip <dig> and dag . isyna <dig> is ip <dig> synthase  <dig>  proca <dig> also has phospholipase activity. pi4k2b generates pip <dig>  a starting point for other pi messengers. the linear index derived from plcd <dig> was significant for a snp close to prkaa <dig> that is a part of amp kinase, which is important for energy homeostasis . ampk connects to the pi3k pathway via akt, which integrates many signals and in turn affects cell proliferation or apoptosis, and glucose metabolism. ghr and erbb have numerous connections to the pi3k pathway. lcat is a lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase and apol <dig> is an apolipoprotein that transports cholesterol. sgk <dig> is a kinase activated by signals that activate pi3k.

there are also a number of candidate genes associated with the cytoskeleton – fryl, myo1h, myo <dig>  myo <dig> was also found to affect growth traits in cattle. farp <dig> binds to both phospholipids and cytoskeleton and regulates integrin signalling and cell adhesion. arap <dig> is a pip <dig> dependent arf gap which regulates focal adhesion. the gene closest to snplead  <dig> is laminin alpha  <dig>  which codes for a major protein in the basement membrane involved in cell adhesion and signalling and is related to the pi3k pathway. tbck is thought to play a role in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell growth and proliferation via the mtor pathway. ampk, akt and mtor are critical controllers of energy use and protein synthesis.

thus a hypothesis can be formed that the collection of  <dig> traits that we have analysed is controlled, in part, by cytokine signals  mediated by intra-cellular signalling pathways, especially pi3k, that control energy homeostasis, insulin sensitivity  <cit>  and cell growth through effectors such as enzymes  and cell cytoskeleton changes. the gross effect of these pathways is that substrates get directed to different products  and eventually the balance of cell types  is affected.

signalling systems within the cell are complex and inter-connected so it probably does not make sense to think of a linear pathway with all genes in the pathway having a similar phenotypic effect. rather each gene has a unique position in a large network and therefore a unique pattern of pleiotropic effects. nevertheless, the similarity of phenotypes of snps in group <dig> suggests that they must share some common parts of the network. the hypothesis put forward here is that this involves signalling, often via pi3k, to ampk, akt and mtor.

application to sheep breeding
sheep breeders are keen to improve the genetic merit of their sheep for carcass and meat quality traits. the pattern of effects of each qtl studied here indicates that some would be more useful for selection than others. some qtl have an allele with desirable effects on more than one trait and appear to be good targets for selection. for instance, the qtl on oar  <dig>  has an allele that increases tenderness, improves meat colour , increases myoglobin, glycogen, and unsaturated  fatty acids and decreases saturated fatty acids, which is a highly valuable pattern. selection for this allele would be beneficial in sheep intended for most markets.

CONCLUSIONS
all traits appear to be highly polygenic with dozens to hundreds of snps  across the genome independently associated with each trait. the fdr was lower in the multi-trait analysis than in single trait analyses, showing that it had increased power to detect significant associations with this group of traits implying that many snps are associated with more than one trait. the detailed phenotyping of  <dig> related traits helped to identify convincing candidate genes in cases where the phenotype was closely related to the primary action of the gene . cluster analysis arranged the significant snps into  <dig> groups so that snps within a group had a similar pattern of phenotypic effects. the genes near group  <dig> snps, which are associated with fatness and fat composition, are predominantly genes involved in fa and fat synthesis. by contrast, the genes near snps in group  <dig>  which affect mature size, do not share a clear mechanism. however, these genes are also found in cattle and humans associated with size and fatness traits so it is unlikely that most of them are false associations. rather it indicates our lack of understanding of the many processes that control mature size. across the  <dig> groups there are many genes involved in lipid metabolism. these may act directly on measures of fatness but it seems likely that some of them are involved in signaling pathways within the cell. there was considerable overlap in the genes identified in our study and those reported to affect height and fatness in humans, and body composition in cattle. the incorporation of the identified causal mutations into genomic selection strategies could improve their accuracy and robustness, while allowing targeted selection to achieve more rapid genetic improvement.
