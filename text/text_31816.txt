BACKGROUND
in allowing simultaneous quantification of the expression level of thousands of genes, dna chip technology is part of the revolution in molecular biology towards a comprehensive understanding of cell biology at the genome scale, with considerable stake in improving patient classification  <cit>  and treatment. but the huge mass of information from chips has generated a number of difficulties in interpreting results, accentuated by both biological and technical sources of variability  <cit> . however, this technology is the only way to dissect biological pathways  <cit>  and distinguish statistically significant differences in pangenomic gene expression in a single experiment.

unsupervised analysis provides patient groups that are then compared by supervised analysis, like support vector machines  <cit> , classification trees  <cit> , neural networks  <cit>  or shrunken centroids  <cit> , and leading to functional gene signatures for hematological malignancies  <cit> . most importantly for clinical practice, the prediction of sample classes occurs whereby a classification system is trained by a known data set, then tested on a validation set, and finally used to predict classification  <cit> , prognosis  <cit>  or response to treatment  <cit>  for new hematology patients, with careful validation procedures  <cit> .

however, all of the previously published methods for supervised classification and prediction are based on fluorescence signal values, making all results dependent on the way individual chips in an experiment are normalized using one of the numerous low or high-level normalization methods . affymetrix® technology provides both a quantitative fluorescence signal and a decision  or absent  call) based on signed-rank algorithms  <cit>  applied to several spread hybridization repeats of matched and mismatched probes of each gene, with possible regional bias  <cit> . to skip the inter-chip normalization step  <cit>  and to make the method independent of the chip type, we developed a new prediction method for class belonging based on a statistically-assessed binary criterion of presence/absence of genes instead of expression levels, after normalization with mas <dig> or higher. biological data from normal donors  <cit>  and three groups of newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma  patients considered training and predicted groups, were obtained as previously described  <cit>  and statistical issues were addressed by bonferroni correction for multiple testing, leave-one-out and 5-fold cross-validation and validation with independent data  <cit> . the present paper reports the development of such predictors on trivial data  and a simple clinical application . training is achieved on data from different pooled chip types, and reveals powerful predictive capabilities when compared to the widely used prediction analysis of microarrays  run in parallel on the affymetrix-normalized signals. important applications potentially derived from this method for high throughput diagnostic, prognostic and drug response determinations point to a-la-carte treatment of cancer based on microarray data obtained at the time of diagnosis.

RESULTS
predictor building
training data were obtained by pooling samples from hybridizations either on both a and b chips  or p chips, having  <dig>  probe sets in common, named "ab+p" set thereafter.

each class is a collection of sample vectors containing binary variables:  <dig> for presence or  <dig> for absence for probe sets from the ab+p list.

a preliminary step to reduce the length of sample vectors and hence computational time is to shorten the initial gene list. this is readily obtained first by filtering out probe sets with no presence in samples, and second by keeping the most class-discriminating probe sets based on a χ <dig> test comparing the occurrences of presence/absence  among classes.

every sample of a class is then compared to every sample of the other for the expression of each probe set by creating a "xor" differential vector . a χ <dig> calculation on the occurrences of  <dig> is made between the differential vector and the null vector of same length. a sample to sample comparison for a set of genes is therefore characterized by first: a significance decision  if the χ <dig> is reached for a given, bonferroni-corrected p value , and second: the χ <dig> value itself corrected for the vector length  as an indicator of significance strength. the final class comparison consists of three values, the sum of all individual significance decisions , the overall strength as the sum of all x <dig>  and finally the smallest x <dig> for all the individual comparisons . for a given gene list, those three values are initialized. deletion of a gene without predictive power from the starting list of genes would result in improving at least one of the three preceding values. the principle of the list reduction to a predictor is therefore to remove each probe set one after the other from the initial list in order to compute the modifications of the three preceding values before returning it to the list, and definitely delete from the list the probe set the removal of which leads to the strongest improvement. the process stops when no further improvement is possible. mathematical inferences and algoritms are detailed in "methods".

whatever the stringency of the p value  for the data reduction step, the final predictor has the same length and content. when there are no longer non-significant comparisons between classes, deletions occur only by increasing f or x2min. figure  <dig> displays the evolution of f and x2min in the case of training a sex predictor. selection was made for pselection values from . <dig> to . <dig>  leading to initial lists from  <dig> to  <dig>  probe sets. the deletion process performed at a constant p value of . <dig> before bonferroni correction produced an identical  <dig> probe set predictor. however, the calculation time has been decreased by more than  <dig>  times over the pselection value range.

sex prediction
the present predictor building method was applied to predict sex by training with  <dig> samples of purified populations of memory b cells, bone marrow plasma cells and polyclonal plasma cells of healthy individuals separated into gender classes of  <dig> women and  <dig> men, respectively, and hybridized on a+b chips. with a pselection value set as described in previous section for discriminating the starting probe set selection, the final predictor found using bonferroni correction was a short list  <dig> probe sets encompassing  <dig> genes, all of which being not surprisingly located on the sex chromosomes. the predictor included the xist gene, clearly expressed by female samples, as well as genes located on the y chromosome and expressed by male samples. five commercial rna extracted from testis and hybridized in the same conditions were submitted to classification by successive introduction into either gender class. calculation of the resulting non-significant comparisons  resulted in classification as male with no error . leave-one-out cross validation was performed with the  <dig> possible sample removals and the whole process of establishing a discriminative gene list then deleting from it for predictor building was run, resulting in no classification error when left-out sample was returned to the correct gender class.

this predictor was then applied to the  <dig> mm patient group hybridized on p chips, by successively introducing them into m or f gender class, and calculating the corresponding ns. table  <dig> shows that 67/ <dig> female patients were accurately classified. the unclassified sample was rejected from male patients by y chromosome absence, but was excluded from women because of a too low xist gene level on p chips for "present" status. twenty-seven male patients out of a total of  <dig> were correctly classified as men, while the remaining  <dig> were rejected as male by non significant interclass comparisons, six being rejected by both gender classes and the other classified as a woman. in order to check for the male status of these misclassified patients, we used a standard short tandem repeat analysis that clearly evidenced a partial to complete loss of the y chromosome, as previously observed for about 20% of the elder mm patients  <cit> . thus, the present method allows to sort out these male patients with such a loss of y chromosome.

*: when the number of non significant comparisons is identical in both classes for the call predictor at a given precision of the bonferroni-corrected χ <dig> sample-to-sample comparisons, the p-value is increased by one log unit, adding intra-class errors to interclass ones, but still leading to a correct classification.

the signal data from the same patients used for training and testing were then applied to pam version  <dig>  following the software recommendations. an error threshold of  <dig>  was chosen both to minimize individual and overall misclassification errors in cross-validation when training, and to ensure a comparable predictor length. while the same five genes are common to both predictors, the pam one contains six probe sets for the xist gene. applying this predictor to the  <dig> mm patient test group showed that if all male patients were correctly classified independently of y chromosome deletion, only  <dig> women out of  <dig> were classified as such, while the remaining  <dig> were classified as men. as preceding, low signals of the xist gene on p chips, representing here 50% of the predictor probe sets, could explain the y chromosome overvalue and underline the weakness of using signals through different chip types.

monoclonal ig light chain prediction
when we focused on predicting immunoglobulin chains of monoclonal malignant plasma cell proliferation, training for light chain prediction was achieved with  <dig> mm patients, expressing  <dig> kappa  and  <dig> lambda  monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains as assessed by immunoelectrophoresis. this proportion is in agreement with the usual one third lambda/two third kappa light chain distribution in mm  <cit> . using either pselection ≤ 10- <dig> or 10- <dig> for χ <dig> analysis of discriminative probe sets on the sample classes led to starting lists of  <dig> or  <dig> probe sets. initial evaluation of interclass comparisons was then performed using a p value  ≤ . <dig> for χ <dig> calculation, corrected for multiple testing by dividing the precision by the length of the probe list. the  <dig> sample-to-sample comparisons were all significant with a starting  <dig> probe set list. so the mechanism by which deletions reduced the list to a final  <dig> probe set predictor implied  <dig> deletions by maximizing the fmax function, then  <dig> deletions by maximizing x <dig>  the same predictor was obtained with the  <dig> probe set list, but the computing time was  <dig> times longer. calculation of the error score  clearly showed that lambda light chains could be distinguished from kappa without errors at equal to or less than . <dig> risk, regardless of disease status, the associated heavy chain, or the presence of bence-jones chains. leave-one-out cross-validation was performed for each lambda and kappa samples through the whole procedure from selection of the discriminative probe set list to probe set deletion from that list, generating  <dig> predictors, all of which classifying the left-out sample without error when comparing the ns between the correct and the erroneous sample reintroduction. five-fold cross-validation was performed in the same way by separating patients into five groups and successively testing on each group the predictor trained on the others. three samples out of  <dig> were misclassified. finally, the same sample classes were subjected to a pam analysis using the affymetrix mas <dig> or gcos-normalized signals without further modifications. after cross-validation, the error threshold was set to minimize misclassification errors in training and led to a  <dig> probe sets predictor close to the  <dig> probe sets predictor obtained by our method. both predictors were then applied to the  <dig> mm patient group hybridized on p chips. for the call predictor, each new sample was successively introduced into light chain classes, and the corresponding ns was calculated. table  <dig> shows that the call predictor made no error, while 4/ <dig> patients were misclassified by pam as lambda when kappa.

monoclonal ig heavy chain prediction
training and validation were achieved under the same conditions as described above for the light chains with a  <dig> patient training group containing  <dig> iga  and  <dig> igg  monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chains as assessed by immunoelectrophoresis, a consistent proportion for mm patients. a  <dig> probe set predictor was extracted with bonferroni correction from a starting  <dig> probe set list, with no non-significant interclass comparison. leave-one-out cross-validation was performed with  <dig> sub-predictors, making no classifying error when correctly reintroducing the left-out sample. data from the test group were processed as previously for call predictor and pam classification, excluding the light chain and igd myeloma patients. table  <dig> displays one classification error  for the present method versus  <dig>  for pam. when the number of non significant comparisons is identical in both classes for the call predictor and hampers the classification decision, the stringency of the bonferroni-corrected χ2sample-to-sample comparisons is increased by one log unit. requirements in sample differences increase, adding intra-class errors to interclass ones, but still leading to a correct classification.

discussion
microarray technology is rapidly evolving. in order to be compared, gene expression profiling experiments should be performed with the same type of chips and normalized with the same method. this hampers the use of gene expression data obtained from different microarrays and studies. the present paper describes a new class predictor based on the affymetrix call, making it possible to put together data from different affymetrix microarray types. the call is complementary to the fluorescence signal measured in arbitrary units and indicates that a gene has a certain probability of being present  in or absent from a sample. the simultaneous hybridization to a series of perfectly matched and mismatched probes allows one to estimate local noise to threshold the expression and make a decision on the presence  <cit> . due to the increasing chip density, the number of match-mismatch repeats decreases as the number of probed genes increases and technology improves, but nonetheless the detection call strategy is kept by affymetrix. therefore, experiments performed on different affymetrix chip types should be comparable, provide they are normalized with compatible software . the availability of data for both training and testing is constantly growing but keeping with ascendant compatibility. in spite of controversial use of negative matches, affymetrix was the only way to provide a p/a algorithm until recent pan-p development using negative probe sets. this predictor method could now be applied to other microarray systems since the pan-p algorithm allows to allocate a p/a call to microarray signal data  <cit> . thorough signal normalization  <cit>  is necessary to deal with sample preparation, hybridization, washing and scanning variability. our technique using the affymetrix decision call avoids this hampering step, but on the other hand, puts on the same level call-decided present genes with highly variable expression , leading to the same weighting being given to genes in predictors that have highly dispersed expression. in addition, a gene was considered absent or present only by relying on the mas <dig> or gcos decision. cut-offs of p-values for detection calls were set at affymetrix default values, with marginal calls considered absent calls, although more recent techniques are now available  <cit> . a and b chips were used in parallel although highly expressed genes are overexpressed on the a chip compared to the b, which contains many genes that are rarely expressed. however, using the detection call overrides artificial inflating of the b chip intensities relative to the a ones.

bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing. while conservative, this technique is appropriate for selection from probe set lists large enough to prevent low sensitivity, and allowed us to show that by applying the predictor to a completely independent validation set, the built predictors were highly reliable, with sensitivity and specificity very close to 100%. the presence of outliers in immunoglobulin chain isotype detection was readily detected without a further specialized method  <cit> , and confirmed by reassessment of biological data.

beyond the initial step of data binarization, which is affymetrix-specific, selection of and deletion from the probe set list by considering that each sample group is a drawing of presence or absence of a gene list is a solution to the more general problem of classification with limited cardinality  and high dimensionality , making it possible to extend the present method to any classification of groups containing vectors of binary data. a preliminary process of dimensionality reduction is required  <cit> . in order to avoid dilution by uninformative genes, a first possibility is to select probe sets on the basis of their class discriminant capability, as measured in the present method by a χ <dig> test on binary values, or on continuous signal values with other statistics  <cit> . for such a reduction, pam uses a semi-supervised technique "shrinking" class centroids to the overall centroid for each probe set  <cit> . on the contrary, to preserve information from all probe sets, a second possibility is to transform the large feature space into a smaller one by a limited number of combinations of individual information, like principal component analysis in the simca method  <cit> .

in order to use a χ <dig> table, the calculated presence content of a class should not be less than  <dig>  otherwise the class should be combined with another one to reach the threshold. in this respect, some of our sample groups approach such a situation. the importance of the selection step is stressed in results: the number of selected probe sets influences the computational time without affecting the length and quality of the deduced predictor. the deletion and optimization process is in the order of  <dig> and the number of comparisons for each deletion increases as the product of each class content, practically restricting this starting length to less than  <dig> . probe sets are then individually removed from the selection list and the resulting significance of inter-class comparisons is evaluated with the remaining list. the initial number of non significant sample to sample comparisons ns is almost always null, since χ <dig> tends to be equal to the number of "1" in differential vectors when their length increases. therefore ns must be the first process cut-off if increased by any further deletion. if ns is unchanged, the second priority is the overall improvement of the significance, i.e. an increase in the sum f of residues, because it underlines the effect of a deletion on all comparisons simultaneously. and actually, if that priority level is given to improvement in the smallest residue, the final predictor is longer and less performing. since deletion decision for a probe set during the training sequence arises from updating maximized criteria between its removal and return, the present method resembles the forward-backward algorithm in hidden markov models  <cit> .

the prediction step is achieved by inserting the sample to predict for in each class successively and measuring the number of non significant errors generated by the samples of the other class. a well-classified sample should generate a low to null number of non significant comparisons when compared to the samples of the wrong class.

prediction for gender or ig light and heavy chain type was used to test for the method, but it is also useful to generate quality control when running chips on a per-patient basis. the prediction method described here is thus routinely used in our hands for the microarray report we generate for each patient with multiple myeloma at the university hospital of montpellier. it works well even with patients expressing bence-jones chains. this predictor method should help to select defined sets of genes with efficient prediction potential to design dedicated microarrays for multiplex quantitative assays. however, problems in sex determination in the context of myeloma arise from partial deletions of the y chromosome  <cit> . the present method excludes most of these patients from both gender class and allows classifying them as an entity. predicting chain isotype is straightforward, and may be used in everyday clinical practice. this also emphasizes that the present method is ideally suited for two-class classification by a unique score, when establishing a multiclass predictor needs as much scores as the number of classes minus  <dig> 

finally, preliminary results in predicting less clear-cut classes like mm clinical stages show that, although the number of starting non-significant errors  is not null, the present deletion process is able to reduce it to zero and further shorten the list by the two other criteria to clinically-relevant predictors.

as predictors are composed of "must be present" and "must be absent" probe sets for a sample group, the "present" part of the predictor is at least partly a signature of the group, a "molecular symptom" as recently suggested for stratification of clinical phenotypes  <cit> . this was obvious for the sex predictor, where all the genes predicting for male gender were on the y chromosome, and partly verified in the case of monoclonal component chains.

however, genes selected for prediction need not be biologically relevant. as pointed out by the microarray quality control-ii project  <cit> , validation of classifiers should not involve demonstrating that predictors are "validated biomarkers of disease status", and our method answers most of the evaluation criteria set for classifiers in this project.

in the space of probe sets, each sample could be described by a linear model with detection calls as independent variables. approaches like the ones used for mapping of categorical traits from quantitative loci  <cit>  could then be applied to generate a threshold model, allowing one to classify a sample independently of previous training or validation groups.

still, the present classifying method, using already processed call evaluation through standardized tools like mas <dig> or gcos, gives consistent results rapidly after the hybridization of patient samples at diagnostic on recent affymetrix chip type.

CONCLUSIONS
because of its superseding capabilities, the present call algorithm-based method looks particularly promising for further applications like diagnostic classification of monoclonal gammopathies, prognostic grouping and prediction of response to treatment. more widely, it can be used as a powerful tool to mine self-generated or literature data on all cancer types. and specially to perform classification of binary feature-containing samples.
