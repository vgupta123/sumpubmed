BACKGROUND
determining how wild plants have adapted to extreme environments can provide useful insight into how all plants respond to stress. in particular, researchers measure genetic differences among populations found in different environments  <cit> . a classic approach is to compare trait differences among populations when they are grown in the same environment as in a common garden. comparative genomics studies using natural accessions can also provide insights into traits associated with the adaptation of an organism to a given habitat  <cit> . the genetic basis underlying traits of interest can be studied using the natural genetic variation between accessions combined with standard genetic approaches such as marker based mapping strategies to identify trait-associated allele. however, traits expressed in an environment are the consequence of both genetic and environmental influences  <cit> , so that an adaptation displayed under natural conditions may not be detectable in a controlled environment chamber  <cit> .

eutrema salsugineum  al-shehbaz & warwick  o.e. schulz) offers an ideal system to explore hypotheses about plant adaptations to extreme environments. this native crucifer is closely related to the genetic model plant arabidopsis thaliana but displays a far greater capacity to withstand freezing temperatures, water deficits, and saline soils  <cit> . two naturally occurring accessions have been the subject of several studies with one accession originating from the yukon territory, canada and the second from shandong province, china. these accessions have evolved under contrasting natural habitats with the one in canada growing under a semi-arid, subarctic climate and the accession in china under a temperate climate subject to more frequent precipitation.

yukon eutrema plants show plasticity to field versus controlled environment chambers with respect to morphology, stress-responsive genes and metabolites  <cit> . plants in the field show prominent cauline leaves and, for the most part, lack rosette leaves while plants in cabinets have many rosette but few cauline leaves. at the level of the metabolome, salt-stressed plants in growth chambers accumulate proline in a osmo-responsive manner  <cit> , but plants in a saline field site had a much lower proline content that was comparable to chamber-grown plants that had not been salt stressed. manipulation of salt and nitrogen treatments under controlled growth conditions demonstrated that proline accumulated with high nitrogen content in saline culture media. plants exposed to salt when on low nitrogen accumulated carbohydrates as did plants found under natural conditions  <cit> . thus comparisons involving field and chamber-grown plants can provide novel and valuable insights into the breadth of traits subject to phenotypic plasticity and how they may contribute towards the adaptation of plants to their natural environment.

a limited set of comparisons among transcript profiles of field and chamber-grown yukon eutrema plants was reported by guevara et al.  <cit>  using a microarray chip representing  <dig>  unigenes. they found statistically significant, biologically meaningful gene expression patterns in comparisons between plants stressed under controlled conditions in cabinets and field plants. however, the information that microarray data can provide is limited  <cit> . one issue is poor genome coverage; the chip used surveys a comparatively small sampling of the predicted coding capacity for the full eutrema genome  <cit> . another problem is that microarray data are relative and require incorporation of a control comparison, which may not exist for a field sample. microarrays are also relatively insensitive to distinguishing between genes with multiple family members  <cit>  and this could be further complicated by an indeterminate level of genetic and environmental variation among plants from a natural population in their native habitat. in this investigation we assessed the suitability of an alternative approach to comparative transcriptome profiling based upon next generation sequencing . we used high throughput mrna sequencing technology  that exploits the sensitivity and genome-wide resolving power of ngs platforms. this approach offers a fully quantitative measure of mrna abundance that is particularly suitable for studying organisms where little is known about their transcriptome and a full genome chip is not commercially available  <cit> .

ultimately, the challenge of applying rna-seq technology to plants found in the field is its sensitivity. rna-seq generates large datasets and interpretable patterns from field plants may be difficult to discern given that direct comparisons with plants grown under controlled environment conditions cannot be made. in this study we included natural accessions of eutrema from shandong and the yukon and we compared inbred cabinet-grown yukon and shandong plants and yukon plants sampled in the field. we hypothesized that 1) sequences would differ more between the two accessions, while yukon individuals sampled in the field or raised in cabinets would show far fewer differences. this hypothesis was confirmed by an analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  using transcriptomes of the yukon plants  and shandong plants . we hypothesized that 2) the gene expression results would differ between yukon plants from the field site and growth cabinets, which represent radically different environments. while this prediction held true, the transcriptomes from yukon and shandong plants grown at the same time in the same growth cabinet were also very different emphasizing the important interaction between genotype and environment. we hypothesized that 3) transcriptomes from individual plants selected at random at a yukon field site would be more variable compared to those of individuals selected from the same single-seed descent line and grown together under controlled conditions in growth cabinets. however, this expectation was not borne out. the pattern of gene expression for individual plants of a common genotype that originated from the same environment were similar regardless of where the plants had grown together, showing transcriptomes to be consistent between individual plants of a sample group. while one might anticipate the high sensitivity afforded by ngs to yield transcriptome data that is more difficult to interpret when genetic and environmental variation are uncontrolled variables, our study does not support this hypothesis. instead, we found rna-seq to be a viable approach to compare gene expression patterns of eutrema growing either in controlled environment chambers or in situ in the complex and changeable environment of the yukon.

RESULTS
plant selection and experimental design
nine plants consisting of three individuals from each of three experimental groups were profiled by rna-seq. transcriptomes derived from these plants were expected to display heterogeneity arising from differences between environmental exposure and genotype.

one group consisted of three plants selected in late june of  <dig> from a field site approximately 40Â km nw of whitehorse in the yukon territory of canada. details concerning the soil composition, meteorological conditions and morphology of plants growing at this field site were reported by guevara et al.  <cit> . eutrema plants at this field site have an upright habit with rosette leaves being either very small or absent. for analysis, cauline leaves from randomly selected, individual plants of undetermined age were harvested from the field for transcriptome profiling and these samples are referred to as yf   <dig>  yf <dig>  and yf <dig> 

a second group of three plants of the yukon accession were grown in a controlled environment chamber under daylength conditions set to resemble a yukon summer day . eutrema grown under these laboratory conditions have a prominent rosette  <cit> . rosette leaves of three four week-old plants produced in growth cabinets were selected for transcriptome profiling and these samples are referred to as yc   <dig>  yc <dig>  and yc <dig>  seeds from plants growing at the same yukon field site were pooled and maintained as a bulked collection from which some seeds were used to establish inbred lines. two of the plants in this group, yc <dig> and yc <dig>  were products of single-seed descent from the same parent for five generations while the third, yc <dig>  was grown from a randomly selected seed from the bulked pool.

the third group profiled was composed of three eutrema plants of the shandong accession. plants were subjected to single-seed descent for four generations to increase their genetic homogeneity. sibling shandong eutrema plants from a single-seed descent line were grown in the same cabinet and hence under identical conditions as the yc <dig> and yc <dig> samples. rosette leaves of three four week-old shandong chamber-grown plants were harvested for transcriptome profiling and these samples are referred to as sc   <dig>  sc <dig>  and sc <dig> 

the field plants  and yc <dig> are not products of single-seed descent lines and hence were expected to show greater genetic heterogeneity than the inbred yc <dig> and yc <dig> plants. in terms of comparative genetic variability we expected that the greatest heterogeneity would be found between shandong and yukon plants. thus use of the shandong genotype provided a source of genetic variation and had the additional benefit in facilitating transcriptome assembly through access to its fully sequenced genome as a reference  <cit> .

rna-seq of eutrema samples
massively parallel sequencing of nine cdna libraries generated from eutrema leaf samples of individual plants was conducted on the roche  <dig> gs flx platform. when we began our transcriptome sequencing, a genome assembly for e. salsugineum was not available making the longer read lengths afforded by  <dig> technology advantageous for de novo transcriptome assembly  <cit> . the draft genome releases of the shandong accession of eutrema have since aided our transcriptome assembly, allowing unambiguous association of individual sequence reads with eutrema gene loci. our rna-seq methodology therefore exemplifies a âmapping-firstâ or genome-guided transcriptomics approach  <cit> .

the draft genome of the shandong accession of eutrema released by the joint genome institute , shows the genome to be  <dig> Â mb in size, distributed among  <dig> scaffolds with preliminary annotation available for  <dig>  protein-coding loci  <cit> . the beijing genomics institute  has also released a genome assembly of shandong e. salsugineum, which is 234Â mb in size, distributed among  <dig>  scaffolds. the predicted number of protein-coding genes in this assembly is  <dig>   <cit> . in this report the comparisons or citations to gene annotations, relative positions, and sequences are made with reference to the jgi draft genome release given its earlier availability as a public resource. we have since compared our mapped reads to both genome sequences and found negligible differences in the alignments produced. for example, of the total number of reads obtained from nine cdna libraries, only  <dig> % were aligned to the bgi genome release and not the jgi release.

information concerning cdna library sequencing and read alignments to the jgi draft genome is presented in tableÂ  <dig>  adaptor sequences and regions of poor quality were removed from the raw reads resulting in a total of  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads. the mean read length across all libraries was 282Â bp, and the frequency distribution of read lengths obtained was similar in all sequencing runs .

non-unique reads map to more than one locus in the jgi genome. the last column indicates the proportion of trimmed reads derived from the expression of rrna genes in each library.

trimmed reads derived from each library were aligned against the genome release using open-source gmap software. gmap is a splice-aware aligner that allows mapping of cdna sequences against a reference containing introns and gaps  <cit> . alignments were categorized into three groups consisting of uniquely mapped reads, non-uniquely mapped reads, and unmapped reads that could not be aligned to any locus in the reference and, in view of this difficulty, were not considered further in our analyses . the vast majority of cdna sequences in each library  aligned to a single location in the reference but a small number  mapped to multiple locations. we predicted that many of the non-uniquely aligned cdna reads were expression products of genes with members sharing extensive sequence identity. interestingly, a large fraction of these reads  mapped to a single region on scaffold  <dig> of the jgi release. a custom annotation for this region  shows that it includes a tandem array of five duplicated ribosomal rna gene clusters with  <dig> s, 18s, and 25s rrna genes present in each cluster. the array of rrna genes is a conserved genomic feature that is also present in a similar arrangement on chromosome  <dig> of arabidopsis <cit> . this array of rrna was useful in estimating the level of rrna transcripts contributing to our cdna libraries prepared from polyadenylated mrnas. on average, only  <dig> % of the reads in each library were derived from rrna , indicating that a vast majority of sequences were derived from mrnas.

genomic studies of geographically disparate accessions of arabidopsis thaliana have identified thousands of small genome-wide differences as well as more major genome rearrangements   <cit> . for example, a fraction of the col- <dig> reference genome is absent in the genomes of other accessions  <cit> . in our study, cdna sequences were aligned to the draft genome assembly of the shandong accession. alignments of the shandong-derived sequence reads  were well matched to the reference genome and only a small fraction  of the total reads remained unmatched following alignment . we expected that reads derived from the yukon accession would find less frequent agreement with the draft genome due to polymorphisms between the accessions. however, using this genome-guided rna-seq approach, the libraries derived from cabinet-grown and the naturally occurring yukon eutrema performed as well as the shandong libraries with, on average, only  <dig> % of the total reads from these sources remaining unmatched . this outcome is consistent with a high degree of similarity with respect to gene composition and sequence identity between the genomes of the two accessions.

expression of previously unannotated genes supported by yukon eutrema transcripts
a total of  <dig>  e. salsugineum protein-coding loci were annotated by jgi using transcript evidence from  <dig>  million  <dig> cdna reads . we reasoned that our eutrema libraries comprising over  <dig> million reads would contain transcripts derived from non-abundantly expressed genes or environment-specific genes that have not yet been annotated. we used cufflinks software in a reference-based transcript assembly approach  <cit>  and found read support that enriched the existing complement of annotated genes by  <dig> loci. between jgi and this study, there is transcript support for  <dig>  loci, a number that compares well with  <dig>  predicted genes in the bgi shandong e. salsugineum genome release  <cit>  and  <dig>  protein-coding genes for the closely related eutrema parvulum   <cit> . a summary of these newly annotated genes is presented in additional file  <dig>  a blast analysis of the  <dig> genes indicated that  <dig>  have a match to an arabidopsis thaliana gene and using plant refseq and the e. parvulum databases we matched  <dig> more genes   <cit> . this analysis left  <dig>  genes of the  <dig> genes as unidentified based upon available information. of the  <dig> newly annotated genes, expression associated with  <dig> was only detected in the yukon-genotype transcriptomes of which  <dig> genes were only expressed in plants growing at the yukon field site. thus our rna-seq analysis of the yukon accession that included plants found in the natural environment provided evidence for the expression of a number of genes in regions of the e. salsugineum genome for which transcript support was previously unavailable.

sequence polymorphisms in eutrema accessions
we evaluated the extent of genetic diversity between the two accessions of eutrema and among the yukon laboratory and field plants. for this analysis we used a bioinformatics approach to identify snps and small insertions/deletions  in the rna-seq datafiles of our plant samples compared to the jgi reference genome sequence.

the mpileup function of samtools  <cit>  was used to detect sequence differences within reads that aligned to a unique location in the jgi reference. at each candidate position, gatk  <cit>  software identified snps and indels for each library. this initial set of  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels was then subjected to filters to eliminate the number of differences that might be attributed to sequencing errors. custom perl scripts eliminated snps supported by fewer than five sequence reads across nine libraries and indels with an mpileup quality score less than  <dig>  polymorphisms detected at a frequency supported by less than 1% of informative reads were also excluded from further analysis. the resulting set of high quality polymorphisms comprises  <dig>  two-allele snps  and  <dig>  two-allele indels . we anticipate that future e. salsugineum genome releases will position the current suite of genes onto improved physical maps. with this prospect in mind, we have provided 100Â bp of genomic sequence flanking each polymorphism listed so that they can be more easily located within the present as well as future e. salsugineum genome releases . while these polymorphisms were supported by the sequences of multiple reads, to ensure their accuracy we also subjected a group to testing by q-pcr and high resolution melting  analysis . of  <dig> loci containing accession-specific polymorphisms , hrm only failed to detect one polymorphism in an amplicon associated with a class iv snp . efforts to sequence this locus using traditional sanger sequencing also failed so the status of this single snp was unresolved for technical reasons. thus our computational strategy identified snp and indel polymorphisms accurately enabling us to use the  <dig>  snps to evaluate both the distribution of polymorphisms among genes and the genetic diversity between the eutrema plants used in this study.

high resolution melting  was conducted on genomic dna purified from single, cabinet-grown yukon and shandong plants. position of the polymorphism on the jgi scaffold is indicated as well as its association with a gene locus in the jgi eutrema genome release. only one computationally predicted snp  could not be confirmed by hrm. coverage refers to the number of uniquely mapped sequencing reads aligning to a polymorphism-associated locus in each accession.

the ability to locate snps within individual genes allowed us to identify genes that contain a high number or density of snps. of the  <dig>  snps described,  <dig>  fall within currently unannotated regions of the genome and the remainder  were found within the  <dig>  eutrema genes annotated by jgi and the additional  <dig> genes annotated in this study , yielding an average of  <dig>  snps per gene across all of our transcriptomes. the  <dig> annotated loci exhibiting snp densities in excess of  <dig> snps/kb are presented in additional file  <dig>  loci with anomalously high snp-density could be generated as artifacts through problems in genome assembly and/or improper read alignment of closely related genes to a scaffold position. however, the snp-dense loci on this list are likely genuine given that they are supported by multiple reads and, as discussed below, they encode gene products similar to those identified as highly polymorphic in other studies.

the eutrema orthologue of scar <dig>  has a snp density of  <dig>  snps/kb and it is the locus with the greatest density of snps for which a function of the gene can be surmised. scar <dig> is a gene whose product is implicated in regulating cytoskeletal activities involved in morphogenesis  <cit> . the locus with the highest total number of snps has  <dig> snps distributed among  <dig> exons  and this gene encodes a putative calcium-transporting atpase. in a. lyrata, polymorphism-dense genes encode calcium and magnesium transporters and metal-tolerance proteins that are implicated in this speciesâ ability to grow in soils featuring a low calcium-to-magnesium ratio termed serpentine  <cit> . the soil at the yukon field site where e. salsugineum grows is serpentine  <cit> , suggesting that snp-rich genes like thhalv10012578m.g should be evaluated for a role in the local adaptation of yukon eutrema to its natural habitat.

genes exhibiting high levels of diversity are hypothesized by population theory to contain balanced polymorphisms that can indicate adaptive variation  <cit> . in a study of high-diversity genes differing between the col- <dig> and ler accessions of arabidopsis, cork and purugganan  <cit>  described  <dig> loci of particularly high variation residing within three genomic regions. however, none of the  <dig> most snp-rich eutrema genes  are orthologous to these arabidopsis genes. to gain further insight into the possible biological functions represented by the  <dig> most snp-dense genes, this list was subjected to a gene ontology  analysis to identify categories enriched among these genes compared to the predicted coding capacity of the  <dig>  annotated genes  in the eutrema genome. in this analysis only two categories were over-represented, namely âdefense responseâ  and âresponse to biotic or abiotic stressâ . a blast-based homology analysis against the plant resistance gene database identified  <dig> of the  <dig> most snp-dense loci as putative r genes   <cit> . this is consistent with results of a recent genomic study of multiple arabidopsis accessions noting that r genes were the group of genes exhibiting the greatest level of genetic variability across accessions  <cit>  and r genes are known to be subject to local adaptation  <cit> .

assessment of genetic diversity among eutrema plants
we used the  <dig>  snps to estimate the extent of genetic diversity among the eutrema plants profiled. to increase the confidence of these comparisons we added another filter requiring that a minimum of two reads support a polymorphism between groups. our rationale is that no decision regarding a snp should be supported by a single read from one group of plants due to concerns regarding sequencing errors  <cit> . the number of snps differing between the jgi reference sequence and the sc, yc, and yf groups in all pair-wise comparisons is presented in tableÂ  <dig>  we expected and found the fewest snps between plants of similar genotype. there were  <dig>  snps between the jgi genome sequence and the sc transcriptomes that we profiled and of these,  <dig> snps were unique to this comparison. similarly, only  <dig>  snps were found following a comparison between yc and yf transcriptomes. to provide a context for evaluating whether these types of comparisons represent a significant number of differences, we can compare our results to those of ossowski et al.  <cit>  who re-sequenced the col- <dig> arabidopsis line used in their laboratory and identified  <dig>  snp differences with respect to the tigr version  <dig> col- <dig> genome release. the authors highlighted that a significant fraction  of the col- <dig> specific snps discovered in their genome re-sequencing study could be reasonably attributed to errors in the reference sequence  <cit> .

 <dig>  two-allele snps differentiate the plant groups and the jgi reference genome from each other. some snps were also unique to only one two-way comparison. all snps were identified as variants of the jgi reference so n/a denotes that snps unique to comparisons between transcriptomes could not be identified. for inclusion, snps detected between groups of transcriptomes had to be supported by more than two snps per plant group.

we identified a large number of snps that distinguish the two accessions from each other, with the number found varying between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in different comparisons . a total of  <dig>  were accession-specific snps in that they are associated with only one allele in all four shandong plants  and only one alternative allele in all six yukon plants profiled . there were also  <dig> indels that delineated the shandong accession from the yukon accession . in a related context, gan et al.  <cit>  calculated the number of snps supported by rna-seq reads that differed between the tair  <dig> col- <dig> reference and their genome assemblies for  <dig> arabidopsis accessions as ranging from  <dig>  snps in can- <dig> to  <dig>  snps in po- <dig>  thus the number of snps we identified as differing between the two eutrema accessions in this rna-seq study falls within the number of snps identified as distinguishing various arabidopsis accessions from col- <dig> 

transcriptome profiling of multiple individuals by a reference-guided rna-seq approach provides adequate sequencing depth within coding regions to identify potential errors within the reference genome. the  <dig> shandong-specific polymorphisms mentioned above could be genuine differences between closely related lines but they are also candidate loci that may represent errors in the jgi reference. we made use of the bgi shandong e. salsugineum <cit>  reference genome and determined that, for 45% of the snps differing between the jgi genome release and the sc transcriptomes, the bgi reference sequence was identical to that of our sc transcriptomes. the remaining 55% of snp-associated loci located in the bgi genome were in agreement with the jgi genome release  <cit> . given that these snp-associated loci were supported by multiple sequence reads in each of three shandong plants profiled, these shandong-specific snps merit closer scrutiny as possible errors within the current genome releases.

the shandong plants and two of the cabinet-grown yukon plants  were products of lines subject to a single-seed descent procedure to increase their genetic similarity. the number of snps  distinguishing the sc plants from the jgi reference is consistent with an expectation of high genome sequence similarity . in contrast, the plants at the yukon field site were not subjected to deliberate homogenization strategies so we were surprised to find only  <dig>  snps differing between the transcriptome sequences of cabinet-grown eutrema  and yf plants found growing in a natural yukon habitat . we have no reason to believe that three randomly selected plants from the field site in  <dig> and plants we self-pollinated to create inbred lines in the laboratory beginning in  <dig> share the same pedigree. however, factors conducive for the development of a reproductively isolated and genetically homogenous natural population include the self-fertile nature of this plant and the patchy distribution of salt flats in the yukon.

we used the frequency of snp heterozygosity within individual plants as a means to quantify the extent of genetic variation between the three groups of natural and cabinet-grown eutrema plants. by this criterion, snp heterozygosity ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % within plants in the sc group,  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the yc group and  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the yf group . we believe that these are overestimates of heterozygosity because this metric assumes that each snp is inherited independently. nonetheless these results are similar to estimates of heterozygosity in populations of self-fertile arabidopsis thaliana that average approximately 3% but can range from 1% to as high as 5% in some stands  <cit> . of particular note, the heterozygosity of the yc <dig> individual that was deliberately not subjected to single-seed descent was  <dig> % and thus comparable to estimates for the yukon single-seed descent line  and the natural field plants  . the higher homozygosity within the shandong plants  may reflect a lower rate of outcrossing in the shandong accession in comparison to the yukon. however, the more likely explanation is that the shandong eutrema seeds we received were already inbred and we subjected them to multiple generations of single seed descent.

for each plant, the percentage of snps present as heterozygous alleles compared to the total number of snps was calculated. yf <dig>  yf <dig>  and yf <dig> plants were randomly selected from the field site; yc <dig> was derived from a bulked pool of seeds collected at the field site; sc <dig>  sc <dig>  sc <dig>  yc <dig>  and yc <dig> were derived from single seed descent procedures.

the results shown in tableÂ  <dig> provide an estimate of polymorphic differences between groups and support the conclusion that within-accession genetic variation is low. however, these comparisons reflect the pooled contributions of snps found in three individuals, making it possible that a single plant made a disproportionate contribution towards the estimated genetic heterogeneity. for example, while only  <dig>  snps were identified between yc and yf transcriptomes, it is possible that the majority of those snps were due to differences in a single yf plant and this consideration would lead to a different conclusion about the genetic uniformity of the field plants. to assess the genetic diversity among the individuals within the three groups, we used a subset of snp-associated loci from the  <dig>  snps for which sequence coverage exceeded five reads in each of the three individual plants within a group. in this analysis we determined whether a given snp-associated allele was shared  by other plants within the group. the results of this analysis are shown in the venn diagrams of figureÂ  <dig>  the region of overlap in each of the venn diagrams shows that the vast majority of snps were shared by all three plants within a given group , indicating that the genetic diversity between individuals of a given group is very low. within each group, shandong plants had the fewest alleles associated with unshared snps  while field-grown yukon plants had the most . we found no evidence that a single plant, whether in the field or the cabinet sample groups, had a disproportionate contribution of distinct snp-associated alleles that were not shared by other plants in their respective group.

the genome-wide collection of polymorphisms that differentiate between the yukon and shandong eutrema accessions given in additional file  <dig> can be used to link allele frequency to traits associated with specific environmental conditions. specifically, different accessions of eutrema have been studied with the aim of identifying physiological and biochemical features associated with their adaptations to extreme environmental conditions  <cit> . with respect to the two accessions used in this study, the climate of shandong province is described as temperate and subject to monsoonal rains and that of the yukon as semi-arid and subarctic. thus the two accessions thrive on saline soils under otherwise contrasting environmental conditions, raising the prospect that the plants have common as well as distinct coping strategies to locally adapt to their respective habitats. as has been the case in studies of natural arabidopsis accessions, the availability of snps that differentiate eutrema accessions will facilitate the application of genetic approaches such as the analysis of recombinant inbred lines  or genome-wide association mapping of traits of interest  <cit> .

patterns of global gene expression in eutrema leaves
the number of expressed genes detected in each group was close, ranging from  <dig> , in the yf group to  <dig>  in the yc group . the majority of expressed genes  were expressed in all groups while the proportion of genes that were only detected in a single group was low . the expression levels of all eutrema genes in this study can be visualized using a âeutrema efp browserâ at the bioâ-âanalyticââresourceââ <cit> ââ. the transcript abundance associated with a given gene can be queried using either a eutrema locus identifier  or an arabidopsis locus identifier .

with the majority of genes expressed by all of the plants , we expected that the expression patterns between the transcriptomes from the nine eutrema plants would show considerable overlap. however, we also hypothesized that plants found at the field site would exhibit greater variability in their gene expression patterns relative to plants grown in a controlled environment chamber. to explore sources of variance within the eutrema transcriptomes we used principal component analysis , in which observations were the nine plants and variables were the normalized gene expression estimates for each of  <dig>  eutrema genes. briefly, in pca axes called principal components  are identified. the first pc corresponds to the axis of greatest variation and all pcs, including pc <dig>  describe sources of variation that are uncorrelated to each other. these uncorrelated axes are linear combinations of the original variables and can be used to reveal sources of variance in the data set. the scree plot in figureÂ 3a shows that the first three pcs explain  <dig> % of the total variance in the dataset with pc <dig> contributing  <dig> %, pc <dig>  <dig> %, and pc <dig>  <dig> %.

to interpret the biological significance of the pcs we examined the scores , which are the values of each of the nine plant cdna libraries  . these biplots contain both the scores for the observations and loadings for the variables . this approach allows us to identify genes having expression levels  that are highly positively or negatively correlated with a given pc. the extent of correlation between the expression level of a gene and a pc is indicated by the magnitude of their loadings as shown by the values on the pc axes. pc <dig> explains the majority of variance in the dataset . however, the scores for the nine plants for pc <dig> are similar. expressed genes with high loadings for pc <dig> include thhalv10019202m.g, the eutrema orthologue of at5g <dig>  the locus encoding the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit. not surprisingly, rbcs was the most abundantly expressed gene in every library at an average expression level of  <dig>  reads per kilobase per million mapped reads . in contrast, genes with low loadings for pc <dig> are those showing no or low expression in all plants. taken together, these loading and score patterns suggest that pc <dig> describes transcript abundance irrespective of the plant source. to explore this interpretation, the median expression level across all transcriptome libraries was determined for each of the  <dig>  genes  and then the expression levels were divided into four equal bins based upon their magnitude relative to the median. genes located in each bin were assigned a different gray-scale shade, producing a discrete gray-scale distribution pattern along the pc <dig> axis. genes whose expression was not detected in this study are variables with the lowest loadings for pc <dig> while genes showing increasingly higher expression levels have progressively higher loadings for pc <dig> .

the score and loadings biplot of pc <dig> vs pc <dig> is shown in figureÂ 3d. the scores for the plants within each group cluster together but each group has distinct associations with pc <dig> and pc <dig>  scores for yf plants are positive for both pc <dig> and pc <dig>  sc plants score negatively on pc <dig> and positively on pc <dig>  yc plants cluster around zero on pc <dig> and score negatively on pc <dig>  thus together, pc <dig> and pc <dig> may explain a relatively small fraction of the total variance in the genome-wide expression data  but they capture the majority of variance that distinguishes the plant groups from each other. moreover, the clustering of the three individual plants within each group relative to the pc <dig> and pc <dig> axes  is significant in that it highlights the similarity in overall gene expression shown by individual plants comprising each group. while we expected that intentionally inbred, cabinet-grown plants would show highly correlated patterns of gene expression, we did not anticipate that plants randomly chosen from a field population in the yukon  would be so similar with respect to this property . the leaf transcriptomes obtained from individual plants in a wild population of eutrema were as comparable to each other as those obtained from plants grown under protocols designed to control genetic and environmental variability and optimize reproducibility.

in contrast to pc <dig>  the biological interpretation of the pc <dig> and pc <dig> axes is more complex given the large number of genes expressed, the low factor loadings associated with the majority of these genes and the fact that relatively few genes are strongly associated with pc <dig> and/or pc <dig>  to address this challenge we used a variety of approaches to infer the biological meaning of pc <dig> and pc <dig>  thus we identified differentially expressed genes  and used this information to group sc, yc, and yf plants on the basis of similar and contrasting patterns of gene expression. we also plotted the pc scores as norms of reaction plots and the degs as heat maps to facilitate comparisons between the transcriptomes and help identify and interpret patterns associated with the pcs and expressed genes. finally, we categorized degs using go slim terms in order to associate the gene products with putative biological functions.

accession- and location-associated patterns of gene expression in eutrema
our biological interpretation of the significance of pc <dig> and pc <dig> comes, in part, from examining the class of genes that were only found to be expressed in a single group of plants . loadings for these genes are highly correlated with the scores for each of the yf, yc, and sc plant groups. with transcriptomes obtained from individual eutrema plants within each group being similar, we expected that meaningful patterns could be discriminated among the degs. we used deseq  <cit>  to identify degs in pairwise comparisons between the three groups of plants with the three transcriptomes of plants within each group treated as biological replicates. gene expression estimates for all degs in each plant as well as their patterns of differential regulation are presented in the three tabs of additional file  <dig> 

a total of  <dig>  genes, or only  <dig> % of the annotated eutrema genome, were identified as differentially expressed . the largest number of degs observed was between sc and yf transcriptomes , a comparison involving genotype and location . the number of genes differentially expressed between plant groups varying by genotype only was less than half  of the number distinguishing the plant groups that varied with respect to location but not genotype .

the degs presented in figureÂ  <dig> are sorted into  <dig> distinct categories according to the significance of differential gene expression between the three groups of plants. for instance in category  <dig>  expression of  <dig> genes was significantly higher in sc plants than in yf plants but expression of these genes was not significantly different between sc and yc or between yc and yf.

the  <dig>  degs were assigned to one of  <dig> non-overlapping categories following pair-wise comparisons between the plant groups . most of the genes showed a statistically significant expression difference from a single, pair-wise comparison between two of three plant groups . the second most frequent scenario was genes whose differential regulation proved significant in two pair-wise comparisons . a third, smaller set of genes , had transcript expression levels for each of the plant groups that were significantly different from each other .

our pca analysis shown in figureÂ 3d indicated that pc <dig> and pc <dig> best described the sources of variance between the three plant groups. in figureÂ 4b-d the pc <dig> versus pc <dig> biplots are redrawn with genes highlighted using colored symbols representing their deg categories . the degs shown on the biplots are not randomly distributed in that symbols relating to the different categories are grouped in discrete zones around the origin. this organization is best exemplified by the zonation seen in figureÂ 4c, showing the degs of categories  <dig> through  <dig>  the up-regulated genes of yf relative to both sc and yc  have positive loadings on both pc <dig> and pc <dig> axes. in contrast, the down-regulated genes of yf relative to the other samples  have negative loadings for both pc <dig> and pc <dig>  this arrangement of degs around the origin is recapitulated for the remaining categories . categories  <dig> and  <dig> describe genes that are differentially regulated in yc plants relative to both sc and yf plants and their loadings are associated primarily with pc <dig> and negligibly with pc <dig>  figureÂ 3d reiterates the association between yc and pc <dig> in that genes expressed only in yc plants and genes more highly expressed in yc <dig>  yc <dig>  and yc <dig> plants are all strongly associated with pc <dig> 

analogous observations provide insight into the variance associated with pc <dig>  in categories  <dig>  and  <dig> , degs are defined by significant expression differences between yf and sc plants. in figureÂ 4d , yf and sc transcript expression is significantly different whereas the expression level for genes in yc plants is intermediate between yf and sc plants. in both of the above instances pc <dig> explains a source of variance in gene expression between the sc  and yf  transcriptomes that is not influenced by yc transcriptomes. conversely, pc <dig> explains a source of variation uncorrelated to pc <dig> that describes differences in gene expression in yc plants. both the zonation of degs around the origin of pc <dig> and pc <dig>  and the distribution of the scores, including their correlation within plant groups, emphasizes that pc <dig> and pc <dig> capture the main sources of variance between the plant groups despite their minor contribution  to the total amount of variance in the dataset.

the associations between pc scores and transcriptome source can also be displayed as norm of reaction plots , with measures for the yukon plants in growth cabinet and yukon field, and measures for shandong plants in growth cabinet. the plot of pc <dig> scores  shows no variability among the nine genome-wide transcription profiles tested. this demonstrates the lack of genetic variability between accessions or in response to the environment between transcriptomes with respect to pc <dig>  in contrast, plots of pc <dig> and pc <dig> scores show differences in transcriptome patterns between the plants within the cabinet indicating genetic differentiation, between accessions and between the yukon plants grown in the field and yukon plants grown in the cabinet, indicating phenotypic plasticity. for pc <dig>  sc and yf scores were the most different with yc scores intermediate of sc and yf. pc <dig> scores from transcriptome profiles of sc and yc plants grown under common cabinet conditions are significantly different, indicating the two accessions differ genetically in the gene expression patterns contributing to pc <dig>  however, pc <dig> scores also differ in global transcription patterns between yc and yf samples indicating that yukon plants show plasticity in gene expression associated with pc <dig> in response to the environment. interestingly, for pc <dig> the sc and yf scores are the same but yc and yf scores are significantly different, as are those for sc and yc. thus pc <dig>  like pc <dig>  shows genetics as a source of variation between sc and yc transcriptomes, but many expressed genes with high loadings on pc <dig> do not differ between sc and yf samples. additional file  <dig> is a list of the  <dig> expressed genes with the greatest loadings contributing to the negative position of yc scores relative to yf and sc scores for pc <dig>  a common attribute of genes on this list is that they show comparatively higher average transcript levels for yc samples relative to the low  detected expression for the same genes in yf and sc samples.

phenotypic plasticity has been reported for yukon field and cabinet plants with field plants largely void of rosette leaves and cabinet plants rarely having cauline leaves  <cit> . this morphological difference between field and cabinet phenotypes precludes selective sampling of either cauline or rosette leaves from both sources. thus the differences seen between yc and yf gene expression shown by pc <dig> could arise from developmental differences between cauline leaves of field plants and rosette leaves of cabinet-grown plants. to address this possibility, we prepared a transcriptome from cauline leaves of flowering bolts removed from cabinet grown yukon plants. this sample was equivalent to the cabinet cauline leaf cdna used as a control in comparisons with field samples for the microarray study reported by guevara et al.  <cit> . additional file  <dig> includes a column with transcript levels found for yc cauline leaves for comparison to the yc and yf expression values. for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes on this list, the transcript data shows that yc rosette and cauline leaves from cabinets share the same pattern of higher gene expression relative to yf and sc samples. this observation supports the proposal that pc <dig> describes variation in gene expression of yukon leaves of cabinet-grown plants  and that these genes are not co-expressed to nearly the same extent in leaves of sc plants in the same cabinet or yukon plants in the field. the biological significance of the genes comprising this list is difficult to determine as many have either a poorly defined role in plants or no known biological function.

pca of the entire expression dataset, comprised of  <dig>  genes in all nine samples, demonstrated that transcriptome profiles of the naturally occurring yukon plants were as similar to each other and as reproducible as the profiles of the chamber-grown plants . using the smaller subset of transcriptionally variable genes we assessed the extent of variability in deg expression among plants within and between sample groups. we anticipated that more irregularities in the expression of degs might be observed in the field-grown plants compared to the plants grown in controlled conditions. expression estimates for each of the  <dig>  degs within the nine libraries were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis  to visualize their expression patterns within and between groups.

the dendrogram at the top of the heat map shown in figureÂ  <dig> groups together the datasets obtained from replicate plants with the expression profiles from cabinet-grown plants  sharing the same node. the hca shows that the sample group clustering separately from the sc and yc plants is the yf group, indicating that there are fewer correlations between the transcript abundance of degs in cabinet and field-grown plants than between the cabinet-grown plants of the two accessions . this interpretation is also supported by our observation that a greater number of genes were identified as differentially expressed when yc and yf transcriptomes were compared  versus the sc and yc transcriptome comparison  .

the heat map of figureÂ  <dig> also includes âtracesâ indicating the normalized, log transformed expression level associated with each deg. the traces show discernible differences in gene expression between the three groups of plants but they produce a nearly identical pattern within each of the groups. the heat map provides a visual means to demonstrate that expression of degs was very consistent within each group of three plants. thus while the plants at the field site may show a pattern of gene expression that distinguishes them in a cluster apart from the cabinet-grown plants, the traces associated with degs from the yf sample group show an internally consistent pattern of expression despite having been selected randomly from a single natural site in their native yukon habitat. as discussed earlier, the yukon field and cabinet plants show plasticity with respect to predominance of cauline and rosette leaves, respectively, so the array of differentially expressed genes between field and cabinet yukon plants could represent differences between leaf type. additional file 1: figure s <dig> is a version of the hca shown in figureÂ  <dig> that has been modified to include the cabinet-derived yukon cauline leaf expression data corresponding to the  <dig>  degs distinguishing the sc, yc, and yf transcriptomes from each other. the gene expression data associated with the cauline leaves from yukon cabinet-grown plants are grouped in the same clade with the yc rosette leaves and apart from the cauline leaves of yf plants or rosette leaves of sc samples. this outcome is consistent with the results of ma et al.  <cit>  who used microarrays to compare expressed genes representing various organs of arabidopsis. they show that cauline and rosette leaves collected from plants of varying age but grown under identical conditions of temperature, light intensity and duration have similar expression profiles with their corresponding datasets sharing the same clade as determined by average-linkage clustering with correlation distance analysis of relatedness. thus we conclude that the pattern of degs given in figureÂ  <dig> represent differences attributable to variable genotype and/or environment and not different leaf types from plants of the same accession grown under comparable environmental conditions.

biological significance of differentially expressed genes in eutrema
using the extensive similarity between arabidopsis and eutrema genes we examined the predicted biological functions represented by the  <dig>  genes identified as differentially expressed in comparisons between sc, yc, and yf sample groups using a go analysis. in the first approach we identified a number of go slim categories that were significantly over- or under- represented in comparisons made between the sample groups . for reference we also determined the predicted frequency of gene products in a given go category using the entire eutrema genome . the result of this go analysis shows that a broad array of biological process  and molecular function  associated products are represented by the degs identified through our pair-wise comparisons. only two go slim terms in the ontology domain relating to biological process showed a significant over-representation of genes for all three pair-wise comparisons  relative to the whole genome and these were âresponse to stressâ and âresponse to abiotic or biotic stimulusâ .

we next identified go terms that were over-represented by the degs. using a cutoff of q â¤  <dig> , there were  <dig> and  <dig> go terms describing degs between sc versus yc and yc versus yf transcript comparisons, respectively. the go terms showing a high degree  of over-representation are shown in tableÂ  <dig> and again the term âresponse to stressâ is common to both comparisons. for plants representing the two accessions growing under identical conditions, namely sc and yc plants, degs associated with the go term âdefense responseâ were the most highly over-represented group. in contrast, for the comparison involving the same accession in different environments  the go term that was most significantly enriched by degs was âphotosynthesisâ.

go terms that are significantly enriched are presented. q values show the level of significance for each comparison within the indicated plant groups.

go classifications offer a means to explore transcriptome data and it can provide insight into the functional significance of a gene or group of genes. we have no evidence that the cabinet-grown plants  were exposed to pathogens so the biological significance of the gene products associated with the shared go term âdefense responseâ is difficult to evaluate. on the other hand, the go term âphotosynthesisâ is not an unexpected category to find differentially expressed genes given the dissimilar light conditions between the yukon field site and the cabinet. indeed, a key difference between the environment experienced by the yf and yc or sc plants was light intensity, measured as  <dig> Î¼mol mâ2Â sâ <dig> at mid-day at the field site when plants were collected  <cit>  and a constant  <dig> Î¼mol m-2Â s- <dig> for a 21Â hÂ day in the growth chamber. given this almost six-fold difference in irradiance, it is not surprising that âphotosynthesisâ was the most over-represented go term in the comparison between field-grown and cabinet-grown yukon plants, and the most statistically significant category in the entire go dataset.

of  <dig> eutrema genes that were found to be associated with the go term âphotosynthesisâ ,  <dig> show significant differences following pair-wise comparisons between sc, yc, and yf plants . if we confine our discussion to differences involving the yc and yf plants, there are only  <dig> genes relevant to this comparison. interestingly, in every case the transcript abundance associated with yf plants exceeds that of yc plants  with the greatest fold change  found for a gene identified as ferric reduction oxidase  <dig> ; a representative from the small number of degs comprising the yfâ>âscâ>âyc category of tableÂ  <dig>  predictably, genes whose products have a longstanding association to photosynthesis are on this supplementary list  including the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase , the delta subunit  and gamma subunit  of the chloroplast atp synthase and various light harvesting pigment proteins . interestingly, the genes whose transcripts consistently show an approximately three-fold or higher level of expression in the field relative to the cabinet encode many products associated with the chloroplast nadh complex , involved in photosystem  <dig>  photosynthetic cyclic electron transport and chlororespiration . these products include ndh subunits ndf2/ndh <dig> , ndf <dig> , ndf <dig> , ppl <dig> , chlororespiratory reduction  <dig> , crr <dig>  and crr <dig> . the ndh associates with psi in an interaction that is believed to involve lhcl  subunits lhca <dig> and lhca <dig>  encoded by orthologues of at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the genes associated with these minor components of psi both show statistically significantly higher transcript levels in field plants relative to chamber grown plants . psbq and psbp proteins are also regarded as integral to ndh complex accumulation and transcripts associated with these products are also up-regulated in the field. a hypothesis consistent with these observed differences in transcript abundance is that the field plants have a heightened capacity for psi cyclic electron transport that uses a chloroplast ndh-dependent route. the ndh complex represents one route for cyclic electron transfer around psi in arabidopsis. there is evidence that the ndh complex exerts its main effects under stress where it is believed to prevent the over-reduction of psi electron acceptors, reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species and, in general, provide protection from photoinhibition . statistically significant associations between stress and degs were reiterated in comparisons between yf and yc transcriptomes in the âresponse to stressâ and âresponse to abiotic stimulusâ categories . the stress-responsive differences supported through go analyses are all the more convincing given the changeable and stressful conditions at the field site compared to the growth chambers  <cit> .

light intensity at the field site can be variable but a far more consistent natural feature of the yukon habitat where eutrema grows is the presence of a highly saline soil. we previously reported that both the soil and eutrema leaf tissue obtained from the field site contain high levels of na+ <cit>  and the turgid leaves exhibited low solute potentials consistent with plants having undergone osmotic adjustment  <cit> . we therefore expected that go terms concerned with responses to salt exposure would also emerge as statistically significant when characterizing the transcriptional difference between the field-grown plants and unsalinized cabinet-grown plants. in support of this expectation, we identified  <dig> eutrema gene orthologues participating in the âresponse to salt stressâ  category . however, this category was not identified as a statistically significant difference in any of the comparisons between plant groups. of the  <dig> genes with some salt association, only  <dig>  were differentially regulated in the comparison between yf and yc transcriptomes . thus only a small number of genes classically categorized as salt responsive were differentially regulated in yukon plants exposed to a saline environment in the field. while this outcome may be surprising, it is entirely consistent with microarray experiments showing a smaller transcriptional change in eutrema plants exposed to salt compared to other stresses  <cit> . it is possible that the actions of a few genes may orchestrate a large effect but, equally, it has been proposed that eutrema genes required for salinity tolerance are constitutively expressed in this plant which is adapted to saline soil conditions  <cit>  and therefore salt-responsive genes are not detected as degs. regardless of the explanation, in contrast to the salt-inducible nature of many genes in arabidopsis, the response of eutrema to salt is associated with the altered expression of relatively few genes as determined by both microarray and rna-seq approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
due to its natural adaptations to harsh environments, eutrema salsugineum has emerged as an important model for deciphering mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance in plants  <cit> . one methodology employed by our group as well as others has been phenotypic, physiological and gene expression profiling of eutrema in response to simulated stress treatments in growth cabinets  <cit> . experiments of this type offer certain advantages, including the ability to select or manipulate the genotype of the plants studied, apply stress treatments in a prescribed manner and replicate experiments under tightly controlled environment conditions. however, recent reviews have highlighted weaknesses in this approach, namely that growth chambers do not reproduce the complexity and dynamic nature of a natural environment  <cit> . nonetheless, natural environments are precisely the conditions in which traits conferring stress tolerance must manifest themselves. the unexpectedly low content of the osmoprotectant proline in leaves of field plants was discussed earlier as one such anomalous response between field plants on saline soil and cabinet plants irrigated with salt  <cit> . with these considerations in mind, perhaps it is not surprising that few genes identified as key candidates for abiotic stress improvements as a result of growth cabinet studies have been used successfully to improve stress tolerance under actual field conditions  <cit> .

in this study we sought to determine whether the sensitivity and capacity for genome-wide resolution in gene expression offered by rna-seq approaches could be satisfactorily deployed in the investigation of a native plant exposed to stressful conditions in its natural environment. for this approach we had to consider the possible influence of natural genetic and environmental variation on gene expression that could interfere with, or even prevent, the detection of traits of interest. this concern has received little attention in the literature. existing gene expression profiling of plants growing in field plots  <cit>  or in a natural habitat  <cit>  has reflected the pooled contribution of multiple individuals, thereby masking the extent of natural variation that is actually present. our results show little evidence for genetic diversity among the natural plants sampled in the yukon, thereby ruling out genetic variation as a major source of transcriptional variation in these plants. furthermore, rna-seq transcriptomes obtained from three, individual plants randomly selected at the field site were as similar to each other as those obtained from intentionally inbred chamber-grown plants, demonstrating that natural environmental variation did not impede the identification of genes showing similar patterns of expression. this agreement is particularly striking given the extent of phenotypic plasticity displayed by this species but perhaps not surprising in light of recent evidence that eutrema has a core set of platform independent traits in addition to those showing plasticity  <cit> . moreover we show, using a yukon population of eutrema, that a physiologically relevant record of exposure to a natural habitat can be captured and retrieved from the transcriptomes of relatively few individual plants. this rna-seq data is publicly available and can be queried using the bar efp browser, which will facilitate the study of environment- or accession-associated differences in gene expression. gene expression profiles from an extremophile plant in its natural habitat provide an invaluable platform from which sophisticated data mining followed by physiological and genetic approaches can be used to identify and test the adaptive significance of plant stress responses.
