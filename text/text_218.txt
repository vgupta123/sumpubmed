BACKGROUND
monogastric mammals, which include humans, depend on external dietary sources for half of the amino acids needed for protein synthesis. the aspartate-family pathway controls synthesis of the essential amino acids lysine, threonine, and methionine, with lysine feedback-inhibition and rates of lysine degradation being factors in this important pathway. among the essential amino acids, lysine is the most severely limiting in the cereals - crops that make up half of the human diet  <cit> . in contrast to animals, plants synthesize lysine and have evolved complex metabolic pathways to maintain lysine levels  <cit> . to understand lysine metabolism, a thorough understanding of all aspects of these pathways is necessary. for the catabolic portion of lysine metabolism, the bifunctional enzyme lysine ketoglutarate reductase saccharopine dehydrogenase  converts lysine to glutamate and α-aminoadipic acid via a 2-step pathway; i.e., the lkr activity  catalyzes the formation of saccharopine from lysine and α-ketoglutarate , and the sdh activity  processes the saccharopine into glutamate and an α-aminoadipic-δ-semialdehehyde which is further catabolized to two glutamates  <cit> . in both plants and animals, the lkr/sdh gene encodes an open reading frame composed of fused lkr and sdh domains - compared to yeast and fungi where the lkr and sdh activities are encoded by separate genes  <cit> . in plant lkr/sdh genes, there is a linker, or interdomain, sequence not present in animals that separates the lkr and sdh encoding domains - leading to speculation that there are controls and functions unique to plants  <cit> . both lkr/sdh and monofunctional sdh mrnas have been detected in mouse  <cit> . similarly in plants, an arabidopsis sdh mrna is reported that initiates transcription inside the 3' sequence of the interdomain  <cit> , and a cotton lkr mrna is reported that terminates at the 5' junction area of the linker  <cit> . one question in the latter report was that the 3' noncoding sequence is not present in the lkr/sdh gene - leaving the origin of this sequence uncertain but attributed to a possible trans-splicing event. the function of such mono-functional mrnas is not clear, but the sdh mrna and protein levels were consistently higher than the lkr/sdh mrna and protein levels in arabidopsis tissues - leading to the proposal that the lkr activity was the rate limiting step and that the relative sdh excess assured rapid flux through the pathway for lkr/sdh  <cit> .

the exact site of activity of lkr/sdh is considered to be the mitochondria  <cit> , but evidence is not clear. the lkr/sdh enzyme has been localized to the cytosol in plants  <cit> , while lysine-α-ketoglutarate reductase and saccharopine dehydrogenase enzymatic activities were located only in the mitochondrial matrix in animal livers  <cit> . possible roles in transcription regulation include evidence of lkr/sdh being a co-factor involved in hormone-mediated transcription through regulation of h <dig> and h <dig> histone methylation  <cit>  and the lkr/sdh gene is reported to be regulated by the opaque2-type transcription factors that also control the expression of at least some classes of cereal seed proteins  <cit> . in addition to a direct role in lysine metabolism, lkr/sdh has been reported to be regulated by a number of environmental and metabolic influences including osmotic balance, hormome levels, and salt and water stresses  <cit> . suggestive evidence for more complex regulatory roles for lkr/sdh are that expression is enhanced in developing seeds of cereals and floral tissues known to contain limited amounts of lysine, and analyses suggesting lkr/sdh expression is not highly coordinated with other catabolic enzymes  <cit> . similarly, the finding of multiple transcripts from the same gene  and a coding region composed of  <dig> exons in a dicot and  <dig> exons in a monocot  <cit>  suggests complex regulation and roles in plant metabolism and development  <cit> .

the importance of lysine to animal/human nutrition and the role of lkr/sdh in lysine catabolism has lead to several approaches to increase plant seed lysine. these approaches include increasing seed lysine by transformation with feedback-insenstive versions of lysine anabolic genes  <cit> , down-regulating the lkr/sdh gene  <cit> , a combination of those two approaches  <cit> , transgenic expression of a foreign protein high in lysine  <cit> , and reducing synthesis of lysine-poor seed proteins  <cit> .

plant lkr/sdh genomic sequences have been formally reported only for arabidopsis  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . a comparison of these dicot and monocot genes found high conservation in exon size and sequence, with the maize gene having one additional exon in the 5' region  <cit> . the dicot and moncot intron sequences have diverged completely and the maize introns are generally larger - from start to stop codons the maize lkr/sdh gene spans  <dig> bp while the arabidopsis gene spans  <dig> bp. additional plant lkr/sdh sequences are available , but have not been comparatively analyzed. the triticeae crops  are, as a group, the largest direct fraction of the human diet worldwide, but no lkr/sdh gene has been reported for this important crop group.

the current report describes a bac clone of a wheat genomic fragment containing an lkr/sdh gene, determines genome assignments of the bac and est contigs in hexaploid wheat, and compares relative homoeologue expression among the three hexaploid wheat genomes. also described are a comparative analysis of a set of plant lkr/sdh genes including variant structures in the poplar and grape genomes. wheat and other plant lkr/sdh ests are analyzed to determine splicing sites and evidence for alternative splicing. this analysis also finds est evidence for both monofunctional lkr and sdh transcripts.

RESULTS
wheat lkr genomic region
to isolate a wheat lkr/sdh gene, a durum wheat  tetraploid 5× bac library was screened. six bacs were positive for lkr/sdh sequences and formed two contigs of four and two bacs respectively, as seen from southern analysis and bac fingerprinting . each contig contained single lkr/sdh sequences - suggesting that there are single lkr/sdh genes in each of the wheat a and b genomes of tetraploid wheat. bac 0006m <dig> was chosen for sequencing as having the lkr/sdh gene relatively centrally located in the bac. this bac was sequenced and found to be  <dig>  bp in length. the sequence can be found as genbank accession gu <dig> 

the annotation of this region of the wheat genome found three known genes and one unknown gene as shown in figure 1a; i.e., genes for a pectinesterase , a mitochondrial termination factor , lkr/sdh, and an unknown gene. these four genes are clustered within about  <dig>  bp composed of two pairs of gene sequences  and non-coding and non-repetitive sequences  that include gene promoters. these two gene pairs are separated by a short region of transposable elements. the remainder of the  <dig>  bp bac sequence is composed of nested transposable elements of various classes . this organization is consistent with previous reports that the wheat genome is composed of small "islands" of 1- <dig> genes separated by regions of transposable elements  <cit> .

structure of the a wheat lkr/sdh gene and protein
analysis of the wheat lkr/sdh gene sequence indicates the structure shown in figure 1b. consensus exon/intron boundaries were determined using wheat est sequences aligned to the genomic sequence. at least one wheat est exists that overlaps all the coding sequence except for the region around exon  <dig> where maize and rice lkr/sdh coding sequences were used to estimate exon/intron boundaries. in regions with only 1- <dig> wheat ests, exon/intron boundaries matched rice and maize sequences in all cases. similar to the previously reported maize lkr/sdh gene structure  <cit> , the wheat lkr/sdh gene is comprised of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. the intron borders matched the canonical plant intron borders  for all  <dig> introns. the 5' portion of the sequence encodes the lkr activity of the bifunctional enzyme, which is encoded by eleven exons ; the 3' part of the sequence encodes for sdh activity and contains twelve exons . the two regions are separated by an interdomain region composed of two exons  and three introns, one of which  is the longest intron in the lkr/sdh gene . this intron may include 5'-utr/promoter sequences for monofunctional sdh transcripts .

the coding sequence from the wheat lkr/sdh gene is used to derive the complete bifunctional amino acid sequence and is shown in figure  <dig> along with indications of exon boundaries . a similar analysis was carried out for available sequences from brachypodium, cotton, grape, medicago, poplar, and rice. these seven sequences are compared to the previously reported sequences from arabidopsis and maize and the nine derived amino acid sequences are aligned in figure  <dig>  highlighted are conserved amino acid positions  on all analyzed plants  and positions unique to monocots . exon/introns positions are conserved among all plants analyzed with an exception that exons  <dig> and  <dig> in monocots form a single exon in dicots as previously noted  <cit> . exons are indicated for the monocots . although much of the sequence is conserved among all plants, several portions are not and are characterized by both residue differences and sequence length variation. examples of major differences between monocots and dicots include the beginning of exon  <dig>  the junctions of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig>  the exons  <dig> and  <dig> junction where differences in transcription termination suggest monofunctional lkr transcripts . exons  <dig> and  <dig> are in the central portion of the lkr and sdh domains, respectively. exon  <dig> is both at the beginning of the sdh domain and one of the largest exons. exon  <dig> is one of the most conserved exons, but is part of the interdomain region and not the lkr and sdh enzymatic domains, suggesting conservation of function not yet understood. the wheat lkr/sdh polypeptide is similar in length to the other grass polypeptides except at positions starting at  <dig> and  <dig> in exon  <dig> of figure  <dig> - the wheat sequence is three and ten amino acid residues shorter than in the other grasses, respectively. the functional significance of such differences is not known, but may relate to regions of limited functional significance.

as suggested by the blue shading in the amino acid alignment, the lkr/sdh amino acid sequences from dicots and monocots form two distinct branches on phylogenetic analysis as shown more clearly in figure  <dig>  a pair-wise distance table is given in additional file  <dig>  the closest related sequence to wheat is from brachypodium, consistent with previous reports from bac-end sequence analyses  <cit>  and from taxonomic placement of brachypodium in the brachypodieae tribe sibling to the triticeae tribe  - both tribes are members of the pooideae subfamily . the tree in figure  <dig> also shows that the only two previously described lkr/sdh sequences, from arabidopsis and maize , are each most distantly related to the other plant proteins within their respective groups.

the coding regions of available lkr/sdh genes were also compared and formed a phylogenetic tree of the same form as in figure  <dig> . a comparison of intron sequences found no significant conservation of intron sequences for available lkr/sdh sequences within both dicots and monocots - with the exception of the brachypodium/wheat comparison where significant conservation is evident . further sequencing of lkr/sdh, and other genes from a larger panel of more closely related plant genera and species is needed to understand patterns of plant intron sequence divergence.

chromosome and genome location of the wheat lkr/sdh gene
southern analysis of hexaploid wheat found that wheat est be <dig> hybridized to three genomic fragments  <cit> http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/west. two of the lkr/sdh-encoding fragments were mapped to the 6al and 6bl chromosome arms but a third fragment could not be accurately mapped or assignment made to the 6dl chromosome . the same analysis localized the gene to the region of  <dig>  to  <dig>  of the wheat consensus group  <dig> chromosome long arm. the wheat group  <dig> chromosomes have most homology to rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  - consistent with the wheat lkr/sdh gene on the group  <dig> chromosomes since the rice lkr/sdh gene sequence is found on rice chromosome  <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

the wheat lkr/sdh gene sequence of bac 0006m <dig> was compared to rice and conserved primers were designed and used to amplify dna from diploid ancestors of the hexaploid wheat  and tetraploid wheats . amplified fragments were sequenced and used to design a-, b-, and d-genome specific primers . genome-specific primer pairs are shown to amplify from specific genomes using three wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic genetic stocks - each stock missing one of the three group  <dig> wheat chromosomes . these genome-specific primer pairs were used to determine the genome origin of the wheat bac 0006m <dig>  results showed that primer pair af <dig>  and r <dig>  amplified the expected fragment size from bac 0006m <dig> and dnas containing the a-genome , but not from dna missing the a-genome  - establishing that bac 0006m <dig> originated from the wheat a-genome .

the previous results supported lkr/sdh genes exist in each of the hexaploid wheat's a-, b-, and d-genomes. to determine if all three genes were actively transcribed, wheat lkr/sdh ests were identified . these ests assembled into three contigs, one of which  is identical over its  <dig> bp to the sequenced bac lkr/sdh coding region . the relationship of the three contigs to the same region in the bac sequence is shown in additional file  <dig>  contig  <dig> also contains all five t. monococcum  lkr/sdh ests, therefore confirming contig  <dig> and the bac as originating from the a-genome. contigs  <dig> and  <dig> contain, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> ests from tetraploid wheats . contig  <dig> contains no tetraploid or t. monococcum ests. therefore, contig  <dig> should represent the b-genome and contig  <dig> the d-genome. in support of these assignments, the sequences of contigs  <dig> and  <dig> are closer to each other than to contig  <dig> , consistent with the previous reports that the a and d common ancestor diverged from the b-genome ancestor  <cit> . finally, the sequences amplified from specific genomes matched the three contigs and confirmed the genome assignments .

when the ests for the three hexaploid wheat lkr/sdh est contigs are tallied, the distribution by genome for the a-, b-, and d-genomes is  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ests, respectively. a chi-square goodness-of-fit test for departure from expected values yields p =  <dig> . thus, the number of ests from the three homoeologs is not considered statistically significantly different from the expected numbers. further, more global, analyses are needed to understand whether differential homoeologue transcription has a role in polyploid plants.

structure and expression of genes adjacent to the lkr/sdh locus
three other genes are found near the lkr/sdh gene in this study . the first gene is for a pectinesterase . this class of enzymes catalyses the demethylesterification of cell wall polygalacturonans and produces de-esterified acidic pectins and methanol  <cit> . the plant pectinesterases comprise a large family of enzymes with roles in a wide range of plant cell activities including cell adhesion, cell elongation, organelle formation, ribosome binding, and plant defense  <cit> . the pectinesterase gene in bac 0006m <dig> contains one intron of  <dig> bp . no ests are found that exactly match the bac a-genome pectinesterase gene, but additional file  <dig> shows four similar wheat ests  with 93-96% sequences matches to the bac pectinesterase gene. these four ests are likely from one of the orthologous pe genes in either the b- or d-genomes. in addition, the best blastn match of these ests and the bac pe sequence is to the rice pectinesterase gene adjacent to the lkr/sdh gene in the rice genome .

the second additional gene encodes a mitochondrial termination factor . these genes encode a protein family involved in the transcriptional regulation of the mitochondrial genome. mitochondrial dna is transcribed as polycistrons that include rna for rrna, trna, and mrnas. a preponderance of rrnas is achieved by mterfs promoting transcription termination at the 3' end of the rrna region  <cit>  and pausing transcription at other sites in the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . an mterf gene is found in the bac sequence between the pectinesterase and lkr/sdh genes at about  <dig>  bp . the gene contains no introns and has an intact mterf reading frame that encodes a mterf highly similar to mterf proteins reported for other plants - an amino acid alignment is shown in additional file  <dig> for rice and maize. the wheat bac mterf gene is also expressed since several good matches to wheat ests exist  including wheat ests be <dig> and fl <dig> which are exact matches over their  <dig> and  <dig> bp lengths, respectively, and are therefore assigned to the a-genome. wheat ests bq <dig> and al <dig> have dna sequences that are 94% matching the wheat a-genome lkr/sdh sequence, and are likely from the b- and/or d-genome orthologous genes. a single barley est is also a 94% dna sequence match to the wheat a-genome lkr/sdh coding sequence. the best rice genomic similarity to the bac mterf and matching ests is to an mterf gene adjacent to the rice lkr/sdh gene.

finally, immediately 3' to the lkr/sdh gene is an apparent gene of unknown function. similar genomic or est sequences are found only in the triticeae, but a unique  <dig> out of  <dig> bp sequence is found in the same relative position 3' to the lkr/sdh gene in rice. although no wheat ests exactly match this unknown gene, a similar region is apparently transcribed in barley since two barley ests  are close matches . the alignment of the two barley ests to the wheat genomic region shows seven gaps with canonical intro/exon junctions at  <dig> of  <dig> positions. when the apparent exons are spliced together and the resulting dna and derived amino acid sequences are used as queries in database searches, no significant match is found to any dna  or protein sequences . the two barley ests are from pistil and embryo sac, respectively. these two tissues have not been commonly sampled for ests - which could account for the sequence not appearing in other plant est collections. if this sequence is found only in triticeae, then the sequence must have arisen after separation of the triticeae from other grasses. thus, although the intron/exon structure and ests argue for a functional gene, this remains to be further established.

comparison to other genomes
in addition to comparing the lkr/sdh derived protein sequences , the region of the wheat genome represented within bac 0006m <dig> was compared to other available plant genomic sequences, either from complete genomes in the cases of arabidopsis, brachypodium, medicago, rice, and sorghum, or from bac sequences containing lkr sequences and some flanking dna as in the cases of grape and poplar . in seven of the eight species, the data supports a single lkr/sdh gene per genome. the exception was for poplar, where poplar bac ac <dig>  contains two full-length copies of the lkr/sdh gene plus a third gene encoding only the lkr portion with a 5' lkr sequence truncation at the end of the bac sequence. in contrast, searching the poplar trichocarpa genome sequence http://genome.jgi-psf.org found one apparently full-length lkr/sdh gene flanked by two partial genes containing either a fragmented lkr region or a fragmented sdh region, respectively. for further discussion, the poplar genes are referred to as the lkr gene  <dig> and gene  <dig>  several observations argue against the poplar bac sequence being an artifact and that the bac sequence assembly is more accurate than the current version of the p. trichocarpa genome sequence. when aligned, the three poplar gene sequences show more conservation of exon sequences than intron sequences which have major divergences , and the coding sequences all have distinct differences. although the few poplar lkr/sdh ests are from 3- <dig> different species of populus , the two complete lkr/sdh genes have distinctive 3' utrs with matching ests  that indicates ests originating from both genes . the most likely cause of the discrepancy between the bac and the genomic assembly is the three tandem lkr/sdh gene sequences led to errors in the shotgun genome assembly, although not ruled out are differences between p. trichocarpa germplasms.

the poplar monofunctional lkr gene in ends at about  <dig> bp 3' to the end of exon  <dig> when compared to the full-length genes . in addition, the sequence has a frameshift in exon  <dig>  caused by a tc to tctc difference in sequence compared to the two full-length genes. only five ests are available for the 5' end of the poplar lkr sequences and none match the monofunctional lkr gene sufficient to suggest any transcripts from that gene. however, these are too few ests to rule out gene activity, and the apparent frameshift would need to be confirmed.

multiple transcripts from single lkr/sdh genes
alternative transcript production from individual genes is a mechanism to expand potential protein diversity. this strategy can include both differential splicing of exons and multiple promoter sites, sometimes with the two in concert. the most extensive analyses have been with mammalian systems - where estimates are that more than half of the genes are involved in alternative splicing and nearly half have alternative promoters  <cit> . more limited analyses in plants indicate that upwards of 20% of plant genes are involved in alternative splicing  <cit> . an analysis of the conservation of alternative splicing between a dicot  and monocot  concluded that since there was little conservation between the two plant groupings, this implied a limited role for alternative splicing in expanding the plant proteome  <cit> . however, even if specific alternative splicings are not conserved between dicots and monocots, this does not mean there are not important functional differences since such major differences in plant architecture, development, biochemistry, and genome organization are well-known.

the lkr/sdh gene, with its large number of exons, bifunctional nature, evidence of bi- and monofunctional transcripts, and diverse functional associations, would seem a good candidate for the study of multiple transcripts. the few reports on the relative abundance of monofunctional lkr or sdh mrnas have not been consistent. it has been reported that the sdh mrna is more abundant than lkr/sdh in arabidopsis  <cit> , a finding not evident in an earlier report  <cit> . in comparison, in mouse the lkr/sdh form was found more abundant than the sdh form  <cit> . the mouse study also failed to find evidence of a monofunctional lkr form. in plants, the only report of monofunctional lkr mrnas is in cotton  <cit> , although the authors speculate on the existence in other plants.

an analysis was carried out on three potential sources of multiple transcripts from the lkr/sdh gene - evidence for monofunctional lkr ests, monofunctional sdh ests, and alternative splicing using major collections of wheat and other plant ests. all available wheat lkr/sdh ests were aligned to the predicted full-length coding sequence . of the  <dig> wheat ests, only  <dig> initiate in the lkr or linker domains , while  <dig> ests match the sdh domain . two observations suggest that most of the ests represent monofunctional sdh transcripts with only a few full-length bifunctional transcripts. if most of these sdh-domain ests were from bifunctional transcripts, there would be a gradation of 5' termini of the ests across the full-length sequence. normally, ests from the 5' end of a sequence would be less represented for two reasons: longer transcripts, such as for lkr/sdh, will tend to be represented by more truncated clones during the cloning process, and since mrnas are isolated via their 3' polya sequences, 3' coding sequences in clones will be favored. therefore, within a specific est collection the ests will tend to terminate at the polya site 3', and form a continuous pattern of truncated to full-length 5' termini. figure  <dig> shows that instead of a gradual pattern, there is a relatively abrupt concentration of 5' ends around the area appropriate for the 5' end of monofunctional sdh transcripts. a second observation suggests a lack of wheat monofunctional lkr ests. all  <dig> ests that initiate within the lkr domain are 5' to 3' sequence reads with no est reads consistent with 3' to 5' reads from the polya end of mrnas, as would be expected if there were lkr monofunctional ests in the existing wheat ests. three of those  <dig> lkr ests also have 3' reads off the same clones , and in all three cases the 3' sequence is from the 3' terminus of the sdh domain - thus confirming these three clones as originating from full-length lkr/sdh transcripts.

similar analyses were taken for ests from other plants . the sum result from rice, sorghum, maize, arabidopsis, brachypodium, medicago, and barley are similar; i.e., a preponderance of sdh domain ests -  <dig> sdh and  <dig> lkr . of those plant lkr region ests, none are 3' reads - indicating bifunctional transcripts in these plants, but no evidence for lkr monofunctional transcripts. an exception was found in ests of switchgrass  where there were  <dig> lkr ests and  <dig> sdh ests . of the  <dig> lkr ests, there were five paired reads where clones were sequenced from both ends. one of those five pairs is from a chimeric cdna clone since this 3' est  is from a hypothetical gene elsewhere in the genome. three of these 3' ests from paired reads and two unpaired 3' read ests  had poly-a sequences  - indicating support for monofunctional lkr mrnas. all five 3' est included sequences within intron  <dig> and contain a stop codon  near the position of the reported stop in the arabidopsis  monofunctional lkr sequence  <cit> . est gd <dig> also reads into intron  <dig>  but is not shown since the sequence quality is poor. thus, to generate switchgrass monofunctional lkr transcripts, instead of splicing out intron  <dig> at least part of the intron is retained and poly-a added. whether the monofunctional lkr transcripts are the result of differential processing of a full-length lkr/sdh initial transcript or termination after transcribing the lkr domain is not confirmed, but we assume the latter. note that the switchgrass lkr ests fall into two sequence classes with very similar sequences through the presumptive coding sequence, but diverging more 3' to the stop codon  - likely representing the two genomes of tetraploid switchgrass. no similar evidence was found for other plants, including brachypodium which currently has the largest number of lkr/sdh ests  of any plant. none of those brachypodium ests were in the lkr region. similarly, blast analysis with the portion of the brachypodium gene intron  <dig> resulted in no significant matches, and thus no evidence of brachypodium lkr monofunctional sequences such as in switchgrass.

the second monofunctional sequence report from the lkr/sdh gene is for the sdh domain only. as discussed previously, the wheat est alignment in figure  <dig> supports that most of the wheat lkr/sdh ests are from monofunctional sdh transcripts and a smaller number of bifunctional transcripts. further support for these two transcript populations is given in figure 10a where a segment of the wheat sequence alignment is shown to include two est populations. the first seven est sequences directly join exons  <dig> and  <dig>  in agreement with consensus sequences of other plants. the remaining ests start with a sequence found within intron  <dig> . as shown in figure 11b, the monofunctional sdh transcripts includes an exon not found in the full-length lkr/sdh transcript - an exon composed of sequence from the middle of intron  <dig> dna of a full-length gene. this would be intron  <dig> of the monofunctional sdh sequence and separated from the following exon  by  <dig> bp with splice canonical junctions . consistent with polymerase ii initiation sites  <cit> , a presumptive tata box  is at - <dig> bp to the 5' end of the wheat ests with the most 5' matching sequences . between the tata box and the est sequences is a pyrimidine-rich segment - again consistent with transcription initiation sites  <cit> . once the sdh transcript is spliced, the first atg codon that allows a reading frame consistent with an sdh sequence occurs in the middle of sdh exon  <dig>  as indicated in figure 10b and the downward arrowhead at position  <dig> of figure  <dig>  this position is consistent with the translation initiation site reported for arabidopsis , but is in contrast to a previous report  <cit>  that predicted the maize monofunctional sdh transcript used a tata box at the end of exon  <dig> and initiated translation near the beginning of exon  <dig>  however, there was no est support of those previously reported predictions.

besides wheat, only two other plant species' est collection contained sequences consistent with transcript initiation within intron  <dig>  one of those was brachypodium as shown in additional file 11a. four brachypodium ests  have identical 5' ends that begin immediately following the pyrimidine-rich region and may represent the actual start site for brachypodium monofunctional sdh transcripts. those four ests plus six other brachypodium ests all match the junction of the intron 14-derived monofunctional sdh first exon to sdh exon  <dig>  as show in additional file 11b - and match the same structure as with wheat . finally, although there are only a few poplar lkr/sdh ests, they also support the existence of both bifunctional and sdh monofunctional transcripts. ests dv <dig> and dy <dig> have 5' sequences reading from intron  <dig> sequence into exon  <dig>  suggesting sdh monofunctional transcript. poplar ests cx <dig> and cn <dig> read directly from exon  <dig> into exon  <dig> with no intervening intron  <dig> sequence, supporting a bifunctional lkr/sdh transcript .

the lack of est support for monofunctional mrnas in many systems does not mean they do not exist, but only that the est resources do not support them. however, it does continue to support a preponderance of sdh transcripts, bi- and monofunctional, which suggests differential contributions of the lkr and sdh domains to plant cell metabolism.

finally, the analysis of plant ests failed to convincing support for major multiple populations of alternatively spliced transcripts for the  <dig> dicot and  <dig> monocot lkr/sdh exons . small numbers of differential splicing were found in several plants , but none in sufficient numbers to suggest differential roles in plant cell metabolism rather than examples of aberrant splicings with no functional roles. for example, a close examination of the wheat ests suggests a small number of such alternative splicings. the five wheat ests that cover the region that includes the bifunctional consensus start codon represent three sequences - presumably from the three hexaploid wheat genomes. ests bj <dig> and cj <dig> match the bac a-genome sequence exactly, while cj <dig> is a second sequence and fl <dig> plus bj <dig> represents the third sequence. although est bj <dig> spans the start codon region of the bac sequences, it, unlike the other four ests, does not encode the same atg codon - exon  <dig> is missing, with the splice going from the end of exon  <dig> to the beginning of exon  <dig>  in another wheat example, three pairs of ests  show multiple variant splicing at the 3' end of the sdh sequence: cj965444+cj953360; cj950703+cj962606; cj567209+cj <dig>  these three different original cdnas continue transcription into post-exon- <dig> genomic sequence, and differentially splice previous sequence after exon  <dig> . no obvious consensus splice site sequences are evident, but the three sequences use at least one different splice site from other cdnas. more in-depth est sequencing of more plants should clarify the existence and possible roles of specific alternative splicings.

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation and characterization of a segment of the wheat genome containing the lkr/sdh gene is shown. the wheat lkr/sdh genomic segment was found to originate from the a-genome of wheat, and est analysis indicates all three lkr/sdh genes in hexaploid wheat are transcriptionally active, at least for monofunctional sdh transcripts. comparative analyses with other plant lkr/sdh genes and ests shows conservation of the basic exon/intron organization between the wheat gene and previously analyzed genes from maize and arabidopsis and previously unanalyzed genes from rice, medicago, grape, poplar, sorghum, and brachypodium. relative conservation of exon+intron length, even in plants whose genome sizes differ by 30-fold or more, further supports the intergenic regions as sites of genome expansion. exceptions to the general gene length conservation are arabidopsis and grape, whose lkr/sdh genes are shorter and longer, respectively, due to shorter and longer intron lengths. for arabidopsis, the smaller introns are consistent with the general compactness of the arabidopsis genome. however, the basis and functionality of larger grape introns is not consistent with genes from plants with similarly-sized genomes. both the structure of the lkr/sdh gene and the sets of immediately adjacent genes within the genome show lineage-specific differences between monocots and dicots, including different gene positionings and different copy numbers of an adjacent pectinesterase gene. two findings suggest variation in structure and activity of lkr/sdh genes among plants. first, although most plants seem to contain a single conserved lkr/sdh gene, poplar possesses multiple genes. second, there are differences among plants in evidence for bifunctional and monofunctional lkr and sdh transcripts among the available est data. the analyses of ests provides some of the most detailed data for multiple transcripts from a single gene, particularly evidence for monofunctional lkr transcripts in switchgrass and monofunctional sdh transcripts in wheat and brachypodium. there is also evidence in these plants that the monofunctional lkr transcripts read into an intron of the full-length sequence, and for an additional exon for sdh transcripts composed of a central portion of a full-length intron. the lack of similar est evidence in other species may be due to sampling differences in est production, but also may indicate fundamental differences in lkr/sdh control and function.
