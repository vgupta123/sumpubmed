BACKGROUND
puccinia triticina  has a complex life cycle which includes five different spore types and two hosts: wheat  and meadow rue . the latter plant is the so-called alternate host on which the fungus completes its sexual stage  <cit> . sex is not essential and infection of and spread on wheat through re-infection constitutes the asexual cycle. the brown-coloured urediniospores from which the rust got its name, are the asexual infectious propagules. they are easily carried long distances by prevailing winds and can lead to epidemics. early processes in infection include urediniospore attachment, germination and the formation of a germtube. the tips of germtubes differentiate into appressoria which develop over stomatal lips and entry into the substomatal cavity is gained forcibly by turgor pressure. within  <dig> hrs after spore germination, a haustorial mother cell is formed adjacent to a plant cell within the cavity and cell wall penetration takes place. subsequent invagination of the host plasmalemma results in the first intimate contact. thereafter, a microscopically visible haustorial interface surrounding the mature feeding structure, is produced, likely made up of both fungal and host material  <cit> . this interface is critical in governing protein and metabolite traffic  <cit>  since haustoria are thought to secrete a suite of proteins, some of which are aimed at suppressing host defence responses that may be triggered by the fungus when it penetrates the plant cell wall or at establishing the feeding interaction. in compatible interactions, the fungus colonizes the plant and within  <dig> days can produce uredinia  containing asexual urediniospores which are released and give rise to new rounds of infection.

on senescing wheat plants, uredinia respond to cues and switch to producing black teliospores. these are survival propagules with a complex, multi-layered wall and no vacuoles. they contain lipid droplets and glycogen-like material  <cit> . teliospores are primarily 2-celled with each cell containing two haploid nuclei that have paired, if not fused to form the diploid state  <cit> . they often appear in low numbers on the lower parts of the plant, including the stem. under the proper conditions, the teliospore germinates and a metabasidium forms, generally from both cells, in which meiosis occurs and on which four haploid basidiospores develop. a third mitotic division occurs resulting in basidiospores having two nuclei though being monokaryons, containing two nuclei of the same type  <cit> . these basidiospores are ephemeral and can be dispersed to infect the alternate host. this infection occurs via direct penetration of the plant epidermis and the subsequent production of monokaryotic  haustoria. these structures are extensions of the intercellular hyphae which penetrate the plant cells in a manner reminiscent of that described for the corn smut fungus, ustilago maydis  <cit> . neither infection shows the morphological specialization seen for the p. triticina dikaryotic  haustorium  <cit> . upon establishing a feeding relationship and presumably suppressing alternate host defence responses, the monokaryotic hyphae yield specialized pycnia which generate pycniospores embedded in nectar. because they originated from haploid meiotic products, the pycniospores represent different mating types and can cross-fertilize, often through the action of insects attracted by the nectar. after fertilization, that is, the fusion of one pycniospore to a receptive hypha in the pycnium of a different mating type followed by nuclear transfer, the newly formed dikaryon undergoes developmental reprogramming. the resultant mycelium traverses the leaf and forms aecia on the underside in which dikaryotic aeciospores develop  <cit> . aeciospores are dispersal propagules which will infect the primary wheat host.

the generation of genomic resources for the cereal rust fungi is gearing up. a draft genome sequence for the related stem rust fungus, p. graminis f. sp. tritici  was released in  <dig>  a rough draft for pt was released in  <dig>  and genome sequences are being generated for the related wheat stripe rust fungus, p. striiformis f. sp. tritici . the generation of expressed sequence tags  is essential for proper gene prediction in genomes. previous pt est libraries contributed to gene discovery and stage-specific expression analyses  <cit> . similar est collections were generated from other puccinia species  <cit> . however, all these studies were focused on urediniospores and the wheat infection cycle. there is no molecular data on genes involved in the sexual stages in the rusts. unique to this study, we surveyed three other spore types representing the sexual stage: teliospores, pycniospores and aeciospores. we found that each spore type yielded rather specific est sequences and that pycniospores and teliospores in particular seemed to express a unique set, when compared to all other sampled stages.

in addition, we generated and analysed ests from two sets of isolated haustoria and from the germinated urediniospore stage. haustoria ests included a large set of unique sequences of unknown function. in total, over  <dig>  new ests, of which many appeared spore-specific, were added to our existing collection of  <dig>  sequences and compiled into a single unigene set. subsequently, fungal genes were predicted using bioinformatic algorithms trained on pgt sequences, and were then compared to pgt and model basidiomycete plant pathogen, u. maydis genomic resources. notably, comparison to u. maydis revealed interesting leads for research into spore biology.

RESULTS
life cycle stage-specific cdna libraries
three different sexual stage spore types - minute amounts of nectar, containing pycniospores of different mating types, as well as dikaryotic aeciospores, were collected from thalictrum pycnia and aecia residing on the upper and abaxial side of leaves, respectively. both life cycle stages were from the same isolate, but different from race  <dig>  race  <dig> teliospores were induced on senescing wheat and small amounts of dormant spores cleanly dissected from telial pustules. from these three stages, only nanogram-amounts of total rna could be obtained. from the aeciospore material, cdna library pt <dig> was constructed and the pycniospore rna resulted in library pt <dig>  the rna from the teliospores produced cdna library pt <dig> 

isolated haustoria -the haustorium is an important structure involved in bidirectional traffic of proteins and uptake of nutrients and ests might reveal expression of genes involved in host defence suppression and fungal feeding process. moreover, haustoria are expected to produce effectors, some of which might have avirulence functions as has been shown to occur in other systems  <cit> . we therefore isolated haustoria from heavily-infected wheat leaves and produced two cdna libraries from two different isolates: library designation pt <dig>  and ptdh .

germtube - rust isolate wbrs-97- <dig> was also used to produce a cdna library from urediniospores germinated over water, library designation ptdg, from which bi-directional reads were generated.

d number of unigenes not represented in other stages 

several of the cdna libraries were generated from rna isolated from infected plants and would contain host cdna; other  contaminants are also fairly abundant when such approaches are used. therefore, we predicted the putative fungal genes using two approaches, ab initio and comparative genomics; we compared the results and now present a consolidated prediction set of  <dig>  genes.

ab initio gene prediction approach using the est version of genemarks
the est version of genemarks, an extension of a self-training method for gene calling  <cit> , was used to derive gene models in three steps . first, from  <dig>  pt unigenes, we selected  <dig>  sequences longer than  <dig> nt. this set of sequences was used as an input to genemarks self-training to obtain an initial estimation of the parameters for the underlying generalized hidden markov model , particularly parameters of the 2nd order markov chain model of a protein-coding region. thus, estimated parameters were used in genemark.hmm  <cit>  to generate the set of pt gene predictions. notably, due to a likely presence of contaminant sequences, the initial set of genes may include genes from species other than pt and therefore the set of parameters might be biased.

second, to further improve estimates of the hmm parameters, we proceeded with validation of the automatically derived training set. we used blastp to search for homologs of predicted pt proteins among  <dig>  proteins encoded in the genome of pgt. at a cut-off e-value of 1e- <dig>  this procedure identified a set of  <dig>  pt genes with pgt homologs. this reduced set was used as a refined pt training set to derive parameters for the 4th order markov model of a protein-coding region, a critically important submodel of the ghmm.

third, the improved ghmm was used to make gene predictions in the same  <dig>  pt unigene sequences as in step  <dig>  now a much smaller set of  <dig>  predicted pt genes was produced. figure  <dig> shows the comparison between the results of analysis of est fragments by the 2nd and 4th order models in terms of distribution of numbers of predicted coding regions per single est fragment.

the 4th order model was more specific; it omitted  <dig>  genes identified by the 2nd order model. a comparative g + c content analysis of the genes predicted by the 2nd and 4th order models showed that the genes predicted by the 4th order model had a slightly higher g + c content than those predicted by the 2nd order model . notably, a number of genes now absent from the predictions could be attributed to contaminant sequences, possibly from the wheat host .

also, we observed that the use of the 4th order model led to a significant increase, by  <dig> , in the number of fragments with no genes predicted. a total of  <dig>  unigenes out of  <dig>  analyzed unigenes longer than  <dig> nt, were identified as containing no fungal genes. still, these  <dig>  unigenes did contain protein-coding sequences. when we switched gene prediction model in genemark.hmm to a generic 2nd order heuristic model specific for genomic dna with a given g + c content  <cit> , we identified  <dig>  protein coding regions . however, at e < 10- <dig>  blastp searches revealed similarity to pgt proteins for only  <dig> out of these  <dig>  predicted proteins and  <dig> had similarity to proteins in the ncbi nr database. of the  <dig> "non-pgt" proteins, at least  <dig> had similarity to proteins in plants, human and e. coli thus indicating possible contaminants . the majority of the  <dig>  predicted protein coding regions  had lengths of less than  <dig> nt. it is likely that these est sequences represent 5', or 3'- utrs and predicted short coding regions are mere artifacts or represent very small proteins.

comparative genomics approach using blastn
as part of a pt genome sequencing project , an initial set of short genome sequences generated through ' <dig> pyrosequencing'  was available. the  <dig>  est unigene sequences were compared by blastn to this genome collection and  <dig>  yielded significant matches at e < 10- <dig>  this number differed from the pt unigene set of  <dig>  that we arrived at upon using genemarks; a blastn comparison showed the two sets had  <dig>  unigenes in common. at this early stage of pt genome analysis it is uncertain how much coverage has been obtained with the 454-genomic reads. in addition,  <dig> out of the  <dig> unigene sequences not called by genemark.hmm but matching pgt proteins by blast , had blastn hits to the pt genomic reads. we therefore assembled a final set of  <dig>  putative pt unigenes composed of the union of the two predicted sets. of these,  <dig>   were contributed through this new study and constitute over 85% of the total  <dig>  newly-added unigene sequences. the percentage of called fungal sequences was even higher for individual spore stages  indicating the expected purity of collected spore samples.

using the blastn algorithm, out of the total set of  <dig>  est unigenes,  <dig>  did not match any sequences in the surveyed databases although  <dig>  still matched the preliminary pt genome reads in a blastn search and  <dig>  the more-inclusive predicted fungal unigene set. whether these sequences represent pt-specific gene sequences or transcribed genome regions where no genes have  been predicted, remains to be investigated. although such sequences do not currently contribute to gene discovery, they will be valuable for the verification of gene models or transcribed regions in the completed genome sequence.

frameshift detection
although one would expect to see just one continuous protein-coding region per unigene, in the output of the est version of genemarks with the pt-specific 4th order model, we could identify up to nine predicted genes per unigene and sometimes no genes . multiple predictions could be explained by the presence of sequencing errors. to identify possible frameshifts caused by sequencing errors or chimeric cdna inserts, a new frameshift prediction program genetack  <cit>  was applied to  <dig>  ests with several genes predicted in the same strand. separate genes with no detected frameshifts were identified in  <dig>  ests  whereas a single frameshift was predicted in  <dig> ests . protein-coding regions with several frameshifts were identified in the remaining  <dig> ests . coding sequences with a single predicted frameshift were conceptually translated. this approach produced  <dig> sequences used to validate the genetack frameshift predictions by a blastp search against the pgt proteome  and the ncbi non-redundant database . at e < 10- <dig>  database hits overlapping the sites of predicted frameshifts confirmed  <dig> frameshift predictions; in most cases the frameshift was caused by misinterpretation of single-pass reads. when inspection of sequencing electropherograms allowed, the corresponding est sequences were corrected.

contaminants
several cdna libraries were constructed from host infection stages. in order to not discard any potential fungal sequences from our unigene set, we employed a rather conservative strategy which most likely left in the database a number of "contaminating" wheat host sequences. to further understand the discrepancy between the total set of  <dig>  est unigenes and the  <dig>  predicted fungal unigenes, all unigenes were also compared by blastn to a large collection of available wheat est sequences to identify possible host contaminants. some  <dig>  unigenes matched wheat ests at e < 10- <dig> and just over  <dig>  had similarity to a 1x wheat genome coverage of '454-generated' sequences . still, 42% of unigenes matching wheat sequences  also matched the preliminary pt genomic reads. since e-values are related to the size of the database, care has to be taken when directly comparing values obtained from databases of significantly different sizes. nevertheless, in a smaller est unigene set  <cit> , we had also observed unigenes that matched fungal and wheat sequences with e-values in a similar range. whether possibly horizontal gene transfer during co-evolution is involved might be solved once the genomes of both organisms are available.

some  <dig>  sequences were not included in the 'putative pt fungal' set; they did not match the preliminary, still partial pt genome reads. of these 63%  did not match any sequences in the databases surveyed. however,  <dig> sequences matched pgt proteins at e < 10- <dig>  2% matched sequences in the nr database, 11% matched wheat ests, 22% matched fungal and oomycete ests in cogeme  <cit> , and 30% matched sequences in est-other. those sequences without database matches  were mainly derived from one appressorial library , from one specific germinated urediniospore stage library pt <dig> , and from a wheat-infection stage library library pt <dig> . what these three cdna libraries had in common was that cdna inserts were generated by pcr which can reduce tag size. when the size distribution of these  <dig>  unigene sequences was evaluated, almost 45% had lengths of less than  <dig> bp . when a comprehensive pt genome is available, these sequences will be re-evaluated.

annotation and classification of ests
the  <dig>  pt est unigene sequences and the predicted fungal subset were compared by tblastx or blastx to various databases. using a cut-off value of e < 10- <dig>  approximately 40% of the putative fungal subset of  <dig>  unigenes matched ncbi's nr, with a similar number matching the uniprot database. the corresponding percentages were 27% for the fungal and oomycete-specific est database cogeme and almost 60% for dbest . when the total  <dig> -member unigene set was compared to dbest, roughly a third more  matched, but most of these  scored with low significance at e < 10- <dig> 

preliminary annotation was achieved for  <dig>  unigenes by choosing the most informative header arising from the various database blast searches  which was not necessarily the most statistically significant return;  <dig>   were judged to be of fungal origin and  <dig> had similarity to ribosomal sequences of various rusts . it is notoriously difficult to assign genes to categories since the proteins they encode can have multiple functions and/or be associated with various aspects of their biology. however, to achieve a better understanding of their role, we analysed all unigenes with the program 'annot8r'  <cit>  which assigned various go , ec  and/or kegg  annotations to almost  <dig>  unigenes.

similarity searches to related fungi
to investigate relatedness of pt sequences to those of its closest known related rust fungus for which substantial genomic resources have been developed, the initial  <dig> -member pt est set as well as the  <dig> -member predicted fungal set were compared to various sets of pgt sequences using several algorithms. the set of  <dig>  putative pt unigenes matched fairly closely the numbers obtained for the initial  <dig>  unigenes, especially for more conserved sequences , indicating that the pt gene finding using the pgt-trained genemark.hmm algorithm and the pt genome filter, had indeed generated a pt-enriched set. the discrepancy was larger when comparing to pgt ests which could indicate that the available pgt genome is not completely covered and/or, more likely, the presence of  contaminants in the available pgt ests, such as the haustorial-specific set which has not been sanitized for fungal sequences. when predicted protein sequences from the pt ests obtained through the blastx algorithm were compared to the predicted proteome from pgt , the numbers were somewhat lower than when compared to the complete translated pgt genome using tblastx. this could indicate that the predicted pgt proteome is a somewhat conservative underestimate or that there are more conserved genomic regions between the species that yield rna and are therefore transcribed but not necessarily translated or might not be recognized by current computer models as bona fide orfs. for example, small secreted proteins are often missed. the data in the tblastx column reveal on average more matches than those in the blastn column, especially in the higher-confidence intervals, which suggests more conservation at the protein level between species and might be expected from protein-coding cdnas . of the  <dig>  predicted fungal unigenes, blastx results indicated  <dig>   had potential orthologs among the predicted pgt proteins ; among  <dig>  unigenes that were identified through blastn matches with pt genomic resources, this percentage was 55%.

a the  <dig>  most-likely pt unigene subset  were compared to available pgt ests and genome sequences , using the algorithms indicated

b results comparing the  <dig>  and  <dig>   gene calls, were identical

e set of  <dig>  predicted proteins from the melampsora laricis-populina genome 

f predicted/valid transcripts 

the pt unigene set was also compared to a set of  <dig>  published, putative wheat stripe rust  ests from comparable life cycle stages . at e < 10- <dig>  roughly 20% of the pt fungal unigenes matched this pst collection, whereas almost half matched the pgt resources  which themselves have an estimated genome coverage of approximately 92%. the current number of gene calls for pgt is  <dig> ,  <dig>  when disregarding many transposable element-  related calls, and will likely be similar for pt . we have only compared a partial pt gene set, based on the est unigenes, but, assuming we can extrapolate the numbers, these surprisingly low percentages suggest substantial species-specific gene complements and could indicate considerable genome evolution. indeed, even though these rust fungi are considered to belong to the same genus, they fall into well-separated phylogenetic sub-clades  <cit> . gene divergence could occur due to strong selection of these biotrophs. by comparison, two related biotrophic smut fungi from different genera, u. maydis and sporisorium reilianum, still share an average 74% amino acid identity among predicted proteins  <cit> . a closer look at the set of unigenes that matched pt genome sequences but not pgt resources , revealed that  <dig> unigenes had representation in the 'in planta infection' and 'isolated haustoria' cdna libraries ,  <dig> in urediniospores ,  <dig> in pycniospores ,  <dig> in teliospores  and less than  <dig> in other stages. as a percentage of their respective pools , this suggests that genes expressed in these four life cycle stages might be under different selection pressures. using this rough estimate, the highest discrepancy between pt and pgt is seen among genes expressed during plant infection and it could be argued that many of those represent virulence factors likely under selection pressure as has been seen among poplar rust, melampsora species  <cit> .

a particular focus of this study was to compare the pt unigenes to u. maydis genomic resources since this fungus is the best-studied, closest-related model representing cereal-biotrophic basidiomycete interactions. we have previously illustrated the possibility of using the u. maydis model system for performing functional analyses of pt genes  <cit> . a blastx search against the  <dig>  predicted u. maydis proteins  <cit>  yielded  <dig>  matches at e < 10- <dig>   <dig>  with significant similarity at e < 10- <dig> . most matching pt unigenes  were predicted 'fungal' as might be expected from genes having orthologs in basidiomycetes belonging to different genera . indeed, a large majority of  <dig>  pt-um "pairs"  also matched pgt proteins suggesting the existence of a common set of proteins/functions among these basidiomycetes. however,  <dig> pt-um "pairs"  did not match pgt proteins. in a complementary approach, the complete set of  <dig>  predicted pgt proteins was compared to the same set of um proteins, yielding  <dig>  matches of which  <dig>   revealed significant similarities at e < 10- <dig>  of these pgt-um "pairs",  <dig>   also matched pt unigenes; this smaller percentage likely reflects the large comprehensive pgt genome-predicted protein set compared to the pt est subset. the identification of many homologs and the existence of many um gene deletion mutants or the ease with which um gene deletions can be obtained  <cit> , could allow for functional pt gene analyses through complementation in u. maydis  <cit> .

spore-specific unigenes
one unique aspect of this study is the generation of ests from sexual spores from this macrocyclic, heterocious cereal rust. teliospores, pycniospores, aeciospores and urediniospores were fresh and considered to be in a 'dormant' stage ready for dispersal, although the physiologic state of pycniospores in nectar is uncertain. the non-redundant unigenes generated for each spore type were filtered for putative fungal sequences  and the overlap between spore-specific transcripts was assessed . although it is unlikely that we sampled the cdna libraries to saturation, it was striking that all four spore stages generated a large percentage of seemingly unique sequences. rna sequencing or microarray analyses will have to be performed to verify levels of transcription, but the data presented here suggests that these unique stages express sets of genes that are needed for specific developmental programs. tentative annotations were assigned to  <dig> unigenes and are given in additional file  <dig>  overall, each spore stage seemed to express large numbers of genes involved in metabolism, energy production and conversion, translation and protein turn-over . pycnio- and teliospores seemed to have yielded a larger number of ribosomal protein genes possibly related to more active protein production. we noted also several transporters  and several possible transcription factors, such as seven ring- or zn-finger containing proteins in pycniospores. interestingly, the urediniospore stage revealed the best annotated set relative to the number of unigenes, followed by pycniospores, then teliospores and a disproportionate set was found for aeciospores. whether this reflects larger sets of novel genes expressed in these latter stages, remains to be discovered.

several unigenes revealed interesting putative functions, in particular among the ests from the pycniospore library, a stage not yet covered in the literature. ptcontig <dig> matched a pheromone transporter from cryptococcus neoformans, a human opportunistic basidiomycete pathogen, and was covered by sequences from  <dig> different cdna clones from only that cell type. contig <dig>  matched pheromone receptor sequences in many fungi  and was similar to a 357-amino acid protein in pgt. pt and related rusts are thought to possess bipolar mating systems   <cit>  although some might possess multiple-allelomorphic tetrapolar systems similar to the higher mushrooms  <cit> . because pycniospores are haploid cells in which mating type has segregated and are primed for mating to form the dikaryotic aeciospores, they are expected to express mating-type specific genes. in rusts, no information on mating-type genes has been published. it would be tremendously valuable to uncover the molecular basis of the mating system and reveal the structure of mat loci in cereal rusts. the revealed pt pheromone receptor gene, pra, could represent a component of the mating-type locus. contig <dig>  has similarity to a protein belonging to the oligopeptide opt transporter family found in many fungi and annotated as 'sexual differentiation process protein isp4'. the pycniospore stage also revealed several genes involved in sterol biosynthesis with possible roles in mating . in s. cerevisiae, sterols have been shown to be involved in cell fusion during mating, for example, sphingolipid and ergosterol biosynthetic mutants fail to polarize proteins to the tip of the deforming yeast cell  and are therefore deficient in mating  <cit> . however, another ergosterol biosynthesis gene, erg <dig>  and an oxysterol-binding protein , were found in the teliospores library, whereas a sterol o-acyltransferase  had one representative est in urediniospores and one in germinated urediniospores. among the whole unigene set, a few contigs,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , were obtained only from the pycniospore library and were most similar to pgt predicted protein pgtg_ <dig> , a carbon catabolite-derepressing protein kinase. a comparative multiple sequence alignment of dna sequences in alignx confirmed all three pt unigenes were closely related but had four approximately  <dig> bp-stretches of dna that were shared in different combinations. whether these represent unique genes or are different splice products will be solved once the pt genome is available; however, the unique stretches did not match predicted introns in various pgt homologs of which there were many . we are interested in developmental-specific kinases and intriguingly, these pt contigs also bore great resemblance to the catalytic subunit of camp-dependent protein kinase, known to be involved in responsiveness to mating pheromone in several fungi  <cit> .

teliospores are survival propagules and are melanized for protection. contig <dig> , matched a diphenol/urishiol  oxidase or laccase , an enzyme found in fungi and plants which oxidizes different phenols and diamines and is implicated in the production of melanin pigment.

several unigenes had est representation mainly in all spore stages: contig <dig> , contig <dig>  and contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . it is possible that certain genes are involved in general spore-forming processes despite their very different morphology and physiology.

correlating elevated est levels of spore-specific libraries between p. triticina and u. maydis
spore production is critical to the dispersal of rusts and smuts; therefore, knowledge of the development and biology of spores is essential to understanding disease spread. since spore development in these fungi requires growth in the host plant, it is reasonable to assume that their development is triggered in response to a signal received from the host. in this context, identifying genes with elevated transcript levels in spores of both fungi may lead to the discovery of common responses to plant signals. of the four pt rust spore stages we generated ests from in this study, only teliospores have a biological equivalent in the life cycle of um . comparing expression among libraries of these two species is complicated by variation in library preparation methods, notably the requirement to include an amplification step to clone cdnas from the low levels of pt teliospores, and the need to normalize libraries being compared to correct for est pool size. with these limitations, we expected to find few commonly expressed genes. additional file  <dig> shows that pt contig <dig>  a putative mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in protein import, has elevated numbers of ests in both teliospore derived libraries. elevated numbers of ests in pt contig <dig>  a nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, originated from pt pycniospore and teliospore libraries. the similar um <dig>  has elevated est numbers in um teliospore and haploid cell libraries . pt pycniospores and um haploid cells are both descendents of basidiospores, the direct products of meiosis. the discovery of these genes is interesting and they deserve further investigation. however, the fact that we found any commonly expressed genes given the limitations in the analysis is perhaps more important and supports a deeper analysis of the teliospore transcriptome in these fungi.

comparing libraries from other spore  types that are functionally equivalent between pt and um revealed further similarities in elevated est levels. four pt contigs with elevated numbers in the pycniospore had homologs with elevated numbers in um haploid cells or germinating teliospores. two represent conserved hypothetical proteins and the others represent cofilin, an actin binding and severing protein, and a 26s proteasome non-atpase regulatory subunit . six pt contigs having elevated est counts in the germinated urediniospore stage had um homologs with higher number of ests, relative to the other stages, in the functionally equivalent um dikaryon . it is notable that four of these were conserved hypothetical proteins. these may represent functionally conserved genes. the function of these genes can be investigated in the tractable um. further expression analysis is required to confirm these results, but finding similarly high est counts between similar cell types supports the benefit of continuing these comparative approaches in more depth using rna sequencing techniques.

d blastx search of pgt genome-predicted proteins at e < 10- <dig> 

secretome-specific unigenes
the combined  <dig>  unigene set was queried using interproscan to identify protein sequences predicted to be secreted. to complement this,  <dig>  proteins predicted from the partial pt genome were queried using the method by joly et al.  <cit>  to yield  <dig> potentially secreted pt proteins. reciprocal blast searches were performed to generate a list of pt-specific, potentially secreted proteins. this list was complemented by searches against a subset of  <dig>  potentially secreted pgt proteins derived similarly from the  <dig>  genome-predicted pgt proteins, and additionally against collected sets of various predicted "secretome" proteins:  <dig> assembled est sequences from various poplar leaf rust fungi, melampsora spp. ,  <dig> identified flax rust, melampsora lini haustoria-specific secreted proteins  <cit> ,  <dig> bean rust, uromyces fabae, secretome proteins  <cit> , and  <dig> described secreted proteins in u. maydis  <cit> . additional file  <dig> shows which pt unigenes are predicted to be secreted or are similar by blast searches to predicted secreted proteins in other  rust or basidiomycete plant biotrophic fungi. the representation of the ests among the various cdna libraries is indicated, representing expression in the respective life cycle stages. striking were the large groupings revealed; a given pt unigene would match various different sequences, up to  <dig> pgt proteins in the case of contig <dig>  with various e-values. these are likely family members of related secreted proteins, some of which seem to belong to clusters . although many such groups were found matching pgt, large poplar rust groups were also evident, and often a pt unigene would match similar large groups in both organisms; sometimes they would match uniquely in poplar rust. a tblastx search of  <dig> pt unigenes predicted to be secreted  against the complete pt unigene set  yielded related pt groups which in general correlated well with the pgt and poplar rust groups .

in general, larger, expanded families tended to have related sequences in all other rusts, including the bean rust . this suggests that such families originate from a more-conserved protein in a common ancestor and likely evolved paralogous family members in the various species. among the pt unigenes coding for ssps that seemed to be puccinia-specific , the families tended to be smaller. figure 4a illustrates an example of a family of proteins that is rather conserved among the various rusts, including the bean rust. we started from pt contig <dig>  a tentative metallothionein, represented by  <dig> ests from the haustorial stage, with  <dig> matches in poplar rust and  <dig> in stem rust. in this comparison, small clades contained mainly paralogous puccinia or melampsora proteins, but there was an overall similarity suggesting the existence of an ancient 'founding' gene member. figure 4b shows an example of puccinia-specific ssps that likely evolved paralogs after speciation. this preliminary pt unigene data set merits close scrutiny on a molecular phylogenetic level once all genomes have been completed and proper protein calls are available.

overall,  <dig>  predicted fungal unigenes, of which  <dig>  matched pt genomic  <dig> reads, had at least one est generated from plant-infected material, represented by the stages pth, pti or ptih. of the  <dig>  unigenes representing isolated haustoria,  <dig> did not match any sequence in various databases including pgt proteins, but of these, still  <dig> were predicted to be fungal and  <dig> matched pt genomic reads. these could represent species-specific genes that are potentially preferentially expressed in haustoria, among which could be effectors. transcript profiling or gene-specific quantitative pcr will be needed to verify whether these genes are expressed uniquely or at elevated levels during plant infection and hence might play important roles.

CONCLUSIONS
the pt est sequences generated, collected and analysed in the current study, enriched by sampling spore stages not covered in other studies, will provide essential information for proper gene calling and annotation of the pt genome currently being assembled. for the first time, all spore stages from a macrocyclic cereal rust fungus, except for basidiospores, have been investigated for expressed genes through this est approach. many obtained unigene sequences from the various spore stages seemed specific suggesting radically different developmental gene sets are involved. unfortunately, many could not be annotated due to lack of similar sequences in the various databases. comparing potential spore-specific gene sequences between pt and the model basidiomycete plant biotroph u. maydis, seems feasible and has yielded some interesting candidates for follow-up studies.

although substantial homology exists between the pt unigene sequences and near-comprehensive genomic resources from the related stem rust fungus, p. graminis f. sp. tritici, many genes seem to have diverged substantially from those from the putative common ancestor and many others appear to be species specific. a preliminary comparative sequence analysis of several bac clones harbouring large pt genomic inserts with the syntenic regions in pgt, seems to corroborate this . future comprehensive comparisons once the genomes of several cereal rust species are available will shed light on the molecular evolution of their genes and genomes.

the generated ests have also been invaluable in generating molecular markers. the current gene sequences have been used to reveal ssrs  which were used in genetic diversity studies  <cit> , and the variation among compiled contigs, potentially being derived from two parental nuclei in case of the dikaryotic material or the  <dig> different isolates used, revealed snps  which are being used to saturate a pt genetic map .

the computational prediction of a comprehensive secretome for pt is one of the goals once the genome sequence is completed. many secreted proteins will function in general fungal development such as cell wall biogenesis, but a significant subset will be crucial to support the biotrophic life style and hence will be considered virulence factors. some will function in generating and maintaining the matrix surrounding haustoria and possibly hyphae roaming the plant tissue and contribute to feeding, but others, effectors among them, will be needed to subdue the host defence machinery. it is anticipated that many of the effectors will represent the many avirulence gene products that trigger resistance in the numerous wheat cultivars. unravelling this complement is crucial in revealing old and new interactions which will aid in breeding durable resistance in our cereal crops.
