BACKGROUND
parkinson's disease  is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after alzheimer's disease   <cit> . pathological characteristics of pd include the progressive and relatively selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and the deposit of protein aggregates in the remaining neurons called lewy bodies   <cit> . the mechanisms underlying pd development and lb formation are not fully characterized, although increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, excitotoxicity, and inflammation are contributing factors  <cit> . of these potential mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction has been studied most extensively. it has been reported by many groups that there is a partial inhibition  of respiratory chain complex i activity in pd patients  <cit> . the importance of complex i inhibition is further substantiated by the fact that mitochondrial toxicants, e.g. 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine   <cit> , a contaminant of a synthetic heroin, and rotenone  <cit> , a plant-derived pesticide, recapitulate parkinsonism in animals that closely resembles human pd.

rotenone is a lipophilic compound that freely crosses cell membranes and accesses cytoplasm and mitochondria. its application in pd research has grown exponentially over the last few years largely due to the discovery of its ability to produce many features of pd in rats, including development of α-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic inclusions similar to lbs in human pd in the remaining nigral neurons  <cit> . in vitro, rotenone appears to produce many cellular effects, e.g. caspase  <dig> activation , change in mitochondrial membrane potential, accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein and ubiquitin, oxidative damage, and endoplasmic reticulum stress  <cit> .

although many of the findings observed in rotenone induced cellular and animal models of pd are also present in the brains of patients with pd, the precise mechanisms through which complex i dysfunction might produce neurotoxicity are as yet unknown. one of the major issues centers on what happens after complex i is inhibited by rotenone. while this question has been approached thus far by testing one hypothesis at a time, the rapidly emerging field of proteomics offers great potential to globally identifying and characterizing mitochondrial proteins involved in these processes in a nonbiased manner. indeed, in the last few years, we, as well as others, have already started to utilize this technology to extensively characterize the proteins interacting with α-synuclein  <cit>  and dj- <dig>  <cit> .

here, we employed a recently introduced proteomics technology called silac   <cit>  combined with mudpit   <cit> , including sds-page  and liquid chromatography , and mass spectrometry  for protein identification as well as quantification in dopaminergic  mes cells exposed to rotenone vs. controls. mes cells are a daergic cell line that have been demonstrated to form cytoplasmic lb-like inclusions after rotenone treatment  <cit> . in this study, however, only mitochondrial proteins, isolated by sucrose-gradient centrifugation, were studied. a total of  <dig> proteins were identified with quantitative proteomics analysis; of those,  <dig> proteins were identified as mitochondrial protein or mitochondria-associated proteins and  <dig> of which displayed significant changes in relative abundance after rotenone treatment. a subset of these proteins was further validated by confocal microscopy and wb to confirm their mitochondrial localization as well as regulation by rotenone. as none of these proteins have been associated with rotenone toxicity previously, our findings represent the first report of these novel mitochondrial proteins affected by rotenone.

RESULTS
evaluation of the purity of mitochondrial isolation
to minimize false positive results in identifying mitochondrial proteins, it is critical to isolate mitochondria with minimal contamination of other organelles. to achieve this goal, we first used an optimized purification procedure, allowing for production of high-purity mitochondria from mes cells. this procedure involved three differential centrifugations followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation using three sucrose densities. the purity of mitochondria was assessed by following the relative distribution of various cellular markers, including cytochrome c for mitochondria, α-tubulin for cytosol, and nucleolin for nucleus. the results, shown in figure  <dig>  demonstrate that mitochondrial protein cytochrome c was highly enriched in the purified mitochondrial fraction while the cytosolic protein α-tubulin and nuclear protein nucleolin were decreased to near or below the limit of detection in the mitochondrial fraction.

identification of mitochondrial proteome in mes cells
pure mitochondrial preparations were isolated from combined extracts of cells exposed to  <dig> nm rotenone  or vehicle  for  <dig> days as described previously  <cit> . sds-page combined with two-dimensional lc followed by tandem ms  analysis identified a total of  <dig> proteins  with more than  <dig> peptides . these results were a combination of two independent experiments. among the identified proteins,  <dig>  were previously identified as mitochondrial proteins based on the protein names in the database. one obvious question is how many of the remaining proteins were also mitochondrial proteins? to address this, we searched all the identified proteins against the most comprehensive mitochondrial proteome database, mitop <dig>  which combines information regarding the genetic, functional and pathogenetic aspects of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. besides data for proteins known to be mitochondrial in origin, mitop <dig> also provides information about putative mitochondrial proteins identified by homology search tools. each protein entry is annotated with function, chromosomal localization, subcellular localization, homologs and associated confidence values, go  number, applicable omim   <cit> , literature references, and cross-references to external databases. our search results showed that  <dig> out of  <dig>  proteins were found in mitop <dig> . the remaining proteins were further searched against swiss-prot database  for subcellular localization or function.  <dig> proteins were "localized" to cytoplasm, nucleus, er, golgi, lysosome, microsome, peroxisome or synaptosome and thus considered likely contaminants. the remaining  <dig> proteins showed unknown functions or unknown localization.

proteins affected by rotenone treatment
we, as well as others, have established that rotenone not only induces cell death but also replicates many cellular processes, e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress  <cit> , which occur in human pd. like our previous studies  <cit> , mes cells treated with rotenone at  <dig> nm demonstrated significant cellular toxicity, losing about 50% of cells by day  <dig> after the treatment started . we used 3-day rotenone treatment regimen because our early investigations have indicated that mes cells treated with rotenone for three days demonstrated cytoplasmic lb-like inclusions immunoreactive to anti-α-synuclein  <cit> , a phenomenon not seen in cells exposed for  <dig> or  <dig> days. quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial protein profiles identified  <dig> proteins that displayed changes in relative abundance in mes cells treated with rotenone vs. controls, using a 2-fold increase or decrease over controls as significant. the results were expressed as combined asapratio  obtained from two independent experiments. by this criterion, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> proteins showed a significant increase or decrease, respectively, after rotenone treatment. of the  <dig> proteins,  <dig> could be found in the mitop <dig> database. these proteins are listed in table  <dig> where those that have been implicated in the cellular processes relevant to neurodegenerative disease or rotenone pathogenesis are noted. figure  <dig> shows a pie chart summarizing the functional categories of the  <dig> proteins. major classes of proteins included those related to transport, metabolism and signal transduction. notably, almost a third of proteins listed in table  <dig> are without known function.

validation of a subset of mitochondrial proteins affected by rotenone
while all proteins listed in table  <dig> are considered mitochondrial proteins based on the mitop <dig> database, not all of them have been validated biochemically or morphologically. also, as proteomics identification of candidate proteins can be wrong owing to current incorrect or incomplete database, candidate proteins need to be validated with alternative means not only for their identification but also for their quantification. it is obviously impractical to validate all the proteins listed in table  <dig>  thus, we chose  <dig> proteins from table  <dig> for their mitochondrial localization as well as quantitative regulation by rotenone; these proteins are: mitogen activated protein kinase kinase  <dig> , sacsin, sonic hedgehog , sorting nexin  <dig> , and vesicle-associated membrane protein  <dig> . this selection was based on the following rationale: 1) all of these proteins were identified by multiple peptides and also have commercially available antibodies; 2) the selected proteins displayed quantitative changes in response to rotenone and were thus more likely to be biologically interesting and less likely to be nonspecific contaminating proteins; and 3) these proteins are involved in cellular processes that might be important in pd pathogenesis, even though none of them have been linked to pd directly to date.

to confirm mitochondrial localization of these proteins, we performed double immunostaining of each of the candidates along with cytochrome c, followed by confocal analysis. of the antibodies tested, only two , shown in figure  <dig>  demonstrated enough sensitivity and specificity for immunocytochemistry. shh was localized to the cytoplasm as well as in the mitochondria but excluded from the nuclei while snx <dig> was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and nuclei. notably, although the staining patterns of these proteins were different from each other, both of them co-localized with cytochrome c to some extent in the mitochondria. it should be emphasized that it is not surprising to see the presence of these proteins in other cellular compartments, as neither of the candidates is synthesized within the mitochondria.

to validate quantitative proteomics results, three sets of mitochondrial proteins were isolated from three independent samples. the cytosolic fraction was also included for comparison. the results of these experiments are summarized in table  <dig>  in the mitochondrial fraction, sacsin and snx <dig> levels were significantly decreased by rotenone exposure, while vamp <dig> levels were significantly increased. these results were in good agreement with our quantitative proteomics results . sacsin and vamp <dig> were also present in the cytosolic fraction of both rotenone and vehicle-treated cells, while snx <dig> was not detectable . we did not observe any significant change in the relative abundance of either sacsin or vamp <dig> in the cytosolic fraction following rotenone exposure. antibody against map2k <dig> was not sensitive/specific enough when assessed by wb. in the case of shh antibody, it responded to immunostaining but showed multiple bands in immunoblotting, which could be biological but made it impossible to compare with the proteomic results. representative wb results for the other three proteins are shown in figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we combined silac labeling, mudpit separation of protein/peptide, including sds-page, and tandem ms to characterize the mitochondrial proteome of mes cells as well as the alterations in the mitochondrial proteome in the presence of rotenone. several major findings have been found from this investigation, including: 1) a total of  <dig> proteins were identified as mitochondrial protein or mitochondria-associated proteins, which is the most comprehensive study of the mitochondrial proteome so far; 2) quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial protein profiles identified  <dig> proteins that displayed changes in relative abundance in mes cells treated with rotenone vs. controls. among these,  <dig> proteins have been represented in the mitop <dig> database as mitochondrial proteins; and 3) a subset of novel mitochondria-associated proteins affected by rotenone was validated by confocal microscopy and wb to assess their localization in the mitochondria as well as quantitative changes as determined by quantitative proteomics.

the first achievement of this study is the comprehensive survey of mitochondrial proteins in mes cells, a daergic cell line widely used for the investigation of pd pathogenesis  <cit> . not only does extensive characterization of the mitochondrial proteome expand current knowledge regarding the profiles of mitochondrial proteins, it also supplies the necessary information to appropriately interpret the mechanisms of rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in pd. comparing the results reported in the literature  <cit> , the current analysis is a much deeper analysis into the mitochondrial proteome in a neuronal cell line, largely owing to better sample separation by sds-page and lc, i.e. extensive fractionation prior to ms analysis. this study, using only 80– <dig> μg of mitochondrial proteins as the starting material, followed by simple lc-ms/ms analysis of  <dig> gel slices in two independent experiments, afforded the conclusive identification of  <dig> proteins. thus, this simple technology seems to be the most effective method of identifying a large number of proteins from different cell types. furthermore, this is the first large-scale study where the mitochondrial proteome from the mes cell line was carefully characterized, providing organelle-specific proteomics information for these cells relevant to pd pathogenesis. among those proteins identified, approximately 50% did not have an apparent orthologue in the mitop <dig> database. several reasons are likely responsible for this absence in the database. first, the current database is still far from complete and most of the missing proteins are hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown functions. second, although the purification protocols for mitochondria have been refined by several groups over many years, the exquisite sensitivity of modern mass spectrometers has revealed that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to purify these or any other organelles to homogeneity. in our study, a small portion of those proteins  was considered as contaminated from cytoplasm, nucleus, er, golgi or lysosome, based on the functional interpretation of swiss-prot database. while the sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation technique we used to isolate the mitochondrial fraction is widely recognized as the technique producing least contamination  <cit> , it remains likely that at least some of these proteins, particularly er proteins, were co-localized in the mitochondrial fraction as contaminants. it is also possible that some of the "contaminating" proteins are partially localized in mitochondria or interact with other mitochondrial proteins. more detailed studies such as immuno-colocalization experiments would be required to distinguish these different possibilities.

next, to better understand the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction induced by rotenone, we used silac to compare the protein profiling of mitochondria in rotenone-treated mes cells versus controls. with silac methods, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> proteins showed significant increase or decrease after rotenone treatment. among these,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins have been present in the mitop <dig> database as mitochondrial proteins respectively. one of the major caveats of proteomics identification of proteins relates to the fact that proteins are inferred by the peptide sequence based on databases, which are currently incomplete. thus, any given identification, with or without quantitative changes, should be considered provisional until it can be validated via alternative means. it is obviously impractical to validate the entire list of proteins listed in additional file  <dig> or even table 1; to this end, we validated five candidate proteins  in terms of their cellular location as well as quantitative alternation after rotenone treatment. two of these proteins, shh and snx <dig>  were co-localized to mitochondria convincingly by confocal investigation. three of these proteins, snx <dig>  sacsin and vamp <dig>  when assessed by wb analysis, showed good agreement with our silac results. it should be noted that there are many caveats associated with wb and immnocytochemistry, such that a negative result by these assays does not necessarily negate what was observed by quantitative proteomics.

the biological importance of the three validated proteins in pd or rotenone pathogenesis is largely unknown. a potential role of sacsin has been implicated in an early onset neurodegenerative disorder, autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of charlevoix-saguenay , which occurs with a high prevalence in the charlevoix-saguenay-lac-saint-jean  region of quebec  <cit> . sacsin contains three regions with hsp <dig> subdomains that have similarity to each other and the protein product of an arabidopsis thaliana orf. the presence of heat shock domains in the sacsin protein suggests its possible function in chaperone-mediated protein folding  <cit> . snx <dig> is a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of plasma membrane receptors  <cit> . it has been proposed to be associated with early endosomes and the regulation of endocytic trafficking of plasma membrane proteins in early endosomes such as epidermal growth factor receptor   <cit>  and protease-activated receptor- <dig>   <cit> . vamp <dig>  an early endosomal vesicular soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein attachment protein receptor , is a membrane trafficking protein of a constitutively recycling pathway  <cit> . although neither snx <dig> nor vamp <dig> has been linked to pd pathogenesis thus far, it has been clearly demonstrated by others that dysfunctions of intracellular trafficking and lysosomal degradation are involved in pd pathogenesis  <cit> . finally, it needs to be pointed out that this investigation is limited in that we have only compared the protein profiles in mes cells treated with rotenone for three days, when lb like inclusions are found  <cit> . it would be important in future experiments to examine earlier time points, revealing factors/pathways leading to cell death prior to formation of lb like inclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have employed silac, combined with 1d sds-page, to characterize numerous mitochondrial proteins in mes cells, representing the most extensive profiling study of mitochondrial proteins to date. furthermore, we identified  <dig> mitochondrial proteins affected by rotenone. finally, we have confirmed  <dig> of these proteins localizing in the mitochondria and quantitatively validated  <dig> of these proteins by wb. detailed characterization of these rotenone-responsive novel proteins will likely facilitate a clearer understanding of pd pathogenesis.
