BACKGROUND
the estimated prevalence of dementia of persons greater than 70 years of age is  <dig> %  <cit> . the yearly cost attributable to dementia is between $ <dig> /patient and $ <dig> /patient and the total monetary cost of dementia in  <dig> was between $ <dig> billion and $ <dig> billion. add to this, the enormous personal and emotional cost to, not only the patient, but also to family, friends, and co-workers, and we have a national tragedy that is about to unfold as the baby boomers transition to the elderly. these financial and personal costs place dementia on par with the costs attributable to ascvd and cancers.

one of the potential inducers of neurovascular inflammation is triglyceride-rich lipoprotein  particles and their lipolysis products  <cit> . lipoprotein lipase  is anchored to the brain microvascular endothelium, where it binds and hydrolyzes tgrl particles to smaller lipolysis products, such as fatty acids  <cit> . tgrl lipolysis products are generated at the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium and the lipolysis products in high physiological and pathophysiological concentrations can potentially injure the endothelium directly, increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier , and/or injure astrocytes and neurons within the brain. our studies have shown that tgrl lipolysis products have a dramatic effect on endothelial cell injury, which is of much greater magnitude than tgrl particles, such as chylomicrons and vldl  <cit> .to explore neurovascular lipotoxicity further, we treated human brain microvascular endothelial cell  with tgrl lipolysis products and then we used genome-wide transcriptional profiling to obtain transcript abundances over four conditions. we then identified regulatory genes and their targets that have been differentially expressed  through analysis of the datasets with various statistical methods . we created a functional gene network by exploiting co-expression observations through a guilt-by-association assumption. concomitantly, we used various network inference algorithms to identify putative regulatory interactions and we integrated all predictions to construct a consensus gene regulatory network that is tgrl lipolysis product specific. this analysis has led to the validation of putative lipid-related targets and the discovery of several genes that may be implicated in tgrl lipolysis-related lipid response. our system biology analysis also identified that activating transcription factors  <dig>  is a principal regulator and induces expression of downstream inflammatory response genes in hbmvec treated with tgrl lipolysis products.

RESULTS
as shown in figure  <dig>  there is some overlap between the different de techniques used, as well as differences in the top gene candidates identified, due to the different features and underlying statistical assumptions of each technique. table  <dig> depicts the top  <dig> genes that have the highest de between the treatment with the combination of tgrl and lpl , and the control  that are within the statistical cut-off value , over all techniques. consistent with our previous results in endothelial cells  <cit> , atf <dig> shows clear up-regulation after tgrl lipolysis product treatment.

the  <dig> de genes that have been in parallel identified from all methods form a functional gene network with  <dig> functional categories that are significantly over-represented in this gene set, which also implicates  <dig> kegg pathways . we integrated the expression-derived relationships with the known protein-protein interaction  network that was extracted by using the bionet bioconductor package  <cit>  and the interactome library  <cit>  . in addition, we used a support vector machines  method called sirene  <cit>  together with a dataset where we amassed of all known tf-gene interactions  in order to construct a condition-specific gene regulatory network  associated with tgrl lipolysis treatment . the resulting network has  <dig> tfs,  <dig> target genes ,  <dig> inhibitory interactions , and  <dig> activatory interactions .

genome-wide analysis of tgrl lipolysis-treated hbmvec
differential analysis of gene expression data showed that hbmvec treated with either lpl or tgrl altered the expression of a small percentage of genes . tgrl + lpl  treatment affected the expression of  <dig> % of all genes detected . functional classification of genes modulated by lipolysis product  treatment identified multiple functional classes including transcription factors, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation, ion metabolism, lipid metabolism, kinase activity, signalling pathways, dna binding, protein binding, protein folding, and proteins of unknown function.

tgrl lipolysis product-induced endothelial cell apoptosis
histone deacetylase  <dig>  plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and developmental events. histone acetylation/deacetylation alters chromosome structure and affects transcription factor access to dna. growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible, alpha  and beta  genes are the first well-defined p <dig> downstream genes. they can be induced by multiple dna-damaging agents and stressful growth arrest conditions, such as ir and uv radiation, and play important roles in the control of cell cycle checkpoint, dna repair processes, and signalling transduction. the protein encoded by this gene responds to environmental stresses by mediating activation of the p38/jnk pathway via mtk1/mekk <dig> kinase. no change in gadd45a and loss function of gadd45b suggested that its normal role in the pituitary includes acting as a brake to cell proliferation and survival  <cit> .despite their central position in the tgrl-centered ppi network, mouse double minute  <dig> homolog  and s <dig> calcium binding protein b  were not found to be differentially regulated in our samples . mdm <dig> is a target gene of the transcription factor tumor protein p <dig> and also affects the cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumorgenesis through interactions with other proteins. over expression of this gene results in excessive inactivation of tumor protein p <dig>  diminishing its tumor suppressor function. s100b is a member of the s <dig> family of proteins containing  <dig> ef-hand calcium-binding motifs. s <dig> proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. the altered expressions of this gene have been implicated in several neurological, neoplastic, and other types of diseases, including alzheimer’s disease.

to gain a better insight on the biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions that are affected by the differentially expressed genes, we performed a functional analysis by using the david toolbox   <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  negative regulation of transcription and biosynthetic processes were highly enriched, as well as the positive regulation of apoptosis and intracellular signalling. not surprisingly, given the implicated metabolic compounds, membrane-related components and various organelles were the most differentially expressed genes were localized. in agreement with our analysis above, the functional enrichment analysis shows a clear differential regulation of transcriptional units, including transcription factor and cofactor binding, repressor activity and enzyme binding.

discussion
the most significant discovery of this study is the robust and rapid induction of genes encoding transcription factors, inflammation, and apoptosis. more specifically, hbmvec treated with tgrl lipolysis products encode transcription factor atf3-related genes in the map kinase pathway associated with ap- <dig> signalling. this, then, stimulates an array of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes that effect endothelial cell injury. atf <dig> can be induced by stress and growth factors in mammalian cells, and is thought to play an important role in the cardiovascular and nervous system. however, little is currently known about how the induction of atf <dig> is regulated, except that the jnk pathway is involved. previous studies have shown up-regulation of atf <dig> to act as either pro-inflammatory  <cit>  or anti-inflammatory  <cit>  and it was more recently linked to alzheimer’s disease through a system-level approach  <cit> . atf <dig> belongs to the atf/cyclic amp responsive element binding  family of transcription factors, characterized by a basic region leucine zipper  motif. the basic region is necessary for binding to the atf/cre promoter and the leucine zipper element for homo-and hetero-dimerization with other bzip proteins to differentially regulate transcription. the dimeric state of atf <dig> gives us clues as to the ultimate effects of atf <dig> on inflammation. as a homo-dimer, atf <dig> acts as a transcriptional regulator inhibiting expression of pro-apoptotic molecules. alternatively, atf <dig> can form a heterodimer with activated c-jun that enhances transcription of stress response genes  <cit> . the transcription of atf <dig> as a key response gene after treatment for 3 hr with tgrl lipolysis products demonstrated that its induction was essential for the expression of a subset of pro-inflammatory responses.

tgrl lipolysis products-induced signalling pathways involve in mitogen-activated protein  kinase, tgf-β and p <dig> signalling. the four major map kinase pathways, erk, jnk, p <dig>  and bmk/erk <dig>  perform activating phosphorylations of nuclear transcription factors. of these, erk has been shown to inhibit atf <dig> expression while jnk activates atf <dig> through transcriptional regulation  <cit> . jnk activation also results in phosphorylation of c-jun, a component with atf <dig> of a complex that binds ap- <dig> responsive promoter regions. as would be expected, c-jun/ap- <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig>  atf <dig>  creb, myc, c/ebpb, erg- <dig>  and other transcription factors have been shown to induce atf <dig> expression  <cit> .

our study has shown that increased expression of atf <dig> occurs early in response to stress by a mechanism requiring the related bzip transcriptional regulator atf <dig>  atf <dig> contributes to induction of the apoptosis-inducing protein ddit <dig> transcriptional factor in response to tgrl lipolysis products at 3 hr. ddit <dig>  chop, or gadd <dig> protein functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor by forming heterodimers with other c/ebp members, such as c/ebp and is linked to diabetes  <cit> . expression of transcriptional activators atf <dig> and chop have been reported to be induced during er stress  <cit> . although atf <dig>  atf <dig>  and ddit <dig>  are co-ordinately expressed in response to er stress, there are differences between these genes regarding the contribution of transcriptional control and the timing of induced expression.

previous studies have shown up regulation of atf <dig> to act as either pro-inflammatory  <cit>  or anti-inflammatory  <cit> . the dimeric state of atf <dig> gives us clues as to the ultimate effects of atf <dig> on inflammation. as a homo-dimer, atf <dig> acts as a transcriptional regulator inhibiting expression of pro-apoptotic molecules. alternatively, atf <dig> can form a heterodimer with activated c-jun that enhances transcription of stress response genes  <cit> . a number of other biological molecules and pathways could contribute to the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects of tgrl lipolysis products. in this study, mrna levels of a number of inflammatory genes were markedly up-regulated in tgrl lipolysis products treated hbmvec. these genes, including il- <dig>  cxcl- <dig>  prnp and nrip <dig>  are important cytokines, which participate in inflammatory cell mobilization and recruitment. induction of plasma membrane prnp suggested that prnp interact with many other proteins and induced vascular inflammation. it was recently shown that unfolded protein response and atf <dig> are associated with inflammation response related to atherosclerosis in endothelial cells  <cit> . our previous studies have shown that tgrl lipolysis products activate stress response pathways that induce expression of multiple pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes leading to endothelial dysfunction  <cit> .

tgrl lipolysis products-induced up regulation of hdac <dig> suggested vascular inflammation in brain microvascular endothelial cells. several studies elucidated that the effects of individual hdacs in vasculature. hdac <dig> promotes angiogenesis and determines the angiogenic gene expression pattern of endothelial cells  <cit> . although hdac <dig> gene is significantly associated with large-vessel stroke risk in different population  <cit> , it’s actions are not known in microvascular endothelial cells. our study showed up-regulation of hdac <dig>  gadd45a and hmgb <dig> expression regulates cell cycle progression through p <dig> signalling by tgrl lipolysis products in hbmvec. additionally, up-regulation of rarβ and jnk, may play a role and further activate vascular inflammation and apoptosis in hbmvec. further studies are needed to validate the strength of our system biology analyses and to determine how tgrl lipolysis products regulate physiologically important cell signalling pathways. the marked increased expression of atf <dig> suggested that upstream molecules, such as tgfβ suggest that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation in hbmvec by tgrl lipolysis products is mediated through rarβ.

lipolysis of tgrl produces an array of remnant lipoprotein particles, fatty acids, phospholipids, diglycerides, and monoglycerides  <cit> . any and all of these lipids and lipoproteins could have either pro- or anti-inflammatory effects on the endothelial cells although our previous work suggest that it is the fatty acids that are the primary mediators of endothelial cell injury at high physiological or pathophysiological concentrations  <cit> . however, the broad activation of transcription factors and pro-inflammatory genes suggests that other components of tgrl lipolysis products also could be playing a part in addition to fatty acids.

the peak elevation in blood tgrl is about 3– <dig> hours after a meal and blood triglycerides can rise  <dig> -fold to many-fold higher during the postprandial period. lipolysis of tgrl by endothelial cell-associated lipoprotein lipase likewise peaks in the postprandial period thus producing more endothelial cell injury or lipotoxicity as a result of the release of tgrl lipolysis products directly on the endothelial cells. rather than low-grade, chronic injury, endothelial cells are injured repetitively over the course of a day, which could be a more pathological form of injury.

the precise pathogenetic mechanisms associated with lipotoxic neurovasclular inflammation remain to be elucidated. these experiments confirm the results of our previous work showing that high physiological to pathophysiological concentrations of tgrl lipolysis products induce brain microvascular lipotoxicity resulting in endothelial cell injury and apoptosis. these effects could alter blood–brain barrier integrity allowing not only potentially injurious lipids access to the brain, but also enabling thrombosis to occur on the injured brain endothelium causing brain microinfarctions. thus, neurovascular lipotoxicity could induce brain injury and resulting decline in cognitive function.

our microarray data and system biology analysis give us possible clues involving cell signalling pathways in hbmvec treated with tgrl lipolysis products. the systems biology approach that was taken in this study allows to identify statistically significant associations by using a consensus analysis of  <dig> different methods, as well as looking simultaneously at the transcriptional, protein-protein interaction and gene ontology networks. using a supervised interaction inference methodology that exploits the experimentally identified interactions that are known so far, is likely to increase the true positive rate of our analysis when compared to unsupervised methods. an extension to this work is looking at how information propagates through the combined gene regulatory and signal transduction networks by applied information-based methodologies  <cit> . our methodology will benefit substantially from increasing the number of biological replicates and the use of next-generation sequencing technologies  with appropriate coverage and depth, as in this study, mrna of the control and treated groups were pooled , while the confirmation by rt-pcr was done on individual samples  in each of the groups. despite this limitation, we were able to confirm approximately 50% of the genes that were predicted by our computational analyses to be implicated in this phenomenon.

CONCLUSIONS
our systems biology approach demonstrated a robust and rapid induction of genes encoding transcription factors, inflammation, and apoptosis. specifically, hbmvec treated with tgrl lipolysis products encode transcription factor atf3-related genes in the map kinase pathway associated with ap- <dig> signalling, which stimulates an array of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes that effect endothelial cell injury. these experiments confirm the results of our previous work and demonstrate the complex, parallel, and multifaceted aspects of cell signalling that high physiological to pathophysiological concentrations of tgrl lipolysis products induce in brain microvascular lipotoxicity resulting in endothelial cell injury and apoptosis. future studies are needed to show if these neurovascular pathophysiological processes are associated with the development of cognitive impairment.
