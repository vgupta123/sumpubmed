BACKGROUND
unlike many developing organs that remain dormant until the time of birth, a properly functioning embryonic heart is essential for embryo survival. hence, defects in cardiac function are a common cause for embryonic lethality. gene targeting in mice revealed multiple genes that are required for cardiac development and function; however, the interplay between these genes often remains a mystery. this is especially true for genes encoding for transcription factors which are expressed in a dynamic fashion in various cellular compartments that constitute the developing heart.

friend of gata, member  <dig> gene  is prominently expressed in multiple cell types that constitute the embryonic heart  <cit> . to examine the function for fog <dig> in cardiac development gene-targeted mice have been generated  <cit> . fog2-/-  embryos die at mid-gestation  with a cardiac defect characterized by an atrial septal defect, thin ventricular myocardium, common atrioventricular  canal and the tetralogy of fallot malformation. of particular additional interest is the finding that the development of cardiac vasculature was blocked in fog2-/- mice. despite the apparently normal formation of an intact epicardial layer and expression of epicardium-specific genes in fog <dig> null mutants, markers of cardiac vessel development  are not detected, indicative of failure to activate their expression and/or to initiate the epithelial to mesenchymal transformation of epicardial cells  <cit> . these results are particularly insightful with respect to kdr, since kdr , the major receptor for vegf , is an important marker of vascular cells and is absolutely essential for vascular development .

although gene targeting revealed the requirement for fog <dig> in multiple aspects of cardiac development, the specific genetic program  downstream of fog <dig> remained unknown. research by us and others established that multi-type zinc-finger proteins of the fog family  control biological activities of gata transcription factors . based on the results from the hematopoietic system it has been suggested that fog proteins serve as co-factors for gata family members by forming a gata/fog complex on specific gata sites. indeed, differentially regulated genes have been identified for gata1-fog <dig> complex vs. gata <dig> alone in blood development  arguing against the essential role for gata4/fog <dig> complex in their regulation  <cit> . hence, transcriptional targets of gata4/fog <dig> complex in the heart are currently unknown.

the cardiac gata4ki/ki phenotype showed numerous similarities to the fog <dig> null heart underscoring the role for gata4/fog <dig> protein complex in cardiac gene regulation  <cit> . however, the mode of gata4/fog <dig> action, as a repressor or activator, remains unclear and necessitates identification of its downstream targets. in order to identify the targets of gata4/fog <dig> action in the mammalian heart we performed several affymetrix microarray comparisons of gene expression in normal and mutant e <dig>  hearts. as many groups have identified the regions in fog proteins that mediate their function as gata co-repressors  <cit> , we expected that gene up-regulation  should be, at least partially, responsible for causing cardiac syndrome in the gata4/fog <dig> mutants.

here we describe one of the targets of gata4/fog <dig> complex in its transcriptional repressor role, lhx <dig> gene. lhx <dig> belongs to the family of the lim-hd  proteins. the roles for the majority of lim-hd encoding genes have been mostly defined in the context of nervous system development where they act to specify neuronal identities of post-mitotic neurons . lim-hd genes act in a context-dependent fashion, cooperating with other factors to establish enormous diversity of the nervous system  <cit> . the function for lhx <dig> was proposed in the development of the nervous system as this gene is prominently expressed in the motoneurons of the spinal cord and in the developing brain  <cit> . despite this prominent neuronal expression pattern, knockout of lhx <dig> in mice did not affect animal viability or neuronal development probably reflecting a redundancy of lhx <dig> and its close structural relative, lhx <dig>  <cit> ; unexpectedly, the knockout revealed a requirement for lxh <dig> in early gonad formation  <cit> . our studies demonstrate that gata4/fog <dig> transcription complex regulates lhx <dig> cardiac expression and suggest that the role for lhx <dig> in the development of the heart should be evaluated.

RESULTS
cardiac expression of the lhx <dig> gene splicing isoforms
in order to identify the targets of gata4/fog <dig> action in mammalian heart development we performed an affymetrix microarray comparison of gene expression in normal and fog <dig> null e <dig>  hearts. the microarray profiling yielded surprisingly few genes that were differentially  expressed in the mutant samples vs. controls . importantly, the probe set corresponding to the fog <dig> gene deletion was absent in the fog <dig> null sample, as was expected.

one of the probe sets differentially represented in the control vs. fog <dig> mutant rna sample corresponded to the lhx <dig> gene  encoding the lhx <dig> protein that belongs to the family of the lim-hd  transcription factors  <cit> . the major research interest of this laboratory is in the transcriptional regulation of cardiac development; hence we decided to pursue the fog2-lhx <dig> connection. to correctly evaluate the microarray data it was critical to identify the actual mrna species corresponding to the microarray oligonucleotide probe set. the ncbi database predicts three different mouse isoforms of lhx <dig> mrna; two of these isoforms have been described previously, while the third isoform has not been characterized. originally identified transcript  <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid  long protein with intact homeodomain  that is competent to bind dna  <cit> ; this isoform is further referred to as lhx9-hd. a previously described isoform, lhx9α, encodes a  <dig> aa protein with truncated hd and a different c terminus  <cit> ; finally, the uncharacterized transcript  would encode a  <dig> aa protein that has a different n-terminus in addition to a truncated hd . we will refer to the un-characterized isoform as lhx9β.

it has been reported previously that in situ hybridization using s35-labeled isoform-specific rna probes detects lhx9α expression in the developing e <dig>  heart, while the full-length hd-encoding lhx9-hd is not detected  <cit> . to corroborate and extend this data we designed the primers that discriminate between all three isoforms of lhx <dig> and performed real-time pcr analysis. by real time rt-pcr we have determined that the major lhx <dig> isoform expressed in the developing heart at e <dig>  corresponds to lhx9α, while lhx9β transcript is expressed at a somewhat lower level . cardiac expression of lhx <dig> is under strict developmental control: qrt-pcr analysis of total heart rna demonstrated that combined lhx <dig> expression corresponding to both expressed isoforms  is down-regulated between e <dig>  and e <dig>  approximately 7-fold ; during the same time period fog <dig> gene expression is increasing .

we also confirmed that a full-length isoform  is scarcely detectable in the embryonic heart even when measured by a highly sensitive real time pcr assay. the cardiac expression level of lhx9-hd is ~ <dig> times  and ~ <dig> times  lower than that of lhx9α/β; this data is in agreement with the previous work  <cit> . in contrast and as a positive control we detected lhx9-hd using the same primer pair as robustly expressed in the e <dig>  embryonic hind limb where its levels were ~ <dig> times higher than in the e <dig>  heart ; in the hind limb lhx9-hd expression was only slightly lower  than lhx9α/β expression  .

lhx <dig> is a target of the gata4/fog <dig> transcriptional complex
based on the microarray data analysis the combined value of the probe sets corresponding to lhx9α+β was ~ <dig> times higher in the e <dig>  fog2-null sample . real time pcr analysis confirmed the increase in lhx9α/β expression in the mutant. the up-regulation is already significant at e <dig>   and becomes even more dramatic  at e <dig>  . analysis with isoform-specific primers revealed that the overall increase in the mutant is derived mostly from the up-regulation of the lhx9β isoform , although expression of lhx9α in the fog <dig> mutant heart is also doubled  . the expression of the isoform encoding the full-length protein, lhx9-hd, is also induced in the fog <dig> mutant heart, but its level remains negligibly low . in contrast, the expression of the lhx <dig> homologue does not change in the mutant .

to further compare the expression of lhx <dig> in the control and fog <dig> mutant cardiac samples we performed in situ whole-mount hybridization experiments using an anti-lhx <dig> rna probe that detects both isoforms . in the wild-type e <dig>  heart the ventricles, the atrioventricular groove and the outflow tract are weakly positive for lhx9α/β expression, while in the fog <dig> null heart lhx9α/β expression is strongly enhanced . by e <dig>  and especially by e <dig>  lhx9α/β expression appears almost extinguished in the control heart, while the fog <dig> mutant sample is strongly positive for lhx9α/β . these results correlate well with the real-time pcr data . the non-cardiac expression of lhx9α/β  remains comparable in the control and mutant embryos .

lhx9α/β is localized to the epicardium in the fetal heart
to establish the identity of cardiac cells that express lhx9α/β we sectioned the stained hearts following the rna in situ hybridization. as lhx9α/β expression in the wild-type heart is low, we analyzed the mutant samples. we observed that lhx9α/β expression is restricted to the outermost layer of the heart . to ensure that this staining is not a result of a poor probe penetration, we sectioned the wild-type and mutant e <dig>  hearts and performed immunofluorescent analysis with an anti-lhx <dig> antibody. among several antibodies we have tested  only one  <cit>  was suitable for the immunofluorescence analysis of embryonic samples. in addition to lhx9α/β this anti-lhx2/ <dig> antibody recognizes both lhx <dig> and lhx9-hd; however, rna species encoding both of these proteins are absent  from the e <dig>  embryonic heart.

the antibody demonstrated strong and specific staining in all embryonic regions that were previously reported to have strong lhx2/lhx <dig> expression . in the heart the protein expression correlated well with the lhx9α+β in situ staining pattern. lhx9α/β protein expression was detected in atria, ventricles and outflow tract; the expression was enhanced in the atrioventricular groove . again, cells located in the outermost cardiac layer were the only cells that stained strongly positive for lhx9α/β. these cells  stained negative for the pan-myocardial marker, tnnt <dig> at all times examined  and data not shown).

to label the cells in the epicardial region at this early stage in epicardial development we used an antibody specific for the endothelial integral membrane glycoprotein endoglin   <cit>  that recognizes epicardial cells that are already committed to the endothelial lineage both in the control and in fog <dig> mutant hearts  <cit> . at e <dig>  the epicardial layer containing lhx9α/β-positive cells is still negative for eng, while at e <dig>  stage this endothelial marker starts to detect some  ventricular cells in the epicardial and sub-epicardial layer. we concluded that in the embryonic heart lhx <dig> α/β proteins are temporarily expressed in the developing epicardial cell layer. although the majority of the lhx9-positive cells are confined to the epicardium, a weaker immunoreactivity is detectable in the myocardium  suggesting that a low level expression of lhx9α/β could be present in these cells.

lhx9α/β and lhx <dig>  but not lhx9-hd are expressed in the proepicardium
lineage studies in chick embryos have demonstrated that epicardium is derived from the extra-cardiac source, the proepicardium  <cit> ; in mice these cells are derived  from the septum transversum  <cit> . the epicardial progenitor cell cysts are formed in the proepicardial serosa at e <dig> –e <dig>  and cover the myocardium with a single layer of flat cells by e <dig> – <dig>   <cit> . by performing an in situ hybridization for lhx9α/β with e <dig>  embryos we noted that lhx9α/β is prominently expressed in the septum transversum in both the wild-type and fog <dig> mutant embryos .

expression of the lhx <dig> homologue, lhx <dig>  in the septum transversum  has been previously reported  <cit> ; however, we noted that the authors in their analysis used a probe that corresponds to the whole-length lhx <dig> cdna . a sequence comparison revealed two large regions of almost complete identity between the lhx <dig> probe sequence and lhx9; hence, we believe the authors  <cit>  could not discriminate between lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> in their in situ assay. to distinguish between these homologues we designed an lhx <dig> probe that is limited to the most 5'-region of the lhx <dig> sequence  and has no homology to lhx9; we also generated an in situ probe that is specific for lhx9-hd. we detected an lhx <dig> transcript in the stm . in contrast, the transcript corresponding to the full-length lhx9-hd could not be detected in the stm ; this rules out the transient role for the lhx9-hd transcript in the stm. we detected no stm up-regulation of either lhx <dig> or lhx9α/β in the absence of fog2; if anything, it appears that both lhx <dig> α/β and lhx <dig> could be expressed slightly lower in the stm of fog <dig> mutants .

we have previously shown that transgenic expression of fog <dig>  extends the life of the otherwise fog2-null embryos; however this rescue by myocardial-derived fog <dig> is incomplete  <cit> . if lhx9α/β expression is mostly confined to the epicardium and directly regulated there by a fog <dig> protein, myocardially-driven fog <dig> should not be able to repress lhx9α/β expression back to its original low level. to test this we examined lhx9α/β expression in the control and 'rescued' αmhc-fog2/fog2-/- hearts at e <dig> . rescued hearts preserved a high level of lhx9α/β compared to the control indirectly attesting to the fact that myocardial fog <dig> is not primarily responsible for regulating lhx9α/β expression . this finding prompted us to examine whether fog <dig> could be directly regulating lhx9α/β expression as described below.

lhx <dig> is a direct target of gata4/fog <dig> repression complex in the heart
the loss of gata4/fog <dig> interaction leads to an over-expression  of lhx9α/β cardiac expression. based on the inability of myocardially-restricted fog <dig> to down-regulate ectopic epicardial lhx9α/β expression , we hypothesized that the lhx <dig> gene could be a direct target of gata4-fog <dig> mediated repression. to demonstrate that the repression of the lhx <dig> gene requires binding of the gata4/fog <dig> protein complex to the lhx <dig> cis-regulatory elements we inspected the lhx <dig> genomic locus using ecr  browser  <cit>  . as both lhx9α and lhx9β are expressed in the heart we examined the conserved regions corresponding to both isoforms. we limited our analysis to the ~ <dig> kb region upstream of the lhx9β transcription start site; this  <dig> kb region is delimited by the un-characterized orf  . we identified two evolutionary conserved gata sites within the annotated ecrs ; one gata site  is present within the promoter region corresponding to the lhx9α while the other site  is located upstream of both isoforms . to examine the gata4/fog <dig> complex binding to these two elements in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay from e <dig>  embryonic hearts. this time point was chosen since at e <dig>  cardiac expression of lhx <dig> is still present in the normal heart and is responsive to fog <dig> expression: lhx9α/β expression is strongly enhanced in the absence of fog <dig> . we demonstrated that either the α gata <dig> or α fog <dig> antibody specifically pulls down dna containing conserved gata sites indicating the binding of the gata4/fog <dig> complex at e <dig>  . as a negative control we have randomly chosen an internal region  that contains two perfect gata elements . this region tested negative in the gata and fog <dig> chip assays ; we have also confirmed the specificity for primers and the fog <dig> antibody by a quantitative pcr analysis of chip reactions . we conclude that in the e <dig>  heart gata4/fog <dig> complex directly binds lhx <dig> cis-regulatory regions.

gata <dig> and fog <dig> cooperate to inhibit lhx <dig> promoters
to confirm that the gata-harboring dna sequences upstream of the lhx <dig> transcriptional start sites are essential for gata4/fog2-dependent regulation we performed luciferase reporter assays. lhx <dig> regulatory sequences containing ecrs with chiped gata sites  were isolated and used to generate luciferase reporter constructs. the reporter constructs were transiently transfected into the  <dig> hek cells along with the gata <dig> and fog <dig> expression vectors. we also generated a gata4ki expression vector . the wild-type gata <dig> cooperates with fog <dig> to repress lhx <dig> promoter-driven luciferase expression while the mutant gata4ki version of gata <dig> is severely impaired in this repression assay . a luciferase construct containing a gaaa mutation in the  gata element was not co-repressed by a joint gata4/fog <dig> action . we conclude that the repression of lhx <dig> gene expression in the developing heart requires the presence of the functional gata4/fog <dig> protein complex.

lhx9α and lhx9β interact with isl <dig>  but not cited2
we established that the loss of gata4/fog <dig> interaction leads to over-expression of lhx9α/β in the murine heart. one of the consequences of the excessive lhx9α/β expression could be the 'trapping' of cardiac lhx factors with their interacting proteins into non-functional lhx <dig> α/β-containing complexes as has been previously proposed  <cit> . to further test this idea we probed the interactions between lhx9α and cardiac proteins that have been reported to interact with the lim-hd factors, namely isl <dig>  <cit>  and cited2/mrg <dig>  <cit> . the eukariotic expression vector encoding the epitope-tagged version of lhx9α was co-transfected with the epitope-tagged isl1α, isl1β or cited <dig> into hek <dig> cells and protein interactions were tested by immunoprecipitation-western  analysis. we detected the interactions between lhx9α and both iso-forms of isl <dig>  but not between lhx9α and cited <dig> . this demonstrates the ability of the lhx <dig> isoform lacking hd to form a complex with other lim-hd factors, such as isl <dig> 

isl <dig> and lhx2/lhx <dig> are co-expressed in the developing liver, but not epicardium or septum transversum
previous lineage studies in chick embryos have demonstrated that the smooth muscle of the coronary vessels derives from the proepicardium; similarly, in the mouse these cells are derived from the septum transversum. lhx9α/β is prominently expressed in the stm at e <dig>  and in the epicardium starting at e <dig>  . recent lineage tracing analysis in isl1-cre mice has demonstrated that the progeny of isl1-expressing cells contributes to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle lineages, specifically the smooth muscle of coronary vasculature  <cit> . as our ip-western analysis showed that lhx9α can interact with isl <dig>  we sought to determine whether lhx2/lhx9α/β and isl <dig> were co-expressed in the epicardium or septum transversum and performed double-fluorescence labeling experiments in e <dig>  embryos. we were unable to co-localize isl <dig> to lhx <dig> α/β-positive epicardial cells ; this data is in agreement with the reported absence of isl <dig> expression in the epicardium  <cit> . similarly, cells in the septum transversum that stained positive with an anti-lhx2/lhx <dig> antibody were also isl1-negative ; we, however, detected a subset of cells that co-express isl <dig> and lhx2/ <dig> in the developing liver . expression of lhx <dig> in the developing liver has been previously reported  <cit> .

discussion
recent evidence suggests that different splicing isoforms of the same transcription factor may have competing/opposing as well as unrelated roles in cellular differentiation . we have demonstrated that gata4/fog <dig> transcription complex is essential for the repression of lhx <dig> gene transcription in cardiac development; we have also determined that the lhx <dig> isoform encoding for the protein with intact homeodomain is not present in the embryonic heart, while both α and β isoforms encoding a truncated homeodomain are expressed. this differential expression of lhx <dig> isoforms suggests that truncated lhx <dig> proteins have a separate function independent of the full-length lhx <dig> molecule. this assertion is supported by the previously reported observation that lhx <dig> isoforms do not directly compete with each other and instead function in different pathways during neuronal differentiation  <cit> .

one of the objectives of this study was to identify the downstream targets of gata4/fog <dig> regulation in various sub-compartments of the developing heart and to understand how the mis-regulation of these targets contributes to severe cardiac defects in fog2-null and gata4ki/ki embryos. we have now determined that lhx9α/β is a target of gata4/fog <dig> repression, with wild-type hearts down-regulating lhx9α/β epicardial expression starting at least on e <dig> , while hearts deficient in fog <dig> fail to do so . the inability of the fog2-null heart to down-regulate lhx9α/β expression may be a contributing factor in the constellation of the cardiac abnormalities caused by fog <dig> deficiency  <cit> . although this study mostly focused on the fog <dig> mutants, real-time pcr analysis with the e <dig>  gata4ki/ki hearts  <cit>  also revealed a significant, albeit weaker, up-regulation of the lhx9α/β gene expression in this mutant . this more modest up-regulation in the gata4ki mutant could be due to partial compensation by the other gata family member, gata <dig>  that is expressed in the developing heart.

we also demonstrated here that lhx9α/β expression is initiated in the septum transversum  and that these are the epicardial cells that continue expressing lhx9α/β in e <dig>  hearts and downregulate this expression shortly thereafter. further experiments will confirm whether lhx9-positive epicardial cells are direct descendants of the septum transversum cells. the requirement to down-regulate lhx <dig> expression is no longer satisfied in the epicardium of the fog2-null mutant hearts . we propose that abnormally high level of lhx <dig> gene expression that is characteristic of an earlier stage in epicardial cell development is likely to be a contributing factor in the impaired differentiation of the epicardially derived cells in the fog <dig> mutant embryos  <cit> .

chromatin immunoprecipitation  confirmed the roles of the two evolutionary conserved gata sites in lhx <dig> gene cis-regulatory elements. since dna complexes were precipitating with either anti-gata <dig> or anti-fog <dig> antibodies, this assay demonstrated that in the e <dig>  heart these sites are occupied by the gata4/fog <dig> complex rather than gata <dig> alone. we could no longer detect gata4/fog <dig> complex binding to these sites in the e <dig>  hearts  suggesting that lhx <dig> repression at this later stage of cardiac development is likely to be gata4/fog2-independent. in agreement with the chip data, luciferase reporter assays confirmed the cooperative repression by gata <dig> and fog <dig> . although gata sites have been previously identified in the proximal promoters of anf, bnp and α-mhc genes, these genes' expression is not affected by the gata4/fog <dig> interaction loss. it is possible that other transcription factors regulating lhx <dig> expression ensure the selectivity of gata4/fog <dig> binding; however, computer analysis of ecrs harboring gata sites did not reveal sequence conservation for any other transcription factors in these regions. lhx <dig> gene expression is restricted to a limited number of tissues during development and is likely to be tightly regulated . transcriptional regulation of lhx <dig> is not well understood and the crosstalk between the  activators of lhx <dig> expression and its repressors, gata4/fog <dig>  remains to be elucidated. in this respect we also cannot exclude the contribution of an indirect regulation mechanism where gata4/fog <dig> would normally activate a yet unknown repressor x of lhx <dig> transcription; fog <dig> loss in this case will result in down-regulation of x and de-repression of lhx <dig>  in summary, although our chips as well as transient transfection data argues in favor of a direct repression mechanism, it is possible that, once other trans-acting factors governing lhx <dig> regulation are uncovered, they will be also deregulated in the fog <dig> knockout.

we have previously shown that transgenic expression of fog <dig> restricted to the myocardium with αmhc promoter extends the life of the otherwise fog2-null embryos; however this rescue by myocardial-derived fog <dig> is incomplete  <cit> . in this respect, increased level of lhx <dig> expression still persists in the e <dig>  hearts of the 'rescued' αmhc-fog2/fog2-/-mutants  indirectly attesting to the fact that myocardial fog <dig> is not responsible for regulating lhx9α/β expression. it is likely that the inability to down-regulate lhx <dig> in the epicardium is, at least partially, responsible for the incomplete rescue in the αmhc-fog2/fog2-/- mutants. importantly, in a sensitive qrt-pcr the level of lhx <dig> expression in αmhc-fog2/fog2-/- hearts was slightly reduced  suggesting that a low level myocardial lhx9/lhx <dig> expression is present and controlled by gata4/fog <dig> 

loss of gata4/fog <dig> interaction has a profound early effect on testis differentiation  <cit> ; similarly, the lhx <dig> gene is expressed in the developing gonads and lhx <dig> gene targeting that removes two exons encoding for the lim domains results in an early gonadal defect  <cit> . however, in contrast to the situation in cardiac development, we do not observe an up-regulation of lhx <dig> gene expression in the gonads of gata4/fog <dig> mutants  suggesting that gata <dig> and fog <dig> do not control lhx <dig> in this tissue.

currently, the function of lim-hd factors in cardiac development  is not well understood. computer analysis of gene expression database  shows that lhx <dig> is the only other member of the lhx family that is expressed in the developing heart in the amount comparable to lhx9α/β; no cardiac defect for lhx <dig> loss of function has been reported  <cit> .

our data confirms and extends the previous observation that lhx <dig> splicing isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . we also demonstrated that these truncated lhx <dig> transcripts lead to the expression of the protein; this is an important confirmation since an appearance of an rna encoding for a regulatory factor does not always correlate with protein accumulation . it was proposed that lhx9α encodes for a protein with a truncated hd that can compete with lhx <dig>  for limited amounts of nuclear clim cofactors like ldb <dig>  <cit> ; ldb <dig> knockout animals do not develop heart anlage  <cit> . clim cofactors can dimerize and interact with two lim-hd proteins at the same time . in addition to the simple sequestration of ldb <dig>  the adjustment of stoichiometry between various clim-lhx complexes can involve differential degradation of some, but not other complexes  <cit> . finally, one of the consequences of the excessive lhx9α/β-ldb <dig> complex formation could be 'trapping' of cardiac lhx factors with their interacting proteins into non-functional lhx <dig> α/β-containing complexes. our ip-western analysis demonstrated that both lhx9α and lhxβ could interact with other lim-hd proteins such as isl <dig> , suggesting that lhx <dig> α/β could function in mammalian cells as part of the multi-protein complexes. the isl <dig> protein, however, is unlikely to serve as a partner for lhx9α/β in the epicardium or septum transversum as cells expressing lhx2/ <dig> in these tissues do not express isl <dig> .

in summary, our data suggest that the function of the lhx9α/β protein during the proepicardial development should be evaluated. this function maybe masked by other lhx family members or by unrelated compensatory mechanisms and hence not revealed in the lhx9-null animals  <cit> . we also provide evidence that gata4/fog <dig> regulate lhx <dig> gene expression directly through binding to the evolutionary conserved gata sites in the lhx <dig> regulatory regions. the loss of gata4/fog <dig> interaction leads to de-repression of the lhx9α/β expression in epicardial cells; this abnormally high expression may account for some of the cardiac malformations observed in the gata4ki/ki and fog <dig> null mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
lhx <dig> belongs to the family of the lim-hd  transcription factors. we have now determined that the developing mouse heart normally expresses truncated isoforms of lhx <dig> – lhx9α and lhx9β. whereas, the expression of the lhx <dig> isoform that encodes a protein with an intact homeodomain is extremely low. at e <dig>  lhx9α/β expression is prominent in the epicardial primordium, septum transversum; in the e <dig>  heart lhx9-positive cells are localized to the epicardial mesothelium. thereafter in the control hearts lhx9α/β epicardial expression is promptly down-regulated; in contrast, mouse mutants with fog <dig> gene loss fail to repress lhx9α/β expression. chromatin immunoprecipitation from the e <dig>  hearts established the roles of the two evolutionary conserved gata sites in lhx <dig> gene cis-regulatory elements. in transient transfection studies the expression driven by the cis-regulatory regions of lhx <dig> was repressed by fog <dig> in the presence of intact gata <dig>  but not the gata4ki mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind fog <dig>  this study identifies the first direct target for the gata4/fog <dig> repressor complex in the heart, lhx9α/β.
