BACKGROUND
in the past decades, the prevalence of candidemia has increased significantly. among them, candida albicans is the most frequently isolated fungal pathogen in humans and has caused morbidity in seriously debilitated and immunocompromised hosts. coinciding with the increased usage of antifungal drugs, the incidences of drug resistance have also increased  <cit> .

overexpression of cdr <dig>  an atp binding cassette  transporter, has been shown to be the major mechanism for the drug resistance of clinical isolates  <cit> . mutations on cdr <dig> in c. albicans have resulted in an increased susceptibility to azole drugs  <cit> , which is consistent with the observation that overexpression of cdr <dig> contributes to the drug resistance of clinical isolates of c. albicans  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of cdr <dig> is increased approximately 4-fold in catup1/catup <dig> mutant cells, which are predominately in the hyphal form  <cit> . this data suggests that catup <dig> acts as a negative regulator of cdr <dig>  recently, two transcription factors, candt <dig> and catac <dig>  have been identified as positive regulators of cdr <dig> in c. albicans  <cit> .

previous works have demonstrated that biological fluids such as human serum can have profound effects on antifungal pharmacodynamics  <cit> . during an infection, the c. albicans cells exist in the host body and are surrounded by blood and other body fluid, where they encounter the antifungal drugs. in this study, we have found that the wild-type sc <dig> cells but not the cdr1/cdr <dig> mutant cells became more susceptible to fluconazole, a commonly used antifungal drug, when the medium contained serum. to investigate the regulation of cdr <dig> in the presence of serum, we have constructed a cdr <dig> promoter-renilla luciferase gene  reporter to monitor the activity of cdr <dig> promoter in c. albicans under different conditions. in conclusion, serum increases the drug susceptibility by repressing the expression of cdr <dig> 

RESULTS
to determine if serum has any effect on the drug susceptibility of c. albicans, we have determined the growth of cells in the presence of different concentrations of fluconazole and in the absence or presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. the wild-type cells but not the cdr1/cdr <dig> mutant cells became more susceptible to fluconazole when the medium contained serum . the growth of the wild-type cells was less inhibited by  <dig>  mg/l fluconazole in serum-free medium than that in serum-containing one . the minimum inhibitory concentration  of fluconazole of the cdr1/cdr <dig> mutant cells  was lower than that of the wild-type cells . this is consistent with the previous reports that mutations on cdr <dig> have resulted in an increased drug susceptibility  <cit> . the mic of fluconazole of the wild-type cells was 2-fold lower in serum-containing medium than that in serum-free one .

it is generally accepted that overexpression of cdr <dig> is the major mechanism for the drug resistance of clinical isolates  <cit> . our finding that the wild-type cells but not the cdr1/cdr <dig> mutants became more susceptible to fluconazole in serum-containing medium led us to further investigate the effects of serum on cdr <dig> expression. first of all, we have constructed a cdr1p-rluc reporter . the construct was integrated into the cdr <dig> locus and its activities under different conditions in different strains were determined. the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  the c. albicans cells containing cdr1p-rluc were harvested after being grown in synthetic dextrose  liquid medium in the absence or presence of  <dig> mg/l of miconazole at 35°c for one hour. the expression of cdr1p-rluc was induced approximately 2-fold by miconazole . this datum is consistent with the previously report that the expression of cdr <dig> is induced by miconazole  <cit>  and also suggests that the activity of cdr1p-rluc can refer the expression of cdr <dig> under our experimental setup.

to determine the effect of serum on the expression of cdr <dig>  we have measured the activities of cdr1p-rluc in c. albicans cells that were grown in sd liquid medium in the absence or presence of 10% fetal bovine serum at 35°c for one hour. surprisingly, the serum repressed the expression of cdr1p-rluc. in the presence of the serum, the expression of cdr1p-rluc was reduced to 50% of that in the absence of the serum . to determine if human serum also has the same effect, we have also cultured the cells in the presence of 10% human serum from two healthy volunteers. interestingly, like the fetal bovine serum, the human sera also reduced the expression of cdr1p-rluc .

this datum suggests that if the activity of cdr1p-rluc echoes the expression of endogenous cdr <dig>  the level of cdr <dig> mrna would be reduced when c. albicans cells were grown in the presence of serum. to investigate this hypothesis, we have measured the level of cdr <dig> mrnas in different strains by real-time pcr. in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, the level of cdr <dig> mrna in the wild-type cells was reduced to approximately 50% of that in the absence of the serum , which re-assured the result of the activity assay with cdr1p-rluc. these results conclude that serum represses the expression of cdr <dig>  since serum is a key stimulant for hyphal formation of c. albicans, we would like to determine whether its effect on cdr <dig> expression is due to a factor solely present in serum or common in other hypha-inducing media also. consequently, we have determined if  <dig> mm n-acetyl-d-glucosamine , a known inducer for germ tube formation of c. albicans would alter the expression of cdr <dig>  <cit> . unlike serum, glu-nac did not have effect on the expression of cdr <dig> . this result suggests that the expression of cdr <dig> is not repressed by every hypha-inducing medium. this is consistent with the previously reported that the expression of cdr <dig> is increased in catup1/catup <dig> mutant cells, which are predominately in hyphal form  <cit> .

recently, candt <dig> has been identified as a positive regulator of cdr <dig> in c. albicans  <cit> . to investigate if serum represses the expression of cdr <dig> via candt <dig>  we have also determined the level of cdr <dig> in candt80/candt <dig> mutant cells. the expression of cdr <dig> was reduced 50% by the null mutation of candt <dig> , which is consistent with our previous finding that candt <dig> regulates cdr <dig> positively  <cit> . if regulating the expression of cdr <dig> by serum is independent of the activity of candt <dig>  the level of cdr <dig> mrna in the candt80/candt <dig> mutant cells would be significantly reduced in the presence of serum. otherwise, it will not . our data showed that although 10% fetal bovine serum further reduced the expression of cdr <dig> in the candt80/candt <dig> mutant cells, the effect was mild .

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that the wild-type cells became more susceptible to fluconazole when the medium contained serum. furthermore, the expression of cdr <dig> is repressed significantly by serum according to the activity of the reporter and cdr <dig> mrna level. the level of cdr <dig> mrna was only mildly reduced by serum in the candt80/candt <dig> mutant cells suggesting the major, if not the sole, regulatory ability of serum may be through the activity of candt <dig>  however, we still can not rule out the possibility that serum may also act through tac <dig> and/or other unidentified regulators. it will be interesting to investigate the coordination between candt <dig> and tac <dig> in regulating the expression of cdr <dig> in the presence of serum.

the standard antifungal susceptibility testing  <cit> , which is conducted in the absence of serum, is unreliable in predicting the clinical outcome of therapies, especially for systemic infections. our finding may explain the existence and persistence of such a discrepancy between the susceptibilities of in vivo and in vitro environments.
