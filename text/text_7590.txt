BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells, the tightly packed chromatin contained in the nucleus directs fundamental cellular processes. the regulation of chromatin conformation by specific structural proteins and their post-translational modifications have a major influence on transcription, repair, replication and recombination  <cit> . histones are important for chromatin organization and their residues are constantly targeted by modification enzymes. one of the modifications implicates acetylation of specific lysine residues in core histones . by its ability to remodel chromatin, histone acetylation influences the transcriptional state of chromosomal regions by controlling the accessibility of underlying genes, directly linking this regulatory mechanism with gene activation  <cit> . acetylation of histones is also involved in the deposition of free histones onto newly synthesized dna  and in the replacement of histones by protamines  <cit> . because histone acetylases  and deacetylases  are associated with crucial regulatory roles, their dysregulation is often involved in diseases such as cancer  <cit> .

hats are divided into  <dig> families: gcn5/pcaf , p300/cbp  and myst. among these families, myst is more divergent and not as well characterized. this protein family is also different with regard to domain organization, multiprotein complex formation and biological function  <cit> . myst is an acronym of its four founding members: human moz , yeast ybf <dig> , yeast sas <dig>  and mammalian tip <dig>   <cit> . myst <dig>  also called moz <dig> or morf , is a member of the myst family  <cit> . in vitro studies demonstrated that it preferentially acetylates free histones h2a, h <dig> and h <dig>  as well as nucleosomal h <dig> and h <dig>  alternative splicing variants are found , but their expression, impact and function remain uncharacterized. the name myst <dig> is now attributed to the longest of the splicing variant, morfβ. the sequences composing some of myst4's domains are similar only to one other myst family member, moz. both moz and myst <dig> are involved in leukemogenesis  <cit> . chromosomal abnormalities found in leukemia patients reveal that myst <dig> is rearranged and fused with the cbp gene  <cit> , a translocation also associated with moz  <cit> . additionally myst <dig> can interact with runx <dig> , a recurrent leukemia associated target  <cit> . in the mouse, its homologue querkopf is thought to be implicated in cell differentiation in the cerebral cortex by regulating chromatin organization at some point during transcription. the malformations found in the cerebral cortex of mutant querkopf mice reveal that the gene is essential for normal embryonic neurogenesis  <cit> . its involvement in gametogenesis and early embryogenesis is unknown, however preliminary mrna studies revealed that myst <dig> transcripts are present in high amounts in bovine oocytes  compared to other hats  <cit> .

many members of the myst family have distinct domains and diverse functions, including roles in epigenetic control, transcriptional regulation, dna replication, dna repair, chromatin assembly, cell cycle progression and cellular signalling . it has been suggested that myst <dig> may also perform some of those functions, although since it has unique domains it may act differently from other myst members  <cit> . structural features found in myst <dig> suggest that it could be a hat with novel properties. however, most functions and characteristics attributed to myst <dig> remain hypothetical and are only based on sequence analysis. the lack of proteomic and more thorough in vivo data are due to the absence of a functional myst <dig> antibody.

in the study presented here, our aim was to characterize bovine myst <dig> and the combination of all myst <dig> splicing variants simultaneously  in various tissues, but more specifically in reproductive tissues and gametes. the transcriptional study revealed that myst <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in bovine somatic tissues. unlike its mrna, the myst <dig> protein was present in some, but not all, of the eleven somatic tissues tested. in addition, myst <dig> could be linked with important events that take place during folliculogenesis, embryo development, and spermatogenesis. myst <dig> mrna levels were assessed in oocytes and embryos, as were protein expression and localization. valuable information was additionally obtained with the localization and expression of myst <dig> protein in the ovary and testis.

RESULTS
myst <dig> sequence
using polymerase chain reaction on oocyte cdna, we obtained an amplified fragment of approximately  <dig> bp . sequencing revealed that it corresponded to the full-length bovine myst <dig> gene. this splicing variant is the longest of the three myst <dig> isoforms and encoded  <dig> amino acid residues . the three splicing variants contained exactly the same sequences, except that morf and morfα are  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa shorter than myst <dig>  . alignment analysis also revealed that conservation between human and bovine myst <dig> was nearly 95%. the human myst <dig> sequence has  <dig> more amino acids, which can be found almost entirely in two glutamic acid-rich areas located in its acidic region. bovine myst <dig> contains various structural domains throughout its coding sequence. the most homologous domains were similar to those found in other proteins such as linker histones h1/h <dig>  phd zinc fingers and myst histone acetylases . additionally acidic and ser/met-rich regions were found. a transcriptional activation domain was also present in the c-terminal sequence of myst <dig> 

myst <dig> mrna in somatic tissues
we assessed the presence of transcripts for myst <dig> and for all myst <dig> isoforms simultaneously  by rt-pcr analysis in different bovine tissue samples, including brain, thymus, muscle, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, testis, ovary, uterus and oocyte. the three splicing variant sequences were similar except for the gap present in morf and morfα compared to myst <dig>  which was restrictive for designing primers. individual analysis using the different sets of primers for the splicing variants resulted in no or nonspecific amplification of morf and morfα, therefore they could not be investigated. amplicons of expected sizes were generated for myst <dig> and all-myst4-iso, as well as for the housekeeping gene tubulin . the mrna transcripts for myst <dig> and all-myst4-iso were present in all tissues tested. although this was not a quantitative analysis, the amplifications for the thymus, spleen, testis and uterus gave more intense bands with the same amount of cycles/cdna compared to the other samples with both the myst <dig> and all-myst4-iso primers. however, the amplifications from the oocytes samples were amongst the most intense with the all-myst4-iso primers, whereas they were ones of the lowest detected with the myst <dig> primers.

myst <dig> protein in somatic tissues
in order to characterize the distribution of myst <dig>  an antibody was raised against a peptide specific only to myst <dig> and its isoforms. the same tissues that were used for mrna transcript analysis were subjected to western blotting. as shown in fig.  <dig>  one positive protein band of about  <dig> kda associated to myst <dig> was predominantly present in the lung, spleen and ovary, whereas the same protein was also present but faintly detected in the brain, testis, uterus and oocytes. in the heart a single sharp band of about  <dig> kda was detected. this protein is presumably the morf isoform, which has a calculated molecular weight of  <dig> kda. peptide-blocking assays established that our myst <dig> antibody was specific for the myst <dig> peptide used for antibody production since the single distinct band disappeared . β-actin was used as a loading control, but since some tissue extracts lacked this specific isoform, the samples were additionally probed with an anti-tubulin antibody.

myst <dig> immunohistochemistry in ovary
since our western blot experiments revealed that only a portion of the strong myst <dig> signal in the ovary was associated with oocytes, immunolocalization experiments were performed on ovary sections to distinguish which other cell types expressed myst <dig>  in these tissue sections, myst <dig> expression was confined to follicles and to blood vessels, as there was no other signal within the stroma. a closer look at primordial follicles  revealed that myst <dig> was intensely expressed in the cytoplasm of the oocyte, whereas the nucleus remained negative. myst <dig> was also present in the cytoplasm of the simple squamous epithelium layer surrounding the oocyte, while cells in the proximity of the follicle wall were negative. in larger follicles, like those at the antral stage, granulosa cells adjacent to the oocyte and those covering the inside of the follicle strongly expressed myst <dig> . the oocytes contained within these follicles displayed myst <dig> in both their cytoplasm and nucleus . in large follicles myst <dig> was not only present in granulosa cells, but also on the other side of the basal lamina, in the theca cells . while essentially all granulosa cells expressed myst <dig> in their cytoplasm, only a portion of theca cells expressed myst <dig>  within the theca cell population positive for myst <dig>  the majority displayed a strong signal for this protein in their nucleus, however a faint signal was also observed in some cell cytoplasm. additionally ovary sections revealed that cells composing blood vessels also expressed myst <dig> in their cytoplasm .

myst <dig> mrna profiles in oocytes and embryos
the mrna profiles for myst <dig> and all myst <dig> isoforms  were assessed in oocytes and throughout bovine in vitro embryo culture by quantitative rt-pcr. the myst <dig> variant and all-myst4-iso exhibited a similar overall mrna profile in oocytes and throughout early embryo development . the highest relative levels of myst <dig> mrna were found in immature gv and mature mii oocytes. transcript levels measured in the oocyte stages as well as in the 2- and 4-cell stages did not differ significantly, but a significant reduction was observed in the 8-cell embryos. the relative mrna levels were lowest in 8-cell, 16-cell and morula embryos but tended to increase in blastocysts .

the relative levels of all-myst4-isoforms were also at their highest intensity in both oocyte stages studied . thereafter, significant decreases were observed in 2-, 4-, 8- and 16-cell embryos. the transcript levels for the combined isoforms were lowest in 16-cell and morula embryos. these minimal levels were subsequently followed by a significant increase in transcripts at the blastocyst stage.

myst <dig> immunocytochemistry in oocytes and embryos
to evaluate the localization of myst <dig> protein in bovine oocyte and embryo, immunolocalization experiments were performed on unfertilized bovine oocyte and throughout in vitro embryo development . the immature oocyte strongly expressed myst <dig> in its germinal vesicle  and uniformly in its ooplasm . as the oocyte resumes its maturation, the gv breaks down  and no nuclear membrane is noticeable at the metaphase i  stage of meiosis. at that moment, myst <dig> was not present on the chromatin but appeared to concentrate on the mitotic spindle and scattered in the ooplasm . in the in vitro matured oocyte , myst <dig> remained present throughout the ooplasm and along condensed chromosomes , but the first expulsed polar body did not reveal any staining . during the subsequent cleavage stages, in 2-, 4-, 8- and 16-cell embryos, myst <dig> was clearly expressed in the cytoplasm . however, nuclear localization during that period in blastomeres was not as obvious compared to gv oocytes. compact morula embryos exhibited a similar myst <dig> expression profile in the cytoplasm and nucleus . in early and expanding blastocysts, myst <dig> was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells composing the trophectoderm and inner cell mass . however, the staining intensities of the nuclei were not similar, with some showing strong signal whereas it was weaker or absent in others . for all stages, negative controls were performed with a peptide-blocking assay, of which an example is shown .

myst <dig> immunohistochemistry in testis
to establish if myst <dig> expression in testis could also be restricted to specific cell types, testis sections were immunostained with the myst <dig> antibody . in the first cross-section , myst <dig> was only present in some seminiferous tubules whereas others did not show any staining. this strongly suggests that its expression is developmentally regulated and is stage-specific during spermatid differentiation . myst <dig> appeared to localize in cells facing the lumen of the seminiferous tubules and was cell-specific during spermiogenesis. to investigate this hypothesis, seminiferous tubules at different stages of spermatogenesis were closely observed . the spermatid differentiation process in bovine is divided in  <dig> described steps that include round , elongating  or elongated spermatids   <cit> . these various spermatids, from steps 1– <dig>  are distributed in a specific manner within the seminiferous tubules . the seminiferous tubules are also divided into classes, called stages , accordingly to the seminiferous epithelium cycle. additionally, diverse types of germ cells  are distributed inside the different stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle  <cit> . in seminiferous tubules containing primary spermatocytes and round spermatids , which correspond to stage vii of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, no myst <dig> was detected. however, in seminiferous tubules cross-sections at stages viii to xi, intense staining of the myst <dig> protein was detected in elongating spermatids . at higher magnification, the image clearly revealed that only the heads , and not the mid-sections, of elongating spermatids were stained by myst <dig> antibody . in this section , myst <dig> immunolocalization was clearly restricted to elongating spermatids, as no spermatocytes were stained. further along spermatogenesis, in stages iv to vi of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, the elongated spermatids displayed no immunoreactivity to myst <dig> . the elongated spermatid nuclei located on the inner wall facing the lumen as well as those inside the lumen were negative for myst <dig> .

discussion
as a result of its unique structural domain organization as well as its presence in various multisubunit complexes  <cit> , myst <dig> is probably involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes. although it is established that myst <dig> is a potent histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylase  <cit> , the functional consequences of this enzymatic activity remain unknown. its specific function as a hat remains ambiguous, but its involvement in chromosomal abnormalities found in leukemia patients  <cit>  and its normal presence in neurogenesis development have already been established  <cit> . in this paper we aimed to characterize myst <dig> and the combination of all myst <dig> isoforms simultaneously  in various tissues, but more specifically in reproductive tissues and in gametes.

based on its sequence, the bovine myst <dig> protein is highly similar to its human counterpart, with almost 95% homology. bovine myst <dig> contains the same structural domains that make myst <dig> so unique and therefore we can assume that bovine and human myst <dig> take part in the same cellular processes.

expression of myst4
a previous report revealed that human morf is ubiquitously expressed in somatic tissues  <cit> . transcript levels were high in tissues like heart, pancreas, testis and ovary, whereas they were barely detectable in the lung. in our study, we determined that the mrna transcripts for the myst <dig> gene as well as for all myst <dig> isoforms were also ubiquitously present in all tissues tested, with different intensities.

because the mrna transcripts for the different splicing variants were present in each tissue tested, we thought they would parallel the protein levels. however, myst <dig> protein detection was quite variable in the same tissues, ranging from high  to undetectable . surprisingly, only one of the tissues  revealed a specific band with a different molecular weight compared to the other tissues. protein extracts from the heart displayed only one band which may be the shortest isoform, morf.

myst <dig> in female gametogenesis
oocytes also expressed the myst <dig> protein, albeit weakly, and thus could not account for the important levels found in the ovary extracts, suggesting that other cell types could express myst <dig>  immunolocalization on ovary sections confirmed this by revealing that myst <dig> was expressed in follicular cells  enclosing the oocyte, as well as in blood vessels. although this is the first time that the myst <dig> acetylase is associated with folliculogenesis, various acetylation events occur within granulosa and theca cells during follicle formation and growth. numerous experiments using chip  assays on these cells revealed that specific histone acetylation events in the promoter region of ovarian genes are affected by the increase in reproductive hormones . in vitro culture of rat granulosa cells treated with fsh  enhances the transcriptional activation of the sgk  and the fos  genes by increasing the acetylation of specific lysine residues on histone h <dig>  <cit> . in addition, granulosa cells obtained from monkeys treated with hcg and from human ivf  patients also treated with hcg exhibited histone h <dig> acetylation in the regulatory regions of the star  gene  <cit> . furthermore, inhibition of hdacs in cultured human theca cells increased total histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation levels, along with mrna transcription for cyp11a  and cyp <dig>   <cit> . given that the myst <dig> proteins are restricted to certain specialized cells in the ovary and have a strong histone h3/h <dig> acetylation activity, they could regulate the transcription of specific genes during folliculogenesis. the functions of myst <dig> in follicular cells may be somewhat distinctive since the protein is mainly nuclear in theca cells and cytoplasmic in granulosa cells. dormant oocytes enclosed in primordial follicles also lacked myst <dig> in their nucleus, but the oocytes contained in the larger follicles exhibited myst <dig> in both cytoplasm and nucleus. since dormant oocytes are deficient in transcription at this point  <cit>  they may not require this hat in their nucleus for regulatory processes, whereas growing oocytes are in a transcriptionally active state and thus necessitate enzymes responsible for chromatin remodeling.

related mrna profiles in oocytes and throughout embryo development were observed between myst <dig> and all-myst4-iso. however, since higher levels of transcripts were measured with the all-myst4-iso in oocytes compared to the subsequent embryo stages, whereas myst <dig> was equally present in the first four stages, we assume that the splicing variants morf and/or morfα are more abundant in the gv and mii oocytes compared to other embryo stages. globally, a significant amount of all-myst4-iso transcripts was lost following each embryo division up to the 16-cell stage, followed by a slight increase in mrna levels between morula and blastocyst embryos. high levels of transcripts in oocytes could be mrna accumulated during oocyte growth and translated into protein in subsequent stages of development until the embryo is able to produce its own mrna at the met . however the immunolocalization study, although not quantitative, revealed that similar intensity of staining for cytoplasmic myst <dig> was found throughout development. this could indicate that the protein has an extensive half-life or the transcripts produced by post-met embryos are constantly being translated into new proteins and do not accumulate. interestingly, gv oocytes contained the largest measured levels of myst <dig> transcripts and had the highest accumulation of the protein in its nucleus. since there is still some active transcription in gv oocytes  <cit> , myst <dig> may potentially be implicated in this permissive chromatin state by co-regulating transcriptional complexes via its transcriptional activation domain. surprisingly, during oocyte maturation when chromosomes are lined up along the equator at the metaphase- <dig> stage, myst <dig> was located in the vicinity of the meiotic spindle rather than on chromosomes. interaction with chromatin is expected, since myst <dig> contains a h1/h <dig> domain that mediates self-association and interaction with core histones and the nucleosomes  <cit> . because there is no nuclear membrane during mi in meiosis, there was no barrier to retain myst <dig> at this location. therefore it may be implicated in the meiotic spindle action to separate the chromosomes or in other related mechanisms. it is unlikely that it acetylates histones h <dig> and h <dig> at that point, since histones are globally deacetylated in oocytes during meiosis  <cit>  and improper histone deacetylation in the course of meiosis is associated with aneuploidy and embryo death  <cit> . alternatively, the α-tubulin proteins composing the microtubules could perhaps be a target for myst <dig>  since they are acetylated at different points in meiotic and mitotic divisions in mouse oocytes  <cit> ; however, no studies have yet examined if myst <dig> could acetylate α-tubulin. although myst <dig> appeared to be present in the nucleus from the 2-cell until the 16-cell stage embryo, no major accumulation was observed in the nucleus. in the morula and blastocyst stages, some nuclei appeared to have the same accumulation as that observed in oocytes. this nuclear accumulation may be associated to specific stages in the cell cycle and since there are more individual cells in those embryos, the chances of detecting this accumulation are increased. the presence of myst <dig> in the nucleus also coincides with the activation of specific genes involved in the delineation of the blastocyst inner cell mass and trophectoderm  <cit> .

myst <dig> in male gametogenesis
since myst <dig> was linked with reproductive cells in the ovary, we wondered if its presence in testis could have a similar function. surprisingly, in this organ, myst <dig> was restricted to specific cells. the antibody brightly stained only the nucleus of elongating spermatids found in stages viii to xi of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, which normally enclose step- <dig> through - <dig> spermatids  <cit> . the spermatid differentiation process in bovine is divided in  <dig> described steps that include round , elongating  or elongated spermatids   <cit> . the adjacent seminiferous tubules of the same testis section, containing spermatids at different stages of development, were not immunoreactive. because there are various nuclear modification events that occur during spermiogenesis, myst <dig> may be a key player in one of them. in the nucleus of elongating spermatids at different stages, important acetylation processes occur to ensure proper histone displacement for their replacement by transition proteins and protamines  <cit> . during these processes, different residues of the core histones  are targets for acetylation. in mouse spermiogenesis, there are  <dig> reported steps, with steps  <dig> to  <dig> associated with the elongating spermatids  <cit> . acetylation of histone h <dig> is limited to steps  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas histone h <dig> is hyperacetylated from steps  <dig> to  <dig>  for both h <dig> and h <dig>  the intense staining seems homogeneously distributed over the nuclear region. furthermore, the four potential sites of acetylation on histone h <dig>  were individually studied with specific antibodies and revealed to be all immunoreactive in steps  <dig> to  <dig> of the elongating spermatids  <cit> .

other acetylation events on histones h2a  and h2b  are also observed in elongating spermatids. to date, the only genes thought to be associated with histone h <dig> hyperacetylation in elongating spermatids prior to the histone-to-protamine exchange are all members of the cdy -related family  <cit> . in the mouse, where two transcripts evolved for that gene, both cdyl  and cdyl <dig> exhibit a ubiquitous, long transcript as well as a highly abundant, testis-specific short transcript  <cit> . in human, members include the cdyl and cdyl <dig> genes which are ubiquitously express in tissues, and cdy which is an abundant testis-specific gene  <cit> . cdy and its homologs encode a hat that acetylates free histones h <dig> and h2a  <cit> . by immunolocalization, it was shown that mouse cdyl is abundantly expressed in the nuclei of elongating spermatids at the time histone h <dig> is hyperacetylated  <cit> . although our immunolocalization experiments were not performed on individual elongating step sections, we could clearly distinguish that myst <dig> was also only present in elongating spermatids during spermatogenesis. furthermore, myst <dig> is not only able to acetylate free h2a, h <dig> and h <dig> when used as substrates, but can efficiently acetylate nucleosomal histones as well  <cit> . with the new data obtained in our study added to previous reports on myst <dig>  strong evidence connects this protein with h2a, h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation during spermiogenesis. however, because some of the histone modifications mentioned above are also present at some other stages like spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes, histone acetylases other than those of the cdy and myst <dig> families are likely to be involved in spermatogenesis.

myst <dig> in vivo characteristics
although myst <dig> was discovered several years ago, it has never been linked to the formation of a stable multisubunit hat complex. recently, myst <dig> and its close relative moz  were characterized as part of a histone h <dig> specific hat complex important for dna replication  <cit> . this hat complex also includes a member of the tumor suppressor family , proteins usually associated with chromatin  and an uncharacterized protein homologous to a subunit of a yeast acetyltransferase . since this complex was only able to acetylate h3k <dig> in hela cells  <cit> , it is unlikely to be involved in the acetylation of h <dig> in spermatids. however, transcripts from related brfp family members are preferentially expressed within spermatocytes in the testis  <cit>  and in oocytes  <cit> , suggesting that brfp proteins may be present and associated with myst <dig> in other hat complexes.

although myst <dig> knock-outs are not yet available to determine whether the gene is essential in reproduction or other important processes, a mutant mouse for its homolog querkopf exists. the homozygous querkopf mice display about 10% of the normal coding mrna compared to wild type  <cit> . these mutant mice show craniofacial abnormalities, retarded postnatal growth, defects in the central nervous system  <cit>  and severe problems in adult neurogenesis  <cit> . these physiological failures are caused by the essential function attributed to querkopf in neural stem cells  <cit>  and in bone formation through its involvement with runx <dig>  <cit> . because there is still partial expression of wild-type querkopf mrna, these mice are still able to develop despite all their defects. however for the moment, no information about other malformations or problems in folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis or embryo development was reported for the homozygous mutant mice. even though myst <dig> and moz interact in different protein complexes, they specifically regulate diverse stem cell populations  <cit> . through its complete deletion in mice, moz revealed itself as an essential regulator of hematopoietic stem cell maintenance  <cit> . compared to the querkopf or myst <dig> mutants, moz-null mice die before or at birth.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here reveals novel properties for the histone acetylase myst <dig>  the data and conclusions from bovine myst <dig> will undoubtedly apply to the human protein since both sequences show extensive similarities. in addition to providing the first proteomic study of this poorly studied protein, this is the first report to link myst <dig> with early gametogenesis. to our knowledge, myst <dig> is the only hat to be described in cells  related to gamete formation in both male and female. the availability of a highly specific and functional antibody will now allow the use of techniques such as pull-down assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation, to identify protein complexes and isolate chromatin target sites associated with myst <dig> in transcriptional regulation events in reproductive tissues and other specific cell types. this antibody will also provide a new tool to study the implication of myst <dig> in acute myeloid leukemia .
