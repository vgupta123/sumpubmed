BACKGROUND
genetic variations in the dopamine  system have been related to nutritional indices  <cit>  and a nomadic lifestyle  <cit> . while human neurological, behavioural and physiological genetics is a vast field, little such research has been conducted among people living in non-industrialized or subsistence environments. such environments may be more similar to the environments where much of human genetic evolution took place; indeed, they may be adaptively relevant environments  for the evolution of dopamine gene polymorphisms that have been primarily investigated in industrialized settings. here we examine the relationships between genetic polymorphisms of dopamine receptor genes and several phenotypes in ariaal men.

the ariaal are traditionally nomadic pastoralists living in northern kenya. they are mainly a subsistence population with low percent body-fat and chronic under-nutrition  <cit> . roughly half of our sample consists of nomads, while the other half are from a group that has been settled for about  <dig> years and practices some agriculture  <cit> . this contrast between nomadic and settled ariaal groups provides an opportunity to test for gene by environment interactions across two environments inhabited by genetically and culturally similar peoples. we examine how two dopamine receptor genetic polymorphisms relate to measures of nutrition/body composition among these two groups. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine correlates of dopamine genetic variation in a subsistence society.

dopamine gene polymorphisms and their correlates
this study analyzes the correlates of two genetic polymorphisms, the taqi a polymorphism in the dopamine receptor d <dig>  gene and the  <dig> base pair  repeat polymorphism in the dopamine receptor d <dig>  gene. there is evidence that minor alleles of both drd <dig> and drd <dig>  decrease the sensitivity and/or concentrations of their respective receptors  <cit> . thus, minor alleles can be viewed as analogous to their respective dopamine receptor antagonists , and thus provide natural experiments to dissect aspects of human physiology. drd <dig> and drd <dig> are both considered d2-like receptors and have similar functions and distributions, but are distinct. drd <dig> seems to be particularly important in the striatum, whereas drd <dig> appears more important in the prefrontal cortex . both are likely involved in impulsivity, reward anticipation and addiction and they may interact in a complex manner to effect phenotypes .

the drd4/ <dig> bp polymorphism has been associated with body mass index  and food craving  <cit> . the allele frequencies of drd4/ <dig> bp vary considerable across populations and the 7r minor allele is generally at a higher frequency in populations that have migrated farther or are nomadic rather than sedentary  <cit>  and among individuals with multi-racial ancestries  <cit> . it appears that the 7r allele emerged and began being positively selected for about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> .

the a <dig> allele of the drd2/taqi a polymorphism has often been associated with substance abuse  <cit> . the drd <dig> gene has also been variously related to bmi and related indices of metabolic syndrome  <cit> . lower striatal d <dig> receptor availability has been related to obesity and increased bmi  <cit> . those with drd <dig> a <dig> alleles have higher food reinforcement  and consume more food than their counterparts without a <dig> alleles  <cit> , suggesting drd <dig> impacts nutritional status through food craving behaviour.

increases in height have been reported among children who were exposed pre- or post-natally to d <dig> receptor blocking drugs . additionally, among four independent sets of subjects drd <dig> polymorphisms were related to height  <cit> .

predictions and findings
based on past research suggesting that bmi associations with dopamine receptor polymorphisms are due to increased food craving  <cit> , we expected that bmi would be related to dopamine receptor genotype. however, food craving in western environments of plenty might have very different implications than among undernourished ariaal men. based on observations that nomads around the world have higher drd4/7r allele frequencies relative to settled populations  <cit> , we predicted that 7r+ nomads would have better relative indices of nutrition than 7r+ settled ariaal.

we compared allele frequencies between the settled and nomadic men, but due to the settled group's recent formation  <cit>  and continued gene flow with the nomads, we did not have clear expectations for allele frequency differences.

we also expected that drd <dig> would be associated with height as shown in previous research. since height is a key variable in calculating bmi and drd <dig> and drd <dig> are functionally related, height was examined in relation to both drd <dig> and drd <dig> 

we found that bmi was higher in individuals with one or two 7r alleles in the nomadic population, but was lower in settled individuals with the 7r allele. post-hoc analysis suggests that these drd4-related differences in bmi were mainly due to differences in fat free mass. height was unrelated to dopamine genetic polymorphisms.

RESULTS
allele and genotype frequencies in nomadic and settled men
drd <dig> allele and genotype frequencies are shown in table  <dig>  settled and nomadic ariaal did not differ in their 7r allele frequencies  nor were there significant differences in overall allele frequencies . the drd <dig> genotype frequencies of the settled and nomadic ariaal pooled together were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium  as well as in the nomads alone . the drd <dig> genotype frequency among settled ariaal was slightly out of hwe , but when the single 5r/5r individual was excluded from the analysis, hwe was maintained . no 2r alleles, the third most common and likely functionally distinct allele, were found in either the nomadic or sedentary samples; consistent with a lack of 2r alleles in some other african populations  <cit> . drd <dig> allele and genotype frequencies are shown in table  <dig>  the drd <dig> genotype frequencies of the settled and nomadic ariaal pooled together was in hwe  as well as for the settled  and nomadic groups separately .

body composition/nutritional status
descriptions of the anthropometric variables used in this study, including bmi and height, are given in table  <dig> for the pooled population and two sub-populations. the nomadic and settled groups of men that make up the sample are on average underweight, having bmis below the  <dig>  standard of normal-weight  <cit> . general linear models to evaluate the relation of drd <dig> and drd <dig> with anthropometrics first included drd <dig>  drd <dig>  residence and all two-way interactions and then, in a separate model, included variables shown in past studies to be associated with the anthropometric measure of interest  <cit> . as can be seen in models  <dig> &  <dig> of table  <dig>  a strong interaction between drd <dig> and residence with bmi was evident. the nature of this interaction between drd <dig> and residence is illustrated in figure  <dig>  where among nomads 7r+ was related to being less underweight , but among settled men, 7r+ individuals were more underweight .

Φ detailed statistics for models  <dig> and  <dig> are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

height did not show the predicted association with drd <dig>  nor was height associated with drd <dig> . closer examination of the only other study specifically testing for an association between drd2/taqi a and height suggests that the a <dig> allele may differ in its linkages in different populations. in that study, idiopathic short stature was associated with a <dig> alleles in japanese subjects  <cit> . increases in height have been reported among children who were exposed pre or post-natally to d <dig> receptor blocking drugs . however, the a <dig> allele of the drd2/taqia polymorphism is generally associated with decreased drd <dig> functioning/expression , so together with the d <dig> receptor blocking studies, we should expect a <dig> alleles to be associated with increased  height. since the a <dig> allele is not thought to be a functional polymorphism in the dopamine system , varying genetic background  could explain varying results across populations.

since bmi is a coarse measure of body composition we conducted further post-hoc analysis in an effort to understand the associations of drd <dig> with body composition at a finer level. we analyzed upper arm muscle area plus bone area  because it represents short term energy balance/storage  <cit>  and low values of ampba in the elderly are associated with increased mortality  <cit> , triceps skinfold  as a measure of energy stores and current energy balance  <cit> , percent body fat  as a measure of general adiposity, fat free mass  as another measure of body size, and suprailliac skinfold  as a measure of abdominal fat, thought to be the most metabolically active fat depot  <cit> .

ampba might be associated with drd <dig> and drd <dig> through interactions with residence, although the effect significance depends on the other covariates in the models . nomads with 7r alleles had higher ampba, whereas little or no difference was found in settled individuals . based on an expectation of similar effects of drd <dig> and drd <dig> minor alleles, it is peculiar that the drd <dig> a1+ genotype was near significantly associated with decreased ampba among the nomads . perhaps this can be understood as effects of drd <dig> on gh and igf- <dig> mediated muscle formation  <cit>  or maintenance  <cit> . however, such an explanation of drd2's effect on ampba is not consistent with our suggested explanation for the lack of association of drd <dig> with height.

in models 7– <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> , we show that tsk, %bf and ssk were not related to drd <dig> or drd <dig> genotypes. however, models  <dig> &  <dig> , show a relatively strong association between the interaction of drd <dig> and residence with fat free mass . inclusion of additional relevant covariates increases the significance of this interaction and the explanatory power of the model . the direction of the association with ffm  was the same as with bmi ; nomads with 7r alleles had higher ffm than their nomadic counterparts without 7r alleles, and the effect of drd <dig> was reversed and of a lesser magnitude among the settled. since ffm has previously been shown to vary with age group , we additionally checked for drd <dig> by age group and drd <dig> by residence by age group interactions, but these were not evident .

drd <dig> 7r+ seems to increase total non-fat mass  of the body, but only among nomads. ffm is defined as bodyweight minus body-fat weight and thus primarily measures the sum of the masses of muscle, bone, and organs. with this exclusion of fat mass, ffm represents the more metabolically active body portions  <cit> . ffm is a general index of body-size and in a chronically underweight population, can reasonably be assumed to represent greater body-size and/or greater muscular and bone mass. however, given the lack of association of drd <dig> with height, the latter suggestion of increased muscle and bone mass seems more likely. in an undernourished population with low % body fat , increased muscle and bone mass might actually represent less starvation induced breakdown of muscle mass and higher nutrient stores   <cit> .

the finding that the 7r allele had a positive association with bmi, ffm and ampba among nomads, but a negative one among settled individuals is consistent with past findings of higher 7r allele frequencies in nomadic populations around the world  <cit> . while dopaminergic pathways clearly are involved in food craving , the significance of increased food cravings is unclear in a nutrient poor environment, where food to satisfy such cravings is not readily available. that 7r alleles are associated with selfishness  <cit>  might also mean that while craving food more those 7r men are also less likely to share food. however, it is unclear why food craving or selfishness should vary in its outcome by residence among the ariaal.

hiv infection, common in kenya, can cause wasting. past study among the ariaal suggest low rates of condom usage and a cultural acceptability for men to have multiple simultaneous sexual partners  <cit> . sexual behaviours have been related to drd <dig>  <cit>  which might alter sexually-transmitted disease risks. however, information on hiv infection rates among the ariaal is not available.

increased impulsivity, adhd-like traits, novelty-seeking like traits , aggression  <cit> , violence  <cit>  and/or activity levels  <cit>  may help nomads obtain food resources, or exhibit a degree of behavioural unpredictability  <cit>  that is protective against interpersonal violence or robberies  <cit> . increased activity levels, if not resulting in increased food access, likely would decrease nutritional stores. the 7r allele might also promote better infant survival  <cit>  depending upon the social and ecological context. alternatively, these associations may represent some other more basic metabolic influence of drd <dig>  such as regulation of physical activity in high temperature environments  <cit> . regardless of the mechanism, the fact that the drd <dig> 7r allele remains at relatively low frequency  despite indications that it contributes to improved somatic condition among nomads, suggests that the 4r/7r polymorphism is maintained by frequency dependent selection  <cit>  .

we recognize that both drd <dig> and drd <dig> genotypes are sometimes parsed differently than shown here. to allow further analysis and comparisons with other studies, we have included the complete dataset used for this manuscript as additional files  <dig> & <dig>  as well, full statistics, effect sizes and observed power for models  <dig> and  <dig> from table  <dig> are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
the drd <dig> gene was not associated with height in this non-industrialized group – at variance with four previous studies. we note that the taqi a polymorphism is itself not know to be functional , so this finding could be due to differences in genetic linkage by population. re-sequencing or more extensive haplotype analysis of this region in this and other populations might elucidate the matter. alternatively, population specific epistatic interactions or the chronic undernutrition experienced by the ariaal men in this sample might alter the relative expression/importance of drd <dig> genotypes in determining height.

we found that drd <dig> 7r+ genotypes were associated with indices of better nutritional status among nomads, particularly higher fat free mass, but worse indices in the settled individuals. this suggests that the 7r allele confers additional adaptive benefits in the nomadic compared to sedentary context. these benefits might be derived from behavioural or metabolic differences between genotypes that vary either in their physiological/psychological phenotypic expression or practical result by context. future study will be required to distinguish between potential mechanisms involved.

in order to elucidate the current finding, future studies among the ariaal might look more specifically at food intake, attention in children, mechanisms of defence of livestock and/or activity levels. it might be that the attention spans conferred by the drd4/7r+ genotype allow nomadic children to more readily learn effectively in a dynamic environment , while the same attention span interferes with classroom learning in songa, the settled community. 7r+ boys might develop into warriors  and men who can more effectively defend against livestock raiders, perhaps through a reputation of unpredictable behaviour that inspires fear. among 7r+ men in the settled community of songa, such tendencies might be less well suited to practicing agriculture and selling goods at market. it might also be that higher activity levels in 7r+ nomads are translated into increased food production, while such activity levels in settled men are a less efficient use of calories in food production.

this study highlights the importance of studying human biology, and genetic polymorphisms in particular, in diverse environments and among genetically distinct populations.
