BACKGROUND
tick infestation, tick-borne diseases  and tsetse-transmitted trypanososmosis
constitute are the major problems in livestock production in the sub-saharan africa
 <cit> . tbd,
namely, east coast fever, anaplasmosis, babesiosis and cowdriosis have been reported
to affect the optimal livestock productivity in east african region  <cit> . for example, tick-borne
diseases constitute over 72% of the annual cattle mortality in tanzania
 <cit> . apart
from acting as vectors for diseases , ticks have been recognized as important
ectoparasites of livestock. they are bloodsuckers, causing local necrosis which
results to low-quality hides  <cit> , secondary
bacterial infections  <cit> , lowered
productivity in terms of weight gain  <cit>  and
milk yield  <cit> . studies have shown that ticks
of the genera rhipicephalus and amblyomma which are the most
important in tbd transmission are distributed in almost all cattle keeping areas in
tanzania  <cit> .
furthermore, the cost of tick control and tbd treatment is increasingly becoming a
problem to livestock industry of tanzania  <cit> . notably, in  <dig> tanzania spent up to  <dig>  million us$ on
tick and tbd control  <cit> , while the total
annual national loss inclusive of cattle mortality was estimated to be  <dig> million
us$  <cit> . therefore, because of the immense
financial pressure tbd puts on the national livestock productivity, it is imperative
that the stakeholders cooperate in designing and recommending effective control
strategies for better performance of the industry. acaricide treatment is the most
commonly used method for control of tick-borne pathogens in the tropics
 <cit> .

according to pegram  <cit>  the intensive use of
acaricides to control ticks is no more advocated except for “highly productive
pure-bred bos taurus dairy cattle”. it is recommended by the
“report of the fao expert consultation on revision of strategies for the
control of ticks and tbds ” that the best
method to control or limit the impact of ticks and tbds is the enzootic stability
which can be achieved by different means. however, the approach to ticks and tbds
control by enzootic stability sounds good but may not apply in tanzania because the
prevalence of ticks and tbds and their associated losses are still very high
 <cit> . in
1970s and 1980s the tanzania government used to subsidise acaricides to farmers but
later was stopped because of economic crisis. many farmers stopped from dipping
their animals which lead to an alarmingly increase of the prevalence of tick-borne
diseases and their associated losses. currently, the ministry of livestock
development in tanzania advocates the use of acaricides as the cornerstone means for
tick and tick-borne diseases control in the country. other means of tick control
like hand picking, pasture burning, rotational grazing and many others are also
encouraged though their practicability still not promising.

the use of acaricides for tick control in tanzania has a long history. since the
construction of the first dip tank at mpwapwa in  <dig>   <dig> dip tanks and  <dig> spray
races had been constructed all around the country  <cit>  but most of them are now dilapidated. the most commonly
used acaricides were the organochlorines such as lindane, dieldrin, aldrin,
cyclodiene and toxaphene. due to unacceptable persistence in the environment, tick
resistance and chronic toxicity to mammals and birds, the organochlorines were
replaced by organophosphates and pyrethroids  <cit> . for example, tick resistance to lindane and
dieldrin in 45% out of  <dig> strains from  <dig> different tick species in  <dig> regions of
tanzania has been reported  <cit> . unlike
organochlorines, the organophosphate compounds are chemically unstable and
non-persistent to the environment  <cit> . the
common organophosphates which have been on use in tanzania include ethion,
chlorpyrifos, chlorfenvinphos and coumaphos. however, there have been reports of
organophosphate resistance, associated with prolonged use, incorrect strength or
wrong concentration of the acaricide  <cit> .

on other hand, synthetic pyrethroids like cypermethrin, deltamethrin and cyhalothrin
have been reported to be more effective against ticks in the tropics  <cit> . these chemicals are favoured over organochlorine because
of their efficacy, inherent short half-life and inability to persist in the
environment  <cit> . the introduction of
synthetic pyrethroid preparations in tanzania such as deltamethrin  <cit> , cypermethrin  <cit>  and alpha-cypermethrin  <cit>  which have the ability to control both ticks and tsetse
flies is a welcome cost-effective development. among the synthetic pyrethroid
preparations available in the markets are the pour-on preparations, which can be
used on individual animals or smaller groups of animals, as well as in areas where
water is scarce and where dipping and spraying facilities are not available. since
tbds is a major problem therefore, it is necessary to document the efficacy and the
associated cost benefit of pour-on preparation of synthetic pyrethroids as a tick
control alternative in extensive grazing system where most needed. this study was
thus aimed to determine the intensity of tick infestations in tshz reared in
extensive grazing systems. furthermore, to assess the efficacy of
ecotix®  pour-on preparation and
cost implications for control of ticks in mvomero district in tanzania.

methods
study location
the study was conducted at mkula and melela villages located in the arid areas in
southern part of mvomero district. the two villages were conveniently selected
because most of the inhabitants were maasai pastoralists who use the extensive
grazing systems. the villages were easily accessible and had large herds of
cattle that had not been dipped for the past ten years. dipping was not done
because of the following;  breakdown of the dip tanks,  water scarcity
and  high costs of tick control due to cessation by the tanzanian
government to provide free acaricides to farmers. the important economic losses
though not quantified which were incurred by farmers due to tick infestations
and tbds included high morbidity and mortalities, reduced production and
reproduction performance in cattle .

mvomero district is located between 8–10º s and 28–37º e in
the morogoro region, tanzania. the district varies greatly in topography and
climate. highlands and lowland rainforest are located in the northwest and
central-north belt respectively, while the drier woodlands are located in the
south. rainfall distribution in the district is bimodal, with a long wet season
from march to may and a short wet season from october to december. the dry
seasons in mvomero district are experienced for six months . the northern area has a humid to sub-humid
climate, and annual rainfall ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> mm while the southern part
of the district is much drier, with annual rainfall of up to  <dig> mm. average
annual temperatures in mvomero district ranges from 20– <dig> °c. the
study was conducted for four weeks during dry season  of  <dig> 
during periods of dry seasons, the tick infestations associated with tbds in
mvomero district are relatively higher as compared to rainy season .

study cattle herds
the study animals were the tanzanian short horn zebu , which were managed
under extensive grazing system. four herds located at a distance of about
10– <dig> km apart, were conveniently selected from the study villages . the selection criteria were based on the owners’
willingness to participate in the study. the selected herds had an average of
 <dig> cattle per herd. all the adult animals in the herds were qualitatively
examined for the tick infestation. each animal was examined for presence of
ticks on the head, ears, neck, belly, back, legs, perineum and tail. preliminary
identification of ticks  was done while the
ticks were still attached on the animal body. presence of one or more ticks on
an animal was recorded as a positive case.

quantitative analysis of tick infestation
after the animals were examined for presence of ticks,  <dig> adult cattle from each
herd were selected for quantitative tick assessment and subsequently were used
in the ecotix® treatment trials. the animals were selected based
on the following criteria:  had many visible ticks on the skin ,  the age was one year and above,  had a
weight range of  <dig> to  <dig> kg and,  there was no history of application of
acaricide. animals with the stated criteria were ear tagged and separated from
the rest in each study herd except the control group . a total of 40
animals were selected and allocated in treatment regimes groups 
according to their herds of origin. the  <dig> animals in each of the treated groups
 were separated from the rest and were being grazed separately
during the day time but kraaled with rest of the animals in the herd during the
night. the experimental animals in all the four groups were being grazed in
terrain of pasture of similar characteristics since the interval from one study
village  to the other  was almost  <dig> –  <dig> km which did not
give any significant differences in climate and general weather conditions.
animals in txrg  <dig> and  <dig> were from the herds in mkula village while those in
group  <dig> and  <dig> were from melela village. all the selected animals were female
 since cows constituted more than 95% of the animals in the study
herds.

for quantitative tick assessment, individual animals in each group were
restrained, cast down and examined for ticks. each animal was examined by
thorough checking and where required combing, all the body regions beginning
from the head and ears, followed by the neck, belly, udder, back, limbs,
perineum and tail. quantitative examination of each animal involved tick
counting on the whole body  <cit> . with the aid of portable magnifying lens, adult
and immature ticks on the animals were preliminary physically identified  as described by soulsby  <cit>  and walker et al.  <cit> . after the preliminary field identification of
ticks  <cit> ,
further identification in the laboratory using a sterio microscope was done. a
maximum of 2– <dig> ticks for each identified category were collected and
stored separately in tubes of ethanol 70%. the samples were sent to the
laboratory at faculty of veterinary medicine, sokoine university of agriculture
for microscopic confirmation. morphological and structural characterization of
ticks was carried out using a stereoscopic microscope with the aid of
identification guides of soulsby  <cit> 
and walker et al.  <cit> . the identified
ticks were not separated based on sexes and location of attachment on the body
of an animal.

ecotix® treatment and monitoring of the animals
the selected  <dig> animals  were involved in the
ecotix® pour-on preparation 
treatment trials. ecotix® contains  <dig> % of high-cis cypermethrin
active ingredient. the treatment trial was conducted as described by sajid et
al.  <cit>  with some modifications. in
txrg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> animals were treated with ecotix® according to
manufacturer instructions while animals in txrg  <dig> were treated with water
. briefly, ecotix® was applied
along the spinal from the head to the tail at the recommended dose . day  <dig> was the day that the cattle were first examined for tick
infestation and ecotix® was applied to the animals in groups
txrg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the acaricide was applied on day  <dig> for txrg  <dig>  days  <dig> and  <dig> for
group  <dig> and days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for txrg  <dig>  tick load in the control group was
monitored along-side with the treatment txrg. tick load on animals was
quantitatively monitored through physical counting on the whole body
 <cit> .
tick infestation was monitored in the control and treatment groups for a period
of  <dig> days as from day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  number of ticks and
effectiveness of treatment duration, was calculated from the data for each
group.

data analysis
the prevalence of ticks was determined using the following formula  <cit> :

 prevalence%=number of existing cases during specified time
periodx100populationatriskduringthatspecifiedtimeperiod 

population at risk during that specified time period

the data was entered in microsoft excel® spreadsheet. after
validation the data were then transferred to stata  for statistical analysis. a mean tick count in
box graph plot was used for graphical analysis. because of differences in the
number of ticks that were observed on animals on day  <dig> in different groups,
before plotting, all means for tick counts were normalized by computing
percentage of number of ticks counted relative to tick counts on day  <dig> in each
group. a robust poisson regression model was used to show the effect of the
different treatment regimes on the total tick count.

ethical considerations
the permission to carry out this study was granted by the morogoro municipal
livestock officer and ethical approval for the study was given by the ethical
committees of sokoine university of agriculture . verbal
consent was obtained from each of the participating heads of households after
explaining the purpose and importance of the study prior to commencement of the
experiments.

RESULTS
tick infestation in cattle
all the examined animals  from the  <dig> study herds were infested with
different species of ticks. however, not all the tick species identified, were
present in all the animals. the tick species identified on the animals are shown
in table  <dig>  the most predominant identified tick species
was the brown ear tick rhipicephalus appendiculatus. other identified
tick species included a. variegatum, r.  microplus , r.  decoloratus , r. evertsi evertsi and r.
compositus. the overall mean  tick density was 63
±  <dig> ticks per animal with a count range between  <dig> and  <dig>  the mean tick
count on day  <dig> between the animal txrg was as follows:  <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±
 <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> for groups one, two, three and four
respectively. 
experiment

results on ecotix® treatment trial
the post-treatment quantitative assessment of tick burden revealed that untreated
animals  maintained a tick infestation throughout the study
period with a slight increase recorded on day  <dig> and  <dig> but later normalized
. the number of ticks in the control group  average remained constant. following application of ecotix®
pour-on preparation on day  <dig> in txrg  <dig>  tick count decreased from 100% to 5%, in
txrg  <dig>  the tick counts decreased from 100% to 4% while in txrg  <dig>  the tick
counts decreased from 100% to 10% by day  <dig> . 
groups  and txrg  <dig> is the control group.
ecotix® was applied on day  <dig> for txrg  <dig>  days  <dig> and
 <dig> for txrg  <dig> and days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for txrg  <dig>  tick counting was done on
day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the results are presented as
percentage of change in tick counts from day  <dig> to  <dig>  note that the tick
counts in the control group  on average remained constant. as a
post ecotix® application effects on day  <dig> in txrg  <dig> 
tick count decreased from 100% to 5%, in txrg  <dig>  the tick counts
decreased from 100% to 4% and in txrg  <dig>  the tick counts decreased from
100% to 10%. the second dosage on day  <dig> in the txrg  <dig> and txrg 4
dramatically reduced the total tick count in these two groups compared
to the txrg  <dig>  spontaneously, the tick loads in txrg  <dig> and txrg 4
started to increase as noted on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of counting. no
difference in the total number of tick between the txrg  <dig> and txrg  <dig> 
represents treatment days.

since all the three test regimes; single treatment , double treatment
 and triple treatment  received the same initial concentration
of ecotix® pour-on preparation, the fall in tick count had the
same characteristic but the count at day  <dig> was different since these groups had
a different total tick count at day  <dig>  the second dosage on day  <dig> which was
applied to the double and triple treatment regime groups had a dramatic
reduction in the total tick count between these two groups 
compared to the single treatment regime group  . the mean tick count was 2% and 3% for groups txrg  <dig> and txrg 4
respectively. spontaneously, the tick loads in txrg  <dig> and txrg  <dig> started to
increase as noted on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of counting. this spontaneous
increase seemed not to be affected by the third ecotix® which
was applied on day  <dig> txrg  <dig> group. furthermore, given that all the four groups
had different total tick number at day zero, a robust poisson regression was
used to eliminate that effect. it was found that there was no significant
difference on total tick number when double  and triple 
ecotix® treatments were compared . however, a significant difference  was observed when single
vs double treatment and single when compared to triple treatment .

economic analysis of ecotix®
during the high tick challenges, the manufacturer recommends a regime of three
times applications of ecotix® pour-on to cattle per month. based
on the quantitative treatment trials, a simple economic evaluation which applies
for these geographical settings was computed extrapolating the analysis to all
six months of dry season which has a relatively high tick challenge is described
below: doses of  <dig> ml of ecotix® pour-on applications per  <dig> kg
body weight are required. the average weight of the tshz that met our selection
criterion for study inclusion weighed  <dig> kg, so  <dig> ml would be needed in a
month making a total of  <dig> ml per animal during the  <dig> months of dry season. the
current selling price of  <dig> ml bottle of ecotix® in tanzanian
shillings  is  <dig>  000=  so each ml costs 40
shillings and the cost per animal during the six months of heavy tick
infestation would be  <dig> = . from our findings, if txrg  <dig> is used,
only  <dig> ml of ecotix® would be used per animal per six months
costing  <dig>   <dig> shillings. in economic terms, the farmer saves tshs  <dig>  600/=  per animal per six months by adopting double ecotix®
application per month . note that this
economic analysis applies only in areas like southern parts of tanzania
including mvomero district which have similar climatic conditions and tick
challenges especially during the dry season.

discussion
this study demonstrates that different species of single and multi-host tick species
were prevalent in the tshz cattle which were managed under extensive system. the
study shows five different species of ticks, which were predominated by r.
appendiculatus, a well-known vector for theileria parva which
causes east cost fever in cattle. r. appendiculatus inhabits a wide range
of east african environments  <cit>  and has
been recorded from different parts of the tanzania mainland  <cit> . the favourable climatic
conditions for survival and multiplication are cool moist places, but it can
tolerate relatively arid conditions as in case of many areas inhabited by
pastoralists in tanzania. branagan  <cit> 
reported that presence of favourable temperature, humidity, rainfall and appropriate
hosts as important factors for the endemicity of r. appendiculatus in a
locality. almost all the above listed factors are favourable in morogoro and this
may account for r. appendiculatus predominance. predominance of r.
appendiculatus may also be due to the fact that cattle are widely believed
to be the primary host for this tick  <cit> . the other species, a. variegatum
, r. microplus  r.  decoloratus
 and r. evertsi evertsi  occurred at a relatively low numbers suggesting that
they are less abundant under field conditions. our findings on the general spectrum
of ticks were similar to those of other authors in tanzania  <cit> . considering previous studies on tick infestation in
domestic ruminants and results of current study, unless adequate and sustainable
tick control measures are put in place, tick infestation will remain the main
drawback to livestock industry in tanzania.

furthermore, studies reports that there is a co-existence between the geographic
distribution of r.  decoloratus, a. variegatum and r.
appendiculatus, in the absence of tsetse or any other barrier to cattle
distribution, r.  decoloratus and a. variegatum tend to be
centered on the same foci as r. appendiculatus <cit> . the
reason behind can be both the climate and host factors for their survival and
multiplication. generally, the tick challenge recorded during this study could be
attributed to the more conducive conditions for tick proliferation, survival and
lack of tick control programs in most pastoralist communities in tanzania
 <cit> .

lack of tick control measures on animals grazed in infested areas and the poor animal
husbandry practices may be other factors for the observed high tick loads. moreover,
the limited scope of awareness regarding the impact of ticks, non existence of
acaricide uses and lack of adequate veterinary infrastructure for access by pastoral
society in the area may also account for the widespread existence of tick species in
the area. this high prevalence of ticks predisposes the animals to tbds which would
ultimately lead to losses due to reduced productivity and increased animal
mortality. indeed, a study by swai et al.  <cit>  in maasai pastoralists in tanzania reported that tbds were
the main cause of low productivity and cattle mortality. however, some authors
 <cit>  believe that animals which are not treated with
acaricide in tick infested endemic areas tend to achieve an endemic stability to
tbd, where adult cattle acquire immunity against subsequent haemoparasitic
infections and severe diseases only occur in calves and young animals. in reality,
this may not be practical and needs more research. for cowdriosis, babesiosis and
anaplasmosis, a high tick challenge and high prevalence of tbds are actually the
conditions allowing the setting up of the enzootic stability. however, some
researchers are not sure that such enzootic stability can prevail for ecf, because
of the very high pathogenicity of the disease in cattle including the local breeds.
since r. appendiculatus, the vector of ecf was the main tick in the
examined herds, this could prevent the setting up of enzootic stability. indeed, a
study by silayo et al.  <cit>  reported that in
absence of acaricide use in cattle kept under extensive grazing system in tanzania,
calf mortalities due to tbds in particular ecf can reach up to 80%. calves are
infected naturally with haemoparasites within four weeks of birth and in the absence
of acaricide application, their health status decline severely and succumb to high
mortality rates  <cit> . in addition, in absence of routine use of acaricides,
increased morbidities, reduced production and reproduction performance associated
with high mortalities in adult cattle has also been reported in different places
 <cit> .

therefore, the results of present study warrant for immediate tick control measures.
the frequent use of efficacious acaricides as a control measure may avert major
cattle losses through deaths and loss of productivity which were reported by the
farmers during the study period. also, there should be an effort to educate the
famers about the significance of the tick infestations and the best approach to
control measures.

according to the tanzania ministry of agriculture  <cit> , an acaricide is considered to be adequate when its
efficacy is 95% or higher. ecotix® as a pour-on preparation showed
that it has high acaricidal effects as it had cleared off almost 95% of the wide
range of hard multi-host ticks in cattle in the period of  <dig> days post-treatment.
the second treatment  which was applied in txrg 3
and txrg  <dig> gave more better results as it further reduced the tick loads from 20%
and 19% to almost 2% and 3% respectively. this lead to our conclusion that repeated
treatment of ecotix® to cattle at two weeks interval gives a more
better results in controlling ticks as it showed a significantly low tick loads
compared to single treatment. however, the spontaneous decrease in tick count
observed in txrg  <dig> which had received single ecotix® could not
warrant recommending a single treatment and this needs further investigations. the
observed slight decrease of tick load in txrg  <dig> post third ecotix®
treatment and thereafter a spontaneous increase of tick count as from day  <dig> to 10%
by day  <dig> could be not be accounted for but may be caused by extent of tick
challenge and management factors. generally, these results are also in agreement
with work done by msolla  <cit>  who found that
ecofleece, a 10% w/v cypermethrin preparation was 99% effective in the control of
both single and multi-host ticks up to two weeks post treatment. similarly, mbise et
al.  reported that alpha–cypermethrin controlled
significantly both the immature and mature ticks. elsewhere, bicalho et al.
 <cit>  reported that the high
cis-cypermethrin had a 75% inhibition of r. sanguineus eggs from hatching
while it had 100% larval, nymphal and adult tick mortality. we therefore recommend
the use of ecotix® pour-on preparation in the routine control of
ticks and tbds in tanzania.

furthermore, the study found that ecotix® a pour-on preparation was
able to control ticks by double treatment per month different from the three
treatment recommended by the manufacturer. for economic reasons, double treatment is
cost effective for control of ticks. the high-cis cypermethrin are reported to have
a persistent effect and are generally considered to be an improvement over other
insecticides relative to their environmental impact when applied at insecticidal
doses  <cit> .

economically, with double treatment regime of ecotix® a pour-on
preparation, the farmer can save up to  <dig>  usd per animal per each six months of dry
season when the extent of tick infestation is relatively high. based on the common
average herd size of up to  <dig>  owned by a pastoral household in tanzania, the
farmer may save up to  <dig>  usd in six months of dry season.

CONCLUSIONS
from the findings of this study, it is concluded that cattle in mkula and melela
villages in mvomero districts were infested with different species of ticks at
varying intensities. a  <dig> % high-cis cypermethrin pour-on showed high efficacy
against tick infestations in tshz cattle managed under extensive system in this
area. furthermore,  <dig> % high-cis cypermethrin preparation can be applied to cattle
grazed under extensive management system twice per month at two weeks interval
rather than thrice per month as recommended by the manufacturer. with this
ecotix® treatment regime, the farmer is able to save  <dig>  usd per
animal during the six months of dry season.
