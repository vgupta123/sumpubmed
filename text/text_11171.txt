BACKGROUND
microsatellites are short segments of dna in which a specific motif of 1– <dig> bases is repeated  <cit> . due to their high polymorphism, codominant inheritance, ease of scoring and dense distribution throughout eukaryotic genomes, microsatellites are now generally considered to be the most powerful genetic markers for genetic mapping and evolutionary studies  <cit> . one perceived difficulty with microsatellites is the long lead time in identifying and characterizing microsatellites in new taxonomic groups. this problem is alleviated by developing novel protocols for enriching repeat dna from genomic dna  <cit> . however, most microsatellites are type ii markers for which no known function has been established. type i markers are associated with genes of known functions and are more useful for comparative gene mapping to study genome evolution  <cit>  and for identifying markers associated with important quantitative traits  <cit> . although snps in genes were identified in some fish species  <cit> , type i markers are still relatively rare in fish. detection of polymorphic microsatellites located within transcribed genes provides a possibility to convert type ii markers to type i markers  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that some microsatellites with genes were associated with economically important traits  <cit> , and could be used as markers for marker-assisted selection. currently, microsatellites in transcribed genes have been identified in model organisms  <cit>  and economically important animal  <cit>  and plant species  <cit>  by data mining in ests using bioinformatics tools or direct sequencing ests. however, in most of  <dig>  fish species existing on the earth  <cit> , it is difficult to obtain microsatellites in cdna through data mining, due to the fact that no ests are available, or the number of ests is limited in these species. although a method for enriching microsatellites from genomic dna has been adapted to identify microsatellites from cdna in catfish  <cit> , the efficiency of isolation of microsatellites in cdna is still not very high as comparing that in genomic dna  <cit> , due to the redundancy of cdna. in this paper, we report a very simple and efficient method for isolating microsatellites from transcribed genes. the method included cdna normalization, microsatellite enrichment and directional cloning of cdna enriched with microsatellites.

RESULTS
in a previous study  <cit> , we sequenced  <dig> ests from six normalized cdna libraries of asian seabass . from the  <dig> ests, a total of  <dig> unique sequences containing microsatellites  from  <dig> clones were identified. among the  <dig> microsatellites,  <dig> were ca-repeats,  <dig> ga-repeats, two gga-repeats and three other types of repeats. these data indicate that unique microsatellite sequences accounted for  <dig> %  of cdna clones in asian seabass. ca- and ga-microsatellites were most abundant in cdna of asian seabass. however, they represent only  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of cdna clones from normalized cdna libraries. hence, straightforward random sequencing of clones from normalized cdna libraries is not efficient for discovering microsatellites.

in this study, we tried to enrich ca-, ga-microsatellites from unnormalized cdna of asian seabass using biotinylated  <dig> and  <dig> oligonucleotides, since these two types of microsatellites are most abundant in cdna of asian seabass. two cdna libraries were constructed, one enriched for ca-microsatellites and another for ga-microsatellites. from each library,  <dig> randomly picked clones were sequenced in both directions. among the  <dig> clones from the cdna library enriched for ca-repeats,  <dig> clones contained microsatellites. of the  <dig> clones containing microsatellites, only  <dig> were singletons, and the remaining  <dig> were included in  <dig> clusters. a total of  <dig>  unique microsatellites were obtained from the  <dig> sequences clones . similarly, among the  <dig> sequenced clones from the cdna library enriched for ga-repeats,  <dig> clones contained microsatellites. eight were singletons, and  <dig> were included in  <dig> clusters. the cdna sequence of the parvalbumin gene beta- <dig> containing one ct-microsatellites  <cit>  appeared  <dig> times in the  <dig> clones. a total of  <dig>  unique microsatellites were obtained from the cdna library enriched for ga-microsatellites. in comparison to the random sequencing of clones from normalized cdna libraries without enrichment of microsatellites, the efficiency of microsatellite isolation from unnormalized cdna libraries enriched for microsatellites has been raised over  <dig> times . in catfish, similar efficiency of isolation of microsatellites from cdna was reported  <cit> . however, high redundancy of cdna sequences from unnormalized cdna libraries reduced the efficiency of microsatellite isolation from cdna.

in order to increase the efficiency of enrichment of microsatellites, we tried to reduce the redundancy of cdna by normalizing cdna using duplex-specific nuclease   <cit>  before enrichment of ca- and ga-microsatellites . after cdna normalization, redundant cdna were removed . two normalized cdna libraries, one enriched for ca-microsatellites and another for ga-repeats were created. from each library,  <dig> clones were sequenced in both ends respectively. eighty-eight  and  <dig>  clones of the  <dig> clones from the normalized cdna libraries enriched for ca- and ga-repeats respectively, contained microsatellites . the redundancy of clones was substantially reduced. in the  <dig> clones containing microsatellites from the cdna library enriched for ca-microsatellites,  <dig> were singletons, the remaining  <dig> were included in  <dig> contigs. a total of  <dig>  unique microsatellites were obtained from  <dig> sequenced clones. in the  <dig> clones containing microsatellites from the cdna library enriched for ga-repeats,  <dig> were singletons, and  <dig> were included in  <dig> clusters. a total of  <dig>  unique microsatellites we obtained from  <dig> sequenced clones . in comparison to the efficiency of microsatellite enrichment from unnormalized cdna, the efficiency was about three folds increased by using normalized cdna . therefore, decreasing the prevalence of clones representing abundant transcripts before microsatellite enrichment by normalization of cdna is essential for microsatellite isolation from cdna. the normalization of cdna using dsn was very simple and highly efficient in comparison to other cdna normalization methods  <cit> . the whole procedure of microsatellite enrichment starting from normalization of cdna lasted only  <dig> days. application of this method to isolate microsatellites from cdna of grass carp brain got similar results . therefore the method is robust and reproducible.

sixty of  <dig> microsatellites isolated from the libraries enriched for ca- and ga-microsatellites had enough flanking regions for designing primers, and were characterized in a panel of  <dig> individuals previously used for characterization of microsatellites isolated from genomic dna  <cit> . forty-one were polymorphic with an average allele number of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> , whereas the average expected and observed heterozygosity were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively. the average allele number of microsatellites isolated from cdna is slightly lower than those isolated from genomic dna libraries, and characterized with same dna panel  <cit> , which might be due to the relatively lower number of repeats of microsatellites identified from cdna. examination of genotyping errors using microchecker revealed no evidence for large-allele dropout or stutter-band scoring at any of the  <dig> loci. all  <dig> polymorphic microsatellites showed a mendelian pattern of inheritance. twenty-nine of  <dig> microsatellites were in hwe . departure from hwe at  <dig> loci may be caused by the presence of null alleles. however, examination of genotypes using microchecker showed the possibility of presence of null alleles is low . therefore, microsatellites isolated from cdna using the described method could be useful for linkage mapping and comparative mapping and studies on genome evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a very simple and highly efficient method for identifying microsatellites from cdna. microsatellites isolated from cdna showed polymorphism and a mendelian pattern of inheritance. therefore, the method will be ideal for isolation of microsatellites from cdna of fish species where there are no est sequences available or the number of ests is limited.
