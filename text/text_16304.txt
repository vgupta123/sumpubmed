BACKGROUND
arcanobacterium haemolyticum, a gram positive, pleomorphic rod, causes wound infections and pharyngitis and can occasionally cause more severe invasive diseases such as endocarditis, meningitis, septic arthritis, pneumonia and osteomyelitis in humans  <cit> . there is strong epidemiologic evidence for a. haemolyticum being the only or primary isolate from throat specimens of some humans with pharyngitis  <cit>  and these data suggest that the number of cases per year of a. haemolyticum-mediated pharyngitis is ~ <dig> - <dig>  with  <dig> - <dig> million lost work days in the united states. the organism, previously in the corynebacterium genus, was classified as the first member of the genus arcanobacterium  <cit> . the other members of the genus are uncommonly isolated and remain largely uncharacterized, with the exception of trueperella  pyogenes, which is an important opportunistic livestock pathogen  <cit> .

little is known about a. haemolyticum virulence factors with the exception of a phospholipase d   <cit> , which causes dermonecrosis  <cit> . we recently described the ability of pld to reorganize host membrane lipid rafts, leading to enhanced bacterial adhesion  <cit> . furthermore, a. haemolyticum was able to invade hela cells and once intracellular, pld was able to kill host cells via direct necrosis  <cit> . these effects could potentially lead to bacterial dissemination to deeper tissues.

it is thought that clinical microbiology laboratories often miss a. haemolyticum in clinical specimens due to the organism's weak hemolytic activity on the commonly-used sheep blood agar, and therefore it may be misinterpreted as commensal diphtheroids and the isolate discarded. however, this organism displays more pronounced hemolysis on human and rabbit blood  <cit> . the organism has been known to have hemolytic activity since its initial discovery in  <dig>  <cit> , yet no bona fide hemolysin has been previously reported. pld itself is not directly hemolytic, but causes synergistic hemolysis with bacteria that express cholesterol oxidase  <cit> , prompting a search for the a. haemolyticum hemolysin. possible clues to the identity of the a. haemolyticum hemolysin come from studies on the hemolytic bacterium t. pyogenes, which is closely related to a. haemolyticum. t. pyogenes expresses plo, a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin  toxin family, as its primary virulence factor and this molecule is a hemolysin  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that the hemolytic activity expressed by a. haemolyticum was due to the presence of an uncharacterized cdc.

here we report the identification and characterization of a cdc from a. haemolyticum, designated arcanolysin . we show that aln has several distinct structural features among the cdc family and demonstrate that aln is cholesterol-dependent and provide evidence that aln has variable hemolytic and cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells from different species. we propose aln is the long, sought-after hemolysin.

nucleotide sequence determination and analysis
prior to the recent genbank deposit of the  <dig>  mb genome from strain atcc <dig>   <cit> , we sequenced the same strain to > 20× coverage , with ~ <dig>  mb of unique sequence  with essentially identical sequence data. a translated orf with amino acid similarity to cdcs, arch_ <dig>  was identified within this sequence. oligonucleotide primers flanking this orf were used to amplify the region by pcr. the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by automated dna sequencing of both strands. the aln sequence data and flanking regions were submitted to the genbank/embl/ddbj databases under accession number fj <dig>

cloning and purification of a recombinant, 6xhis tagged-aln 
the aln gene, without the signal sequence, was amplified from a. haemolyticum atcc <dig> genomic dna by pcr with his-alnf  and aln <dig>  encoding bamhi and xhoi sites , respectively. these primers amplified a  <dig>  bp product. the pcr fragment was digested with bamhi-xhoi and cloned into ptrchisb , to generate pbj <dig>  which encoded the  <dig>  kda his-aln. the final his-aln translational fusion protein thus has the mwvgsqkhyffyqdrgkimtrrflatvagtallagafapgvafg signal sequence removed and replaced with the sequence from the vector that leads to mggshhhhhhgmasmtggqqmgrdlyddddkdp . no other aln native amino acids were removed. cultures for purification of his-aln were grown and lysed as described  <cit> . his-aln was purified from the soluble cell fraction using talon metal affinity resin, as described . his-aln was eluted from the resin with  <dig> mm imidazole,  <dig> mm tris-hcl,  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig>  . total protein concentration was determined using bradford protein assay reagent .

hemolytic assays
the hemolytic titers of his-aln preparations were determined by incubation of two-fold serial dilutions of protein with an equal volume of  <dig> % blood  at 37°c for  <dig> h  <cit> . the hemolytic titer was the reciprocal of the highest dilution which resulted in 50% cell lysis, expressed as hemolytic units   <cit> . the specific activity of purified his-aln was determined as hu/μg protein. thiol activation was assessed by incubation of  <dig> hu his-aln with 2% β-mercaptoethanol for  <dig> min at room temperature, prior to performing a hemolytic assay with human blood . cholesterol inhibition was assessed by incubation of  <dig> hu his-aln with  <dig> - <dig> μm cholesterol for  <dig> min at room temperature with shaking, prior to performing a hemolytic assay with human blood. cholesterol was diluted in absolute ethanol and an equal volume of ethanol was used as the cholesterol-free control. his-tagged perfringolysin o   <cit>  and his-tagged plo  <cit>  were used as controls in the various hemolytic assays. for some experiments hemolysis assays were performed as described  <cit> .

epithelial cell cytotoxicity
the epithelial cell cytotoxicity of his-aln was determined using the celltiter 96® aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay . a <dig> , cho , hct- <dig> , j774a. <dig> , mdbk , mdck  and rk- <dig>  cells were cultured in iscove's modified dulbecco's medium or rmpi  <dig> with 10% fetal bovine serum and  <dig> μg/ml gentamicin in a humidified, 5% co <dig> atmosphere at 37°c. cells were seeded into 96-well plates at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well and incubated for  <dig> h to achieve 80% confluence. triplicate wells were incubated with doubling dilutions of his-aln  and incubated for  <dig> h, prior to addition of substrate for  <dig> h. determination of cell viability was performed using the appropriate control values .

membrane binding assay
the membrane binding assay was performed using erythrocytes as previously described  <cit> . his-aln was diluted to  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> in pbs,  <dig> μl was added to an equal volume of 50%  blood and the mixture was incubated on ice for  <dig> min. cells were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min at 4°c, resuspended in sds-page sample buffer and subjected to sds-page and western blotting with antiserum against his-aln.

RESULTS
cloning and nucleotide sequence determination of aln
a draft genome sequence of a. haemolyticum atcc  <dig> was determined and consists of  <dig> contigs that encompass ~ <dig>  mb in size .  <dig>  orfs were preliminarily identified using the rapid annotation using subsystem technology  server  <cit> . within this sequence, we identified orf arch_ <dig>  the translation of which displayed similarity to other cdcs. the  <dig>  bp gene was designated aln, for arcanolysin . upstream of aln are a phosphoglycerate mutase gene   and an alanine trnaggc . in the  <dig> bp intergenic region are regulatory signals predicted to be involved in aln transcription, including a putative σ <dig> promoter and  <dig> direct repeats t) which are similar to those found immediately upstream of plo, encoding plo, the cdc of t. pyogenes  <cit> .  <dig> bp downstream of aln is a transcriptional terminator with a Δg = - <dig>  kcal/mol. downstream of aln and divergently transcribed is arch_ <dig>  the arch_ <dig> protein displays amino acid similarity to hypothetical proteins from a number of genome sequences, including corynebacterium jeikeium , and features a signal sequence. further downstream is an additional alanine trnacgc, which is 91% identical at the nucleotide level to the alanine trnaggc upstream of aln. further downstream of the 2nd alanine trna is arch_ <dig>  a gene that is predicted to encode a conserved hypothetical protein related to corynebacterium diphtheriae , and a gene, arch_ <dig> , with similarity to type ii or sam-dependent methyltransferases .

the %g+c for aln is  <dig> %  compared with  <dig> - <dig> % for the surrounding genes and  <dig> % for the entire genome. given the lower %g+c of the aln gene and the presence of flanking trna genes, which can act as sites of foreign gene insertion  <cit> , it is possible that the a. haemolyticum aln gene was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

aln is widely distributed in a. haemolyticum isolates
the prevalence of the aln gene was determined by dna hybridization. a dig-labeled probe spanning bases 492- <dig>  of the aln orf was hybridized to genomic dna from a. haemolyticum atcc <dig>   <dig> a. haemolyticum clinical isolates  and t. pyogenes bbr <dig>  as a negative control. the aln probe hybridized at high stringency to all a. haemolyticum isolates , but not t. pyogenes genomic dna , indicating that this gene appears to be highly prevalent in a. haemolyticum. the region of aln from which the probe was derived has  <dig> % identity to the corresponding nucleotide region in plo of t. pyogenes. under high stringency hybridization conditions, dna sequences which are less than 70% identical do not hybridize.

analysis of the primary structure of aln
the predicted aln protein is  <dig> amino acids in length, including a  <dig> amino acid signal sequence predicted by signalp. the mature protein lacking the signal sequence has a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. aln is most similar to plo with  <dig> % and  <dig> % amino acid identity and similarity  and has ~50% similarity to other cdc family members. within the aln n-terminus, the pestfind algorithm identified a putative pest sequence not present in plo or most other cdc sequences . listeriolysin o , which contains a bona fide pest sequence  <cit> , returned a pestfind score of  <dig> , while aln had a score of  <dig> , indicating a higher probability of containing a functional pest sequence. given that a. haemolyticum invades host cells  <cit> , it is possible that the pest sequence allows for a similar compartmentalization of aln activity within the host cell. like plo, the predicted amino acid sequence of aln has a variant undecapeptide in domain  <dig> and both lack the conserved cysteine residue . the tryptophan spacing of aln and plo  also differs from the consensus sequence  .

cloning and expression of his-aln
sds-page and coomassie brilliant blue staining of iptg-induced cultures of pbj51-containing e. coli indicated the presence of an over-expressed protein of ~ <dig> kda . his-aln was purified to > 95% homogeneity using talon resin , and the size of this protein  corresponded to its predicted molecular mass. antiserum against aln, but not pre-immune antiserum, reacted specifically with his-aln and some possible his-aln degradation products .

recombinant aln has cytotoxic activity
a. haemolyticum is not strongly hemolytic when grown on ovine  blood agar  <cit> . likewise, the e. coli strain expressing his-aln did not display hemolysis when grown on bovine blood agar . similarly, his-aln displays low hemolysis with bovine or ovine erythrocytes . in contrast, his-aln had ~4- and 10-fold increased hemolytic activity on rabbit and human erythrocytes, respectively . this is in contrast to pfo or plo, which show little difference in specific activity on erythrocytes from different hosts. consistent with these findings, hemolysis assays demonstrated that aln has a preference for horse or human cells over porcine cells but lyses all of these at high toxin concentrations . this is in contrast to intermedilysin  from streptococcus intermedius, which retains human-specific tropism over a wide concentration range, and plo, which is less selective than aln .

the highly-conserved cys residue in the undecapeptide of cdcs is responsible for thiol activation of this group of toxins  <cit> . aln lacks the cys residue in the undecapeptide , and like plo  <cit> , its activity was unaffected by treatment with β-mercaptoethanol .

we also determined the effect of recombinant aln on cultured mammalian cells. his-aln was applied to human, bovine, canine, hamster, mouse and rabbit cell lines and was highly active on human and rabbit cells , with low activity on bovine, mouse and canine cells. this toxin had intermediate activity on hamster cells . this finding mirrors the activity of aln on blood from different host species , and is less species-specific than intermedilysin  or vaginolysin   <cit> . ily, vly, and lectinolysin  use human cd <dig>  as a membrane receptor  <cit> , leading to host-specificity. unlike these other cdc toxins aln hemolysis was not blocked with a monoclonal antibody against hcd <dig> . consistent with this finding, the predicted aln amino acid sequence lacks the tyr-x-tyr-x14-ser-arg signature motif common to all known hcd59-dependent cdcs  <cit> .

the activity of aln is less sensitive to cholesterol inhibition than pfo
given the more restrictive host species preference of aln over that of pfo, along with the variant undecapeptide sequence in aln, we hypothesized that aln might be less sensitive to inhibition by free cholesterol. as expected, pfo activity was almost completely inhibited by exogenous  <dig>  μm cholesterol . in contrast, plo and aln retained  <dig> % and  <dig> % activity, respectively, when incubated with  <dig>  μm cholesterol and retained ~20% of hemolytic activity at  <dig> μm cholesterol . these data indicate that aln and plo have intermediate sensitivity to cholesterol compared to a cdc  with the conserved undecapeptide sequence.

aln binds differentially to host cell membranes
hemolytic assays measure the full spectrum of cdc binding, oligomerization and pore formation leading to cell lysis. however, initial toxin binding to membranes can be determined by incubation of cdcs with host cells at 4°c, which prevents subsequent oligomerization and pore formation  <cit> . using this approach, his-aln bound to human and rabbit erythrocytes as determined by western blotting . probable aln degradation products were also detected. his-aln did not exhibit detectable binding to bovine or ovine erythrocyte membranes under these conditions. as a control, his-pfo was incubated with human, bovine, ovine or rabbit erythrocytes, and bound toxin was detected with anti-pfo antiserum. his-pfo bound to all cell types at approximately equivalent amounts . these data suggest that aln host preference may occur at the initial contact of the toxin with the host cell membrane.

discussion
the cdcs are a family of bacterial toxins produced by diverse gram-positive bacteria and are generally important in pathogenesis  <cit> . cdcs have a four-domain structure and a conserved c-terminal undecapeptide sequence in domain  <dig> that is important for toxin function. soluble cdc monomers bind to host membrane targets, oligomerize into a large homomeric structure known as the prepore complex, and transition to a true pore, leading to cytolysis of target cells  <cit> . cdcs interact with membrane cholesterol through a conserved threonine-leucine pair in domain  <dig>  and this interaction is crucial to the formation of functional pores  <cit> . some cdcs, including ily, vly, and lly, require the presence of hcd <dig> as a membrane receptor, conferring human-specific activity  <cit> . among the cdcs, plo is unusual, as it contains a variant of the highly conserved domain  <dig> undecapeptide, and this divergent sequence is essential for full plo activity  <cit> . the aln undecapeptide is most similar to that of plo , in that it retains the three tryptophan residues of the consensus undecapeptide but employs an alternate spacing . the tryptophan residues of the undecapeptide are known to be important for insertion of domain  <dig> into host cell membranes  <cit> . like the human-specific cdcs , aln contains a proline in its undecapeptide sequence. however, the hemolytic activity of aln was not blocked by antibodies to human cd <dig>  which acts as a receptor for the human-specific cdcs  <cit> , suggesting that aln may interact with a distinct membrane receptor, perhaps in addition to cholesterol. the nature of the aln receptor is currently unknown and is under investigation. although the cysteine residue in the consensus undecapeptide confers the property of thiol activation to cdcs, the cysteine is not essential for streptolysin o and pneumolysin toxin function  <cit> . the human-specific cdcs , plo, and aln all lack this conserved cysteine residue, but the contribution of this sequence variation to toxin function is not yet known for these toxins.

some cdcs have a number of functions beyond simple pore formation. streptococcus pyogenes uses streptolysin o to introduce a bacterial effector into host cells via a novel mechanism termed cytolysin-mediated translocation   <cit> . at sublytic concentrations, cdcs may act as ligands for toll-like receptors  <cit>  and may induce a cycle of p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  phosphorylation and dephosphorylation  <cit> . llo allows listeria monocytogenes to escape from the vacuole into the cytoplasm where the organism can rapidly multiply  <cit> . the site-specific nature of llo is controlled by cytosolic down-regulation of llo function due to an n-terminal pest-like sequence, which usually targets eukaryotic proteins for cytosolic degradation. the pest sequence results in a substantially reduced half-life of llo in the cytoplasm of the host cell  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
aln has several unique features among the cdc family. aln has a variant undecapeptide and possesses an unusual n-terminal extension, with a putative pest sequence. moreover, aln lacks the conserved cysteine of thiol-activated cdcs, explaining why β-mercaptothanol had no effect on aln function. the unique sequences and predicted structural features of aln will make it an interesting toxin to conduct future structure-function analyses to identify additional unique properties of this toxin. aln displays an unusual pattern of target cell species selectivity, with high activity against human, horse, and rabbit cells and lesser activity against cells derived from other species. this selectivity appears to function at the level of membrane binding and may contribute to the host range of a. haemolyticum. further work will focus on understanding the role of aln in a. haemolyticum pathogenesis.
