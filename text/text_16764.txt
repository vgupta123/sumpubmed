BACKGROUND
lymphopenia results in high mortality and morbidity among cancer patients receiving a hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation, or suffering from hiv infection  <cit> . eradication of hematological cancers is very successful using haplo-identical hsc transplantation  <cit> , but many patients succumb to opportunistic infections that are the direct consequence of the lymphopenia, mainly involving the t cell pool  <cit> ; it often takes more than  <dig> days before  t cell levels have normalized again. this underlines the need for, and explains the general interest in, methods capable of enhancing t cell reconstitution  <cit> .

two important problems associated with slow recovery of t cell levels involve the thymus: slow thymic reconstitution by blood-borne progenitors and thymic involution  <cit> . because it is still not possible to control and/or reverse either of these processes, there is an obvious need to establish methods that generate a de novo t cell repertoire in vitro. however, the development of such systems is hampered because most processes that occur in the thymus are still enigmatic, especially how the thymus is capable to enforce self versus non-self recognition on developing thymocytes  <cit> . understanding the process of positive/negative selection, and reproducing the process in vitro, would potentially help to reduce lymphopenia, especially in older patients as the thymus involutes with age. in this context, the results on thymus-independent t cell development previously described by clark et al. are remarkable. this method involves a seemingly simple co-culture system consisting of skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts grown on a three-dimensional  tantalum covered scaffold  that, after  <dig> weeks co-culture with allogenic hsc, results in a population containing 3-5% t cells tolerant to the skin-donor  <cit> . even though t cells were detected, only a limited fraction of the expanded hsc actually became t-lineage committed; many cells differentiated towards class ii+ apc, a convenient aspect since it was suggested to be important for cd4+ t cell development  <cit> . additional explanations for the extra-thymic development of t cells were the co-incidental expression of various components known to be important for hsc differentiation and thymus-function, such as delta-like ligand   <cit>  and autoimmune regulator   <cit>  by keratinocytes and fibroblasts  <cit> , respectively.

even though direct mechanistic explanations for the extra-thymic development of t cells are lacking, and despite limited numbers, it still remains the only published method potentially capable of generating functional, clinical-grade, mature t cells ex vivo. because of the clinical importance, we made an effort to establish the skin-cell system in our laboratory and to characterize it in more detail. we observed that keratinocytes do express the notch ligand jagged <dig>  but we did not find the abundant expression of dll protein previously reported by clark et al. on keratinocytes. furthermore, due to the growth characteristics of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the statamatrix®, we could not reproduce the co-cultures as described by clark et al.  <cit> . as a result, we never observed any t-lineage differentiation. the various reasons for the unsuccessful reproduction of this method are described in this report.

RESULTS
the in vitro t cell development from donor cd34+ cells as described by clark et al.  <cit>  requires a co-culture of  keratinocytes and fibroblasts. to confirm expression of determinants reported to be important for in vitro differentiation, and establish co-cultures, we prepared keratinocyte and fibroblast cell banks from various donors and different skin sources. sufficient numbers of early passage stocks were available from  <dig> donors for all experiments.

is dll expressed by keratinocytes?
many papers have described the necessity for notch signaling in t cell determination and differentiation from cd34+ cells . one of the most obvious and logical explanations provided by clark et al.  <cit>  for the generation of t cells was the innate potential of matured keratinocytes to express dll protein. to detect/confirm dll expression on intact keratinocytes, we used three different methods.

facs analysis
in the paper by clark et al.  <cit> , it was not specified at what stage the keratinocytes were harvested, and which dll was detected by the polyclonal h <dig> antibody. in our hands, the differentiation procedure resulted in a mixture of undifferentiated and early-differentiated cells; none of the "differentiated" keratinocytes ever lost ck <dig> expression, which is a marker for mature keratinocytes . by using murine cell-lines  over-expressing human dll <dig> or  <dig> it became clear that the h <dig> antibody used for facs and if does recognize dll <dig>  but not dll <dig> . using a murine stromal cell line transduced with human dll <dig> as positive control, which shows intense staining of dll <dig> on immunoblot , we found that it was possible to detect dll <dig> on vital cells by flowcytometry , albeit with difficulty . when matured keratinocytes were indirectly stained with h <dig> for analysis by facs, we were never able to detect a specific signal from h <dig> on vital, 7aad- keratinocytes . other primary rabbit antibodies specific for intracellular antigens, normally not expressed by keratinocytes like nos <dig> and irf <dig>  also stained 7aad- keratinocytes , indicating that these antibody-preparations may not be suitable for analysis by facs. we did find that 7aad+/dapi+ cells were intensely stained by all primary rabbit antibodies, including h <dig> , generating a false positive h265/ssc picture very similar as published by clark et al.  <cit> . apparently, it is possible to use the facs procedure in combination with h <dig> to detect dll <dig> expression on the surface of dll1-transfected cell-lines, but it cannot be used to reliably stain dll on vital keratinocytes.

another question that arose was whether h <dig> is suitable for detection of intact dll. because the antibody was generated against a peptide spanning the membrane and the first twenty amino-acids of the extracellular domain, it may recognize processed dll only , thereby under-representing the actual level of dll surface-expression. therefore, using a goat-polyclonal antibody capable of binding to a known, accessible epitope in the extracellular domain of dll <dig>  h <dig>  we repeated the experiments with dll-transduced cells  and keratinocytes , but no specific staining on intact keratinocytes was detected. when considering the weak specific signals obtained with either h <dig> or h <dig> on cell-lines over-expressing dll, it is obvious to conclude that it is impossible to demonstrate spontaneous dll expression on intact primary cells with these antibodies.

immunofluorescence
to confirm dll expression by facs, clark et al.  <cit>  used immunofluorescence on fixed keratinocytes prepared by cytospin, which is an application reported suitable for both h <dig> and h <dig>  however, again no detection of any dll staining of intact, differentiated keratinocytes was observed; the occasional green cell we did see  proved to have no nucleus . in contrast, keratinocytes did stain positive for notch ligand jagged- <dig> .

pcr
since it was not possible to reliably detect dll <dig> or dll <dig> protein, we reverted to pcr to find out whether matured keratinocytes are at least capable to express high level of dll rna. as shown in figure 4b, compared with gene-products normally expressed by keratinocytes, cdna encoding for dll <dig> required  <dig> cycles before detection. clearly, expression of dll is far from abundant in differentiated or immature keratinocytes . in contrast to dll expression, the high level of jagged- <dig> expression was confirmed by detecting pcr products after  <dig> cycles . this observation is in line with a previous report demonstrating high levels of jagged- <dig> expression at various stages of keratinocyte-development  <cit> .

in summary, using three different methods we could not detect any dll expression by keratinocytes, which makes it unlikely that hsc differentiation towards t lineage as observed by clark et al.  <cit>  is initiated by t-lineage commitment induced by dll expressed on keratinocytes. of course, we do not know whether  keratinocytes start to express dll during co-culture with fibroblasts, or whether dll-expression by keratinocytes is actually required for the extra-thymic t cell development. on the other hand, keratinocytes do show abundant expression of jagged- <dig>  even though jagged- <dig> by itself is not particularly efficient in induction of t-lineage differentiation of cord blood derived cd34+ cells  <cit> , and its expression in the murine thymus is not abundant  <cit> , jagged-1-mediated activation of murine thymic precursors does result in t/nk progenitors  <cit> . therefore, it cannot be excluded that jagged- <dig> does so as well in the context of the skin explants system.

a balanced co-culture?
the system requires co-culture of keratinocytes and fibroblasts on the statamatrix®. however, "matured" keratinocytes showed limited capacity to adhere to collagen-coated statamatrices®, in contrast to fibroblasts, and these latter cells always overgrew in keratinocyte-fibroblast co-cultures in matrices within  <dig> days .

skin explant procedure did not result in t lineage-development
we found that hsc  were never able to differentiate towards t-lineage cells in matrices containing isolated and cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes; most hsc did up-regulate cd <dig> and lost the cd <dig> marker, but no expression of early t-lineage markers like cd <dig> , nor the cd <dig> nk cell marker were observed . in contrast, the same batches of hsc demonstrated excellent t lineage differentiation capacity when grown on murine stromal cell lines expressing human dll  <cit> .

dll-independent development?
as indicated, the phenotype of the differentiated hsc suggested lack of notch signaling, which could be due to the lowered keratinocyte/fibroblast ratio. since it seems very difficult to alter that ratio with the published protocol, it may be difficult to routinely use the skin explants procedure. however, the explants system remains unique in the fact that it encompasses complete t cell development resulting in functional, single-positive cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells, which includes the poorly understood process of positive/negative selection. because canonical t-cell development roughly consists of  <dig> phases - 1) dll-dependent t-lineage commitment, 2) dll-independent beta-chain selection, and 3) dll-dependent positive/negative selection, we investigated whether t cell development could occur with cells that already have received dll-signaling and are t/nk or completely t-lineage committed  <cit> . unfortunately, when t/nk-lineage committed cells were seeded in skin-explants, most became nk-lineage committed cd56+ cells , in the presence of additional il- <dig>  thymocyte-like cells were never detected. when il- <dig> was omitted, the viability and yield of the cultures were reduced considerably, and most cells lost cd <dig> and icd <dig> expression , indicating that even in the presence of il- <dig> and flt3-l, the keratinocyte/fibroblast co-cultures were not able to maintain the t-lineage committed status of cells. the few cells remaining also displayed a cd56+ phenotype.

discussion
our results clearly demonstrate that the keratinocyte differentiation procedure results either in fragile cells that fail to adhere to any structure or plate, or cells that do adhere but are outcompeted by fibroblasts within a week. furthermore, differentiated keratinocytes do not express detectable levels of dll , and therefore the t-lineage commitment observed by clark et al.  <cit>  must be mediated by other factors. jagged- <dig> may be responsible for steering development towards the t-lineage of a limited fraction of cd34+ cells in their co-culture system, because it is abundantly expressed by keratinocytes. as stated in the results section, certain t lineage committed stadia can complete their development into dp and sp t cells independent of notch signaling  <cit> .

however, even if t cells can be generated ex vivo using the skin explants system, the question remains whether they will be functional. extra-thymic development of t cells has been described for oncostatin m  transgenic mice, where lns take over the function of the thymus  <cit> . even though in oncm mice the t cells appear to go through the same developmental stages as regular thymocytes, they are less functional, which may be the result of positive selection by other hematopoietic cells instead of thymic epithelium  <cit> . this, however, remains to be elucidated for t cells derived in any in vitro cell differentiation system.

the past decade knowledge-driven research has revealed how t-lineage commitment can be induced in hsc in vitro, using cell-lines transfected with hudll  <cit> , or, to a certain extent, with recombinant hudll  <cit> . in contrast to mouse, differentiation of human progenitors rarely get past the dp-stage of thymocyte development, indicating it is difficult to push them through the positive-negative selection process. interestingly, experiments with human t-progenitors sorted as or arrested at a dn2-3-like stage, obtained from either op9-dll or tst-4-dll - hsc co-cultures, respectively, demonstrated that these cells were capable of rapidly reconstituting the thymus of rag2-/-γc-/- mice, where they completed their maturation  <cit> . similar experiments with murine t-progenitors have shown that this approach considerably enhanced the generation of functional t cells after hsc transplantation  <cit> . this approach will certainly be applicable to patients in the near future, but still relies on the functional capacity of the thymus, which is limited in older patients. in this regard, more pragmatic research has resulted in several viable approaches capable of improving thymic function  <cit> , which are now being tested in clinical trials  <cit> . the solutions to both problems concerning t cell reconstitution are expected to meet within the next decade.

CONCLUSIONS
the results described by clark et al.  <cit>  are fascinating and unique, but remain elusive. the results in the current paper show that by following the published procedure we could not obtain enough evidence to support the basic skin cell co-culture conditions suggested to be required for hsc differentiation towards mature t cells. recent advancements in the field of t cell lineage differentiation and thymic rejuvenation will generate alternative procedures to reconstitute the t cell population following hsc transplantation of man.
