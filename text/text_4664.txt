BACKGROUND
acetobacter is a genus of acetic acid bacteria characterized by the ability to convert ethanol to acetic acid in the presence of oxygen. acetobacter sp. is widely used in various fields of biotechnology  <cit> . the longest-established applications of this genus are the strains used for producing vinegar by oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid  <cit> . in addition, bacterial cellulose produced by acetobacter xylinum has attracted attention because of its unique physical and mechanical properties such as its existence as pure cellulose aggregate, high crystallinity, high biocompatibility, and hence its promising properties for application in composite membranes  <cit> , medical materials  <cit> , electronic paper  <cit>  and fuel cells  <cit> . strains of acetobacter have also proven to be efficient biocatalysts for the enantioselective oxidation of various alcohols to yield optically pure carboxylic acids. for example, molinari et al. studied the oxidation of 2-phenylpropanol with acetobacter aceti  <cit> , prochiral 2-methyl- <dig>  3-propandiol by acetobacter pasteurianus  <cit> , and polyconjugated compounds catalyzed by acetobacter aceti  <cit> . however, there have been only a few studies of the application of acetobacter for asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones. a novel strain, acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  reported in our previous paper  <cit> , isolated from chinese kefir grains, showed exclusive anti-prelog stereoselectivity for the reduction of 4--3-butyn-2-one to -4--3-butyn-2-ol, which is a key chiral intermediate for the synthesis of -benzyl-4-hydroxyl-2-pentynoate, a molecule that has potential therapeutic function for alzheimer's disease. also, acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> effectively catalyzed asymmetric reduction of a series of prochiral aryl ketones and hence may be suitable for synthesis of valuable chiral alcohols. whilst the substrate range and enantioselectivity of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> are promising and have enabled a biotransformation that has not been effectively accomplished with other strains, the low biomass density produced by cultures of this strain is a limitation for its application and commercialization. for example, the twelve strains of acetic acid bacteria investigated previously by romano et al. for use in enantioselective biocatalysis gave average culture biomass densities between  <dig>  to  <dig>  g/l  <cit> . in contrast, acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> yielded much less biomass in basic medium  and tomato juice medium . previous reports in the literature have shown that culture conditions can greatly influence alcohol dehydrogenase  activities from acetic acid bacteria such as acetobacter sp.  <cit>  and gluconobacter oxydans  <cit> . thus, the current study was undertaken with the aim of more thoroughly exploring the growth medium composition and culture conditions to improve growth and reduction activity of the novel strain acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> toward practical applications.

whilst the classical 'one-factor-at-a-time' method has the severe limitation that it does not allow investigation of interactions between variables, it can be useful under certain circumstances, such as when the primary goal is to attain improvements in performance  and where experimental error is small compared to the effect of the factors under study  <cit> . among multivariate optimization methods that can be used more reliably to find global maxima, the response surface methodology  has previously been shown to be powerful and practicable for program optimization and is often used to identify the relative significance of different factors, interactions between factors and optimal level of test variables. for example, the rsm method was successfully applied to enhance mycelial biomass and polysaccharides produced by hericium erinaceum  <cit> , biosurfactant produced by bacillus mycoides  <cit> , protease produced by bacillus clause  <cit>  and avermectin b1a produced by streptomyces avermitilis 14-12a  <cit> .

in the present work, the important influential factors affecting the growth and activity of the new strain were initially unknown and so there were a potentially very large number of permutations to study if a multivariate optimization method such as rsm were used from the outset. we therefore began by using a systematic one-factor-at-a-time optimization method to investigate the effects of medium components and culture conditions on the growth and reduction activity of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  the response surface methodology was then employed, in order to further improve the biomass and the specific activity of the novel strain by more rigorous exploration of the conditions that were indicated as important by the one-factor-at-a-time results. the biocatalytic asymmetric reduction of 4'-chloroacetophenone to -1- ethanol was employed as a model reaction for evaluating the effects of the various culture condition on the activity of the strain. in addition, the enantioselective reduction of 4--3-butyn-2-one to -4--3-butyn-2-ol catalyzed by cells in improved media was investigated.

RESULTS
effect of the carbon source
during the growth of microorganisms, the carbon source in the culture medium plays an important role for the growth of cells, the production of metabolites and the availability of energy to drive endergonic reactions. according to previous studies, the source of carbon for acetobacter is species and strain dependent. to establish the effect of carbon sources on the growth and reduction activity of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  the carbohydrates glucose, fructose, galactose, arabinose, ribose, xylose, lactose and sucrose were tested individually as carbon sources  in place of the glucose in the basic medium; the control medium was the basic medium with the omission of glucose. the results  showed that fructose-containing medium gave most abundant cell growth, but lowest reduction activity. in contrast, the glucose-containing medium gave highest specific reduction activity, but relatively poor cell growth. these contrasting effects of carbon source on biomass yield and enzyme activity were consistent with previous studies on acetobacter strains. in acetobacter methanolicus and acetobacter aceti it was found previously that carbon sources which were advantageous to growth did not give best activities of alcohol dehydrogenase , owing in part to the formation of an inactive form of adh during growth in certain media  <cit> . moreover, addition of glucose influenced the activities of individual components of the electron-transport systems of the aerobic bacteria azotobacter vinelandii and acetobacter suboxydans  <cit> , which suggested that carbon source may influence the availability of electron donors for biocatalytic reduction reactions. since fructose gave best biomass yield and glucose gave best specific reduction activity, media containing mixtures of fructose and glucose were investigated . it was found that the medium containing  <dig>  g/l glucose and  <dig>  g/l fructose gave the best combination of cell growth  and reduction activity .

effect of nitrogen source
various organic and inorganic nitrogen sources  were also examined for their effects on growth and reduction activity in place of the peptone and yeast extract in the basic medium . cells grown in the medium containing soy peptone as nitrogen source produced the largest amount of biomass. indeed, soy peptone is a complex ingredient which contains several essential amino acids as well as many other growth-promoting factors and it is known that its addition can have a positive influence on biomass production  <cit> . lower biomasses were observed in culture media containing other complex nitrogen sources  and the acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> grew very little in media with ammonium sulfate or urea as the nitrogen source, or in the control medium without the addition of a nitrogen source.

of all the nitrogen sources tested, the highest reduction activity was obtained with yeast extract. high reduction activities were also obtained in media with soy peptone and a mixture of peptone and yeast extract. the other organic and inorganic nitrogen sources gave substantially lower reduction activities and were judged unsuitable for producing highly active biocatalyst. mixtures of soy peptone and yeast extract  were also tested as nitrogen source, but the result was no better than soy peptone alone , therefore, soy peptone  was chosen as the nitrogen source for subsequent experiments. the effects of different concentrations of soy peptone  were also investigated. biomass and specific activity were improved with the increase of concentration, but higher than  <dig> g/l gave negligible improvement and so a concentration of soy peptone of  <dig> g/l was selected for further study which gave a high cell growth  and reduction activity .

effect of mineral element
seven mineral elements  were chosen for investigation as medium additives based on their known roles in bacterial metabolism and as cofactors for metabolic enzymes  <cit> . addition of the various mineral elements to the culture medium was investigated by adding the salts k2hpo <dig>  mgso4·7h2o, cacl <dig>  mnso4·h2o, znso4·7h2o, feso <dig> and cuso4·5h2o to separate aliquots of media to concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l, respectively, in place of the k2hpo <dig> in the basic medium. these concentrations were selected based on the requirement for these elements for the growth of microorganisms in previous studies, and to keep their concentrations below expected inhibitory levels  <cit> . most of the minerals did not have a substantial effect on yields of biomass or reduction activity ; however, mn2+ improved the growth and reduction activity by extending the logarithmic growth phase. it has been reported previously that manganese is an important component of tomato juice when used for the cultivation of microorganisms  <cit> , which was consistent with our result and suggested that supplementation with manganese may be an alternative to addition of tomato juice to the medium for cultivation of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  the addition of k, mg, ca and zn ions has been found to improve cell growth and product yields in other studies  <cit>  but afforded negligible benefits here, presumably because none of these minerals was limiting for cell growth or reduction activity. fe and cu ions slightly inhibited reduction activity, which may be due to their relatively high concentrations for this strain. to determine the effect of mn2+ concentration on the biomass and reduction activity of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  different concentrations of mnso4·h2o ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  g/l were added to the medium. a manganese concentration of  <dig>  g/l gave a maximum biomass yield of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l and a maximum specific reduction activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min/g.

effects of extra vitamins
vitamins play a key role for many microorganisms because they act as coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes  <cit> ; they are therefore often crucial for cell growth and enzyme activities at very small concentrations. indeed, complex nutrient sources such as soy peptone contain certain vitamins at small concentrations, so it is possible that part of the beneficial effect of adding such preparations to the medium was because they were supplying vitamin. to investigate the effect of vitamins specifically, the following vitamins were added to the medium: thiamine , nicotinic acid , pyridoxine  and ascorbic acid , biotin , each at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/l. however, none of the vitamins examined produced notable differences from the control without added vitamins . the reason may be that such vitamins that the culture required were already present in the soy peptone component of the medium.

effects of the initial ph
the ph value of culture medium can affect the functions of the cell membrane, the cell structure, the uptake of various nutritional sources, and the biosynthesis of metabolites  <cit> . the effects of the initial ph of the culture medium on growth and reduction activity of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> were studied. the initial ph  <dig> gave the best combination of cell growth  and reduction activity . cell growth and reduction activity were inhibited as the ph increased above  <dig> and no growth was observed when the initial ph was ≥  <dig> or ≤ <dig> . it can be seen that the growth and reduction activity changed very little between ph  <dig> and  <dig>  which confirmed a well-established observation that acetobacter sp. grow best under acidic conditions  <cit> .

effects of temperature and shaking rate
the effects of different culture temperatures and shaking rate were also investigated; the optimum growth and reduction activity were gained at 30°c and  <dig> rpm . the biomass yield and specific reduction activity were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min/g respectively at the conditions optimized by the one-at-a-time method.

optimization by response surface methodology
as detailed above, rsm is a useful and practicable method among different multivariate optimization methods. based on the results obtained from the one-factor-at-a-time experiments for optimizing the culture medium, the four variables that exhibited greatest effects on cell growth and reduction activity were chosen for ccrd. these were: carbon source, nitrogen source, mineral element and the initial ph. glucose , soy peptone and mn2+ were selected as the medium components  for further optimization based on the fact that these gave the best reduction activities and biomass yields during the one-at-a-time optimization. in the ccrd experiment the interactions of these medium components were investigated, together with the medium ph.

where y <dig> is the biomass , y <dig> is the reduction activity , and x <dig>  x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> are coded values of the independent variables . the other culture conditions were as fixed as follows, based on the results from the one-at-a-time optimization: temperature 30°c, shaking rate  <dig> rpm, inoculum 10% , cultivation time  <dig> h.

the analysis of variance  for the ccrd experiments was performed . the f-values and p-values were used to identify the effect of each factor on biomass and reduction activity. the models exhibited remarkable correlation with the experimental data with very high f-values  and very low p <  <dig>  for each model, which implied the significance of the two models . by inspection of the f- and p-values of each factor, it can be seen that glucose had the largest effect on biomass, followed by ph, mnso4·h2o and soy peptone. the order of effects on reduction activity was ph > glucose > soy peptone. within the examined concentration range , change of mnso4·h2o concentration showed only slight impact on the reduction activity. it is noteworthy that the variable that had greatest influence on the production of biomass  was different from that which exerted most significant impact on the reduction activity . it is well known that the metabolic networks of microorganisms are very complicated and respond in a complex manner to environmental conditions. here, the balance of these factors clearly resulted in a different response of reduction activity and cellular growth to the various culture conditions explored. it is possible that glucose concentration had greatest effect upon accumulation of biomass because cellular growth was limited to a large extent by the availability of glucose as the principal carbon and energy source of the cells. whilst there were many possible explanations of the large influence of medium ph on the reduction activity towards ketone substrates, including direct effects on enzyme activity and indirect ones mediated via changes in gene expression and the availability of electron donors. it is reasonable that the conditions that best favor growth are different from those that give highest reduction activity because the two processes may compete for the pool of available electron donors within the cell.

the closer the value of r <dig> is to  <dig>  the better is the adequacy of the model. in this case, the r <dig> values  indicated that actual values were very close to predicted values and showed that the models were reliable for predicting biomass and reduction activity, respectively, of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  the "lack of fit f-value" which were  <dig>   and  <dig>   also implied that the predicted values exhibit a good correlation with the experimental data. hence, all of the parameters indicated that the model was adequate for prediction.

three-dimensional response surface plots and corresponding contour plots were constructed to show the effects of the conditions on growth  and reduction activity  of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  the effects of independent variables are shown in pairs within the experimental range, while the other two variables in each case are fixed at center point levels. this kind of graphical visualization allows the relationships between the experimental levels of each factor and the response to be investigated, and the type of interactions between test variables to be determined, which is necessary to establish the optimal medium components and culture conditions. the elliptical nature of the curves indicates significant mutual interactions between variables, in contrast to the circular shapes of the contour plots. there was a large interactive effect of glucose and soy peptone on growth of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> . at low to moderate glucose concentration, the biomass increased marginally with the increase of soy peptone concentration, but at high glucose concentration, increase in soy peptone concentration led to much greater increase of biomass. substantial interaction was also observed between the effects on cell growth of the other pairs of variables shown, namely mnso4·h2o and ph  and glucose and mnso <dig> ·h2o .

when specific activity was considered, the strongest interaction between variables was that between mnso4·h2o and ph , followed by the interaction between glucose and soy peptone  and that between soy peptone and ph .

the optimum levels of the factors investigated can be deduced from the 3d and 2d response surface plots and the equations obtained from multiple regression analysis. the model predicted that the maximum cell growth  was located at x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, and x <dig> =  <dig> . likewise, the predicted specific activity  reached its maximum at the values: x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, and x <dig> =  <dig> . the predicted levels of factors to maximize biomass were rather different from those predicted to maximize the specific reduction activity. although specific activity requires moderate concentration of glucose and relative high ph, maximal biomass was achieved in the presence of a relative high concentration of glucose and low ph. for instance, in the nutrient medium needed for maximal specific activity , the predicted biomass was  <dig>  g/l, which was not satisfactory for practical applications. thus, numerical optimization of the overall desirability function was performed to determine the best possible goals for each response simultaneously. the predicted optimal values for the variables were as follows: x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, x <dig> =  <dig>  g/l, and x <dig> =  <dig> , and the predicted responses were: biomass,  <dig>  g/l; specific activity  <dig>  μmol/min/g.

to examine the validity of this model, nine successive experiments were performed in the predicted optimal medium. the average biomass  and specific activity  were very close to the predicted values and strongly support the suitability of the ccrd model developed in this study for improving the reaction.

comparison of cell growth and reduction activity of the strain in the improved and original basic media
the improved  medium described in the previous section was compared for growth and reduction activity of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> to the original basic medium used at the start of the study . cells cultured in the improved medium had longer logarithmic phase and reached the maximum of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l dcw at  <dig> h. the biomass yield was  <dig>  times higher than that from the basic medium. reduction activity reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min/g in the improved medium, which was  <dig> -fold higher than that in basic medium . hence, the optimization described in this study increased the reduction activity per litre of culture by more than 12-fold. the reduction activity declined sharply after reaching its maximum value in basic medium, however, in the improved medium cells maintained near-maximum activity between  <dig> and  <dig> h after inoculation. the reason for the improved stability of the activity may be that the presence of added manganese allows the reduction activity to be maintained for longer. the carbon source conversion in the improved medium was higher than in the basic medium , which was consistent with the biomass yield results and suggested that a greater amount of carbon source was available for growth and reduction activity by acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> in the improved medium. as shown in figure 4d, the ph decreased during cultivation in both media, but fell significantly more in the improved medium.

performance of the optimized biocatalyst for enantioselective reduction of 4--3-butyn-2-one
whilst the increase in biocatalyst biomass due to the optimization of the culture medium would benefit any reduction reaction catalyzed by acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  it was possible that the change in culture conditions might affect the rate of reduction of different substrates to different extents. the cells cultured in the improved medium were therefore tested as the biocatalyst for the key enantioselective reduction of 4--3-butyn-2-one to  - 4--3-butyn-2-ol that we investigated previously  <cit> . compared with the previous work, using cells prepared from the optimized reaction medium, under the reduction reaction conditions described previously, the initial reaction rate increased from  <dig>  μmol/min to  <dig>  μmol/min; the yield was enhanced from 71% to 83% and the product e.e. was > 99% after a reaction time of  <dig> min. hence the combined effects of increased biocatalyst biomass and increased yield would afford an extensive increase in the productivity of this reaction, which was comparable to the improvement achieved with the model reduction reaction used for the optimization. these results also represented an enantiocomplementary transformation to the reduction of 4--3-butyn-2-one to  - 4--3-butyn-2-ol catalysed by immobilized candida parapsilosis cctcc m <dig> cells in an ionic liquid system  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
cultivation conditions were optimized for acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig>  which acted as an anti-prelog specific whole cell biocatalysts for reduction of prochiral ketones. using a classical one-factor-at-one-time method followed by a response surface methodology, culture conditions were optimized to obtain simultaneously high yields of biomass  and high reduction activity . these results, which gave a more than 12-fold improvement in the yield of reduction activity per litre of culture, were expected to facilitate use of acetobacter sp. cctcc m <dig> cells in the production of chiral alcohols as building blocks for many industries.
