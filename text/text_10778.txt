BACKGROUND
plants respond to external signals by activating signaling pathways that rapidly alter physiological reactions and transcription rates of responding genes. the molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression are coordinated at the genome level where the accessibility of dna sequences is determined by the structure of chromatin. chemical modifications of the histone amino-terminal tails are implicated in facilitating nucleosome remodeling and repositioning, and in the recruitment of specific transcription factors. changes in dna methylation and/or histone modifications are associated with altered gene expression under various stresses in plant and cell culture systems  <cit> . changes in nucleosome occupancy and in the levels of histone h <dig> tri-methylation  or acetylation  during dehydration stress occurred at four inducible arabidopsis genes  <cit> . dehydration stress induces biosynthesis of abscisic acid , which as a second messenger activates signaling cascades that trigger stomatal closure and altered gene expression via chromatin remodeling. in turn, aba regulation is achieved through genetic and chromatin modification mechanisms  <cit> . thus, chromatin structure and chromatin modifications are emerging as critical factors in plants' responses to environmental cues.

it is important to note, however, that currently available data describe histone modifications only at individual stress-induced plant genes. we also have limited knowledge of chromatin modifications taking place at genes whose transcription has been down-regulated. moreover, there are no data on global modification trends occurring during the reprogramming of the entire genome in response to stress.

here, we provide a genome-wide view and analysis of the histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> mono-, di-, and tri-methylation  patterns in chromatin isolated from arabidopsis rosette leaves before and after dehydration stress. genome-wide transcript patterns in watered and dehydration stressed plants were compared with changes in the h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> levels of nucleosomes associated with responding genes. using chromatin immunoprecipitation  with h3k <dig> methylation specific antibodies and genome-wide sequencing , we revealed different dynamics and different magnitudes of the changes in h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> profiles taking place upon dehydration stress. we demonstrate specific patterns of the h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> distributions at up-regulated, down-regulated, and unaffected genes during the stress.

methods
plant materials and growth conditions
col- <dig> plants were grown in  <dig> h light for  <dig> weeks in pots with soil covered with miracloth to prevent soil contamination of leaf tissues at harvest. control plants continued to receive water while water was withheld from water-deficit treated plants until a relative water content  of 65% was reached in  <dig> to  <dig> days. vegetative rosettes were harvested and frozen for rna isolation or immediately fixed in formaldehyde for isolation of chromatin as described below.

isolation and immunoprecipitation of chromatin
watered or water-deficit treated vegetative tissues were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for  <dig> min after vacuum infiltration of the tissues in phosphate buffered saline  with  <dig> % silwet. fixation was stopped by quenching with  <dig> mm glycine. next, the tissue was rinsed twice in ice cold water, blotted dry and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. chromatin was isolated and resuspended in  <dig> μl nuclei lysis buffer as described by  <cit>  and sonicated for four  <dig> sec pulses using a branson sonifier  <dig> at an output between  <dig> - 15%. the sheared chromatin was used in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays as described  <cit>  with some modifications. in brief,  <dig> μl of sheared chromatin was diluted in  <dig> μl chip dilution buffer and precleared, using  <dig> μl of protein a dynabeads . protein a beads were collected using a magnet, and the precleared chromatin was incubated overnight at  <dig> °c with antibodies against either h <dig> , mono-methylated h3k <dig> , dimethylated h3k <dig> , or trimethylated h3k <dig> . western blotting of the h3k <dig> methylation antibodies against mono-, di- or tri-methylated h3k <dig> or monomethylated h3k <dig> synthetic peptides was performed and confirmed their expected specificity . a sample without antibody addition was also used as a control. next the antibody/chromatin complex was precipitated by incubating the mix with  <dig> μl of protein a beads for  <dig> h followed by collection of the beads using a magnet. the beads were washed, chromatin eluted, and dna de-crosslinked using procedures as described  <cit> . dna was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of novagen pellet paint  and resuspended in  <dig> μl of te buffer. purified dna was end modified, ligated to amplification primers, amplified, and sequenced according to the manufacturer's protocols .

rna isolation and labeling
total rna was extracted from the frozen rosette tissues using grinding and trizol  reagent. three independent replicates of watered and dehydration-stressed tissues were used. fifteen μg of total rna from each sample was used to produce labeled crna for hybridization to affymetrix arabidopsis ath microarrays using the manufacturer's protocols .

microarray data analysis
affymetrix® genechip operating software  generated the image and probe set signal values as cel files, which were loaded into rosetta resolver® . the water deficit and control condition replicate arrays were combined into their respective intensity profiles, and subsequently used to generate ratio experiments in rosetta resolver and analyzed using the software's background correction, normalization, and proprietary ratio error model  <cit> . the gene expression arrays have been submitted to the ncbi gene expression omnibus under gse <dig> .

computational methods for the analysis of sequence data
the primary analysis of the illumina genome analyzer output was performed by the manufacturer's eland program. eland mapped sequencing reads of  <dig> bases uniquely to the arabidopsis genome with no more than  <dig> mismatches. as a quality control, we used blast  <cit>  to re-map all reads to the arabidopsis genome  <cit>  with a word length of  <dig> bases and low-complexity filtering turned off. this analysis revealed a small number of further non-unique sequencing reads. from the remaining reads that uniquely map to the genome with no more than  <dig> mismatches, the coverage of each genomic position by the sequencing reads was computed. the dna sequencing reads for total genomic dna from arabidopsis thaliana cultivar col- <dig> were obtained and mapped to the arabidopsis thaliana col- <dig> genome, which is used as the control data set. to check for biases in illumina sequencing, the distribution of sequencing coverage along the genome was calculated. statistical analyses were performed in matlab . tests for the statistical significance in the difference in the coverage profiles of h3k4me <dig> along the normalized gene length between the sets of all expressed and aba induced genes under both watered and soil water deficit conditions were performed by the non-parametric wilcoxon rank sum test on the total  coverage over the normalized gene length for individual genes.

coverage peaks were identified as maximal scoring segments using a modified dynamic programming algorithm, analogous to pairwise local alignments  <cit> . background noise was estimated as the mean coverage of the intergenic regions  and was subtracted from the raw coverage values. we extended peaks from each genomic position that had an above background coverage so as to reach the maximum of the cumulative coverage, analogous to the cumulative score of a blast high-scoring segment pair. during peak extension, we allowed for local drops in the peaks provided that they were compensated by subsequent above-background regions.

position-wise coverage data for the three h3k <dig> methylation levels for watered and dehydration-stressed conditions, peak calls, our gene expression results, exons, utrs, alternative transcription start sites are displayed in the implementation of the uc santa cruz genome browser  <cit>  at the bioinformatics core facility at the university of nebraska-lincoln. exons, transcription start sites and untranslated regions were downloaded from the tair  <cit> ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/genes/. the results can be accessed at: http://bioinformatics.unl.edu/h3k4me/cgi-bin/hggateway. the chip-seq data has been deposited at the ncbi gene expression omnibus under series record gse <dig> .

RESULTS
changes in gene expression in plants exposed to soil water deficit conditions
plants were watered or subjected to dehydration stress by withholding water until a relative water content  of 65% was reached. a rwc of 65% causes leaf wilting and is considered a moderate level of dehydration stress  <cit> . the mrnas from rosette leaves of non-stressed  and dehydration-stressed arabidopsis plants were analyzed by microarrays . further analysis indicated  <dig> genes increased, and  <dig> genes decreased, their transcript levels by 4-fold or more  as result of the dehydration stress . analysis of the most highly represented gene categories  indicated that the majority of the genes with altered expression was involved in various stress-responses . for example, within the list of genes responding to dehydration-stress, many genes have been also recognized as components of pathways stimulated by cold, temperature, light, and radiation , by hormones, endogenous, and chemical stimuli , as well as genes encoding transcription factors and regulators . genes for metabolic enzymes, and for oxidoreductase functions, were also affected . among the genes up-regulated by dehydration stress, well-known genes implicated in this response in other studies were present, including genes abf <dig> , cbf <dig> , rd <dig> , rd29a , rd29b , athb <dig>  and athb <dig> .

genome-wide distributions of h <dig> and mono-, di-, and tri-methylated h3k <dig> in watered and in dehydration stressed plants
to examine whether and how chromatin reacted during the stress response at the whole-genome level, we used chip-seq to analyze the changes in the global chromatin methylation marks on h3k <dig> between the watered and dehydration stressed samples . the chip-seq chromatin data was visualized using a local implementation of the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . a representative chromosomal region demonstrating the types of coverage obtained from total input dna, and from antibodies to total h <dig> or specific to mono-, di- or tri-methylated h3k <dig> is shown . the antibodies for the h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> forms of h <dig> were analyzed for their ability to recognize a panel of peptides containing these modifications. the antibodies to h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> were highly specific, while the antibody to h3k4me <dig> had weak recognition of h3k4me <dig> . this weak cross reactivity did not appear to affect the chip-seq results as the profile of h3k4me <dig> was very different than the profile of h3k4me <dig> . samples containing total input dna , or dna from samples immunoprecipitated with antibody that recognized h <dig> regardless of its methylation state, did not show the gene-centric enrichment identified by the antibodies to the methylated forms of h3k <dig> . the distributions of the methylated forms of h3k <dig> were further analyzed below. the accuracy of the chip-seq method was verified by quantitative pcr  of arbitrarily selected gene regions  and a comparison of the data sets indicated they had a good quantitative agreement, with a correlation coefficient of  <dig> .

a detailed analysis of the genomic locations of the peaks of h3k <dig> methylation indicated that the majority of the peaks mapped to genes. the percentage of the peaks for the individual mono-, di-, or tri-methylated h3k <dig> types that were located on gene regions ranged from 80% to 88% of the total peaks . although the majority of peaks mapped to genes, not all genes contained each type of h3k <dig> methylation: the percentage of genes containing mono-, di-, or tri-methylation of h3k <dig> ranged from  <dig> to 84% .  <dig> % of annotated genes did not contain any form of h3k <dig> methylation . the majority of the genes lacking any type of h3k <dig> methylation were in the two lowest expression quintiles .

1h3k <dig> methylation region analyzed includes  <dig> bp upstream and downstream of the transcribed regions of  <dig>  annotated genes.

genome-wide distribution of histone h <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  me <dig> and me <dig> at gene sequences: correlation with transcription activity
next, we examined how overall gene transcription activity was associated with h <dig> or h3k <dig> methylation levels on genes. genes were grouped into expression quintiles based on their transcript levels. the amount of h <dig> or mono-, di-, or tri-methylated h3k <dig> was plotted at their 5'- and 3'-ends . we observed that histone h <dig> occupancy was slightly enriched within genes . there was a significant dip in the h <dig>  occupancy immediately 5' of the transcription start site  for the highly expressed genes . this region could correspond to a nucleosome free region  that occurs at actively transcribed genes  <cit> . at the 3'-end of the genes, this transcriptional effect on h <dig> levels was much less pronounced.

the profiles of mono-, di-, and tri-methylated h3k <dig> displayed specific patterns associated with transcript levels. h3k4me <dig> levels remained fairly constant throughout genes . one pattern of interest was that the 5'-regions of the genes with the lowest expression levels had higher h3k4me <dig> levels than more highly expressed genes . the profiles of h3k4me <dig> distribution had no correlation with transcript levels, and were relatively constant throughout the transcribed regions . as such, h3k4me <dig> marked 84% of genes  irrespective of the transcript levels produced from these genes. both h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> were fairly constant across the middle and end of the genes, and accurately marked the ends of the genes.

in contrast, the h3k4me <dig> distribution showed a clear peak around  <dig> bp downstream of the tss. however, the magnitudes of signal values for the five expression-based quintiles were in reverse to those displayed by h3k4me1: the highest h3k4me <dig> peaks were for genes with the highest transcript levels. the h3k4me <dig> signal at the 5'-ends of the least actively transcribed genes displayed the lowest coverage values . characteristically, the peak of h3k4me <dig> distribution tapers off towards the 3' end of the genes and reaches intergenic levels at the 3'-gene ends.

h3k <dig> methylation changes when transcript levels change
to determine whether/how stress-altered gene expression correlated with changes in h3k <dig> methylation, we examined genes whose transcripts increased or decreased by 4-fold or more, and had highly significant p-values . the  <dig> genes meeting these criteria were sorted into five up-regulated and five down-regulated change-of-expression quintiles, i.e., the genes with the biggest increase or decrease in transcript levels were in the highest  up or down regulated change-of-expression quintile, respectively. the median and range of changes in h3k4me <dig>  me <dig>  or me <dig> methylation amounts were plotted for each of the up- and down-regulated expression quintiles . the median h3k4me <dig> levels slightly decreased as the magnitude of the up-regulated transcript changes increased and slightly increased as the magnitude of the transcript reductions increased. thus, h3k4me <dig> levels were inversely or negatively associated with changes in transcript levels. the median for the h3k4me <dig> values slightly decreased for up-regulated quintiles, and was little changed for down-regulated quintiles .

the most significant changes were displayed by the h3k <dig> tri-methylation profiles. the median and the majority of the genes within one standard deviation of the median increased for all up-regulated quintiles and decreased for all down regulated quintiles . in addition, the largest increase in h3k4me <dig> levels was found on nucleosomes of the genes in the highest expression quintile, indicating that the magnitude of the h3k4me <dig> increase was positively associated with increased transcript levels. similarly, the down-regulated quintile with the largest decrease in transcript levels had the largest decrease in h3k4me <dig> levels .

as a control for our method of analysis, we analyzed genes that did not change transcript levels and found that these genes did not show significant variation in their h3k <dig> methylation levels. correlation coefficients of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were observed between the watered and dehydration-stressed samples for the h3k <dig> mono-, di-, or tri-methylation comparisons of genes that did not change transcript levels, respectively. these high correlation coefficients indicated that there was very little change in h3k <dig> methylation in this set of genes .

h3k <dig> methylation profiles of selected genes during watered or dehydration stressed conditions
a specific chromosomal region of interest demonstrating changes in h3k <dig> methylation status after dehydration stress is the region containing the aba and dehydration-induced genes rd29a  and rd29b . microarray data indicated that transcript levels of rd29a and rd29b were induced  <dig> and  <dig> fold by dehydration stress, respectively . the neighboring genes  did not change their expression  or h3k <dig> methylation levels. rd29a had a higher basal transcription rate than rd29b in the watered control treatment and had a higher basal level of h3k4me <dig>  their expression increased during dehydration stress as did the h3k4me <dig> levels on the nucleosomes of both genes. there was a corresponding decrease in h3k4me <dig> levels while h3k4me <dig> levels showed little change.

similar tendencies were demonstrated by other dehydration stress responsive genes as well. six representative chromosomal regions, representing genes that were induced, repressed, or unaffected by dehydration stress conditions, are shown in a ucsc genome browser view . for induced genes, the h3k4me <dig> levels increased during dehydration stress as their expression increased, with a corresponding decrease in h3k4me <dig>  while h3k4me <dig> levels showed little change . the two dehydration-stress repressed genes showed decreased h3k4me <dig> levels, and a slight increase in h3k4me <dig> . by comparison, genes without changes in gene expression did not display significant changes in any of the h3k <dig> methylation-forms . collectively, the changes, or lack of changes, in the h3k <dig> methylation patterns displayed at individual gene loci were consistent with the overall genomic patterns as described above.

dehydration stress responsive genes show broader h3k4me <dig> distribution profiles
inspection of individual dehydration-stress induced genes indicated the h3k4me <dig> distribution at these genes tended to be distributed over longer gene regions when compared to the h3k4me <dig> patterns at unresponsive genes . we then asked how general this broader h3k4me <dig> distribution pattern was for induced genes. to accomplish this, we measured the profiles of h3k4me <dig> modification along the length of three groups of genes: all expressed genes, dehydration-induced genes, and the subset of dehydration induced genes that were also aba induced  <cit> . the median values of h3k4me <dig> modification along the length of these genes were then plotted to a gene length normalized to  <dig> bp. these profiles were plotted with their actual median coverage levels or with each peak normalized to the same maximum level for a better relative comparison . the profiles for the dehydration or dehydration/aba induced genes are also shown for the watered condition for these genes as well . all five curves of h3k4me <dig> levels for the three sets of genes had peaks about  <dig> bp downstream of the tss and then progressively declined towards the stop codon of the genes. however, the profile for all expressed genes showed a faster decrease in h3k4me <dig> levels, while the dehydration-induced or subset of known aba-induced genes demonstrated a broader h3k4me <dig> distribution pattern . this broader distribution of h3k4me <dig> was significant for the dehydration/aba induced genes . surprisingly, this broad h3k4me <dig> distribution was also significant  for these genes in the watered condition prior to dehydration stress. this suggests that some biological feature of the dehydration/aba induced genes causes these broader than normal h3k4me <dig> distributions in both the watered and dehydration/aba induced states.

discussion
here we report the first whole genome map of the histone h3k <dig> methylation patterns of chromatin during a plant's response to dehydration stress. using the chip-seq approach, we found that the distribution of mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of h3k <dig> in arabidopsis were predominantly located on genes, in general agreement with prior studies  <cit> . however, in watered plants we identified  <dig>  genes carrying h3k4me <dig> versus  <dig>  genes found by the chip-chip method;  <dig>  genes with the h3k4me <dig> mark versus  <dig> , and  <dig>  h3k4me3-tagged genes versus  <dig>  genes reported in  <cit> . furthermore, our results indicated that only 10% of expressed genes did not contain at least one h3k4me type, while ~1/ <dig> of the genes was found to be free of h3k <dig> methylation by the chip-chip approach. these differences might reflect different sensitivities of the two methods and/or different tissue distributions in the whole seedlings  <cit> versus rosette leaves analyzed . the gene-associated location of h3k4me modifications did not change during the dehydration stress-responding process. within this gene-centric framework, however, the abundances of the individual forms of h3k <dig> methylation displayed specific profile changes associated with altered transcription from these genes.

h <dig> distribution and nucleosome free regions
the genome-wide distribution of histone h <dig> was used to gain insight to whether a region lacked nucleosomes or lacked h3k <dig> methylation of those nucleosomes. the h <dig> distribution showed a fairly continuous presence across genic and intergenic regions. by contrast, the h3k <dig> methylated forms were practically absent from intergenic regions. in agreement with observations made in yeast  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , we also observed an h <dig> enrichment in gene regions relative to intergenic regions. furthermore, in agreement with other genomic analyses in arabidopsis  <cit> , our analysis of the h <dig> profiles in genes grouped by transcript levels, revealed regions with low h <dig> presence, "nucleosome free regions" , identified immediately upstream of the tss for more highly expressed genes. nfrs have also been observed in yeast  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and human cells  <cit> . interestingly, nucleosome density has also been observed to be different in exon and intron gene regions  <cit> . it has been suggested that the nucleosome occupancy is influenced by the dna sequence, which might facilitate nucleosome removal upon transcription  <cit> . our finding that nfrs are associated with transcriptionally active genes is consistent with the idea of nucleosome displacement by transcription factors  <cit>  or complexes involved in transcription  <cit> . similarly, transcription from the arabidopsis ap <dig>  a gene required for the initiation of flowering, requires the reprogramming of the ap <dig> locus to an actively transcribed state that is accompanied by the removal of a nucleosome from the transcription start site and its dynamic re-positioning in a developmentally regulated process  <cit> .

h3k4me <dig> distribution changes
the majority of genes with increased transcript levels showed modest reductions in h3k4me <dig> levels. conversely, the most strongly down-regulated genes showed an increase in h3k4me <dig> marks, while genes with smaller reductions in transcript levels did not detectably change their average h3k4me <dig> levels. a negative association of h3k4me <dig> levels with increased transcription might be due to conversion to the more abundant h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> forms at higher transcription rates. alternatively, higher h3k4me <dig> levels, particularly near the tss, might repress transcription. a repressive role has been reported in chlamydomonas where h3k <dig> mono-methylation was found associated with repressed transgenes and transposable elements. the loss of this mark in chlamydomonas mutant mut <dig> resulted in expression of these genes  <cit> . the possible role of h3k4me <dig> in gene repression might be unique to the plant kingdom as h3k4me <dig> levels are associated with enhancers in animal cells  <cit> .

h3k4me <dig> distribution changes
in our studies, 84% of arabidopsis genes carried h3k4me <dig> marks, and on average, these marks were distributed relatively uniformly along gene sequences. in agreement with an earlier genomic study  <cit> , h3k4me <dig> levels were not associated with transcript levels in watered plants. in response to dehydration stress, h3k4me <dig> levels were only slightly reduced when transcript levels increased, and showed little change when transcript levels were reduced. previous chip-pcr analysis of individual genes in arabidopsis found that h3k4me <dig> marked 5' boundaries of the tested genes regardless of expression levels  <cit> . these observations suggest h3k4me <dig> marks do not correlate with transcript levels and may play a role in gene regulation different from the roles of mono-, and tri-methylated nucleosomes.

h3k4me <dig> distribution changes
h3k4me <dig> modification was predominantly associated with actively transcribed genes. our observation that higher h3k4me <dig> levels were associated with higher transcript levels was in agreement with studies in yeast  <cit> , rice  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and human cells  <cit> . this tendency was dynamic, as we found up-regulated genes had increased h3k4me <dig> levels, and down-regulated genes had reduced h3k4me <dig> levels. these findings are in agreement with numerous results from individual plant genes, where h3k4me <dig> was found to increase with increased transcription at dehydration induced promoters  <cit> , or the phaseolin  <cit> , alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  and pyruvate decarboxylase  <dig>  genes  <cit> . the magnitude of the change, however, only weakly correlated with the magnitude of the change in transcript levels as shown by the wide range of h3k4me <dig> values in each expression quintile .

the genome-wide h3k4me <dig> distribution in arabidopsis displays a peak at + <dig> bp relative to the tss , similar to the location observed in human cells  <cit> , but slightly upstream of the peak location in rice observed at about + <dig> bp  <cit> . a surprising deviation from this pattern was the broad h3k4me <dig> distribution profiles present on many dehydration/aba inducible genes. interestingly, this broad pattern was present on many of these genes prior to their induction, although the lower h3k4me <dig> levels made this pattern less striking than in the induced state. for example, both rd29a and rd29b had low levels of h3k4me <dig> in a broad distribution pattern that was similar to the broad pattern of the higher levels of h3k4me <dig> observed during dehydration stress . although the occurrence of this pattern was statistically significant, its functional significance is unclear.

CONCLUSIONS
although there is a strong association of h3k4me <dig> with transcriptionally active genes, the biochemical roles of h3k4me <dig> are emerging as occurring predominantly after transcription initiation  <cit> . h3k4me <dig> marks are recognized by chromatin remodeling factors facilitating transcription by altering the structure, composition, and positioning of nucleosomes, by components of the spliceosome, and by proteins involved in mrna capping and stability  <cit> . recognition and binding to h3k4me <dig> has been traced to plant homeodomains or chromodomains present in these proteins  <cit> . additionally, in support of a post-transcriptional function, the yeast set <dig> h3k <dig> methyltransferase responsible for h3k4me <dig> modification is recruited to the + <dig> bp region of genes after transcription initiation in yeast  <cit> . elevated h3k4me <dig> levels occurring on genes with increased transcript production might effectively recruit more chromosomal and rna processing proteins, thereby facilitating the increased transcriptional activity on these induced genes.
