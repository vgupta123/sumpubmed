BACKGROUND
aspergillus fumigatus  is a saprophytic mould that is responsible for life-threatening invasive pulmonary diseases in immunocompromised hosts. in general, a. fumigatus is propagated through airborne conidia  <cit> . despite the availability of new antifungal drugs, the number of deaths due to invasive aspergillosis has progressively increased in the last decades with a rise in the number of immunosuppressed patients in modern clinical practices  <cit> . therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for resistance to aspergillus infection is required. the respiratory epithelium plays an important role in the innate immune defence against various inhaled pathogens by sensing the signal from the external environment and stimulating the synthesis of the antimicrobial molecules directly affecting the microbes  <cit> . the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides is an evolutionary conserved group of small cationic peptides involved in the innate immune system of plants and animals. they are divided into α-, β- and θ-defensins, which differ from one another by the spacing and connectivity of their six cystein residues  <cit> . it was found that α-defensins are generally stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and peneth cells of the small intestine  <cit> . defensins isolated from rhesus monkey neutrophils are referred to as θ-defensins because of their circular molecular structure  <cit> . human β-defensins  are characteristic of epithelial tissue; they have been identified by traditional peptide purification, genomics-based searches  <cit>  and an orfeome-based peptide database search  <cit> . some of these defensins are tissue-specific, whereas others are expressed in the epithelium of different origins: hbd <dig> is expressed in most epithelial cells  <cit> , while hbd <dig> is most commonly expressed in the lung and thymus  <cit> . newly discovered defensin hbd <dig> was found to be ubiquitously expressed in most tissues  <cit> . inducible hbd <dig> expression by the epithelial cells exposed to microbial pathogens is well documented  <cit> . the direct killing of microorganisms has been ascribed to human defensins  <cit> . it was recently recognised that defensins have additional activities such as the chemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, t cells and monocytes, as well as activation of the professional antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . killing of a. fumigatus by rabbit neutrophil cationic peptides  <cit> , as well as antifungal activities of hbd <dig> against a. fumigatus  <cit> , has been reported in in vitro experiments. moreover, the expression of human drosomycin-like defensins, which display a broad spectrum of activity against aspergillus spp, was found in several human tissues  <cit> .

the role of the airway epithelium is not limited to the first mechanical barrier, but instead involves a complex interaction with a. fumigatus  <cit> . we hypothesized that various defensins may be expressed by the respiratory epithelium exposed to a. fumigatus. taking the possibility into account that some host immunological reactions are a. fumigatus morphotype-specific  <cit> , the present study has been designed to investigate the expression of defensins by human pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells exposed to different forms of a. fumigatus: rc, sc or hf. the expression of previously studied hbd <dig>  <cit>  and hbd <dig>  <cit> , as well as recently discovered hbd <dig>  hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  <cit> , were analysed. since hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> were found to be highly expressed by cells exposed to a. fumigatus, those defensins were chosen for further analysis in the current study. the inducible expression of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> was revealed by rt-pcr in airway epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus organisms. real time pcr demonstrated that the expression was higher in cells exposed to sc, compared to rc or hf. the presence of the intracellular hbd <dig> peptide was demonstrated using immunofluorescence. the hbd <dig> level was highest in the supernatants of cells exposed to sc, as determined by sandwich elisa. furthermore, it was found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in the regulation of defensin expression. detection of inducible defensin expression in human airway primary culture epithelial cells was proof of the biological significance of obtained results. our finding that hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> are expressed and produced  in human respiratory epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus is novel and indicates that respiratory epithelium might play an important role in the early immune response during aspergillus infection.

RESULTS
expression of defensins by human pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus
the expression of human defensins, hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  and newly described hbd <dig>  hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  by the human pneumocytes a <dig> and bronchial epithelial cells 16hbe exposed to sc, rc or hf of a. fumigatus in the presence of fetal calf serum was analysed by rt-pcr performed under the conditions presented in table  <dig>  the powerful defensin inductor, il-1β, was used in experiments as a positive control. the cells were exposed either to  <dig> of a. fumigatus conidia,  <dig> μl of a. fumigatus hf solution, or  <dig> ×  <dig> latex beads for  <dig> h. compared to the control samples containing the untreated cells, an inducible expression of human beta defensins   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by 16hbe cells exposed to il-1β was observed . exposure of the cells to all of the morphotypes of a. fumigatus resulted in the strong inducible expression of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  in contrast to the exposure of the cells to the  <dig> ×  <dig> latex beads. the expression of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> by cells exposed to a. fumigatus was not observed in the present study. the constitutive expression of human beta defensin <dig>  was found in the current experiment. since polymixin b drastically inhibits endotoxin activity,  <dig> μg of polymixin b per ml were added to cells before exposure to a. fumigatus organisms in some experiments, according to the method described by mambula et al., in order to rule out endotoxin contamination  <cit> . this had no effect on defensin expression. similar results were observed for a <dig> cells . therefore, hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> were chosen for further analysis of defensin expression by 16hbe and a <dig> cells exposed to a. fumigatus.

role of serum in defensin expression by human pneumocytes and tracheal epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus
in order to investigate the potential role of the serum and to set up the experimental conditions necessary for analysing the inducible expression of defensins by the human respiratory epithelium exposed to a. fumigatus, 16hbe and a <dig> human airway epithelial cells were incubated with a. fumigatus organisms  or latex beads in the presence of either 10% heterologous fetal calf serum  or 5% autologous human serum. expression of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> was evaluated. as a positive control, il-1β was used in experiments. the cells were exposed to  <dig> of a. fumigatus conidia or  <dig> μl of a. fumigatus hf solution or  <dig> ×  <dig> latex beads for various periods from  <dig> h to  <dig> h. the representative results of defensin expression by the 16hbe cells exposed for  <dig> hours to a. fumigatus are shown in figure  <dig>  higher hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> gene expression was observed in the untreated control cells and the cells exposed to the latex beads in the presence of heterologous fcs , compared to the intensity of bands corresponding to hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> in the cells incubated in the presence of 5% autologous human serum . the treatment of the cells with il-1β, as well as exposure of cells to either hf or conidia of a. fumigatus, strongly induced the expression of both defensins by the cells incubated with human serum . similar results were observed with a <dig> cells. the exposure of both types of cells to  <dig> conidia resulted in defensin expression as well .

taking the lower basal level of defensin expression into account in untreated control cells maintained in the medium containing human serum compared to fcs, all of the following experiments, unless otherwise specified, were performed with human respiratory cells incubated in the presence of 5% human serum.

the identities of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> defensins were confirmed by direct sequencing of the products of predicted molecular weight generated by pcr amplification using upstream pcr primers.

effect of heat inactivation of serum on inducible defensin expression
the mechanisms of regulation of beta defensin expression by airway epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus organisms are unknown; the autocrine mechanism of defensin induction by cytokines cannot be ruled out. it was reported that aspergillus induced cytokine production whereas heat inactivation of serum decreased cytokine production  <cit> . we therefore checked to see of the heat-labile serum factor was required for defensin expression. to do this, human 16hbe cells were incubated either with heterologous fcs or autologous human serum  and simultaneously exposed for  <dig> hours either to a. fumigatus conidia, hf or the latex beads.

as shown in figure  <dig>  a high level of hbd <dig>  as well as hbd <dig> expression, was observed in the cells incubated either with fcs  or human serum . heat inactivation of any of the serums led to the partial decrease of the expression of both of the tested defensins by cells exposed either to a. fumigatus conidia, hf, or to il-1β .

kinetics of defensin expression by cells exposed to a. fumigatus organisms
to analyse the kinetics of defensin expression, cells were exposed to a. fumigatus for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours, and the expression of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> was examined. as a positive control, il-1β-treated cells were examined. as a negative control, untreated cells or cells exposed to  <dig> ×  <dig> latex beads were analysed as well. according to the results presented on figure  <dig>  the expression of both defensins, hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  were induced in the 16hbe cells treated with il-1β either for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours. no hbd <dig> expression was detected after a 4-h exposure by 16hbe to sc, rc or hf of a. fumigatus, in contrast to hbd <dig> expression by cells exposed to all morphotypes of a. fumigatus for the same period. incubation of the cells with both types of conidia or hf for  <dig> h resulted in a low level of hbd <dig> expression and a high level of hbd <dig> expression, comparable to expression by the cells treated with the positive control, il-1β. exposure of the cells to conidia or hf for  <dig> h led to the high expression of both defensins, hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  exposure of the cells to the latex beads did not induce the defensin expression in any of the experiments. the constitutive expression of hbd <dig> by the cells exposed either to the different morphotypes of a. fumigatus or to the latex beads for the various periods was observed in the current experiment.

similar kinetics of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> expression was observed with a <dig> cells .

real time pcr
the relative level of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> expression in 16hbe and a <dig> cells exposed to different a. fumigatus morphotypes for  <dig> hours was quantified by real time pcr. the expression of both defensins was higher in il-1β stimulated cells than in the control, as shown for 16hbe cells in figure  <dig>  exposure of 16hbe cells to sc resulted in a statistically significant increase of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> expression compared to that of the untreated control cells or the cells exposed to the latex beads. the increase of defensin expression was also found in the cells exposed to rc and hf. however, this difference was significant only for hbd <dig> in the cells exposed to rc. the difference in expression of hbd <dig> by the cells exposed to rc and in the expression of hbd <dig> as well as hbd <dig> by the cells exposed to hf did not reach a significant level. there was no difference between defensin expression in the untreated control cells and the cells exposed to the latex beads. similar results were obtained with a <dig> cells.

neutralising anti-interleukine-1β antibody decreased defensin expression in cells exposed to swollen conidia
since a. fumigatus has been shown to induce il-1β in airway epithelium, and since the analysis of kinetic of defensin expression showed that the il-1β-induced response was faster than the one induced by fungi , we investigated whether or not observed a. fumigatus-induced defensin expression was related to il- <dig> β synthesized during anti-fungal response. for this reason, neutralising anti-interleukine-1β antibody was added to the cells before exposure to a. fumigatus organisms. one of the defensins, hbd- <dig>  was chosen for real time pcr analysis of the role of il- <dig> β in defensin expression. the results of real time pcr revealed that relative gene expression was statistically significantly decreased in the cells treated with anti-il- <dig> β antibody before exposure to sc, compared to the cells only exposed to sc . relative gene expression was also decreased in the cells treated with anti-il- <dig> β antibody before exposure to rc or hf, but the difference did not reach a statistically significant level. the pre-treatment of the cells with normal mouse immunoglobulin before exposure to a. fumigatus organisms had no effect on defensin expression.

analysis of defensin expression by human primary airway epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus conidia or hyphal fragments
to provide evidence for the biological significance of the discovered phenomenon, we verified whether or not inducible defensin expression was observed in the human primary airway epithelial cells, in addition to the detected defensin expression in airway cell lines a <dig> and 16hbe . airway epithelial cells obtained from human nasal turbinates  of patients undergoing turbinectomy were exposed to rc, sc or hf or latex beads for  <dig> hours. examination of hbd <dig> or hbd <dig> expression showed that both defensins were detected by rt-pcr in the primary culture cells exposed to all of the morphotypes of a. fumigatus . the relative level of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> expression in hnt cells was quantified by real time pcr. the expression of both defensins was higher in il-1β stimulated cells than in the control, as shown in figure  <dig>  exposure of hnt cells to sc resulted in a statistically significant increase of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> expression compared to that of the untreated control cells or the cells exposed to the latex beads. the increase of defensin expression was also found in the cells exposed to rc and hf. however, this difference was significant only for hbd <dig> in the cells exposed to rc. the difference in expression of hbd <dig> by the cells exposed to rc and in the expression of hbd <dig> as well as hbd <dig> by the cells exposed to hf did not reach a significant level. there was no difference between defensin expression in the untreated control cells and the cells exposed to the latex beads.

detection of the hbd <dig> peptide in human airway epithelial cells by immunofluorescence
to determine if defensin peptides were present in the airway epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus, the hbd <dig> peptide was detected by immunofluorescence. analysis of the hbd <dig> peptide was not performed since anti-hbd <dig> antibodies were not available. a <dig> or 16hbe cells were cultured on cover slips, subsequently exposed to either sc, rc, hf, latex beads or treated with il-1β for  <dig> h, and stained with polyclonal anti-hbd <dig> antibody as described in methods. as shown in figure 7a, hbd <dig> was detected in the cytoplasm of airway epithelial 16hbe cells exposed to any of the morphotypes of a. fumigatus, but generally not in the untreated control culture or in the cells exposed to the latex beads, except for several individual cells that contained some amount of defensin peptides. these findings are consistent with the inducible expression of hbd <dig>  staining revealed the punctuated distribution of peptides in the cytoplasm with a concentration in the perinuclear region. it should be observed that the expression of the hbd <dig> peptide was not detected in each cell of the sample exposed to a. fumigatus. quantification of the differences in the number of cells detected with anti-defensin- <dig> antibody showed that the number of stained cells in the untreated control culture was  <dig> ± 4%. the percentage of stained cells increased to  <dig> ±  <dig> % after il- <dig> β-treatment, to  <dig> ±  <dig> % after exposure to rc, to  <dig> ±  <dig> % after exposure to sc and to  <dig> ±  <dig> % after exposure to hf, while exposure to the latex beads did not affect defensin expression  . similar results were obtained with a <dig> cells .

co-localisation of hbd- <dig> and different a. fumigatus morphotypes
previous experiments showed that human airway epithelial cells a <dig> internalised a. fumigatus conidia; a phagocytosis rate of 30% has been reported  <cit> . more then 50% of internalised conidia were found to co-localise after  <dig> hours with lysosomal proteins, cd <dig> and lamp- <dig>  which revealed the maturation of late endosome into lysosomes  <cit> . similar results were obtained with primary human nasal epithelial cells. staining of the cells with antibody against lamp- <dig> demonstrated a positive immunofluorescence signal around digested a. fumigatus conidia  <cit> . using the method described by these authors, we determined if different a. fumigatus morphotypes were co-localised with intracellular hbd- <dig>  labelling a <dig> cells with anti-hbd- <dig> antibody revealed cytoplasmic distribution of peptides. comparison of the image of a <dig> cells stained by anti-hbd- <dig> antibody and the phase-contrast image revealed a positive immunofluorescence signal around resting  or swollen  conidia. this suggests a co-localisation of hbd <dig> and digested rc or sc. in contrast, no positive immunofluorescence signal was detected around hf, whereas the cells were positively stained with anti-human hbd <dig> antibody . the normal rabbit serum control labels neither cytoplasm nor a. fumigatus morphotypes . similar results were obtained with  <dig> hbe cells.

quantification of hbd <dig> in cells supernatants by sandwich elisa
in order determine if synthesized hbd <dig> was released to cell supernatants, the level of hbd <dig> in the supernatants of 16hbe, a <dig> and hnt primary culture cells was evaluated by sandwich-elisa. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pg/ml of hbd <dig> were detected in the supernatants of il-1β-treated 16hbe, hnt and a <dig> cells, respectively. comparable levels of hbd <dig> were detected in the supernatants of all cells exposed to sc:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pg/ml were found in the supernatants of 16hbe, hnt and a <dig> cells, respectively, which was statistically significantly higher then hbd <dig> levels in the supernatants of the cells alone or the cells exposed to rc, hf or latex beads. exposure of any cells to rc or hf resulted in lower levels of hbd <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> pg/ml. the difference between hbd <dig> levels in the supernatants of the cells exposed to either rc, or those exposed to latex beads, was statistically significant for hnt cells, while this difference did not reach statistically a significant level for a <dig> and 16hbe cells. this could be explained by the different reactions of the different kinds of cells to the pathogen. the difference between hbd <dig> levels in the supernatants of 16hbe, hnt and a <dig> cells exposed to either rc, or those exposed to latex beads, was statistically insignificant.

analysis of hbd <dig> expression by airway epithelial cells exposed to live a. fumigatus
in order to determine if hbd <dig> expression was induced in the respiratory cells by live a. fumigatus organisms, rt-pcr and immunofluorescence analysis of cells exposed to unfixed  <dig> live conidia was performed. using microscopic observation, we first examined the development of a. fumigatus in the environment of the epithelial a <dig> or 16hbe cells. when the rc were added to the epithelial cells, they settled onto the cells within  <dig> minutes and began to swell after 3– <dig> hours; after  <dig> hours of infection, the sc became polarised and began to germinate. the germ tubes then progressively elongated, forming the hyphae: after  <dig> hours of infection, the hyphae had completely covered the epithelial cells .

rt-pcr analysis of the a <dig> cells exposed to live a. fumigatus rc for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours allows us to detect hbd <dig> expression after  <dig> hours of incubation , whereas no inducible hbd <dig> expression was observed after  <dig> or  <dig> hours of incubation . treatment of a <dig> cells either with il- <dig> β or tnf-α for  <dig> hours resulted in the inducible hbd <dig> expression. detection of hbd <dig> in epithelial cells exposed to live a. fumigatus conidia for  <dig> hours by the immunofluorescence method revealed punctuated distribution of peptides in the cytoplasm with a concentration in the perinuclear region, similar to the staining of hbd <dig> in cells exposed to ethanol-fixed conidia or hf . several individual cells were stained with anti-hbd <dig> antibody in the untreated control cells or in cells exposed to the latex beads. quantification of cells stained with hbd antibody revealed the increase in the number of stained cells from  <dig> ±  <dig> % in the untreated control cells to  <dig> ±  <dig> % in the il-1β-treated culture, to  <dig> ± 6% in tnf-treated culture and to  <dig> ±  <dig> % in the cells exposed to live a. fumigatus, compared to  <dig> ± 4% cells in the culture exposed to  <dig> ×  <dig> latex beads .

transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of defensin expression regulation
in order to determine if the observed increase of defensin  expression by cells exposed to a. fumigatus was related to transcriptional activation or enhanced stabilisation of mrna, 16hbe cells were pre-treated with  <dig>  μg of actinomycin d  per ml, or dmso ,  <dig> h before exposure of the cell to conidia or hf for an additional  <dig> or <dig> h, as described in the literature  <cit> . the viability of 16hbe cells and total rna yield were verified after each treatment, and there was no difference between treated and untreated control cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  exposure of the 16hbe cells either to dmso or act d resulted in almost no increase of defensin expression compared to control cells, while the expression of both defensins by the 16hbe cells exposed to the various forms of a. fumigatus conidia for either  <dig> or  <dig> h was inhibited by the pre-treatment of cells with act d. therefore, the data indicated that new gene transcription is required for hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> expression by cells exposed to a. fumigatus rc, sc or hf.

to determine if the increase in defensin mrna expression was dependent on protein synthesis, 16hbe cells were pre-treated with  <dig>  μg of cycloheximide , a protein synthesis inhibitor,  <dig> h before exposure to a. fumigatus. pre-treatment of the cells with only cxh did not change defensin expression, compared to control cells. in contrast, pre-treatment of 16hbe cells with cxh resulted in the inhibition of defensin expression after exposure to a. fumigatus . therefore, it could be hypothesized that protein synthesis might be required for induced accumulation of defensin mrna.

discussion
a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the defence against invasive aspergillus infection is required to develop strategies aimed at boosting the antifungal actions of the immune system. defensins, or antimicrobial peptides, which are implicated in potentiating innate and adaptive immunity  <cit>  in addition to direct antimicrobial activities  <cit> , would be a good candidate as a therapeutic agent for enhancing host defence mechanisms. since the invasion of the airway epithelium by a. fumigatus conidia may play an important role in the development of aspergillosis, we therefore investigated the involvement of defensins in the response of pneumocytes a <dig> and bronchial epithelial cells 16hbe exposed to a. fumigatus in this study. the expression of human defensins hbd <dig>  hbd <dig>  hbd <dig>  hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> was analysed. in agreement with earlier findings  <cit> , constitutive expression of hbd <dig> by the epithelial cells 16hbe and a <dig> was observed in our experiments. it was found that hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> are highly expressed by the epithelial respiratory cells exposed to sc, rc or hf of a. fumigatus, while hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> gene expression was not observed in the current study. previous investigations revealed that hbd <dig> was induced by various stimuli including microbes, cytokines and growth factors  <cit> . inducible expression of hbd <dig> defensins by airway epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus, observed in the present work, is therefore in agreement with earlier observations. the role of the recently discovered hbd <dig> in innate antimicrobial defence is not well determined; however, hbd <dig> gene regulation in gingival keratinocytes exposed to candida albicans has been described  <cit> . additional investigations are essential for a better understanding of its role in direct antimicrobial activity and its contribution to innate immunity. the role of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> in innate immunity of respiratory epithelium exposed to a. fumigatus cannot be ruled out before evaluation of other epithelial respiratory cells or other induction conditions. further analysis of those defensins is recommended.

we have shown that the maintenance of the human epithelial cells in the presence of preheated serum  resulted in the partial decrease of defensin expression. involvement of the heat-labile serum factor suggests the potential role of the complement for defensin expression. the possible link between the proteins of the complement system and defensin expression may be anticipated since the interaction between the defensins and proteins of the complement system was demonstrated. it was found that hbd <dig> inhibits the classical pathway of the complement system  <cit> . moreover, the interrelationship between the respiratory tract and the complement system was studied in an animal model  <cit> . the origin of complement proteins present in the lining fluid of the respiratory tract is thought to result mainly from plasma that exudes into the bronchoalveolar space. however, it was shown that human bronchial epithelial cells generate complement protein c3: the modulation of its expression by proinflammatory cytokines might be an additional regulatory mechanism of local airway defence during infection  <cit> .

furthermore, the kinetics of the expression of human beta defensins, hbd <dig> and hbd <dig>  by airway epithelial cells exposed to the deferent morphotypes of a. fumigatus was analysed. analysis of the kinetics of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> defensin expression by cells exposed to a. fumigatus showed the prompt inducible expression of hbd <dig>  following by delayed hbd <dig> expression. this could allow us to hypothesize that the host immune system may react against a. fumigatus by using the cascade of newly synthesized defensins that probably possess the different functions. however, this hypothesis would require further investigation at the protein level. our data are in agreement with the analysis of kinetics of hbd <dig> expression by a <dig> cells exposed to mycobacterium tuberculosis; infection of a <dig> cells resulted in hbd <dig> gene expression as early as  <dig> hours postinfection, while maximum expression was detected at  <dig> and  <dig> hours postinfection  <cit> .

several lines of evidence eliminated the possibility that observed inducible defensin expression was related to endotoxin contamination of a. fumigatus organisms. first, the addition of polymixin b  to the cells prior to exposure to a. fumigatus organisms did not have any effect on defensin expression. second, rigorous measures were undertaken to keep endotoxin out of the experimental system, including washing of a. fumigatus organisms with the solution containing polymixin b during preparation, utilisation of endotoxin-free plasticware and solutions in experiments, and washing of fungal organisms in endotoxin-free pbs prior to use.

the expression of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> was found to be higher in a <dig>  16hbe and primary culture hnt cells exposed to sc compared to rc or hf, as shown by quantitative pcr. during asexual growth, the morphological form of a. fumigatus changes from resting to swollen conidia, which then form germ tubes that continue growing in hyphal form. these transformations are accompanied by the modification of surface structures. the rc are covered with a proteinoceous layer that is disrupted during swelling, exposing the inner layer. therefore, the surfaces of various a. fumigatus morphotypes differ form each other and, consequently, the reaction of host cells may vary towards divergent a. fumigatus growth forms  <cit> . our findings suggest that infected hosts can discriminate between inactive rc and active potentially-invasive sc. the data are consistent with findings showing that sc , but not rc-activated nf-kβ, stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of reactive oxygen by host macrophages  <cit> .

moreover, the presence of the hbd <dig> peptide in the respiratory cells was investigated. detection of the hbd <dig> peptide by immunofluorescence in a <dig> and 16hbe cells exposed to the different forms of a. fumigatus confirmed its inducible expression in the infected cells. the presence of the negatively-stained cells in the infected culture may be due to defensin synthesis in the subpopulation of the epithelial cells or because of the release of synthesized defensins by the activated cells. the detection of the beta-defensin hbd <dig> peptide in the individual unstimulated control cells is in agreement with the observation made for the alpha-defensins; it has been reported that individual untreated hl- <dig> cells may contain variable amounts of alpha defensin, as assessed by immunostaining  <cit> . undoubtedly, inducible expression of defensin by cells exposed to a. fumigatus may represent the recruitment of additional cells that would synthesize antimicrobial peptides and further upregulation of defensin synthesis in cells that originally contained defensin. punctuated distribution of peptide in the cytoplasm of a <dig> and 16hbe cells with a concentration in the perinuclear region was similar to the staining of defensin expressed by human gingival epithelial cells exposed to cell wall extract of the gram-negative periodontal bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum  <cit> , suggesting that the mechanism of defensin expression may be universal for the different infectious agents. the punctuated perinuclear pattern of immunostaining may be related to the localisation of hbd <dig> in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus, which is in agreement with the previous observations of rahman et al., showing that the hbd <dig> peptide was expressed in rough endoplasmic reticulum, the golgi complex and cytoplasmic vesicles of human colon plasma cells  <cit> . quantification of the cells stained with anti-hbd <dig> antibody revealed that sc induced a greater number of cells that synthesized hbd <dig>  compared to rc and hf. analysis of hbd <dig> levels in the supernatants of a <dig>   <dig> hbe and primary culture hnt cells confirmed this observation; significantly higher hbd <dig> levels were detected in all tested cell supernatants exposed to sc, compared to those exposed to rc, hf or latex beads. the level of hbd <dig> detected in the cell supernatants does not exceed  <dig> pg/ml and was comparable to the level of hbd <dig> in cell supernatants exposed to other pathogens  <cit> . since okamoto et al. showed that the effective dose of synthetic hbd <dig> was  <dig>  μg/ml, we can hypothesize that the chemotactic activity of hbd <dig> rather then its direct antifungal activity plays a more important role in the protection of the infected host  <cit> . however, antifungal activity of defensins in synergy with other antifungal factors in vivo cannot be excluded.

co-localisation analysis of hbd <dig> and a. fumigatus morphotypes allow us to detect rc or sc stained with hbd <dig> antibody in contrast to hf; these observations confirm the different mechanism of hbd <dig> induction by various morphotypes. our findings are in agreement with the observations of lopez bezzera et al. who found that a. fumigatus conidia and hyphae injure endothelial cells via different mechanisms  <cit> . this difference between the different growth phases of a. fumigatus could be due to the discrepancy of the mechanisms of defensin induction, which may possibly be related to the diverse types/numbers of molecules involved in this process. immunofluorescence analysis of inducible hbd <dig> expression by cells exposed to live a. fumigatus organisms revealed the perinuclear staining of peptide, similar to the staining observed in cells exposed to fixed a. fumigatus, pointing to the biological significance of our findings. given the fact that conidia germinate and form hyphae after epithelial cells are exposed to live a. fumigatus conidia for  <dig> hours, in agreement with previous observation  <cit> , we can then hypothesize that defensin expression is possibly induced by different morphotypes in this experiment.

our observations of the induced defensin expression in the airway epithelial cells treated with il- <dig> β or tnf-α, the cytokines that play an important role during aspergillus infection  <cit> , suggest that defensin expression in infected cells may be induced by a. fumigatus organisms, as well as by the cytokines involved in the infectious process. therefore, the regulation of defensin expression during aspergillus infection may possibly depend on a variety of factors.

significant decrease of defensin expression by neutralising anti-il-1β antibody, added to the cells prior exposure to sc, reflects the autocrine mechanism of defensin induction. a statistically insignificant decrease of defensin expression in the cells treated with anti-il-1β antibody and exposed to rc or hf supported the hypothesis that the host immune system may distinguish and react differently towards divers aspergillus morphotypes.

finally, to better understand defensin synthesis, we investigated the involvement of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of defensin synthesis. the inducible expression of hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> by cells exposed to all morphotypes of a. fumigatus was inhibited by pre-treatment with actinomycin d, implying that defensin genes are regulated at the transcriptional level. the inhibitory effect of cycloheximide on defensin induction substantiates the requirement for new protein synthesis, which may include cell receptors, transcription factors or proteins that enhance mrna stability. thus, post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation were involved in the inducible expression of defensins as well.

CONCLUSIONS
while the direct fungicidal activity of hbd <dig> against a. fumigatus was revealed in the in vitro model  <cit> , this is the first study, according to our knowledge, showing hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> defensin expression by host airway epithelial cells exposed to a. fumigatus. defensin expression was higher in the cells exposed to sc than to rc or hf. moreover, the hbd <dig> level was elevated in the supernatants of cells exposed to sc, compared to other aspergillus morphotypes. our findings suggest that identification of the most invasive fungal form by the host may be beneficial for anti-fungal host response.

autocrine regulation of defensin expression in cells exposed to a. fumigatus was established in the experiments with neutralising anti-il-1β antibody. investigation of defensin expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level demonstrated the requirement of transcription as well as new protein synthesis during a. fumigatus defensin induction. the presence of defensin peptide hbd <dig> was revealed using immunofluorescence that showed a punctual cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining, suggestive of endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus localisation. the discovery of inducible hbd <dig> and hbd <dig> defensin expression by human primary respiratory culture cells is indicative of the biological significance of the observation. our finding provides evidence that respiratory epithelium might play an important role in the early immune response during aspergillus infection. taking the antimicrobial activity of defensins together with their capacity to induce the migration of cells involved in the immune response into account, we can hypothesize that defensins may link innate and acquired immunities of the host infected by a. fumigatus. future study of the regulation of defensin expression might provide new approaches that may enhance expression of antimicrobial peptides for potential therapeutic use during aspergillosis treatment.
