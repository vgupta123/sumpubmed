BACKGROUND
perioperative analgesia has become recognized as an important ethical responsibility of veterinarians over the last three decades. clinical evidence in dogs indicates that multimodal analgesia provides the most effective relief from postoperative pain  <cit> . one of the most effective means of preventing the transduction and transmission of nociceptive signals is through the use of local anesthetics. indeed, it is the authors’ opinion that the only currently available analgesics that can completely block perioperative pain are the local anesthetics. despite their potential efficacy, the relief provided by currently available local anesthetics is of limited duration, and this may be one factor contributing to the currently relatively low use of local anesthetics in small animal practice  <cit> . bupivacaine has the longest reported activity, potentially providing analgesia for as long as 6–7 h . however, currently the only method in veterinary medicine to extend the action of bupivacaine beyond this involves using a wound catheter, and instilling bupivacaine approximately every 6 h into the wound  <cit> .

in  <dig> the fda approved an extended-release formulation of bupivacaine, depofoam® bupivacaine <dig> for use as a single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to effect postsurgical analgesia in human surgical patients. the depofoam technology used in this product consists of multivesicular liposomes encapsulating aqueous bupivacaine. the liposomes are microscopic structures made of nonconcentric lipid bilayers designed such that bupivacaine is gradually released from vesicles over 96 h as the lipid bilayers break down. the lipids making up the bilayer structures consist of phospholipids, cholesterol and triglycerides, and importantly do not contain lecithin which has been associated with tissue necrosis and toxicity  <cit> . bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension  has been extensively studied in dogs as part of the development for human use  <cit> . bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, known as at- <dig> is currently being investigated for use in veterinary patients. in a preliminary laboratory study to assess the analgesic properties of at- <dig> following tissue infiltration around the site of stifle arthrotomy in beagle dogs, a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg was determined to provide adequate analgesia for at least 24 h post-surgery . the current report describes a pilot field study evaluating the post-operative analgesia provided by at- <dig> at a dose of up to  <dig>  mg/kg administered by tissue infiltration just prior to closure following cranial cruciate ligament  surgery in client-owned dogs, using subjective, in-clinic assessments of pain.

we hypothesized that  <dig>  mg/kg of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension would provide clinically effective analgesia, as measured using subjective clinical assessment, over a 72-h period following stifle surgery in dogs, when compared to a saline placebo.

RESULTS
three  investigative sites screened and enrolled cases. there were forty-nine  dogs screened and forty-six  dogs enrolled in the study over the period april  <dig> to september  <dig> and the study concluded when the target number of dogs was enrolled. all forty-six  dogs enrolled in the study were included in both the efficacy and safety evaluation . twenty-four  dogs were treated with at- <dig> and twenty-two  dogs with saline. the mean  age was  <dig>  years  for the at- <dig> group and  <dig>  years  for the saline placebo group. group characteristics are summarized in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> study participant flow diagram



cmps-sf scores
the mean total cmps-sf scores  at the baseline  evaluation were  <dig>   and  <dig>   for at- <dig> and saline placebo, respectively. following surgery, total cmps-sf scores  were consistently lower at all post-operative time points  for the at- <dig> treated dogs compared to saline placebo treated dogs, with a significant overall treatment effect  in favor of at- <dig>  at 72 h, the scores were similar, but only two dogs remained in the saline placebo group . there was no treatment by time effect , however there were only a small number of subjects remaining in the saline placebo group after 12 h. when site effect and treatment by site interaction were entered into the model, the overall treatment effect was again statistically significant , with lower cmps-sf scores in the at- <dig> group.table  <dig> total mean  cmps-sf scores by treatment group and time point

surgical site manipulation scores
the mean surgical site manipulation scores   at the baseline  evaluation were  <dig>   and  <dig>   for at- <dig> and saline placebo, respectively. following treatment, the mean scores for at- <dig> were less than those for placebo at each evaluation time point except at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 h , however, there were only two placebo dogs left in the study at 54 h. the overall treatment effect showed no statistically significant difference between treatment groups , however when site effect and treatment by site interaction were entered into the model, the overall treatment effect was statistically significant , with lower surgical site manipulation scores in the at- <dig> group.table  <dig> total mean  surgical site manipulation scores by treatment group & time point

success/failure analysis
dogs receiving at- <dig> were more likely to remain in the study  following the surgical procedure than dogs receiving the saline placebo. at 72 h post-operatively,  <dig> of  <dig> at- <dig> dogs and  <dig> of  <dig> placebo dogs remained in the study. overall treatment success at each time period was statistically significantly different between the groups  with more dogs being designated treatment successes in the at- <dig> treatment group compared to the saline placebo group in each time period . the odds of success were almost  <dig> times greater in the at- <dig> group compared to the placebo group in the first 24 h;  <dig>  times greater over the 0–48 h period, and  <dig> times greater over the 0–72 h period.table  <dig> summary results of the success/failure analysis. dogs deemed failures in one time period were carried forward into the next time period, where they were also categorized as failures. the odds of success  are tabulated



adverse events
at- <dig> appeared to be well tolerated. adverse events were reported in  <dig> dogs during the study, three in the at- <dig> group and two in the saline placebo group, all from a single site. all were classified with an “unlikely” or “unknown” relationship to study treatment. one dog in the at- <dig> treatment group had mild bradycardia  detected 4 hours after surgery . another dog in the at- <dig> treatment group vomited on a single occasion, and this resolved with no treatment. a third dog in the at- <dig> group was found to have a small excoriated patch on its nose, considered unlikely to be treatment related, and rather resulting from trying to exit the cage. in the saline placebo group, a flea was found on one dog, and another had an episode of diarrhea with fresh blood, which resolved without treatment.

discussion
the study hypothesis was supported, with the results indicating measurable analgesic effects of at- <dig>  compared to placebo, over a 72-h period following surgical site tissue infiltration in  <dig> dogs undergoing cranial cruciate ligament  surgery. the odds of success  were dramatically greater in the at- <dig> group than the placebo group. it is possible that some dogs may have been inappropriately designated as comfortable when in fact pain was present, potentially due to the carry-over effects of the acepromazine sedation in the early postoperative period, or due to a lack of sensitivity of the pain assessment tool. however, in these respects, both groups should have been equally affected, making the comparison valid.

pain is difficult to measure, and although the assessment tool used in the present study has been widely used, it has never undergone criterion validation. however, one measure of the success in measuring pain in placebo-controlled studies is the rescue rate in the placebo group. in the current study, it was 77 % within 24 h, and 91 % over the 72 h of the study, suggesting inadequate pain relief was being detected, and giving one further confidence that at- <dig> provided clinically measurable pain relief. if one assumes surgery is associated with pain, then the lack of rescue of 2/ <dig> dogs in the placebo group would be considered a failure of the assessment system. however, the approach to assessment and rescue in our study appears to have been comparatively successful when looked at other published studies. in a study of dogs undergoing cruciate surgery  <cit> , only 11 %  was rescued in the 24 h following surgery. in a study of dogs undergoing soft tissue surgery  <cit> , only  <dig> of  <dig> dogs were rescued over a 72-h period postoperatively. the lack of intra-operative analgesia provision  was very deliberate due to how difficult pain is to measure. given how insensitive our current assessment tools are, the more background treatments that are administered, the more difficult it becomes to assess whether a novel analgesic provides any benefit. future work, hopefully with more sensitive, and ideally objective, outcome assessments, could evaluate the effect size of this product versus other treatments.

there are few data as to how long post-surgical pain persists in animals, and this time period will vary with the type of surgical procedure performed. the recommended time period for administration of analgesics post-operatively varies from days to weeks, depending on the surgery performed, but expert opinion emphasizes the first 72 h following surgery as a critical time period when analgesics should be administered  <cit> . post-surgical pain can generally be well controlled while an animal is hospitalized using injectable opioids, ketamine, cyclooxygenase inhibiting nsaids and local anesthetics. however, with most veterinary patients being discharged from the veterinary hospital the same day, or within 24 h following surgery, there is a need to bridge between analgesics provided in the hospital and effective pain relief in the home environment. currently in the united states, only oral cyclooxygenase inhibiting nsaids and transdermal fentanyl liquid <dig> have been approved for post-surgical analgesia in dogs. beyond these options, there are unapproved fentanyl patches manufactured for human use, which have been suggested to be efficacious  <cit>  and tramadol is widely used, despite little evidence of efficacy .

overall, there is a clear unmet need for effective analgesic products that can be administered in the clinic, and provide pain relief for the crucial first few days following surgery in the home environment. this pilot study suggests that bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension may directly address this unmet need, providing up to 72 h of analgesia. though statistically greater than placebo, not all of the at- <dig> dogs were successes out to 72 h. in this study, surgeons were not instructed to infiltrate around the anchor points of the suture material. in future studies, infiltration into all the tissue layers as well as around the anchor points for suture or around implants will be performed. bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension will need to be administered as part of a multimodal approach as the anesthetic wears off, and indeed, this is consistent with the current recommendations for the treatment of postoperative pain  <cit> . the prolonged duration of continuous action may also prevent episodes of breakthrough pain.

the current study was a pilot study, performed in dogs undergoing a single type of surgery, lateral retinacular suture placement for cruciate insufficiency. as such, the generalizability of these results to the larger population of dogs undergoing a variety of orthopedic surgeries and other surgical procedures is unknown. however, given the demonstrated efficacy in human clinical studies in both orthopedic  <cit>  and soft tissue  <cit>  surgery, it is highly likely that at- <dig> will prove efficacious in dogs undergoing a wide variety of surgical procedures.

the current study employed direct injection of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension into the surgical wound, and this may raise concerns about wound healing and wound infection. while there is some evidence that local anesthetics alter the cellular events of early tissue healing, there does not appear to be a clinically significant impact on wound healing or mechanical wound strength in preclinical animal studies  <cit>  or humans. infection rates following continuous local anesthetic installation into wounds found that reported wound infection rates were similar between active  and control groups  in humans undergoing surgery  <cit> . in the present study, no wound related adverse effects were seen, which mirrors the extensive pre-clinical work in dogs that has been performed with this product. in a dog model of inguinal hernia repair, bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension was infiltrated into the surgical site at doses ranging from  <dig> to 25 mg/kg and a mild granulomatous inflammatory response was seen histologically, that had not resolved by 2 weeks following infiltration, but was not considered indicative of any adverse effect on wound healing and the wound healing findings were similar to control  treated animals  <cit> . in the present study, one dog was found to have bradycardia 4 h following administration of at- <dig>  in previous work, repeated doses of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension were administered to dogs and the dogs evaluated for cardiotoxicity  <cit> . doses of  <dig>   <dig> and 30 mg/kg bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, 9 mg/kg bupivacaine hcl, or a volume-equivalent dose of saline, were administered into the subcutaneous tissue over the scapulae twice weekly for 4 weeks. no clinical signs consistent with central nervous system toxicity were seen and no electrocardiogram abnormalities were detected  <cit> .

dilution in this study was allowed based on the human experience and volumes used in previous canine knee surgery studies. dilution does not impact efficacy in humans  <cit> , and that appeared to be the case in this study as well. most surgeons administered the drug in the undiluted state. the one surgeon who did dilute did so such that the total volume was divisible by four, facilitating a  <dig>   <dig> and 25 % tissue infiltration distribution.

CONCLUSIONS
further work is indicated to develop this product for clinical use. this product has significant potential to address an important clinical need - the provision of extended duration local wound analgesia.
