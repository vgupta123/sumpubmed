BACKGROUND
the microsurgical reconstruction of an interrupted nerve is based on end-to-end neurorrhaphy of the stumps without tension. to overcome more extensive defects of peripheral nerves, autologous grafts prepared from cutaneous nerves are often used  <cit> . however, it is difficult to repair a nerve if the proximal stump is not available or the autogenous nerve grafts are insufficient for reconstruction of extensive nerve damage. especially difficult is the treatment of proximal compartments of the brachial plexus where surgical outcomes and functional restoration of the affected arm are still very limited  <cit> . the situations lead to a search for alternative methods that can overcome these shortcomings.

recently, new approaches to the reinnervation of damaged nerve have been tested in animal experiments and in clinical practice based on end-to-side neurorrhaphy. in this method of neurotization, the distal nerve stump was sutured to epineurial or perineurial window of appropriate intact nerve. this type of neurorrhaphy is based on the potential formation of collateral sproutings from axons of intact peripheral nerves  <cit> . collateral sprouts are created from ranvier´s nodes of intact axons at the place of application of end-to-side  neurorrhaphy. the axon collaterals grow into the denervated nerve stump and take part in a functional reinnervation of peripheral structures denervated following injury to the corresponding nerve; the process is called lateral neurotization .

it is assumed that factors released by the cells of damaged nerves stimulate intact axons to send collateral sprouts. activated schwann cells, which up-regulate many axon promoting factors, play an important part in the stimulation of collateral sprouting  <cit> . for example, cntf, insulin-like growth factors i and ii  released by activated schwann cells of denervated stumps have been shown to enhance collateral sprouting from donor nerves  <cit> .

vascular endothelial growth factor  is a potent angiogenic factor that stimulates proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, formation of new blood vessels and enhances vascular permeability  <cit> . some experiments have demonstrated that increased levels of vegf in a damaged nerve, by direct or plasmid delivery, support and enhance the growth of regenerating nerve fibers, probably by stimulation of schwann cells  <cit>  or by a combination of angiogenic, neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects  <cit> .

therefore, in the present study we investigated reinnervation of mcn stumps transfected by plasmid phvegf and reconnected by ete neurorrhaphy with proximal stumps or by ets neurorrhaphy with the un. here, we report that phvegf transfection increases expression of vegf in schwann cells of the mcn stumps and promotes axon reinnervation in both ete and ets neurorrhaphy models.

RESULTS
immunohistochemical detection of vegf in the intact nerve and following injection of plasmid phvegf
transverse cryostat sections through samples of intact mcn and distal mcn stumps two months after plasmid transfection revealed vegf immunostaining in the blood vessels and schwann cells. intensity of vegf immunofluorescence was very similar in the blood vessels, but higher in schwann cells of transfected mcn stumps compared with intact mcn . double immunostaining for vegf and neurofilaments verified increased vegf staining of schwann cells surrounding axons in distal stump of mcn transfected with plasmid phvegf. in addition, simultaneous immunostaining for vegf and reca- <dig> displayed vegf level in blood vessels of transfected mcn stumps . the results indicate that plasmid phvegf was incorporated and increased production of vegf protein in schwann cells.

behavioral test and wet weight muscle index
the rats after ete as well as ets neurorrhaphy and plasmid phvegf transfection displayed a significantly higher behavioral test score in comparison with animals treated with plasmid or vehiculum. the results of behavioral tests were significantly better in the ete than ets neurorrhaphy rats and the rats transfected by plasmid phvegf . a correlation of behavioral tests with morphometric features of regenerated axons is provided below. the biceps brachii muscle weight index reached significantly higher values in vegf-treated animals following ete as well as ets neurorrhaphy compared with control animals treated with plasmid or vehiculum only. however, the wet weight muscle index was significantly higher in the rats with mcn stumps transfected with plasmid phvegf and reconnected using ete as opposed to ets neurorrhaphy .

quantitative analysis of retrogradely labeled dorsal root ganglia and spinal motor neurons
ete neurorrhaphy
the pool of spinal motor and primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia  contributing to the innervation of the mcn from intact rats was 320 ±  <dig> and 1490 ±  <dig>  respectively. both neuronal pools are comparable with values obtained in our previous experiments  <cit> .

the number of labeled motor and primary sensory neurons as well as their connections to the total number of labeled neurons was moderately higher in rats with mcn stumps transfected with plasmid phvegf than in control animals with transfection of mcn stumps by plasmid or after treatment with vehiculum. however, this higher number of labeled neurons after plasmid phvegf transfection was not statistically significant when compared with control animals .

number of labeled motor and sensory neurons and their relations to the total number of labeled neurons in intact mcn and the mcn stumps after their transfection by plasmid phvegf, plasmid alone or vehiculum treatment and ete neurorrhaphy . no statistically significant differences were found among experimental groups.

ets neurorrhaphy
the axons of the un contributed to reinnervation of mcn stumps after ets neurorrhaphy with the un. the un neurons were labeled by distinct red, green and yellow  fluorescence in longitudinal sections through both the spinal cord segments  and the drg at the same levels when the fr and fe were applied into the un and mcn stump, respectively . the numbers of drg and spinal motor neurons labeled with red, green or yellow fluorescence were assessed and are summarized in table  <dig>

the results of number of labeled motor and sensory  neurons the axons of which are present in the un of rats after ets neurorrhaphy of the mcn stumps transfected by plasmid phvegf, plasmid only or treated with vehiculum . the motor and drg neurons labeled with red fluorescence  are associated with motor and sensory axons present in the donor un without contribution to reinnervation of the mcn stump. green fluorescence  indicated neurons whose axons were damaged during surgical treatment and regenerated only into the mcn distal stump. a yellow color  is the labeling of neurons that resulted from a mixture of red and green fluorescence and indicated those neurons, the donor axons of which were present in the un and had sent out collateral sprouts into the distal stump of mcn. therefore, g + y labeled neurons indicated the number of neurons contributing to reinnervation of the mcn stump after ets neurorrhaphy. the relation among g, y and g + y labeled neurons to total number of labeled neurons was calculated.

red fluorescence indicated the largest number of motor and drg neurons with axons present only in the un distal to ets neurorrhaphy. the numbers of red fluorescence labeled motor and sensory neurons were comparable amongst individual experimental groups without statistical significant differences.

green fluorescence labeled un neurons whose axons were damaged during ets neurorrhaphy and regenerated only into the mcn distal stump. similar numbers and proportions of green-labeled motor and drg neurons were found in control plasmid transfected and vehiculum-treated rats while phvegf transfection induced increased numbers and proportions of green-labeled motor and drg neurons. however, this elevation in phvegf transfected rats was statistically significant only in motor neurons.

yellow fluorescence labeled neurons resulted from a mixture of red and green fluorescence indicating those neurons, the donor axons of which were present in the un, had sent out collateral sprouts into the distal stump of the mcn. the yellow-labeled neurons were found in both the spinal ventral horn and the drg  of the operated rats. the number and proportion of yellow-labeled to total labeled motor and drg neurons was significantly higher in phvegf transfected compared to control rats . the neurons with axons reinnervating into the mcn stump were labeled by green and yellow  fluorescence. the summary of green and yellow labeled drg and motor neurons and their proportion was significantly higher in rats following phvegf transfection of mcn stumps compared with control rats .

ete neurorrhaphy
surprisingly, the number of myelinated axons per  <dig>  μm² was higher in the mcn stumps of rats transfected by plasmid phvegf or plasmid only  than in the mcn removed from intact rats. however, the mean axon diameter and myelin sheath thickness were always significantly lower in all ete treated animals compared with morphometric values of myelinated axons of the intact mcn. the mcn stumps transfected by plasmid phvegf displayed a larger axon diameters and myelin sheath thickness than in the mcn stumps transfected by only plasmid or treated with vehiculum .

mean density and diameter of myelinated axons as well as thickness of the myelin sheaths in the mcn of intact rats and those with end-to-end  or end-to-side  neurorrhaphy after application of plasmid phvegf, plasmid  and vehiculum. six rats were used for each group.

ets neurorrhaphy
when compared with the intact mcn, mcn stumps distal to ets neurorrhaphy contained significantly higher density of myelinated axons per  <dig>  μm² following transfection by plasmid only. the density of myelinated axons was comparable to the intact mcn when the mcn stumps were transfected with plasmid phvegf but lower and without statistical significance after vehiculum treatment. this was because of large individual differences expressed in the sd high value.

the mean diameter of myelinated axons was significantly higher in the mcn stumps transfected with plasmid phvegf than plasmid only or after treatment of vehiculum, but in all cases these values were significantly lower than in the intact mcn. the mean myelin sheath thickness was similar in the mcn stumps after all types of treatments and ets neurorrhaphy, and always lower than in the intact mcn .

distribution of myelinated axon diameters
distribution analyses of myelinated axon diameters revealed that phvegf transfection of mcn stumps induced a decreased percentage of axons in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm after both ete and ets neurorrhaphy compared with mcn stumps transfected by plasmid alone. increased percentage of myelinated axons was found in mcn stumps transfected by phvegf plasmid in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm after ete and ets neurorrhaphy, respectively .

discussion
recent standard methods to reconnect the stumps of interrupted peripheral nerves are based on either ete neurorrhaphy without tension or ete with nerve graft insertion  <cit> . however, ete neurorrhaphy is impossible if the proximal stump is not available, after avulsion of the nerve roots from the spinal cord or when graft nerve material is lacking after an extensive loss injury  <cit> . therefore, clinical situations have led to a search for alternative methods including ets neurorrhaphy based on the growth of collateral axonal sprouts. several lines of evidence have shown that intact axon shafts send off collateral sprouts after ets neurorrhaphy  <cit> . we have observed the formation of collateral sprouts sent off by intact sensory and motor axons of the un into mcn stumps after ets neurorrhaphy. in addition, retrograde labeling of the neurons using dextran conjugated with two different fluorophores  has also proven to be a suitable method for quantitative morphological evaluation of collateral sprouting  <cit> .

it is generally accepted that creation of collateral sprouts from ranvier’s nodes of intact axons is stimulated mainly by reactive schwann cells of the distal stumps of severed nerve. these reactive schwann cells produce axon promoting molecular factors  <cit> , some of them, such as cntf, basic fibroblast growth factor- <dig>  and insulin-like growth factors i and ii, are also cable of enhancing collateral sprouting  <cit> . therefore, applications of axonal sprout promoting molecules together with meticulous surgical technique are believed to be key factors needed to improve results for axonal collateral sprouting after end-to-side neurorrhaphy.

it is well known that blood vessels and nerves share many similar molecular pathways during development and regeneration including creation of sprouts stimulated by vegf  <cit> . it has been demonstrated in various models of nerve injury that vegf promotes axonal outgrowth and proliferation of schwann cells to enhance nerve reinnervation  <cit> . in our experimental models of ete and ets neurorrhaphy, we found that plasmid phvegf transfection of the mcn stumps resulted in an elevation of vegf protein in schwann cells. moreover, we demonstrated that an injection of plasmid phvegf directly into the distal stump of the severed nerve may successfully improve its reinnervation. this easy transfection method is important issue relative to possible clinical applications.

transfection by plasmid phvegf increased the numbers of motor and drg neurons, the axons of which reinnervated the distal mcn stumps after both ete and ets neurorrhaphy. however, an enhancement of neurons after ete neurorrhaphy was not statistically significant compared with control animals . this is probably because regrowth of axons after this type of reconnection is sufficiently stimulated by intrinsic cellular and molecular stimuli of the distal nerve stumps, and vegf efficacy is not higher. in addition, no significant changes were observed in the proportion of motor and drg neurons amongst experimental groups of animals operated on using ete neurorrhaphy. this suggests that phvegf transfection had no supporting effect for motor or sensory axon regrowth after this type of nerve reconnection.

in contrast to ete neurorrhaphy, the reinnervation of the distal mcn stumps after ets neurorrhaphy is limited to stimulation of collateral sprouting, mainly by schwann cells  <cit> . schwann cells enhanced expression of vegf protein after plasmid phvegf transfection and induced elevation of motor and drg neurons that reinnervated the distal mcn stumps after ets neurorrhaphy. it is important to note that no significant differences were obtained when we compared the proportion of motor and drg neurons, the axons of which were present in the mcn stump . this result indicates that vegf induced similar conditions for direct regrowth of motor and sensory axons and for formation of collateral sprouts from motor and sensory axons in the donor nerve without specific preference. no motor or sensory neuron preferences were found in the mcn stumps of control animals what is in agreement of our previously published results illustrating similar capacity of the motor and sensory axons to create collateral sprouts  <cit> . moreover, plasmid phvegf transfection significantly increased the number of motor and drg neurons , the axons of which were regenerated directly into the mcn stumps. this suggests that vegf may protect against the death of neurons that have lost their axon connections, as has been observed in other papers  <cit> .

although phvegf transfection did not affect the numbers of neurons that reinnervated the mcn stumps after ete neurorrhaphy, the increased expression of vegf protein in schwann cells significantly improved the morphometric quality of regenerated axons and values of behavioral test and wet weight muscle index. the axon promoting effect of vegf transfection was also found in model of ets neurorrhaphy, but improvement of axon diameter and myelin sheath thickness were significantly lower than in mcn stumps after ete neurorrhaphy. however, the axon promoting effects of phvegf transfection of mcn stumps in both neurorrhaphy models correlates with published results  <cit> . both the increased number of neurons whose axons reinnervated, directly or by collateral sprouts, the mcn stumps after ets neurorrhaphy and a higher quality of morphometric parameters of myelinated axons improved functional reinnervation of the biceps brachii muscles, illustrated by behavioral  test and wet weight index. values that showed less improvement on the behavioral test and wet weight index were expected after ets than ete neurorrhaphy.

surprisingly, the improvement of axon diameter and myelin sheath thickness was also found in the mcn stumps transfected only by plasmid alone when compared with vehiculum treated nerve stumps. probably, a positive effect of plasmid transfection alone could be caused by stimulation of schwann cell proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our experimental results confirm that increased vegf protein in nerve stumps, after plasmid phvegf transfection, resulted in a higher quality of axon regeneration and functional reinnervation after both ete and ets neurorrhaphy.
