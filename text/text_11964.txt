BACKGROUND
mangroves are the tidal forest existing in the intertidal zone of sheltered shores, estuarine tidal creek, lagoon, and marshes mudflats of the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. mangrove ecosystem supports a wide range of living resources and protects the coastal zone. sundarbans, being the largest mangrove delta of the world, is unique for its ecological dynamics and is routinely inundated with low, moderate or high saline water. this ecosystem is ideally situated at the interphase between the terrestrial and marine environment and harbors a rich and diverse group of microorganisms  <cit> . due to its high index of species diversity and limited consumable nutrient sources, an interspecies competition is an obvious phenomenon within the residing microbial population. several secondary metabolites  from plant origin are available which are toxic to microorganisms, need to be degraded or detoxified by certain microbes for their own sustenance. in such an ecosystem, the microbes are under the selection pressure and ultimately evolve to produce novel bioactive secondary metabolites as one of their survival strategies. in the microbial world, actinomycetes are phylogenetically defined as a taxa within the high g + c content subdivision of the gram-positive phylum  <cit> , involved in important processes in a wide range of habitats  <cit>  and holds the prime position in production of bioactive metabolites. they are responsible for the production of almost half of the discovered bioactive secondary metabolites  <cit> , notably antitumor agents  <cit> , immunosuppressive agents  <cit> , enzymes  <cit>  and especially antibiotics  <cit> . till date, more than  <dig>  antibiotics have been isolated from actinomycetes  <cit> . a few decades ago, this identification of such huge numbers of antimicrobial has led to a misconception that the discovery of bioactive metabolites from actinomycetes might reach its extreme limit. but with the advent of next generation sequencing  <cit>  and sophisticated bioinformatics tools, number of whole genome sequences of model actinomycetes  <cit>  became available and analysis of those genome sequences revealed identification of number of rare actinomycetes. further characterization of these new isolates has lead to isolation and identification of novel bioactive compounds with significant therapeutic potential. according to a mathematical modeling, only 3 % of all antibacterial agents synthesized by streptomycetes have been reported so far  <cit> . in concomitant with this information and emerging problem of multi drug resistance  and new phyto-pathogens, actinomycetes regained its position as the center of interest and isolation of actinomycetes from relatively unexplored region is again popularized  <cit> . recent worldwide exploration especially in china and japan proved the notion completely relevant . india with its enormous geographical diversity offers entirely unique environmental dynamics that support prospering of diverse group of microorganisms which also include different kinds of actinomycetes. actinomycetes diversity and their biological activities are also a prospective field of research in the indian context as several new species of this phylum has been reported from this part of the world  <cit>  and significant number of antibiotics patents were registered in recent years  <cit> .

several research groups of china  have isolated diverse mangrove actinomycetes and identified them as promising and productive sources of novel bioactive compounds. new actinobacterial compound from sundarbans has also been reported  <cit>  earlier, which is now compounded with our study. in the present study, actinomycetes were isolated from relatively unexplored regions of sundarbans. an array of selective isolation and characterization procedures were used to recover and identify diverse actinomycetes from soils prior to establishing their activities. representative isolates were found to be active against various test organisms including phytopathogens. they were characterized using conventional, morphological and molecular systematic methods as well as on the basis of their ability to utilize different carbon source and chemical compounds. conditions for the production of metabolite with antimicrobial potential were optimized for the selected strains as to achieve the best yield of secondary metabolite at an accelerating rate  <cit> . finally the crude extract from the most active strain sms-su <dig> was analyzed by gc-ms to estimate the actual bioactive potential and the particular bioactive compound responsible for the antimicrobial activity was purified.

methods
sampling locations for the isolation of actinomycetes
sediment samples were collected from three different sampling stations, selected on the basis of variation in the anthropogenic influences as well as the salinity gradient of the river matla, flowing close to the sampling stations . to avoid recurrence of identical actinomycetes, five sampling points were set in each sampling site within an area of  <dig> meter <dig> and then the soil samples were collected at different depths  and mixed to generate a composite soil for further analysis. soil samples  were collected using clean, dry, sterilized polythene bags along with hand core and sterilized gloves to avoid any kind of contamination so that the points of collection had as widely varying characteristics as possible with regard to the organic matter, moisture content, particle size and color of soil. samples were preserved at 4 °c until pretreatment which was required for inhibiting or eliminating unwanted microorganisms. longitude and latitude of the sample collection points was noted with a gps tracking device . physicochemical parameters of the soil samples were measured according to basak et al.  <cit> .table  <dig> physicochemical parameters and sample site descriptions

pretreatment of the soil and isolation of actinomycetes
the samples were dried in a laminar flow-hood for a certain period. once dried, the samples were sieved to exclude large mineral and organic particles followed by selective pre-treatments of the soil samples including heating at 70 °c for 20 min  <cit> , rehydration, moist incubation and centrifugation  <cit> , treatments with chloramine-t  <cit> ; phenol   <cit> ;  <dig>  % sds and 6 % yeast extract , calcium carbonate and chitin treatment  <cit> .

the pre-treated soil samples were then dissolved in  <dig>  % saline water and serially diluted down to 10– <dig> .100 μl aliquots from solutions were plated on seven selective media supplemented with different concentration of salt up to 18 % . the basal composition of those media as follows,  m <dig> ,  isp <dig> 2so4-2 g; caco3-2 g; feso <dig> h20-1 g; mncl2-1 g; znso4-1 g; agar-20 g ph  <dig>  ±  <dig> ),  isp <dig> ,  gym ,  starch-casein media ,  im <dig>  <cit>   and  cross streak media  . all the above mentioned compositions are for one liter of media. the isolation media were supplemented with filter sterilized nalidixic acid & amphotericin b  to inhibit the growth of gram negative bacteria and fungus. all the plates were incubated at 28 °c for  <dig> to 31 days to target slow growing actinomycetes.

initially dry, powdery, fuzzy, branched filamentous and aerial filamentous colonies were identified as actinomycetes and they were sub-cultured in m <dig> media for further characterization

morphological identification
selected actinobacterial isolates were preliminarily subjected to phase contrast microscopy with zeiss scope-a <dig> microscope to observe the branched aerial hyphae arrangements. spore chain ornamentation and spore surface of the isolates were observed under scanning electron microscope  with thick gold coating in ruorum  <dig> tes for 10 min.

biochemical characterization on the basis of carbon source utilization
the gen iii microplate™ test  was carried out for the selected strains, which provides a standardized micro-method using  <dig> biochemical tests to profile and characterize a broad range of bacteria  <cit> . biolog gen iii microplate analyzes a microorganism depending on phenotypic tests which includes  <dig> carbon source utilization assays and  <dig> chemical sensitivity assays. to represent the relatedness between the nine isolates on the basis of biolog assay, a dendrogram was constructed  <cit> . presence of a positive reaction was assigned the binary value  <dig>  and negative reaction was assigned a binary value of  <dig>  for each of the biochemical characteristics, at least one strain differed in any one characteristic. the dendrogram based on euclidean distances was generated through the hierarchical cluster analysis algorithm using spss for windows version  <dig>  .

along with the biolog test, various classical biochemical tests including starch hydrolysis, catalase, oxidase etc. were also performed using standard protocols  <cit>  for phenotypic fingerprinting and genus level confirmation.

dna amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
representative actinomycetes strains were inoculated into 250 ml conical flask containing 50 ml gym medium and cultured at 28 °c with shaking at 150 rpm for 7 days. genomic dna was extracted with hipura streptomycetes dna isolation and purification kit . concentrations of all the extracted dna samples were adjusted to 30 ng μl− <dig> for pcr reaction. universal primers such as eubac27f and eubac1492r  <cit>  were not successful for all the strains for amplification of 16s rdna. to encounter this problem a new forward primer ab <dig>  was designed at the second conserved region of 16s rrna gene from a multiple sequence alignment of available actinomycetales 16s rdna gene sequences in the genbank and used in combination with universal reverse primer 1378r  <cit>  . the pcr reaction was performed in a final volume of 25 μl, which consisted of template dna 2 μl: molecular grade h2o: 15 μl, buffer:  <dig>  μl including  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  1 μl dntp mix ,1 μl of forward and reverse primer each ,  <dig>  μl  of taq-polymerase and 1 μl dmso under the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °c for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °c for 60 s, annealing at 54 °c for 50 s,72 °c for 120 s and final extension of 72 °c for 10 min. pcr products were purified with qiagenqiaquick pcr cleanup kit. pcr amplified templates were sequenced using abi  <dig> genetic analyzer . sequence data were compiled with the bioedit program  and examined for sequence homology with the archived 16s rdna sequences from genbank at http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide, employing the blast search program  <cit>  and eztaxon server . multiple sequences were aligned with clustal w  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses were performed according to the neighbor joining , maximum parsimony  and maximum likelihood  methods using mega version  <dig>   <cit> . to determine the support for each clade, bootstrap analysis was performed with  <dig> re-samplings. sequences were deposited in genbank  under the accession numbers .

purification of the bioactive compound from sms_su21
the crude extract was subjected for silica gel thin layer chromatography  with a solvent system of methanol: chloroform . the tlc fractions were extracted from the scraped spots and checked for antimicrobial activity against various test organisms including plant pathogens. finally the active principal component of sms_su <dig> was separated by hplc  instrument with a nova-pak hr-c <dig> column . mobile phase was a gradient of water:acetonitrile , flow rate  <dig>  ml min− <dig>  uv detection at 275 nm with waters™ <dig> tuneable absorbance detector. the fraction with bioactive principal was pooled and dissolved in 100 μl methanol to achieve 50 μg ml− <dig> concentrations.

gc-ms analysis of sms_su21
identification of the chemical compounds present in the crude extract was carried out by gc-ms. analysis was conducted on a factor four™ capillary column  with the following conditions: constant flow of helium,  <dig>  ml min−1; the inlet temperature 285 °c remain the fixed throughout the analysis; injection volume, 2 μl  in the liner with an open purge valve  initially and closed at  <dig>  min, and open again  at  <dig>  min and remain open till the end of the run; oven temperature program, 80 °c for 2 min, then 18 °c min− <dig> ramp to 260 °c and held for 6 min, again  <dig> °c min− <dig> ramp to 285 °c and held for 6 min. the ms instrument transfer line temperature was 280 °c, with 220 °c ion trap and 120 °c manifold temperatures. full-scan  ei  mode with <dig> μa filaments current was used for ms analysis from  <dig> – <dig>  min, which gave  <dig>  s/scans . target automatic gain control was  <dig> , and the multiplier voltage was 1450 v. baseline offset − <dig>  peak find with s/n of the quantifier ion at least  <dig> and peak width 2 s was set as the parameters for processing the peaks in the chromatograms. minimum similarity match with regards to the nist library spectra was kept at  <dig> . quantification was done on the basis of diagnostic ion and the peak assignments and integration were automatically done through software.

a total of  <dig> actinomycetes were isolated at different locations in sundarbans, among which  <dig>  from gadkhali,  <dig>  from bonnie camp and  <dig>  from kalash . all the isolates survived through various soils pre-treatment programmes which suggest them to be genetically well-equipped and able to maneuver various survival strategies even in a competitive environment like sundarbans mangrove. all the isolates were subjected to primary screening for antimicrobial activity where six strains  from bonnie camp were found to possess antimicrobial activity and only two strains  from gadkhali and only one strain  from kalashwere active against various test organisms. these nine bioactive strains were further selected for poly-phasic identification.

identification of actinomycetes
morphological, biochemical and chemotaxonomical analysis
seven selective media  were used to observe the distinct colony morphology of the isolates. the colours of the aerial and substrate mycelium were described according to the colours of the ralcode. aerial hyphae arrangements, spore chain ornamentation and spore surface of the isolates were subsequently observed by phase contrast and scanning electron microscopy , indicating variation among the sporophore sizes and ornamentation and even in the spore surface, especially sms_ <dig> possessing a unique bouquet like spore arrangement.fig.  <dig> panel 1- morphology of sporophores of nine actinomycetes studied by scanning electron microscopy . scale bar shown on each photomicrograph. panel 2- arrangement of mycelium studied by phase contrast microscopy. 



classical biochemical test evidenced that all the isolates were positive in starch hydrolysis, casein hydrolysis, and catalase test and negative for oxidase test. results of other biochemical tests have been summarized in .

the dendrogram  of the nine isolates was constructed based on the biolog assay indicating species relatedness . the dendrogram differentiated the strains into two broad groups. strains sms_ <dig>  sms_ <dig>  sms_su <dig>  sms_su <dig> formed the first group while sms_ <dig>  sms_b, sms_ <dig>  sms_ <dig>  sms_su <dig> constituted the second group.fig.  <dig> panel a-dendrogram based on euclidean distances of  <dig> carbon sources and  <dig> chemical utilization characteristics for nine actinomycetes. this dendrogram was constructed by using average linkage . panel b - phylogenetic tree based on 16s rrna gene sequences obtained by the neighbor-joining  method showing the phylogenetic relationships among nine actinobacterial phylotypes of this study  and related actinobacteria. numbers at nodes indicate levels of bootstrap support  based on a nj analysis of  <dig>  resampled datasets, only values greater than 50 % are shown. asterisks indicate branches that were also recovered using the maximum parsimony  and maximum likelihood  algorithms. ncbi accession numbers are given in parentheses. bar  <dig>  nucleotide substitutions per site. the sequence of bacillus subtilis hu <dig>  was used as the out-group



the result of the fatty acid methyl ester  analysis is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the predominant cellular fatty acids of the nine actinomycets isolates were 14: <dig> iso , 15: <dig> iso , 15: <dig> anteiso , 16: <dig> iso ,16: <dig> ,17: <dig> anteiso  and 17: <dig> iso  which closely matched those of streptomycetes but considerable differences were recorded among the nine isolates.

molecular phylogenetic analysis
direct pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene from a single isolate demonstrated excellent congruence between morphology and 16s rrna sequence data. a phylogenetic comparison  of these sequences with the databases of valid species by using ncbi and eztaxon server revealed that eight isolates were representing the genus streptomyces whereas sms_ <dig> showed only  <dig>  % sequence similarity with streptomyces albogriseolus nrrl b-1305t and  <dig>  % sequence similarity with corynebacterium auris dsm 328t. when compared with available type strains only , it was found that among the eight isolated strains sms_su <dig> showed  <dig>  % similarity with streptomyces griseorubens nbrc 12780tand shared a close phylogenetic relationship with sms_b which is  <dig>  % similar to streptomyces variabilis nbrc 12825t. according to eztaxonsms_su <dig> shared only  <dig>  % sequence similarity to the type strains like streptomyces labedae nbrc 15864t, streptomyces variabilis nbrc 12825t and streptomyces erythrogriseus lmg 19406t. sms_ <dig> is  <dig>  % similar to streptomyces atrovirens nrrl b-16357t,sms_su <dig> is close to streptomyces coelicoflavus nbrc 15399t whereas sms_ <dig> is almost 99 % similar to streptomyces lusitanus nbrc 13464t. both sms_ <dig> and sms_ <dig> are vary closed to streptomyces tendae atcc 19812t but they are quite district from each other in respect to other characteristics.

antimicrobial activity
initially all the  <dig> pure isolated actinomycetes strains were subjected to preliminary antimicrobial assay by perpendicular streak method. only nine out of the fifty four isolates showed antimicrobial activity against both bacterial and fungal test organisms. these nine isolates were selected for characterization studies. depending on higher degree and broader range of antimicrobial production , only three strains were selected out of the nine strains for further bioactivity studies. antimicrobial activity was assessed with the crude extracts of sms_su <dig>  sms_su <dig> and sms_ <dig> . noticeable development was recorded when; sms_su <dig> inhibited almost all the bacterial as well as fungal test organisms and even the plant pathogenic fungal strains under study to a greater extent. maximum activity was recorded against vibrio cholerae  and staphylococcus aureus  with a mic value of  <dig>  mg ml− <dig>  on the other hand sms_su <dig> proved to be more effective against gram negative organisms, especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa  with a mic value of  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> than gram positive and fungal test organisms. sms_ <dig> is moderately active against bacterial test organisms  though better activity was recorded against all fungal strains .table  <dig> antibacterial and antifungal activity of crude ethyl acetate extracts of sms_ <dig>  sms_su <dig> and sms_su21

the level of growth inhibition was assessed by the average zone of inhibition diameter recorded . ‘++++’ = zone of inhibition ≥ 25 mm; ‘+++’ = zone of inhibition ≥ 20–24 mm; ‘++’ = zone of inhibition ≥ 10–19 mm; ‘+’ = zone of inhibition ≥ 5–9 mm; and ‘-’ = no zone of inhibition. . mic was defined as the lowest concentration that produced zone of inhibition ≥5 mm in diameter against test organism

condition optimization for growth and bioactive compound production
media optimization is a crucial factor for production of bioactive compounds, as proper nutritional composition only leads to the expression of actual genes and triggers the required metabolic pathways  <cit> . here we found that cross streak media was the most favorable one for growth as well as for the production of bioactive compound for sms_su <dig> and sms_su <dig> whereas sms_ <dig> preferred m <dig> medium for growth and activity . isp <dig> with its inorganic nitrogen sources possibly triggers a stress condition. though this stress is not suitable for biomass production but is very useful for secondary metabolite production for all the tested isolates . exactly contradictory result was observed in case of im <dig> media where glucose was used as sole carbon source. this media supported cell mass production for most of the strains but certain decrease of activity was observed for all the strains.fig.  <dig> condition optimization for the strains: a sms_su <dig>  b sms_su <dig>  c sms_ <dig>  dry weight was correlated with growth and antimicrobial activity was measured against vibrio cholera . 



actinomycetes are known for their slow growth, therefore little noticeable increase in biomass production was observed until 96 hours of incubation was reached for all the isolates. generally actinomycetes produce secondary metabolites after attainment of stationary phase, which was achieved by sms_su <dig> and sms_su <dig> after 192 hours whereas sms_ <dig> took much longer time  to produce bioactive secondary metabolites. efficiency of antimicrobial activity reduced considerably after a certain incubation time. it may be because of the degradation of active compound.

growth and antimicrobial activity were observed in the temperature range 16 °c-34 °c. in this study, all the three bioactive strains achieved their optimum growth and highest bioactivity at 28 °c.

salinity is a key factor to regulate the ecosystems in sundarbans mangrove since a salinity gradient was observed from station to station affecting the microbial community profile  <cit> . we noticed that all the isolates were able to grow and remain bioactive up to a salinity level as high as 12 %. sms_su <dig> and sms_su <dig> showed a gradual decrease in growth and activity from 3 % to 9 % although sms_ <dig> achieved its highest biomass at 6 % salinity which indicated that sms_ <dig> was the most halophilic one among the three isolates. at 12 % salinity, growth and activity was severely affected possibly due to extreme osmotic pressure for all the strains but it never ceased entirely.

purification and potential fractions extraction from sms_su21
hplc of the crude extract of sms_su <dig> produced five potential fractions which were tested for various biological activities. in respect to antimicrobial activity, fraction sms_su21-c which presented a single sharp peak showed desired activity . this active fraction was subjected to antimicrobial activity assay and enhanced activity against various test organisms was achieved .

identification of potential bioactive compounds by gc-ms
identification of the volatile components was carried out using gc-ms analysis. the gc-ms chromatogram of the sms_su <dig> crude extract showed a total of  <dig> peaks . when compared with nist database, the nearest compound hits for those peaks were found, the molecular weight and the bioactivity of the compounds corresponding to the  <dig> peaks are presented in . ncbi pubchem bioassay database , dr. duke’s phytochemical and ethnobotanical databases  revealed that among the  <dig> peaks,  <dig> compounds indicating the presence of bioactive constituents which have been previously reported for their antimicrobial activity  that includes phyto-phathogenic activity  pyrimidine, <dig> -dimethyl-2-phenyl] too. other predicted compounds were reported for their pesticidal, antitumor genic, antioxidant, cardenolidic activities but they were not isolated from actinomycetes earlier.fig.  <dig> gc-ms chromatograph of sms_su <dig> crude extract with four major peak indicating the presence of bioactive compounds 



discussion
sundarbans, the largest delta in the world, located at the mouth ganga brahmaputra-meghna river system with  <dig>  km <dig> of mangrove forest, extends over two countries namely, india  and bangladesh . in both the countries, it has been declared as reserve forest. indian sundarbans lies between  <dig> 30′ to  <dig> 15′ north latitude and  <dig> to  <dig> 9′ east longitude. it consists of  <dig> islands out of which mangroves are present in  <dig> islands under  <dig> forest blocks. the study area of the present work is in the western part of indian sundarbans, which is under the administrative control of south  <dig> parganas forest division and extends in north–south direction. very few studies of isolating actinomycetes with antimicrobial potential has been reported from this part of the world  <cit> , of which actinomycetes with antagonistic potential were collected mainly from lothian island  <cit> . for carrying out this study, soil samples were collected from three locations namely, gadkhali, kalash and bony camp, which were proved to be enriched source of bioactive actinomycetes .fig.  <dig> a schematic diagram of the total work plan of the study 



gadkhali is an easily accessible area, about  <dig> kilometers by road from sonakhali, a popular business point in sundarban. it is one of the major entry points in sundarbans. being located just opposite to gosaba block with well-constructed jetty, it is used as the major navigational point for movement within sundarbans. a number of ferry services to different islands and points, both passenger service and also cargo, are there starting from this junction. as a result, this area is visited by thousands of people and also hundreds of boats on each day. in our study, though most number of actinomycetes  were isolated from gadkhali but only two  among them were able to produce compounds with antimicrobial activity. this might be due to the reason that gadkhali remains under high anthropogenic pressure, i.e., oil leakage, agricultural wastes, and commercial market. in this particular location encountering the mentioned factors would be more important than surviving interspecies competitions for the microorganisms. quite natural, the diversity of species of microbes available and consequently identified here are comparatively less than those of kalash and bonnie camp, which are comparatively undisturbed and pristine in nature. bonnie camp, an isolated island with several small creeks, inhabited by broad range of mangroves such as sundari , gewa , goran  and keora ) was proved to be the most bioactive site as  <dig> out of  <dig>  isolates produced antimicrobial compounds. the probable reason might be the network of creeks, which carries water from all the part of sundarbans and these intermixing increases the microbial diversity encouraging competition within the microbial population for nutrient and other factors. another pertinent reason may be the presence of diversified groups of mangroves in bony camp area, since there are few mangrove species which induces the growth of bioactive actinomycetes  <cit> . in contrary, only six actinomycetes were isolated from kalash which is located near the reserved area, under pristine condition. among six isolates only one isolate came out to be positive for antimicrobial activity . a schematic diagram indicating the screening procedure and characterization in this study is provided in .

the polyphasic identification of the selected strains revealed that proximity or distancing of different strains in phylogenetic profile  is independent of the carbon source utilization profile , biochemical characterization ,chemotaxonomic analysis  or antimicrobial potential of them. these characters of a strain were observed to be regulated by its habitat, i.e., site of origin. for instance isolates like sms_ <dig> and sms_ <dig> are very close phylogenetically  but when they were analyzed according to their morphology and antimicrobial potential, significant variation was observed in their characteristics. difference in natural habitat may be the reason as first one was isolated from bonnie camp and the second one from kalash. this type of anomalous behaviour was also noted in case of sms_su <dig> and sms_b.

carbon source and chemical source utilization assay exposed the metabolic edifice of the selected strains revealing metabolic links among them. the dendogram  constructed from this assay indicated that sms_b and sms_ <dig> in accordance to their relative phylogenetic similarity utilizes similar kind of carbon sources. on the other hand phylogenetically distant strain sms_ <dig> occurred in that same cluster suggesting a scenario of environmental adaptation due to the accessibility of similar nutrient sources. this cluster also included sms_ <dig> and sms_su <dig> which utilized majority of available compounds. other three strains, namely, sms_su <dig>  sms_su <dig>  and sms_ <dig> coincide with a single cluster whereas sms_ <dig> formed an entirely new branch within this cluster because of its pristine natural habitat. detailed carbon and other chemical utilization information has been provided in additional file 1: table s <dig> which indicates, that, most of the strains preferred polysaccharides over monosaccharides and other derivatives of carbon sources such as d-galactose, d-fructose, d-raffinose or n-acetyl-β-d-mannosamine, n-acetyl-d galactosamine, 3-methyl glucose etc. all the amino acids specially l-histidine and l-aspartate were utilized at an accelerated rate. inosine and 1 % sodium lactate were utilized by all the strains. few chemicals that include antibiotics , surfactants , dyes  and inhibitor of mammalian cells proliferation  were also supplied as utilization source. interestingly a few strains such as sms_ <dig>  sms_ <dig> and sms_su <dig> indicated positive result for utilization of those compounds which should be marked for prospective industrial application of those strains.

the polyphasic identification of sms_ <dig> deserves a special mention as in 16srrna gene sequencing, it was noted to be only  <dig>  % similar to the nearest blast hit corynebacterium auris according to eztaxon, having a unique sporophore ornamentation that has never been reported earlier . with its unique carbon source utilization pattern and other characteristics it is assumed to be an entirely new genus though further analysis and characterization of this isolate is necessary.

utilization of different media clearly suggested the effect of catabolic repression  <cit>  as glucose being sole carbon source  caused significant decline in antimicrobial potential of all the selected isolates. on the other hand starch as a carbon source was noted to be very useful for growth and activity of all the isolates. ability to fix nitrogen from inorganic salt confirmed the prototrophic nature of the isolates and in the absence of organic nitrogen source , isolates grew at a slower rate though antimicrobial activity was not affected .

salt tolerance in actinomycetes and their antimicrobial potential was previously reported from india  <cit>  as well as from other part of the world  <cit> . most of them were isolated from hyper saline saltpans, and salt lakes. however, very few reports are available regarding actinomycetes isolated from mangroves  <cit> . in our study, isolated strains from the mangrove estuarine ecosystem were apparently either borderline extreme halophiles  or moderate halophiles . according to this scheme, two isolates sms_su <dig> and sms_su <dig> should be categorized under moderate halophiles as they grew best in  <dig> – <dig>  m salt but sms_ <dig>  isolated from kalash  might be considered as borderline extreme halophile as it can grow up to 15 %  salt concentration .

the antimicrobial potential and antioxidant property of the three strains has been represented respectively in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  after condition optimization each of the strain achieved their appropriate antagonistic potential against the test organisms. furthermore these three strains showed fungicidal activity against phyto-pathogens such as rhizoctonia soloni ag- 1a which is a necrotrophic fungus, causing rice sheath blight, the most devastating and intractable diseases of rice, macrophomina phaseolina r <dig> responsible for charcoal rot on many plant species including zea mays and pinus elliottii and ustilago maydis sg <dig>  a potent pathogen for maize. among the three strains sms_ <dig> showed 99 % 16 s rdna sequence similarity to streptomycetes tendae which produces nikkomycin  <cit> , well-known peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics mainly effective against fungal pathogens and insects. in this study, sms_ <dig> was identified to be the most effective strain against fungal strains including phyto pathogens. in addition to antifungal activity, this strain also showed moderate antibacterial activity and low antioxidant property. in16s rdna sequencing, the strainsms_su <dig> showed  <dig>  % similarity to streptomyces coelicolor which is one of the most potent producers of antibiotics like actinorhodin  <cit> . along with antimicrobial activity this strain also exhibited moderate antioxidant property which was never reported from any strain of streptomyces coelicolor. sms_su <dig> showed highest degree of antimicrobial activity and antioxidant producing potential among the three isolates . this particular strain showed 99 % similarity to streptomycetes griseorubens and streptomycetes esraa in 16 s rdna sequencing, which are known for cellulase  <cit>  activity xylanase  <cit>  activity and enzymatic saccharification  <cit>  but search in the antibiotics database  did not evidence any antibiotic production. gc-ms analysis of sms_su <dig> indicated the presence of at least  <dig> bioactive compounds  which makes this particular strain a very potential one to be more persuasive candidate for further study. among the noted compounds isoquinoline-1-carbonitrile was previously reported for antimicrobial activity  <cit> . derivatives of  <dig> ,4-triazol  pyrimidine, <dig> -dimethyl-2-phenyl and 4-dichloromethyl- <dig> 6-epoxy-2-methoxy-4-methyl-2-cyclohexenone were also reported for antifungal and phyto-pathogenic activity  <cit> . among the other predicted compounds vinylbital, bruceantin, digitoxigenin are already enlisted as important drugs.

one of the major criteria of the study was to isolate an actinobacteria having broad spectrum of antimicrobial property. in this study strain sms_su <dig> fulfilled this criterion most appropriately as it produced zone of inhibition >20 mm for more than half of the test organisms with a relatively low mic value. gc-ms data and antioxidant property also supported that sms_su <dig> was the most active strain.

in the condition optimization study it was evident that cultivation in modified csm media for eight days at  <dig> °c temperature with a shaking speed of 150 rpm is optimum for sms_su <dig> to produce the bioactive compounds.

CONCLUSIONS
nature being a sophisticated, versatile and energetic combinatorial chemist designs unique roadmap with infinite number of different and unpredictable ways, a series of exotic and effective structures, which have ever been made in laboratories. these actinobacteria from marine mangrove origin are priceless natural resources, having immense biosynthetic potential to be effective in biotechnological and industrial point of view. the secondary metabolites may be evolved in nature as some kind of response to the interplay of microbial genetics and natural product chemistry. therefore isolation and purification of economically important secondary metabolites from actinomycetes of sundarban mangrove and characterization of the bioactive compounds is a challenging solution for exploring antimicrobial and cytotoxic compounds from natural sources. thus our study brings forward a good promise for future drug development and agricultural programs.
