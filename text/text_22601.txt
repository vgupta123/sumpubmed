BACKGROUND
insights into the regulation of lignin biosynthesis during vascular development of plants are being derived from angiosperm model plants like arabidopsis thaliana  and from investigations unravelling the molecular basis of wood formation in trees like populus . members of the r2r3-myb transcription factor family have been implicated as regulators of phenylpropanoid and lignin metabolism  <cit>  as well as pattern formation and differentiation of primary and secondary vascular tissues, . the myb proteins comprise one of the largest families of plant transcription factors, which is represented by over one hundred members in the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . the biological roles of mybs have been deduced primarily from flowering plants  including snapdragon  <cit> , maize  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and eucalyptus  <cit> . by contrast, the biological roles of only a few r2r3-mybs has been examined in non-flowering plants  and relatively little is known about of their gene family structure  <cit> . the loblolly pine genes ptmyb <dig> and ptmyb <dig> were shown to be transcriptional activators which have the ability to regulate lignin synthesis enzymes  <cit> . they are expressed in xylem tissues, bind ac elements and activate transcription in transient assays in yeast or plant cells  <cit> . overexpression of pine mybs resulted in ectopic lignification in tobacco  <cit>  and in arabidopsis  <cit>  the reports are strong evidence supporting a role for mybs in the lignifying process in gymnosperm trees. lignins play an important role in trees because they confer rigidity and impermeability to wood by accumulating in thickened secondary vascular tissues  <cit> , therefore its regulation is of interest for understanding the genetic basis of wood properties. however, the number of myb transcription factors that may participate in regulating lignification in gymnosperms, and their potential roles remain an open question.

gymnosperms, especially conifers of the pinaceae familyare ecologically and economically important due to their abundance in forests in many parts of the world  and because of their use in diverse wood products . despite recent large-scale gene discovery initiatives for conifer trees like pine and spruce , only a few regulatory gene families have been characterised systematically in any conifer species. in one such study, it was recently shown that the structure of the knox-i gene family appears to be monophyletic in the pinacea, whereas angiosperms have several distinct clades   <cit> . the r2r3-myb family is very large with over  <dig> members in angiosperms  <cit>  and has been divided into several subgroups  <cit> . one may predict that several mybs are likely to regulate lignin metabolism and other aspects of wood formation in conifer trees; however no data have been available from which to infer the size or the structure of the family in gymnosperms. therefore, a broader survey of myb genes expressed in the vascular and other tissues of gymnosperms seems essential for developing a better understanding of their roles in gymnosperm lignin biosynthesis and wood formation.

myb proteins have two structural regions, an n-terminal dna-binding domain  and a c-terminal modulator region that is responsible for the regulatory activity of the protein. the myb domain is well conserved among plants, yeast and animals  <cit> . its consensus sequence contains around  <dig> amino acid residues with regularly spaced tryptophans giving rise to a helix-turn-helix structure  <cit> . there are usually one to three imperfect repeats of the myb domain. proteins with two repeats  are specific to plants and yeast  <cit>  and are the most abundant type in plants  <cit> . plant r2r3-mybs take part in many biological processes including seed development and germination  <cit> , the stress response  <cit>  and epidermal cell fate in addition to their involvement in phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthesis  <cit>  and vascular organisation  <cit>  .

the genetic selection and breeding activities of a few commercial conifer species are being expanded to include genetic mapping and marker development. candidate gene approaches are being adopted to identify robust genetic markers derived from genes that have a physiological role in the traits that are targeted by breeders  <cit> . our goal is to characterise several members of a gene family proposed to play a role in controlling lignin synthesis and wood properties in conifer trees, in order to support candidate gene approaches for marker discovery. in this report, we characterize  <dig> different r2r3-myb gene sequences from the white spruce, picea glauca,  and five from loblolly pine, pinus taeda l . the full-length coding sequences we obtained enabled us to explore their phylogenetic relationships to other plant myb genes and to search for novel amino acid motifs within this large protein family. we also compared the gene structures, i.e. number, size, position and splice sequences of introns, to gain further insights into their evolution. the steady-state levels of myb and cell wall-related gene mrnas were examined by q-rtpcr in various spruce tissues and organs with an emphasis on wood-forming tissues and compression wood formation. we identify three mybs that are preferentially expressed in secondary xylem and are also upregulated during the formation of compression wood.

RESULTS
isolation and sequence analysis of  <dig> r2r3-myb genes from spruce and pine
we isolated and sequenced  <dig> full-length cdnas encoding r2r3-myb genes from conifer trees:  <dig> from spruce  and five from pine . each of the full length cdna sequences were obtained starting from partial or full length clones identified by est database mining , or starting from the pine sequence and using rt-pcr amplification with conserved primers to amplify a spruce fragment . for partial clones, we used race cloning to identify flanking sequences and, full length pcr amplification to generate a single full length cdna. their predicted amino acid sequences were aligned together with the three available full-length myb sequences from gymnosperms  <cit> . the dna-binding domains of these  <dig> gymnosperm sequences showed a high level of amino acid conservation particularly in the r <dig> helix-turn-helix repeat, consistent with its involvement in dna binding . most of the variations among the spruce pgmyb sequences were located in the turn of each r repeat.

the conifer sequences were consistent with the consensus dbd sequence identified by avila et al.  <cit> , which was largely based on angiosperm sequences. only a few amino acid residues differed from this consensus; these were mainly in pgmyb  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and ptmyb <dig> . we found a motif similar to that involved in the interaction with basic helix-loop-helix  proteins in arabidopsis  in the r <dig> repeat of three spruce mybs  as well as in pmmbf <dig> . ptmyb <dig> had a similar motif but with two differences: an r instead of an l, and a gap before the last r residue. in addition, several conifer mybs, including those with the bhlh motif , encoded an r × 5r × 3rr motif similar to the calmodulin-interaction site previously described in the dbd of arabidopsis myb <dig>  <cit> . the highest level of conservation with the calmodulin-binding motif was observed in pgmyb <dig> and ptmyb <dig>  but most of the conifer myb genes shown in figure  <dig> had a similar motif.

phylogenetic relationships and gene family structure of conifer r2r3-mybs
we used the mega  <dig>  method to construct a phylogenetic tree using full length cdna sequences . the result of our analysis is congruent with the three major groups of r2r3-mybs  defined by romero et al.  <cit>  on the basis of their binding affinities to myb recognition elements. on this phylogenetic tree, the predicted spruce myb proteins sequences fell into several subgroups with bootstrap values ranging from 96–100%, indicating the high grouping robustness. all of the spruce and pine myb sequences fell into group a  or c  and none belonged to the b group. the conifer sequences were assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> subgroups previously defined based upon arabidopsis sequences  <cit> . four of the conifer sequences  clustered with arabidopsis sequences that do not fit into a defined subgroup. several pairs of spruce and pine sequences clustered closely together with short branch-lengths indicative of a high degree of homology . indeed, pair-wise optimal alignments with the clustal w algorithm of the pine and spruce pairs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gave amino acid identities from 95% to 100% for the dbd and of 79%–93% for the complete coding sequence , suggesting that they are putative orthologous pairs. by comparison, ptmyb <dig> was less homologous to its neighbouring spruce sequences pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

we also analysed the number, size and sequences of introns in pcr-amplified genomic dna, as a complement to the phylogenetic analysis based on the coding sequences. in angiosperm r2r3-mybs the introns are located in the myb dbd, therefore we sequenced this specific region in genomic dnas of the  <dig> spruce r2r3-mybs, isolated by pcr amplification with gene specific primer pairs spanning each gene's coding region . most of the gdna sequences were identical to the cdnas, ranging from 100% to  <dig> % in amino acid identities , due to a few variations in the predicted amino acid sequences. the sequences were also verified for the lack of non-sense mutations . as observed in angiosperms, we found spruce myb genes with one , two  or no introns .

similarity was found between the spruce mybs in terms of intron position, phases and, in some cases, between intron sequences, but the number and length intron was quite variable. generally, the second intron  was longer than the first  except in pgmyb <dig> where intron i was five times longer than intron ii. the spruce sequences belonging to group a mybs fell into two subfamilies with distinct gene structures, i.e. with one intron  and one without introns . the group c sequences all had one or two introns, as in arabidopsis  <cit> . the intron i occurred before the gl amino acid pair in repeat  <dig> and the intron ii occurred after the gn amino acid pair in repeat  <dig> , as found in the majority of arabidopsis r2r3-myb genes <cit> . only pgmyb <dig> had a different intron i site, named ib, located before the gks amino acids. moreover, the phase  of insertion was consistent, and the end sequences  were conserved among the sequences we analysed . phylogenetically close sequences, like pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  had similar 5' and 3' splice junctions for both introns . the intron of these three genes also showed strong nucleotide sequence conservation, although the first intron of pgmyb <dig> was much longer due to a 20-nucleotide triplicated sequence .

sequence analysis of conserved regions in the c-terminal of p. glauca mybs
the coding regions of the spruce pgmyb sequences ranged widely in length, encoding between 196– <dig> amino acid residues depending on the length of the c-terminal region . we used the predicted c-terminal coding regions of the spruce myb proteins to search for conserved sequences, reasoning that such motifs might be important for the function or post-translational regulation of myb. we used the meme motif-detection software to analyse the c-terminal region of spruce mybs using a set of protein sequences selected for their high degree of similarity to each of the spruce mybs . our approach incorporated a large diversity of sequences; it identified a total of  <dig> different motifs  in the spruce mybs, including nine new unpublished motifs  and  <dig> that were reported previously  <cit> . the probability scores for each of the motifs identified in this study ranged from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  the lowest previously published score for such motif was  <dig> e- <dig>   <cit> . we detected between zero  and five  motifs per protein in the predicated spruce myb sequences. the large number of conifer sequences enabled us to detect three amino acids regions, i, k and p, that appeared to be specific to gymnosperms . other motifs, such as f and g, were shared between gymnosperm and angiosperm sequences. four of the conserved amino acid sequences  shared the central core residues gidpxth but displayed differences in neighbouring amino acids between the consensus sequences of subgroups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> defined by kranz et al.  <cit> .

expression of p. glauca myb genes in tissues of young and mature trees
we surveyed the abundance of each of the  <dig> pgmyb gene transcripts by q-rtpcr, in mature  and young  green-house-grown trees to determine their tissue distribution during normal development. six different organs and differentiating tissues  were collected from two different mature trees . for tissue comparisons, we calculated the number initial myb rna molecules per ng of total rna. spruce pgmybs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed preferentially in differentiating xylem from stem and root. other mybs were abundant in the needles along with one to two other tissues from the stem or the roots or both, some myb mrnas also appeared to have rather ubiquitous profiles or low abundance transcripts. the rna abundance of lignin biosynthesis enzymes pal, 4cl, ccoaomt and cad were also determined in the same tissue samples. the lignin enzymes rnas all gave very similar profiles, and they were most abundant in differentiating xylem .

we also compared the abundance of the different myb transcripts in the differentiating secondary xylem and in the elongating apical leader of young spruce trees . the cell wall-related genes pal, 4cl, cad, ccoaomt and an arabinogalactan protein  were included in this analysis. for these within tissue comparisons, the data were normalized against the ef1-α transcript levels. again, the spruce myb transcripts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were clearly the most abundant among the mybs detected in the secondary xylem, consistent with the data from the mature trees. in the apical leader, the relative abundance of the myb transcripts was quite different than in the secondary xylem, except that pgmyb <dig> transcripts remained very abundant. some myb genes that were weakly expressed or not detectable in secondary xylem were among the most highly expressed in apical stem .

spruce myb genes are differentially expressed in compression wood
we followed the expression of the  <dig> spruce myb genes and five cell-wall-related genes during the early phases of compression wood formation, in order to explore further the potential involvement of mybs in wood formation and lignin biosynthesis. gymnosperm trees form a type of reaction wood  on the lower side of a bent or leaning stem, or in branches. compression wood is enriched in lignin and contains lignins that are more condensed. therefore compression wood formation requires the modulation of lignin biosynthesis, which we hypothesized to involve such gene sequences as r2r3-mybs. we induced the formation of compression wood in actively growing 3-year-old spruces by maintaining at a 45° angle  . after  <dig> days of growth in this leaning position, characteristic compression wood was well developed on the lower side of the stems . we chose to monitor transcript abundance over a 76-hour period immediately after induction, and found that several transcripts accumulated between  <dig> and  <dig> hours . the transcripts of pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clearly increased in the xylem forming compression wood compared to the opposite wood and compared to the vertical trees . the transcripts of pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rna were slightly increased and the seven others did not fluctuate significantly. by contrast, no significant variation in spruce myb rna abundance was observed in the opposite wood, which is found on the upper side of the stem . transcripts for pal, 4cl, ccoaomt and cad lignin biosynthesis enzymes as well as the agp also increased within the same time-frame as the myb transcripts . in the opposite wood, only ccoaomt rna transcripts decreased. no significant variation in transcript abundance was observed for the spruce myb or lignin genes in the terminal shoots of the same seedlings .

discussion
in this paper, we report the complete coding sequences of  <dig> conifer gene sequences that share the characteristic features of the r2r3-myb gene family. thirteen sequences were from p. glauca  and five from p. taeda l. . we characterised the full-length cdna sequences, as well as the spruce exon-intron structure. we assigned the conifer sequences to several phylogenetic clades of the r2r3-myb family and identified conserved motifs within them based on predicted amino acid sequences. the steady-state mrna levels of spruce mybs were surveyed in several tissues to identify those genes that are preferentially expressed in wood-forming tissues. furthermore, we identified pgmybs whose transcript levels are upregulated, along with those of an agp and enzymes of lignin biosynthesis, during the induction of compression wood in young spruce trees.

sequence conservation and identification of amino acid motifs in spruce r2r3-mybs
our data show that the dbds of conifer mybs are highly conserved, whereas the c-terminal region are highly variable, as shown in prior studies of other plant mybs. the predicted amino acid sequences of some of the spruce myb dbds contain a motif for interaction with bhlh proteins and/or with calmodulin. we identified twenty amino acid motifs in the variable c-terminal region, of which nine were previously unreported. the amino acid motifs in the dbd and in the c-terminal region are useful to better characterise the spruce r2r3-myb sequences belonging to each phylogenetic clade.

the r2r3-mybs are specific to plants and are subdivided into three major groups according to their binding affinities  <cit> . the more than  <dig> arabidopsis sequences were placed into  <dig> subgroups based on their overall amino acid sequences and c-terminal motifs  <cit> . amino acid motifs are conserved among members of several of the  <dig> phylogenetic clades or subgroups  <cit> , including the bhlh-interaction and calmodulin-binding motifs in the dna-binding domain  <cit> , and the repression domain pdlnld/elxig/s in the c-terminus  <cit> . in our study, the spruce group c sequences were dispersed among seven phylogenetics clades, five of which were previously defined as distinct subgroups by kranz et al <cit> . all the spruce members of subgroup  <dig> harboured the bhlh-interaction motif as well as the c-terminal motifs f and g, except for pmmbf <dig>  <cit> , which lacked the motif g  described by kranz et al <cit> . the bhlh-interaction motif identified by zimmermann et al.  <cit>  is required for myb proteins to transactivate some of the phenylpropanoid and anthocyanin genes through protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the g motif in the c-terminus has been linked to transcriptional repression of the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  gene by atmyb <dig>  <cit> . several genes in group c also encoded a conserved gidp sequence located after the end of the dbd, suggesting a conserved molecular function for this motif. the dbds of pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were upregulated during compression wood formation, harboured a motif similar to the calmodulin-interaction site of atmyb <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a potential link with the calcium signalling pathway implicated in the regulation of secondary wall formation  <cit> . no conserved regions were detected in the c-terminal region of pgmyb <dig> and its closest homolog ptmyb <dig>  even though experimental evidences indicate that ptmyb <dig> is a regulator of lignin synthesis enzymes  <cit> , as is the case for the closely related egmyb <dig>  <cit> . the presence of a regulator motif in pgmyb <dig> may have escaped our analysis because the parameters were set to detect motifs ranging from 5– <dig> amino acids in length; motifs of less than five amino acids or scattered in several small modules may thus remain undetected.

spruce mybs were relatively under-represented in group a, where they fell into subgroups  <dig> and  <dig>  in our analysis, spruce group a mybs contained six of the nine newly identified c-terminal consensus amino acid sequences. three of these motifs were specific to conifers assigned to subgroup 22: motifs i, k and p found in pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the motifs might be involved in protein or dna interactions; however, it remains to be seen whether they play a role in protein structure or function.

spruce myb phylogeny and evolution
there are very few reports from which to estimate the number of r2r3-myb genes in gymnosperms or to gain insights into the molecular evolution of this protein family  <cit> . according to the phylogenetic relationship with other myb genes in angiosperms and gymnosperms, the spruce myb sequences described here belong to nine different myb clades distributed between group a and group c described by romero et al.  <cit> . none of the conifer sequences identified in this study and none of the reported gymnosperm r2r3-mybs were assigned to the b group  <cit> . we may hypothesize that group b sequences are present only in angiosperms, however, more gene discovery work is needed to draw conclusions since only four of the  <dig> arabidopsis myb genes belong to this group b  <cit> .

despite recent large-scale gene discovery initiatives for conifers like pine and spruce , only a few regulatory gene families have been characterised in any conifer species. the r2r3-mybs family has evolved and expanded very rapidly through numerous gene duplications in angiosperms  <cit> . given the very distant separation of gymnosperms and angiosperms , we were interested in assessing whether a similar gene family evolution would be present in both taxonomic groups. in other words, is the r2r3-myb gene family structure similar in these two groups? in the knox-i gene family of conifer trees, the structure and number of genes was shown to be very different from than of angiosperms, in a recent study investigating evolution of the family in great detail  <cit> . several of the angiosperm clades are missing in conifers which appear to have undergone several recent gene duplications with relatively low sequence divergence levels. our work provides a clear indication that the conifer myb family structure is not all that divergent from that of the angiosperms, in contrast to the knox-i report, suggesting that the basic family structure predates the gymnosperm – angiosperm split. in maize, several subgroups of r2r3-myb genes have expanded within the past  <dig> million years  <cit> . consistent with this, our analysis of coding sequences and introns in spruce myb genes also suggests more recent gene duplications in, at least in some of the clades. for example, pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have high levels of nucleotide sequence similarity in coding sequence as well as introns i and ii.

further investigation is needed to discover the full complement of conifer myb sequences. by comparison to the angiosperms, we predict that the set of sequences described here represents a fraction of the conifer r2r3-myb family. identification of new sequences would complete the evolutionary picture of this conspicuous family of regulators and help to determine its position in the evolution of plant lineages.

potential involvement of the spruce r2r3-mybs in the lignification of woody tissue
the spruce and pine sequences we analysed represent diverse subgroups of the r2r3-myb family. thus, we hypothesized that they could play diverse roles in metabolism and development. the involvement of specific r2r3-myb gene products in lignin biosynthesis and/or wood formation is suggested by their expression profiles and by their sequence homology with genes from pine  and in other species whose functions have been previously tested. the ac cis-regulatory elements, for example, which are found in many promoters of phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthesis genes, play an important role in gene regulation in lignifying xylem cells, thus linking r2r3-myb genes with lignin biosynthesis. ac elements have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of pal in bean  <cit> , 4cl in parsley  <cit> , ccr and cad in eucalyptus  <cit> .

we compared the abundance of the  <dig> different spruce myb mrnas in selected tissues and organs that develop a secondary vasculature in mature spruce, and in the primary stems and differentiating secondary xylem in young trees. pgmyb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all of which belong to the same phylogenetic clade, were expressed preferentially in the secondary differentiating xylem of both juvenile plants and mature trees. interestingly, all three genes were also expressed preferentially in xylem tissues isolated from large roots. by comparison, 4cl had a very similar transcript profile in prospected tissues. the other myb genes had various patterns of expression including phloem-preferential and ubiquitous patterns.

we also compared the rna levels in differentiating secondary xylem during the induction of compression wood in spruce seedlings. compression wood development in conifers that are leaning or bent is characterised by the formation of thicker cell walls, increased lignin content and the deposition of more condensed lignin polymers, among other features  <cit> . the plasticity of lignin biosynthesis and cell wall architecture observed in compression wood have been linked to the fluctuation in abundance of several gene transcripts and proteins  <cit> . although the transcriptional regulators that orchestrate this plasticity are unknown, they might include myb transcription factors due to their implication in xylem differentiation and in lignin biosynthesis. the three pgmybs  that were preferentially expressed in xylem are likely candidates because they were also upregulated on the compression wood-forming side  of the stem but remained relatively constant on the opposite side. the time-course and relative magnitude of the changes in transcript levels of the pgmybs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were quite similar to those seen for genes encoding lignin biosynthesis enzymes and an agp surveyed in the same samples. three other pgmybs  also showed an increase in transcript abundance in secondary xylem upon induction of compression wood. in the control trees, the mrna for pgmyb <dig> was one of the highest we examined in the apical portion of the stem but it was low in secondary xylem. these observations might imply a role for pgmyb <dig> in processes that are common to primary stem growth and compression wood formation. the mixta gene from antirrhinum majus, which belongs to the same phylogenetic subgroup, is involved in cellular development  <cit>  and may provide clues to the role of pgmyb <dig> in conifers.

the expression profiles of a few of the spruce myb genes are consistent with previous reports describing the putative function of homologous genes. for example, spruce pgmyb <dig> is a close homolog of ptmyb <dig>  <cit> , which induced ectopic lignification when overexpressed in transgenic tobacco. a putative role for pgmyb <dig> in lignification is consistent with our data showing a higher mrna level in compression wood, characterised by increased lignin deposition. the gene pgmyb <dig>  showed strong similarity with atmyb <dig>  which is expressed in xylem tissues of arabidopsis and was shown to play an important role in regulating lignification  <cit> . atmyb <dig> is also expressed in developing seeds, where it regulates the extrusion of seed coat-derived rhamnogalacturonan mucilage  <cit> . the accumulation of pgmyb <dig> transcripts in compression wood is consistent with the ectopic lignification resulting from the constitutive overexpression of atmyb <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . by contrast, atmyb <dig>  the most similar arabidopsis sequence to pgmyb <dig>  is not expressed in the stem but is involved in trichome and tapetum development  <cit> , suggesting a putative role in xylem differentiation other than lignin biosynthesis.

the spruce sequence pgmyb <dig> has a close pine homolog, ptmyb <dig>  that has been linked to lignin biosynthesis  <cit> , however the spruce sequence was not expressed preferentially in secondary xylem  nor was it induced during compression wood formation. it was demonstrated that ptmyb <dig> is able to bind the ac-i and ac-ii elements   <cit> . recently, gomez-maldonaldo et al.  <cit>  showed that pine myb <dig> and myb <dig> bind to glutamine synthetase ac elements and that mybs are linked to several metabolic pathways by shared cis-acting elements. based on these observations, it appears that the myb <dig> genes of pine and spruce may regulate phenylpropanoid metabolism as well as nitrogen assimilation in various plant tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
through a systematic survey of est sequence data followed by full length sequencing, we characterised  <dig> conifer r2r3-myb gene sequences . three r2r3-mybs from spruce, namely myb  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were shown to be expressed preferentially in secondary xylem. we also found that transcript levels of six pgmyb genes , were upregulated in differentiating secondary xylem from young trees during the induction of compression wood along with cell-wall-related genes. our study highlights a small set of spruce myb transcription factors that could be good candidate genes for marker development studies. gain-of-function/loss-of-function studies using transgenic plants are also needed to delineate the roles of these different mybs. such studies are expected to lead to greatly lacking insights into the regulation of wood formation in conifers.
