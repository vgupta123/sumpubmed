BACKGROUND
endophytes  reside in the internal tissues of plant at least once in their life cycle. this symbiosis can be oriented towards commensalism or mutualism between host and microbe. in this association, the plant provides a protective sanctuary and accessibility to nutrients, whereas, in return, the endophyte establishes a mutual relationship with host by imparting positive effects by regulating phytohormones and mineral nutrients  <cit> . the endophytic microorganisms secrete metabolites inside plant’s tissues to improve tolerance against abiotic environmental stresses . various biologically active metabolites are produced by endophytic microorganisms such as alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, peptides, azaphilones, terpenoids, and phenolics . schulz et al.  <cit>  emphasized on the diversity of active chemical constituents  from endophytic microbes in comparison with other soil microflora . currently, there have been many reports of bioactive natural products with significantly higher anticancer, insecticidal, and antimicrobial potentials from fungal endophytes  <cit> .

one of the interesting examples is the production of paclitaxel  from endophyte pestalotiopsis microspora  <cit> . such potential has increased the interest to search more numbers of novel metabolites from fungal endophytes  <cit> . in present work, rhazya stricta was selected on the basis of its indigenous medicinal importance whilst to explore associated endophytic fungus and their ability to produce biologically active chemical constituents. rhazya stricta wildly grows in various countries of middle eastern regions and south asia. it is medicinally important plant and is famous for alkaloids contents  <cit> . approximately,  <dig> different kinds of alkaloids are isolated from rhazya stricta  <cit> . some of the chemical compounds isolated from this plant have been identified to possess strong potential in various pharmacological properties  <cit> .

rhazya stricta, being rich in wide array of chemical constituents, was selected with the aim to assess the symbiotic endophytic fungi and potential metabolites. the endophytic wealth has not been efficiently explored from rhazya stricta. in a recent report we isolated fungal endophyte bipolaris sorokiniana lk <dig> from the leaf parts of r. stricta  <cit> . this strain was characterized for the production of bipolarisenol – a new metabolite which is a derivative of radicinol. the metabolite was found to significantly inhibit the activities of urease and acetyl cholinesterase enzymes  <cit> .

looking at its metabolomics potential and bioactivities, we further continued the exploration of bioactive chemical compounds from this endophytic fungal strain. in this regards, current study was aimed to isolate and characterize biologically active chemical constituents produced from b. sorokiniana lk <dig> through advanced chromatographic and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. the results revealed that a new secondary metabolite, sorokiniol , along with two known cyclic depsipeptides, bzr-cotoxin i  and bzr-cotoxin iv  , have been isolated whilst the chemical structures were elaborated through advanced spectral techniques. to understand any biological role of isolated metabolites, the compounds were assessed for their enzyme inhibition activities.fig.  <dig> structures of the isolated compounds  from fungal endophyte bipolaris sorokiniana lk12

enzyme inhibition assays and anti-lipid peroxidation
the ethyl acetate extract and the three compounds were subjected for antioxidant and enzyme suppression assay. the inhibition potential of isolated compounds was evaluated by modified thio-barbituric acid reactive substances  method  <cit> . the oxidation of liposome  was caused by a mixture  of iron chloride  and potassium chloride  in the presence of the sample/compound . ascorbate  was used to initiate the peroxidation. the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °c for 20 min. mixture of tba  and tca  solution) was then added to the reaction mixture, and kept on 95 °c for half an hour. the appearance of pink color was read on elisa microplate reader  at 535 nm. a control without test sample was used and the experiment was repeated three times. the percent inhibition was measured using formula:  x 100; where at and ao are the absorbance for sample, blank and standard after 30 min incubation.

the etoac extract of the fungus b. sorokiniana lk <dig> was assessed for its antioxidant capacity using anti-lipid peroxidation, abts and superoxide anion radical scavenging activities. the results shown that the extract exhibited strong radical  scavenging potential in comparison to control . the anti-lipid peroxidation activity was moderate as compared to the control.

isolation and structural elucidation of secondary metabolites
looking at the bioactive potentials of the etoac extract of endophyte, it was subjected to chromatographic studies to isolate bioactive secondary metabolites which yielded three compounds . compound  <dig> was obtained in the form of pale yellow gummy solid by repeated chromatography experiments while using methanol/ethyl acetate  in a silica gel column. the molecular formula was established as c26h46o on the basis of ei-ms , along with the information obtained through 13c-nmr spectra of compound  <dig> . the molecular formula c26h46o was further confirmed through high resolution mass spectrum , which showed the molecular ion peak of  <dig> at m/z  <dig>  . the 1h-nmr spectrum of compound  <dig> exhibited two signals for two protons each at δ  <dig>   and  <dig>  . these coupling constants along with the multiplicities of the aromatic protons indicated the para-substitution of benzene ring in compound  <dig>  an upfield doublet for six protons at δ  <dig>   and a multiplet for one proton at δ  <dig>   were indicative of the presence of isopropyl substituent at benzene ring. the second substituent was in the form of a long chain alcohol, which was confirmed by the combined ms and nmr spectral data. the down field multiplet at δ  <dig>   was assigned to the methylene moiety directly attached to hydroxyl group, whereas the signal appeared at δ  <dig>   was assigned to the methylene group adjacent to benzene ring. the other methylene groups in the chain appeared between δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  including a singlet at δ  <dig>  . the length of the chain was further confirmed by the fragments appearing in ei-ms at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  similarly, the presence of isopropyl group and the para-substituted benzene ring was confirmed through fragments at m/z  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

13c-nmr spectra of compound  <dig>  indicated the presence of two signals for two sp <dig> carbons each at δ  <dig> ,  <dig> , two quaternary carbons at δ  <dig>  and  <dig> , an upfield signal for two methyls at δ  <dig> , a methine signal at δ  <dig> , and signals for seventeen methylene, including a downfield signal at δ  <dig> , thus supporting the para-substituted benzene ring with isopropyl group and an alcoholic long chain substituent. these assignments were further confirmed by hmbc interactions  and the structure was finally confirmed as sorokiniol , after the producing organism b. sorokiniana. biosynthetically, compound  <dig> is similar in structure to urushiol class of compounds belonging to the plants of anacardiaceae family in the genus toxicodendron  <cit> . the biosynthesis of urushiols involves the decarboxylation and hydroxylation reactions of anacardic acid which is the product of extension of three malonyl-coa units with palmitoleoyl-coa followed by reduction and aldol cyclization  <cit> .fig.  <dig> key hmbc interactions  and major mass fragmentations  in compound 1



compound  <dig> was isolated from the crude extract through repeated column chromatography in semi-pure form. further purification was done by recycling hplc using 7: <dig> etoac/n-hexane with a flow rate of 4 ml/min after three recycles at an elution time of  <dig>  min. compound  <dig> was isolated in semi-pure form at a range of 65 % to 75 % ethyl acetate/n-hexane system from the crude extract through repeated column chromatography. further purification was done by recycling hplc using 7: <dig> ethyl acetate/n-hexane with a flow rate of 4 ml/min after three recycles at an elution time of  <dig>  min. the structure of compound  <dig> was elucidated by the combined spectroscopic analyses including esi-ms and nmr spectroscopy. the molecular formula of secondary metabolite  <dig> was established as c48h85n7o <dig> by hr-esi-ms on the basis of pseudo-molecular ion peak at m/z  <dig>  + . moreover, the major linear peptide  was produced by the cleavage of ester bond between serine amino acid and 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid. this linear peptide produced a main series of adjacent yn peaks at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> corresponding to the successive losses of 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid, n-methylalanine, 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid, n-methylthreonine, leucine, n-methylisoleucine, n-methylvaline, and n-methylleucine, respectively. similarly, bn ions were detected at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> fig.  <dig> fragmentation pattern of protonated bzr-cotoxin i 



all these results suggested the sequence of amino acids for the linearized peptide ion derived from bzr-cotoxin i and thus confirmed the structure  <dig> for the cyclic depsipeptide. compound  <dig> showed two amide protons and five downfield methyl signals in 1h-nmr spectrum, whereas, nine signals for carbonyl groups were observed in 13c-nmr spectrum. the sequence of peptides in the molecule was further confirmed by the hmbc analysis.

the 13c-nmr of  <dig> showed  <dig> carbon signals which was in correlation with molecular formula, c48h85n7o <dig>  the dept experiment revealed the multiplicities while hmqc experiments suggested the attachments of the assigned protons. specific resonances for peptides were observed in 1h-nmr spectrum of compound  <dig> in the form of broad singlets at δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm, which were assigned to amide nh protons. the peptide α protons appeared in the form of doublet of doublet and in some cases in the form of multiplets between δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm. the upfield signals in the region δ  <dig>  to  <dig>  were assigned to the methyl groups of amino acids whereas the methyl groups connected with amide nitrogen appeared between δ  <dig>  and  <dig> . furthermore, the purified product had nearly identical physical and spectral properties as those of the reported cotoxin-i, which was previously reported to be produced by bipolaris zeicola race  <dig>  <cit> .

compound  <dig> was also isolated in semi-pure form from the crude extract through repeated column chromatography at 80 % to 90 % ethyl acetate/n-hexane system. the final purification was obtained through recycling hplc using 7: <dig> etoac/n-hexane with a flow rate of 4 ml/min after three recycles at an elution time of  <dig>  min. the structure of compound  <dig> was elucidated by combined esi-ms and nmr spectral analysis. pseudo molecular ion peak of the protonated molecule + was observed at m/z  <dig>   which was helpful to determine the molecular formula c47h69n7o <dig> for compound  <dig>  the major linear peptide  was produced by the cleavage of ester bond between isoleucine amino acid and 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid. this linear peptide produced a main series of adjacent yn peaks at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> corresponding to the successive losses of 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoic acid, n-methylleucine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, alanine, and phenylalanine, respectively. similarly, bn ions were detected at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> fig.  <dig> fragmentation pattern of protonated bzr-cotoxin iv 



all these results suggested the sequence of amino acids for the linearized peptide ion derived from bzr-cotoxin iv and thus confirmed the structure  <dig> for the cyclic depsipeptide. the 1h-nmr spectrum of  <dig> showed six amide protons and one downfield methyl singlet. characteristic peptide resonances included broad singlets at δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm, which were assigned to amide nh protons. additional signals in the aromatic region were assigned to the benzene ring of phenylalanine amino acids. the peptide α protons appeared in the form doublet of doublet and in some cases in the form of multiplets between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm.

in correlation with the molecular formula c47h69n7o <dig>  the 13c-nmr spectrum of compound  <dig> contained resonances for  <dig> carbons including eight signals for the carbonyl groups in the downfield region. the dept analysis suggested the multiplicities of carbon resonances while hmqc analysis showed the assignments of attached protons. the sequence of amino acids in the peptide was further confirmed through hmbc experiments. based on the above discussion and the comparison of the physical and spectral data with those reported in literature, compound  <dig> was thus confirmed as cotoxin-iv, which was earlier reported to be produced by bipolaris zeicola race  <dig>  <cit> .

enzyme inhibitive potential of secondary metabolites
the purified compounds 1– <dig> were subjected to bio-assays against acetyl cholinesterase  and urease enzyme inhibition whilst these were also assessed for their anti-lipid peroxidation potential. using a concentration gradient, compound  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited significantly higher ache enzyme inhibition as compared to compound  <dig> . the ec <dig> activity for compound  <dig> was  <dig>  +  <dig>  μg/ml  using linear regression curve fitting with ec <dig> shift in graphpad prism. compound  <dig> showed a dose-dependent response against ache enzyme inhibition. in case of urease enzyme inhibition, only compound  <dig> showed 50 % inhibition at maximum concentration whilst other compounds  did not suppressed the enzyme activity . a similar pattern of low level of anti-lipid peroxidation activity was shown by compound  <dig> . the current results conclude that the three compounds exhibit significant ache enzyme inhibition pattern.fig.  <dig> enzyme acetyl cholinesterase inhibition activities of compound  <dig> –  <dig>  the graphical lines shows standard error of means of three replications

previously, there was no report of enzyme inhibition activity of bioactive metabolites isolated from b. sorokiniana lk <dig>  however, a wide majority of fungal endophytes from various plants have been reported to play a vital role against suppression of enzymatic disorders. antioxidant activities are frequently investigated for endophytes  isolated from medicinal plants   <cit> . liu et al.  <cit>  isolated xylaria sp. from the stem of ancient medicinal plant ginkgo biloba and studied the potential of this species to produce antioxidants, where the organism exhibited a strong radical scavenging activity. similarly, huang et al.  <cit>  investigated the total antioxidant and total phenolic contents of a repository of  <dig> endophytes from  <dig> traditional chinese medicinal plants using improved abts methods. similarly, rodrigues et al.  <cit>  and xiao et al.  <cit>  suggested various endophytic fungi from different host plants can show potent source of essential enzyme inhibition activities such as ache inhibition.

on the other hand, alzheimer’s disease, for which ache inhibition emerged as the major therapeutic target, only approved drug is galantamine  <cit> . we used this to compare our results, which were very encouraging; however, further studies at molecular level would be needed to get more insight of receptors involved in the inhibition of ache  <cit> . the present results also suggest that the endophytic microorganism of biologically active medicinal plants also carries interesting bioactivities which could help in discovering lead drugs.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results showed that fungal endophyte associated with medicinal plants can possess a potent ability to secrete biologically active metabolites. in current case, b. sorokiniana lk <dig> produced a new compound, sorokiniol along with two known cyclic peptides bzr-cotoxin i and bzr-cotoxin iv. the chemical constituents exhibited significantly inhibitory effects towards acetyl cholinestrase while moderate urease and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. further studies at broader enzyme kinetics level could further help in understanding the enzyme inhibitory role of chemical constituents isolated from endophytes.
