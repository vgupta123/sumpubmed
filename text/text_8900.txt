BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is well known as an opportunistic human pathogen characterized by a high intrinsic antibiotic tolerance  <cit> . in humans, p. aeruginosa can cause urinary tract, respiratory tract, and burn wound infections  <cit> . respiratory tract infections caused by p. aeruginosa are dreaded in patients suffering from the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis   <cit> . cf patients exhibit an increased mucus production in the lung  <cit> . bacteria like p. aeruginosa are able to colonize this mucus and cause chronic infections, which cannot be eradicated by antibiotic treatment  <cit> . several hypothesis exist explaining the observed high antibiotic tolerance of p. aeruginosa in the cf-lung, which is caused by special growth conditions. these include growth as biofilm-like microcolonies, which have been shown to increase antibiotic tolerance up to 1000-fold  <cit> . a couple of in vitro model systems have been described to simulate a cf lung infection caused by p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the artificial sputum medium is a complex medium based on components measured in the cf sputum  <cit> . it mimics the cf-lung environment during infection and causes typical p. aeruginosa phenotypes as mucoidy and microcolony formation  <cit> . since eradication of chronic p. aeruginosa infections by antibiotics fails, phage therapy is a possibility to treat bacterial infections. advantages over antibiotics are the specificity of phages and that phages can be isolated and investigated rapidly  <cit> . for this reason, several suitable p. aeruginosa broad host range phages have been characterized. the pseudomonas infecting pb1-like phages are widespread in nature and possess highly conserved genomes. comparative genome analysis of five pb1-like  phages was recently published and is the first genome report for these phages  <cit> . pb1-like phages belong to the myoviridae phage family and the genome sizes vary between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp. the genomes encode for  <dig>  to  <dig> proteins   <cit> . more than  <dig> phages have been reported to be pb1-like. these results are mainly based on dna hybridization and morphological studies  <cit> . more recently, pb1-like phages as phage 14- <dig> have been reported as part of a well defined phage cocktail to treat p. aeruginosa burn wound infections  <cit> . the application of phages as a therapeutical agent requires an in depth understanding of the phage biology  <cit> . moreover, phages which multiply well under in vitro conditions can fail to replicate during treatment in vivo  <cit> . therefore, phages and especially the ability of the phage to infect the host in vivo should be investigated carefully prior to use. here we describe the in depth characterization of a broad host range pb1-like phage with a slight prevalence to clinical isolates. we used an artificial sputum medium to simulate the conditions in the cf lung and investigated the ability of phage jg <dig> to infect p. aeruginosa and multiply under these conditions.

RESULTS
isolation and host range of phage jg024
phages were isolated from sewage as described in methods. we isolated  <dig> p. aeruginosa specific phages and used an initial set of  <dig> different p. aeruginosa strains as the laboratory strains pao <dig>  pa <dig> as well as three clinical isolates  to test the host range. one phage, which was named jg <dig>  was able to conduct clear lysis on this set of bacterial strains. to determine the host range of jg <dig> in more detail, we used  <dig> clinical isolates from cf patients and from urinary tract infections as well as a collection of  <dig> environmental strains . jg <dig> is able to infect 84% of all tested clinical isolates. furthermore, jg <dig> is even capable of infecting a p. aeruginosa muca mutant and the clinical isolate bt <dig>  which both showed the same mucoid phenotype. muca mutants produce large amounts of the exopolysaccharide alginate and mutations in muca are critical for the conversion of non-mucoid to mucoid p. aeruginosa variants in the lung of cf patients  <cit> . additionally, we determined the host range of the phage jg <dig> with a collection of  <dig> p. aeruginosa environmental strains isolated from different rivers  in lower saxony, germany. the results showed that jg <dig> was able to infect 50% of the strains. interestingly, phage jg <dig> showed a clear lysis for only 45% of the  <dig> lysed environmental isolates but was able to conduct clear lysis on 68% of the  <dig> lysed clinical isolates.

family affiliation of jg024
to determine family affiliation of phage jg <dig>  we determined the nature of the nucleic acids and the morphology of the phage to assign the family by comparison  <cit> . nucleic acids were isolated as described in methods and identified as dsdna due to its sensitivity to restriction endonucleases like sacii, which cut only dsdna. sacii produced distinct fragments of approximately  <dig> kb,  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb . computational analysis of the sacii restriction sites in the sequenced genome  revealed slightly different fragment sizes of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively as well as two fragments with a size of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, which we observed as one  <dig> kb fragment.

electron microscopy  shows an icosahedral head with a length of  <dig> nm and a width of  <dig> nm. the contractile tail, which consists of a neck, a contractile sheath and a central tube has a length of approximately  <dig> nm. due to these morphological results and in accordance with the presence of dsdna, the phage jg <dig> is grouped to the family myoviridae. this family is a member of the order caudovirales which contains exclusively tailed phages also from the families siphoviridae and podoviridae.

receptor of phage jg024
we used different p. aeruginosa mutants to identify the receptor of phage jg <dig> as outlined by others  <cit> . aflagella mutant , a pili mutant  and an lps mutant  were infected with the phage jg <dig>  after incubation, lysis was investigated on bacterial lawns . jg <dig> lyses the pili- and the flagella mutant but not the p. aeruginosa Δalgc mutant. the algc gene encodes an enzyme with phosphoglucomutase and phosphomannomutase activity. a p. aeruginosa Δalgc mutant produces a truncated lps core and lacks common antigen suggesting that these structures might constitute the host receptor for jg <dig> attachment  <cit> .

growth characteristics
to investigate growth parameters like the latent phase and the burst size of the phage jg <dig>  we performed single step growth curves as described in methods, figure  <dig>  phage jg <dig> has an estimated latent phase of  <dig> min. the burst size, which describes the mean number of phages liberated per bacterial cell was determined as  <dig> phages per infected cell.

jg <dig> is a pb1-like phage
phage jg <dig> dna was sequenced and assembled at mcgill university as described in methods. the genome size of phage jg <dig> is  <dig>  bp and has a gc content of  <dig> %. genome comparison using the blastx tool revealed that phage jg <dig> is highly related to the widespread and conserved pb1-like viruses  <cit> . it was recently reported that these phages show a high sequence similarity and limited horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . the general characteristics as well as the similarity to phage jg <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  the overall nucleotide similarity to pb1-like phages varies between 86% to phage pb <dig> and 95% to the phages sn and 14- <dig> . we also compared the jg <dig> genome sequence with pb <dig> and sn using mauve  <cit>  and detected only few insertions or deletions, additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  due to the high sequence similarity, the broad host range characteristic as well as the morphology, we conclude that phage jg <dig> belongs to the pb1-like phages. in accordance with our findings, pb1-like phages also have been shown to use lps as receptor  <cit> . since the sampling location of jg <dig> in lower saxony, germany is different to all other pb1-like phages, it underscores the broad environmental distribution of this phage group probably due to the broad host range  <cit> .

features of the jg <dig> genome
the schematic representation of the genome, with its assumed orfs, some functional assignments and overall genetic organization is depicted in figure  <dig>  the genome of jg <dig> is compact organized with only  <dig> % intergenic space. no genes encoding for trnas were found in the genome of jg <dig> using the program rnascan-se  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, the gc content of phage jg <dig> differs from its host . comparison of the codon usage of jg <dig> with its host p. aeruginosa showed that the phage shares the same dominant codons for each amino acid except for valin, serin and glutamate. to test if the genome of phage jg <dig> is linear or circular, we used a method described previously  <cit> . a linear genome of phage jg <dig> was identified by treatment with exonuclease bal <dig> which degrades only double-stranded linear dna from both ends simultaneously . however, we did not identify the exact genome ends. this would indicate that the genome of phage jg <dig> is circular permuted in contradiction to the pb <dig> phages, which have been reported to have non-permuted linear genomes  <cit> . since the terminase protein of jg <dig> is highly  identical to that of the pb <dig> phages, we assume phage jg <dig> to have a non-permuted linear genome.

since these phages share a high sequence similarity a comparative orf prediction was possible. first, the heuristic approach of genemark was used to identify genes in small genomes under  <dig> kb  <cit> . with this approach a total of  <dig> putative orfs were identified. in a second approach we used the ncbi orf finder program coupled with the program blastp and compared the translated proteins with the proteins of the pb1-like phages  <cit> . combination of the results of both approaches revealed a total of  <dig> predicted orfs as well as one unique orf in phage jg <dig> 

no rna polymerase was detected suggesting that this phage uses the host transcriptional machinery, as it was also suggested for the pb1-like family of phages.

we detected a putative structural gene cluster which contains genes encoding for putative head structure proteins  as well as for tail and baseplate proteins . moreover, orf  <dig> was designated as a lytic tail protein. it was shown for the phages 14- <dig> and lbl <dig> that this protein has a transglycosylase domain with a n-acetyl-d-glucosamine binding site, which shows a specific degradation of peptidoglycan  <cit> . orf  <dig> encodes a putative endolysin with a high similarity to the endolysin of phage lma <dig>  and belongs to a lysozyme-like superfamily. a putative holin may be encoded by orf  <dig>  which shares a 100% identity to orf  <dig> of phage f <dig> and to orf  <dig> of phage 14- <dig>  it was suggested that these orfs encode probable holins since they are located near the endolysin gene and they encode a small protein  containing three transmembrane domains  <cit> .

additionally, a complete dna replication machinery was detected suggesting that the dna replication is host independent as described for the pb1-like phages. the respective gene cluster contains a dna ligase , a helicase , a dna polymerase iii , as well as a thymidylate synthase . a putative primase was also found but is not included in this gene cluster , as shown for the other pb1-like phages  <cit> . also, differences between the pb1-like phages and jg <dig> were found. phage 14- <dig>  and phage lbl <dig>  encode a hypothetical protein with a size of  <dig> aa. interestingly, this protein is encoded by two orfs in phage jg <dig> designated orf  <dig>  and  <dig> . the two orfs are separated by only  <dig> bp. moreover, orf  <dig> is a small predicted gene with a size of  <dig> bp and encodes for a unique protein in phage jg <dig>  this orf was identified by two programs, genemark and orf finder, independently. no functional indication could be pointed out since there are no similarities to other proteins in the databases and no conserved domains have been detected in orf  <dig>  we also searched the genome of phage jg <dig> for promoters, terminators and regulatory elements, see methods. the pb <dig> phages do not contain a phage rna-polymerase and depend on the transcriptional machinery of the host bacterium. putative sigma 70-promoter regions have been predicted in pb <dig> phages  <cit> . we detected two putative sigma 70-promoter regions in the 5'-region of orf  <dig> and orf  <dig>  similar to the position of the putative promoters found in pb <dig> phages, see table  <dig> and figure  <dig> <cit> . in addition, we also determined the location of six rho-independent transcriptional terminators and checked if their position is conserved to the other pb <dig> like phages, table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  moreover, we searched for additional conserved motifs in intergenic regions using meme and detected at-rich boxes and additional conserved motifs in intergenic regions. however, the function of the motifs is unclear, their position indicates a possible function as a recognition sequence for a phage sigma factor as suggested earlier  <cit> .

position and orientation of putative sigma  <dig> promoters and putative rho-independent terminator regions. the putative promoters were identified using sak and virtual footprint as described in methods. "orf" indicates the orf in the 3'-region of the putative promoter. bold letters of the promoter sequences indicate - <dig> and - <dig> regions. the putative terminator regions were identified using the programs transterm and findterm as described in methods. the indicated orf is the respective orf in the 5'-region of the putative rho-independent terminator.

asm infection assay
since phage jg <dig> is able to infect 84% of the tested clinical isolates in vitro we were interested if this phage is able to infect p. aeruginosa under simulated cf lung conditions. an artificial sputum medium  was used to mimic the cf lung environment. growth in asm leads to formation of typical biofilm-like microcolonies of p. aeruginosa and supports other phenotypic changes observed under chronic infection conditions  <cit> . at first, we tested the ability of phage jg <dig> to lyse the non-mucoid wild type strain p. aeruginosa pao <dig> in asm compared to lb medium. as described in methods, we monitored phage particles and noted an increase of phage particles by a factor of nearly  <dig>  <dig> in lb and in asm by a factor of  <dig>  <dig> . this indicates cell lysis by phage jg <dig> under these non ideal conditions . when we monitored infection of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> in asm we noticed a 50-fold lower concentration of phage particles. this indicates a reduced efficiency of phage infection by jg <dig> under simulated chronic infection using the artificial sputum medium. in parallel we tested a p. aeruginosa cf-isolate, strain bt <dig>  for susceptibility to phage infection in lb and asm. unexpectedly, we noticed only a  <dig> -fold lower phage number in asm compared to lb . we noticed that phage jg <dig> was less effective against the cf isolate under both conditions, since approximately tenfold less phage particles were produced under both conditions compared to pao <dig>  however, while strain bt <dig> is less susceptible to phage lysis, the efficiency does not decrease dramatically under asm growth conditions.

in contrast to the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> strain the cf-isolate bt <dig> is mucoid and secretes the exopolysaccharide alginate. we wondered if alginate overproduction could explain the observed results. it was recently published that even non-mucoid strains like the wild type pao <dig> express the exopolysaccharide alginate in response to oxygen-limiting conditions  <cit> . we also observed that cultures of pao <dig> in asm, which mimics the cf lung, were highly viscous compared to the cultures in lb medium, suggesting a high production of alginate by the wild type pao <dig> in this medium. if alginate is the factor in our experimental setup which decreases phage infection efficiency, a mucoid variant of strain pao <dig> should show a similar result as the clinical isolate bt <dig>  therefore, we repeated the phage infection experiments in lb and asm with a p. aeruginosa muca mutant strain. we observed again only a  <dig> -fold decrease in asm and an overall approximately tenfold reduction in phage particles when compared with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> . these results are in agreement with our hypothesis that alginate overproduction reduces phage infection efficiency. moreover, they point to alginate as the dominant factor for the decrease in phage infection efficiency in asm. to verify this result, we performed the same experiment with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> in lb medium and increasing alginate concentrations. we chose alginate concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> μg/ml up to  <dig> μg/ml, since non-mucoid p. aeruginosa strains have been reported to produce 50- <dig> μg/ml alginate, while mucoid isolates produce up to  <dig> μg/ml alginate  <cit> . in accordance with our hypothesis, the presence of alginate reduced phage multiplication in our test assay. a concentration of  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml alginate resulted in an almost 20-fold reduction of phage particles compared to lb medium alone in accordance with the 50-fold reduction of phage particles observed in asm compared to lb. this effect is even more obvious with alginate concentations of  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml, where we observed a reduction of phage particles by a factor of  <dig> and almost  <dig>  respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
we could show that the phage jg <dig> belongs to the pb1-like phages and shares several characteristic features of this group. these phages are widespread in nature and very successful. a new member of this group, phage jg <dig>  was isolated and characterized. general growth characteristics as well as the genome were investigated, showing that jg <dig> is able to pass one infection cycle in approximately  <dig> min. genome analysis revealed the strong relatedness to the pb1-like phages. moreover, we could show that jg <dig> has broad spectrum activity with a prevalence to clinical isolates. also, infection of the host p. aeruginosa was even possible under challenging conditions like the asm medium which mimics the cf lung. high viscosity and microcolony growth of the host were only small obstacles for jg <dig> to infect and multiply under these conditions. these results show that this group of bacteria could be an important contribution to phage therapy. moreover, we established a method to investigate the possibility of a phage to lyse bacteria under infection conditions prior to use for phage therapy in vivo.
