BACKGROUND
the biological interpretation of dna microarray experiments to measure gene expression requires contrasting the detected patterns of gene expression  with the functions of the genes that correspond to those patterns. because of the high number of genes interrogated by this technique, human interpretation is difficult and a number of computational methods have been developed. since there are a number of resources that contain annotations of genes with terms of the gene ontology  describing the related pathways, processes, or cellular locations of the gene products  <cit> , many of these computational methods use go annotations attached to genes as a means to describe microarray experiments .

in the case of the affymetrix dna microarrays, probe set annotations with go terms are provided and updated on a regular basis . however, although the number of probe sets covered with gene information and go annotations tends to increase from release to release, we noticed upon analyses of particular experiments that these annotations could be improved. on the one hand, we observed that some probe sets were linked to a database entry annotated with go terms that could be directly transferred. on the other hand, we found helpful to have a supply of predicted go terms obtained by inference from the content of different databases, increasing the level of gene description, and, in some cases, providing functional information to genes not yet annotated.

with this idea in mind, we have used two strategies to amplify the go annotations associated to affymetrix probe sets:  direct transfer of go annotations from related databases; and  inferred transfer for the predictions that requires examining associations between go terms and annotations from one or more linked databases.

RESULTS
we obtain go annotations from four types of sources . source  <dig> consists of the go terms originally associated by netaffx to a probe set. source  <dig> consists of go terms found in database entries linked to the probe set by netaffx. source  <dig> consists of predicted go terms obtained from inferred relations between go terms and terms from other controlled vocabularies present in database entries linked to the probe set. source  <dig> consists of predicted go terms inferred from go terms already derived from sources  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  for a probe set.

we have evaluated our method for the probe sets of both the moe <dig> and hg-u <dig> affymetrix dna microarrays for the mouse and the human genomes, respectively, using the netaffx release from december  <dig>  in the case of hg-u <dig>  the set of annotations produced  consists of  <dig>  go term annotations that cover  <dig>  probe sets out of a total of  <dig>  in the microarray, including annotations for  <dig>  probe sets without any go term . these  <dig>  go term annotations have a recall of the annotations given by netaffx  of  <dig> % . the figure of precision respect source  <dig>  does not necessarily indicate that the system performs badly as the main use of this system is to produce new annotations. some of those are already well known but not found in netaffx and some are predicted. an example of the latter case is probe 219280_at from chip hg-u <dig> representing the uncharacterized protein wd repeat domain  <dig> that was annotated with the go term "nucleus go:0005634" by our system . this protein corresponds to swissprot entry q9nsi <dig>  which is annotated with two keywords describing its domain content: "bromodomain" and "wd repeats". according to the inferred relations described above, the swissprot keyword "bromodomain" is included in the go term "nucleus". the association accounts for the fact that bromodomains are found in many chromatin associated proteins. this type of associations between swissprot keywords and protein cellular locations have been used before for prediction  <cit> . here we introduce a system that expands the concept by including in general all gene ontology terms and all databases possibly linked  to a probe set.

in total, the method produced  <dig>  new annotations for the probe sets of the hg-u <dig> affymetrix dna microarray . for this calculation we have also considered the structure of the ontology : a term derived from source n was not considered new if it was an ancestor of any other term found in sources m â‰¤ n. in absolute numbers, source  <dig> was clearly the one producing the most of the new annotations, with sources  <dig> and  <dig> producing one order of magnitude less of annotations. we note that probe sets lacking any go annotation in the netaffx table did very rarely receive new annotations from source  <dig>  and did not receive any new annotation from source  <dig> as they derive from other go annotations. source  <dig> and source  <dig> annotations applied, therefore, mostly to probe sets with already some degree of previous annotation.

for reference, the netaffx release used for this analysis  added  <dig>  new annotations respect to the previous one of june  <dig>  the application of our protocol to that previous release produced a total of  <dig>  new annotations of which  <dig>  were included in the netaffx december  <dig> release. we note that those  <dig>  were mostly from source  <dig> , which agrees to the fact that netaffx annotations are derived by direct transfer from other databases  <cit> .

to test the validity of the predicted new go terms, we manually evaluated random selections from the  <dig>  new annotations for the probe sets of the hg-u <dig> affymetrix dna microarray mentioned above for each type of source. as it could be expected, we found that the new terms derived from source  <dig>  were by far the most reliable . the terms from source  <dig> were less reliable  with source  <dig>  producing the least reliable set of new annotations . go annotations were taken as valid if they were supported by experimental evidence or by reasonable sequence features. we illustrate this with two examples.

a positive example is the association to probe set 201034_at of the source  <dig> go term go: <dig>  by inference from the go-term "structural constituent of cytoskeleton", which was associated to this probe by netaffx. probe set 201034_at, according to netaffx, refers to the add <dig> gene, that encodes the adducin  <dig>  protein. adducins are cytoskeletal actin-binding proteins  <cit>  and then this prediction counted as valid.

a negative example is the association to probe set 36829_at of the source  <dig> go term go: <dig>  by inference from the keyword "transcription regulation", which was found in the swissprot entry o <dig>  linked to the probe set by netaffx. however, although "transcription regulation" often implies an interaction with dna, this particular protein has not been proven to directly interact with dna, and it does not contain domains indicating such function. it regulates transcription by forming complexes with several dna-binding proteins such as the cryptochrome  <dig> protein . therefore this prediction counted as invalid.

we have established a public web server  coded in perl with a back-end based in a local mysql database server. users can retrieve amplified go annotations for a given probe set . the server allows tracing the path of evidence followed to derive these annotations, which should allow users to select annotations to their desired level of reliability.

in order to support computational methods that rely on the complete set of go annotations for the probe sets in a chip, those can be obtained following the links indicated in the probe2go entry page. these files will be updated with every netaffx release.

following the recommendation of the go consortium to indicate an evidence code for all go annotations, we note that since the association between a probe set and a gene is subject to the interpretation of the related genomic information and this can change over time , all our go annotations should receive the iea  evidence code according to  <cit> : "annotations transferred from database records, if not reviewed by curators".

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a resource to expand the go annotations of affymetrix probe sets that we have developed motivated by our needs to expand probe set annotations as much as possible.

our future goal is to add to our protocol other databases and links that could serve as sources of additional evidence to improve the specificity of the predictions , as well as to apply the protocol to an expanding number of microarrays.
