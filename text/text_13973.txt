BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen, responsible for causing pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, otitis media and sepsis, in humans. pneumococcal disease causes a considerable burden on health services and is responsible, worldwide, for over  <dig>  million deaths per year in children under the age of  <dig> years, with many of these cases occurring in developing countries  <cit> .

new developments in conjugate vaccines are exciting but are based on the polysaccharide capsule of the pneumococcus and with more than  <dig> pneumococcal serotypes and genetic exchange of the capsular loci between s. pneumoniae contributing to the enhanced evasion from serotype specific antibody  <cit>  alternative vaccines are still required. the drug of choice for treatment of pneumococcal infections has, for a long time, been penicillin. however over the last  <dig> years, resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics in s. pneumoniae has spread rapidly  <cit> . it is important to find new therapeutic targets to aid in the design and discovery of novel drugs as well as implementing genetic screening to identify individuals at risk so they can be targeted for prophylactic treatment.

determination of genetic factors would open a radically new approach to prophylaxis and host defence. studies of cause of death in adopted children and familial and twin studies have shown that susceptibility to infectious disease has a strong genetic component  <cit> , but the genetics involved are complex and likely to be polygenic. the mapping of complex or quantitative trait loci  in naturally out-bred populations such as humans has been limited in success and identifying candidate genes has largely been restricted to association studies. mouse models have been used to identify qtl with extensive homologies in humans and this approach has been successful in identifying infection susceptibility loci. one particularly successful example is the gene nramp <dig> that was identified as a candidate for susceptibility to tuberculosis by genome wide linkage studies in mice, and subsequently in humans by case control association studies  <cit> .

we have reported previously on a mouse model of susceptibility to systemic pneumococcal infection in which balb/c mice are resistant and cba/ca susceptible to intranasal infection with s. pneumoniae d <dig>  <cit> . a major qtl responsible in part for this difference in susceptibility has been mapped, in progeny of an f <dig> intercross, to proximal chromosome  <dig> and was named spir <dig>   <cit> . variants of several genes in the human population have been implicated in susceptibility to pneumococcal infection, including c reactive protein  <cit> , mannose binding lectin  <cit> , tirap  <cit>  and ptpn <dig>  <cit> , but the mouse orthologs of these genes are not located in the spir <dig> locus  <cit> .

in this present study, mapping of further progeny from the f <dig>  intercross has identified a novel qtl on chromosome  <dig>  which we have named spir <dig> . the contribution of this locus to susceptibility to pneumococcal infection was confirmed by congenic mapping.

RESULTS
identification of a novel qtl  on chromosome  <dig> contributing to both survival time and bacteraemia
selective genotyping of ccbaf <dig> mice, with phenotypes representing the extremes of the response after infection challenge, identified a region of significant linkage on chromosome  <dig> with the traits of survival time and bacteraemia . the peak of linkage was located at snp 4_ <dig>  at  <dig>  mb. the qtl location on chromosome  <dig>  estimated by the one lod support interval, was from snp 4_ <dig>  at  <dig>  mb to snp 4_ <dig>  at  <dig>  mb and was ~  <dig> mb in size. the lod score for the peak of linkage exceeded the genome wide significance threshold of  <dig>  with a lod score of  <dig>  for survival and  <dig>  for bacteraemia. the qtl identified on chromosome  <dig> was estimated to account for 8% of the phenotypic variance. detection of the spir <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> was replicated in this study, also accounting for ~ 8% of the phenotypic variance .

effect of genotype at spir <dig> on phenotype
in the susceptible group of ccbaf <dig> mice the overall distribution of genotypes at snp 4_ <dig> were not significantly different from the expected mendelian ratios. however, the distribution of genotypes in the resistant group of ccbaf <dig> mice was significantly different from the expected 1:2: <dig> ratio, at snp 4_ <dig>  if genotype had no effect . there were a higher proportion of resistant mice heterozygous at this marker, compared to the proportion of resistant mice with cba/ca or balb/c homozygosity at snp 4_ <dig> .

observed numbers of mice were compared to the expected numbers  if genotype had no effect using a χ <dig> test.

in order to investigate the effect of genotype at snp 4_ <dig> on the time to become moribund, a kaplan-meier survival analysis was performed . ccbaf <dig> mice heterozygous for snp 4_ <dig> showed a significant difference in the time before exhibiting disease signs when compared to mice homozygous for balb/c  or cba/ca . the mean and median survival times were calculated for each ccbaf <dig> genotype group. the median survival time, at which 50% of the group became severely lethargic, was  <dig> hours for both balb/c and cba/ca genotypes. there was no median survival time calculated for the heterozygous genotype, as more than 50% of the group survived to the end of the experiment. the numbers of bacteria in the blood at  <dig> hours after intranasal infection were also significantly lower in ccbaf <dig> mice, which were heterozygous for the peak of linkage, when compared to those which were homozygous for balb/c or cba/ca at the same snp . these data suggest that being heterozygous at this location on chromosome  <dig> is advantageous.

congenic breeding confirms the contribution of the spir <dig> locus to susceptibility to pneumococcal infection
the strategy of congenic breeding was used to replicate detection of the chromosome  <dig> qtl and to assess its contribution to the infection phenotype. incipient congenic strains consisting of different portions of the chromosome  <dig> qtl from balb/cbyj on a cba/cah background, and vice versa, were produced using a marker-assisted breeding scheme.

the percentages of heterozygosity observed in the n <dig> and n <dig> males used for breeding further generations were between  <dig> and 42% for the n <dig> generation and  <dig> to 10% for the n <dig> generation. mice with the cba/cah spir <dig> locus on a balb/cbyj background were bred to the n <dig> generation before intercrossing. these incipient congenics were named byjcban6- <dig>  mice with the balb/cbyj spir <dig> locus on a cba/cah background were bred to the n <dig> generation and were named cbabyjn7- <dig>  the estimated percentage recipient genome in the final incipient congenic mice tested for infection susceptibility was  <dig>  to  <dig> %. therefore these mice were similar to n <dig> mice produced by conventional congenic breeding.

balb/cbyj spir <dig> locus on cba/cah background 
a total of  <dig> cbabyjn7- <dig> intercross mice were tested for susceptibility to s. pneumoniae infection. of these  <dig> mice  <dig>  were resistant to pneumococcal infection and the remaining  <dig>  were susceptible. six of the susceptible mice survived  <dig> hours or longer, while the rest only survived to between  <dig> and  <dig> hours.

a survival analysis was performed on the cbabyjn7- <dig> mice for each snp on chr <dig> and it was found that animals that were heterozygous at snp 4_ <dig> survived longer by comparison with those homozygous for the cba/ca allele. similar results were found at snp 4_ <dig> . these results do not achieve statistical significance , yet are noteworthy because they show the same trend as the spir <dig> qtl detected in the ccbaf <dig>  . there was no difference in time to morbidity between mice homozygous for balb/cbyj and those homozygous for cba/cah at any chr <dig> marker. there was also no significant difference in the numbers of bacteria in the blood at  <dig> hours post-infection in cbabyjn7- <dig> mice homozygous for balb/cbyj or cba/cah or heterozygous for any of the chromosome  <dig> snp markers .

a total of  <dig> mice could be divided into  <dig> haplotypes based on their combination of genotypes at snps 4_ <dig> to 4_ <dig>  these groups were called cbabyjn7-4-a to k . there was no significant difference in numbers of bacteria in the blood at  <dig> hours post-infection between any of the cbabyjn7- <dig> haplotypes . however, there was a significant difference between the survival curves of cbabyjn7-4-b and g  with a lower risk of disease in the cbabyjn7-4-g mice compared to the cbabyjn7-4-b mice .

cba/cah spir <dig> locus on balb/cbyj background 
a total of  <dig> byjcban6- <dig> intercross mice were tested for susceptibility to infection with s. pneumoniae. ten  of these mice were susceptible and  <dig>  were resistant to pneumococcal infection. an analysis of the survival of these mice, based on their genotype at markers on chr <dig>  revealed significant differences for snps 4_ <dig>  4_ <dig> and 4_ <dig> . mice homozygous for the balb/cbyj allele of any of these three snps were at significantly less risk of disease than those homozygous for cba/cah at the same snp. survival curves for mice that were heterozygous for the snp 4_ <dig>  were significantly different from those for cba/cah homozygotes , with more heterozygotes surviving. there were no significant differences in the survival curves for animals of any of the genotypes for snp 4_ <dig>  however this marker did follow the same trend as for snps 4_ <dig>  4_ <dig> and 4_ <dig> .

numbers of bacteria in the blood of byjcban6- <dig> mice were assessed at  <dig> hours post-infection. there were significantly more bacteria present in mice homozygous for the cba/cah allele at snp marker 4_ <dig> or 4_ <dig> when compared with mice either heterozygous or homozygous for balb/cbyj at the same snp . although not significant, the trend was the same for snp markers 4_ <dig> and 4_ <dig> .

analysis of the combination of alleles at snps 4_ <dig> to 4_ <dig> was performed on the byjcban6- <dig> mice. of the  <dig> mice,  <dig> could be placed into one of five different haplotypes, named byjcban6-4-a to e . kaplan-meier analysis of the five haplotype groups revealed a significant difference in the survival curve of byjcban6-4-a mice, which were homozygous for balb/cbyj at all four snps when compared with byjcban6-4-e mice, which were homozygous for cba/cah at these snps  . analysis of the bacteraemia results at  <dig> hours post-infection also revealed a significant difference between byjcban6-4-a and e mice . byjcban6-4-e mice had significantly higher numbers of bacteria present in the blood when compared with byjcban6-4-a mice, which had no bacteraemia at  <dig> hours .

discussion
selective genotyping of ccbaf <dig> mice from the phenotypic extremes was successful in identifying a novel qtl on chromosome  <dig>  contributing to susceptibility to pneumococcal disease. this type of selective genotyping has been implemented in various studies because it reduces laboratory costs and it is successful in gaining as much, if not more, information as genotyping the same number of random mice  <cit> . the spir <dig> peak of linkage was situated at snp 4_ <dig> and ccbaf <dig> mice that were heterozygous for this snp had both significantly longer survival times and lower levels of bacteraemia, following intranasal infection, when compared with homozygous animals. infection challenges of the chr <dig> incipient congenic strains confirmed detection of the spir <dig> qtl observed in the ccbaf <dig> mice, but did not reduce the size of the critical region.

byjcban6- <dig> mice, which had the spir <dig> region introgressed from cba/cah onto the balb/cbyj background, had significantly shorter survival times after infection and significantly higher levels of bacteraemia at  <dig> hours when compared with mice heterozygous for the qtl or homozygous for balb/cbyj. the effect of the qtl was different when on the cba/cah background. interestingly, although not quite significant, mice heterozygous for snps 4_ <dig> and 4_ <dig> on the cba/cah background were less susceptible than those homozygous for cba/cah or balb/cbyj. these results are similar to the effect observed in the analysis of the ccbaf <dig> qtl. although the mechanisms are currently unclear, there have been reported cases in which heterozygous genotypes are advantageous over either homozygous genotype. a well-documented case of this phenomenon is the sickle cell gene haemoglobin  in humans. carriers of the sickle cell trait are heterozygous for the hb genotype  and this heterozygosity seems to be protective against malaria, with lower mortality and parasitaemia when compared with either homozygous hb genotypes   <cit> . the differences observed in the phenotypes of the incipient congenics in our study were dependent on the recipient genome and this highlights the probable contribution of epistatic interaction effects from the background.

the region containing the spir <dig> locus is approximately  <dig> mb in length and overlaps with several published qtl involved in immunity or susceptibility to infection; bbaa <dig> , a locus contributing to severity of arthritis induced by b. burgdorferi infection  <cit> , lprm <dig> , a qtl conferring susceptibility to autoimmune vasculitis  <cit> , sle <dig> , contributing to b cell hyperactivity, an immunogenic phenotype caused by the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythmatosus  <cit>  and marif <dig>  which affects inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages such as secretion of tnfα and il-12p <dig>  <cit> . it is premature to speculate whether any of the genes underlying these qtls are shared, but the marif <dig> locus is of interest because of the opposite th1/th <dig> bias of the inbred strains balb/c and cba/ca  <cit>  and because we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have shown that macrophages play an important role in susceptibility to pneumococci.

the spir <dig> locus region contains  <dig> genes, according to ensembl v. <dig>  one strong candidate gene, based on it’s known role in regulating innate immunity, is tlr <dig> <cit> , but non-synonymous differences in the sequence of tlr <dig> between balb/colahsd and cba/caolahsd were found to be common to other inbred strains, making it less likely to play a role in the spir <dig> locus . it is clear that sequence analysis of the entire qtl would aid the prioritisation of other candidate disease genes for further study.

CONCLUSIONS
the spir <dig> and spir <dig> loci are linked significantly to both bacteraemia and survival time . this may mean that the principle cause of death, in our model of pneumonia, is bacteraemia and the downstream inflammatory effects it precipitates in the host.
