BACKGROUND
ws is a human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and the premature onset of a number of age-related diseases
. the defective enzyme responsible for ws possesses a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity in addition to a 3′-5′ helicase activity
 <cit>  and is involved in dna repair, replication, transcription, and telomere maintenance
. we previously generated a mouse model with a deletion in the helicase domain of the murine wrn homologue
 <cit>  that recapitulates most of the ws phenotypes, including an abnormal hyaluronic acid excretion, higher reactive oxygen species  levels, dyslipidemia, increased genomic instability, and cancer incidence
 <cit> . overall, such mutant mice have a 10-15% decreased of their mean life span
 <cit> . interestingly, the treatment of wrn mutant mice with vitamin c reverted the life span of such animals to the normal wild type phenotype
 <cit> .

the wrn protein is a member of the recq family of dna helicases
 <cit> . it is highly conserved across species including in invertebrates such as the small worm caenorhabditis elegans . interestingly, the exonuclease and the dna helicase domains homologous to the human wrn protein are encoded by two different genes in c. elegans
 <cit> . the c. elegans wrn- <dig> gene codes for the atp-dependent 3′-5′ dna helicase capable of unwinding a variety of dna structures
 <cit> . notably, it has been shown that the rnai knockdown of the c. elegans wrn- <dig> gene shortens the life span, increases sensitivity to dna damage, and accelerates aging phenotypes
 <cit> . similarly, a c. elegans strain lacking the expression of the wrn- <dig> helicase protein ) also exhibit a shorter life span when grown at 25°c
 <cit> . interestingly, supplementation of vitamin c normalizes the median life span of the wrn- <dig> mutant worms
 <cit>  as seen in mice lacking part of the helicase domain of the wrn protein
 <cit> . thus, the wrn- <dig> mutant worm model gives us the opportunity to examine the global mrna expression of a whole animal upon vitamin c treatment.

in this study, we analyzed the global mrna expression of wild type and wrn- <dig> mutant c. elegans in the presence or absence of vitamin c by rna-seq. rna-seq has been shown to be quantitatively accurate over a larger range of expression levels than previous methods, such as microarrays
. our results indicate that wrn- <dig> mutant animals showed significant changes in biological processes affecting several carbon structures  and oxidation-reduction reactions. although supplementation of vitamin c significantly increased the life span of both wild type and wrn- <dig> mutant worms, no gene was similarly affected by vitamin c in these strains. vitamin c altered the expression of genes in wrn- <dig> worms involved in locomotion and anatomical structure development. proteolysis was the only biological process significantly affected by vitamin c in wild type worms. these results indicate that the expression profiling of wrn- <dig> worms revealed a very different response to the addition of vitamin c compared to wild type worms.

RESULTS
vitamin c increases the life span of both wrn- <dig> and wild type c. elegansstrains
to assess the impact of vitamin c on longevity, we measured the life span of wrn- <dig> and wild type c. elegans strains grown at 25°c in the absence or presence of 10 mm ascorbate  as described before
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the median life span of vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms was significantly increased by 26%  compared to untreated wrn- <dig> animals . these results replicate previous data obtained with these strains
 <cit> . interestingly, the median life span of vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms was close to the median life span of wild type worms . the median life span of vitamin c treated wild type worms was significantly increased by 22%  compared to the untreated wild type animals . these results indicate that vitamin c increased the life span of both strains by more than 20% at 25°c.figure  <dig>

strains. the difference in longevity between vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> and untreated wrn- <dig> c. elegans strain grown at 25°c is significant . the difference in longevity between vitamin c treated wild type  and untreated wild type  c. elegans strain grown at 25°c is significant . all experiments were performed four to six times with  <dig> to  <dig> worms per genotype. p-values were obtained using the log-rank test method.



transcriptome characterization of the wrn- <dig> animals compared to the wild type strain
to gain insight into the rescuing effect of vitamin c on the life span of wrn- <dig> worms, we first established the global expression profile of untreated wild type and mutant worms at the l <dig> stage by rna-seq. by carefully monitored physiological developmental cues , we noticed a three hours developmental delay in wrn- <dig> mutants compared to wild type animals. therefore, mrna was extracted based on the biological age  and not on the chronological age of the animals for the rna-seq analyses. table 
 <dig> contains the number of raw reads for each biological replicate . the normalized counts for each biological replicate are shown in the additional file
1: table s <dig> for all the c. elegans genes. a preliminary list of differentially expressed genes was generated by keeping the genes that showed a two-fold difference or more between wild type n <dig> and wrn- <dig> worms with an adjusted p-value < <dig> . this first list contained  <dig> genes . we randomly chose  <dig> genes representing a range of base mean number from  <dig> to  <dig> reads in both or in either n <dig> or wrn- <dig> mutant animals based on the rna-seq normalized data  to determine the minimum of reads required for a gene to be detected by rt-pcr in our analyses. we thus designed  <dig> pairs of primers to validate the differential expression of these genes by quantitative rt-pcr. the tubulin encoding gene  was included as a control . polya + rna was thus extracted from three plates of wild type and from three plates of wrn- <dig> worms . the rt-pcr results are shown in table 
 <dig> and the sequences of the primers are provided in the additional file
2: table s <dig>  every rt-pcr product was examined on a 2% agarose gel at the end of each run. figure 
 <dig> shows examples of such gels for ten of these genes. a pcr product was detected only in samples that showed more than  <dig> reads by rna-seq . for example, no band corresponding to nlp- <dig> mrna could be detected with the mrna samples and no ct could be detected by quantitative rt-pcr. the mean number of reads is below  <dig> for nlp- <dig> mrna in both the wild type and the wrn- <dig> worms . similarly, no arrd- <dig> mrna could be detected from wild type or wrn- <dig> worms mrna pools even after 40 cycles of pcr . the normalized counts for the arrd- <dig> gene were below  <dig> in both genotypes for all biological replicates . no ct could be detected by quantitative rt-pcr. in contrast, a band for the ugt- <dig> gene was detected with mrna from the wild type worms only  worms) . the mean number of reads was lower than  <dig> for ugt- <dig> in the wrn- <dig> worms but higher than  <dig> in the wild type worms . finally, table 
 <dig> indicated expression differences for pes- <dig>  cyp-34a <dig>  cyp-33e <dig>  sodh- <dig>  ugt- <dig>  ech- <dig>  nas- <dig>  gpx- <dig>  acs- <dig>  acs- <dig>  asah- <dig>  lys- <dig>  y46g <dig> , and daf- <dig> genes between the wild type and the wrn- <dig> strains by rt-pcr analyses and such results confirmed the rna-seq data. a mean number of reads greater than  <dig> was found in at least one of the genotypes following the rna-seq analysis for these genes . based on such results, we generated a final list of genes showing at least a two-fold difference in expression between wild type and mutant worms, an adjusted p-value < <dig> , and a mean number of reads > <dig> in at least one of the worm strain. these criteria were applied to each comparison hereafter in this report. additional file
3: table s <dig> gives a final list of  <dig> genes differentially expressed between wild type and wrn- <dig> worms. there were  <dig> down regulated and  <dig> up regulated genes respectively  in the wrn- <dig> worms compared to the wild type worms.table  <dig>

the david classification tool was used to classify differentially expressed genes by their functions in specific biological processes. categorization of the genes in our list  revealed ten significantly up regulated biological processes  in the wrn- <dig> worms compared to wild type worms . major biological processes that were up regulated in wrn- <dig> worms included oxidation-reduction processes, lipid, organic acid, cellular ketone, and carbohydrate metabolic processes . there was no significant down regulated biological processes .table  <dig>

transcriptome characterization of wrn- <dig> and wild type strains treated with vitamin c
we compared the global mrna expression of synchronized untreated worms with synchronized worms grown with vitamin c until the l <dig> stage. lists of genes differentially expressed were generated by requiring that the absolute value of the fold change be higher than two, that the mean number of reads for each gene be higher than  <dig> for at least one of the genotype, and the adjusted p-value be lower than  <dig> . when we compared the global expression of untreated wrn- <dig> worms with vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms, we found  <dig> genes to be differentially expressed  between both populations . david analysis on this list of genes revealed enrichments for two main down regulated biological processes . the main affected processes included genes involved in locomotion and anatomical structure development. no significant biological processes were up regulated . when we compared the global expression of untreated wild type worms with vitamin c treated wild type worms, we found  <dig> genes to be differentially expressed  between both populations . david analysis on this list of genes revealed a significant down regulation of only one set of genes involved in proteolysis . finally, the list of genes in the vitamin c treated wild type versus untreated wild type worms was very different from the list of differentially expressed genes in untreated wrn- <dig> versus vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms. only four genes were regulated in a similar way in both lists and they included mup- <dig>  c27d <dig>  , f12a <dig> , and ugt- <dig> . the mup- <dig> gene encodes a transmembrane protein required for junctional attachments between hypodermis and muscle
 <cit> . the ugt- <dig> gene encodes a protein with putative udp- glucuronosyltransferase activities . the c27d <dig>  and f12a <dig>  genes code for uncharacterized proteins . these results indicate that although vitamin c increased the life span of both mutant and wild type worms, it affected different sets of genes and biological processes in both strains.table  <dig>

the life span of wrn- <dig> worms treated with vitamin c is similar to the life span of untreated wild type worms . we therefore compared the global expression of vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms with the global expression of untreated wild type worms. there were  <dig> down regulated and  <dig> up regulated genes in the vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms compared to untreated wild type worms, respectively . categorization of the genes in our list using david revealed three significantly up regulated biological processes  in the vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms compared to untreated wild type worms . major biological processes that were up regulated in vitamin c wrn- <dig> mutant worms included lipid, cellular ketone, and organic acid metabolic processes .table  <dig>

we next examined the genes that were commonly altered in untreated and vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms taking the global expression of the wild type strain as a reference. the venn diagrams in figure 
 <dig> indicate on one hand that the expression of  <dig> genes from the wrn- <dig> worms were changed similarly in the absence or presence of vitamin c when compared to wild type worms. there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes down and up regulated, respectively, in the wrn- <dig> worms with or without vitamin c compared to untreated wild type worms. the list of these genes can be found in . david analyses on the commonly up and down regulated genes indicated that the wrn- <dig> mutation increased the expression of genes involved in oxidation-reduction, cellular ketone, organic acid, and lipid metabolic processes . these results indicate that vitamin c did not revert the expression of genes involved in these biological processes in the wrn- <dig> worms.figure  <dig>

potential transcription factors involved in vitamin c response in wrn- <dig> and wild type c. elegans
we next performed a transcription factors binding site enrichment analysis on the promoters of the genes altered by vitamin c in both wrn- <dig> and wild type strains. we used publically available chip-seq data recently generated for  <dig> transcription factors in c. elegans
 <cit> . promoter analysis of all the genes differentially expressed by vitamin c in wild type worms revealed a significant enrichment of binding sites for nhr- <dig> and mab- <dig> transcription factors . the c. elegans nhr- <dig> protein is an orphan nuclear hormone receptor with zinc finger domains required for dna binding . mab- <dig> is a homeodomain transcription factor related to the antennapedia and ultrabithorax family of homeodomain proteins. it regulates proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis in c. elegans
 <cit> . the expression of nhr- <dig> and mab- <dig> genes was not significantly changed in vitamin c treated compared to untreated wild type animals . these results suggest that vitamin c altered the activity of these transcription factors at a post-transcriptional level in wild type animals.

promoter analysis of all the genes differentially expressed by vitamin c in wrn- <dig> mutant worms revealed a significant enrichment of binding sites for tlp- <dig>  nhr- <dig>  pha- <dig> and nhr- <dig> transcription factors . tlp- <dig> is a zinc finger protein of the sp family of transcription factor. it is a transcription factor that acts downstream of wnt signals and that control cell polarity and patterning in c. elegans
 <cit> . nhr- <dig> is a nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor involved in body fat regulation in c. elegans
 <cit> . pha- <dig> is a transcription factor of the foxa  family that mediates diet-restriction induced longevity in c. elegans
 <cit> . it also antagonizes the target of rapamycin pathway in c. elegans
 <cit> . the expression level of these four transcription factors in wrn- <dig> mutant worms was not significantly changed by the addition of vitamin c . these results suggest that vitamin c altered the activity of these transcription factors at a post-transcriptional level in wrn- <dig> mutant worms.

discussion
we have previously observed that homozygous mice lacking exons encoding part of the helicase domain of the werner syndrome gene product have a reduced mean life span of  <dig> % compared to wild type mouse
 <cit> . importantly, such mutant mice exhibit an abnormally high oxidative stress that can be neutralized by supplementation of vitamin c in drinking water
 <cit> . in fact, vitamin c re-established the normal mean life span of wrn helicase mutant mice. interestingly, c. elegans lacking the wrn- <dig> helicase ortholog also have a reduced mean life span compared to wild type worms
 <cit> . the global mrna expression of whole wrn- <dig> worms by rna-seq analyses indicated major changes in set of genes involved in overall carbon metabolism . these results are consistent with the premature aging phenotype observed in worms with a reduced wrn- <dig> helicase activity
 <cit> . although the analysis was performed on mrna from l <dig> stage c. elegans, altered expression of these genes will have an effect on the duration of adulthood. indeed, alterations in reactive oxygen species and atp levels has been observed in adult wrn- <dig> mutant worms
 <cit> . notably, alteration in the expression of several sets of genes involved in growth and lipid or fatty acid metabolism has not only been observed in cultured wrn mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts but also in the liver of wrn helicase mutant mice
 <cit> . importantly, since we noticed a three hours developmental delay in wrn- <dig> animals compared to wild type, we carefully monitored physiological developmental cues  in both animal population before harvesting them to perform mrna analysis . therefore, the change of the expression profile of genes involved in different biochemical pathways observed between wrn- <dig> mutant and wild type animals reflect accurately the difference detected at a specific developmental time point rather than a developmental shift caused by the loss of wrn- <dig>  detailed comparative microscopic and genetic analyses along with global mrna expression analyses at several developmental stages will be necessary to acquire a better picture of changes as a function of not only chronological but also biological age in wrn- <dig> mutant animals.

vitamin c treatment increased the mean life span of wrn- <dig> worms to untreated wild type levels. this is similar to the result obtained with mice. vitamin c supplementation rescued the shorter mean life span of wrn mutant mice
 <cit> . vitamin c also significantly increased the life span of wild type c. elegans . we did not see an increase in the life span of wild type mice supplemented with vitamin c in a previous study
 <cit> . unlike mice, wild type c. elegans do not have the enzyme required for the synthesis of their own vitamin c as far as we can tell. however, c. elegans contains three potential cytochromes b <dig> encoding genes 
 <cit> . cytochromes b <dig> are intrinsic membrane proteins containing two heme molecules, and reducible by ascorbate. they have been suggested to function as electron transporters, shuttling electrons across membranes from ascorbate to an acceptor molecule. the one-electron oxidation product of ascorbate, monodehydro-ascorbate has been shown, at least in vitro, to function as an electron acceptor for cytochromes b <dig>  this reaction results in the regeneration of a fully reduced ascorbate molecule
 <cit> . the presence of cytochromes b <dig> encoding genes in c. elegans suggests that this species could potentially use vitamin c in different chemical reactions
 <cit> . the impact of vitamin c on the levels of different metabolites required for energy or impacting on ros levels in the body of wild type and wrn- <dig> c. elegans is currently under investigation. interestingly, the expression of the f39g <dig>  gene is reduced in wrn- <dig> mutants  but was not changed by the addition of vitamin c . the f39g <dig>  gene may be required for the regeneration of ascorbate from monodehydro-ascorbate in wrn- <dig> mutants, a hypothesis that will require confirmation.

our results indicate a major difference in gene expression response to vitamin c between wild type and mutant worms. the list of differentially expressed genes in untreated wrn- <dig> mutants versus vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> mutants was very different from the list of genes in vitamin c treated wild type versus untreated wild type worms . these results indicate that although vitamin c increased the life span of both mutant and wild type worms, it affected different sets of genes in both strains. another important difference is that the mean life span of vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms is shorter  than vitamin c treated wild type worms  . the median life span of wrn- <dig> worms treated with vitamin c was close to untreated wild type worms. the expression profile of vitamin c treated wrn- <dig> worms compared to untreated wrn- <dig> worms revealed down regulation of genes involved in biological processes related to locomotion and anatomical structure development. upon examination of the global mrna expression analysis of treated and untreated wrn- <dig> worms , we found that the expression of  <dig> genes at the mrna level was similarly altered in mutant worms compared to wild type worms in the presence or absence of vitamin c. the expression of these genes was affected by the wrn- <dig> mutation but was not reversed by vitamin c suggesting that alteration in expression of these genes is not required for the impact of vitamin c on c. elegans life span. these genes are involved in oxidation-reduction, cellular ketone, organic acid, and lipid metabolic processes . thus, vitamin c extended the life span of wrn- <dig> worms by altering biological processes not only involved in locomotion but also in anatomical structure development . such processes are indeed affected at the physiological levels, as a knock down of wrn- <dig> protein expression by the rna interference technique results in various developmental defects, including small, dumpy, ruptured, transparent body, growth arrest and bag of worms
 <cit> .

the mechanism by which vitamin c alters gene expression in mutant and wild type c. elegans is unknown. our analysis of enrichment for specific transcription factor binding sites in the altered genes in the presence of vitamin c have indicated changes in the activity of hormone receptor-type transcription factors  and of pha- <dig>  a transcription factors which activity depends on pathways affecting the status of several metabolites and/or nutrients in c. elegans. one important pathway modulated by metabolites is the cetor pathway that affects pha- <dig> activity
 <cit> . our hypothesis is that vitamin c not only affects the redox status of cell in c. elegans, but also important metabolites that may be used as ligands for nuclear receptors  or for signaling molecules that regulate the activity of different transcription factors. metabolomics analysis with both wrn- <dig> mutant and the n <dig> wild type strains in the absence or presence of vitamin c is underway and is the scope of another study.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, our study indicates that 10 mm vitamin c in the growth media increases the mean life span of the wrn- <dig> mutant and the n <dig> wild type strains at 25°c. however, the alteration of gene expression by vitamin c is different between wrn- <dig> and wild type strains. based on our criteria to generate lists of differentially expressed genes between genotypes, we observed alteration in the expression of  <dig> genes in wrn- <dig> worms compared to wild type worms. vitamin c did not significantly modify the alteration of  <dig> of these genes. such genes are mainly involved in oxidation-reduction, cellular ketone, organic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid, metabolic processes. vitamin c, in return, altered the expression of several genes in wrn- <dig> worms involved in locomotion and anatomical structure development. it is interesting to mention that vitamin c can rescue the morphology of liver and adipose tissues of wrn helicase mutant mice
 <cit> . this report thus provides lists of genes that can potentially affect the healthy aging of not only wild type but also wrn- <dig> worms upon genetic manipulation in the presence of vitamin c. it also provides important clues on the biological processes that vitamin c affects to increase life span in c. elegans.
