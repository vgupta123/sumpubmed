BACKGROUND
during recent years an important effort has been made to increase the tools available for the genomic analysis of major plant crop species. since the first genome sequence available of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , several others have been published. they include model plants such as brachypodium  <cit>  but, increasingly, species that have been chosen for their importance in agriculture. for example the rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , sorghum  <cit>  or soybean  <cit>  genomes are complex but the wealth of genetic information matches their economic interest. consequently, for both scientific and economic reasons an increasing number of plant genomes are being analyzed, providing important resources useful for their biological study and breeding.

several species of interest from both scientific and economic perspectives are of the cucurbitaceae family. these include melon, cucumber, watermelon and squashes, all of which have been the object of biological and agricultural interest for centuries. in recent years various molecular tools have been established. for instance, the first assembly of the cucumber genome  <cit> , as well as an increasing number of genetic and genomic resources developed for melon, a diploid species with a relatively compact  genome  <cit> . these include tools such as a collection of more than  <dig>  ests  <cit> , bac libraries  <cit> , oligo-based microarrays  <cit> , tilling and ecotilling platforms  <cit> , a set of near isogenic lines   <cit>  and several melon genetic maps  <cit> . recently, we have built a physical map with  <dig> x genomic coverage using both a bac library and a genetic map previously developed in our laboratories , the first report of such a genomic resource of a cucurbitaceae species so far. this physical map has also been integrated with the genetic map by anchoring a number of physical contigs  to  <dig> known genetic markers. these tools have been useful in the study of interesting agronomical traits such as virus or fungi resistance  <cit> , sex determination  <cit>  or the control of ripening  <cit> . these results demonstrate that molecular genetic approaches can successfully be used in melon to address basic questions of biological or agronomic relevance.

more extensive sequence information would be invaluable to complete the picture of the melon genomic landscape. indeed, the sequences of only a few selected genomic regions have been published, totaling no more than  <dig> kb  <cit>  and as of may  <dig> no more than  <dig> melon genes can be found in genbank  <cit> , although a collection of ests probably representing more than 70% of the transcriptome is currently available  <cit> . the sequencing of the sorghum genome has shown the feasibility of sequencing a plant genome larger than that of melon  using a sanger-based whole genome shotgun approach  <cit> . however, the development of new massively parallel sequencing technologies allows envisaging a complete sequencing of the species at higher speed and at lower cost than previous sanger-based methods. to this end, both whole genome sequencing approaches as well as map-based, bac-to-bac strategies have been proposed to sequence plant genomes  <cit> .

a small number of research projects involving  <dig> sequencing of bac clones have currently been published. in a pioneering study aimed at analyzing how  <dig> technology would perform on template derived from large genomes rich in repetitive content, four barley bac clones 102- <dig> kb long, two of which had been previously sequenced using sanger technology, were sequenced using  <dig>  <cit> . the results showed that gene-containing regions could efficiently and accurately be assembled into contigs, even at read coverages as low as x <dig> 

in a later work eight bacs belonging to a minimum tiling path covering ca.  <dig> mb of the atlantic salmon genome were sequenced using  <dig> technology, the first published use of paired-end reads for de novo sequence assembly  <cit> . this study demonstrated that although the inclusion of paired-end reads greatly improved sequence assembly, there remained a significant number of gaps when compared to sanger-generated sequencing data. thus the authors concluded that, when it comes to de novo sequencing complex genomes,  <dig> sequencing should be restricted, at least for the time being, to establishing a set of ordered sequenced contigs.

although these studies show that  <dig> sequencing can be used to assemble gene-containing regions from genomic sequences using a bac-to-bac approach, the cost of  <dig> sequencing individual bacs has led to consider pooling individual clones as a means to increase throughput and reduce the cost of genome sequencing. in one published study,  <dig> bacs totalling  <dig> mb were divided into six pools of overlapping bacs, aided by paired-end sequencing. these were then used to 454-sequence a minimum tiling path which covered an entire chromosome arm from oryza barthii  <cit> . the report shows that pooling bacs does not increase the complexity to a degree that makes assembly impossible, what makes this approach a feasible strategy for reducing the cost of bac sequencing. in another work  <dig> barley bac clones, pooled by sets of  <dig> or  <dig>  were sequenced using  <dig> technology  <cit> . the introduction of short sequence tags to fragmented bac dna prior to pooling and sequencing helped to resolve the assembly of multiplex sequencing data by establishing relationships between bac clones and sequence reads, reducing sample complexity.

here we present a pilot project aiming to sequence two pools of  <dig> and  <dig> melon bacs using the  <dig> system and a combination of shotgun and paired-end sequencing. the goal of the study was twofold: obtain sequence data for a significant proportion of the melon genome and thus insight into its structure, and test the strategy of massively sequencing pools of bacs. the results obtained allow an accuracy assessment of  <dig> sequence and assembly data as compared with sequence data produced using classical sanger technology. overall, the study provides approximately  <dig> mb or  <dig> % of the melon genome as a first step towards the complete sequence. the analysis of this data has provided insight into characteristics of the melon genome such as gene density, transposon content and synteny with cucumber.

RESULTS
selection of bac clones for pooling and sequencing
two pools of dna prepared from bacs were sequenced using the  <dig> pyrosequencing method. these bacs had been produced from dna of the double haploid line pit <dig> obtained from the cross of pi  <dig> and t <dig> as described in  <cit> .

a set of  <dig> genetic markers selected from previous versions of the pi  <dig> × t <dig> melon genetic map  were used to anchor  <dig> bac clones from our genomic library to the genetic map  <cit> . of these, a batch of  <dig> bacs anchored to genetic markers distributed throughout the genome  were chosen for 454-sequencing. in order to test the quality of the sequencing and assembly procedures, one previously sanger-sequenced bac  was selected from the mrgh <dig> contig constructed on the basis of bac end information  <cit> . we also added to the pool bacs cm43_h <dig> and cm14_m <dig> of this contig that are known to overlap with the former . in all, this first pool of bac clones consists of  <dig> bacs mapping to  <dig> different loci.

a second batch of  <dig> bacs anchored to genetic markers distributed throughout the genome but different from those corresponding to the first set of  <dig> bacs was also chosen for 454-sequencing . three additional bacs were included in this second pool: the above-mentioned bac cm43_h <dig>  and two randomly chosen bac clones not linked to any known genetic marker . in all, the second pool consists of  <dig> bacs mapping to at least  <dig> different genetic loci.

in all, the selected two sets of bacs represent an estimated  <dig>  mb of the melon genome, based on bac library average insert size. the complete list of selected bac clones, together with their corresponding genetic markers can be found in table  <dig>  information regarding genetic map position, marker type and references of the genetic markers can be found in the additional file  <dig> table s <dig>

sequencing and assembly
both shotgun and  <dig> kb paired-end libraries were constructed for each pool of bacs and the sequencing was carried out independently as described in the methods section. a summary with the details of the different  <dig> runs, including number of reads, total length and average read size can be found in table  <dig>  in total, over one million reads representing  <dig> mb of sequence from the  <dig> bacs pool and over  <dig>  reads totaling  <dig> mb from the  <dig> bacs pool were produced. the raw data  have been deposited in the sra archive of the ncbi under the accession number sra <dig> .

a global assembly of all reads from both bac pools was performed as described in the methods section. in addition, two independent assemblies were performed using reads from each pool. the reduced complexity in the separate assemblies of individual pools of bacs would suggest a more accurate assembly. indeed, the number of contigs slightly increases and their size decreases in the global assembly, but overall, the result of the global assembly resembles the results from the assemblies of the individual bac pools, except for a few cases. for example, in the case of the bac cm54_i <dig>  we obtained a single scaffold in the  <dig> bacs pool assembly corresponding to two scaffolds from the global assembly. what separates the two scaffolds  is a  <dig> bp gap flanked by several ta motives. on the other hand, scaffold <dig> from the global assembly contained  <dig> additional nucleotides and a  <dig> bp long gap flanked by at repeats at one of its extremes compared to its counterpart scaffold from the  <dig> bacs pool assembly. as we do not have a reference genome, we considered the larger scaffold as reference. a detailed summary of the whole process with the metrics of the three assemblies can be found in table  <dig>  based on this information, we conclude that for assembling a modest number of bacs it is not worth separating them in smaller pools , and if reduction of complexity is imperative  then the extreme approach could be considered and barcode each bac.

*reads from all  <dig> bacs were processed together in one assembly run. additional assemblies of each bac pool were independently done and served for comparison purposes and to manually correct some scaffolds in the global assembly

aonly contigs larger than  <dig> bp

btwo previously published bacs were included in this scaffold 

ccontigs larger than  <dig> bp

the assignment of contigs and scaffolds to bacs was performed using anchored genetic markers and bac-end sequences as described in the methods section. also, the information from the c. melo fpc physical map  <cit>  together with bac-end sequences from some bac clones in fpc contigs allowed us to manually edit two scaffolds of the final assembly. the physical map was also useful in assigning bacs cm21_i <dig> and cm12_i <dig> to their corresponding scaffolds, as no genetic markers correspond to these bacs. finally, the previously sanger-sequenced bac cm60_k <dig>  was added to the alignment of the sequenced bacs from the mrgh <dig> contig in order to extend the sequence used for subsequent analysis .

the final assembly consists of  <dig> scaffolds totaling  <dig>  mb, 73% of which are longer than  <dig> kb, with average scaffold size  <dig>  kb and the largest scaffold  <dig> kb long; also,  <dig> unscaffolded contigs totaling  <dig> kb of sequence remain . the sequence coverage of the final assembly is 39x, calculated as the ratio between the total length of the sequence reads and the assembly sequence length. paired-end reads are used in the process of sequence assembly to join contigs  in structures called scaffolds, which represent sorted and correctly orientated contigs that are separated by gaps which sizes are estimated based on the average paired-end size . the n <dig> contig size of our assembly was rather small  compared to the n <dig> scaffold size . this result confirms the importance of paired-ends when it comes to assembling a complex genome using  <dig> sequences.

regarding the assignment of sequences to particular bacs, bac cm47_c <dig> could not be assigned to any scaffold or contig and bac cm46_i <dig> was assigned to a small contig of less than  <dig> kb using the genetic marker sequence information, and to another two small scaffolds using both bac-end sequences. all other bacs were assigned to a unique scaffold or contig, two of which were smaller than  <dig> kb, another five in the 60- <dig> kb range while the rest was over  <dig> kb long .

the search for bac ends in the final set of contigs and scaffolds suggests that at least  <dig> scaffolds cover the complete sequence of  <dig> bacs . an average of seven stretches of ns  was found per scaffold and the total length of all ns accounts for  <dig> % of the final assembly length . nine additional scaffolds assigned to as many bac clones were found to contain only one bac border each; however, six of these scaffolds were bigger than  <dig> kb, and so they probably represent complete bac sequences but for small deletions at their borders, while the rest measured between  <dig> and  <dig> kb and could represent a significant proportion of their correspondent bac sequences. finally, bac borders were absent from two bac sequences , both smaller than  <dig> kb and therefore most likely incomplete.

as a summary, of a total of  <dig> pooled bacs, most likely complete sequences were produced for  <dig> bac clones, three were incomplete but in the range of 60- <dig> kb and four bacs were attributed very limited sequence information. as the assignment was performed using a small amount of sequence information, namely the marker and bac-end sequences , any sequence shorter than the full bac insert size has few chances of being assigned to any particular bac. this is obvious for the bac cm46_i <dig> where with each bac-end sequence and the marker sequence we assign three rather small sequences . in our results, a total of  <dig> kb distributed in  <dig> contigs/scaffolds longer than  <dig>  bp remained unassigned after the final assembly and could account for most of the sequence of those four problematic bacs. all markers but one , and all available bac-end sequences but three, matched against a contig or scaffold. the nucleotide sequences of contigs and scaffolds assigned to bacs as well as of those unassigned assembly sequences larger than  <dig> kb have been deposited in the genbank database and their accession numbers can be found in the additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

the number of gaps per mb  and the estimated amount of missed sequence in our main assembly  are lower than those values from the above-mentioned studies using  <dig> sequencing of bac clones  <cit> , a fact most probably due to the absence of paired-end sequencing in  <cit> , to the short reads that were being produced at the erlier stages of  <dig> technology   <cit> , to the complexity of the barley and salmon genomes as compared with melon's  <cit> , and to the higher amount of assembled sequence in the case of o. barthii  <cit> . in summary, although using shotgun and paired-end libraries of pooled bacs remains a costly proposition for sequencing a whole genome, it is well adapted to certain situations. indeed, our results show that it is a feasible and cost-efficient strategy for sequencing particular regions of interest of relatively compact genomes like that of melon. this approach would also be useful in genome walking strategies for gene cloning, or resolving a particular region where a physical map is available.

sequence accuracy assessment
the quality of the final assembly was assessed by comparing the sequence from scaffold mrgh <dig> corresponding to bac cm13_j <dig>  against the  <dig> kb-long sequence of the same bac previously obtained using a shotgun-sanger approach  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the differences between the sanger and  <dig> sequences. apart from five small stretches of ns representing  <dig> % of the bac length, the only other discrepancies are  <dig> homopolymeric regions and two dinucleotide tandem repeats. the differences in homopolymeric regions were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> mononucleotide repeats longer than  <dig> nt, and in all cases but one the  <dig> repeat resulted to be one to three nucleotides shorter than the sanger sequence. it is interesting to note that no differences were found in the  <dig> mononucleotide repeats shorter than  <dig> nt. the discrepancies in dinucleotide tandem repeats affected two  <dig> and  <dig> microsatellites.

2number of homopolymers in the  <dig> sequence showing differences with the corresponding homopolymers in the sanger sequence

it has been already described that sanger and  <dig> technologies have a generally comparable level of accuracy regarding genic regions or other single-copy sequences, homopolymeric stretches being the main source of read errors in both techniques when low copy regions are considered  <cit> . previous reports have also shown that longer stretches of a and t are more likely to cause problem when using pyrosequencing  <cit> . indeed, there is a tendency of homopolymers to be shorter in the  <dig> sequence than in the sanger reads, although at least a report exists where the stretches were consistently found to be one nucleotide longer in the  <dig> sequences  <cit> . in summary, the polymorphisms detected between the melon  <dig> and sanger sequences in a  <dig> kb interval involved only  <dig>  differences every  <dig>  bp, a figure close to previously reported values  <cit> .

besides homopolymers, repetitive dna is known to be more problematic for  <dig> sequencing than for sanger due to the shorter length of the  <dig> reads. repetitive regions can be collapsed into one consensus contig causing gaps to appear in the final assembly. this may be the main reason behind the gaps accounting for an estimated loss of ca. 5% of melon sequence in our final assembly. indeed, all five stretches of ns in cm13_j <dig> consensus sequence are found in two regions that contain repetitive sequences such as a transposable element and a tir-nbs-lrr resistance gene .

sequence annotation
ab initio prediction of protein coding, trna and rrna genes was carried out as described in the methods chapter. the predictions were validated by homology with protein sequences at ncbi databases and with ests from the melon unigene v <dig> database at icugi  <cit> . a census of simple sequence repeats  was also performed using the msatcommander software.

a summary of the sequence and annotation features of all  <dig> contigs and scaffolds longer than  <dig> kb, representing  <dig>  mb of genomic sequence, can be found in table  <dig>  as a whole,  <dig> protein coding genes  were predicted, of which  <dig> % were found to show homology with known c. melo ests. the average gene density is estimated to be  <dig>  genes for each  <dig> kb but varies on the 2- <dig> range when individual scaffolds are considered; the average intron and exon length are respectively  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp and number of exons per gene is  <dig> , with 46% of coding sequence being introns. predicted proteins were  <dig> aa long on average. regarding ssrs,  <dig>  microsatellites were found representing  <dig> % of the total sequence, about one ssr every  <dig>  kb. the gc content composition was 33%, eleven trna genes were found in five bac clones and no rrna genes could be found in the analyzed sequence. additional file  <dig> table s <dig> contains a more detailed report of the individual characteristics of each scaffold or contig larger than  <dig> kb.

gsee table  <dig> for a more detailed analysis of transposon content

the recent publication of the cucumber sativus genome sequence begs the comparison of sequence and annotation characteristics of both cucurbit species  <cit> . overall, the statistics of protein-coding genes from both cucurbits are quite similar. the predictions for the cucumber genome are a gene density of  <dig> per  <dig> kb, mean protein length of  <dig> amino acids, average number of exons per gene, exon length and intron length of  <dig> ,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, and trna gene density of  <dig>  per mb. while the gene density, mean exon length and average number of exons per gene are very similar in both species, in cucumber the protein length is only slightly smaller , and mean intron length is just  <dig>  times greater.

the apparent similar gene density, together with the similarity in average protein length, number of exons and average exon and intron lengths, seems contradictory with the difference in genome size between both species. indeed, the estimated size of the melon genome is  <dig> x that of cucumber  <cit> . it has to be taken into account, however, that the cucumber gene density was calculated based on as much as 70% of the complete genomic sequence, which most probably included gene-poor regions, while the melon gene density has been estimated using bac clones that have gene- or est- based genetic markers and thus probably represent gene-rich regions. therefore, it might be the case that the actual melon gene density is lower than that of cucumber, hypothesis that is supported by the analysis of syntenic regions from both genomes .

transposon content of the sequenced bacs
transposons were annotated using sequence similarity searches with previously characterized transposons as well as by ab initio methods based on transposon structural characteristics. as expected, most of the elements found belong to the retrotransposon class of mobile elements, with the gypsy family being the most represented. however, the fraction of the genome these elements occupy is apparently smaller than in other genomes of similar size. indeed, while retrotransposons account for 20% of the genomes of grapevine  and lotus japonicus   <cit> , these elements seem to account for only  <dig> % of the melon genome  . retrotransposons are not randomly distributed in genomes and while some elements preferentially integrate in gene-rich regions , others target heterochromatic regions for integration, in particular those belonging to the gypsy family which are usually present at higher copy number  <cit> . thus, the apparent low retrotransposon copy number could be due to the fact that heterochromatic regions are under-represented in the  <dig> % fraction of the genome analyzed, which was selected to be representative of the gene-rich regions of the melon genome.

we have also found representatives of all the major families of dna transposons, including cacta, mule, hat, pif and helitron elements, covering in total  <dig> % of the analyzed sequence , which is consistent with what has been reported for the genomes of grapevine   <cit>  and lotus japonicus   <cit> .

afrom the analysis of all contigs and scaffolds longer than  <dig> kb

analysis of microsynteny
four of the longest scaffolds  were used to search the cucumber genome assembly  <cit>  for syntenic regions, as described in the methods section. as it can be expected from the close phylogenetic relatedness of these two species, a high degree of collinearity was found in all four regions analysed . the relative syntenic quality  ranged from 84%  to 97% , averaging 92%, and the homologous protein sequences rendered in all cases e-values lower than 1e- <dig> with an average identity of 87% when aligned using blastp . regarding the annotation characteristics of the predicted genes, the average protein lengths of the four melon regions analyzed were x <dig> -x <dig>  those of cucumber, with the syntenic melon genes being, as an average, only x <dig>  smaller than the cucumber ones; the average number of exons of the melon syntenic regions were x <dig> -x <dig>  those of the cucumber regions, with the syntenic melon genes having, as an average, only x <dig>  less exons than the cucumber ones; also, although the average exon length of all syntenic melon genes was almost identical to that of cucumber, the average intron length of the syntenic melon genes was x <dig>  that of their cucumber counterparts .

besides, the orientation of the putative syntenic genes was found to be conserved in all cases. however, a number of genes were duplicated in melon. these included the expansion of a cluster of nbs-lrr genes present in scaffold mrgh <dig>  which is particularly interesting as the vat gene and other disease resistance genes have been mapped to this region  <cit> . nbs-lrr genes are the main family of resistance genes in plants, and are frequently found in clusters  <cit> . highly conserved gene order and content together with 95% of sequence similarity over coding regions has already been reported by huang et al. based on the comparison of four sequenced bac clones against the sequenced cucumber genome  <cit> .

besides the duplication of several genes, a major difference between cucumber and melon syntenic regions is the number of transposon insertions . the cucumber sequences analysed contain only two retrotransposon insertions, one of which seems very old as it is highly degenerated. on the contrary, the melon syntenic regions contain three dna transposons  and  <dig> retrotransposons , including the degenerated retrotransposon found in cucumber. in particular, transposon activity appears to account for the expansion of ca.  <dig> kb in the melon scaffold <dig> relative to its cucumber counterpart. in scaffold mrgh <dig>  a localised transposon number amplification together with duplication of melon resistance gene homologs  accounts for an  <dig> kb-long expansion of the sequence of melon relative to that of cucumber. also, transposons were found to be putatively involved in gene disruption processes in scaffolds  <dig> and mrgh <dig> 

these results suggest that transposition activity after the divergence of the two ancestors of melon and cucumber has been low in cucumber but very high in melon. this transposon amplification and mobilization could be a reason for the  <dig> × increase in size of the melon syntenic regions. bearing in mind that the melon genome is estimated to be  <dig> × greater that of cucumber, it can tentatively be assumed that transposon activity may be mainly responsible for that difference in genome sizes.

it is interesting to note that almost half of the melon specific transposons are interspersed with nbs-lrr predicted genes that potentially form resistance gene clusters. gene duplications and transposon insertions have been proposed to provide a structural environment that permits unequal crossovers and interlocus gene conversion allowing rapid evolution of resistance genes  <cit> . in addition, the presence of active retrotransposons interspersed with resistance genes may also contribute to the resistance gene regulation by silencing related mechanisms  <cit> . a detailed analysis of syntenic regions containing putative resistance genes between melon and cucumber may provide new information on the evolution of resistance genes and the development of new resistances in cultivated crops.

CONCLUSIONS
a set of  <dig> bac clones from a double haploid line of melon was sequenced in two pools with the  <dig> system using both shotgun and paired-end approaches followed by bioinformatic assembly of the fragments obtained. from this assembly it was possible to obtain most likely complete sequences for  <dig> of these bacs, as judged by the length and the presence of bac-end sequences, with a final coverage of 39×. the accuracy of the assembly was excellent, compared with a bac clone already sequenced with the sanger method, except in a small number of repetitive sequences, consistent with other  <dig> sequencing projects  <cit> . these results show that 454-sequencing of pooled bacs, using both shotgun and paired-end libraries, is a feasible strategy for sequencing long stretches of genomic sequence from medium-size genomes such as that of melon. however, correction using other sequencing techniques would be needed for medium to high repetitive content regions.

the analysis of the fraction  of the melon genome obtained provides a pilot overview of this species' genomic structure. predicted gene annotations were confirmed in 73% of the cases by comparison with est collections. this is probably a good measure of the completeness of the transcriptome information currently available for this species. the analysis of the sequences provides an interesting overview of the features such as microsatellite content, gene density and average protein length, revealing similarity to that of its close relative, cucumber.

finally, the comparison of four melon regions totalling  <dig> kb against the genomic sequence of cucumber  reveals a high degree of collinearity between both species. the analysis of the detected syntenic regions suggests that the size difference of the two genomes is due to the expansion of intergenic regions, mainly through the activity of transposable elements in melon after the divergence of the two species. it is particularly interesting to note that almost half of the detected melon-specific transposons are interspersed with nbs-lrr predicted genes that potentially form resistance gene clusters. we have confirmed the utility of this sequencing method for small genomic fractions, and the analysis of the data thus obtained has expanded our understanding of the melon genome structure and the mechanisms underlying its evolution.
