BACKGROUND
insect vector-borne pathogens cause some of the most widespread infectious diseases worldwide, including dengue fever, yellow fever, malaria, encephalitis, filariasis, leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis  <cit> . the corresponding vectors are hematophagous insects that become infected by ingesting pathogens during blood feeding. transmission of the pathogen to a subsequent vertebrate host occurs during the acquisition of another blood meal.

hematophagy is a behavior exhibited by more than  <dig>  species of insects  <cit> , but genome-wide information regarding blood meal-regulated gene expression is available for only a few of these. remarkable differences in the levels of accumulation of specific transcription products following a blood meal were reported in the malaria vector mosquito, anopheles gambiae  <cit>  and as many as 50% of all transcripts varied significantly during a gonotrophic cycle. our study investigates blood meal-induced changes in transcript accumulation in the dengue vector mosquito, aedes aegypti, that last shared a common ancestor with the anophelines some 120- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . elucidating transcriptional changes in mosquitoes following a blood meal can reveal novel molecular targets and strategies for control of vector populations and pathogen transmission. alternative control strategies are required for dengue due to the continuous rise of cases worldwide  <cit> , the current lack of an effective vaccine and the fact that vector control strategies aimed at reducing human contact with ae. aegypti, the principal vector for all the four serotypes of dengue viruses , have largely failed  <cit> .

previous studies analyzing the effects of blood meals on ae. aegypti females were limited to the midgut  <cit> , muscle mitochondria  <cit>  or to specific gene sets  <cit> . transcriptome sequencing, or rna-seq, has emerged recently as a powerful tool to gain a holistic picture of the expression profile of an organism, tissue or cells  <cit> . using next-generation sequencing technologies , millions of cdna reads of a length dependent on the platform chosen are generated and can be used either to create a de novo transcriptome assembly  <cit>  or can be mapped to a reference genome to derive a genome-scale transcriptional map that consists of the structures of transcriptional units and their expression levels  <cit> . sequencing-based methods provide absolute rather than relative gene expression measurements avoiding many inherent limitations of microarray technologies  <cit> . additionally, rna-seq data can be analyzed to assess differential-splicing activity, discover novel regions of transcription and locate precise transcription product boundaries  <cit> .

we used the illumina rna-seq technology to compare the accumulation of transcription products in nonblood-fed female ae. aegypti and mosquitoes at five hours post blood meal . this time point was chosen so that we may evaluate early genome-wide transcriptional responses to a blood meal. results from our analyses assisted in refining the current annotation of the ae. aegypti genome, improved our understanding of the biochemical pathways and biological processes elicited shortly after a blood meal and identified promoters and/or putative cis-regulatory elements correlated with changes in accumulation of specific gene products occurring as a consequence of ingestion of a blood meal.

RESULTS
basic sequencing data
four rna-seq libraries were generated and sequenced from ae. aegypti females of the liverpool  strain. two libraries were prepared from total rna collected 3- <dig> day post eclosion from nonblood-fed females maintained with access to sugar  and the other two used rna from females of the same age but at  <dig> hours after blood feeding . in total,  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated and a close agreement between the technical replicates was confirmed by the pearson correlation coefficients of  <dig>   and  <dig>   . therefore, the data from parallel libraries were combined for further analyses.

differential transcript accumulation between nonblood-fed and blood-fed ae. aegypti females
rna-seq analyses showed that ~ 70% of all annotated ae. aegypti protein-encoding genes are expressed in both s and b mosquitoes . a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified with differential accumulation between s and b mosquitoes, with  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts in greater or lesser abundance, respectively, following a blood meal . quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr  on a random selection of thirteen genes showing differential accumulation levels confirmed both the direction and the magnitude of changes as shown by the spearman rho correlation value of  <dig>   and paired t-test value of  <dig>   .

detailed examination of the  <dig> transcripts showing increases in accumulation revealed that  <dig> are ≥50-fold more abundant in b mosquitoes, but that the majority  show less than a 2-fold increase. forty transcripts are detected exclusively in b mosquitoes . among the transcripts showing decreased accumulation following a blood meal,  <dig> were reduced between 2- and 5-fold in s when compared with b mosquitoes. only  <dig> transcripts were decreased ≥50-fold, and  <dig> transcripts were represented exclusively in s mosquitoes.

the functions of proteins encoded by ae. aegypti transcripts are predominantly theoretical and based on sequence similarities to those of other organisms. acknowledging this limitation, functional parent attributions were assigned  <cit>  for over 90% of the ae. aegypti conceptual translation products allowing a description of the biochemical and physiological changes occurring following a blood meal . blood feeding induced an accumulation of transcripts involved in lipid metabolism , protein degradation , ammonia/nitrogen metabolisms  and egg maturation . based on the pfam protein family database  <cit> , the  <dig> transcripts whose abundance was increased ≥ <dig> times in b versus s mosquitoes included those encoding two vitellogenins ,  <dig> digestive enzymes, a member of the cytochrome p <dig> family , a sugar transporter  and one transcript  encoding an orthologue of the g <dig> gene of an. gambiae . the g <dig> proteins in mosquitoes, thought to be secreted into the midgut lumen or maintained on the surface of microvilli, are encoded by transcripts that accumulate quickly in female midguts within one hour of blood feeding, reaching a maximum level of expression at about  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . the same pattern of g <dig> expression is seen in ae. aegypti females after feeding on blood infected with plasmodium gallinaceum  <cit> .

transcript levels of genes whose products are involved in redox metabolism, such as dehydrogenases and members of the cytochrome p <dig> family, as well as those implicated in iron ion binding, increase between 5- and 2-fold, but several genes whose products are involved in similar physiology are decreased up to 10-fold. furthermore, transcripts whose levels increased more than 5-fold are involved mainly in lipid and protein metabolism; levels of the majority of transcripts involved in trafficking/transport increased only slightly , if not decreased . these observations are consistent with the conclusion that  <dig> hours pbm represents a time when ae. aegypti females are beginning to respond actively to a blood meal through differential transcription. additionally, the pattern of expression detected at the whole-body level  <dig> hours pbm reflects what is seen in ae. aegypti midguts between  <dig> and  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> , which is consistent with the conclusion that the blood meal is the event that signals the start of the metabolic activity. transcripts involved in stimuli perception, such as those encoding odorant-binding proteins, were decreased, a finding that correlates with what is seen in an. gambiae females at  <dig> hours pbm  <cit> . interestingly, transcripts associated with genes whose products are involved in transcription and translation also decreased at  <dig> hours pbm . the apparent contrast between the enhancement of digestive activity, which is centered in the midgut, and the decrease in transcripts linked to transcription and translation may reflect changes in transcript abundance occurring at the whole-body level.

transcripts found exclusively in blood-fed mosquitoes
forty transcripts were found only in blood-fed mosquitoes, with the highest read-counts reaching ~1000/transcript, after normalizing for different library sizes . functional parent attribution for these transcripts is consistent with a role in digestion and in the progression of the gonotrophic cycle. specifically, two transcripts, aa5g <dig>  and aaspvi , correspond to the midgut serine proteases shown previously to be elicited by a blood meal in the midgut of ae. aegypti females  <cit> . seven other transcripts encode enzymes , and two are implicated in trafficking. transcripts aae014815-ra and aae005950-rb correspond to the vacuolar protein sorting 13b from yeast and the chloride channel protein  <dig>  respectively. ten transcripts are paralogous to the g <dig> gene of an. gambiae and share the insect allergen repeat motif. this motif is hypothesized to be a novel, insect-specific detoxifying domain implicated in the co-evolution of herbivorous insects and their plant hosts and also has been linked to nitrile-specific detoxification  <cit> . transcripts aael006126-rb and aael008921-rc are predicted orthologues of the culex quinquefasciatus vitellogenin-a <dig> gene and the drosophila melanogaster spaghetti squash  gene, respectively. the sqh gene product encodes the regulatory light-chain of non-muscle myosin ii, which is required for cytoplasmic transport in nurse cells during oogenesis and also has been implicated in germline rna interference  processes  <cit> .

transcripts found exclusively in sugar-fed mosquitoes
twenty-eight transcripts were found to accumulate significantly only in sugar-fed mosquitoes. parent attribution is consistent with roles in basal metabolism and stimuli perception. in particular, six of the  <dig> transcripts encode proteins with catalytic activity , three belong to the cytochrome p <dig> protein family , and five  are conserved hypothetical proteins that share the insect pheromone/odorant binding protein  domain  <cit> . two of the  <dig> correspond to putative cuticle proteins , and one transcript  encodes a protein similar to the product of spätzle 1a, which is required for the toll-dependent antimicrobial response in both adult and larval vinegar flies  <cit> . two transcripts  encode proteins with predicted transporter activity. the functions of the proteins encoded by the remaining nine transcripts are unknown.

transcripts related to pathogen interaction
blood feeding is the primary port of entry into mosquitoes for viral, protozoan and metazoan pathogens that cause diseases in vertebrates. while blood is a source of nutritive resources for mosquitoes, it also is potentially harmful to them, and a balance between these factors determines their fitness  <cit> . two mechanistically different innate immune defense mechanisms have been described in ae. aegypti: one relies on gene expression control and degradation of mrna through the small rna regulatory pathways   <cit>  and the other induces the production of antimicrobial peptides and/or promotes phagocytosis, encapsulation and melanization of pathogens through the toll, imd and jak-stat signaling pathways  <cit> . the activities of the genes in these pathways have been analyzed in ae. aegypti challenged by injection with various pathogens including bacteria  <cit> , the filarial worm brugia malayi  <cit> , sindbis and dengue viruses  <cit> . transcriptional activation of innate immunity genes occurs within minutes after infection and the response lacks immunologic memory  <cit> . additionally, it has been hypothesized that the natural bacterial flora in mosquitoes maintains a basal level of immune response  <cit>  and that immunity processes share bio-products, such as reactive oxygen species , with digestion  <cit> . as a consequence, analyzing the basal expression of immunity genes shortly after a blood meal could help identify elements that govern vector competence and clarify the level of synergy among immunity and digestive processes. early transcriptional responses to a blood meal are relevant particularly with respect to dengue infection as viruses can be internalized within 5- <dig> minutes of contact between the virions and the mosquito midgut epithelial cells  <cit> , and viral replication is evident in the midgut two days post infection  <cit> .

among the  <dig> transcripts identified by comparative genomic analyses in silico and manual annotation that have established or putative associations with defense mechanisms  <cit>  ,  <dig> were expressed differentially with  <dig> and  <dig> showing lesser and greater accumulation in blood-fed mosquitoes, respectively . several classes of genes, including those encoding receptors and effectors of the immunity cascade   <cit> , were represented highly among those that showed decreased transcript accumulation following the blood meal . fold-changes ranged between  <dig>   and  <dig>  , with the majority  decreasing more than 2-fold. one transcript  was found exclusively in sugar fed mosquitoes. fourteen transcripts decreased >5-fold, including two members of the clip-domain serine protease  and three c-type lectins .

fold-changes for the  <dig> transcripts showing increased accumulation vary between  <dig>  and  <dig> , the former corresponding to transcript aael008073-ra, a srrp member, and the latter to transcript aael015136-ra, belonging to the md2-like protein  group. md2-like genes encode secreted proteins containing a lipid recognition domain that acts as intermediate in the immune response. the observed expansion of the mosquito md- <dig> gene family may indicate a specialized function of their products in the defense against pathogens ingested with blood meals  <cit> . three other md2-like transcripts  increase in abundance at  <dig> hours pbm, although not more than  <dig>  fold. in addition to aael015136-ra, only two other transcripts , not classified in any of the canonical immunity gene categories  <cit> , accumulate more than 5-fold . the majority of transcripts  accumulated less than 2-fold higher in blood- versus sugar-fed mosquitoes. the negative regulators of the toll and imd pathways, cactus  and caspar , were  <dig> -and  <dig> -fold, respectively, more abundant.

a number of genes involved in autophagy, srrp members and inhibitors of apoptosis had transcripts whose accumulation increased significantly following a blood meal . the maximum increase observed,  <dig>  fold, was detected for the inhibitor of apoptosis iap <dig> . autophagy is a tightly-regulated catabolic process whereby cells degrade intracellular components via the lysosomal machinery and it plays an important role in homeostasis maintenance, cell development, growth and immunity  <cit> . the increase in accumulation of autophagy genes and of members of the inhibitors of apoptosis is not surprising considering the time-point,  <dig> h pbm, sample here. among the  <dig> srrp members showing increased transcript accumulation, four, dicer  <dig> , tsn , dicer <dig>  and piwi <dig> , were at least 2-fold more abundant following a blood meal. dicer <dig> and tsn are essential components of the rna interference  effector multi-component rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> , and dicer <dig> has been shown to control gene expression of 'housekeeping' genes  <cit> . piwi <dig> is a member of the piwi small rna  pathway proposed to be involved in anti-viral defense  <cit> .

cis-regulatory element discovery
tightly-regulated and blood meal-induced expression profiles are of particular interest for designing transgenic mosquito-based control strategies to reduce transmission of dengue fever. cis regulatory sequences derived from blood meal-induced/up-regulated mosquito genes allow potentiating swift induction and effective levels of transcription of an associated effector gene, while likely inflicting the least fitness cost  <cit> . we interpret the different levels of mrna accumulation seen in this study to reflect changes in transcriptional activity of the corresponding genes, although it is possible that some levels may vary as a function of changing transcript stability or rates of turnover. with this in mind, we used scope  <cit>  to predict putative cres that may provide the basis for rational identification and selection of new candidate promoter regions and for modification of the transcriptional profiles of current transgene constructs. we examined the  <dig> base pairs  flanking the 5'-boundaries of the  <dig> transcripts that were undetected in libraries from sugar-fed mosquitoes but detected at significant levels in the rna-seq libraries from blood-fed mosquitoes and identified a redundant list of  <dig> motifs that are enriched significantly in these sequences . a possible cis-regulatory module  constructed with the discovered cres is represented by the motif consensus sequences, cnatcnkcwgtt, gyactyvar, and tgakamga, and is associated with ae. aegypti paralogues of the g <dig> gene of an. gambiae  . aedes aegypti has  <dig> g <dig> genes, many more relative to other insects, which have  <dig>  on average   <cit> . the transcripts of nine of the g <dig> paralogues are present in this co-regulated gene set .

another putative crm contains the consensus sequence tgakamga, cnatcnkcwgtt, asttrccc and aarcttbd . this crm groups with the cathepsin b genes, aael015312-ra and aael007585-ra. verification of these crms will require empirical testing, however, the top  <dig> matches for tgakamga, which is present in both putative crms, align well to members of the mosquito-conserved gata motifs correlated to transcriptional responses to blood feeding in an. gambiae  <cit> .

rna-seq identifies annotation corrections
rna-seq also provides an opportunity to examine and improve the current annotation of the ae. aegypti genome and examine the level of transcriptome plasticity in terms of alternative splicing. we used hmmsplicer  <cit>  to compare junctions revealed by our data to the annotation provided by vectorbase and ensembl  <cit> . hmmsplicer predicted  <dig>  junctions supported by at least two rna-seq reads using the combined data from sugar and blood-fed samples. of these,  <dig>   matched junctions present in the aaegl <dig>  gene-build provided by vectorbase, leaving  <dig>  predicted novel high-scoring splice sites supported by multiple rna-seq reads  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  of these occur within annotated gene boundaries and may represent un-annotated alternatively-spliced transcripts. to estimate how many of the remaining splice junctions might be truly novel, we mapped them to increasingly larger dna fragments flanking the currently-annotated genes . a total of  <dig>  junctions mapped within  <dig>  bp of the 5'- or 3'-ends of annotated gene boundaries. of these,  <dig> mapped within  <dig> bp, consistent with the interpretation that they may represent alternatively-spliced transcripts of the previously-identified genes. those mapping beyond  <dig> bp could be alternate junctions of the known genes, represent un-annotated transcription products or be artifacts.

1extending to either the 5'- or 3'-end of the annotated gene .

an accurate gene annotation, especially with respect to the transcription start site , is paramount for the accurate discovery of cres because prediction tools must make the assumption that the sequences included are true regulatory regions, and their performance suffers when this is false. for the cre predictions described in the previous section,  <dig> of the  <dig> transcript start sites were in close agreement to the ensembl annotation  <cit> . figure  <dig> highlights three determined amendments to the current annotation, all supported by est data. figure 4a and 4b supports the conclusion that the current annotation has missed the putative first exons that extend the 5'-utrs of some genes  and provides additional information for predicting accurate transcriptional start sites . in the case of aael <dig>  the tss determined by rna-seq data is  <dig> kb to the 5'-end of the annotated start site, far outside the distances commonly searched for cres . in some cases, as was seen for aael <dig>  the first exon was annotated but included as a separate gene model, which also contains the likely 5'-utr of aael <dig> . aael <dig> encodes a protein comprising  <dig> amino acids with no known functional domains aside from a predicted signal peptide that makes up 66% of its length.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide a detailed examination of the changes in transcripts accumulation occurring at the whole-body level of ae. aegypti females  <dig> hours pbm. the observed changes are consistent with the beginning of an intense physiological response to a blood meal. the majority of immunity-related transcripts tended to accumulate at lower levels in blood fed mosquitoes. this finding supports the hypothesis that there may be a gap in immunity following a blood meal. reduced expression of immune genes in blood fed mosquitoes could favor the establishment of infections, especially considering that pathogens such as dengue viruses infect the midgut epithelial cells within minutes after the contact  <cit> . however, changes in transcript abundance observed at the whole-body level may mask changes in accumulation occurring primarily in the midgut. different levels of activation of immunity genes after a blood feeding may be one of the factors contributing to the variability in vector competence for dengue viruses observed in different geographic populations of ae. aegypti  <cit> . the quantity and quality of data generated by rna-seq technology makes this an ideal approach for comparative analyses of the transcriptome of ae. aegypti strains with different vector competence and vectorial capacity.

our analyses of the expression profiles of s and b mosquitoes allowed the identification of co-regulated genes and putative cis-regulatory elements and modules from the ae. aegypti genome. further knowledge of the mechanisms involved in regulation of gene expression in vector species is critical to the development of control strategies whereby the vector is modified genetically to express anti-pathogen effector molecules in tissue-specific and time-regulated manners  <cit> . promoter and other cis-acting regulatory dna fragments are needed to regulate restricted expression of selected anti-pathogen effector molecules. moreover, we described several examples of how the rna-seq data generated can help improve the current annotation of the ae. aegypti genome.
