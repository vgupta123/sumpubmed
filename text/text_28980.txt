BACKGROUND
cultivated rice , as one of the most important agricultural crops, supplies the main dietary source for more than half of the world’s population  <cit> . although it is well accepted that cultivated rice was domesticated from common wild rice  thousands of years ago  <cit> , the origin and domestication process of cultivated rice have been debated for decades through different studies . until recently, it was revealed that o. sativa l. ssp. japonica had been first domesticated from a specific population of o. rufipogon around the middle area of the pearl river in southern china, and that o. sativa l. ssp. indica had been subsequently developed from crosses between japonica and local wild rice as the initial cultivars spread into southeast and south asia  <cit> . along with a multitude of studies on rice origin, further work is needed to genetically elucidate the substantially phenotypic and physiological changes from wild rice to cultivated rice at the whole genome level.

this study conducted comparative genomics analysis between o. sativa l. spp. japonica var. nipponbare and dongxiang wild rice , a chinese common wild rice . dxwr was firstly discovered in dongxiang county, jiangxi province of china in  <dig>  <cit> , which was considered as the most northern one  of the regions where common wild rice populations had been discovered around the world. during the past three decades, dxwr has been well investigated as a precious genetic resource for cultivated rice improvement or fundamental research on genetic diversity  <cit> , heterosis  <cit> , cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> , fertility restoration  <cit> , biomass  <cit> , high yield , and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress .

to perform the comparative genomics analysis, we sequenced the whole genome of dxwr using next-generation sequencing  technologies. in this study, the strategy of the comparative genomics analysis was to directly compare the dxwr ngs reads with the nipponbare complete genome without assembly of the dxwr genome. this strategy avoided the highly time-consuming work and a substantial number of errors resulted from the de novo assembly of the dxwr genome using the ngs short reads. the essential work in this comparative strategy was using the software svdetect and the pipeline svfilter to detect structure variations , which are being increasingly appreciated for their roles as a cause for phenotypic variations . using the detected deletions , we located genes which could have been acquired by nipponbare during rice domestication. to overcome the limit of the sv detection, the dxwr transcriptome was also sequenced and compared with the nipponbare transcriptome to discover the genes which could have been lost in dxwr during domestication. both nipponbare-acquired genes and dxwr-lost transcripts were further analyzed using annotations from multiple sources  to reach two research goals: 1) to help better understanding the domestication from wild rice to cultivated rice at the whole genome level; 2) to provide a genomic data resource for rice genetic research or breeding.

RESULTS
whole-genome sequencing of dongxiang wild rice
the sequencing of the dongxiang wild rice  genome produced a total of  <dig> , <dig> paired-end 90 bp cleaned reads  using illumina sequencing technology, covering 68-fold of the reference genome  with the size  <dig> ,519 bp. the high depth of this next-generation sequencing  data satisfied the requirement for the reliable detection of structure variations . then, we mapped all the cleaned reads to nine complete rice genomes . using single-end alignment of forward-sequenced reads, the rate of mapped reads against the total reads reached  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % for o. sativa l. spp. japonica var. nipponbare, o. sativa l. spp. indica, o. nivara, o. glaberrima, o. barthii, o. glumaepatula, o. meridionalis, o. punctata and o. brachyantha, respectively. nipponbare reached the highest mapped rate probably due to two reasons. the first reason is that o. sativa is considered to have been domesticated from chinese common wild rice  <cit> . the second reason is that the nipponbare genome was sequenced using the clone-by-clone approach with sanger sequencing technology and is ranked as the best assembled and annotated one out of all rice genomes. therefore, we used the nipponbare genome as reference to detect svs.

structural variations between dongxiang wild rice and nipponbare genome
we used the software svdetect to detect svs between dxwr paired-end reads and the nipponbare genome without assembly of the dxwr genome. the basic theory of svdetect is to use priori information from paired-ends such as order, orientation and insert size of pairs  to classify mapped reads into normally and anomalously paired-end reads. removing normally mapped paired-end reads, svdetect uses anomalously mapped paired-end reads to produce svs. since svdetect produces a large number of false positive svs, we developed a pipeline named svfilter to reduce the false positives. svfilter uses five independent programs  to successively filter out false positives . in this study, svdetect produced  <dig>  potential svs and the ratiofilter largely reduced the sv number to  <dig> . then, the gapfilter, snvfilter, coveragefilter and depthfilter narrowed down the sv number to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , respectively.

after removing the larger deletions which overlapped the smaller inside deletions,  <dig> out of  <dig> deletions were left for further analysis. finally,  <dig> svs were determined to include  <dig> deletions,  <dig> translocations,  <dig> inverted translocations,  <dig> inversions, six inverted duplications, three inverted fragment inversions, one fragment insertion and  <dig> undefined svs. among eight types of svs, the deletions contribute to  <dig>  %  of the total svs , followed by translocations/inverted translocations accounting for  <dig>  %  of the total svs . generally speaking, the deletion number and the translocation/inverted translocation number has a linear relationship with the chromosome length on a logarithmic scale, respectively . all chromosomes of the nipponbare genome contain the deletions and translocations/inverted translocations in the same pattern with the exception of chromosome  <dig>  moreover, chromosome  <dig> contains more deletions and translocations/inverted translocations than the other  <dig> chromosomes.fig.  <dig> distribution of deletions and translocations on nipponbare genome. a totally  <dig> deletions were determined between the dongxiang wild rice and nipponbare genome. b totally  <dig> translocations and  <dig> inverted translocations were plotted on  <dig> rice chromosomes using nipponbare as reference

discovery of nipponbare-acquired genes during rice domestication
the sv detection and filtering process determined  <dig> deletions. these deleted regions could contain genes which were hypothesized to have been acquired by nipponbare during rice domestication. mapping the  <dig> deletions to rice genes in the nipponbare genome,  <dig>  %  of the total deletions were associated to  <dig> genes . among  <dig> deletions,  <dig>  %  contain only one gene. the top eight deletions containing more than ten genes were mapped to the genomic region from 10790002 bp to 10920963 bp on chromosome  <dig> , chr9:10545593– <dig>  chr8:9242722– <dig>  chr2:14239399– <dig>  chr6:23563294– <dig>  chr6:29241098– <dig>  chr2:17681691– <dig> and chr11:11280103– <dig> . among  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes,  <dig>  %  are transposable elements ,  <dig>  %  of which are retrotransposons . in the total  <dig>  nipponbare genes,  <dig>  %  are tes,  <dig>  %  of which are retrotransposons. more than two-fold  difference of te percentages is consistent with the previous finding that tes contribute greatly to the genome evolution from wild rice to cultivated rice  <cit> .

quantitative trait loci  link particular regions on the genome to the agronomic traits. in rice, numerous qtls for important agronomic traits have been identified and included in the gramene qtl database . mapping the deletions to the annotated rice qtls in the nipponbare genome,  <dig> qtls located in  <dig> unique regions on the nipponbare genome were associated to  <dig> deletions . the phenotypes of these  <dig> qtls belong to six trait categories. they are yield , vigor , anatomy , quality , biochemical  and development  . combining the results from the previous steps, we constructed the relationship between qtls and genes in the same regions affected by the deletions . finally, the relationship between  <dig> deletions,  <dig> deleted genes and  <dig> qtls was constructed for further studies . using this relationship information, agronomic traits, qtls and associated genes were summarized to help better understanding the domestication from wild rice to cultivated rice. during this domestication process, cultivated rice could have acquired genes involving plant height, spikelet number, panicle number, leaf senescence and panicle length on the top five traits, followed by biomass yield, seedling vigor, leaf width, tiller number and various other traits .table  <dig> qtls for traits and associated genes

discovery of dxwr-lost genes using the dxwr transcriptome
in this study, we only used 500 bp paired-end reads from the dxwr genome for sv detection. this single library size limited the size of detected insertions on the dxwr genome to not more than 300 bp. then, we could not detect large insertions  to locate dxwr-lost genes during rice domestication. therefore, we sequenced and assembled the dxwr transcriptome to discover dxwr-lost genes. the total rna was extracted from seedling leaves and seedling roots to construct two separate rna-seq libraries, which were sequenced on the illumina hiseq  <dig> system. after data cleaning and quality control, a total of  <dig> , <dig> paired-end 100 bp raw reads  were processed to  <dig> , <dig> cleaned reads, with the q <dig> percentage of  <dig>  %. these cleaned reads were de novo assembled into the dxwr transcriptome, filtering out contigs shorter than 200 bp.

the dxwr transcriptome contains  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  transcripts with the average length 968 bp and the n <dig> length 1655 bp, while the nipponbare transcriptome contains  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  transcripts with the average length 1722 bp and the n <dig> length 2295 bp, filtering out the transcripts shorter than 200 bp. the length distribution of the assembled dxwr transcriptome was compared with the length distribution of the nipponbare transcriptome . from fig. 3a, it can be seen the number of dxwr and nipponbare transcripts decreases with the transcript length in a similar pattern, with an exception of transcripts shorter than 1000 bp. particularly, dxwr has more short transcripts  than nipponbare does. this difference is mainly due to the incomplete assembly of these dxwr transcripts using the ngs short reads. although  <dig>   dxwr transcripts have lengths less than 500 bp,  <dig>   transcripts with lengths at least 500 bp still provide abundant information for further studies. in addition, nipponbare has more high-gc transcripts than dxwr does . the previous study indicated that high-gc genes in rice and other cereals have greater bias and codon usage is skewed toward codons that are preferred in highly expressed genes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> dongxiang wild rice and nipponbare transcriptome. dongxiang and nipponbare represents the dongxiang wild rice and nipponbare transcripts longer than 200 bp. the dongxiang transcriptome could contain transcripts from chloroplast or mitochondria. a length distribution. b gc-content distribution



using the program blastx,  <dig>   transcripts were annotated by the functional description of their top  <dig> similar sequences , if they existed, from the ncbi non-redundant protein  database . using the software blast2go,  <dig>   transcripts were annotated by gene ontology  slim terms for plants in three domains, molecular function, cellular component and biological process. by mapping go slim terms to enzyme codes and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database,  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . using the program blastn,  <dig>  dxwr transcripts were mapped to the nipponbare transcriptome and then,  <dig> unmapped transcripts were mapped to the nipponbare mitochondrial cdna, chloroplast cdna and nuclear genome sequences. finally,  <dig> transcripts from  <dig> genes were identified as dxwr-lost transcripts during domestication.

further analysis of nipponbare-acquired and dxwr-lost genes
to further analyze  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes,  <dig> putative proteins encoded by them were mapped to kegg pathways, known transcription factors  and protein kinases , respectively. the significant results included  <dig> genes involving the photosynthesis pathway ,  <dig> genes involving the oxidative phosphorylation pathway , three putative proteins encoded by two genes  belonging to the transcription factor mikc, three putative proteins encoded by three genes  belonging to the wall associated kinase  or wall associated kinase-like kinase family, seven putative proteins encoded by the gene loc_os01g <dig> belonging to the receptor like cytoplasmic kinase viii family and five putative proteins encoded by the gene loc_os01g <dig> belonging to the cdc <dig> like kinase family. further analysis showed  <dig> of  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes have only one copy in the genome. these  <dig> genes encode proteins from hnh endonuclease family, trehalose phosphatase, myb family transcription factor, ubiquitin-protein ligase  <dig> and peptide transporter ptr <dig>  et al. . further analysis of  <dig> dxwr-lost transcripts showed  <dig> of them had functional annotations and three of them were enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. these three transcripts encode three proteins, which are cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase subunit i and nad-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase .fig.  <dig> the photosynthesis pathway with nipponbare-acquired genes. this figure  was downloaded from the kegg website with copy-right permission. among  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes,  <dig> photosynthesis related genes were mapped to six proteins . they are photosystem ii psba, photosystem ii psbe, photosystem ii psbk, photosystem ii psbz, photosystem i psac and f-type atpase beta

mikc as one type of mads-box tfs has been implicated in several aspects of plant growth and development. genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> mads-box genes in rice showed: 1) the nipponbare-acquired gene loc_os08g <dig>  and loc_os12g <dig>  was categorized into the agl17-like and the squa-like group, respectively; 2) these two mads-box genes were genetically far from other genes within their groups  <cit> . the wak gene family plays important roles in cell expansion, pathogen resistance and heavy-metal stress tolerance in arabidopsis. the oswak gene family containing  <dig> members expanded in the rice genomes due to lineage-specific expansion of the family in monocots  <cit> . the nipponbare-acquired gene loc_os09g <dig> , loc_os09g <dig>  and loc_os09g <dig>  was classified into the type of oswak-rlck, oswak pseudogene and oswak-rlp  <cit> , respectively.

in total,  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes were enriched in the photosynthesis pathway,  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes and three dxwr-lost transcripts were enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway . both photophosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation are potential atp sources for the plasmalemma atpase, which drives the phosphorylation reaction to releases energy. previous studies showed these two energy systems cooperate to provide energy. one example is mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation appears to serve an essential function for supplying the cytosol with atp during photosynthesis  <cit> . another example is photophosphorylation in the light and oxidative phosphorylation in the dark supply energy together for the opening of stomata on the epidermal peels of commelina communis l. and vicia faba l.  <cit> . previous studies also showed that cultivated rice possesses higher photosynthetic efficiency than wild rice does to produce high yield  <cit> . these findings together suggest the photophosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation system in rice could have adapted to environmental changes simultaneously during domestication from wild rice to cultivated rice.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed the whole genome sequencing of dongxiang wild rice , a chinese common wild rice. using the software svdetect and the pipeline svfilter,  <dig> structural variations  were determined between dxwr and the reference genome nipponbare. out of  <dig> svs,  <dig> deletions were used to locate  <dig> deleted genes, which were hypothesized to have been acquired by nipponbare during its domestication. to overcome the dna library size limit, the dxwr transcriptome was sequenced and compared with the nipponbare transcriptome to obtain  <dig> dxwr-lost transcripts during rice domestication. further analysis of nipponbare-acquired genes and dxwr-lost transcripts showed  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes were enriched in the photosynthesis pathway. in addition,  <dig> nipponbare-acquired genes and three dxwr-lost transcripts were enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. the photophosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation system in rice could have adapted to environmental changes simultaneously during domestication from wild rice to cultivated rice.

in this study, the relationship between  <dig> deletions,  <dig> deleted genes and  <dig> qtls was constructed to provide a valuable resource for further studies. using this relationship information, agronomic traits, qtls and associated genes were summarized to help better understand the substantially phenotypic and physiological changes from wild rice to cultivated rice at the whole genome level. this information can also be used to guide the future experiments for rice genetic research or breeding.
