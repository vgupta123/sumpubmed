BACKGROUND
dentin, one of the major mineralized tissues of teeth, is deposited by odontoblasts, which synthesize collagenous and non-collagenous proteins   <cit> . among the ncps, there is a family of small integrin-binding ligand n-linked glycoproteins  consisting of dentin matrix protein  <dig> , dentin sialophosphoprotein , integrin-binding sialoprotein , matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein  and osteopontin   <cit> . these genes share common genetic and structural features, including a small non-translational first exon, a start codon in the second exon and a large coding segment in the last exon   <cit> . the entire sibling protein family likely arose from the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein  family by gene duplication, since this cluster of genes encodes proteins with similar molecular-structural features and functions  <cit> .

members of this gene family are encoded by a compact tandem gene cluster  characterized by:  common exon-intron features,  the presence of the integrin-binding tripeptide arg-gly-asp  motif that mediates cell attachment/signaling via interaction with cell surface integrins  <cit> , and  post-translational modifications of conserved phosphorylation and n-glycosylation sites  <cit> . in humans, the mepe protein  is encoded by four exons with a  <dig> bp transcript with two n-glycosylation motifs , a glycosaminoglycan  attachment site at residues 256- <dig>  and the rgd cell attachment motif at residues 247- <dig>  <cit> . the rgd motif has a similar function in other members of the sibling's   <cit> . the protein mepe has several predicted phosphorylation sites/motifs for protein kinase c, casein kinase ii, tyrosine kinase, and camp-cgmp-dependent protein kinase and a large number of n-myristoylation sites that appear to be also a feature of the rgd-containing proteins  <cit> . the acidic serine-aspartate-rich mepe-associated motif  occurs at the c-terminus in mepe   <cit>  and when phosphorylated this small peptide can bind to hydroxyapatite and inhibit mineralization  <cit> .

the basic mepe protein was first cloned from a tumor resected from a patient with tumor-induced osteomalacia   <cit> , which is associated with hypophosphatemia and is caused by a renal phosphate wasting. the mepe gene is also up-regulated in x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets  and oho-tumors  <cit> . under normal conditions it is expressed primarily in osteoblasts, osteocytes, and odontoblasts  <cit> .

targeted disruption of the mepe gene in mouse causes increased bone formation and bone mass, suggesting that mepe plays an inhibitory role in bone formation and mineralization  <cit> . in humans, mepe inhibits mineralization and is also involved in renal phosphate regulation  <cit> . the inhibition of mineralization and phosphate uptake are related with the protease resistant small peptide asarm motif located near the end of the protein  <cit> . however, the mepe protein has dual functions depending on the proteolytic processing. when the protein is cleaved by cathepsin b or d into several fragments, the small peptide asarm is released  <cit>  and when phosphorylated, this small peptide can bind the hydroxyapatite crystal and inhibit mineralization  <cit> . by contrast, when fragments containing the rgd motif are released and the asarm is not degraded by proteases, mineralization is accelerated  <cit> . the influence of mepe-asarm peptides in the modulation of mineralization is due to a protein-protein interaction with phex, an x-linked phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog   <cit> . phex is also expressed in osteoblasts, osteocytes and odontoblasts and the protein interacts with mepe, protecting it from the proteolytic process  and preventing asarm from being released into blood circulation  <cit> . most of the disorders associated with mepe result from a malfunction of this phex-mepe interaction, which in turn leads to an increase of asarm blood levels.

the majority of mammalian genes are strongly conserved in the coding sequence  <cit> . genes carrying signatures of selection may be involved in adaptation and functional innovation, and often have elevated ratios of nonsynonymous/synonymous nucleotide substitutions  in their coding regions  <cit> . however, evolutionary rates of nuclear and mitochondrial genes are not equal in all the mammalian lineages  <cit> . for example, while rodents tend to accumulate more mutations in nuclear genes than humans  <cit> , the differences between the rates in the two lineages seems to be smaller than the generation time difference  <cit> .

since mepe protein has an important role in the regulation of the skeleton mineralization process and since the mineralized tissue is a critical innovation in vertebrate evolution, the evolutionary study of this developmental gene could provide valuable insights on the adaptive diversification of morphological phenotypes in mammals. as the mepe gene has been suggested to be under selection  <cit> , our objective was to undergo a thorough analysis to evaluate signatures of positive selection using both a gene-level and protein-level approaches. we assessed the evolution of the mepe protein-coding gene in  <dig> mammalian species, from hyracoidea to primates, showing that while four regions/motifs in the mepe gene have a high degree of conservation, the majority of the coding region has a fast evolutionary rate, especially in rodents and tree shrews. indeed, evidence of strong positive selection  was found in  <dig> amino acids that encompass mepe protein, highlighting the role of molecular adaptation in the functionality of this gene.

RESULTS
presence of the mepe in vertebrates
twenty-six mammalian mepe sequences were retrieved from the genbank and ensembl databases, comprising eight different mammalian orders . in addition, sequences of the putative mepe orthologue, ovocleidin- <dig>  were obtained from the available bird genome projects  for comparative purposes. for the majority of the mammals considered in this work, the mepe gene encompasses four exons that encode a transcript that varied from  <dig> bp in ochotona princeps to  <dig> bp in pan troglodytes. some of the smallest reported transcripts may be incomplete, as in the case of o. princeps, which is missing a stop codon. the absence of the asarm motif in the mepe's c-terminal in some species  also suggests that those genes were not fully annotated. thus, we performed a detailed search in databases for those species using tblastn  <cit> , which led to the identification of the asarm in e. caballus, but not in o. princeps, o. garnetti and p. vampyrus . however, several stop codons are present between the end of the present sequence and the putative asarm motif in the e. caballus sequence and therefore it was not included in subsequent analyses.

we performed blast searches  to determine if mepe is present in non-mammalian or non-avian vertebrates , but we were not able to detect an orthologue in those lineages, suggesting that this gene may be considerably differentiated or even absent. in chicken , a similar protein has been already described, mepe/oc <dig>  <cit>  , and it is likely a homologue of mepe. this orthologue is also present in two other birds . although our initial blast searches did not return a significant hit in reptiles, a recent study suggests the presence of mepe in anolis carolinensis  <cit> . blast searches for the mepe gene in teleost fishes  did not retrieve a significant hit. even searching synteny blocks between human and zebrafish , did not provide evidence of mepe. this result is concordant with previous studies  <cit>  that show the likely presence of two genes belonging to the sibling family in teleost fishes but not a mepe orthologue. mammals and reptiles are the only tetrapod lineages with all five sibling family genes , as previously suggested  <cit> .

sequence analyses
at the protein level mepe is highly variable, especially in the region encoding the last exon, with pairwise amino acid similarity among mammals varying from 99% to 28%. nevertheless, four important regions within mepe had high amino acid conservation : the signal peptide, the rgd and sgdg regions , and the asarm motif . moreover, the protein is also highly conserved from positions  <dig> to  <dig> bp of the human sequence, a region associated with a putative regulatory region . exon  <dig>  only  <dig> bp long, encodes mainly the signal peptide and is highly conserved. remarkably, two alanines  are conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> mammalian species studied . the fourth exon  comprehends the rgd, sgdg, and asarm motifs and the putative regulatory region. gc content was similar along most of the coding sequences, with a few segments above 50% .

phylogenetic analyses of the mammalian mepe protein sequences showed similar overall topologies with the three reconstruction methods used: neighbor-joining , bayesian , and maximum likelihood  . the topologies were also consistent with those retrieved when using the mepe nucleotide sequences , and all were mostly compatible with the accepted phylogeny of mammals  <cit> . however, rodentia and scandentia had long branches, suggesting higher mutation rates . we performed the two-sided kishino-hasegawa test , the shimodaira-hasegawa test , and the expected likelihood weights  in tree-puzzle to determine the best-fitting tree. the test of the three resulting phylogenetic trees suggests that the ml tree best fit the multiple sequence alignment , although the bayesian tree was not significantly worse than the ml tree . conversely, after removing the rodents and tree shrew the three methods produced similar topologies and therefore no significant differences were obtained in the tests implemented in tree-puzzle. the best-fitting trees for the two alignments were then used in subsequent analyses. likelihood mapping, implemented in tree-puzzle to inspect the phylogenetic signal of the alignment , showed a relevant value for both alignments that was slightly reduced when rodents and tree shrew were included. phylogenies based only on transversions or only on the first and the second coding positions showed the same patterns .

in the non-coding gene regions, the nucleotide similarity plots illustrate that the human sequence is highly conserved relative to the other primates, pan troglodytes, gorilla gorilla and macaca mulatta . at a lower level the comparison of the mepe non-coding regions across all species showed several conserved non coding sequences  after pairwise comparisons with the human sequence across all species. this intronic conservation is particularly important since cns have been associated with transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the length of cns decreases when the human mepe is compared with homologues from more distantly related species, but not necessarily in a direct association with phylogenetic distance . for instance, the dog  and cattle  are phylogenetically more distant from human than the mouse  and rat , but showed a higher conservation both in coding and non-coding regions of the gene . by contrast, in the order lagomorpha there is less conservation in the intronic regions but high conservation in the coding regions, and in rodents, there are high numbers of differences both in coding and non-coding regions . as expected, birds showed low similarity in both coding and non-coding region with mammals , although they exhibited high similarity in the coding regions in pairwise comparisons with g. gallus . furthermore, the two galliform species also were similar in the non-coding regions while the g. gallus and the t. guttata did not present high intronic conservation.

given the large difference in average length of cns  and their high similarity  , it is not surprising that introns have ample phylogenetic signal for gene-tree reconstruction. the alignment of the intronic regions comprehends  <dig> bp and  <dig> of those sites were clean of ambiguity data in all the species . mepe intronic sequences provided a significant phylogenetic signal across all the studied mammals, resulting in similar topologies as those trees reconstructed from coding regions and protein suggesting an appreciable level of evolutionary constraints in mepe introns .

the mepe protein is generally basic, with an average isoelectric point  of  <dig>  in the mammal species studied. generally the pi was lower in laurasiatheria, reaching  <dig>  in felis catus . in the three available avian sequences pi was less than  <dig> in the two galliformes and slightly above  <dig> in passeriformes. these differences in pi may have dramatic effects on the protein folding, as those changes are caused by significant differences in the polarity of the amino acids that compose the protein.

functional motifs
the cell attachment region, rgd, situated near the center of the mepe protein, is fully conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> mammalian species . however, some changes are observed in tursiops truncatus, procavia capensis, the bats pteropus vampyrus and myotis lucifugus, and in the rodents dipodomys ordii and spermophilus tridecemlineatus  and it is likely that such amino acids changes in the rgd motif may have functional relevance. moreover, the rgd motif is also present in other genes of this gene-cluster family.

the sdgd is completely conserved among all the mammals, reinforcing the premise that this peptide region is, along with rgd, important to the mepe function. these two motifs constitute the dentonin region, which was not detected in any of the others members of the sibling protein family. the chicken and the turkey mepe orthologues appear to be exceptions, since they do not have the cell-adhesion motif, rgd, but contain the glycosaminoglycan-binding motif, sgdg. in these species we found a hgd near the sgdg motif, suggesting that rgd is replaced by hgd . a similar change from rgd has been described in other members of the dspp orthologues   <cit> . nevertheless, in zebra finch  we found the rgd motif but not the sgdg region . the asarm motif is highly conserved within the  <dig> mammals for which asarm is annotated , although the bottlenose dolphin  has a similarity of only  <dig> %. pairwise similarity among birds was  <dig> % , but on average only  <dig> % similarity was observed between birds and the mammalian asarm. moreover, in birds this motif is capped at the c-terminal by  <dig>  to  <dig>  amino acids, and this region shows  <dig> % similarity between g. gallus and m. gallopavo but less than 40% between these two species and t. guttata, showing that this region in birds is probably less constrained than the asarm.

rodentia and scandentia selection signatures
the saturation plots  showed that the rodents and the tree shrew have accumulated a very high number of transitions and transversions relative to other mammalian species . saturation of synonymous mutations can bias the analysis of positive selection due to an underestimation of ds that will increase ω  <cit> . therefore, these species have been excluded from the codon and amino acid properties selection analyses . when we grouped rodents and the tree shrew, and compared them with the other mammals, the relative ratio test   <cit>  showed that mepe accumulated more mutations in the orders rodentia and scandentia , with an average number of synonymous substitutions of  <dig>  and non-synonymous substitutions of  <dig> , in contrast with the other mammalian species with  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the tree shrew and the rodents compared with the others mammals, had a higher gc percentage . this shows that rodentia and scandentia have accumulated more synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions , which is consistent with the phylogenetic analyses that suggest that the rodents and the tree shrew have an accelerated rate of evolution.

to evaluate if orders rodentia and scandentia have different sites under positive selection we compared the branch-site model a using the rodents  and tree shrew  as the foreground branch versus the other mammals as background branch . the rodents had  <dig> sites under positive selection, with four of these being highly significant  after the bayes empirical bayes  analysis; 42-tyr, 158-lys, 239-gly, 247-asp . the likelihood ratio test  demonstrated that the branch-site analysis was statistically significant . sliding window analysis using the nei-gojobori method also presented significant differences in the sites/regions under positive selection between the rodents/tree shrew and the other mammals . when we applied a window =  <dig> and step =  <dig>  the rodents and the tree shrew showed eight regions with a dn/ds >  <dig>  while the others species had only two regions >  <dig>  suggesting that the rodents not only present an accelerated rate of evolution but also exhibited a different selection pattern in the protein .

selection signatures at the codon level
the codeml test implemented in paml was used to compare five different nested models in two situations, i.e. including or excluding the ambiguity data in the alignment. the mepe protein had a global dn/ds ratio of  <dig> , with  <dig> sites under negative selection and  <dig> sites under positive selection . when ambiguous data was removed the lrt's for the nested models, m1-m <dig>  was rejected , so the results of positive selection for m <dig> were not taken into account. in the lrt comparison between the more parameter-rich nested pairs of models , twice the log-likelihood difference was  <dig> , rejecting m <dig> and favoring m <dig> . under m <dig>  87% of the sites fit the β distribution , but 13% of the sites had a ω <dig> =  <dig> . for posterior probabilities of ω >  <dig> using beb with m <dig> vs. m <dig>  nine sites were under positive selection . however, none of these sites passed the stringent criterion of statistical significance pp >  <dig>  . additionally, the lrt between the m <dig> and the alternative null model m8a was  <dig> , below the critical value , and therefore not favoring the evolutionary model. however, it has been shown that in some cases this alternative lrt test has less power when the category of positively selected sites has a ω value that is only slightly larger than one  <cit> .

the evaluation of positive selection using the model implemented in single likelihood ancestor counting  showed three sites under selection, one of those sites being similar to that retrieved with model m <dig> in paml. since slac tends to be quite conservative, we also estimated the selection signatures using the fixed effects likelihood  model, which is assumed to be more powerful than slac  <cit> . the fel model revealed a total of  <dig> sites under selection using this model, including a mutation in the highly conserved small peptide asarm  . such a radical change in asarm was only observed in a few species and further studies are needed to better document its frequency across mammals. all the sites presented in the model implemented in datamonkey have a significance value  in fel and slac, which is an accepted level of significance for the test of those models  <cit> . when we use a significance threshold of  <dig> , the number of positive selected amino acids decreased to  <dig> in fel and zero in slac, meaning that  <dig> sites  had less evidence of being under strong positive selection. however, these positions may still be indicative of selection signatures. recombination can affect several analyses, including phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis of positive selection  <cit> . therefore, we assessed gene recombination using gard implemented in the datamonkey web-based server  <cit>  and repeated the selection analysis including and excluding recombination in the dataset. partitioning the data did not change the conclusions of the positive selection analyses , suggesting that recombination is not significantly affecting the mepe gene evolution.

no additional sites were found using the slr  <cit> , but six sites under selection in the previous analysis were also statistically supported. overall, across mepe,  <dig> of the  <dig> sites  were under positive selection; additionally six sites were supported by more than one codon analysis  .

selection at the amino acid level
selection models that use dn/ds ratios to detect selection are generally not sensitive enough to detect subtle molecular adaptations  <cit> . it is therefore necessary to employ alternative criteria within generally conserved protein-coding genes or within proteins with strict motifs intermixed with regions under fast directional evolution. therefore, we used treesaap  <cit> , which evaluates destabilizing radical changes at each site, and an empirical threshold of change in three properties was applied as evidence that a site is under positive  selection.

at the global protein level, eight of  <dig> amino acids properties were under strong positive selection in mepe  . remarkably, pi is one of these eight properties under positive selection in mepe which may also explain the high variability in pi observed across taxa .

list of properties under selection, the impact category and the level of significance .

at the amino acid site level, mepe has  <dig> sites  under positive selection in at least one property. although applying the empirical threshold of at least three properties showing signatures of positive selection the number of sites is reduced to  <dig>  . the majority of these  <dig> sites are located in the n-terminal region of the protein and the dentonin region . the alternative calculation method was performed using contest and estimates of variation in amino acid charge and volume revealed  <dig> sites with signatures of positive selection for at least one of the amino acid properties . however, after the bonferroni and false discovery rate  correction, only one site showed positive selection. this site, located at position  <dig> in the alignment , corresponds either to lysine or glutamate and was not detected by treesaap. the ancestral protein reconstruction in treesaap, based on the baseml implemented in paml, shows that glutamate is present in the common ancestor of non-afrotheria mammals, suggesting that the radical change to lysine occurred in cetartiodactyla, perissodactyla and in at least one representative of the lagomorpha.

based on selection analyses at the protein level across mepe,  <dig> of the  <dig> sites  were under selection at the amino acid level .

selection at codon and amino acid level
we found  <dig> sites with signatures of positive selection, but there was concordance between codon and amino acid level methods for only  <dig> of these . more conservatively, the number of sites dropped to five if the most stringent and conservative criterion was used .

directed evolution analysis 
mepe evolution has disproportionally accumulated serines, threonines , arginines, alanines and valines, as all these amino acids showed directional evolution in the deps analysis  . the mepe protein had  <dig> sites under directional selection , seven of which are amino acids that tend to increase the disorder/unstructured probability of the regions. additionally, eight of these  <dig> sites had a tendency to change to amino acids that are potentially phosphorylated residues, particularly at positions  <dig> and  <dig> , since these sites are relatively near the asarm motif and the cleavage site by cathepsin-b.

selection signatures and the mepe structure
the mepe protein belongs to a category of proteins classified as "intrinsically unstructured/natively disordered", with  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the human and the mouse mepe constituted by amino acids that are associated with disorder/unstructured regions, respectively. this is reinforced given that most of the protein  is disordered at a  <dig> % false positive rate. interestingly, the asarm motif has a high content of amino acids disorder promoters while the other functional motifs  incorporate regions that are structured . the protein has a high percentage of the amino acid aspartate, which characterizes the proteins of the sibling family. given the importance of disorder/order in mepe, we analyzed the implications of selection signatures relative to the protein structural differences, and found that sites 75-ser, 127-glu, and 481-arg  are under positive selection and have a higher number of non-synonymous mutations towards codons that encode the amino acids disorder promoters.

the tertiary structure is similar to another extracellular matrix protein, anosnim- <dig>  with a root mean square deviation  of  <dig> . to determine if the spatial organization of these sites is associated with regions of functional importance, we plotted the positively selected sites  in the tertiary structure . the sites showing selection signatures in both analyses are not restricted to any nature of the secondary structure  although most of the sites are located in random coils. in human mepe,  <dig> % of the amino acids are predicted to be found within random coils, but when this analysis is restricted to the  <dig> sites under positive selection  the percentage increases to 71%. of the  <dig> sites under selection  the percentage increases to 75%. this shows that the sites comprehending the random coils tend to have higher chances of being under selection. similarly, the sites under positive selection tend to be in disordered regions, as  <dig> % of the mepe protein was "intrinsic disordered". of sites under selection in both analyses , 90% were in disordered regions compared with 80% when considering all the sites under selection in at least one of the analyses. from the  <dig> sites under strong positive selection ,  <dig> were solvent accessible, four were buried and the remaining six were in an intermediate category of neither buried nor exposed . estimates of protein stability revealed  <dig> sites of human mepe with sequence optimality values  less than - <dig> kcal/mol at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  while none of those sites correspond to a site with a signature of positive selection, when the Γ empirical cut-off is reduced to - <dig> kcal/mol the number of sites with a non-optimal state increases to  <dig>  of these, three sites are under positive selection based on both codon and amino acid analyses, and  <dig> of these sites show evidence of being under positive selection at either the codon or amino acid level.

discussion
mepe in the tetrapods
given the absence of the mepe gene in fishes and amphibians, its origin likely coincides with the divergence of amniotes, when mineralization  <cit>  and phosphate regulation  <cit>  had a crucial role in species survival and diversification. spp <dig> diverged from sparcl <dig>  and both are expressed in bone, participating in the bone formation   <cit> . therefore, the presence of spp <dig> in fishes with a broader tissue expression pattern  <cit>  suggests that spp <dig> might also have similar functions to mepe. remarkably, after duplication, the genes were conserved during evolution and probably have differentiated to assume various functions related with tissue mineralization specificity. recently, it was proposed that spp <dig> is a more-powerful inhibitor of mineralization than mepe  <cit> . this suggests that after the emergence of the complete sibling family in vertebrates, some functions were possibly shared among genes, notably because mepe is absent in fishes.

the mepe gene has similarities with other sibling genes, suggesting that it originated through a duplication event from another member of the gene family  <cit> , but different dynamics of gene duplication and gene loss have occurred among lineages . the five genes of the sibling family are present in therian mammals and reptiles, but birds only have four genes , while fish only have two genes . the dspp orthology in fishes is controversial  <cit> . however, despite the low similarity, dspp starmaker was identified as a functional orthologue  <cit>  clearly associated with dspp  <cit> . the presence/absence of various sibling family genes in vertebrates suggests that despite the crucial role of mepe in mammals, birds and reptiles, its function may have been compensated in other taxa by other genes of the family. for example, in fishes a duplicated copy of spp <dig> has not been described, suggesting that the fish spp <dig> orthologue may have had a similar function to mepe since spp <dig> and mepe, interact with phex  <cit> . the release of the asarm from the mepe protein and the phosphorylation of this motif lead to an inhibition of mineralization  <cit> . similarly, the asarm from spp <dig> inhibit the mineralization  <cit> . moreover, the asarm from spp <dig> is potentially phosphorylated and can interact with the hydroxyapatite crystals leading to a negative regulation of mineralization  <cit> . although spp <dig> has an asarm motif near the center of the molecule, it does not have the full dentonin region . moreover, the spp1-asarm has been described as a more-potent mineralization inhibitor than the mepe-asarm  <cit> . however, the knockouts of spp <dig> and mepe in mice have different phenotypes. mepe knockouts have increased bone mass and inhibition of age-related bone loss  <cit>  while spp <dig> knockouts cause a resistance to bone loss and trabecular bone mass  <cit> .

functional conservation
the functional motifs of mepe  are highly conserved among the studied mammals. in the sibling proteins the first coding exon encodes the signal peptides  <cit> , as is observed in mepe. the rgd motif is a common feature of all member of the sibling family, remaining functionally preserved after the tandem duplication that gave rise to all the members of this gene family  <cit> . surprisingly, birds do not have a complete dentonin region , although the high conservation observed among mammals suggests that this region has an important role in the function of the protein. in fact, in mammals the gene function apparently depends on the full dentonin region, as the rgd motif alone does not enhance an optimal adhesion on biomaterial surfaces in osteoblast  <cit> . however, when sgdg is close to rgd the mitogenic activity of dentonin increases, while the presence of only the sgdg motif promotes the cell proliferation  <cit> . in mammals, mepe is involved in bone formation and osteoblast proliferation  <cit> , while in birds it is involved in egg-shell formation  <cit> . this functional divergence may explain the sequence differences observed between the two lineages, particularly reinforced by the absence of the full dentonin region in birds. the asarm motif is also highly conserved among mammals, but shares less than 50% similarity with the avian asarm. moreover, we have not detected a similar cathepsin-b cleavage site near avian mepe-asarm and this motif is capped at the c-terminal by  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. amino acids towards the c-terminal after the asarm motif are also observed in marsupials  <cit> . despite the lower similarity with the mammalian asarm and its different position, the high conservation within birds suggests that this motif continues to have a crucial role. the changes are probably not due a relaxation of selection, but instead may have an adaptive role. in mammals, the cathepsin-b cleavage site is crucial for the function of mepe, since this small peptide only interferes with hydroxyapaptite crystals when released  <cit> . therefore, birds are also expected to have a mechanism for cleavage of asarm. mepe has not yet been annotated in a monotremata, no significant matches were found in a representative species of this group, the platypus . nevertheless, the discovery of this gene in egg-laying mammals would be of great relevance to understanding the functional differences between mammals and birds.

the coding region of mepe that flank the motifs described above is less conserved, but retain considerable phylogenetic signal across species. the human mepe sequence has a high similarity with the great apes and with the genus macaca , even in the non-coding regions . to a lesser degree, human mepe also has some significant similarities in the non-coding regions with the genes of the lower primates . mepe appears to be particularly conserved among primates, in both coding and non-coding regions. the intronic conservation could provide valuable information about the role of non-coding sequences in the regulation/functionality of this gene. despite the accelerated evolution in rodents, intronic conservation allowed us to reconstruct a well-supported species phylogeny from intronic sequences  with similar results as those obtained from mepe coding regions.

several human diseases increase mepe expression  <cit> , which may imply functional constraints in the gene even at the intronic level. previous studies have demonstrated that highly conserved intronic regions are correlated with functional constraints and can be evidence of a hidden class of abundant regulatory elements  <cit> . recently, a snp in the region  <dig> kb 3' of the gene was associated with osteoporosis, a disease characterized by reduced bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue that reduces bone strength and leads to an increased risk of fracture  <cit> . these findings suggest that intergenic regions can also be important in gene function and may cause significantly different phenotypes. we hypothesize that intronic regions can also lead to significant differences at the expression level and ultimately to differences in phenotypes. this is consistent with our findings that there are strong evolutionary constraints in the mepe intronic region.

selection signatures and conservation
within mammals, mepe in rodents is evolving faster, presenting a high amount of transitions and transversions. a similar trend is also observed in the tree shrew t. belangeri. however, since we only had one mepe sequence from the order scandentia we were unable to infer if this pattern is species-specific or if it is typical of this order. the increased number of substitutions in rodents was expected as previous studies have shown that rodents tend to accumulate more mutations in the coding regions  <cit> . we hypothesize that the observed differences in these two orders have resulted from either a divergent functional role or simply a relaxation in darwinian selection. it is not known if the function of the rodent mepe is similar to that in humans  <cit> , but all the functional motifs are conserved and the signatures of positive selection or the differences observed were only detected outside of these important motifs. it is clear that positive selection may have an important role in the functional divergence of homologous proteins during adaptation to different habitats  <cit> . indeed, selection may be episodic as positive and negative selection shifts over time across different lineages, reinforcing the importance of comparing sequences that have diverged within appropriate time frames  <cit> . the branch-site model, using rodents as foreground branches and allowing ω ratio variation not only between the branches but also among sites, identified  <dig> sites with strong signatures of positive selection. this suggests that the rodents and probably scandentia may have lineage-specific selection differences in mepe, not only in the magnitude of the selective pressure found in the branch, but also in the number of sites under selection. the acceleration of the substitution rates in rodents and the tree shrew potentially compromises the assessment of positive selection by increasing the number of synonymous mutations and because this heterogeneous site selection is observed in only two of the eight orders evaluated . the results may also be biased by the mixing of species with long and short generation times  <cit> , as well as the related long-branch-attraction effect in phylogenetic reconstruction. therefore, we did not include the rodents and the tree shrew in the site analysis.

the evolutionary analyses of mammalian mepe codons  found  <dig> sites under positive selection at codon level, and remarkably three were in functional regions of the protein, positions 6-val and 11-phe  and position 517-gly  .

recent methods for investigating selection in protein coding genes have focused on evaluating the type of positive selection detected , determining the presence of purifying selection, and interpreting how selection affects overall protein structure and function. amino acid substitutions have different effects on a protein depending on differences in physicochemical properties and their position in the protein structure  <cit> . here, we performed multiple analyses to differentiate among the different types of selective pressures acting in mepe at the amino acid level. the evaluation of the amino acid physiochemical properties changes in the mammalian mepe identified  <dig> more sites  with selection signatures compared with the results retrieved using codon models. this shows that total reliance on models based on dn/ds using codon models may not detect some important sites with signatures of selection, often because a single adaptive mutation may occur in a small number of species, resulting in an omega lower than one. by contrast, these could also primarily be amino acid stabilizing rather than destabilizing changes, and a ω >  <dig> may not always be indicative of adaptive evolution.

combining all the selection analyses, we found  <dig> amino acids with evidence of positive selection  . three clusters of positively selected sites revealed three new motifs that likely have a functional role, seasen , lnxexs  and ent  , using the human protein as site reference.

selection analysis of mepe in treesaap using amino acid destabilizing properties revealed that the structural properties tend to be more affected by positive selection than the chemical properties. this suggests that the flexible and intrinsically unstructured nature of mepe is linked to its multiple biological roles. the asarm motif shows a "high tendency" to be a "disordered region and highly acidic", although the conformation of asarm should be dependent on the phosphorylation level  <cit> . the ability to bind to hidroxyapatite is also correlated with phosphorylation state and phex cleavage of mepe is dependent on the serine phosphorylation status  <cit> . moreover, our results shows that the protein tends to accumulate numerous residues with potential phosphorylation sites and this can be important to the folding/function of the protein. proteins fold to minimize their free energy, although the structure also reflects an organization that can allow the recognition of a ligand or a transition state  <cit> . in fact, there is a balance between protein function and stability, and most of functional sites are non-optimal in terms of stability. if a residue is replaced by another residue, the protein activity will be reduced but the stability will be increased  <cit> . in mepe we detected  <dig> sites with a Γ lower than - <dig> kcal/mol, indicating that a large number of sites in mepe are non-optimal and therefore possibly involved in protein function. moreover,  <dig> of those sites showed signatures of selection in one analysis, and sites  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in both codon and amino acid level analyses. proteins have different secondary-structures and physicochemical properties and roles that help determine their evolutionary flexibility  <cit> . thus, amino acids that comprise disordered regions, such as random coils, are more likely to be under positive selection than expected from their proportion in the proteins, compared with the residues in helices and β-structures which are subjected to less positive selection  <cit> . indeed, when we compare the evidence of positive selection with the protein secondary structure in mepe we observed that the number of sites under selection in the random coils and disordered regions are slightly higher than expected. this suggests that a high number of sites probably have a functional role or are at least relevant to an increase in mepe protein flexibility.

presently, most of the research on mepe has centered on the biological role of the rgd and asarm regions. however, our comparative study of mammalian mepe orthologues revealed that the protein has lineage-specific properties , and that outside these two well-described motifs there are  <dig> sites  under positive selection and of probable functional relevance. as positively selected sites might be either near catalytically important regions of the proteins  <cit>  or be functionally relevant sites  <cit> , these sites are good candidates for mutagenesis and structural studies to determine the functionality of mepe relative with the other sibling proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
mepe is found in reptiles, birds and mammals , and to date has not been identified in monotremes. the description and study of mepe in other taxonomic groups will be crucial to fully understanding the differences reported in avian and mammalian orthologues, and the adaptive significance of these differences. the absence of this gene in some vertebrate lineages suggests that spp <dig> might partially cover the functions of mepe in those groups. mepe retains a strong phylogenetic signal at both coding and non-coding regions in mammals, probably due to in the functional relevance of these regions. nevertheless, the gene is highly variable, particularly in the largest exon outside the functional motif, while other regions appear to be under strong positive selection. we found  <dig> sites with a significant signature of positive selection at both nucleotide and amino acid level complimentary analyses . the analyses identified three motifs  with selection signatures suggesting important adaptive functions. we also showed that rodentia and scandentia have an accelerated evolutionary rate with a unique evolutionary pattern. finally, we showed that mepe tends to accumulate amino acids that promote "disorder" and that present potential phosphorylation targets, supporting the contention that other regions outside the dentonin and asarm might have crucial functional roles and demonstrating the need for future studies to understand the importance of these regions.
