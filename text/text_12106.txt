BACKGROUND
ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world, but the development of effective therapy has been hampered by the lack of mechanistic insights into the physiological response of the heart to hypoxic stress. adult cardiomyocytes respond to hypoxic stress by reverting to genetic programs associated with embryonic cardiac development, collectively referred to as "the fetal gene program"  <cit> . one of the most critical factors controlling heart growth and development is intrauterine oxygen availability  <cit> . embryonic cardiac development occurs in an environment of low oxygen tension and hypoxia regulates several stress-related pathways affecting cellular proliferation, differentiation and death. while the low oxygen tension at this stage of development is "physiologic", the genes whose expression is modulated by differences in oxygen tension are adapted to the ambient levels of oxygen during this period. recapitulation of this developmental program may be a physiologic adaptation that allows the ischemic heart to respond to hypoxia.

heart cells divide during development and then exit the cell cycle as they undergo terminal differentiation  <cit> . this lack of proliferative capacity poses a challenge for hearts that undergo ischemic injury as they loose cardiac mass and terminal heart failure frequently results. during development, cardiomyocytes proliferate extensively. cells are driven through the cell cycle by a complex of two classes of proteins, cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases . this complex is regulated by two families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors . the ink <dig> family  specifically inhibit cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  while the cip/kip family  inhibit all g1/s cdks  <cit> . the ckis are implicated in cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation in a number of cell types  <cit> . of all the ckis, only p57kip <dig> has been shown to be essential for embryonic development, as p57kip <dig> null mice display significant congenital defects such as cleft palate, omphalocele and short limbs  <cit> . in addition, the p57kip2-/- mice exhibit increased apoptosis in many tissues, including the heart. they typically die in utero or soon after birth due to aspiration and respiratory insufficiency from the cleft palate  <cit> . in the mouse heart, p57kip <dig> message is up-regulated during mid-gestation  <cit> . the p57kip <dig> protein levels peak during late gestation, and then disappear during early fetal life  <cit> . low levels of p57kip <dig> protein are present in the adult human heart, which then increase during terminal heart failure  <cit> . by contrast, there is a concomitant decrease in p21cip <dig> and p27kip <dig> levels  <cit> .

apart from inhibiting the cell cycle, p57kip <dig> has additional roles in the cell. for example, p57kip <dig> modulates stress activated signaling by functioning as an endogenous inhibitor of c-jun kinase , as the qt domain of p57kip <dig> binds and inhibits the jnk/sapk pro-apoptotic activity  <cit> . in addition, p57kip <dig> is up-regulated at early time points of hypoxia  <cit> , indicating it is within the early wave of hypoxia-responsive genes rather than being secondarily induced. previous studies have demonstrated that p21cip <dig> and p27kip <dig> overexpression in cultured rat cardiomyocytes protects the cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis, and this protection appears to be independent of cki activity  <cit> . because p57kip <dig> is differentially regulated from the two other cip/kip family members during hypoxic stress, it is plausible that it possesses similar cardioprotective properties in this setting and compensates for the observed downregulation of p21cip <dig> and p27kip <dig> in the stressed heart  <cit> . the possibility that p57kip <dig> has a previously unrecognized role in cardiac biology related to protection from hypoxic-ischemic injury has not been examined. we hypothesized that p57kip <dig> protects cardiomyocytes under conditions of limited oxygen supply as occurs during embryonic cardiac development and in ischemic injury of the adult heart.

to evaluate this hypothesis, we generated a mouse model  that allows cre-inducible functional expression of p57kip <dig> in a tissue-specific fashion. we used this transgenic model in combination with the mlc2v- crek/+ transgenic mouse to force myocardial specific p57kip <dig> expression in the embryonic and adult heart  <cit>  and we show that myocardial specific expression of p57kip <dig> attenuates hypoxic-ischemic injury in the adult mouse heart. these findings suggest that p57kip <dig> may represent a developmentally regulated protein aiming to protect cardiomyocytes under conditions of limited oxygen supply during development and in pathologic ischemic conditions of adulthood.

RESULTS
cardiac specific overexpression of p57kip <dig> does not affect heart development or cardiomyocyte proliferation
since the p57kip <dig> cdna is preceded by a loxp-flanked strong transcriptional termination sequence , in the absence of cre-recombinase p57kip <dig> transcription is terminated prematurely and the generated transgenic mice  were phenotypically normal as expected. when these mice were crossed with the mlc2v- crek/+ transgenic mice that express cre-recombinase under the transcriptional control of the myosin light chain- <dig> ventricular  promoter, the cre-mediated excision of the floxed termination sequence led to forced expression of p57kip <dig> in ventricular cardiomyocytes. fifty-three double heterozygous animals  from these crosses have been analyzed. the double transgenic mice developed normally and no defects in embryos or adults were observed. litter sizes and fertility were similar to those of control mice and offspring were produced in the expected mendelian ratios . none of the r26loxpta-p57k/+/mlc2v-crek/+ mice were prone to early lethality over  <dig> years of observation suggesting that cardiac specific overexpression of p57kip <dig> is well tolerated from the very early stages of myocardial differentiation. ventricular tissue-specific cre-recombination that allows p57kip <dig> over-expression in cardiomyocytes of the compound heterozygous offspring could be detected by pcr as shown in the diagram .

the r26loxp-tap57k/+;mlc2v-crek/+ genotype is represented in the expected mendelian ratio in the offspring. however, mice with p57kip <dig> cardiac-specific overexpression that are homozygous for the r26p <dig> allele  are significantly under-represented in the offspring 

we examined p57kip <dig> expression by reverse transcriptase  and immunohistochemistry in wild type  or single  transgenic hearts and compared them to the adult double transgenic  hearts. rt-pcr analysis demonstrated the presence of p57kip <dig> message in the adult double transgenic heart, while at the same number of cycles, there was no visible band in the adult wt or single transgenic heart . the average p57kip <dig> expression by quantitative rt-pcr analysis was found to be  <dig>  fold higher in compound transgenic hearts . taking into consideration that only 14–20% of adult mouse ventricular cells are cardiomyocytes and the reported success of recombination is approximately 80% with the mlc2v-cre mouse  <cit> , this result indicates that the cardiomyocytes of the compound transgenic mice express an 8– <dig> fold higher level of p57kip <dig> transcripts above the wild type control animals  <cit> . since there may still be some non-ventricular tissue in this preparation, this number represents a lower estimate of the efficiency of our transgenic system at the mrna level. immunohistochemistry demonstrated that p57kip <dig> is abundantly present in the nuclei of adult cardiomyocytes in the r26loxpta-p57k/+;mlc2v-crek/+ transgenic mice . we did not observe p57kip <dig> expression in the skeletal muscle or in the liver of the double transgenic animals . these results indicate that the transgene is not only specific and effective in overexpressing p57kip <dig> in cardiomyocytes, but also that the cellular capacity for degradation of p57kip <dig> is overcome and not sufficient to reduce the elevated protein levels to normal.

during development, p57kip <dig> gene expression is first observed in the heart of wt mice at e <dig>   <cit> . by e <dig> , p57kip <dig> protein is present in the nuclei of the endocardial cells and in about 75% of the wt cardiomyocytes . in the double transgenic embryos, p57kip <dig> was first detected in cardiomyocyte nuclei at e <dig> , following the expression of mlc2v-cre during early myocardial differentiation  <cit> , indicating that p57kip <dig> expression is directed by the mlc2v promoter .

gross cardiac defects and histological evidence of ventricular thinning, hypertrophy, or fibrosis were absent in adult p57kip <dig> overexpressing hearts. similarly, the ratio of heart weight to body weight  of the transgenic hearts did not significantly differ from that of wild type animals  at  <dig> months of age. there was also no difference in the rate of apoptosis at this age as determined by tunel assay . to assess whether cardiomyocyte-specific p57kip <dig> overexpression affects cardiomyocyte proliferation we performed immunofluorescence experiments with ki- <dig> antibody, a marker for dna synthesis and cell cycling in e <dig> -e <dig>  hearts  <cit> . we did not detect any difference in the number of ki- <dig> positive cardiomyocytes between p57kip <dig> overexpressing transgenic and control animals . these results indicate that p57kip <dig> overexpression does not affect the ability of cardiomyocytes to enter s-phase. interestingly, in some of the cells, p57kip <dig> and ki- <dig> immunoreactivity was present in the same nucleus, although they appeared in mutually exclusive nuclear areas . such cells were found in both transgenic and control animals and therefore cannot be attributed to a transgene effect. this is in accordance with the pattern of p57kip <dig> expression described in trophoblast giant cells, in which brdu and p57kip <dig> co-immunoreactivity could be detected after the cells committed to endoreduplication  <cit> . endoreduplication is a process of repeated rounds of dna synthesis in the absence of mitosis, which occurs in both trophoblast cells and cardiomyocytes and results in the formation of polyploid cells. thus, it is possible that in cardiomyocytes, p57kip <dig> expression and terminal differentiation are not associated with cell cycle exit but rather with endoreduplication.

p57kip <dig> expression in adult cardiomyocytes protects hearts from ischemia/reperfusion injury
after we characterized histologically the adult transgenic mice and demonstrated no differences in  <dig> months of age, we proceeded with the analysis of cardiovascular function. we studied age matched adult mice from the same cohort that covered the adult lifespan from 14– <dig> weeks, when the excitation-coupling mechanisms are known to remain constant  <cit> . to assess the contractile function of p57kip <dig> overexpressing transgenic hearts, we utilized the langendorff isolated perfused mouse heart preparation as previously described  <cit> . after  <dig> minutes of stabilization baseline functional data were obtained and the hearts were then subjected to a protocol of  <dig> minutes global ischemia followed by  <dig> minutes reperfusion. this protocol is based on our experience from previous studies  <cit> . in one of the experiments we assessed the myocardial necrotic area after staining with 10%  <dig> ,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride  and we found that the area of necrotic tissue was reduced  in the double transgenic heart compared with the control . the baseline functional parameters, including left ventricular systolic pressure , left ventricular end diastolic pressure , lvdp/dt, rate pressure product  and heart rate  were not significantly different between the different groups. however, after subjecting the hearts to  <dig> minutes of ischemia, the reperfused p57kip <dig> expressing hearts exhibited significantly better preservation of cardiac function than the wt hearts. more specifically the transgenic hearts demonstrated higher left ventricular developed pressure , rate pressure product  and coronary flow  as assessed at the end of the reperfusion period . the hemodynamic benefits were apparent from the onset of the reperfusion stage and were maintained throughout the  <dig> min period, suggesting that the protective effect of the p57kip <dig> transgene may be manifest during the acute hypoxic phase and not restricted to the reperfusion phase of the injury.

values are means ± se. the two asterisks  indicate statistical significance with a probability of p <  <dig>  , while the one asterisk indicates a probability of p =  <dig> . one-way anova followed by fisher post hoc test also indicated significant difference among these groups. there was also a strong trend for lower lvedp in the transgenic hearts; however with the small number of tested animals this did not reach statistical significance. lvsp, left ventricular systolic pressure; lvedp, left ventricular end diastolic pressure; lvdp, left ventricular developed pressure, hr, heart rate; rpp, rate pressure product; cf, coronary flow.

p57kip2-mediated cardioprotection in the ex vivo ischemia reperfusion injury is associated with modulation of the stress signaling cascade
since p57kip <dig> has been found to physically interact with and inhibit jnk/sapk, we investigated whether the cardioprotective effects of p57kip <dig> were mediated through modulation of the jnk stress signaling pathway. we performed a phospho-proteomic screen that demonstrated wide ranging changes in the stress signaling cascade. these included a 28–34% reduction in phosphorylation of the jnk/sapk epitopes y <dig> and t <dig> from ischemic p57kip <dig> overexpressing hearts compared to similarly ischemic control hearts after normalization to control for inaccuracies in protein determination and sample loading . in addition, phosphorylation changes in other stress signaling molecules not known to be directly related to p57kip <dig> such as αb-crystallin and heat shock protein  <dig> , mek <dig>  marcks, akt <dig>  pkcδ and pkcγ were also found in this screen.

discussion
p57kip <dig> encodes a maternally expressed cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor of the cip/kip family. while loss of function studies on p57kip <dig> have provided important functional clues, herein we report over-expression experiments that provide additional insight into its function. for better understanding of the role of p57kip <dig> in the cardiac tissue, we created a transgenic model that forces expression of p57kip <dig> beyond its narrow temporal window of expression. in our model, p57kip <dig> expression was observed from early gestation  and the tissue-specific pattern persisted into adult life at  <dig>  fold higher levels over the wild type controls. cardiac specific expression of p57kip2beginning at e <dig>  did not appear to be deleterious, as r26loxpta-p57k/+;mlc2v-crek/+ transgenic mice displayed normal cardiac growth both during development and postnatal life. this is in contrast to the observed effects of p57kip <dig> on other tissues, such as kidney and brain, that were shown to be sensitive to an even lower p57kip <dig> dosage change in bac transgenic animals  <cit> . in addition, dna synthesis persisted in the p57kip <dig> over-expressing cardiomyocytes, suggesting that the ability of cardiomyocytes to enter s-phase remained unimpaired. it is likely that sufficient amounts of the necessary cdks are present in the fetal cardiomyocytes to overcome the induced excess of p57kip <dig>  alternatively, excess p57kip <dig> could also have been removed by ubiquitination of the qt domain and degraded via the proteasome pathway  <cit> . however, the widely present p57kip <dig> protein in the fetal and adult cardiomyocytes, beyond the spatial and temporal pattern of endogenous expression, indicates that the cellular capacity for p57kip <dig> degradation was overcome and not sufficient to normalize the elevated protein levels. the concurrent expression of p57kip <dig> in actively proliferating cells is intriguing and suggests that, in cardiomyocytes, p57kip <dig> expression and terminal differentiation are not necessarily associated with cell cycle exit but rather with endoreduplication as in trophoblasts  <cit> .

in our studies, we found that forced expression of p57kip <dig> in the adult heart was associated with a protective effect when the heart undergoes injury by transient ischemia/reperfusion. it seems unlikely that the cell cycle inhibitory function of p57kip <dig> is a factor in this process, as the protective effect was immediate. an alternative explanation to consider is the improved coronary flow in the transgenic hearts. ischemia and reperfusion significantly increase tissue edema in the injured myocardium with secondary compromise of the regional coronary flow  <cit> . since the p57kip <dig> transgene expression is restricted in cardiomyocytes and not present in smooth muscle or endothelial cells, we believe that the preservation of coronary flow is rather secondary to the decreased tissue edema in the transgenic hearts than a primary improvement in coronary vascular flow. instead, it is more plausible that a separate function of p57kip <dig> leads to cardiac protection in the hypoxic phase of i/r injury. our experiments support the possibility that p57kip <dig> modulates the stress signaling response after ischemia-reperfusion challenge. for example, we observed lower levels of jnk activity in the p57kip <dig> overexpressing mice. p57kip <dig> was shown to modulate stress-activated signaling and apoptosis by inhibiting c-jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase  in cultured human embryonic kidney cells, embryonic fibroblasts and myoblasts  <cit> . jnk is activated following ischemia/reperfusion injury, and when the kinase activity is repressed, the area of infarct damage is diminished  <cit> . however, phosphorylation alterations were not restricted to the jnk/mapk but involved other stress signaling molecules not known to be directly related to p57kip <dig> such as crystalline ab and heat shock protein  <dig> , mek <dig>  marcks, akt <dig>  pkcδ and pkcγ. while activation of some of these proteins is reported to be protective in cardiac disease , genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of some others such as jnk/mapk, akt <dig> and pkc has been reported to have conflicting or unknown roles, with both protective and detrimental ramifications for cardiomyocytes after in vitro and in vivo hypoxic injury  <cit> . although, the mechanism for these phosphorylation changes is not known at this point, these data support the possibility that the p57kip2-mediated cardioprotection is associated with wide changes of the stress signaling cascade. these findings indicate that p57kip <dig> protein may be a converging point for the regulation of cellular stress, cell proliferation and apoptosis.

studies from human patients with both acute and end-stage heart failure reveal that ckis revert to a fetal pattern of expression, i.e., p21cip1and p27kip <dig> decline, while p57kip <dig> is significantly increased  <cit> . in addition, a recent analysis of the transcriptional regulation of the human proximal tubular epithelial cell response to hypoxia identified p57kip <dig> among a tightly regulated cluster of  <dig> genes that demonstrated time-dependent up-regulation in response to hypoxia and a distinct down-regulation upon reoxygenation  <cit> . significantly, p57kip <dig> was up-regulated at early time points of hypoxia indicating it was within the early wave of hypoxia-responsive genes rather than being secondarily induced  <cit> . p57kip <dig> is normally highly expressed in the heart during midgestation, a time when the coronary arteries are not yet connected to the aortic root and the fetal heart grows in a low oxygen tension environment. these observations suggest a protective role for p57kip <dig> under conditions of limited oxygen supply. our results provide additional support for this protective role of p57kip <dig> in the setting of hypoxia by demonstrating that persistent expression of p57kip <dig> in cardiomyocytes attenuates the ischemia-reperfusion injury in the adult mouse heart.

p57kip <dig> over-expression has been reported by us and other investigators in two independent mouse models of thin myocardium, one resulting from mutation of the pax <dig> transcription factor   <cit>  and the other from deletion of the secreted factor bmp <dig>  <cit> . this phenotype was associated with a reduction in cardiomyocyte proliferative activity, while there was no evidence of increased apoptosis. these findings are consistent with early suppression of cardiomyocyte replication and increased differentiation associated with enhanced activity of p57kip <dig> in the mutant mouse hearts. the mechanism for p57kip <dig> up-regulation in these two models remains unknown, but given the different nature of their genetic defects, a direct transcriptional regulation is unlikely to be involved. an alternative explanation for this finding could be that p57kip <dig> up-regulation represents a secondary, adaptation type of response, or a selective survival of the p57kip <dig> expressing cardiomyocytes under conditions of increased stress imposed on the developmentally impaired thin myocardial wall.

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated a transgenic mouse model that allows specific forced expression of p57kip <dig> in cardiomyocytes. the forced expression of p57kip <dig> in cardiomyocytes did not affect heart development, growth or baseline cardiac function. however, the continuous presence of p57kip <dig> in the adult mouse heart results in resistance to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and improved recovery of cardiac function. preservation of myocardiac function after ischemia/reperfusion depends on critical adaptive responses of the stress signaling network. in the case of p57kip <dig> overexpression, the exact mechanism of this cardioprotection has not been fully elucidated, but it was associated with wide range modulations of proteins in stress signaling pathways. it is conceivable that p57kip <dig> is part of the pre-conditioning process that protects the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injury and may constitute a new therapeutic target for ischemic cardiac disease.

as hypoxic stress contributes to many biological disorders, p57kip <dig> may be of general physiological importance for controlling cell proliferation and death under conditions of limited oxygen availability during embryonic cardiac development and pathologic ischemic conditions of adulthood. comparison of the physiological state of embryonic development with pathologic conditions of cardiac stress in adulthood, suggests that in adult cardiomyocytes, the genetic response to stress is to revert to the expression of fetal genetic patterns associated with embryonic cardiac development. p57kip <dig> appears to be one of these fetal genes, which re-emerges under conditions of hypoxic/ischemic stress. thus, the hypoxic developmental history may provide a useful insight in the adult heart's genetic response to ischemia, by the redeployment of genes that were adapted to the low oxygen tension characteristic of the fetal/embryonic environment.
