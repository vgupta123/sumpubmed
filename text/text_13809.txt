BACKGROUND
members of the genus aspergillus, including aspergillus niger, are distributed worldwide and are commonly present on decaying plant debris. these saprophytes degrade the complex molecules in plant cell materials by secreting an extensive assortment of hydrolytic enzymes  <cit> . since a. niger grows on organic matter over a wide range of temperature, 6–47°c, and ph,  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> , this fungus produces enzymes that are active in diverse environmental conditions. indeed, many enzymes produced by this fungus have already found application in the food, beverage, textile, agriculture, and paper and pulp industries  <cit> . a. niger is also widely used in the manufacture of organic acids including citric, gluconic and fumaric acids  <cit> . importantly, citric acid and many enzymes produced in a. niger have received 'generally regarded as safe' or gras status by the united states food and drug administration , and can therefore, be safely used for agro-food applications  <cit> .

aspergillus niger, with its long history of use for various industrial applications and the ability to efficiently produce native proteins, is an attractive host for the production of heterologous proteins  <cit> . the commercial production of heterologous proteins using a. niger started when genencor international  produced bovine chymosin in a. niger  <cit>  and received us fda approval for its application in cheese making. a. niger has subsequently been used as an expression host to produce commercially viable levels of many heterologous proteins, including; human cytokine interleukin - <dig>   <cit> , phanerochaete chrysosporium manganese peroxidase   <cit> , barley alpha-amylase  <cit> , porcine pancreatic prophospholipase a <dig>   <cit> , and correctly assembled human immunoglobulins  <cit> .

aspergillus niger is presently one of the most important organisms used in biotechnology. reflecting this, there are  <dig> genomic dna and mrna sequence entries representing  <dig> unique genes available in genbank databases . the identification of additional genes will enhance further efforts to increase the industrial utility of this organism. analysis of est sequences provides a cost-effective approach for gene discovery. furthermore, est-derived sequences facilitate genome sequence annotation through the identification of transcription unit boundaries, exon-intron junctions, and genes that lack sequence similarity with previously discovered genes. for these reasons, we initiated an a. niger est-based gene discovery program. using normalization methods to enrich for cdna templates representing weakly expressed genes we identified  <dig>  unique genes of which  <dig> % encode proteins with significant similarity to genbank entries that have at least a tentatively assigned function. using the gene ontology hierarchy  <cit> , we present a classification of the proteins encoded by these a. niger genes and compare its protein repertoire with other well-studied fungal species. our annotated a. niger est collection is available at our website  <cit> .

RESULTS
library normalization and subtraction
a major challenge confronting est-based gene discovery programs is differential mrna abundance. usually, a few hundred highly and moderately expressed genes produce more than half of the cellular mrna molecules, whereas several thousand genes account for the remaining mrna mass  <cit> . sequencing randomly selected clones from standard cdna libraries therefore inefficiently identifies rare transcripts, owing to the repeated occurrence of moderately and highly abundant cdna species. we employed virtual subtraction and direct subtraction to enhance the number of unique genes identified. the virtual subtraction method  <cit>  classifies cdna clones according to the abundance of the mrnas they represent . the direct subtraction method removes previously identified cdna clones from the gene discovery pipeline. we initiated this est-based gene discovery program by sequencing  <dig>  randomly selected clones. next, we sequenced  <dig>  of the low intensity clones identified by virtual subtraction. finally, we sequenced  <dig>  clones that gave very low hybridization signals when subjected to both virtual and direct subtraction.

contig assembling and analysis of a. niger ests
we submitted the  <dig>  high quality ests to genbank . table  <dig> shows that the individual sequencing reads contained 400– <dig> nucleotides of high-quality sequence. the est assembly produced by phrap  <cit>  yielded  <dig>  unisequences that included  <dig>  singletonsand  <dig>  contigs. following assembly, we used blastn to cluster the closely related singletons and contigs. clustering assembled  <dig> of the  <dig>  phrap unisequences into  <dig> clusters, each containing 2– <dig> sequences. manually confirmed clustalw alignments showed that  <dig> clusters were generated by assembling alternatively spliced derivatives of  <dig> phrap unisequences. taking into account the  <dig> clusters assembled from multiple unisequences, the  <dig>  ests generated  <dig>  clusters. the clusters predicted to have arisen through alternative splicing are available in additional file  <dig>  prior to submission of our est sequences, we found  <dig> a. niger genomic dna and cdna-derived sequence entries in the genbank database . these entries formed  <dig> unique genes. blastn analysis showed that  <dig> of the phrap unisequences aligned with at least one of the a. niger genbank entries . therefore, this study identified about  <dig>  new a. niger genes. the results from our est sequencing, contig assembly and clustering analysis are summarized in table  <dig> 

comparative analysis of the phrap unisequences
we attempted to determine the putative function of the set of  <dig>  phrap unisequences by searching for homologs in the genbank non-redundant protein database using blastx . setting the blastx cutoff value at e = 1e - <dig>  about 83% of these sequences display similarity to at least one genbank entry,  <dig> % to genes of known function and 38% to genes of unknown function. the remaining sequences,  <dig> %, code for proteins that lack similarity with any genbank entry.

we also compared the proteins encoded by these sequences with the proteins predicted from the completely sequenced genomes of three ascomycetes, saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , aspergillus nidulans and neurospora crassa  <cit> , and one basidiomycete, the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium  <cit> . as expected, the highest degree of similarity  is with a. nidulans, where 64% of these a. niger unisequences encode proteins that have a. nidulans homologs . nonetheless, almost 20% of the a. niger genes did not have a homolog  in a. nidulans.

although the sordariomycetes, which include n. crassa, and the eurotiomycetes, which include the aspergilli, diverged about  <dig> million years  ago  <cit> , over 43% of the predicted a. niger proteins are highly similar  to n. crassa predicted proteins. for the more distantly related saccharomycotinna s. cerevisiae and hymenomycete p. chrysosporium, which diverged from the eurotiomycetes lineage about  <dig>  and  <dig>  myr ago, respectively  <cit> , only 21% and 25% of the a. niger predicted proteins had highly similar homologs .

functional classification of genes based on gene ontology terms
the predicted a. niger protein products were assigned gene ontology  classifiers based on blastx alignments  generated by searching the go annotated swiss-prot and trembl databases. go categories were assigned to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  predicted protein products. figure  <dig> summarizes the resulting go assignments, which are available in additional file  <dig>  more detailed annotations, including the blast alignments, expect values and blast scores generated by searching the genbank nr database are available online  <cit>  and can be used to assess the reliability of functional predictions on a gene by gene basis.

we compared the distribution of go classifiers obtained for the a. niger unisequences and the predicted genes of six fungal species . the gene distribution in the main ontology categories was very similar across all seven species. however, the fission and budding yeasts have a higher proportion of genes in the "cell growth and/or maintenance" categories,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, than did the filamentous fungi, where the proportion ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. since we found no correlation between evolutionary distance and these differences, it seems likely that they reflect differences in gene number. the genomes of the five filamentous fungi encode  <dig> – <dig>  genes  <cit>  whereas the fission and baker's yeast genomes have about  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit>  protein-coding genes, respectively. the much smaller number of genes present in these two yeast species suggests that they may have close to the minimum number of genes needed by a free-living eukaryotic cell  <cit> .

identification of putative secreted proteins
aspergillus niger is the source of a number of secreted proteins produced for various industrial applications. gene ontology mapping categorized only  <dig> of the predicted proteins as "extracellular" . however, we were able to assign a go component classifier to only  <dig>   of the encoded proteins. to identify potential secreted proteins we used signalp  <dig>  <cit>  to search for proteins with a secretion signal. signalp predicted that about  <dig> of the predicted proteins had a signal peptide . blast searches showed that  <dig> of these proteins were similar to at least one genbank entry. the 27% of predicted proteins with a signal peptide that do not have a genbank homolog is significantly higher that the  <dig> % of predicted orphan proteins. the reason for these differences remains unknown although they may suggest that the fungal secretome is subject to rapid evolution.

characterization of secretion pathway proteins
recent strategies for improving the efficiency of heterologous protein expression in a. niger have focused on molecular genetic manipulation of the secretory pathway. in some cases, these approaches have significantly increased the expression of selected heterologous proteins  <cit> . using go mappings and blast analysis we identified  <dig> genes that apparently participate in various steps of the protein secretion pathway . fifteen genes encode secretion-related er chaperones, foldases and proteases;  <dig> encode putative proteins involved in protein transport, protein targeting and vesicle-mediated transport; and  <dig> code for proteins that are involved in secretion-related post-translational modifications. the a. niger genes identified in this study included all the previously identified secretion-related er chaperones, foldases and quality control proteins: bipa , pdia , prpa , tiga , cybb , clxa  , and kexb    <cit> .

previous studies with a. niger identified five secretion-related gtpases belonging to the ras super-family, srga, srgb, srgc, srgd, and srge, and one member of the arf/sar subfamily, sara  <cit> . our a. niger sequences included the earlier identified sara , srga , srgb  and srge  genes. we also identified contigs asp <dig>  which encodes a protein with 47% similarity to the s. cerevisiae gtp-binding protein ypt <dig>  <cit> , and asp <dig> and asp <dig> that code for proteins with 87% and 94% identity with aspergillus nidulans members of the rab subfamily of small gtpases  <cit> .

post-translational modifications such as glycosylations are often important for the production of biologically active secreted proteins. for instance, introducing an n-glycosylation site into bovine chymosin increased the amount of secreted chymosin expressed by a. niger 10-fold  <cit> . identification of the various genes involved in o- and n- linked glycosylations  <cit>  would facilitate efforts to engineer the a. niger glycosylation pathway. we identified several putative members of the n- and o-linked protein glycosylation pathways, including; six ptm related o-mannosyltransferases, contigs asp <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig>  and asp <dig>  <cit>  and genes that are involved in n-linked protein glycosylation such as two contigs, asp <dig>  and asp <dig>  that encode homologs of oligosaccharyl transferases  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the  <dig>  ests identified in this study represent a major attempt to define the a. niger gene set and represent about  <dig>  genes. these data dramatically increase the number of identified a. niger genes. we have established a searchable web-based database that includes annotations for each est and the derived contig assemblies to facilitate research community access to this important resource.

annotation of the phrap unisequences revealed that 83% had a putative homolog in other species, and therefore about 17% represented novel genes. the template cdna clones, and their derived est and contig sequences provide a basis for studying the function of individual genes as well as genome-wide studies of the regulatory networks and cellular functions that define a. niger. they will also assist gene identification, mapping and annotation efforts once the draft genome sequence of a. niger is completed and released. a. niger, known for its efficient secretion machinery, is widely used as a host for the production of native and foreign secreted proteins. however, for many proteins problems have arisen in obtaining high amounts in the culture medium. this study identified  <dig> putative secreted proteins, and  <dig> proteins that are putatively involved in various steps of the protein secretion pathway. these sequences should facilitate future efforts to engineering a. niger strains with improved secretion capabilities for proteins presently difficult to express. additional details about this study and access to the a. niger est database can be found on our fungal genomics web site  <cit> .
