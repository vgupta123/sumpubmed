BACKGROUND
green leaves have commonly been considered the primary source of photosynthate production. in addition to their leaves, higher plants can potentially use almost any vegetative or reproductive structure to perform photosynthetic co <dig> assimilation for growth and development  <cit> . in wheat, there are a number of non-foliar organs that are photosynthetically active, including all parts of the ear and the exposed part of the peduncle, all of which can assimilate co <dig> when they are exposed to light  <cit> . in an investigation into the effects of defoliation of spring wheat on grain yield, rosyara et al.  found that the yield reduction was lower than expected when the upper two leaves were removed for all genotypes examined  <cit> . they proposed that the photosynthetic behaviour of other sources played a compensatory role in stabilising the yield. an accumulating body of evidence suggests that non-foliar green organs may contribute as much as 40-50% of the photosynthates required by developing wheat grains  <cit> .

the peduncle, which is located at the first internode directly below the spike, has a diversity of critical roles in crop productivity. development of the vascular system in the peduncle is essential for transporting assimilates to the filling grain  <cit> . elongation of the exposed part of the peduncle lessens the risk of leaf-borne pathogen infections in the ear by increasing the distance between the upper leaves and the ear  <cit> . under drought stress or high temperatures, this organ  maintains significantly higher water potential than the flag leaf  <cit> . the upper part of the peduncle develops leaf-like autotrophic carbohydrate metabolism when it is exposed to high irradiance  <cit> , accounting for a high proportion of the photosynthesis of the stem  <cit> . wang et al.  suggested that photosynthesis in the exposed peduncle and flag leaf sheath contribute about 9-12% of grain dry mass, depending on the wheat cultivar  <cit> . although the exposed peduncle has been identified as one of the photosynthetically active organs in wheat, the structure of the chloroplasts and the functional events related to photosynthesis and the translocation of photosynthates during the period of grain-filling have not precisely characterised. evidence from ultrastructural observations and photochemical assays is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which the exposed peduncle produces photoassimilates for grain development.

the thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts accommodate all of the molecular complexes that perform the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis and provide a medium for energy transduction. psii is one of the key complexes clustered in the appressed regions of the granum stacks in the thylakoid membrane system  <cit> . the integrity and organisation of the thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis. little information is available on the chloroplast ultrastructure of exposed peduncles or their temporal variations in photochemical efficiency during grain-filling. pepcase functions as a primary carboxylase in the cytoplasm, fixing ambient co <dig>  re-fixing respiratorily released co <dig> and then producing the carbon skeleton for the tricarboxylic acid cycle  <cit> . monitoring the temporal changes in pepcase activity is therefore crucial for evaluating photosynthetic assimilatory capacity in plants.

the purpose of this study was to investigate the photosynthetic features of the exposed part of the wheat peduncle and its photosynthetic contribution to grain-filling. the flag leaf was used as a reference since it is the main source of photosynthate for the developing grain  <cit> . particular attention has been given to the anatomical, ultrastructural and photo-physiological characteristics of the exposed peduncle that contribute to its photosynthetic performance.

RESULTS
growth and anatomy of the exposed peduncle
at stage  <dig>  the peduncle length was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm  of this length was exposed above the flag leaf sheath. the peduncle continued to grow at a mean rate of about  <dig> mm d- <dig> until the eighth day after anthesis. at this time, the peduncle reached a final length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm , of which  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm  was exposed. at maturity, the diameter of the exposed peduncle was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  at the basal end and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  at the upper end .

cross-sections of the exposed wheat peduncles showed the epidermis, sclerenchyma, chlorenchyma strands, ground parenchyma, and the vascular strands . the chlorenchyma strands were composed of cells rich in chloroplasts at the early stages . the number of chloroplasts in the chlorenchyma cells was reduced at stage  <dig> . stomata occurred frequently  and in rows that were arranged longitudinally along the stem . the average stomatal density reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm- <dig> on the exposed part of the peduncle . this measure was significantly higher than the density measured on the adaxial face of the flag leaf  and the density recorded on the abaxial face of the flag leaf .

in the exposed peduncles, the cells contained well-differentiated chloroplasts at a higher density than those of the flag leaves at stage  <dig>  although the chloroplasts were not regular in shape and the granum arrangement was not regular, the chloroplasts were full of a large number of thylakoids and the grana lamellae were well-organised and clearly discernible. unlike the flag leaves, the exposed peduncles lacked starch granules in the chloroplasts . at stage  <dig>  no notable changes were observed in the ultrastructure or the shape of the chloroplasts . at stage  <dig>  even though the number of chloroplasts decreased and nuclei in some cells disappeared, the chloroplasts contained a large number of thylakoids and the matrix of the chloroplasts was still dense. at this stage, the number of plastoglobuli increased noticeably and numerous small vesicles or membrane-like fragments were observed in the cytoplasm . at stage  <dig>  the chloroplasts became spherical, and an apparent increase in the plastoglobulus content was observed. although the nucleus disappeared in almost all of the cells, the membranes constituting the thylakoids were still very distinct and plentiful. the most striking changes occurred in the structure of the thylakoids, i.e., loss of the parallel arrangement of the grana lamellae became evident in some chloroplasts, and some of the thylakoids became swollen . at stage  <dig>  the number of chloroplasts decreased noticeably ; the envelope and the thylakoids of the grana were indistinctly discriminated one from another. however, the grana lamellae were still abundant in comparison to the complete disruption of the thylakoid membrane system in the flag leaves .

chlorophyll fluorescence
the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters varied similarly in flag leaves and exposed peduncles during grain-filling. in the flag leaves, values of fv/fm and Φpsii remained almost constant  at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the values of fv/fm and Φpsii in the flag leaves decreased sharply, and this was partly attributable to the occurrence of severe senescence initiated at the leaf tip . in the exposed peduncles, both fv/fm and Φpsii presented remarkably similar values at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these values, which remained at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, were slightly lower than those found in the flag leaves. in subsequent stages, the values steadily declined; however, the decline was slower than in the flag leaves. as a result, the values of fv/fm and Φpsii in the exposed peduncles were slightly higher at stage  <dig>  and significantly higher at stage  <dig>  than those in the flag leaves. thus, a relatively high level of psii activity was maintained in the exposed peduncles during the late stages of grain-filling.

pepcase activity
the maximum pepcase activity in the flag leaves  was observed at stage 1; this value then gradually decreased to  <dig>  μmol mg- <dig> pro min- <dig> at stage  <dig> . in the exposed peduncles, the pepcase activity was only  <dig>  μmol mg- <dig> pro min- <dig> at stage  <dig>  which was significantly lower than that in the flag leaves at this stage. the activity increased and reached its maximum of  <dig>  μmol mg- <dig> pro min- <dig> at stage  <dig>  close to that observed in the flag leaves. towards stage  <dig>  the pepcase activity began to decline, but the decline was lower than in the flag leaves. as a result, the exposed peduncle pepcase activity was slightly higher than that in the flag leaves at stages  <dig>  and  <dig> , and it was significantly higher at stage  <dig>  .

photosynthetic contribution of the exposed peduncle to grain growth
no difference in grain mass was found between darkened and non-darkened plants from the commencement of grain-filling at stage <dig> and  <dig> . a slight reduction in grain mass in the darkened wheat was observed at stage  <dig>  and the reduction was found to be significant at stage  <dig>  and at stage  <dig> .

discussion
in this study, we observed that stomata occurred over the chlorenchyma strands at a higher density in exposed peduncles than in flag leaves. stomata are involved in two of the most important plant processes, photosynthesis and transpiration  <cit> . a higher stomatal density would ensure a higher photosynthetic efficiency even at sub-optimal co <dig> concentrations  <cit> . the higher stomatal density in exposed peduncles may therefore make an important contribution to the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant by increasing the surface area for gas exchange and improving the photosynthetic conversion of solar energy. in addition, the higher stomatal density in exposed peduncles might improve plant viability in hot environments  at the late stages of grain-filling because of the cooling effect of stomatal transpiration on the peduncle and the canopy  <cit> .

recently, chloroplasts that are present in non-foliar organs have been found to be of have been found to be functionally important for photosynthesis and consequently also for grain yield in wheat  <cit> . high photosynthetic activity is characterised by well-developed chloroplasts with a high proportion of grana  <cit> . because the integrity of cellular organelles and well-preserved membrane systems are essential for photosynthesis  <cit> , a close relationship is expected to exist between chloroplast ultrastructure and the photosynthetic capacity during grain growth. in our study, we found that the chloroplasts in flag leaves had well-organised thylakoids and a well-organised structure at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  at subsequent growth stages, the thylakoid membranes degraded and the starch granule population declined concomitantly with an increase in plastoglobuli, indicating that leaf senescence had commenced  <cit> . in exposed peduncles, the chlorenchyma cells contained a large number of chloroplasts, each developing numerous grana with a high proportion of granal stacks at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  given that the chloroplasts in the exposed peduncles remained more structurally conserved at stages  <dig> and  <dig> , it is reasonable to propose that exposed peduncles remain functionally active during grain-filling. the exposed peduncle makes additional contributions to assimilate production, especially when the flag leaf senesces quickly and its photosynthetic activity declines. as one of the photosynthetically active organs, the exposed peduncle also has the advantage of being located nearer to the grains than the flag leaf. thus, the photosynthetic assimilates are directly transferred to the grain along a short path.

fv/fm and Φpsii are important indicators of photosynthetic capacity. psii efficiency has also been shown to be an effective indicator of leaf senescence in plants  <cit> . in this study, the results for fv/fm and Φpsii demonstrated that the rates remained relatively constant in both organs; no significant differences were observed between these two organs at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that the exposed part of the peduncle had efficient light utilisation by psii. however, the rates in the exposed peduncles declined relatively slowly thereafter, in contrast to the dramatic decreases in the flag leaves. as a result, the rates were higher in the exposed peduncles than in the flag leaves at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  it has been demonstrated that natural and/or stress-induced senescence causes a loss of photosynthetic capacity  <cit> . the slower decline in psii efficiency thus suggests that the exposed peduncle senesces more slowly than the flag leaf and can continue to function longer during grain-filling, and this may be important for maintaining grain growth at late stages. because psii is mostly located in the granal thylakoids of the chloroplast  <cit> , the reduction in psii efficiency might be correlated with reduced thylakoid integrity. this hypothesis has been confirmed by tem observation of the ultrastructure of chloroplasts as described above.

of particular interest is the observation that the values of fv/fm and Φpsii remained high in both exposed peduncle and flag leaf even at stage  <dig>  it is tempting to suggest that the higher than expected psii efficiency is associated with greater source strength at the mid-grain-filling stage.

during grain-filling, pepcase is more important for maintaining carbon assimilation activity in the non-foliar organs than ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase   <cit> . the pepcase activity in non-foliar organs has therefore been considered an important biochemical characteristic of wheat plants with high photosynthetic efficiency  <cit> . in our study, we found that the variation in pepcase activity over time differed between the flag leaf and the exposed peduncle. at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the activity of this enzyme was lower in the exposed peduncle, whereas the activity was higher at late stages, especially stages  <dig> and  <dig>  because pepcase supplies substrates for carbohydrate synthesis and its activity in the exposed peduncle is high during late grain-filling, the exposed peduncle may play an important role in assimilate production, especially at the late stage of grain growth. given that pepcase activity is closely associated with the variation in photosynthetic heat tolerance among organs of the same plant and that high temperature stress occurs frequently during late grain-filling in northern china  <cit> , it is reasonable to postulate that the higher pepcase activity in the exposed peduncle may lend it better photosynthetic thermotolerance than the flag leaf. this would confer an ecological advantage to wheat plants under warmer conditions.

using organ-darkening treatments, the relative contributions of the green organs to yield grain can be estimated  <cit> . in the present study, no difference in grain mass was found between darkened and non-darkened plants at stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the photosynthates produced prior to the treatment were sufficient to meet the relatively lower requirement of the weaker sink strength in the early stages of grain development. at late developmental stages, we observed significant reductions in grain growth in dark-treated wheat . the difference in grain mass between the exposed peduncle darkening treatment and the control could be due to the reduced availability of photoassimilates from the exposed peduncle. we therefore hypothesise that assimilates from the exposed green part of the peduncle make an important contribution to grain growth.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that the exposed peduncle possesses anatomical, ultrastructural and physiological advantages over the flag leaf for performing photosynthesis. these advantages are especially obvious in the later stages of grain-filling. the higher stomatal density and the higher activity of heat-tolerant pepcase revealed that the exposed peduncle has a superior ability to adapt to the ecological environment at the later stages of grain-filling. based on the data presented here, we conclude that the exposed peduncle has a strong photosynthetic capacity and provides assimilates for the development of grain mass during grain-filling.
