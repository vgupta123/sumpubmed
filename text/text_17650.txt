BACKGROUND
the interest in utilizing cyanobacterial systems for producing biofuels is increasing as our understanding of metabolism in these photosynthetic microorganisms improves. the ability to utilize carbon acquired from the atmosphere as feedstock along with energy provided by light to produce valuable chemicals and fuels  is even more appealing in diazotrophic strains, since they can grow in the absence of combined nitrogen. members of the unicellular genus cyanothece have strong diurnal and circadian cycling of central metabolic processes and the development of a stable genetic manipulation system has been successful in the strain cyanothece sp. pcc  <dig>   <cit> . in general, members of cyanothece have well-defined rhythms when grown under n2-fixing conditions, using light/dark or continuous light illumination  <cit> . during the light phase of growth, light energy is utilized in photosynthesis to secure and store co <dig> in intracellular carbohydrate granules. during the dark period, photosynthesis shuts down and respiration utilizes the glucose stored in carbohydrate granules to produce energy and to consume intracellular oxygen. this enables the o2-sensitive nitrogenase to function properly during the dark period. the nitrogenase enzymes allow the cell to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a process which also releases high levels of hydrogen gas  <cit> .

cyanothece sp. atcc  <dig>  has been studied in great detail and was the first of these unicellular diazotrophs to be sequenced. the high coordination and diurnal oscillations of main metabolic processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation allowed for keen insights into the robust metabolisms of this strain. these characteristics led to a series of transcriptional studies  and improvements in hydrogen production  <cit> . with the advancement of technology, proteomic studies were performed which unveiled a network of interacting protein systems that play off of each other, one system setting up the cellular environment for the next . the work described in aryal et al.  <cit>  was the first to involve proteomics in cyanothece  <dig>  in addition to transcriptomics, and demonstrated that many fewer proteins cycled than did transcripts. that study, and a proteomics comparison between cyanothece  <dig> and cyanothece  <dig>  <cit> , indicated that both strains have a higher level of the nitrogenase, respiration and glycogen degradation enzymes in the dark than in the light. thus, protein cycling throughout the day and night is of functional significance.

research into cyanothece  <dig> continues, but mutant generation is problematic due to high levels of illegitimate recombination that prevents stable homologous recombination efforts. due to this, the utility of cyanothece  <dig> as a biological chassis is limited. min and sherman  <cit>  overcame this hurdle in cyanothece  <dig> with the first demonstration of stable genetic modification. this study showcased the difficulty of obtaining stable mutants in most cyanothece strains and how to improve transformation efficiency by introducing linear, single-stranded, oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations flanked by fragments homologous to a chromosomal insertion site. more recently, zhang et al.  <cit>  provided another example of stable genetic modification in cyanothece  <dig> with the generation of a hupl mutant. this mutant led to the unexpected finding that inactivating the uptake hydrogenase in cyanothece  <dig> lowered h <dig> evolution and nitrogenase activity, thus demonstrating the importance of hupls in protecting nitrogenase from o <dig> toxicity.

transcriptional and proteomic studies on cyanothece  <dig> thus far have compared the metabolic capabilities of cyanothece  <dig> with the other cyanothece genus members. recent work by aryal et al.  <cit>  reported the protein and transcript abundances in cyanothece  <dig> and  <dig> under  <dig> conditions, including nitrogen depletion and mixotrophy. another study has compared the proteomic expression of five cyanothece strains in order to determine the metabolic capabilities within the cyanothece strains  <cit> . these initial studies have shown that, although the two cyanothece strains contain quite similar proteomes, they exhibit different protein abundances. these differences suggest the presence of varied cellular strategies in response to altered environmental conditions.

in this study, we utilized transcriptomic and proteomic methods to quantify the relationship between transcription and translation underlying central and secondary metabolism in response to nitrogen fixation at four time points across a  <dig> h period consisting of  <dig> hour light and  <dig> hour dark. we identified dynamic relationships between transcription and translation, suggesting that there are many levels of regulation in addition to that at the transcriptional level. our results provide a better understanding of metabolism of cyanothece  <dig> in light and dark conditions and how the metabolic partitioning can be of importance for biofuel production.

RESULTS
rna-sequencing and microarray correlation
cyanothece  <dig> was grown in nitrogen-free bg- <dig> media  <cit>  with reduced phosphate  <cit>  under  <dig> h light –  <dig> h dark conditions for three consecutive days. on the third day of exponential growth, cells were collected for rna-sequencing  and proteomics at four time points across the light/dark cycle. material was collected at the beginning of the light period , three hours into the light period , at the end of the light period , and three hours into the dark period . these time points represent sunrise , mid-morning , sunset  and mid-night  and display the full range of expression differences as previously demonstrated in cyanothece  <dig>  <cit> .

since this represented the first rna-seq analysis for cyanothece  <dig> mrna transcripts, we compared the results with those from a microarray platform that was constructed as described previously for cyanothece  <dig> and could provide a frame of reference for the results  <cit> . transcriptional expression data was consistent between the two methods. overall,  <dig> and  <dig> gene products were detected in total from the rna-seq and microarray, respectively, and there were ~2-fold more differentially expressed  genes detected in the rna-seq at all time points measured . this difference was as expected, as similar comparisons have shown that rna-seq has a lower background signal and a larger dynamic range in expression levels compared to microarrays .figure  <dig>

statistical comparison indicated that results obtained from the two platforms were highly comparable. scatter plots were generated using log <dig> fold change  values of significantly differentially expressed genes  from d <dig> vs. l <dig>  d <dig> vs. l <dig> and l <dig> vs. l <dig>  and the spearman correlation coefficients for each of the comparisons used to generate the scatter plots were calculated using ‘cor’ function in r. these coefficient values are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  spearman values, especially for significant genes, are comparable with similar studies  <cit> . with this as a basis, our analysis focused on the rna-seq data as it provided a more complete analysis of the differential transcription. additional file 4: figure s <dig> is a comparison heat map showing the expression patterns of genes from the main functional categories.

light-dependent expression of functionally relevant pathways
the unicellular diazotrophs of the genus cyanothece follow strong light–dark oscillations for the major physiological functions of nitrogen fixation, respiration and photosynthesis. thus, we chose sample times that would enable us to determine the type of transcriptional oscillations in cyanothece  <dig> and allow us to compare our results to that of cyanothece  <dig>  this permitted us to discuss differential transcription between early  light and dark periods, respectively.

in figure  <dig>  the number of genes significantly  upregulated 2-fold  and downregulated 2-fold  are presented. prior to the transition into the light and dark periods , we see the highest number of differentially expressed genes consistent with the understanding that the cell needs to strongly adjust its enzymatic repertoire to meet the different needs of photosynthesis during the light period, and glycolytic processes and nitrogen fixation during the dark. observing the expression of core metabolic genes peaking at the onset  or in the case of cyanothece  <dig> in this study, l <dig> and d <dig>  is a notable characteristic of diurnal gene regulation in cyanobacteria  <cit> . at d <dig>  vs. l <dig>  we see the expression of genes for dark metabolic activities such as hydrogenase, nitrogenase, and tca cycle. at l <dig>  vs. d <dig>  genes for light metabolism, such as photosynthesis and carbohydrate storage, begin to be upregulated as the cell enters the light phase. details of each comparison population are provided in additional file 5: table s <dig>  this table has a worksheet for each of the comparisons shown in the venn diagram, identifying each gene and  that is differentially regulated.figure  <dig> 
venn diagram displaying the number of genes significantly up  and down  regulated ≥2-fold across the various time points measured. detailed listing of each group can be found in additional file 5: table s <dig> 



we concentrated our detailed analysis on the approximately  <dig> genes that comprise the major metabolic processes required for growth under diazotrophic, light–dark conditions, although the data for all genes is presented in the supplemental tables. during the light period, we observe high expression of genes related to bioenergetics, such as various nadh-quinone oxidoreductases and nadh dehydrogenases, and co <dig> fixation genes, such as carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism genes, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase and carbonic anhydrase. other light-enhanced genes are those involved in the gluconeogenesis pathway, as well as the reductive pentose phosphate pathway as indicated by the presence of ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase. most predominant are genes responsible for encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis and glycogen biosynthesis. as the cell enters the dark phase, many of these genes become down regulated and genes involved in nitrogen fixation and butanoate metabolism  become upregulated. in addition, genes of the tca cycle are highly expressed and genes encoding proteins in aerobic respiration, such as cytochrome oxidases, rieske  domain-containing proteins, and the uptake and bi-directional hydrogenase were strongly upregulated. of course, these proteins are also needed to deplete the intracellular oxygen levels in the cytoplasm in order to protect the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase enzymes. much of the key metabolic information contained in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig> and described above is visualized readily in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

 <dig> grown in 12-h light 12-h dark. bar thickness is a qualitative measure of the mrna levels at that time point. the two dark segments  are highlighted in black. the figure begins with the late light period  on the left to best represent the pattern of gene expression throughout the day to the early light period .



interestingly, the analysis indicated that the initiation of transcription of genes encoding some key metabolic functions was not restricted to the light or to the dark exclusively, as in cyanothece  <dig>  <cit> . for example, transcription of the n2-fixing enzymes, cyan7822_ <dig> to  <dig>  was upregulated in both the late light and the early dark. similarly, many enzymes involved in heme and pigment biosynthesis and genes encoding phycobiliproteins were upregulated >2fc at d3vsd <dig> and l0vsd <dig>  indicating that expression was high throughout much of the dark period from three hours into the dark up to the end of the dark period. the genes for cytochrome oxidase and those involved in hydrogenase and uptake hydrogenase activity were transcribed in the light so that the function would be available once the nitrogenase proteins were available in the late light period . in these cases, the genes were transcribed in preparation for the next important metabolic phase. all of these results are consistent with the physiological measurements  <cit> , which demonstrated nitrogen fixation and hydrogen production just prior to the dark period.

figure  <dig> emphasizes a few temporal points about transcription in cyanothece  <dig>  first, transcription of important metabolic functions typically began in a light period prior to their maximum expression. thus, nitrogen fixation genes transcription began in the light, but peaked at d <dig>  the same was true for the tca and much of the ppp cycle genes, as well as those involved with respiration. on the other hand, carbon fixation, starch metabolism and photosynthesis gene transcription began in the dark and peaked in the light. therefore, the transcription was not as tightly synchronized as in cyanothece  <dig> .

unexpectedly, there was an upregulation of a cmr <dig> family crispr-associated ramp gene . upon further investigation, a significant number of crispr  associated genes were expressed in cyanothece  <dig> and were mainly located near either end of the large linear plasmid . we will discuss the crispr genes in greater detail in the anti-sense and crispr expression section.figure  <dig> 
crispr genes on the large, linear plasmid  are located on both ends of the fragment and are highly transcribed in the late dark, early light period. five repeat arrays were identified using crisprfinder and the crisprdb  <cit>  and are represented as bars with the numbers 1– <dig> 



protein expression
one objective of this study was to compare and contrast protein expression with the transcriptional data in order to investigate in-phase and anti-phase abundance maxima  <cit> . we were able to generate a large protein dataset containing  <dig> quantifiable proteins from the four time points. we again focused on proteins that were involved with key metabolic pathways as outlined in additional file 2: table s <dig>  these proteins and their kinetics over the  <dig> time periods are shown in additional file 7: table s <dig>  the experiment identified key proteins in each of the major functional categories that led to some important insights into the regulation of metabolism in this unicellular diazotroph.

proteins involved with cellular bioenergetics were mainly present in the dark. the highest levels of the cytochrome oxidase operon proteins, cyan7822_4711- <dig>  were found in the dark, suggesting that this complex was used for respiration during the n2-fixing dark phase. only one protein from the other complex, cyan7822_ <dig>  was identified and it was more constant throughout the experiment, although it dropped to the lowest levels at l <dig>  the nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  cyan7822_ <dig>  had levels some 2x higher at d <dig> than at the other times, also indicating that this protein was part of a dark-inducible complex.

as also seen in cyanothece  <dig>  proteins encoded by the nitrogenase cluster genes were differentially expressed with a peak at d <dig> for all proteins except for nifd, which peaked at the end of the dark period. in a complementary fashion, the proteins involved in glutamate metabolism tended to be at higher levels in the late dark to early light.

proteins involved in central metabolism  demonstrated varied expression patterns . the figure displays the relative fold change of mrna levels with time in the upper two panels for each metabolic pathway along with the fold change in proteins levels with respect to time in the lower panel. the figure demonstrates that protein levels typically did not vary more than 25% throughout the daily cycle. however, in specific cases, the expression patterns demonstrated a light vs. dark periodicity. for example, most of the proteins for glycolysis were similar in the light and in the dark. nonetheless, both copies of phosphofructokinase  were expressed; one peaked in the light  and one peaked in the late dark period . similarly, two fba proteins were expressed, one in the light  and one in the dark . neither protein was found exclusively in one time period, but the data suggested that fba <dig>  was strongly upregulated in the late dark and early light, whereas fba <dig>  was upregulated more in the late light and early dark periods. in both cases, the proteins were at reasonable levels throughout the light and the dark, although the results suggested that different pfk and fba proteins were expressed at different times for slightly different cellular needs. the tca cycle proteins that were identified were slightly higher in the light, indicating that this pathway is mostly involved with generating metabolites. some of the proteins in the pentose phosphate pathway, such as rpi and rpe, are also involved with co <dig> fixation, and they were upregulated in the light. this paralled the induction of rubp carboxylase, rbcls, that was upregulated nearly 2-fold in the late-dark and early-light periods . on the other hand, ppp proteins were slightly upregulated in the early dark, and lowest in the late dark period, which suggested that a primary function was to provide reducing equivalents for n <dig> fixation during the early dark period. importantly, glycogen synthase was strongly light regulated, appropriate for construction of the glycogen granules during carbon fixation. the two glycogen phosphorylase genes were both expressed as protein at all  <dig> time periods, but with slightly different kinetics: glgp <dig>  had the highest abundance in the early light , whereas glgp <dig>  was highest in the late dark . in a similar fashion, glga <dig> had a 3-fold higher level in the late-dark/early light than at other times, whereas glga <dig> was much more constant throughout the cycle.figure  <dig>

relationship between transcription and translation
nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis
the relationship between transcription and translation was one of the main objectives of this study and we again concentrated on the key metabolic categories. the nitrogenase gene cluster represents an important standard for such comparisons and is shown in figure  <dig>  these genes are all located in a large cluster and appear to be coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level, primarily in the dark. we were able to detect all of the proteins at all time points, except for nifz and nifx. for this group of genes, there was a great deal of correspondence between the timing of transcription and the appearance of the protein. the only one that was not in phase was nifd where the peak protein abundance lagged that of the mrna. the protein abundance in the late light is high and quite similar to the mrna pattern, thus establishing the nitrogenase cluster as an example of in-phase transcription/translation. the intensity of expression changes was substantial, with fold changes ranging from  <dig> to > <dig> at the onset of the dark period. this emphasizes that the late light/early dark phase is the critical period for nitrogen fixation in cyanothece  <dig> figure  <dig>

 <dig> display consistent expression in both mrna and protein during the dark phase. it is notable that nifd show anti-phase abundance maxima with the respectable transcripts. peptides for the genes nifz and nifx were not detected in the analysis. the x-axis represents the four comparisons: d <dig> vs. l <dig> ; d <dig> vs. d <dig> ; d <dig> vs. l <dig> ; and, l <dig> vs. l <dig> .



in regard to proteins involved in photosynthesis, not surprisingly most of photosystem i  and photosystem ii  were higher in the light, whereas the cytb6/f complex and the atpase synthase were fairly constant across the light periods. the photosynthetic antennae proteins that form the phycobilisomes were mostly light upregulated, except for the linker proteins that were somewhat higher in the dark. however, there were two interesting features that are also found in cyanothece 51142: the psaab proteins were higher in the dark and one of the psba  proteins  was synthesized explicitly in the dark  than at the other time points). all sequenced cyanobacteria have multiple copies of psba and some of these copies have mutations that likely render d <dig> incapable of binding the mn4cao <dig> metallocluster; thus, psii complexes incorporating this altered di would be incapable of o <dig> evolution  <cit> . we have noted that alternate copies of d <dig> are used by cyanobacteria under different environmental conditions, including high light, anoxic conditions or n <dig> fixation  <cit> . we have postulated that under n2-fixing conditions, the expression of such a modified d <dig> will permit a complete psii complex to form, but one that cannot evolve o <dig>  the amount of psba <dig> in the dark indicated that this is an important feature in cyanothece  <dig> 

the cyanothece  <dig> genome contains  <dig> copies of the genes encoding the reaction center protein psba . three of these genes are virtually identical in sequence , psba <dig>  and psba <dig> ) and cannot be differentiated at the protein level. figure  <dig> shows that the rna levels for these  <dig> proteins are fairly constant over the  <dig> time periods in both the rna-seq  and microarray experiments  and that the composite protein level was also quite constant. however, psba <dig>  mrna was transcribed in the late light period and was high through the early dark. the protein was expressed in the late light and particularly strongly in the middle- to late-dark period. thus, the d <dig> from psba <dig> became an important component during n <dig> fixation when o <dig> levels should be at their lowest.figure  <dig>

 <dig>  solid bars represent rna-seq and protein data and empty bars represent microarray data. due to their near identical sequences, d <dig> proteins psba <dig> , psba <dig>  and psba <dig>  were quantitatively indistinguishable at the protein level. microarray data points consisted of fold changes at d0vsl <dig> , d4vsd <dig> , l0vsd <dig>  and l4vsl <dig> 



central metabolism
we collected a quite complete set of data for the enzymes in central metabolism and identified a number of different patterns of transcription and translation . in glycolysis, it appeared clear that differential expression at the transcriptional level had little to do with the abundance of the proteins at various times throughout the diurnal cycle . differential transcription at d <dig> vs l <dig>  d <dig> vs d <dig>  l <dig> vs d <dig>  and l <dig> vs l <dig> varied, ranging from modest changes in the mrna  to extreme induction , whereas the observed protein abundance changed very little in most cases. the few exceptions were fbp <dig> , pgk , gap <dig>  and fba <dig> , as shown in figure  <dig>  for these genes, each of the mrna transcripts and respective proteins increased and decreased more or less in concert with a slight lag for the increase in protein abundance. the discrepancy in the abundance changes of mrna and protein suggests that post-translational regulatory mechanisms play an important role for central metabolism in cyanothece  <dig> 

in the pentose phosphate pathway, the mrna changes are far more striking than those of the proteins. this pathway is used in both the light and the dark and, although the transcripts of many proteins were most abundant in the late dark and early light, the protein levels remained high throughout much of the 24h period. interestingly, transcription of the genes for proteins also used for co <dig> fixation was highest in the mid to late dark, thus preparing the cells for the onset of light-driven photosynthesis. this included the rubisco genes for which the mrna levels increased over 10-fold in the late dark and the protein levels were enhanced by about 2-folld in the late dark and the early light. the genes for the tca cycle were somewhat different, in that the main mrna induction was typically in the daytime and the proteins seemed to be at slightly higher abundance in the light. glycogen/starch metabolism is also represented by a number of different relationships where the proteins remained more stable than the mrna levels would have indicated. the one instance where transcription and translation are in phase is the cpha gene that encodes the cyanophycin synthase. the expression patterns both are highest in the late light and progressively diminish during the dark into the early light. cpha is most needed during and after nitrogen fixation and so a high level at these times is appropriate.

protein expression across genomic elements
another objective was to analyze gene expression across the multiple elements that comprise this relatively complex genome. the genome of cyanothece  <dig> is the largest of the cyanothece strains sequenced to date and is comprised of  <dig>  mb circular chromosome, in addition to  <dig> extra-chromosomal elements, ranging in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb. an overview of how protein expression occurs from each genomic element is presented in table  <dig>  over the  <dig> h time course,  <dig> proteins were expressed with high quantitative reproducibility  from genes located on the main chromosome representing 18% of the presently annotated genes. however, a total of  <dig> proteins from the circular chromosome were identified, at varying levels of quantitative accuracy, which accounted for representation of 31% of the total genes. all of the other genomic elements demonstrated some protein expression and the largest linear plasmid had  <dig> expressed proteins or 9% of the total orfs on this plasmid. this genomic element encodes a number of very large genes and we obtained protein, of a variety of different functions, from  <dig> of these genes. large expressed proteins included: cyan7822_ <dig> with  <dig> aa, which was at much higher levels in the early light. this protein may be involved in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis and could be involved with cyanophycin metabolism. cyan7822_ <dig> encoded a  <dig> aa protein that may be involved with acyl-coa synthesis and expression was highest in the late dark-early light periods. cyan7822_ <dig> was among the largest polypeptides with  <dig>  aa and expression was relatively unchanged throughout the day. this protein has many possible functional domains, but the largest component had homology to outer membrane adhesion-like proteins. cyan7822_ <dig> with  <dig>  aa was expressed with a peak in the dark and had homology to concanavalin a-like lectin or glucanase. this protein does have a potential signal sequence at the n-terminus and may be located in the cytoplasmic membrane, but the remainder of the protein does not have transmembrane segments. in addition, a protein encoded by the 43kb plasmid was also large and upregulated in the light . the large proteins encoded by the chromosome cover many different functions as shown in additional file 7: table s <dig> table  <dig>

anti-sense and crispr expression
the rna-seq experiment provided an opportunity to assess anti-sense rna transcription in cyanothece  <dig>  we know little about the overall importance of anti-sense rna in cyanobacteria, but we can correlate global patterns in the light and dark and in regards to specific genomic elements. anti-sense rna was found throughout the genome, with sizes ranging from ~ <dig> nt to over  <dig> nt. in addition, the anti-sense rna density plot indicated that there were different levels of anti-sense throughout the light–dark cycle and that the amount of anti-sense rna was lowest at d <dig>  in analyzing the anti-sense as a function of genomic elements, the density was somewhat lower on plasmid  <dig>  the  <dig> kb linear plasmid, and lowest on the  <dig> kb plasmid at d <dig>  this relationship was verified by a more detailed statistical analysis as shown in table  <dig>  the main chromosome had a greater percentage of anti-sense rnas than expected, whereas the  <dig> kb plasmid had many fewer anti-sense rnas than expected, based on the total number of anti-sense rnas detected. although we have no direct indication that antisense-transcription regulates any specific cellular processes, the expression of antisense mrna is not equal at the four time points measured. such differences suggest that the antisense rnas are modulated in response to the light–dark cycle and this may indicate a role in diurnal regulation.table  <dig>

one of the most interesting outcomes was the level of expression of specific genes found on this large linear plasmid  <dig> . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> or  <dig> %, are related to crispr activities in the cell. crispr genes have been found in many bacteria and provide them with adaptive sequence-specific nucleic acid restriction mechanisms that act as a defense against invading mobile genetic elements such as bacteriophages, invading plasmids, and transposons . the presence of cripsr genes in cyanothece is not unique to cyanothece  <dig>  in fact, all sequenced cyanothece strains contain at least  <dig> annotated crispr-related genes . for example, cyanothece  <dig> has  <dig> annotated crispr genes on its genome, all of which are located on the main circular chromosome  with none on the linear chromosome or the  <dig> plasmids. in similar fashion, cyanothece sp. atcc  <dig> and cyanothece sp. pcc  <dig> also contain all of their  <dig> or  <dig> crispr genes, respectively, on their main chromosomes. other cyanothece strains, such as cyanothece sp. pcc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contain genes of this nature on both the main chromosome as well on their extra-chromosomal plasmids. cyanothece  <dig> is most interesting because there is a total of  <dig> genes of crispr related functions, but only one gene is found on the main chromosome , whereas  <dig> are found on the large linear plasmid  and  <dig> on the second largest linear plasmid .

discussion
comparison between cyanothece strains
a number of proteomic studies have now been performed on a series of cyanothece strains, including the best studied, cyanothece  <dig>  an intensive proteomic study of cyanothece  <dig> was performed  <cit> , followed by a more detailed analysis of those proteins differentially expressed on cells grown under  <dig> different conditions  <cit> . this later study identified some  <dig> proteins  that were differentially expressed. their results for cells grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions were similar to what was found here for cyanothece  <dig>  one significant difference was that cyanothece  <dig> proteins from genes encoding nitrogen-fixing and photosynthesis proteins were more highly synchronized to either the dark or light, respectively. on the other hand, the results for proteins involved in central metabolism were similar in both organisms.

a number of other cyanobacteria have been analyzed using rna seq including synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> , anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> , microcysits aeruginosa le- <dig>  <cit>  and prochlorococcus med <dig>  <cit> . the prochlorococcus study was fundamentally the most similar to the current study, as it also analyzed proteomic data and obtained samples throughout a light–dark cycle. prochlorococcus is the ocean’s most abundant primary producer and must always live according to the natural diel cycle. analysis of transcriptional patterns demonstrated a substantial amount of light  induced mrna, but the protein levels sometimes differed sharply from that of the mrna. waldbauer et al.  <cit>  analyzed time courses of paired mrna-protein abundances for  <dig> proteins every  <dig> h that represents about 16% of the  <dig> orfs in the genome. this is similar to the overall percentage from cyanothece  <dig> that we studied. in the case of both cyanothece strains analyzed in detail, the closest convergence for mrna and protein were for the nitrogenase cluster in the night—this seems to be critical, since the nif complex is readily degraded by o <dig> that is most prevalent in the light.

another benefit of having paired mrna and protein data is the ability to understand better the relationship of transcription and translation of metabolic pathways that generate intermediates for various targeted products. for example, cyanothece  <dig> has potential to be engineered for butanol production. cyanothece  <dig> possesses at least two pathways for butanol production , via isoleucine biosynthesis and via the crotonyl-coa pathway. isoleucine synthesis in cyanothece  <dig> is similar to that in cyanothece  <dig> and occurs through an alternate citramalate pathway similar to anaerobic bacteria and archaea  <cit> . citramalate is generated through a condensation reaction of pyruvate and acetyl-coa catalyzed by cima then to 2-ketobutyrate and eventually isoleucine. the catalytic actions of the native leuabcd that convert 2-ketobutyrate to 2-ketovalerate, along with the additional actions of a heterologous 2-ketoacid-decarboxylase  and a dehydrogenation reaction, would theoretically allow butanol production. generating butanol via the crotonyl-coa pathway would require inhibition of phb synthesis along with the introduction of two heterologous genes, 3-hydroxybutyryl dehydrogenase  and trans-2-enoyl-coa reductase . since cyanothece is missing these last two genes in the biosynthesis pathway, as well as a 2-keto decarboxylase, it is proposed that the introduction of these  <dig> genes into cyanothece  <dig> would result in the phototrophic production of butanol. this is similar to genetic manipulations in synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig> that led to the production of butanol  <cit>  and isobutyraldehyde  <cit> . in both these pathways, a variety of comparative patterns can be seen, including in-phase and anti-phase. these results indicate that many different relationships occur between sense and antisense transcription and translation in cyanothece  <dig> and that targeting this strain to produce a specific metabolite will require in depth analysis of expression patterns, paying careful attention to the interplay between sense and antisense transcription and their relationship to translation levels.figure  <dig>

while techniques to genetically modify cyanothece  <dig> to carry out these modifications exist, advancements in commandeering the cas <dig> crispr enzyme for genome editing in bacteria could provide an alternative, and possibly, more efficient method  <cit> . cyanothece  <dig> has a cluster of crispr genes on the extra-chromosomal plasmids. these genes display high levels of transcription, yet of the  <dig> genes annotated as being involved in crispr activities that are transcriptionally active, only one was observed in the protein population. while it is unclear what role these active genes are playing in the cell, their activity suggests that the introduction of cas9-based editing tools may be a viable new option that should be pursued further. in addition, it is notable that crispr-like genes are located on the ends of the large plasmid, a fact that allows the speculation that the pressure for maintenance of these extra-chromosomal plasmids is connected to their presumptive anti-viral activity. the reason for the complexity of the cyanothece genomes  <cit>  is unknown, but the possibility of horizontal gene transfer of dna elements, followed by stabilization, is one possibility. the importance of specific gene functions on these introduced elements can be the reason that they have been preserved. we need to study gene expression in cyanothece  <dig> under many different conditions in order to test this general hypothesis and know exactly how these extra chromosomal elements are providing a benefit for the cell and it will be interesting to see if cyanophage that infect any of the cyanothece strains can be identified in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
an understanding of bacterial complexity requires the analysis of the full complement of proteins and the way they are regulated. we have begun this process in cyanothece  <dig> by analyzing transcription and translation across a  <dig> h diurnal period under nitrogen-fixing conditions. overall, the results indicate that:  rna seq and microarray data provide similar information on mrna transcription, although rna seq provides more coverage and higher sensitivity;  although we can obtain complete coverage at the mrna level, the number of proteins identified represents about 25% of all possible gene products;  differential expression at the mrna and protein level can follow the same general pattern or can be quite different. strongly up- or down-regulated genes at the transcriptional level are no guarantee that the proteins will behave similarly;  nonetheless, many proteins involved in key metabolic functions demonstrated expression to a greater extent in either the light or the dark, depending upon the need for that function. the dynamic range of the protein levels under these conditions is typically far less than that shown at the messenger rna level, implying that statements relating to absolute levels of induction/repression at the transcriptional level may not be important at the protein level.
