BACKGROUND
the ordered production and differentiation of cell types that occurs during nervous system  development relies upon tightly regulated gene expression. in neural cells, spatial and temporal gene regulation occurs through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. while the transcriptional networks that direct neural cell fate and govern cell shape, position, and connectivity have been well studied  <cit> , the post-transcriptional influences on neural development and gene expression are less well understood.

at the core of post-transcriptional gene regulation are rna-binding proteins . proteins containing canonical rna-binding domains  are involved in numerous steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic rna processing  <cit> . through mrna capping, splicing, editing, polyadenylation and nonsense-mediated decay, rbps modulate the diversity of transcribed genes  <cit> . rbps also affect the processing of non-coding rnas  <cit> . specific rbps additionally enable asymmetric rna distribution and translational regulation  <cit> , two phenomena that are critical for affecting localized protein synthesis  <cit> .

the importance of post-transcriptional processing in ns gene regulation is underscored by functional examples of specific rbps  <cit> . for instance, the neuronal-specific factor nova- <dig> regulates splicing of pre-mrnas that encode components of inhibitory synapses  <cit> . mice lacking nova- <dig> die postnatally due to aberrant regulation of apoptotic neuronal death  <cit> . as a second example, rbps encoded by the quaking and musashi loci promote glial cell fate  <cit>  and cns stem cell self-renewal  <cit>  by stabilizing transcripts involved in cell differentiation. thirdly, the fragile x mental retardation protein, members of the elav/hu protein family, and the staufen proteins are involved in targeting and translational regulation of dendritic transcripts  <cit> . additionally, the finding that long-term memory requires de novo protein synthesis highlights the significance of post-transcriptional processes in neural function  <cit> .

despite our knowledge of several key rbps, much of the understanding of rbps in the brain comes from studies of adult animals or neural cell lines. thus, how the functional class of rbps contributes to the positioning, growth, and diversification of cells in the developing brain is not well understood. one step towards increasing our understanding rbps is to resolve where they are expressed. here, we utilize the approach of in situ hybridization mapping  <cit>  to investigate the expression of  <dig> rbps within the developing mouse brain. two stages of development were characterized, embryonic day  <dig>  , when critical cellular fate choice decisions are made and postnatal day  <dig> , when the major structural components of the brain are apparent. we find that, in contrast to their proposed ubiquitous involvement in gene regulation, most rbps are not uniformly expressed. the majority of rbps profiled demonstrates spatially restricted expression in the brain or in other peripheral tissues examined. the data presented here and in an online database afford a visual filter for the functional analysis of individual rbps in the developing mammalian ns.

RESULTS
mouse rbps were identified according to gene sequence
the rna recognition motif , the hnrnp k-homology  domain, and the double-stranded rna-binding domain  are evolutionarily conserved, well-characterized domains known to bind either single or double-stranded rna  <cit> . sequence similarity searches and structural analyses of these domains have led to the ability to predict other rbps based on primary coding sequence  <cit> . to identify unique genomic loci that encode putative rbps in the mouse genome, we analyzed existing public  <cit>  and private  <cit>  databases for sequences containing one or more rbd. candidates were classified as rbps only if their predicted protein sequence contained a protein families database -defined rbd  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> genes harboring one or more rrm, kh, or dsrm sequences. we also identified  <dig> genes encoding other domains shown to interact with rna, including the zinc knuckle, g-patch, piwi, dead box rna helicase, and tudor domains. finally, as the absence of a canonical rbd does not preclude interaction with rna, we sought  <dig> additional genes known or predicted to be associated with rna processing. in total, this collection contains  <dig> putative rbps. additional file  <dig> lists the number of genes, per rbd, identified and analyzed by in situ hybridization. a list of all genes and primer sequences is given in additional file  <dig> 

rbp expression in the developing mouse brain was analyzed by in situ hybridization
to localize rbp expression, we preformed in situ hybridization on whole head tissue sections of e <dig>  embryos and p <dig> mice. we designed gene-specific primers to produce 400â€“ <dig> bp probes for  <dig> candidate rbps. these primer sets were used to perform pcr on cdna prepared from embryonic or p <dig> mouse brains. a small number of probes were obtained from mouse intestine, liver, kidney, or testes cdna.  <dig> genes  showed positive pcr products . following subcloning, anti-sense digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes were prepared and hybridized against coronal head and transverse upper-body sections . digital images of the entire in situ hybridization set have been deposited in the mahoney rna-binding protein expression database  <cit> .

rbps exhibit restricted expression in the developing mouse brain
several neural-specific rbps have been identified, yet how many others demonstrate this degree of specificity is unknown. of the genes examined we found  <dig> rbps  that exhibit ns-restricted expression in the tissues analyzed. among this list are known examples of neuronal-specific rbps including nova- <dig>  <cit> , the elav/hu proteins b, c, and d  <cit> , and ataxin  <dig> binding protein  <dig>   <cit>  but additionally include putative rbps for which expression has not been reported. with the exception of one gene that was only detected at e <dig> , all  of these rbps appear brain or ns-specific at both developmental stages in the tissues analyzed. overall, these rbp encoding genes are not limited in expression to one brain region but are found in multiple brain or ns structures.

rbps show spatially restricted expression in anatomically distinct brain regions
we find that greater than half of the rbps profiled exhibit spatially restricted expression. of the  <dig> genes examined,  <dig> demonstrate localized, enriched expression in one or more discrete brain regions in addition to detectable expression in non-ns tissues. we divided the e <dig>  and p <dig> cns into five and eight general areas for annotation, respectively: the e <dig>  precortical area, the striatum , the periventrical areas, hindbrain, and spinal cord, as well as the p <dig> cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. the presence or absence of expression for each rbp was analyzed visually at each location and is annotated in additional file  <dig>  very few of the  <dig> rbps with spatially restricted expression patterns were expressed in only one brain region, however most  showed restricted expression at both developmental stages .

we observe multiple rbps that demonstrate region-specific expression in the e <dig>  ventricular areas. shown in figure  <dig> are representative rbp genes that are transcribed in mitotically-active cells in the neuroepithelia of the developing telencephalon. among the rbps expressed in this region occupied by neural progenitor cells, we find examples of mrna export factors in addition to putative splicing factors and transcriptional regulators . in all instances, expression in the embryonic lateral ventricular zone is accompanied by expression in the periventricular areas of the 3rd and 4th e <dig>  ventricles and often by heightened expression in the p <dig> subventricular zone  <cit> . notably, we observed this pattern of expression for the dsrm-containing musashi proteins  <cit> . our results are consistent with the documented expression of msi <dig> and msi <dig>  <cit> .

multiple rbps show restricted expression in post-mitotic regions of embryonic brain. presented in figure  <dig> are examples of four putative rbps that demonstrate region-specific expression in areas containing post-mitotic neurons. transcripts of the genes encoding the rrm protein brunol <dig> and the predicted zinc-knuckle protein 1500031h04rik appear pan-neuronal at both developmental stages . expression of the rrm-containing riken gene 4930565a <dig> is most pronounced in the ventral telencephalon, while d11bwg0517e is found in the precortical layer, the thalamic area and hindbrain . among the genes that occupy post-mitotic regions of the developing brain we additionally observe members of the elav/hu family as well as other rbps that have well-documented neuronal expression  <cit> .

rbps demonstrate cell-type specific expression in the p <dig> mouse retina
as our in situ hybridization analyses were performed on sections through whole head, we were able to visualize rbp expression in the developing retina. the vertebrate retina provides a distinctive system for studying cns development as its seven major neural cell types are readily distinguished from one another by their morphology and laminar position  <cit> . shown in figure  <dig> are examples of the diversity of rbp expression in the p <dig> retina. the rrm-containing a2bp <dig> is expressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer , which contains primarily retinal ganglion cells and a small number of displaced amacrine cells . the kh-domain encoding gene poly binding protein  <dig>  shows dramatically enriched expression in the inner nuclear layer  , possibly indicating localization to the bipolar neuron cell bodies that occupy the scleral portion of the inl. notably, both a2bp <dig> and pcbp <dig> show restricted expression in post-mitotic regions of the e <dig>  and p <dig> brain  <cit> . transcripts of the rrm-encoding scaffold attachment factor b  and of the three-rrm containing spoc gene rbm <dig> are expressed in the outer neuroblastic layer of the retina . safb, but not rbm <dig>  is additionally expressed in the gcl, possibly in the mÃ¼ller glia. both safb and rbm <dig> show enriched expression in neuroepithelia of the ventricular zone .

a systems-based view of rbp expression
gene regulation by rbps is believed to occur through coordinated, combinatorial interactions with rna. during the course of this study we identified multiple rbps that are coordinately expressed in the brain and other tissues. we find  <dig> genes  that show elevated expression in proliferating areas of the embryonic and postnatal brain as well as in postnatal nasal epithelia, teeth, and thymus. presented in figure  <dig> are expression data for snrnp e and son, two representative examples of this "synexpression group" of genes that share a similar, complex pattern of expression. further examples are shown in additional file  <dig>  this same expression distribution has been observed for the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, ptbp <dig>  and our data are consistent with previous findings  <cit> . notably, the protein products of many of the genes listed are understood to interact either physically or genetically.

rbps show restricted expression in non-ns tissues
as our analyses were performed on whole head and upper thoracic tissues, our data provide detailed information about rbp expression in developing cranial facial tissues. we identified putative rbps that display tissue-restricted expression in non-ns structures . figure  <dig> presents in situ hybridization results for two rrm-encoding transcripts that show highly restricted expression in different epithelial tissues. the riken gene 2210008m <dig> is transcribed in epithelia covering the facial skeleton , while the gene bc <dig> is expressed in the choroid plexus  and in the lining of the intestine and placenta .

discussion
neural cells utilize multiple forms of post-transcriptional gene regulation. while rbps are believed to be potent modulators of post-transcriptional processes, little is known about how this functional class is expressed in the developing brain. as a first step towards increasing our knowledge of rbps we chose to investigate the spatial and temporal expression of genes that encode motifs known to interact with rna. we find a small set of rbps that show neural-specific expression in the tissues analyzed. an even greater number of rbp genes however demonstrate spatially restricted expression in distinct regions of the developing brain.

within the cns, most of the rbps examined show non-uniform, heightened expression in anatomically discrete structures. tissue differences in the expression levels of individual genes could indicate distinctive protein requirements among cell types, beyond that of tissue-specific rbps  <cit> . there is precedent for differential requirements of individual rbps, as tissue-specific rna splicing is achieved partly through combinatorial, stoichiometric differences among splicing factors within various cells  <cit> . it is from this local enrichment within different cell types or tissues that we can begin to hypothesize as to the functional significance of individual genes as well as to the importance of groups of similarly expressed rbps.

our study has identified rbps that display spatially restricted expression in distinct regions of the developing mouse brain. one set of rbps  is found in the e <dig>  ventricular areas. a second set demonstrates spatially restricted expression in post-mitotic regions of e <dig>  brain . based on their pattern of expression, these rbps may have roles in neural proliferation, cell fate choice and cell migration, or in neuronal function, respectively. we also identified novel rbps that are expressed in tissues of mesodermal and endodermal origin . the highly restricted expression of these genes may indicate an explicit role for these rbps in their respective epithelia. additionally, the cell-type specificity rbps found in the p <dig> retina  illustrates the diversity of rbp expression. the specialized expression of these rbps may be indicative of a dedicated function in the specified tissues.

by visual inspection of in situ hybridization data, we find a subset of rbps that are coordinately expressed in multiple tissue types. these genes display heightened expression in the periventricular areas of the e <dig>  brain and spinal cord as well as marked expression in the external granule layer of the p <dig> cerebellum, the lateral subventricular zones, and in teeth, nasal epithelia, and thymus . while not excluded from post-mitotic tissues, these rbps are predominately expressed in structures that are undergoing cell division.

notably, the term 'synexpression group' has been used to describe collections of genes that function in a common process and share a similar complex spatial expression pattern in multiple tissues  <cit> . among the synexpression group identified here we find examples of rbps that are known to interact either physically or genetically . for example, ptbp <dig> binds the splicing factors psf  <cit>  and hnrnp l  <cit>  while sf2/asf and hnrnp a <dig> select for 5' exon or exclusion or inclusion, respectively  <cit> . our data provide visual support to a growing body of evidence that functionally-related transcripts are post-transcriptionally co-regulated  <cit> .

although the significance of certain splicing and mrna export factor enrichment in proliferating regions is not known, data from multiple studies point to a role for rbps in cell proliferation. during hippocampal development expression levels of rbps were found to be high and then to dramatically decrease, as neurons transition from a proliferating to a post-mitotic state  <cit> . a number of rbps were also identified as highly expressed in a molecular characterization of gastric epithelial progenitor cells  <cit> . furthermore, protein levels of hnrnps and snrnps were found to be down-regulated upon stimulated growth inhibition of myeloid cells  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that a role for rbps during cell proliferation and cell fate determination exists in multiple tissue types.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the data presented here provide new insight into how a distinct functional gene class is expressed in the developing ns. we find that rbps demonstrate region-specific as well as cell-type specific expression. in addition, we find that specific, proliferating regions of the embryonic and postnatal ns and peripheral tissues are similar in the expression of certain rbps. these data serve as a starting point for functional investigations into the roles of rbps in neural development and physiology.
