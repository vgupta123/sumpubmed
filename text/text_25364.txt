BACKGROUND
vibrio vulnificus , a halophilic gram-negative bacillus, causes a serious inflammatory process involving primary septicaemia and soft tissue infections  <cit> . patients with v. vulnificus infections have been reported in northern europe, the united states, australia, and taiwan  <cit> . in the u.s., approximately  <dig> confirmed cases of v. vulnificus are reported per year, most of which occur in the gulf coast region. the first case was reported in taiwan in  <dig>  and the number of reported infections has increased because of greater disease activity or improved recognition by clinicians  <cit> . considerable data on the epidemiology of v. vulnificus has been obtained from taiwan over the past two decades, and the involvement of environmental conditions, host factors, and bacterial virulence factors has led to a clearer understanding of the correlation between v. vulnificus infections and clinical manifestations. numerous studies on v. vulnificus have investigated virulence factors, such as iron-overloading  <cit>  and inflammation-associated cytokine production  <cit> . v. vulnificus surface structures, such as lipopolysaccharide  and capsular polysaccharides, increase cytokine production  <cit> . further, overproduction and dysregulation of the host cytokine response to v. vulnificus, including tumour necrosis factor -α, interleukin - <dig>  and other inflammatory mediators, are critical in v. vulnificus-related endotoxaemic shock and lead to high mortality  <cit> . however, the mechanisms of v. vulnificus-initiated signal transduction for these proinflammatory cytokines remain unclear.

macrophage migration inhibitory factor , an important proinflammatory cytokine, is a critical mediator of innate immunity and is implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis  <cit> . innate immune cells, including activated t cells, macrophages, and eosinophils, are the primary sites of mif production after the host has been exposed to bacterial endotoxins and exotoxins. the released mif modulates the expression of proinflammatory mediators, leading to early death in patients with sepsis  <cit> . in mice, the close linkage between mif expression and gram-negative and gram-positive septic shock strongly suggests an intrinsic role for mif in the innate immune response. additionally, deleting the mif gene or immunoneutralising mif attenuates tnf-α production and protects against endotoxic shock  <cit> . the molecular mechanism of mif inhibition in decreasing deleterious cytokine activity during sepsis is currently under investigation. mif-deficient macrophages are hypo-responsive to stimulation by lps and gram-negative bacteria because of a defect in toll-like receptor  <dig> signalling and protein expression  <cit> . these findings show that mif is important in innate immunity and provide a rationale for the development of an anti-mif strategy to treat patients with gram-negative septic shock. the tautomerase active site of mif has been proposed  <cit>  as a potential target for mif-modulating proinflammatory cytokines and might be used as a novel anti-inflammatory agent. isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester , an inhibitor of mif d-dopachrome tautomerase activity, has been shown to inhibit tnf-α secretion from lps-treated macrophages and to protect mice from endotoxaemic  <cit> . the importance of iso-1-mediated inhibition of the mif catalytic site in the suppression of cytokine proinflammatory activity suggests that the effect of iso- <dig> requires endogenous mif.

mif binds to the cd74-cd <dig> complex and induces a signalling cascade that leads to activation of downstream signalling molecules, cellular proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis by activating the akt pathway through the upstream proteins src and pi3k kinase  <cit> . nuclear factor-kappa b  and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  are also critical intracellular signal transduction molecules involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis  <cit> . nf-κb, a ubiquitous transcription factor, is responsible for the transcription of a diverse range of genes involved in sepsis and is a critical regulator of genes that encode tnf-α, il- <dig>  chemokines, and other inducible enzymes  <cit> . as with nf-κb, p <dig> mapk has been implicated as a critical mediator of the release of these proinflammatory cytokines during sepsis, and inhibiting p <dig> mapk has an anti-inflammatory effect both in mice and in human endotoxaemic  <cit> . it was recently reported  <cit>  that mif induced the expression of tnf-related apoptosis, inducing ligand and monocyte chemoattractant protein  <dig> in human diabetic podocytes, and that this mif-induced expression is also p <dig> mapk dependent. we investigated the effects of mif and its molecular actions on proinflammatory cytokine production in v. vulnificus infection.

methods
bacterial strains and media
a clinical isolate of encapsulated v. vulnificus, chi-mei vv <dig>  was obtained from the chi-mei medical center  and was prepared as previously reported  <cit> . a single colony was chosen and cultured at 35°c overnight in freshly prepared mueller-hinton broth. the bacterial suspension  was then diluted 1: <dig> in mueller-hinton broth and incubated under the same conditions for  <dig> h. bacteria were collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min at 24°c. pellets were resuspended and diluted to an inoculum with a final bacterial concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> colony-forming units /ml  before it was injected into mice or co-cultured with human whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells . the inoculum concentration was confirmed by the subsequent growth of the concurrent culture on agar plates.

mice
inbred balb/c female mice  were purchased from the animal center, national science council, taipei, taiwan. they were allowed to acclimatise for  <dig> to  <dig> days in the animal research laboratory of the chi-mei medical center. food and water were supplied ad libitum. the experimental protocol adhered to the rules of the animal protection act of taiwan and was approved by the laboratory animal care and use committee of the chi-mei medical center.

preparing human cells
buffy coats from healthy blood donors were obtained both from the chi-mei medical center and from the national cheng kung university hospital. pbmcs were isolated by ficoll-hypaque gradient centrifugation  and prepared at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in rpmi. blood was taken with informed consent from healthy volunteers in accordance with a protocol approved by the human experiment and ethics committees of both hospitals.

measuring cytokine concentration
infected mice were killed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after they had been intraperitoneally inoculated with the vv <dig> strain of v. vulnificus. serum samples obtained from the left axillary artery were stored at -80°c until they were assayed. in the infected human-cell model, the bacterial suspensions were added to whole blood or pbmcs at multiplicities of infection  from  <dig> to  <dig>  at designated times, plasma or supernatants were collected for analysis using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays . to determine the concentrations of cytokines, elisa kits including mif , il- <dig> , il- <dig>  and tnf-α , were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

inhibitors of mif, p <dig> mapk, nf-κb, and akt
the mif inhibitor -3-- <dig> -dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester  was obtained from merck kgaa, . neutralising antibodies against human mif and control goat igg were purchased from r&d systems. sb <dig>  pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , and ly <dig> and wortmannin, selective inhibitors of p <dig> mapk, nf-κb, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/akt, respectively, were purchased from tocris bioscience . all drug treatments were assessed for cytotoxic effects using cytotoxicity and viability assays. doses determined to be harmless were used.

western blotting
we harvested the cells and lysed them with a buffer containing 1% triton x- <dig>   <dig> mm tris ,  <dig> mm ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ,  <dig> % nan <dig>  and a protease inhibitor cocktail . after they had been freeze-thawed once, the cell lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 4°c for  <dig> min. the supernatants were then collected and boiled in sample buffer for  <dig> min. after they were separated using sds-page, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride  membranes , blocked at 4°c overnight in pbs-t  containing 5% skim milk, and probed with primary antibodies at 4°c overnight. after they had been washed with pbs-t, the blots were incubated with a 1: <dig> dilution of horseradish peroxide -conjugated secondary antibody at 4°c for  <dig> h. the protein bands were visualised using enhanced chemiluminescence  , and the relative signal intensity was quantified using densitometry . the extents of iκb, akt, and p <dig> mapk activation were determined using antibodies against phosphorylation .

electrophoretic mobility shift assays 
nuclear extracts from human pbmcs were prepared using a method, with minor modifications, described elsewhere  <cit> . the cells were washed with  <dig> ml of phosphate-buffered saline  and resuspended in  <dig> ml of pbs. the cells were then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min, and the supernatant was discarded. the cell pellet was incubated in  <dig> μl of buffer a  on ice for  <dig> min and then gently shaken for  <dig> s. the pellet of the crude nuclei was collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> s, resuspended in  <dig> μl of buffer c  using a vortexer for  <dig> s, and then incubated on ice for  <dig> min. after the cells had been centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min, the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was collected, quantified , and stored in aliquots at -70°c. the emsa used the following oligonucleotides as probes:

nf-κ b : 5'-caa atg tgg gat ttt ccc atg agt;

RESULTS
mif was expressed before il- <dig> and tnf-α in v. vulnificus-infected mice
blood samples from balb/c mice were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after they had been infected with v. vulnificus, and the concentrations of the serum cytokines mif, il- <dig>  and tnf-α were determined. serum mif peaked  <dig> h post-infection and then declined ; il- <dig> and tnf-α  continuously increased. because our results showed that mif increased earlier than il- <dig> and tnf-α, we hypothesised that the early presence of serum mif acts as an upstream enhancer or modulator of other proinflammatory cytokines, especially il- <dig>  during v. vulnificus infection. iso- <dig>  an mif tautomerase inhibitor, was used to observe the effect of mif inhibition on cytokine production in v. vulnificus-infected mice. inhibition of mif decreased v. vulnificus-induced production of il- <dig> and tnf-α .

mif was an upstream modulator of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α
we next examined the effect of mif inhibition on the production of the proinflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α in v. vulnificus-infected human whole blood and isolated pbmcs. to inhibit mif, pbmcs were pre-treated with iso- <dig> for  <dig> min before they were infected with v. vulnificus. il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  concentrations were reduced in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the plasma of infected human whole blood and in the supernatant of infected pbmcs. however, the concentrations of tnf-α were inhibited unless the cells were pretreated with high doses of iso- <dig> . moreover, different mois  showed the same trends of iso- <dig> inhibition on il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α . we also confirmed that v. vulnificus infection induced mif production in a time-dependent manner in infected whole blood and isolated pbmcs . tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> were downregulated in v. vulnificus-infected pbmcs treated with neutralising antibodies to inhibit mif . taken together, these results show that mif regulated the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α during v. vulnificus infection.

nf-κb and p <dig> mapk signalling were essential for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α production
we examined whether mif-induced production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α was regulated by interfering with intracellular signal transduction. the concentrations of il- <dig> , il- <dig> , and tnf-α  were significantly lower in v. vulnificus-infected human pbmcs treated with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate  and sb <dig>  but not in pbmcs treated with ly <dig> or wortmannin . these results indicate that nf-κb and p <dig> mapk, but not akt, are important for modulating il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α during v. vulnificus infection.

mif facilitated nf-κb activation
both nf-κb and p <dig> mapk are essential mediators of the response of inflammatory cytokines to either gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial sepsis  <cit> . we next examined whether mif modulated nf-κb- or p <dig> mapk-dependent signalling transduction during v. vulnificus-induced proinflammatory activation. western blotting showed that the phosphorylation of iκb was lower in iso-1-treated v. vulnificus-infected human pbmcs ; however, p <dig> mapk phosphorylation was not lower . these results suggested that mif is an upstream modulator of nf-κb-dependent signalling for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α production during v. vulnificus infection.

nf-κb was essential for the transcriptional activation of mif-induced il- <dig> expression
because nf-κb is an important transcription factor for il- <dig> expression and binds to its response element on the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> , we examined whether increased nf-κb binding activity upregulates il- <dig> in v. vulnificus-infected human pbmcs. we used emsa with probes containing the putative nf-κb binding site on the il- <dig> promoter to measure nf-κb binding activity. after the pbmcs had been infected with v. vulnificus, nf-κb binding was higher in control cells than in pbmcs treated with iso- <dig> . rt-pcr and real-time rt-pcr showed that il- <dig> mrna levels were lower in v. vulnificus-infected pbmcs treated with iso- <dig> than in those not treated with iso- <dig> . taken together, these results suggest that mif is crucial upregulator of il- <dig> at the transcription level in v. vulnificus-infected cells and that this upregulation is the result of nf-κb activation.

discussion
in this study, we showed that mif regulated the production of tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in v. vulnificus-infected human pbmcs, which is consistent with the findings of other studies  <cit> . high serum levels of il- <dig>  a crucial immunoregulator in patients with early-phase gram-negative sepsis, predict poor outcomes for patients with sepsis  <cit> . il- <dig> increases at early time points in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock  <cit> . il- <dig> also is induced in human intestinal epithelial cells infected with v. vulnificus, and il- <dig> mrna expression increases as the result of nf-κb activation  <cit> . in the present study, we provide evidence that mif upregulates il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α in cells infected with v. vulnificus. we hypothesise that mif is an initial proinflammatory mediator during v. vulnificus infection, which is consistent with previous reports  <cit>  on patients with sepsis and endotoxaemic models.

we showed that v. vulnificus infection significantly increased il- <dig> mrna expression and nf-κb binding in human pbmcs. we also showed that v. vulnificus infection increased il- <dig> gene expression via nf-κb activation in human pbmcs and that iso- <dig>  a small molecule inhibitor of mif, downregulated the transcription of il- <dig> and nf-κb activation. while iso- <dig> has a different effect on toll-like receptor 4-induced inflammatory responses  <cit> , our findings indicate that il- <dig> gene expression is regulated by mif activation of nf-κb. although v. vulnificus infection induced mif-regulated proinflammatory cytokines, only high-dose treatments of iso- <dig> inhibited tnf-α production, which indicated that an mif-independent signalling pathway might exist for regulating tnf-α during v. vulnificus infection.

in the present study, we found that the p <dig> mapk and nf-κb pathways were the major signalling pathways through which cytokine release was induced in human pbmcs infected with v. vulnificus. furthermore, a recent study  <cit>  reported that p <dig> mapk was essential for group b streptococcus-induced myd88-dependent induction of tnf-α production but was unnecessary for nf-κb activation  <cit> . however, based on our findings, it appears that v. vulnificus-induced il- <dig> production is facilitated by mif via nf-κb activation but not by p <dig> mapk. the different responses and their molecular mechanisms need further investigation.

inhibiting mif with iso- <dig> downregulated the phosphorylation of iκb and partially inhibited nf-κb binding activity and the mrna expression of il- <dig>  which suggested that mif is an important upregulator of il- <dig> production via nf-κb activation. although the iso-1-mediated downregulation of nf-κb binding and il- <dig> mrna expression was less significant than the downregulation of il- <dig> production, the discrepancy between the upregulation of transcription and protein production suggests that these processes are controlled by different mechanisms. in our preliminary studies, we found a significant decrease in protein production after iso- <dig> treatment in both the intracellular and extracellular phases. however, the mechanism that iso- <dig> uses to inhibit intracellular protein production is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that mif significantly upregulated il- <dig> production by facilitating nf-κb activation in human pbmcs infected with v. vulnificus. these data may help in the development of strategies to target mif with specific inhibitors or neutralising antibodies when treating v. vulnificus infection.
