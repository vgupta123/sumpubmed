BACKGROUND
the human gene sybl <dig>  expression is finely regulated at different layers. even if located in the xq/yq pseudoautosomal region, sybl <dig> is subject to છ inactivation  <cit>  and its allelic expression is controlled by multiple epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> . moreover, sybl <dig> expression is altered in human pathologies characterized by dna methylation derangement  <cit> , such as icf syndrome  <cit>  and hyperhomocysteinemia  <cit> . sybl <dig> encodes the v-snare protein vamp <dig>  an important modulator of intracellular trafficking also known as tetanus neurotoxin insensitive vamp   <cit> . soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors  of the vesicle  and the target membrane  are crucial to intracellular membrane fusion and protein and lipid traffic in eukaryotes  <cit> . since the hydrophobic heptad register of their α-helical coiled-coil region  is interrupted at the so-called "zero layer" by a conserved r or q residue, they are often referred to as r- or q-snares, respectively  <cit> . snares can significantly vary in sequence length  because of their modular domain architecture. in addition to snare motifs they can show further regions, such a carboxy -terminal transmembrane region, motifs allowing post-translational addition of lipid anchors  <cit>  and a variable or conserved amino -terminal domain. the n-terminal longin domain  of longins  <cit>  was found to play multiple regulatory roles . longins are the only r-snares conserved in all eukaryotes, whereas brevins are limited to bilateria and hence are absent from whole taxa   <cit> . longins group into three subfamilies, prototyped by ykt <dig>  sec22b and vamp <dig>  <cit> . in yeast, the ld of ykt6p can regulate membrane fusion by inhibiting ykt6p participation to the fusion bundle, by competitive intramolecular binding to the snare motif  <cit> . the ld of vamp <dig> also regulates membrane fusion; furthermore, it is crucial to neurite outgrowth, as overexpression of a "deregulated" fragment missing the ld  increases neurite outgrowth whereas reverse effect  is obtained when expressing the ld alone  <cit> . in addition to regulating membrane fusion, lds serve as a dominant signal for subcellular targeting. for example, in animals ld targets vamp <dig> to late endosomes by binding to the δ-subunit of the ap- <dig> complex  <cit> . in plants, several vamp <dig> proteins are targeted to their different subcellular localizations by their lds  <cit> . the ld targets ykt <dig> to its subcellular localization, likely by masking other localization signals  <cit> . in sec22b, export from the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by binding to sec23/ <dig>  a process depending on a conformational epitope created by intramolecular ld-snare motif binding; such binding also results in preventing promiscuous, unspecific binding by sequestering the n-terminal half of the snare motif  <cit> . also vamp <dig> adopts a closed conformation based on intramolecular ld-snare motif binding  <cit> . hrb, a clathrin adaptor and arfgap, binds the ld of vamp <dig> by its unstructured snare-like motif, outcompeting the snare motif of vamp <dig> for the same groove and suggesting that hrb-mediated endocytosis of vamp <dig> occurs only when this longin is incorporated into a cis-snare complex  <cit> . vamp <dig> has been found to also interact with the positive regulator of neurite growth varp, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor  of the small gtpase rab <dig> and a binding partner of rab  <dig> and rab  <dig>  <cit> .

like other highly regulated processes typical of eukaryotic cells, subcellular trafficking needs fine tuning of protein functions and structures. modulation of domain architecture and creation or deletion of sequence motifs can in turn be achieved by alternative splicing : this way, a relatively large proteome can be created starting from a limited number of genes  <cit> . indeed, as has been shown to occur in several trafficking-related genes, including snare genes, resulting in the production of isoforms with different subcellular localization and trafficking properties. developmentally regulated as of snap- <dig> and snap- <dig> modulates interactions with accessory factors and subcellular localization  <cit> ; as also regulates interaction properties in the large t-snare family of syntaxins, by varying their n-terminal and/or c-terminal regions  <cit> . in r-snares, as can finely tune vesicle subcellular targeting by varying the extreme c-terminal region in splice variants of vamp <dig>  <cit> , and tissue-specific as of mammalian tomosyn is involved in the regulation of neuronal secretion  <cit> . in most eukaryotes, the involvement of vamp <dig> in multiple trafficking events at different subcellular compartments is mediated by gene amplification and variation  <cit> . in mammals, vamp <dig> is encoded by a single gene and yet it regulates multiple subcellular pathways  <cit> : hence, as is a likely strategy to achieve such complexity in regulation. thus, we have started investigation on longins  by a thorough analysis for the occurrence of as at the human gene sybl <dig> 

RESULTS
exon skipping at the sybl <dig> locus results in modulating isoform domain architecture
human gene sybl <dig> is composed of eight exons, spanning a genomic region of approximately  <dig> kb  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that its genomic structure is intriguingly related to the domain architecture of vamp <dig> : the ld is encoded by exons  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas exons  <dig> to  <dig> encode the helical domains . within the literature two as variants of vamp <dig> have been described, the main isoform vamp7a  and a variant, vamp7c, missing part of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> . we identified isoform vamp7b, missing exon  <dig>  during the screening of a cdna library  <cit> . we deposited the rna and protein sequences into database  and the characterization is reported in this work. database searches allowed us to identify est clone aw <dig>  likely corresponding to an uncharacterized splice variant missing exon  <dig>  hereafter called vamp7d. we then performed rt-pcr to unravel as at the sybl <dig> locus. preliminary experiments with primers pairing to the untranslated regions of the gene amplified multiple fragments , the longest of which corresponding to vamp7a; we found no intron retention, suggesting as of sybl <dig> is based on exon skipping. this prompted us to set up more specific and resolutive experiments, investigating 5' and 3' sybl <dig> splicing events separately.

exon skipping at the 5' half of the gene results in synaptobrevin-like, "non-longin" isoforms
we first examined as at the 5' end of the sybl <dig> locus and identified three isoforms, "c", "d" and "h", that would disrupt production of the longin domain . as at ld-codifying exons was firstly screened with the forward primer including the canonical atg codon of the sybl <dig> gene. three bands smaller than isoform "a" were sequenced, of which one confirmed the bioinformatically captured isoform "d" missing exon  <dig>  the two other bands resulted from the use of a cryptic gt donor splice site inside exon  <dig> joined to the ag acceptor splice site of either exon  <dig>  or exon  <dig> . in order to characterize the 3' architecture of each isoform, we used an "allele specific oligonucleotide" pcr  approach  <cit> . aso-c, aso-d and aso-h forward primers anneal specifically only to c- or d- or h-like isoforms , completely abolishing any other splice-molecule influence. each of these aso primers was combined to a common reverse primer specific to sybl1-exon  <dig>  performing four different sets of rt-pcr with cdnas from different tissues and cell lines . we could conclude that "non-longin" isoforms - i.e. splice variants missing the ld - retain all the canonical exons from  <dig> to  <dig> , but with different consequences on the reading frame. vamp7c was already described: the splicing event skips out  <dig> residues of the n-terminal region , but the mrna retains the original reading frame, leading to the correct translation of the "synaptobrevin-like" part of the sequence   <cit> . translation of both vamp7d and vamp7h mrnas would result in short peptides  when starting from the canonical translation initiation start  of sybl <dig>  which is located in exon  <dig>  however, scanning of the sybl <dig> sequence  identified a second, alternative tis in exon  <dig>  showing "optimal status" with respect to sequence context and distance from the upstream stop codons to reinitiate translation . such translation reinitiation mechanism is well-known in homo sapiens and it allows for producing alternative, functional proteins from mrnas which would otherwise originate only short peptides when using only the canonical tis  <cit> . since the alternative tis in exon  <dig> is common to "d" and "h" isoforms, both mrnas are likely to produce by translation reinitiation the same polypeptide, hence named "vamp7d/h". intriguingly, vamp7d/h, corresponding to last  <dig> residues of vamp7a, lacks the ld and consists only of the snare motif, transmembrane region and intravesicular tail, possibly representing a physiological equivalent of the "Δ-longin" recombinant vamp <dig> construct enhancing membrane fusion and neurite outgrowth when expressed in neurons  <cit> .

skipping of sybl <dig> exons  <dig> and/or  <dig> produces non-snare, ld protein isoforms
examining the 3' end of the gene we identified three splice variants, "b", "i" and "j" that result in proteins containing the ld but not the snare motif . such non-snare isoforms - characterized by skipping of respectively:  exon  <dig> ,  exon  <dig>  and  both exons  - show different domain architectures possibly underlying different cellular roles. vamp7b is  <dig> amino acids longer than vamp7a and it shares with the main isoform the ld and n-terminal part of the snare motif. then, a frameshift downstream of exon  <dig> results in substitution of both the c-terminal half of the snare motif and the transmembrane region by a novel c-terminal region of  <dig> amino acids. on the other hand, vamp7i basically consists of the ld alone: exons  <dig> to  <dig> encode for the first  <dig> residues of vamp <dig>  including all secondary structure elements needed to achieve a complete ld fold . skipping of exon  <dig> then results in a frameshift that leads to the translation of just two additional residues, followed by a premature stop codon. as for vamp7j, it is a kind of "membrane-anchored version" of vamp7i: skipping of both exons  <dig> and  <dig> preserves the original frame in which the ld is followed by a short hinge region preceding the original transmembrane and intravesicular tail regions, shared with the main isoform. multiple skipping of exons  <dig> to  <dig> was found to result in a number of putative additional isoforms; however, multi-exon skipping often derives from splicing errors instead of programmed as and "false" isoforms can be recognized by quite low expression levels  <cit> . therefore, we performed semi-quantitative and quantitative rt-pcr screens and expression levels of these putative isoforms were found to be less than  <dig> %  of the main isoform, as reported for splicing errors  <cit> . even though the existence of further isoforms cannot be excluded, assays performed so far show that as at the sybl <dig> locus results in the production of seven isoforms with varying domain architecture .

quantitative expression and tissue specific distribution of vamp7/ti-vamp isoforms
real-time rt-pcr was performed on a panel of human cell lines and tissues, in order to obtain amplicons specific to vamp <dig> isoforms . figure  <dig> summarizes quantitative expression data. the upper graph illustrates relative contributions to the mrna pool from vamp7a  and alternative splice variants . vamp7a contribution to the mrna pool amounts to 60-70% in cell lines  and 40-60% in tissues ; in three out of five tissues, the sum of alternative variants  overpass 50% of the vamp <dig> mrna. the central graph illustrates the mrna levels of single isoforms; splice variants range 5-12% of vamp7a in cell lines, while their levels are much higher in tissues. for instance, in colon  the aggregate level of vamp7i+j mrnas is comparable to vamp7a and in skeletal muscle  vamp7i alone is comparable to the main isoform. in pie charts, 100% refers to the mrna pool of alternative variants, excluding vamp7a. preponderance of ld+, non-snare isoforms  is apparent in cell lines and it becomes more evident in tissues, where their aggregate level is comparable or even higher than that of vamp7a. in particular, the non-snare/snare isoform ratio can shift from approximately 1: <dig> in cell lines to up 3: <dig> in tissues. in most tissues and cell lines, the second most expressed isoform  is vamp7j, which is highly expressed in colon. the level of alternative variants in neuroblastoma cells  and fetal brain  is lower than that found in adult brain , where the expression of vamp7a is high .

immunodetection of isoforms by domain-specific oligoclonal antibodies
in order to get evidence on isoforms at protein level, oligoclonal antibodies were made to regions of vamp7: md <dig> recognizes just the ld, md <dig> the c-terminal half of the snare motif, md <dig> and md <dig> the alternative non-snare c-terminal region of vamp7b . specificity of each antibody was checked  and confirmed by complete absence of non specific recognition, even at high concentration ; md <dig> and md <dig> yielded a stronger signal than md <dig> and md <dig>  for immunoblotting experiments, two identical series of protein samples were separated by sds-page, blotted and incubated with antibodies specific to the ld and snare motif of vamp <dig>  or to the unique c-terminal region of vamp7b . in extracts from bacteria expressing vamp <dig> fragments, md2+md <dig> recognized bands of the expected mr of gst-cytoplasmic domain of vamp7a  and of thioredoxin-ld ; md4+md <dig> recognized only the band corresponding to thioredoxin-c-terminal region of vamp7b . specificity was confirmed by the fact that no band could be seen in control extracts from bacteria expressing the empty plasmids . specificity of md4+md <dig> antibodies was expected to be high also when using human cell extracts, because exhaustive scanning of the human genome failed to find sequences with significant similarity to the c-terminal region of vamp7b. such prediction was confirmed by the fact that among endogenous human proteins , md4+md <dig> recognized a single band of approximately  <dig> kda . as expected, md2+md <dig> identified a main band of approximately  <dig> kda  and the  <dig> kda band corresponding to vamp7b . recognition of vamp7b by both antibody panels is in agreement with md <dig> specificity to the ld, shared by isoforms "a" and "b". intensities of the two  <dig> kda bands are also in agreement with relative strengths of the antibodies . moreover, relative intensities of the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda bands in lane  <dig>  are in agreement with higher expression of the main isoform . given that md2+md <dig> are expected to weakly recognize all splice variants reported here, additional bands in lane  <dig>  are likely to correspond to other isoforms. in particular, the two bands in between  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda markers are compatible with expected mr of vamp7c  and vamp7j  and the band slightly over the  <dig> kda marker might correspond to vamp7d/h . to better identify the minor bands, the same sample  was investigated using md <dig> and md <dig> antibodies separately . as expected, md <dig>  recognized - in addition to vamp7a  and vamp7b  bands - the  <dig> kda band likely corresponding to vamp7j. md <dig> did not recognize the bands of ~ <dig> and 10- <dig> kda, suggesting that corresponding proteins lacked the ld epitope. this was confirmed by the somewhat "reverse" pattern seen when using the snare-specific antibody alone: in addition to vamp7a, md <dig> recognized the bands of ~ <dig> kda  and 10- <dig> kda , while it did not recognize those putatively corresponding to isoforms vamp7b and vamp7j, both of which are missing the snare epitope. absence of a band for vamp7i is not surprising, given that this isoform shows low expression in jurkat cells and it would be recognized only by the weakest antibody . quantitative pcr data showed that in human tissues the expression of minor isoforms is relatively high. however, the md antibodies could not be used with tissue extracts from other mammals, because as at the sybl <dig> locus shows organism-specific regulation, as e.g splice variants in human and mouse are different in both number and structure . therefore, further investigations will be needed to confirm the presence of all isoforms at protein level.

vamp7/ti-vamp isoforms show different subcellular localizations
the only vamp <dig> splice variant characterized so far is vamp7c: its truncated n-terminal region is unable to bind δ-ap <dig> and this results in a subcellular localization that differs from that of the main isoform  <cit> . since the newly identified isoforms  also show variant domain architectures, we compared their subcellular localization to the main isoform using fluorescent protein tagged chimeras. figure  <dig> shows confocal plane images from living hela cells that were co-transfected with egfp-tagged splice variant and rfp tagged main isoform. large yellow areas of co-localization are apparent in merged images for vamp7d/h. on the other hand, vamp7b shows a somewhat widespread distribution and the subcellular localization of vamp7j is also different from the punctate localization of vamp7a, as red areas are clearly apparent in merged images. however, partial co-localization with vamp7a cannot be excluded. intriguingly, vamp7i is the only isoform that also shows a nuclear localization. however, highly widespread vamp7i and punctate, restricted-area vamp7a indicate a quite different subcellular localization also in the cytoplasm.

CONCLUSIONS
fine tuning of gene functions is an important strategy by which higher organisms can achieve their complexity without needing a proportional increase in gene number. indeed, as at a single locus can result in the production of a  number of splice isoforms with varying domain architecture and function. it is noteworthy that increased complexity in trafficking routes mediated by vamp <dig> is achieved in plants by increased gene number, whereas a corresponding increase in animals is not apparent. rather, as observed for other snares and trafficking proteins, the sybl <dig> locus undergoes as and this in turn results in a number of vamp <dig> isoforms with intriguing modulation in domain architecture. further work will be needed to characterize biochemical, structural and cellular properties of each isoform. however, these "natural mutants" of vamp <dig> can be now used to shed more light on the function of the ld and other regions/domains. to this aim, artificial constructs have been used so far: the subcellular localization of several chimeric vamp <dig> proteins was compared in plants  <cit> , whereas separated vamp <dig> domains were used to investigate both subcellular localization and effects on mammalian cell physiology. in particular, a synaptobrevin-like Δ-longin fragment and an ld-only constructs were found to elicit somewhat opposite effects  <cit> . isoforms vamp7d/h and vamp7i show the same domain architectures of respectively Δ-longin and ld-only fragments and are likely to mediate equal/similar effects. noteworthy, vamp7d/h and Δ-longin fragment co-localize with vamp7a, while vamp7i and ld-only do not, thus showing congruent subcellular sorting in two different cell types . as at the sybl <dig> locus results in a more sophisticated modulation of the domain architecture: two non-snare isoforms consist of the ld alone  or "membrane-anchored" ld , and two Δ-longin isoforms  share synaptobrevin-like architecture with different n-terminal extensions. finally, vamp7b is only partially "non-snare" because it still keeps the n-terminal part of the snare, which is crucial for intramolecular binding to the ld, closed conformation and targeting  <cit> . vamp7b and vamp7a show different subcellular localization, in agreement with evidence that other protein regions/domains can modulate subcellular targeting capacity of the ld  <cit> . this is further suggested when comparing vamp7i and vamp7j, which share the ld and lack the snare motif. vamp7i is found in the nucleus, whereas the transmembrane anchor in vamp7j is likely to prevent nuclear localization. indeed, vamp7i consists only of the ld fold, similar to longin-like proteins  <cit>  like σ ap  <cit>  and sedlin  <cit> . intriguingly, sedlin has been recently reported to show nuclear localization and to interact with transcription factors  and tf-binding proteins  <cit> . production by as of non-snare isoforms further strengthens the concept that the ld can play an important role in trafficking independently on the snare motif, as suggested by the existence of non snare longins  <cit> . tissue-specific expression data suggest that as at the sybl <dig> locus is developmentally regulated along cell lineage/tissue differentiation. alternative mrnas encoding variants with different domain combinations are expressed at levels ranging 5-12% of vamp7a  in cell lines. in differentiated tissues the aggregate level of non-snare, inhibitory variants is comparable or even higher than vamp7a. each isoform might contribute to finely tune vamp7-mediated regulation of cell physiology: indeed, several regulatory mechanisms do not require for 1: <dig> interactions. the main isoform is distributed among multiple locations along its trafficking route, because of interactions mediated by all its domains. instead, splice variants missing either the ld or the snare motif are likely more involved in specific interactions, thus increasing their relative weight in influencing specific trafficking events. evidence from this work further suggests that as may contribute to finely tune the vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking specificity, providing new insights about the biological importance of the longin domain over the snare functions.
