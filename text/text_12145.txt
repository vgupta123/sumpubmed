BACKGROUND
the postpartum bovine uterus undergoes involution - a process involving uterine size reduction, contraction, caruncle shedding, necrosis and rejuvenation of endometrial tissue. involution ensures that the uterus returns to a physiological functioning state, becoming receptive to and supportive of a new conceptus
 <cit> . during involution bovine uteri are invariably exposed to bacterial contamination, clearance and recontamination early postpartum, normally followed by the spontaneous clearance of bacteria 10-15 days postpartum  in healthy cows
 <cit> .

the involvement of inflammatory processes and the immune response during involution in the cow has been the subject of numerous recent studies. at a cellular level, uterine inflammation early postpartum is characterised by a neutrophil-rich endometrial inflammatory cell infiltrate
 <cit>  crucial for acute wound healing
 <cit> . resolution of endometrial inflammation is identifiable in healthy animals by the reduction of the number of neutrophils as involution progresses
 <cit> . the molecular changes that accompany uterine involution postpartum consists of extensive immune gene activation
 <cit> . it is now established that the postpartum endometrial inflammatory response and its allied immune gene activation is a transient feature of the normal physiological events associated with uterine involution
 <cit> .

however, a large proportion of cows fail to spontaneously clear bacterial infections postpartum 
 <cit>  and dysregulation of the immune response in these animals may lead to prolonged inflammation and development of disease
 <cit> . previously by histopathological assessments of uterine biopsies, we have described endometrial infiltration by leukocytes early during involution which was significantly reduced by  <dig> dpp. in parallel, we showed significant temporal reduction in toll-like receptor, leukocyte surface receptor, pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial gene transcription during later stages of involution
 <cit> . in the current study we hypothesised that repeat uterine biopsies, at two postpartum time points in healthy cows undergoing involution, would reveal distinct temporal gene expression profiles identifying molecular changes associated with bacterial clearance and the resolution of inflammation.

recent publications in this area have elucidated the mechanisms of bovine endometrial infection and immune responses in primary cells in vitro <cit> . however, the complexity of the uterine bacterial milieu and immune responses observed in vivo are influenced by a variety of animal factors, such as energy balance
 <cit>  which cannot be accurately replicated in vitro. therefore, postpartum changes over time, in endometrial biopsies ex vivo, are likely to reflect a more accurate profile of the immune response in healthy compared to diseased animals
 <cit> . interestingly, new approaches have used endometrial explants to characterise endometrial immune function ex vivo in response to specific bacterial stimuli
 <cit> . these studies focus on specific gene subsets whereas the current study takes a more comprehensive approach by analysing the entire transcriptome of endometrial biopsies providing a novel and important insight into the regulation of inflammation postpartum.

this is the first study to use next generation sequencing to assess bovine endometrial inflammation postpartum and the temporal resolution of this inflammation during involution in healthy cows. next-generation sequencing is not limited by the pre-selection of specific candidate genes for absolute gene expression analysis and the digital readout of gene sequence is superior to the relative fluorescence methods used in qrt-pcr and microarray analyses
 <cit> . a genome-wide transcriptomic profile of endometrial biopsies  <dig> and  <dig> dpp was generated with mrna-seq and subsequently goseq kegg pathway analysis identified enriched gene networks. this data, plus validation of specific gene expression patterns in additional postpartum animals provides evidence for a transcriptomic switch from a pro-inflammatory gene expression phenotype  <dig> dpp to a tissue regenerative and proliferative phenotype  <dig> dpp. this dataset highlights the value of large scale genomic approaches toward understanding the immune regulatory networks associated with normal bacterial clearance and the resolution of inflammation in the postpartum cow that may form the basis for future diagnosis of delayed clearance and perturbed immune regulation in diseased animals.

RESULTS
mrna-seq read alignment and differential gene expression
mrna-seq read alignment, summarization and library normalization is tabulated in additional files
 <dig> . the average number of raw reads across all samples was  <dig>  million and the average number of reads across all samples with one reported alignment was  <dig>  million. this data has been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> 

two output files were constructed from the edger results, based on different levels of stringency. using a p-value cut off of  <dig> ,  <dig>  significantly differentially expressed genes were identified, of which  <dig> were elevated  <dig> dpp and  <dig>  elevated  <dig> dpp. with an adjusted p-value of  <dig> , the second output file contained  <dig>  genes of which  <dig> were significantly increased  <dig> dpp and  <dig>  significantly increased  <dig> dpp .

to assess the contribution of changes in endometrial cell subpopulations to the differential gene expression patterns detected between the two post partum time points, the expression of cell surface markers associated with specific leukocyte cell subsets were analysed at a molecular level. the mrna-seq data showed that six genes encoding leukocyte cell surface markers cd11d , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd62l  were significantly elevated at  <dig> dpp with a p-value of <  <dig>  but are not significant using an adjusted p-value of <  <dig> .

goseq kegg pathway analysis
goseq is designed to account for gene length bias and was therefore selected to identify enriched pathways in the dataset. to account for the under representation of bovine genes in goseq kegg pathway analysis genes with a p <  <dig>  were initially used. additional analysis was also performed using the more stringent gene set  which reduces the risk of false positive genes in goseq kegg pathway analysis. five pathways were enriched  <dig> dpp by genes with an adjusted p of <  <dig> , all of which are also present in the list of enriched pathways containing genes with a p <  <dig> . nineteen pathways were enriched  <dig> dpp containing genes with an adjusted p <  <dig>  and eighteen of these pathways are also present in the list of enriched pathways containing genes with a p <  <dig> . the majority of the top enriched pathways   <dig> dpp from both gene datasets are immune associated such as t cell receptor signalling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, natural killer cell mediated cytoxicity, ppar signalling pathway, rheumatoid arthritis, graft-versus-host disease, allograft rejection and autoimmune thyroid disease . a different functional profile is observed  <dig> dpp depicted by the top enriched pathways  at this time , which are indicative of proliferation and repair such as pathways in cancer, focal adhesion, wingless type  signalling pathway  and extracellular matrix -receptor interaction .

quantitative expression of candidate genes in additional animals
an extended panel of animals  from the original sample set were used for qrt-pcr assessment of  <dig> candidate genes selected based on a variety of criteria . thirteen of these genes were annotated in the kegg pathways: igf <dig> , mgat <dig> , pdgfra , rasgrp <dig> , rdh <dig> , wnt5a , shc <dig>  bmp <dig>  ctf <dig>  cldn <dig> , cdh <dig> , tnfrsf <dig>  and cd <dig> . the three candidate genes with no pathway annotation in the kegg database were: plac <dig> , gata <dig>  and rarres <dig> . eleven of these candidate genes  were represented in the enriched pathways , with the exception of mgat <dig> and rdh <dig> 

the qrt-pcr gene expression profile across this gene set corroborated the profile detected using mrna-seq, with  <dig> of the  <dig> genes increased in expression  <dig> dpp and  <dig> genes increased in expression  <dig> dpp for both expression analysis platforms. however the magnitude of the log <dig> fold change was lower for qrt-pcr compared to mrna-seq for the majority of candidate genes which is probably due to the larger sample size used for qrt-pcr introducing greater biological variation .

of the  <dig> candidate genes assessed by qrt-pcr,  <dig> were significantly increased  <dig> dpp in all  <dig> additional postpartum animals: serum amyloid a -  <dig>  , insulin growth factor  <dig>  , gata binding protein  <dig>  , serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade a , member  <dig>   and src homology  <dig> domain containing transforming protein c <dig>   . other genes were also differentially expressed however these did not achieve statistical significance - wnt5a , pdgfra  and mgat <dig> .

of note, six of the nineteen candidate genes selected from ngs data analysis have  <dig> reads aligned at one of the time points across all samples. five genes, shc <dig>  serpina <dig>  bmp <dig>  ctf <dig> and saa1/ <dig>  have no aligned reads  <dig> dpp and have an average of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads respectively, aligned  <dig> dpp across all animals. one gene  has no reads aligned  <dig> dpp and an average of  <dig> reads aligned  <dig> dpp. it is not possible to calculate the fold change in these instances, therefore for illustrative purposes twice the highest log <dig> fold change was set as the fold change .

discussion
uterine disease and disrupted fertility is the single biggest factor limiting the international dairy industry, with costs estimated at € <dig>  billion within the european union alone
 <cit> . understanding the role of the immune response in driving bacterial clearance postpartum, but also in restoring homeostasis, is likely to lead to new methods for enhancing fertility.

at both a cellular and a molecular level, there is increasing evidence for an intimate role of the immune response during involution. neutrophil influx into the endometrium is a common mechanism associated with beneficial bacterial clearance, although evidence suggests that their phagocytic activity may be reduced in disease susceptible animals
 <cit> . recent research has shown the activation of many immune activation pathways 
 <cit> , inflammatory genes
 <cit> , antimicrobial peptides and acute phase proteins
 <cit>  during the early postpartum period. expression of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, tlr <dig> for example, has been shown to be temporally elevated in the postpartum uterus during involution
 <cit> , between high and low fertility cows
 <cit>  and in endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in response to lps in vitro <cit> .

however, unregulated inflammation can lead to disease
 <cit> , therefore a balanced inflammatory immune response is key to sufficient bacterial clearance and the restoration of an endometrial environment capable of supporting a new pregnancy
 <cit> . this resolution of inflammation and the pathways involved in restoration of uterine homeostasis have not been extensively explored in healthy cows. significantly elevated endometrial inflammatory gene expression  has been previously documented in cows with endometritis at various time points postpartum
 <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that dysregulation of the immune response  is a contributory factor to disease development.

endometrial inflammation was graded based on the number of leukocytes present in the biopsy and candidate gene expression analysis showed significant temporal differences in this limited gene dataset  between the two time points across involution, as previously described
 <cit> . the different ontological classes of differentially expressed genes  led us to hypothesise that temporal genome wide differential gene expression profiles would shed light on the pathways involved in both the activation of an inflammatory immune response early postpartum but importantly, also on the pathways involved in the regulation of inflammation and the restoration of homeostasis in these healthy cows. in the current study using the same animals, we use next generation sequencing to define the genome wide temporal changes in gene expression at two time points during involution in the postpartum cow.

approximately only 27% of bovine genes are currently represented in the kegg database, and therefore using a p-value cut-off of <  <dig> ,  <dig>  genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed between endometrial biopsies from the same animals across time points,  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp. using increased stringency of an adjusted p <  <dig> , over  <dig>  genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed. in both sets of results, the immune system was predominantly represented by enriched pathways at  <dig> dpp. these pathways included t cell receptor signalling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, graft-versus-host disease and allograft rejection. this result concurs with related studies which have examined the expression of a limited number of candidate immune genes to show the activation of an inflammatory immune response in the postpartum endometrium
 <cit> .

however, the majority of the differentially expressed genes detected in this study were significantly increased at the  <dig> dpp time point. the resolution of inflammation, as defined by histopathological assessment in these cows
 <cit> , was supported by the significant decrease in expression of immune pathways as involution proceeds. at this time point  enriched pathways, such as focal adhesion, wnt signalling and ecm-receptor interaction, were associated with tissue regeneration and proliferative activity, reflecting repair processes. this complete temporal change in the endometrial transcriptomic profile from a pro-inflammatory immune response phenotype to a tissue regenerative profile shows rapid but transient immune induction in the uterus to clear bacteria and reduce associated inflammation within a 2 week period in healthy cows. it is likely that changes in both resident and migratory cell populations between time points in response to bacterial infection and during involution account for some of the endometrial transcriptome differences detected. however, expression of a number of leukocyte associated markers  were not significantly different using our stringent selection criteria. interestingly, cd62l - a cell surface adhesion molecule found on the surface of neutrophils was significantly elevated in expression  <dig> dpp , which correlates with the increased neutrophils detected in these animals using histology. however cd62l was not significantly differentially expressed using an adjusted p-value of <  <dig> .

endometrial receptivity has previously been associated with an increase in extracellular matrix  remodelling pathways
 <cit> , which is also one of the top enriched pathways  <dig> dpp in this study. a cancer associated pathway is another of the top enriched pathways  <dig> dpp which highlights the proliferative capacity of the endometrium in the current study. gene-expression patterns linked with the regeneration of damaged tissue closely resemble that of highly malignant tumors, as there is significant enrichment of genes involved in cell proliferation in both instances
 <cit> . in addition to cell proliferative processes, the endometrium is also undergoing regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and tissue homeostasis and repair  <dig> dpp, evident by the enrichment of the wnt signalling pathway
 <cit> .

five candidate genes involved in this temporal transcriptomic change , were found to be significantly differentially expressed  <dig> dpp. the elevation of saa1/ <dig> expression  <dig> dpp, suggests it has a role in postpartum inflammatory resolution in the endometrium of healthy cows. serum amyloid a  is an acute phase protein  produced and released by hepatocytes but it is also expressed in extrahepatic bovine tissues
 <cit> , constitutively in healthy endometria
 <cit>  and during inflammation
 <cit> . studies have shown that saa functions to preserve tissue maintenance and homeostasis
 <cit>  and saa1/ <dig> in particular has been shown in murine studies to be involved in the provision of immune homeostasis in mucosal tissue
 <cit> . the elevated expression of saa1/ <dig>  <dig> dpp may be indicative of the re-establishment of immune homeostasis later in involution as inflammation resolves.

results also show the significant increased expression of gata <dig> as involution progresses in the postpartum uterus. gene expression of interferon-tau , a luteotrophic molecule, is regulated by the expression of gata <dig> in the bovine trophoblast
 <cit> , and is also expressed in endometrial epithelial cells during the peri-attachment period of the conceptus in sheep
 <cit> . gata <dig> has also been recently shown to regulate the gene expression of endomucin, which is critical for cell growth, migration and angiogenesis, to ensure endothelial cell maintenance and physiological function
 <cit> .

at systemic and local levels the insulin growth factor  system is implicated in endometrial repair and healing during involution
 <cit> . decreased expression of igf <dig> has been observed in the previously gravid compared to the non-gravid uterine horn of the same cow  <dig> dpp
 <cit> . in the present study we compared the progression of involution in the previously gravid uterine horn to a later stage of involution in the same horn and demonstrated that the expression of igf <dig> was elevated  <dig> dpp. in a murine study it has been shown that bioavailable igf <dig> stimulates uteral growth therefore functioning to increase uterine size
 <cit> . a recent bovine study has suggested that an increase of igf <dig> bioavailability has a negative effect on oocyte developmental competence
 <cit> . an increase in igf <dig> gene expression  <dig> dpp in the present study may infer proliferative effects on the uterus.

shc <dig> gene expression was increased  <dig> dpp and is one of many genes enriching the focal adhesion pathway at this time, suggesting a role for shc <dig> in biological processes such as cell differentiation, motility, regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, and cell survival in the endometrium later in involution. the src family kinases are non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the mediation of intracellular signal transduction to initiate biological processes such as adhesion, migration, invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, apoptosis resistance and proliferation. src members are activated by the binding of ligands to either their src homology  <dig>  or  <dig>  domains
 <cit> . in bovine endometrial epithelial cells it has been hypothesised that epidermal growth factor receptor may aid in the amplification of oxytocin signalling and activate c-src resulting in the elevation of prostaglandin f2α production, which is a luteolytic event
 <cit> .

serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade a , member  <dig>  belongs to the serpin superfamily of serine peptidase inhibitors 
 <cit>  and has also been previously called uterine milk protein . serine proteases are associated with immune functions involving inflammation, tissue remodelling, pathogen clearance and apoptosis, the over production of which causes pathologies in auto-immune diseases, tumor metastasis and allergies
 <cit> . serpins limit the activity of serine proteases thereby regulating the severity of their immune functions
 <cit> . gene expression of utmp has been observed predominantly in the bovine endometrium, ovary and caruncle tissues and the differential allelic expression of which has been associated with longevity in dairy cattle
 <cit> . expression of serpina <dig> has been previously shown to be elevated by estrogens during estrus in cattle
 <cit>  and also during pregnancy
 <cit> . during pregnancy utmp is thought to have a role in maternal immune modulation, by inhibiting nk-like activity and thus protecting the conceptus in utero <cit> . importantly, another study in sheep suggests that the expression of utmp in the endometrium is a marker of differentiated and functional glandular epithelium
 <cit> . in the present study an increase of serpina <dig> expression  <dig> dpp possibly indicates a greater degree of glandular epithelium repair within the endometrium at this time.

based on the considerable research performed on these genes in other species, our results point toward an important functional role for saa1/ <dig>  gata <dig>  igf <dig>  shc <dig>  and serpina <dig> genes, in the restoration of homeostasis during bovine involution.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the entire transcriptome provides a molecular gateway through which the physiological process of involution can be understood in greater detail. it is evident that a pro-inflammatory immune response is instigated early postpartum by the influx of leukocytes into the endometrium, at a cellular level, and by the significant expression of immune genes and pathways  <dig> dpp, at a molecular level. the transcriptomic response  <dig> dpp is quite distinct as the majority of differentially expressed genes are increased at this time point, and they represent an enrichment of cellular pathways associated with tissue proliferation and repair.

therefore, immune activation and inflammation is a transient feature in the healthy postpartum endometrium with a temporal switch toward tissue repair and proliferation pathways that restore homeostasis and prepare the uterus for a subsequent pregnancy. individual candidate genes involved in this temporal transcriptomic change have been identified as markers of endometrial inflammatory resolution  in cattle. results from this study will form an independent baseline for future studies in animals that develop disease.
