BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis  is a narrow host range salmonella serovar that predominately colonizes swine, although this serovar can also cause serious infections in human patients  <cit> . with clinical manifestations of enterocolitis, pneumonia, septicemia and hepatitis, s. choleraesuis infections result in a higher mortality rate in pigs than s. typhimurium, a broad host range salmonella serovar that typically causes only enterocolitis in swine. this highly invasive serovar is of particular concern to the swine industry since pig salmonellosis results in about $ <dig> million in annual production losses in the united states  <cit> . s. choleraesuis can result in higher mortality than s. typhimurium infection in pigs. moreover, s. choleraesuis infected pigs can develop a carrier state lasting as long as  <dig> weeks  <cit> ; resulting in shedding of the bacteria by carrier pigs and salmonella contamination of the environment. researchers have speculated that human systemic infections caused by s. choleraesuis are acquired from pigs, as affirmed by dna fingerprints of the s. choleraesuis isolated from humans and swine  <cit> . although an oral s. choleraesuis vaccine  has been shown to enhance humoral and cellular immune responses  <cit> , s. choleraesuis infections can be particularly difficult to treat due to its resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. thus s. choleraesuis is both a swine industry and public health problem.

while several serovars such as s. typhimurium have been extensively studied, a relatively limited number of experiments on the s. choleraesuis serovar have been published using a swine infection model  <cit> . the transcriptional response to salmonella infection is predominantly a th <dig> immune response as observed in porcine lung during s. choleraesuis infection  <cit>  and in porcine mesenteric lymph nodes  during s. typhimurium and s. choleraesuis infection  <cit> . the antigen processing- and apoptosis-related pathways were strongly induced at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi in porcine lung during s. choleraesuis infection based on oligonucleotide microarray data  <cit> . two important early proinflammatory cytokines, il <dig> and il1b, were rapidly induced in porcine jejunal and distal ileal peyer's patches during s. choleraesuis infection  <cit> . uthe et al.  used suppression subtractive hybridization  to identify genes which were up- or down-regulated at  <dig> hpi in porcine mln during s. choleraesuis infection compared to non-infected animals. most of these genes have been annotated as being involved in host cellular functions including innate immunity and cytoskeleton regulation  <cit> . skjolaas et al.  tested the effect of s. choleraesuis infection on gene expression in pig jejunal epithelial cells; il <dig> and ccl <dig> were significantly induced at  <dig>  h and  <dig> h post exposure, whereas ccl <dig> reached peak response at  <dig> h post exposure  <cit> . recently, two publications described the use of an ileal loop model to explore the transcriptional response of pig intestinal mucosa to s. typhimurium  <cit>  and to both s. typhimurium and s. choleraesuis  <cit> . the former study showed very few gene expression differences in ileal tissue over 1– <dig> hpi, and il <dig> was found to be induced only at  <dig> hpi  <cit> . however, the latter study showed that tnfα, il <dig> and il- <dig> was induced significantly during s. typhimurium infection compared to serovar choleraesuis at  <dig> hpi  <cit> .

a comparison of the molecular pathways controlling host-pathogen interactions will not only increase our understanding of immune response biology, but may provide targets for drug development and genetic improvement of disease resistance. in this study, a genome-wide investigation of the porcine response to s. choleraesuis infection was conducted using the affymetrix genechip® porcine genome array containing oligonucleotides representing approximately  <dig>  transcripts from  <dig>  s. scrofa genes. we report the global transcriptional profile of the mln, the largest lymph nodes in the human and animal body and one of the components of gut-associated lymphoid tissues , to s. choleraesuis infection at the acute and chronic stages. we characterized the host immune responses with pathway analysis, targeting a better understanding of the host's innate immune pathways and regulatory targets in the mln. we also confirmed the induction of many members of the nfκb pathway during the infection and detected previously unidentified potential nfκb target genes. we extended this broad screen for transcriptionally responsive genes by defining a set of gene as novel nfκb targets genes as they are co-expressed with known nfκb targets and whose orthologous human promoters contain nfκb binding motifs.

RESULTS
clinical signs of disease
clinical disease post-inoculation with s. choleraesuis was observed in the animals in this study, and described previously  <cit> . briefly, loss of appetite, lethargy and diarrhea of infected animals were observed at  <dig> hpi and continued until  <dig> dpi. the rectal temperature of infected animals peaked at  <dig> hpi  and gradually declined to that seen in non-infected animals  by  <dig> dpi. serovar choleraesuis was detected in the ileocecal lymph nodes at  <dig> hpi , reached and maintained a level of 2– <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/g from  <dig> h to  <dig> dpi., and declined to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/g by  <dig> dpi.

transcriptome
the normal porcine mln tissue transcriptome was represented by all probesets  which showed a present call by the affymetrix microarray analysis system  <dig>  for all three non-infected animals. all probesets that showed a present call for all three replicates in at least one time point during infection  were counted as the transcriptome of infected porcine mln tissue. combining these lists gave  <dig>  probesets  that detected expression in mln .

differentially expressed gene analysis during s. choleraesuis infection
swine infected with s. choleraesuis exhibit high bacterial loads as early as  <dig> hours post infection and reach maximal levels at 2– <dig> dpi  <cit> . thus we have targeted our screen for responsive genes at the early time points of infection where unique control mechanisms might be revealed. genes with a p-value <  <dig>  and an estimated fc >  <dig> in at least one of the  <dig> time point pair-wise comparisons were declared to be differentially expressed. a total of  <dig>  genes satisfied these criteria . the largest q-value associated with this list of genes was  <dig> , which is an estimated upper bound of the false discovery rate . of these  <dig>  differentially expressed genes,  <dig>  genes  have sequence similarity to a human refseq based on our blast analysis using consensus sequences based on alignments of all publicly available porcine expressed sequence data .

also, compared to non-infected pigs, the transcriptional response to s. choleraesuis infection identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed  at  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi and  <dig> dpi, respectively . clearly, a strong transcriptional response was observed at  <dig> hpi, with a similar number of up- and down-regulated genes. table  <dig> shows  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes with a fold change greater than  <dig> at  <dig> hpi in infected mlns, relative to non-infected mlns . of the  <dig> annotated up-regulated genes in table  <dig>   <dig> genes  are involved in immune response, inflammation and apoptosis. the other  <dig> up-regulated genes, steap <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  pstpip <dig>  lipg, hk <dig>  stxbp <dig> and itpr <dig>  have not been previously associated with bacterial infection. the s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig>  exhibited the highest fold change  at  <dig> hpi, compared to non-infected pigs. a gene from the same family, s100a <dig>  also showed strong up-regulation . compared to the  <dig> up-regulated genes, only  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated using the same criteria of p-value <  <dig>  and estimated fc >  <dig>  of these, only  <dig> genes  have been annotated, and none of these previously have been shown to be involved in the response to bacterial infection.

cluster analysis
to get a broad overview of the changes in gene expression during infection and identify co-expressed gene clusters, a heat map was created using gene cluster  <dig>  software for the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. two distinct clusters, an induced gene cluster and a repressed gene cluster, were identified and several interesting gene expression patterns were exhibited . group a includes  <dig> genes that were repressed at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, after which rna levels returned to those seen in the non-infected animals. many ribosomal protein genes, as well as eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha  <dig> were included in this group. a large number of genes that presented a comparatively lower expression level at  <dig> hpi during infection were found in group b. the annotated genes in this group had diverse biological functions, without an obvious overrepresentation of any specific pathway. a common feature of genes in group c, d and e is that they had a peak rna response at  <dig> hpi during infection. however, genes in each group had different peak response times:  <dig> genes in group c, such as infg, psmb <dig>  psmb <dig> and c <dig>  were only up-regulated at  <dig> hpi, while  <dig> genes in group d, such as tnf, il <dig>  il <dig>  il1a and il1b, increased their expression level at  <dig> hpi and expression peaked at  <dig> hpi. genes in group e were slightly up-regulated as early as  <dig> hpi during infection; some heat shock proteins, such as hspb <dig>  hspa <dig>  hspa1b were found in this group. an additional group f contained genes that were up-regulated at both the acute and chronic stages of infection, as compared to non-infected animals. this group included  <dig> annotated genes, including two complement related genes, c1qa and cfh.

gene ontology annotation
additional go annotation of the  <dig>  transcripts expressed in mln were performed using our laboratory-designed go-slim  <cit> , built with terms in the biological process and molecular function categories of the go database relevant for immune biology . about  <dig>  transcripts were assigned specific go terms. approximately 39% of these transcripts were annotated as being involved in cellular metabolic processes, and a significant number of transcripts were assigned known functions in signal transduction , cell differentiation , cell cycle , calcium ion binding , apoptosis , cell adhesion  and cell proliferation . an additional 13% of the transcripts were assigned go terms related to protein folding, immune response, cell migration, inflammatory response, defense response, antigen processing, and antigen presentation. the immune-oriented go-slim annotation of the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes was also performed  and compared to the global transcriptome go term assignment. the proportion of genes assigned go terms associated with cell adhesion, apoptosis, immune response, inflammatory response, cellular metabolic process, calcium ion binding activity and acute-phase response was significantly enriched in our differentially expressed gene list , compared to the transcriptome go assignment.

an over-representation of a specific biological process does not indicate whether the process in question is being stimulated or repressed overall. to investigate over- or under-represented functional activities specifically within the up-regulated and down-regulated genes, go annotations were also assigned to transcripts from the induced and repressed clusters again using the go-slim  <cit>  as above. statistical analysis revealed that genes annotated with go terms of immune response, innate immune response, defense response, apoptosis and cellular metabolic process were significantly enriched in the induced cluster, while the repressed cluster had a significantly higher percentage of genes related to cell adhesion  .

pathway analysis
during bacterial infection, t cells will migrate into the t-cell zone of the mln and scan the surface of the antigen-presenting cells, primarily macrophages and dendritic cells, for specific peptide:mhc complexes  <cit> . the levels of any rna transcript present in the mln can be changed by cells migrating into or out of the lymph node, and these rna changes might be erroneously interpreted as transcriptional response to infection within an immune cell type. to verify that the observed differences in gene expression are true transcriptional differences, affymetrix data-based expression levels of specific markers for t cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes were checked. no evidence of major changes in cell migration was observed since most rna levels for these marker genes did not change significantly . as we have further concentrated our analyses and interpretations on genes with large differences in expression, these data indicate the rna differences we observed are likely representative of specific transcriptional responses within cells, and not due to significant changes in the abundance of specific cell types in the mln.

to investigate immune-related pathways stimulated during infection, the affymetrix-based expression patterns of genes that are known to be involved in specific immune pathways were collected . results showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> selected th1-related genes, such as infg, irf <dig>  socs <dig>  stat <dig>  tnf and wars, were significantly up-regulated at  <dig> hpi, while genes known to be predominately associated with th <dig> response , were down-regulated or unchanged respectively at all time points during infection . these data suggest that s. choleraesuis elicited primarily a th1-associated response within the mln during infection.

most genes known to be involved in innate/inflammatory pathways in fig 4b, such as il- <dig>  il <dig>  slc11a <dig>  tlr <dig> and il1b, increased their rna expression level significantly at  <dig> hpi and/or  <dig> hpi during infection. strong induction of apoptosis pathways was also observed in response to s. choleraesuis infection. seven apoptosis related genes  were up-regulated significantly at  <dig> hpi and/or  <dig> hpi.

two antigen-processing related genes, psmb <dig> and tap <dig>  were induced at  <dig> hpi, which indicates that the antigen processing pathway was activated. however, s. choleraesuis infection did not appear to significantly influence the antigen presentation/dc function pathway, because two genes known to be involved in dendritic cell activation, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  did not show elevated expression level at either  <dig> or  <dig> hpi. in addition, cd <dig>  which is also named dc-sign, showed non-significant changes during infection .

we observed a significant induction of genes at  <dig> hpi that have go annotation of calcium binding activity, including s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  several anxa family genes, and calu. therefore, we speculate that calcium pathways were strongly affected by infection at this time . further, annotation showed that many of the genes that were up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi are known direct nfκb targets . these  <dig> known nfκb genes are listed in additional file  <dig>  to determine whether nfκb dependent genes formed a central part of the host transcriptional response to s. choleraesuis infection, go analysis was performed to compare the functional activities of these differentially expressed known nfκb target genes from an "early" group, defined as genes that were up-regulated significantly at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi , and a "late" group, defined as genes that were only up-regulated at  <dig> hpi . figure  <dig> demonstrates that cytokine or chemokine activity go terms found in the known nfκb target genes , were enriched in the early group as compared to the late group . the late group nfκb target genes were predominantly annotated in the signal transduction and cell metabolism categories.

q-pcr analysis of differentially expressed porcine genes
to confirm the nfκb genes that were declared differentially expressed in our microarray analysis, a panel of  <dig> genes was selected for real-time pcr analysis and validation of the expression patterns at  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. the rna levels of  <dig> known nfκb target genes  were measured. we also analyzed the expression for a t cell marker gene  and a macrophage marker gene cd <dig>  although an oligonucleotide set representing the tgm <dig> gene could not be found on the affymetrix microarray, q-pcr was performed for this gene since our earlier work  <cit>  showed a strong up-regulation of tgm <dig> in porcine lung during acute infection with s. choleraesuis, and the temporal expression pattern is similar to known nfκb target genes. finally, trem <dig> was also selected for q-pcr validation because our microarray data showed its expression pattern to be similar to known nfκb target genes, although no reports have shown that trem <dig> is directly regulated by nfκb. comparison of the qpcr results with the microarray data demonstrated that expression differences for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were statistically significant by qpcr, confirming the affymetrix-based results for these genes and rna samples . results showed that, except for cd <dig>  all known nfκb-regulated genes were significantly up-regulated at  <dig> hpi during infection, and many of the genes experienced a strong induction from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi. we also confirmed that tgm <dig>  trem <dig> and cd <dig> exhibited a similar transcriptional profile with many known nfκb target genes.

expression values not sharing the same letters are statistically different across time points.

identification of putative nfκb target genes within the differentially expressed gene lists through bioinformatic analysis of the human orthologous promoter sequences
to further explore the possibility that the response observed might have identified novel nf-κb target genes, we collected in silico comparative evidence that nfκb may bind to flanking sequences of these genes . we used human genomic sequence data for the differentially expressed genes in the early group , the late group , and all up-regulated genes to identify those genes containing statistically significant nfκb binding sequence motifs near their promoters. the latter group contained  <dig> genes total, with  <dig> orthologs found, of which we used only  <dig> human orthologs  in the tfm-explorer analyses  <cit> , as this was the maximum allowed by tfm-explorer. however, all  <dig> were used in clover  <cit>  as a single group; a <dig>  we also investigated the effect on finding putative nfκb targets in these groups when removing the known nfκb target genes from these groups , to explore the underlying regulatory "signal" in these promoters. thus we generated an early group without  <dig> known targets , a late group with  <dig> known nfκb targets removed , and a complete group of all up-regulated differentially expressed genes with the  <dig> known nfκb targets removed .

tfm-explorer analysis of e <dig>  representing all genes up-regulated in the first 8– <dig> hpi but with known nfκb targets removed, found  <dig> promoters  with at least one nfκb binding site . however, when the full e <dig> set, including all known nfκb targets, was analyzed,  <dig> sequences  were identified with one or more nfκb binding sites . the software identified almost all of the known targets . similarly, tfm-explorer analysis of l <dig>  identified  <dig> sequences with target sites, while analysis of l <dig> identified  <dig> sequences with nfκb sites, including  <dig> out of  <dig> known nfκb targets. similar analysis of u <dig> identified  <dig> gene promoters with nfκb motifs, while an average of the results for testing five a <dig> groups  shows  <dig> sequences were identified , which on average found  <dig> of the  <dig> known nfκb target genes in this group  .

clover analysis shows similar results using  <dig>  permutations and p <  <dig>  as a significance level cut-off. in the e <dig> group  <dig> of the  <dig> input sequences were found to have a nfκb binding sequence, with  <dig> of the  <dig> known targets being found. for l <dig>  clover identified  <dig> putative targets including  <dig> out of the  <dig> known targets. when all differentially expressed genes are grouped together, ,  <dig> promoter regions were identified to contain a putative binding site; finding  <dig> out of  <dig> known targets. taking the intersection of tfm-explorer and clover results, there are  <dig> promoter sequences with a potential nfκb binding site in the early group. within these  <dig> promoters,  <dig> are known to contain a binding site, leaving  <dig> potential novel nfκb targets. similarly, for the late group  <dig> promoters were found by both programs, and as  <dig> of the promoters are known nfκb targets, this identifies  <dig> potential new direct targets of nfκb. combining the results for only the early and late groups,  <dig> total promoters were predicted to have nfκb binding sites. across the complete set of differentially expressed genes,  <dig> promoter sequences were found by both programs, with  <dig> being previously known targets of nfκb, yielding  <dig> potential new nfκb targets . all genes in the early, late and all categories, as well as whether or not a motif was found for each gene, are shown in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
transcriptome, differentially expressed genes and go annotation
in this study, the affymetrix genechip® porcine genome array and q-pcr were used to monitor the whole-genome expression profile of porcine mln in response to s. choleraesuis infection. quite similar to the porcine mln transcriptome seen in a study on the response to s. typhimurium  <cit> , expression of more than  <dig>  transcripts were reproducibly detected and of these,  <dig>   transcripts had a significant hit to human refseq. thus, we believe the transcriptional response detected in our study represents a high proportion of the porcine genomic response to s. choleraesuis infection within the mln. a technical limitation of this work is that the affymetrix chip cannot assay for transcript that are not represented by probesets. an analytical limitation is that we primarily analyzed only those genes with a relatively large fold change, due to the large number of genes showing differential expression. while a significant number of genes passed our filters, there are additional genes and possibly pathways yet to be analyzed in these data, and all data is provided in additional files and to ncbi-geo. statistical analysis of differential expression revealed  <dig>  genes changed their expression level within at least one of  <dig> possible pair wise comparisons during infection, and about 63% of these differentially expressed genes were annotated using blast analysis. limitation of availability of full-length porcine cdna and the fact that many human/mouse genes do not have functional annotation, the non-annotated genes are currently not very helpful in furthering our understanding of gene functions and pathways responding to infection. however, the discovery of these non-annotated genes as part of the transcriptional response to bacterial infection is novel, and, as better annotation becomes available, will contribute to an improved understanding of the pathways of host response to bacteria infection across host species.

compared to the response in porcine mln during the s. typhimurium infection, where only  <dig> genes were induced significantly at  <dig> hpi  <cit> , a strong host transcriptional response at  <dig> hpi with s. choleraesuis was observed, as  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at  <dig> hpi compared to non-infected pigs . this is consistent with the clinical manifestations that the rectal temperature of infected animals peaked at  <dig> hpi. as expected, we found many genes with large gene expression changes, such as cytokines, chemokines and heat shock proteins; these generally overlap with sets of genes that have been implicated in host response to infection by others  <cit> , indicating our data can be integrated with similar results in other species. however, we also identified a number of genes that had not previously been shown to be involved in host response to bacterial infection, such as steap <dig>  pstpip <dig>  lipg, hk <dig>  stxbp <dig>  itpr <dig>  ca <dig>  krt <dig> and pln. none of these genes responded significantly to s. typhimurium during infection  <cit> . thus we predict that these induced genes are specific to the response to the s. choleraesuis serovar, as compared to s. typhimurium. even though the biological function of these genes during infection remains unclear, these data more fully describe the transcriptional response to s. choleraesuis and suggest additional functional roles for these genes. furthermore, the differentially expressed genes with known immune functions and those with unknown functions add to the list of candidate genes to investigate for associations between immune related traits and dna-level variation; polymorphisms at these candidate genes might result in valuable markers for enhancing disease resistance, pig health, and food safety through molecular breeding methods. even though we are focusing on the early response  during the infection, the genes expressed differentially at day  <dig>  include ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  tgfb <dig> and aif <dig>  and provide additional gene profiling data during the chronic infection stage.

cluster analysis
co-expression of genes of known function with poorly characterized or novel genes may provide a simple means to gain leads as to the functions of genes for which information is not currently available. in our study, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed during infection, and we find the heat map was driven by the  <dig> differentially expressed genes at  <dig> hpi. a similar heat map analysis of the transcriptional response to s. typhimurium shows that the major peak of  <dig> responding genes occurred at  <dig> hpi during infection  <cit> , thus we propose that porcine mln had a different response peak time for s. typhimurium and s. choleraesuis infection. this is consistent with the results from a previous study using ssh technology to investigate expression at  <dig> hpi  <cit> . as we observed in porcine mln response to s. typhimurium  <cit> , some ribosome- and/or translation-related genes were repressed at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. this effect is also similar to the response to lps in skeletal muscle of neonatal and adult pigs  <cit>  and to the response to endotoxin in human blood leukocytes  <cit> , where a large number of genes involved in translation were repressed. thus, we speculate that an early pathogenic effect of multiple serovars of salmonella on the host is suppression of translation.

three gene groups  in the induced cluster exhibited different expression patterns but shared a common feature, a peak expression response at  <dig> hpi. as large numbers of nfκb target genes were found in groups c and d, we discuss their expression features in the context of nfκb signaling pathways below.

pathway analysis
a predominant th <dig> immune response was observed during infection, as  <dig> of  <dig> investigated th <dig> associated genes, including tnf, ifng, and some ifng-signaling responsive genes , were strongly up-regulated at  <dig> hpi and/or  <dig> hpi . this is consistent with the results in porcine lung during s. choleraesuis infection  <cit>  and in porcine mln in both s. typhimurium and s. choleraesuis infection  <cit> . however, il12a and il12b, which are thought to also favor th <dig> cell development, did not change their expression level during infection. their low expression level in response to s. choleraesuis has also been detected by qpcr analysis of infected porcine mln by our group  <cit> . a low expression level of il <dig> has been also observed in the pig in response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  <cit>  and in pig mln response to s. typhimurium infection  <cit>  and toxoplasma gondii  <cit>  infection. we speculate that lack of il <dig> induction during s. choleraesuis infection might stifle ifng induction and negatively affect host defense against salmonella.

our microarray data shows that apoptosis pathway related genes displayed a strong induction at  <dig> hpi and reached a peak response at  <dig> hpi in response to s. choleraesuis infection. multiple genes within gene families involved in apoptosis pathways were induced significantly, such as genes in the caspase family  and in the transglutaminase family . the caspases are a family of cysteine proteases important not only in starting and executing apoptosis, but also in processing and maturation of the inflammatory cytokines il-1b and il- <dig>  <cit> . the casp <dig> gene is known to be important in inflammation due to its role in maturation of il-1b and il- <dig>  even though it is unclear whether casp <dig> plays a direct role in apoptosis, overexpression of casp <dig> has been shown to cause apoptosis in a variety of cell lines  <cit> . a recent study revealed that ipaf is an activator of casp <dig> and il-1b in salmonella infected macrophages  <cit> ; unfortunately, we did not find any oligonucleotide set representing the ipaf gene on the affymetrix microarray. like casp <dig>  casp <dig> has been shown to process pro-il- <dig> and il-1f7b, albeit inefficiently, and to cleave casp <dig> into its active form. one important characteristic of casp <dig> is its robust induction by infg and the nfκb complex  <cit> .

genes from the transglutaminase family can be significantly induced in porcine lung during s. choleraesuis infection  <cit>  and in porcine mln during s. typhimurium infection  <cit> . in this study, tgm <dig>  tgm <dig> and tgm <dig> showed exactly the same expression pattern: activation was initiated at  <dig> hpi and peaked at  <dig> h post s. choleraesuis infection in porcine mln. the tgm <dig> gene showed a very strong induction at  <dig> hpi, with the fold change about  <dig> compared to non-infected animals by q-pcr. there is evidence that tgm <dig> is a nfκb dependent gene  <cit> , and researchers have shown that increased tgm <dig> activity can trigger nfκb activation through an unusual iκb polymerization reaction rather than iκb degradation through ikk signaling  <cit> . although transglutaminase genes have been demonstrated to elevate their expression level during inflammation and to play a physiological role in mediating defense against injury or infection in various cell types  <cit> , their role in apoptosis is not yet clear.

another important cellular immune response to infection that occurs in the mln is antigen processing and presentation, as phagocytic cells in the mln communicate with t cells for further immune activation and initiation of adaptive immune responses. three of four antigen processing related genes  exhibited an increased expression level at  <dig> hpi, which is consistent with the gene expression patterns that were observed in porcine lung during s. choleraesuis infection by  <cit> . interestingly, two markers involved in the antigen presentation activation pathway, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  did not show significant expression changes at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. these data tempt us to speculate that the host dc-mediated antigen presentation pathway was altered early after infection. antigen presentation by murine dc cells can be inhibited by s. typhimurium  <cit> , and we observed that both cd <dig> and cd <dig> were down-regulated at  <dig> hpi in s. typhimurium infected mln  <cit> . thus, we predict that lack of a strong dc-mediated antigen presentation might be a mechanism that permits s. choleraesuis to escape the porcine galt and cause a systemic infection.

one characteristic of host mln transcriptional response to s. choleraesuis is that several groups of genes with annotations for calcium binding activities changed their rna expression levels significantly during infection. calcium binding proteins are important molecules in the transduction of calcium signaling, which evoke various cellular processes, such as cell migration, cell differentiation, cell death and cell growth  <cit> . the s <dig> gene family is the largest group of calcium binding proteins; two members of this gene family, s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  were up-regulated significantly with a large fold change at  <dig> hpi relative to non-infected animals in our study. induction of s100a <dig> has been also observed in porcine peyer's patch in response to s. choleraesuis infection  <cit> . overexpression of s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> at the site of inflammation has been well described in humans, and s100a8/s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> are used as clinical laboratory markers for inflammation  <cit> . the exact biological function of these genes remains to be defined in greater detail, although there is evidence that they have anti-microbial properties  <cit> , and are involved in induction of apoptosis  <cit> . other genes with go annotation for calcium binding activity, including annexins  and transglutaminases , showed differential expression at  <dig> and/or  <dig> hpi compared to non-infected animals. calcium is an important second messenger in cells and changes in calcium pathways can evoke various cellular processes  <cit> . our report is the first to describe the strong induction of multiple calcium binding protein genes in mln of s. choleraesuis infected pigs and adds new information to host transcriptional response to gram-negative bacteria infection in pig and other species.

nfκb signaling pathway
nfκb is a latent transcription factor held in the cytoplasm through binding by its inhibitors iκb. during stimulation or infection, iκb is phosphorylated and degraded, allowing nfκb translocating into the nucleus to induce expression of many genes  <cit> . the nfκb target genes control a variety of cellular processes. both microarray and qpcr data analysis revealed that many known nfκb target genes were significantly up-regulated from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi, indicating a strong nfκb response during acute s. choleraesuis infection. both the magnitude and timing of this response was different from the response to s. typhimurium, where suppression of the nfκb pathway from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi was observed  <cit> . thus understanding the transcriptional profiles of nfκb target genes is an important step to further understand its regulatory function in bacterial infection. different activation times for nfκb target genes during stimulation has been intensively studied  <cit> . analysis of lps-stimulated mouse macrophages demonstrated that nfκb binding occurs in two distinct waves due to different rates of nfκb recruitment  <cit> . tian et al.  identified "early", "middle" and "late" expression profiles of nfκb target genes during the tnf stimulation in epithelial cells, since these genes have peak response at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively. three mechanisms for these differential expression patterns of nfκb target genes were suggested; a) early and late gene promoters are bound by nfκb complexes containing different subunits; b) there are different environments in which the nfκb binding sites are located between the early and late gene promoters or c) genes in the late group undergo an additional rate-limiting step necessary for promoter activation  <cit> .

in our study, two groups of nfκb target genes were identified, an ''early'' group and a ''late'' group. to determine the biological functions of genes in the early versus the late groups, go annotations were assigned. go terms for cytokine activity or chemokine activity were enriched in the early genes , while the late group was predominantly composed of genes with signal transduction and cell metabolism annotations. this is consistent with the functional categorization of nfκb dependent genes in ''early'' and ''late'' groups of  <cit> . the rapid induction of cytokines and chemokines during infection clearly may be important for recruiting immune cells to infection sites.

both microarray and q-pcr data suggested that nfkbia  increased its rna level slightly at  <dig> hpi. there is overwhelming evidence that demonstrates that expression of this inhibitory gene is activated by nfκb in a negative feedback loop, which provides an effective mechanism for controlling nfκb activity  <cit> . it has also been shown that nfκb dna binding activity is at its peak when nfkbia is newly synthesized  <cit> . thus, as we observe up-regulation of nfkbia and strong activation of other nfκb target genes at  <dig> hpi, we speculate that nfκb activity was initiated at  <dig> hpi and transcriptional responses to nfκb peaked at  <dig> hpi. this contrasts to the response of nfκb target genes to s. typhimurium infection, where nfkbia was not up-regulated significantly at  <dig> hpi, and many genes were suppressed from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi  <cit> .

identification of potential porcine nfκb targets
using tfm-explorer and clover, it was possible to identify promoter regions containing nfκb motifs in human genes orthologous to the porcine genes which had early  and late  response to salmonella infection. we have confidence that our analysis has identified strong candidate nfκb target genes, as the cutoff for identifying nfκb motifs within promoters was stringent, given that the non-zero possibility that groups of randomly selected genes used as the background in the tfm explorer analysis will contain some nfκb targets. some of the known targets were missed by our tfm-explorer analysis, but the input sequence window used was only  <dig>  total bases. thus for these known targets, there might be some binding sites outside of the input sequence range. however, we were able to identify 95%, 65% and 83% of the known targets in the e <dig>  l <dig> and a <dig> groups, respectively, indicating that our sensitivity was adequate to find the large majority of known target genes.

results for dna regulatory motif analysis of human orthologs for the stimulated gene groups provided evidence for  <dig> putative nfκb targets in the early group and  <dig> in the late group. these putative targets were also analyzed by go annotation to further develop our understanding of the regulatory response to salmonella infection , as performed on the known nfκb target genes , these putative target genes, including socs <dig>  scarb <dig>  cebpd, cxcl <dig>  il1rap, and casp <dig>  are involved in multiple cellular processes, including cell adhesion, regulation of transcription, immune response, and receptor activity. while there is no additional experimental evidence that these genes are direct nfκb targets, many of them have been previously reported to be involved in the response to bacterial infection  <cit> . further, the motif-finding software tfm-explorer was able to predict nearly all of these promoters as containing nfκb motifs, even when known nfκb target promoters were removed from the test set. this indicates that these putative nfκb target genes have important regulatory regions in common with bona fide nfκb targets, and that these common motifs can be found independently in the known motif data. thus, although further experimental work is needed to confirm that these genes are true nfκb targets, our analysis detecting nfκb regulatory motifs in these genes further supports the hypothesis that they constitute an important part of the early anti-bacterial infection response.

to supplement our pubmed literature search that found none of these genes were known nfκb direct targets, pathway studio  analysis was run on the complete sets of early and late genes. pathway studio identified seven early group genes having literature evidence of direct binding of nfκb to their promoter region , while in the late group only two were identified as having literature evidence of direct binding . in addition, in the early group, ten other genes were identified as having a connection with nfκb in the literature, usually sharing a common expression pattern . for the late group, an additional  <dig> were also found to have a connection with nfκb . tfm-explorer and clover found motifs at the promoters of: a) all genes with direct binding evidence; b) all but one of the nfκb-connected genes  identified in the early group ; and c) all but two  of the  <dig>  in the late group. of the genes that were predicted to contain an nfκb binding site by both programs and had evidence from pathway studio as having a direct binding relationship with nfκb, only cebpd and egr <dig> were not previously on the "known" list of targets at available websites . however, due to more recent literature evidence provided by the pathway studio software, they should be considered "known" nfκb targets. thus, this literature analysis indicates that the large majority of genes predicted to be nfκb targets , based on co-expression and motif data, have not yet been recognized as direct nfκb target genes. as this evidence is based on human promoter sequences, these genes may be regulated by nfκb during cellular responses to salmonella in other species as well, including human.

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated the host transcriptional response to s. choleraesuis infection in porcine mln using the affymetrix porcine genechip® transcriptome. a large number of differentially expressed genes  were identified and functional analyses of these genes was performed by go annotation enrichment calculations. gene expression hierarchical cluster analysis and specific pathway analysis revealed several specific features of porcine host response to infection, and expanded the gene targets for future genomic studies. comparison of the magnitude and timing of porcine mln transcriptional response to different salmonella serovars, s. choleraesuis and s. typhimurium, clearly showed a larger but later transcriptional response to s. choleraesuis. both microarray and qpcr data provided evidence of a strong nfκb-dependent host transcriptional response during s. choleraesuis infection. motif searches of orthologous human promoter sequences using tfm-explorer and clover software identified  <dig> putative novel nfκb direct targets in the early group  of genes and  <dig> in the late group . while experimental validation is needed to confirm these predicted nfκb binding sites and regulatory relationships, our study adds new data towards an understanding of the nfκb signaling pathway response to gram-negative bacterial infection which may be applicable across mammalian species.
