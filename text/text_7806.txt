BACKGROUND
cultivated roses have a very ancient history and artificial crossing led to what are today perceived as the “modern rose cultivars”. rose  belongs to the large family of the rosaceae . roses are of a high symbolic value and a great cultural importance in different societies. they are widely used as garden ornamental plants and as cut flowers. earlier domestication of roses involved selection for a number of traits, mainly involving floral quality, such as recurrent flowering, double flowers, petal color and fragrance. very little information is available on the molecular mechanisms that control these traits. this dearth of information limits the scope of rational selection for improvement of ornamental plants. rose breeding practices often involve introgression of desirable traits  from non-elite or wild varieties with varying ploidy levels into tetraploid elite cultivars. selection pressure has also led to the loss of important characters such as tolerance to biotic and/or abiotic stresses. in many crop species, molecular markers allow breeders to rapidly screen a large number of lines for markers associated with traits of interest, allowing the subsequent selection of relevant molecular markers and thus specific introgression of single genomic loci. however, in roses the lack of knowledge of the genetic basis upon which modern rose cultivars are established hampers molecular marker assisted selection.

the enormous progress that has been made towards understanding various aspects of plant development and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as defining the molecular and genetic pathways associated with these processes, has mainly involved annual model species such as arabidopsis thaliana, tobacco, rice or maize. several traits such as recurrent blooming, scent production and the production of double flowers, cannot be studied using these model species, or at least only in a limited manner. the rose represents an ideal ornamental model species to address some of these characters.

during the past few years, est sequencing using cdna libraries has been used to identify genes expressed in rosa sp <cit> . however, these rose ests remained limited to genes expressed during floral development and to date sequence information for only about  <dig> genes exists in the databases  <cit> . despite their relatively limited number, the available ests for the rose have been valuable for the identification of several novel genes associated with flower characters such as the scent related germacrene d synthase, o-methyltransferases and alcohol acetyltransferase genes  <cit> . in recent years, rosa chinensis cv. old blush was chosen as a model to develop tools for genomics and genetic transformation  <cit> . this diploid and recurrent flowering rose is a common ancestor of many commercial modern roses and has contributed to the recurrent flowering and the tea scent traits  <cit> .

here we used a combination of  <dig> and illumina sequencing technologies to establish an est database containing information on rose sequences expressed in a wide range of r. chinensis old blush tissues as well as during biotic and abiotic stresses. an in silico profile of gene expression and a reconstruction of rose metabolic pathways are presented and have been made accessible through web interface. real time quantitative rt-pcr  analyses of selected genes whose expression is specific to different organs, stress conditions and/or development stages confirmed the in silico data. similarly, rose genes associated with flower development, stamen development and fragrance show consistent in silico expression patterns.

RESULTS
rna sampling, experimental design
with the objective of increasing the available coding sequences for the rose, rna samples were prepared from various organs of r. chinensis cv. old blush plants, grown under controlled greenhouse conditions, and then used to generate unidirectional cdna libraries. to get a wide representation of genes expressed in rosa sp,  <dig> rna samples representing all rose plant organs and tissues were generated. samples include vegetative and floral meristems, buds at different steps of bursting, floral organs at different developmental stages, young  developing roots, rose hips  at early developmental stages, untreated young leaves and leaves that were subjected to biotic or abiotic stresses . leaves were water stressed or infected with botrytis cinerea lr <dig>  a necrotrophic fungal pathogen known to cause severe symptoms such as grey mold in many soft fruits and ornamentals including rose, gerbera and chrysanthemum  <cit> . infection by b. cinerea reduces the postharvest quality of rose flowers leading to substantial economic loss by growers and wholesalers  <cit> .

est sequencing and clustering, sequence annotation and database creation
to obtain a reference set of transcripts, a normalized cdna library from the above  <dig> different rose tissues and conditions was sequenced using roche gs-flx  <dig> titanium technology. about  <dig> , <dig> raw reads with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides corresponding to a total of  <dig> mb were obtained . in parallel, the  <dig> different non-normalized cdna libraries were individually barcoded and sequenced using the illumina technology. about  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> reads with a minimum length of  <dig> nucleotides corresponding to about  <dig> mb were obtained and assembled using edena   <cit> .

clustering was performed using a modified version of tgicl optimized to accommodate very large datasets  <cit> . the input sequences were both trimmed  <dig> reads and  <dig> contigs generated by edena using the short illumina reads. a total of  <dig> rose est clusters longer than  <dig> nucleotides and based on more than  <dig> sequence fragments were assembled. each fragment originated either from a  <dig> read or from an edena contig. these rosa sp. est sequences are available at the rosaseq web interface database,http://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/r.chinensis. an additional  <dig> clusters had significant matches in the botrytis cinerea genome and are available as a separate set available as a tabulated file  on the rosaseq web interface database.

 <dig> rose cdna clusters contained more than  <dig> reads and only  <dig> clusters contained over  <dig> reads, amongst which  <dig> had more than  <dig> reads . these figures indicate that normalization of the reference library from pooled tissue was particularly efficient . the set of clusters that had more than  <dig> reads contained genes known to be highly expressed, such as genes coding for proteinase inhibitors, histones, and ribosomal proteins, but also genes with more specific expression patterns such as the floral organ identity mads-box transcription factor apetala <dig>  and a putative terpenoid synthase coding gene whose expression is specific to mature floral tissue  <cit> .

the clusters’ best blastn hits in closely related rosaceae species with sequenced genomes  revealed that  <dig> clusters had a blastn hit on  <dig> fragaria vesca transcripts with a mean nucleotide identity of  <dig> %, and  <dig> clusters had hits on  <dig> prunus persica genes with an average nucleotide identity of  <dig> %. peach, strawberry and rose have relatively small genome sizes of about  <dig> mb,  <dig> mb and  <dig> mb respectively, and exhibit high synteny  <cit> . in the strawberry and peach genomes there are  <dig> and  <dig> predicted transcripts respectively, not all of them being supported by transcriptome mapping . overall, about 53% and 44% of the predicted transcripts in the strawberry and peach, respectively, are represented in our rosa sp. database. blastn  between strawberry and peach transcripts showed that  <dig> strawberry transcripts have hits on  <dig> peach transcripts  and  <dig> peach transcripts have blast hits on  <dig> strawberry transcripts . therefore, the observed slightly lower percentage of rose transcripts with hits in strawberry or peach transcripts can be due to the fact that some tissues or developmental stages are missing in our sampling combined with non exhaustive sequencing depth.

to have predictive peptide information, the  <dig> clusters were analyzed with the framedp  <cit> .  <dig> sequences were predicted to code for putative proteins which were annotated based on an automatic interproscan analysis  <cit> . the orthomcl tool was used to generate families of proteins where each family consists of orthologs or “recent” paralogs from at least two species with a whole genome sequence  <cit> . rose predicted peptides were compared to the proteomes from f. vesca, p. persica and a. thaliana. this method uses an all-against-all blast search  of each genus proteome, followed by a markov cluster algorithm. the analysis is based on a blastp with stringent parameters, followed by a computation excluding sequences with percent match cutoff lower than 80%. orthomcl analysis clustered  <dig> putative rose peptides into  <dig> protein families.  <dig> orthomcl families corresponded to unique rosa sp. genes,  <dig> families corresponded to two genes and  <dig> corresponded to more than two genes. the orthomcl families that corresponded to at least two genes represent either proteins coded by different alleles or peptides from the same protein but with no overlapping amino acid sequence. alternatively, the multiple gene families may correspond to genes subject to recent duplication events.

the second level of orthomcl analysis allowed normalized inter-species comparisons . common and specific orthomcl families  were identified in the different species. the rose protein dataset contains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> common families with the f. vesca, p. persica and a. thaliana proteomes, respectively. orthomcl analysis allowed the identification of  <dig> gene families that appeared unique to the rosa genus when compared to f. vesca, p. persica and a. thaliana. however, this number of gene families unique to rosa sp is likely to be an overestimate since certain families may not exhibit sufficient overlap with their hit from another species. we identified  <dig> peptides in the rosa dataset that share a unique ortholog in the four analyzed species, rosa, prunus, fragaria and arabidopsis. access to the protein sequences in fasta format for each orthomcl cluster is possible through the web portal http://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/r.chinensis.

gene representation in different putative pathways
pathway tool  <cit>  was applied to generate a dedicated resource using the rose peptide dataset. the putative pathways identified using semi-automated tools are available at http://pathway-tools.toulouse.inra.fr/rosacyc under rosacyc. the majority of the previously reported pathways in plants are present in the rosacyc database and can be viewed through the web portal. for example, analyses of the secondary metabolism pathways showed that the carotenoid biosynthesis superpathway is well supported in the rosacyc database by numerous putative peptides . the database provides information on peptides that were automatically attributed to a given metabolic pathway. such information can be used as a basis for further data mining, such as searches of gene expression patterns.

in silico expression patterns of rosa sp genes
a molecular tagging approach coupled to illumina sequencing was used to construct an “in silico gene expression atlas” of different rose tissues and stress conditions. the  <dig> different non-normalized cdna libraries representing various rose tissues and conditions  were individually barcoded and sequenced using the illumina technology . the  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> short reads were mapped using glint software  onto the est clusters generated from the  <dig> sequencing data and counted per cluster and per library. for each cluster, total short reads counted per library are available, providing clues towards an expression pattern for the corresponding gene. rpkm normalization  <cit>  was also performed. raw and normalized counts are available for each cluster in the database.

these data were first validated through a qpcr approach. twenty-three genes whose expression was previously reported to correlate with certain physiological characters, such as color, scent biosynthesis, pollen or egg cell ploidy level, as well as developmental characters  in rosa sp and/or in other species such as a. thaliana, were selected for qpcr expression profiling . the correlation between rnaseq/in silico data and qpcr data was assessed by calculating the pearson's product moment correlation coefficient . the statistical significance of each pearson’s correlation coefficient was assessed using the cor.test routine in r. for most analyzed genes a high correlation coefficient was observed  and only a few genes showed low correlation between qpcr and in silico data . these results suggest that our in silico data is accurate in the different tissues and experimental conditions.

in silico expression can be obtained for each of the  <dig> clusters, through the web portal rosaseq. to address whether this atlas of gene expression allows data mining to help initiating studies of specific functions in the rose, the following three important developmental processes related to flower development and scent were analyzed.

rose genes involved in flower initiation and development
we addressed the expression profiles for transcripts previously shown to exhibit flower specific expression patterns in rosa as well as for putative orthologs of well-described arabidopsis floral genes . because our dataset is fragmented due to the nature of the next generation sequencing techniques employed  <cit> , for each arabidopsis gene, more than one cluster was identified in the rosaseq dataset. interestingly, the clusters corresponding to the same gene showed similar expression patterns, thus providing another argument of the reliability of the in silico expression data.

transcripts encoding the putative floral integrator rcsoc <dig>  accumulate during the vegetative phase and the floral initiation stage. no accumulation of this putative rcsoc <dig> transcript was detected during later stages of floral development. this pattern of rcsoc <dig> expression has already been observed in rosa <cit> , suggesting a role of soc <dig> homologs during the vegetative phase and the floral transition. during the floral initiation process, transcripts of the ortholog of apetala <dig>  accumulate progressively with a maximum expression during early floral organogenesis , in agreement with previously reported data in rosa sp.  <cit> .

transcripts corresponding to putative mads box transcription factors involved in floral organ identity specification were represented in the rosaseq dataset. transcripts of the putative b class genes rctm6-clade , rcapetala <dig>  and rcpistillata  were detected at high levels in all floral samples, consistently with previously reported data  <cit> . although expressed at lower levels, transcripts encoding putative orthologs of agamous , seedstick and shatterproof  were detected in floral samples and in the cynorhodon . this result is consistent with previously reported data on the rose rhagamous  orthologs  <cit> . interestingly, the clusters corresponding to the putative shp <dig> did not show any particular enrichment in the hip library, but exhibited an expression pattern similar to that of rhag in developing stamens. this pattern resembles the previously reported expression profile of c-function genes in petunia and antirhinnum, suggesting a shared c-function between ag and shp orthologs  <cit> . as expected, putative homologs of the key floral developmental regulator genes sepallata <dig>  and sep <dig> were expressed in rose floral tissues. interestingly, rcsep <dig> and rcsep <dig> were also expressed in the cynorhodon. in agreement with this observation, the strawberry fvsep1/ <dig> subfamily genes have been shown to be involved in post-fecondation receptacle tissues development and ripening  <cit>  and lesep3-like genes are necessary for fruit ripening in tomato  <cit> .

genes expressed during stamen development
in rosa sp no information is available on the regulatory cascades of genes regulating anther development and meiosis. we performed a blast search using genes from arabidopsis known to be involved in both stamen development and male gametogenesis  <cit> . candidate clusters were readily identified in the rosaseq dataset , and their in silico expression profile was analyzed further . orthologs of genes involved in stamen development and microsporogenesis exhibited an expression in rose stamens  and flower bud  samples, and were absent from other tissues. this is the case for male sterility <dig> , aborted microspore  and defective in tapetal development and function <dig> , three genes known to be involved in tapetum development and/or microsporogenesis in arabidopsis <cit> .

orthologs of gene previously shown to be involved in early meiosis events up to microspore release in arabidopsis are also represented in the rose stamens det sample . the a <dig> ortholog showed specific expression in the rose stamens  <cit> , while homologs of aml1- <dig> and ask1;  <cit>  did not exhibit enrichment in the det sample, thus in agreement with data reporting aml and ask <dig> genes expression in both vegetative and reproductive tissues in arabidopsis <cit> .

similar to arabidopsis, orthologs of genes involved in pollen wall formation  or in sperm cell specification and division genes   <cit>  exhibited an expression enriched in the rose stamen det sample.

taken together, these analyses demonstrate that this rose gene expression atlas is a reliable source for candidate genes associated with male reproductive processes.

scent biosynthesis genes representation in the rosaseq database
we searched the database for genes previously shown to be involved in rose scent biosynthesis . transcripts coding for the putative germacrene-d synthase  accumulated at high levels during flower opening and senescence  while low expression was observed in flower bud samples . it has been reported that the germacrene-d biosynthesis occurs during anthesis and at the onset of senescence  <cit> . therefore, our in silico data shows that the accumulation of gds transcripts correlates with germacrene-d biosynthesis.

transcripts coding for two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the  <dig> ,5-trimethoxybenzene  are represented in the rosaseq dataset. the transcript coding for phloroglucinol o-methyltransferase , known to catalyze the methylation of phloroglucinol to  <dig>  dihydroxyanisole  <cit>  is highly expressed in flower buds  and stamens . the  <dig>  dihydroxyanisole is a precursor for tmb  <cit> . the transcripts corresponding to the orcinol-o-methyl transferases , known to act downstream in tmb and  <dig>  dimethoxytoluene  biosynthesis, exhibited an expression during anthesis and senescence  , thus in agreement with previously reported data  <cit> . rcoomt <dig> and rcoomt <dig> originated from a recent gene duplication and exhibit high nucleotide identity and thus their expression cannot be discriminated  <cit> .

the carotenoid cleavage oxygenases ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> have been reported to exhibit high expression levels in flowers and to be involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes, such as beta-ionone <cit> . similarly, our in silico data shows high accumulation of the putative rcccd <dig> transcripts in rose flowers , but also in vegetative organs, in agreement with previously reported data  <cit> . our in silico data shows that the putative rcccd <dig> transcripts accumulate to high levels in the flower and more specifically during flower opening and senescence , thus consistent with previously reported data  <cit> .

2-phenylethyl alcohol is another organic volatile compound responsible for typical rose scent. its synthesis occurs via two steps in rosa sp. the first step is catalyzed by the phenylacetaldehyde synthase , converting phenylalanine to phenylacetaldehyde  <cit> . phenyacetaldehyde reductase  catalyzes the second step, reducing the phenylacetaldehyde to 2-phenylethyl alcohol  <cit> . in silico data showed that rcpaas was expressed at low levels during late floral development. this result is not surprising, as r. chinensis old blush flowers do not produce phenylethanol  <cit> . according to our in silico data rcpar expression was not restricted to flowers, thus in agreement with previous reported data  <cit> .

taken together these three examples show that the rose in silico expression atlas appears accurate and provides a valuable resource for ab initio gene expression analysis. for each cluster, exhaustive annotation has been performed and can be obtained through the web portal. this annotation data, combined with expression data for each cluster will allow data mining and help initiate functional studies in the rose.

it has been reported that de novo assemblies using rnaseq are highly complex due to allelic and splicing variants and transcriptional noise  <cit>  but also because of sequencing errors and generation of chimeras. furthermore, read mis-attribution between recently duplicated genes could hamper the discrimination of expression between close paralogs or alleles. this is typically the case for the rcoomt <dig> and rcoomt <dig> transcripts, which differ only by one snp in their coding sequence  <cit> , and indeed share the same in silico pattern . although our in silico data for most analyzed genes were either validated using qpcr or coherent with previous published data, gene expression should be validated using independent and sensitive methods, such as qpcr, before functional characterization steps.

CONCLUSIONS
our de novo sequencing and analyses permitted the generation of information on at least  <dig> individual rose peptides, among which are peptides orthologous to at least  <dig> different fragaria proteins. the rosaseq web portal provides a variety of pre-existing or specifically developed tools and pre-computed searches to conduct in-depth analyses at different levels. the navigation system provided makes it possible to  visualize est cluster characteristics,  explore gene function  analyze gene and protein families  retrieve expression patterns  download results of global analyses in tabulated format. the system can be consulted in a variety of ways including via multi-criteria queries based upon annotations, keywords, similarities  as well as basic similarity searches   <cit> . results are presented with links allowing easy navigation through different sources of information.

the information on rosa sp gene sequences in this study will also prove extremely useful to generate markers for high density genetic maps and to improve synteny studies with other rosaceae, in particular fragaria. genetic mapping of rosa has been underway for several years. however, because of the limited information on gene sequences, currently, only about  <dig> markers have been mapped onto the rose genetic maps, distributed over a length of  <dig> cm on seven linkage groups  <cit> . similarly, synteny studies between rosa and other rosaceae such as strawberry has also been hampered because of the limited information on rosa sp gene sequences  <cit> .

therefore, the rosaseq database represents a comprehensive resource for transcript detection and accumulation, for genetic mapping and valuable prerequisite to the sequencing of the rose genome.
