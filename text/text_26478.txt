BACKGROUND
cystic echinococcosis  is a type of zoonosis caused by echinococcus granulosus, a canine tapeworm  <cit> . according to recent estimates,  <dig> million individuals are affected with ce and  <dig> million individuals are at risk . the life cycle of e. granulosus is complex and involves two hosts: definitive and intermediate hosts. the definitive hosts are primarily dogs, which harbor adult worms in their small intestines. the intermediate hosts, e.g., humans and herbivores, particularly sheep and cattle, get infected through the ingestion of parasite eggs released in the feces of definitive hosts or through consumption of foods contaminated with the parasite eggs  <cit> . dogs, as definitive hosts, are therefore pivotal in the transmission of ce.

one of the strategies to reduce the risk of infection is to interrupt the transmission of ce. vaccination of the definitive hosts is an effective method. as there are far fewer dogs than sheep and cattle in endemic areas, far fewer animals consequently need to be vaccinated. however, a limitation of vaccination is that the immune modulatory mechanisms of e. granulosus are not fully understood. the immune modulatory mechanisms of the parasite might involve antigenic proteins and excretory-secretory  products released by the parasite  <cit> . the surveillance of e. granulosus infections in definitive hosts through sensitive diagnostic procedures is of paramount importance; coproantigen detection and arecoline purgation are not sufficiently sensitive. therefore, there is an urgent need to identify immune markers that can be used in diagnosis and vaccine development. the identification of es products and antigenic proteins could provide valuable insights into host-parasite interactions and improve the repertoire of candidate proteins used in immunodiagnoses, vaccination, and therapy. however, e. granulosus adult worms have received little attention; most studies have focused on the pre-adult stage of the parasite . the proteomic profile of es products and antigenic proteins from adult e. granulosus remain to be elucidated.

in this study, we investigated the es products and antigenic proteins of e. granulosus adult worms from infected dogs using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight  mass spectroscopy. the results obtained from this study are crucial for understanding the survival mechanisms of e. granulosus and host-parasite interactions. furthermore, the results could assist in the development of vaccine antigens, drug targets, and immunodiagnosis markers.

discussion
in this study, we performed the first proteomic analysis of es products from adult e. granulosus. enolase was the most abundant es product enolase has been described as a multifunctional surface protein and an es product of parasites; it exhibits host-interacting properties and is involved in invasion . enolase is likely to play an important role in e. granulosus-host interactions and parasite evasion mechanisms via the immunomodulation of the host immune system. the second most abundant es product was cyclophilin, which plays a role in parasite development and host-parasite interactions  <cit> . furthermore, cyclophilin is a target compound for the immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporine a .

actin and paramyosin, cytoskeletal proteins, were other es products. similar results have been obtained in other parasites . the presence of these proteins may indicate parasite damage or death; however, it is more likely that these proteins are products of tegument shedding. the continuous shedding of the parasite tegument is thought to release components that aid the parasite in evading an effective immune response  <cit> .

an antioxidant defense mechanism is another form of parasite survival. among the es products identified, only thioredoxin peroxidase was involved in redox homeostasis. this enzyme plays a major role in protecting the adult worms from oxidative damage. this result is in accordance with the findings of a study performed of hydatid cyst fluid  that contained es products from e. granulosus protoscoleces  <cit> .

metacestodes , protoscoleces, and adult worms are different developmental stages of e. granulosus. the hcf is a reservoir of es products from both the germinal layer and protoscoleces. compared with hcf  <cit>  and es products from protoscoleces  <cit> , the es products from adult worms comprise different proteins. some of the proteins in this study have not been identified in hcf, including enolase, malate dehydrogenase, gst, and cyclophilin. similarly, some of the proteins have not been identified in the es products from protoscoleces, including paramyosin, small hsp p <dig>  and gst. in another study, we observed that the es products from e. granulosus adult worms failed to induce dendritic cell maturation and cytokine production ; this result, however, is in contrast with the finding that hcf induces dendritic cell activation  <cit> . these differences could be attributed to the different proteins in es products and hcf; however, this needs to be confirmed.

the search for antigenic proteins by 2de immunoblots contributed to the identification of  <dig> parasite proteins that were recognized in the serum of e. granulosus-infected dogs. nine of these proteins  were previously identified in e. granulosus and e. multilocularis human infections . the other three proteins  were identified in this study for the first time. some of these proteins have potential in vaccine development, such as paramyosin. paramyosins, which are multifunctional modulators of the host immune response, play a role in binding complement components, immunoglobulins, and secreted components of cellular immune response . paramyosin has been proposed by who/tdr as a vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis and has shown some protection, which may suggest a potential for this protein in the treatment of e. granulosus infections .

recently, the protein profile of e. granulosus adult worms has been analyzed by two dimensional lc-ms  <cit> . in addition to proteins that had been reported in that work, we identified two novel proteins of this parasite, which has increased the known repertoire of the parasitic protein profile and demonstrates the value of our experimental approaches for the proteomic analysis of e. granulosus proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study investigated the es products and antigenic proteins of e. granulosus adult worms from infected dogs. the results obtained from this study extend the existing proteomic data regarding e. granulosus and could assist in the development of vaccine antigens, drug targets, and immunodiagnostic markers.
