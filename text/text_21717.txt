BACKGROUND
mitochondria are maternally inherited cell organelles that contain a circular genome of about 14– <dig> kb in bilaterian animals; the mitochondrial  dna in metazoans usually codes for  <dig> proteins,  <dig> transfer rnas , two ribosomal rnas  and small  ribosomal subunit) and contains a non-coding control region  of variable length  <cit> . the loss of genes in mitochondria is a commonly recognized and ongoing process in eukaryotes  <cit> . eukaryotic mt genomes generally contain fewer genes than their free-living bacterial ancestors since the majority of the original mt proteins are now encoded in the nucleus; this is either caused by the transfer of the original mt gene to the nucleus or by the replacement of its function by a preexisting nuclear gene  <cit> . the protein-coding genes which have been retained in mt genomes are mainly those involved in electron transport and phosphorylation, e.g., cytochrome b  and the cytochrome oxidases   <cit> , but their number is variable ranging from three in the malaria parasite plasmodium falsciparum   <cit>  to  <dig> in reclinomonas americana, the earliest branching aerobic protist   <cit> .

in addition to gene loss, the positions of genes relative to each other exhibit frequent rearrangement. while the arrangement of mt genes is conserved in some lineages of arthropods  <cit> , it is highly variable in others  <cit> . in particular, the positions of the relatively small genes for trnas frequently vary within and among taxa. the arrangement of the hypothetical ancestor of arthropods is conserved in the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus  <cit> , whereas most insect genomes differ from the ancestral state by the location of one trna  <cit> .

oribatid mites  are soil-dwelling animals that occur in high numbers in almost all terrestrial ecosystems  <cit> . a characteristic feature of this group is the unusually high percentage of parthenogenetic taxa  and the co-occurrence of sexuality and parthenogenesis in the same habitat  <cit> . oribatid mite fossils date back at least  <dig> million years  <cit>  and therefore a number of parthenogenetic lineages of oribatid mites join bdelloid rotifers as "ancient asexual scandals"  <cit> . since oribatid mites provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of sex, recently much attention has been paid to their phylogeny and radiation  <cit> . however, studies based on single genes such as the ribosomal 18s region , the heat shock protein  <dig> , the elongation factor 1α  or cox <dig> could neither satisfactorily resolve phylogenetic relationships  <cit>  nor clarify the number of parthenogenetic radiations  <cit>  nor delineate the age of the group  <cit> . since oribatid mites apparently are among the first terrestrial animals  and species exhibit different evolutionary mutation rates, lineages are probably vulnerable to long-branch attraction in phylogenetic reconstruction. therefore, further markers, such as gene rearrangements in mt genomes, are needed to resolve phylogenetic relationships of oribatid mite lineages, among mite taxa  and among chelicerates in general.

until now no complete mt genome of an oribatid mite species was available although mitochondrial genomes have become invaluable phylogenetic markers during the last few years. complete mt genome sequences are now known for about  <dig> arthropods, including  <dig> chelicerates with  <dig> species of acari. these  <dig> acarine genomes represent ten species of ticks , two mesostigmate mites  and three species of the genus leptotrombidium . in contrast to other arthropods and metazoa in general  <cit> , the arrangement of the mt genes differs markedly within and among taxa of acari. while the ancestral state of arthropods is retained in soft- and prostriate-hard ticks  <cit> , there is a major rearrangement shared by all metastriate hard ticks  <cit> , and there are numerous, lineage specific rearrangements in the mesostigmate species, such as varroa destructor  <cit>  and metaseiulus occidentalis  <cit> , and also in the prostigmate mite genus leptotrombidium  <cit> . since the deep phylogeny of acari, especially within the large subgroup of acariformes, is still controversial, synapomorphic rearrangements of mt genes, if present, would likely allow new insights into phylogenetic relationships.

we report the first mt genome for an oribatid mite, steganacarus magnus . the mt genome of s. magnus is compared with that of other mites and with basal chelicerates to clarify phylogenetic relationships within acari and chelicerata in total. we show that the mt genome of s. magnus is slightly rearranged and lacks  <dig> trna genes.

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome organization
the mt genome of s. magnus is the first genome published for the large mite group of sarcoptiformes. the complete mt genome is circular and consists of  <dig>  bp . it encodes  <dig> protein-coding genes, two rrna genes, six trna genes and includes a large non-coding control region as well as several size-variable intergene spacer regions . genes are encoded on both strands which is typical for arthropods. compared to the mt arrangement of the ancestral arthropod, which is conserved in limulus polyphemus  <cit> , the genome of s. magnus is slightly rearranged: instead of nad1-rrnl-rrns-lnr-nad <dig>  the gene arrangement is nad2-rrnl-nad1-rrns-lnr ; all translocated genes have kept their original orientation. furthermore, the genes for trna-leu, -trp, -gln and -ser are translocated to new positions with trna-ser, -leu, and -trp also being inverted relative to the ground plan; only trna-his and -pro remained in their original location.

rearrangements of genes in mt genomes are useful markers for deep splits within phylogenies  <cit>  although the relative frequency of rearrangements varies among lineages  <cit> . for example, drosophila  and daphnia  share the same mt rearrangement although they diverged 400– <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and the mt genome of soft ticks remained unchanged for a similar time period  <cit> . in contrast, gene arrangements in mt genomes of lice are highly variable  <cit> , and in the mite genus leptotrombidium they even differ between species  <cit> . in general, in mt genomes of acari a number of rearrangements have occurred. while the ground plan is retained in soft- and prostriate-hard ticks  <cit> , the arrangement of mt genes in mesostigmata , especially metaseiulus occidentalis is strongly derived. notably, the metaseiulus mt genome is the largest within chelicerates, even though nad <dig> and nad <dig> were lost, due to the duplication of many of the remaining genes  <cit> .

fossils of oribatid mites are known from devonian sediments and molecular studies suggest that their origin may predate this record by ~ <dig> mya . further, oribatids probably diverged from other acariform mites, such as leptotrombidium, about  <dig> mya ago . the mt genomes of leptotrombidium and s. magnus differ markedly; they only share the gene boundaries cox1-cox <dig>  nad6-cob and atp8-atp6-cox <dig> . however, since these boundaries are also present in the ground plan of chelicerate mt genomes there are no derived arrangements supporting the common ancestry of acariformes.

protein-coding genes and nucleotide composition
all  <dig> protein-coding genes typically present in arthropods could be identified in the mt genome of s. magnus. they start with the mt start codons att, atg, ata and atc . six genes  terminate with incomplete stop codons  while all others terminate with either taa, tag or ttt . in cox <dig>  which is flanked by two other protein-coding genes , no stop codon is present; as shown for sets of protein-coding genes in anabrus simplex  a stem-loop formation in the secondary structure of the transcribed polycistronic mrna probably functions as terminator  <cit> .

the percentage nucleotide composition of the mt -strand is a =  <dig> , c =  <dig> , g =  <dig>  and t =  <dig> . therefore, there are approximately equal numbers of each complementary nucleotide pairs  but a strong at-bias is present. the pattern for all protein-coding genes is also strongly at-biased but with a much higher t than a content . skews calculated for neutral fourfold degenerate sites do not indicate consistent asymmetric strand bias . genes encoded on the -strand show either neutral , positive  or negative cg-skew . the majority of genes encoded on the -strand are positive cg-skewed  . the at skew at fourfold degenerate sites is only positive for nad <dig> and nad <dig>  but negative for all other protein-coding genes .

a reversal of the strand bias is usually explained by an inversion of the control region  which contains the origin of replication and translation  <cit> . during replication the two different strands - and -strand) are exposed to different mutational pressures, typically causing distinct skews since one strand remains longer in the single-stranded state than the other  <cit> . therefore, the lnr likely functions as a key region for determining strand bias and an inversion results in a complete reversal of the strand nucleotide composition over time  <cit> . in s. magnus most genes encoded on the -strand show a negative cg-skew at fourfold degenerate third codon positions which is inverted to the common pattern and probably indicates a reversal of the lnr. on the other hand, the presence of neutral or positive skewed genes may indicate that this reversal is of recent origin and consequently the process of inverting nucleotide skew is not completed so far.

the absence of a distinct strand bias can also be explained by the recent inversion of single genes which homogenize general patterns of asymmetry  <cit> . however, since no inversions of protein-coding genes were found in s. magnus, the absence of a distinct asymmetrical skew in the genome awaits explanation.

putative control region
the major non-coding region , which presumably functions as the mitochondrial control region, is  <dig> bp in length and located between rrns and cox <dig> . there are additional non-coding intergenic regions ranging in size from 2– <dig> bp. these regions were blasted and checked for trna genes but could not be assigned to any functional gene.

the relative location of the lnr varies greatly among invertebrates with the ancestral pattern of arthropods being rrns-lnr-trna-ile  <cit> . it also varies in length mostly due to different numbers of sequence repeats, and length heteroplasmy within individuals has also been recorded  <cit> . there was no length heteroplasmy in s. magnus but two inverted sequence repeat regions, each with a length of  <dig> bp, were present at positions 133– <dig>  and 830– <dig> . the region before repeat  <dig> contains four stem-loop structures at positions 3– <dig>  32– <dig>  60– <dig> and 82– <dig> ; the region between the two repeats contains 10– <dig> stem-loop structures depending on differences in folding. none of the hairpin structures is associated with a poly-a or poly-t stretch which would mark the origin of replication  in insect mt genomes  <cit>  nor with a tata- or gat-motif as present in other arthropods  <cit> . since the or typically is close to the gene of rrns and repeat regions are posterior to it  <cit> , we assume the first region to be the or of the mt genome of s. magnus.

in the mesostigmate mite m. occidentalis the stem-loop structure which probably represents the or comprises only at nucleotides but does not have any similarity to sequences from other chelicerates  <cit> . the lnr of the mite v. destructor includes several repetitions of a 157-bp motif and eleven sites of potential stem-loop structures have been identified close to it  <cit> . in the genus leptotrombidium, the closest relative to s. magnus for which an mt genome is sequenced, the lnr is duplicated  in l. akamushi and l. deliense and four copies are present in l. pallidum  <cit> . although mt lnr possess several distinct structural features , their use for evolutionary studies is limited by the high variability of the sequence and the possibility of length heteroplasmy within individuals  <cit> .

rrna genes
the large subunit of the rrna  is  <dig> bp in length  which is a bit shorter than in other mite species . the 5'-end starts three nucleotides apart from nad <dig> -strand). the 3'-end was difficult to assign since parts of the last stem-loop structure can be included in the gene for trna-ser . the gene for the small subunit  is  <dig> bp in length and located between nad <dig> and the control region . both ribosomal subunits have a similar at content to the protein-coding genes and both are encoded on the -strand as in most species of arthropods and chelicerates   <cit> . in contrast, in the mt genome of the closely related genus leptotrombidum as well as in m. occidentalis both ribosomal rna genes are encoded on the -strand -strand)  <cit> .

the secondary structures of the rrna genes in steganacarus differ from those published for leptotrombidium  <cit>  but are more similar to those published for insects . the leptotrombium rrns gene lacks helices  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the compound helices 19–20– <dig> and 39–40– <dig> as depicted have a very different secondary structure from that found in other arthropods  <cit> . in contrast, most of the helices found in arthropod rrns genes are present in steganacarus, but helices  <dig> and  <dig> are absent. however, helix  <dig> has a large loop such that there is limited difference in sequence length in this region between steganacarus and arthropods which possess these helices; this is similar to the structure found in hymenoptera  <cit> . helix  <dig> is greatly shortened relative to other species, consisting of just  <dig> paired bases compared to up to  <dig> in leptotrombidium  <cit> . the loop regions between helices  <dig> and 39–40– <dig> are also greatly reduced consisting of just  <dig> bp on the 5' side and  <dig> bp on the 3'; this is in contrast to insects where these loops consist of a dozen or more bases on each side.

similarly, the rrnl gene of leptotrombidium entirely lacks domain i , helices c <dig>  cd <dig>  d <dig> and h <dig> and the structure of the compound helices d17-d18-d <dig> is unique to leptotrombidium. the steganacarus rrnl secondary structure is again more similar to that of other arthropods, domain i is absent but helices c <dig>  cd <dig> and d <dig> are present and d17-d18-d <dig> has a more canonical structure. helix g <dig> is greatly reduced, consisting of just  <dig> paired stem bases and  <dig> loop bases, relative to both leptotrombidium,  <dig> stem and  <dig> loop bases, and insects, up to  <dig> stem and  <dig> loop bases in manduca  <cit> . the 3' end of the rrnl molecule is ambiguous, bases 10346– <dig> either form the trna gene for serine or they form helices h <dig> and the 3' side of h <dig>  without an analysis of the mature transcribed genes it is not possible to determine which form is more likely in the mature molecule. helix h <dig> is not present in all arthropod rrnl genes found in hymenoptera and lepidoptera but is absent from coleoptera and leptotrombidium and its function in the mature rrna is unclear. accordingly, we present both possibilities, helices h <dig> and h <dig> are included in figure  <dig> with the region which potentially forms the trna shown in a box, while trna-ser is included in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

trna genes
out of the  <dig> trna genes typically present in arthopods only six are present in s. magnus. out of these six trnas, only two have kept their original position  while all others are translocated relative to the ground plan. further, trna-leu overlaps the nad <dig> gene by four nucleotides and trna-trp overlaps with the 3'-end of cob by  <dig> nucleotides ; as described above trna-ser presumably forms part of the rrnl gene at the 3'-end . remarkably, although  <dig> trna genes have been lost, the mt genome size of s. magnus  is comparable to those of leptotrombidium deliense  and l. akamushi   <cit>  which is due to a larger lnr and more intergenic spacer regions.

all present trnas differ remarkably from the typical cloverleaf structure: in trna-leu and -ser the d-stem and -loop are missing and the tψc-stem is short with only two complementary base pairs . in contrast, the homologous trna for leucine in l. pallidum and m. occidentalis lacks the tψc- instead of the d-arm  <cit> ; while the structure of trna-ser in l. pallidum is similar to that of s. magnus, it differs in m. occidentalis which lacks the tψc-arm.

the trnas for histidine, proline, tryptophan and glutamine lack the tψc-stem and -loop but posses a complete dhu-stem with a smaller loop in trna-trp and a larger in trna-gln ; this lack of the tψc-arm is also present in l. pallidum  <cit>  and m. occidentalis  <cit> .

all trnas present in s. magnus are shorter than the average length of arthropod trnas  and are highly modified. the loss of the tψc-arm and the replacement by a size-variable loop was first recognized in nematode trnas  <cit>  and can also be found in m. occidentalis  <cit> , l. pallidum  <cit>  and other chelicerates including scorpions  <cit>  and spiders  <cit> . further, a study on truncated trnas in arachnida revealed that the trnas for proline, histidine and glutamine have experienced the greatest number of independent tψc-arm losses in arachnids whereas tψc-arm loss in genes for arginine, lysine and methione have occurred only once and is synapomorphic for opisthothele spiders  <cit> . however, arachnids seem to have a compensatory mechanism that allows truncated trnas to function during translation and the interaction with the ribosome  <cit> .

while the two rrna genes are present in all eukaryotic genomes  <cit> , the number of trna genes varies markedly among taxa. no trnas are present in the protists plasmodium falciparum  and trypanosoma brucei   <cit>  but up to  <dig> are present in reclinomonas americana   <cit> . the loss of mt trna genes may be facilitated by the fact that the proteins with which they interact during translation in the mitochondria are encoded in the nucleus  <cit> . furthermore, the mutation rate of mt encoded trna genes is about five-fold higher than that of nuclear genes which experience strong purifying selection  <cit> . since trnas are encoded in the nucleus anyway and selective pressure favors the reduction of mt genome size  <cit> , it is likely that s. magnus simply lost its trna genes instead of transferring them to the nucleus. however, the differences in the genetic code between nucleus  and mitochondria  would probably argue for two sets of trnas or alternatively some modifications of the trna-amino acyl transferases are needed to treat each trna isotype differently in the two different compartments.

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic analyses performed on a concatenated dataset of all protein-coding genes  included three outgroup species , penaeus monodon , lithobius forficatus ), one species of solifugae, xiphosura, and ricinulei, two scorpiones species, four species of araneae and acariformes and twelve species of parasitiformes . all major groups, notably parasitiformes, acariformes, araneae and scorpiones, were monophyletic and supported by moderate  to high  support values. the sister-group relationship of scorpiones and araneae was only supported by posterior probablities .

the newly sequenced s. magnus formed the closest relative of the prostigmate mite genus leptotrombidium which was expected following previous studies  <cit> . as in previous studies  <cit>  the ricinuleid species pseudocellus pearsei clustered as sister-group of acariformes but was only supported by bayesian posterior probabilities . in contrast to the study of fahrein et al.  <cit>  the acariformes/ricinulei clade did not form the sister-group of araneae but of parasitiformes; however, the support for both possibilities is similar weak .

for a broader investigation of chelicerate phylogeny mt dna data of key taxa such as opiliones, pseudoscorpiones, palpigradi, uropygi and amblypygi are missing. even for a complete study of acari phylogeny many taxa remain to be sampled; no complete mt genome is available for astigmata, endeostigmata or opilioacarida.

while using mt dna for phylogenetic studies, a reversal of nucleotide strand bias or a reversal of nucleotide bias of single genes  can be misleading for phylogenetic relationships by causing long-branch attraction artifacts  <cit> . further, since mt genomes evolve at higher rates than the nuclear genome  <cit> , saturation of the phylogenetic signal can also be problematic in deep split phylogenies. species exhibiting unusual genomic features such as complicated gene arrangements or multiple control regions as well as species with small body sizes or parasitic lifestyle are also vulnerable to long branches  <cit> . collectively, acari exhibit all these features and so a heavy sampling effort will be necessary to reliably use mt genomics in mite phylogenetic studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the first complete mt genome for an oribatid mite  is a typical circular molecule and comprises all protein-coding genes typically present in metazoa and two genes for the ribosomal subunits. compared to the putative ground pattern of arthropods the genome is rearranged, affecting the genes nad <dig>  rrnl, rrns, and nad <dig>  further, the genome of s. magnus lacks all but six trnas, but is comparable in size with genomes of the closely related genus leptotrobidium; the close relationship of both of these acariform mites was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using all mt protein-coding genes. since mt gene arrangements vary strongly among mite species and no full mt genomes are available for astigmata, endeostigmata and opilioacarida, the use of mtdna rearrangements for phylogenetic studies is limited at present, especially since gene rearrangements in the studied acari species do not show a distinct phylogenetic pattern. however, the growing number of published genomes and the better understanding of rearranging mechanisms make mt genomes promising markers for resolving phylogenetic relationships of acarine lineages and chelicerata in general.
