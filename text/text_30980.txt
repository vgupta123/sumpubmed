BACKGROUND
there are many non-cereal monocots of agronomic , horticultural , and potential biofuel  importance. successful transformation of these species requires an understanding of how their gene expression is controlled by promoter elements such as introns.

introns have been found to significantly stimulate gene expression. dicot introns have been used to transform dicot plants, and levels of intron-mediated expression  in leaves ranged from 2–20×  <cit> . monocot introns have been shown to enhance gene expression in monocots 20–100×  <cit> . most of the studies with monocots have been transient transformation studies using callus cells or protoplasts of cereal monocots rather than stable transformation of plants to characterize expression within specific plant tissues. there have been a few transient transformation studies showing ime of non-cereal monocots  using introns  isolated from either cereal monocots or dicots  <cit> . half of the introns tested by vain et al.  <cit>  showed different results on transient expression for maize and bluegrass indicating a difference between cereal and non-cereal monocots.

this is the first study using an intron isolated from the promoter of a non-cereal monocot and evaluating its effect on expression in both a dicot and a monocot plant. previously we had reported that the non-cereal intron from the gubq <dig> promoter from gladiolus enhanced gus expression in suspension cells  <cit> . it is critical to verify ime using transformed plants as ime has been shown to differ dramatically depending on the tissue it is expressed in  <cit> . the sugarcane ubiquitin promoter including its intron expressed gus at high levels in sugarcane callus, but there was no expression in plants of sugarcane  <cit> . results in this study show that ime occurs in both a dicot and non-cereal monocot plant with the gubq <dig> intron. this information will contribute to our understanding of factors controlling gene expression in a non-cereal monocot and can be used when genetic engineering applications require high levels of expression.

RESULTS
southern hybridization
gladiolus and arabidopsis plants were transformed with the uida gene under control of either a  <dig>  kb gubq <dig> promoter , a 5′end of gubq <dig> that is lacking the intron , or the camv 35 s promoter . southern hybridization confirmed integration of the uida gene in gladiolus plants . hind iii used for digesting the genomic dna of gladiolus and arabidopsis cuts once immediately 5′ of the gubq <dig> or camv 35 s promoter region. three plants of gladiolus that were shown by the southern to be independently transformed had 2– <dig> copies of the uida gene under control of g1- <dig>  gladiolus plant lines transformed with the uida gene under control of either g1- <dig> or camv 35 s were also multicopy with 4– <dig> and 3– <dig> copies, respectively, of the transgene.

approximately 30% of the transformed arabidopsis plants contained a single copy of the uida gene, and only those with a single copy of the uida gene were used in this study .

gus expression
histochemical staining showed gus expression throughout the leaves of transgenic gladiolus plants with the camv 35 s and g1- <dig> promoters . high levels of specific gus activity were comparable with the gubq <dig> and camv 35 s promoters in leaves of gladiolus from plants transformed with either the g1- <dig> or 35 s promoters . specific gus activity measured in leaves of transgenic gladiolus plants with g1- <dig> was significantly lower than that of g1- <dig> plants indicating the importance of the intron on expression . gus expression was not evident from histochemical staining in leaves and roots of gladiolus plants transformed with the g1- <dig> promoter, and light blue staining indicative of gus expression was present in callus found at the basal meristem region of g1- <dig> plants . a quantitative comparison of gus activity in leaf, root, and callus confirmed the low level of gus expression in both types of organs and callus tissue with the g1- <dig> promoter and the high level of expression with the g1- <dig> promoter .

arabidopsis showed higher levels of specific gus activity with the gubq <dig> promoter than the camv 35 s promoter . histochemical staining showed gus expression throughout the entire leaves and roots of transgenic arabidopsis plants with the camv 35 s and g1- <dig> promoters . staining occurred at the periphery in some of the leaves of arabidopsis that had the g1- <dig> and g1- <dig> promoters. the blue staining was considerably lighter in arabidopsis transformed with the g1- <dig> promoter as compared to the dark blue staining seen in g1- <dig> plants. the specific gus activity was negligible in leaves with the g1- <dig> promoter confirming the importance of the gubq <dig> intron to expression in arabidopsis .

rna and translation efficiency
the two constructs, g1- <dig> and its intronless version g1- <dig>  produce identical mrnas that have the same nucleotide sequence in the 5′ leader. in leaves of transgenic gladiolus plants the level of uida mrna was two-fold higher with the promoter only and its 5′utr  as compared to the  <dig>  kb promoter that included the intron  . in comparison, arabidopsis leaves transformed with g1- <dig> had significantly higher levels of uida mrna than leaves with g1- <dig> . the intron affected the level of uida mrna in arabidopsis but not in gladiolus. splicing of the intron appeared to be occur efficiently from the gubq <dig> mrna in leaves of gladiolus. the trend in translation efficiency was similar for the two species . in both gladiolus and arabidopsis the highest translation efficiency was with the  <dig>  kb promoter , and efficiency was negligible with the promoter and 5′utr .

the act <dig> intron isolated from arabidopsis was substituted with the gladiolus intron in the g1- <dig> construct to determine the effect of a dicot intron rather than a non-cereal monocot intron on transient gfp expression and translation in tobacco. although the arabidopsis act <dig> intron did not increase gfp expression to the same extent as the gladiolus intron, expression with the act <dig> intron was approximately half the level of g1- <dig> , and there was a corresponding increase in gfp mrna level . the translation efficiency of the gubq <dig> promoter was higher when either intron, the arabidopsis act <dig> or gladiolus gubq <dig> intron were present . the level of gfp protein produced in tobacco was found to be significantly higher with the gladiolus gubq <dig> intron as compared to the act <dig> intron .

it appears that in tobacco the arabidopsis act <dig> intron was not spliced as efficiently as the gladiolus gubq <dig> intron . two bands were produced after rt-pcr with  <dig> primers for amplification of the arabidopsis act <dig> intron . the 365 bp band is expected when the act <dig> intron is spliced out, and the second 910 bp band indicates that  <dig> splicing was incomplete. an actin gene specific to each species analyzed was used as a reference gene to verify rt-pcr performance and the possibility of dna contamination . rna samples were not contaminated with dna because only one band was present for actin. a second actin band would have resulted from dna that did not have its actin intron spliced out .

discussion
gus expression in gladiolus and arabidopsis was dependent on the presence of the gubq <dig> intron. sequencing of this intron showed that its 68% au content is more similar to that of dicots that contain a minimum of 60% au and an average of 74% au in comparison to cereal monocot introns that average 59% au, and this may explain why the intron functioned well in arabidopsis and tobacco. splicing of introns is more precise in dicots than in cereal monocots, and the at nucleotides are thought to facilitate splicing in dicots  <cit> . more recently rose et al.  <cit>  examined intron sequences in the arabidopsis thaliana genome and concluded that sequences that enhance gene expression are dispersed throughout an intron, and these specific sequences are conserved between monocots and dicots. deletion of the intron from three polyubiquitin promoters, ubq3ubq <dig>  and ubq <dig> isolated from arabidopsis, resulted in a  <dig> –3× decrease in gene expression in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . omission of the intron from the gubq <dig> promoter resulted in a much more dramatic effect, no expression, in arabidopsis leaves as compared to its omission from the arabidopsis-derived polyubiquitin promoters.

the role of the intron in controlling gene expression is typically more critical in cereal monocots than dicots, and it appears to be critical in leaves of this non-cereal monocot, gladiolus. levels of gus expression were reduced to background in rice when the promoter’s intron was absent from the rice act <dig> and rubq <dig> promoters  <cit> .

studies with other non-cereal monocots have found that some, but not all, introns derived from cereal monocots may stimulate gene expression, and dicot-derived introns result in relatively lower levels of ime. a transient transformation study using lily and tulip leaves showed a decrease in gus expression when the maize adh <dig> intron was included with the camv 35 s promoter, and this same result occurred in sugarcane  <cit> . chloramphenical acetyltransferase expression increased in protoplasts of panicum and pennisetum 23–28× following transient transformation with the camv 35 s promoter and first intron of the maize shrunken- <dig> locus  <cit> . this same intron resulted in higher, 91×, cat expression in maize protoplasts. the maize wx, maize bz, rice act1adh1sshpetunia chs, and maize ubi <dig> introns were tested in bluegrass suspension cells using transient transformation, and the highest level of gus expression, a 26x increase, was with the maize ubi intron  <cit> . transient expression using embryogenic cells of banana was enhanced 100×, 300x, and 10× when the maize ubi <dig>  rice act <dig>  and sugarcane rbcs introns were included with the banana bunchy top virus dna- <dig> promoter, respectively  <cit> . the maize ubi <dig> intron with banana bunchy top virus dna  <dig> promoter was used for stable transformation, and banana plants had levels of gus expression similar to that of the camv 35 s promoter  <cit> . it is difficult to predict the level of ime for each non-cereal monocot species and a particular intron. the maize ubi <dig> and rice act <dig> promoters showed very low levels of transient gus expression in gladiolus <cit>  possibly because of their introns, yet these two introns showed high levels of ime, 100–300×, in banana and only 26 × in bluegrass.

rose and beliakoff  <cit>  have shown ime using either of the first two pat <dig> introns. because the levels of uida mrna increased during ime, but the rate of transcription remained constant, ime with the pat <dig> introns was concluded to occur through a post-transcription mechanism. in a later study using arabidopsis, the position of the tryptophan biosynthesis  <dig>  and ubq <dig> intron was varied in the coding and 3’utr regions  <cit> . both introns at all locations stimulated gus expression more than mrna accumulation. results from this study support a model for introns operating at both the level of transcription and post-transcription. rose’s recent study of ime  <cit>  using hybrid introns in either their normal orientation or reverse complement resulted in a model of ime that acts at the level of the transcribed dna rather than the nascent rna. samadder et al.  <cit>  found that ime with the 5′utr intron of the rice rubi <dig> gene increased the gene’s mrna level 20x and stimulated the intron’s transcription 2x in a nuclear run-on experiment. their results support both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of the rice rubi <dig> intron, and suggest that the main effect was at the level of post-transcription. in both gladiolus and arabidopsis the 5′utr-intron stimulated translation efficiency supporting the effect of the 5′utr-intron at the post-transcriptional level.

in mammalian cells, genes containing an intron generally show more expression than the same genes lacking an intron. wiegand et al.  <cit>  did experiments to separate the effects of intron removal and exon junction complex formation on gene expression and found that the components of the exon junction complex function to activate splicing in human cells. removal of an intron will not increase gene expression without exon junction complex formation. an increased amount of protein translated in mammalian cells was associated with splicing of the protein’s mrna  <cit> . in our experiments with gfp expression in tobacco, possibly the exon junction complex did not occur in all of the gfp rnas resulting in incomplete splicing and less translation than with the gubq <dig> 5′utr-intron. future research on the role of the exon junction complex formation in plant cells will be useful to elucidating the mechanism of enhanced gene expression associated with intron splicing.

CONCLUSIONS
levels of gus expression were comparable in leaves of gladiolus and arabidopsis under the g1- <dig> and camv 35 s promoters. removal of the 5′utr-intron decreased expression in leaves of both species to background levels demonstrating the contribution of the 5′utr-intron to expression. translation efficiency was increased in both species with the presence of the 5′utr-intron.
