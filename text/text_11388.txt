BACKGROUND
nasopharyngeal carcinoma associated gene  <dig>  was located on chromosome 9p21- <dig>  <cit> . in previous studies, results from various analysis including rt-pcr, dot hybridization and northern blot showed that the mrna levels of ngx <dig> were significantly lower in colorectal carcinoma tissues with lymph node or distant metastasis than that in paracancerous tissues  <cit> . and its mrna expression level in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues was also lower than that in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues  <cit> . some studies demonstrated that ngx <dig> may play an important role in egfr/k-ras/jnk/c-jun/cyclind <dig> signal pathway and wnt/β-catenin signal pathway  <cit> . overexpression of ngx <dig> gene in colon cancer cells was able to inhibit cell growth and cell cycle progression from g <dig> to s phase  <cit> . as a transmembrane protein, ngx <dig> protein has been demonstrated to regulate the transduction of extracellular signals into cytoplasm and nucleus through binding with the membrane cytoskeleton-organizing protein ezrin by its cytoplasmic domain. and it is also involved in cellular adhesion, invasion, motility and metastasis  <cit> . but its transcriptional regulation remains unknown. we have previously reported a region spanning from - <dig> to +276 bp as the proximal promoter of ngx <dig> gene  <cit> . in this report, we defined the minimal promoter of ngx <dig> gene in a 186-bp region, and explored the role of egr- <dig> in positive regulating of ngx <dig> expression in colon cancer cells. these results will help to further understand and uncover the bio-functions of ngx <dig> gene involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma.

methods
cell culture
the human colon carcinoma cell lines, ht- <dig>  sw <dig> and sw <dig>  were from american type culture collection . cos <dig> cells were provided by the cancer research institute, xiangya school of medicine, central south university . all cells were cultured in rpmi <dig> medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum  and incubated at 37°c in a humidified incubator with 5% co <dig> 

bioinformatics
potential binding sites of transcription factors within the promoter region spanning from - <dig> to +100 bp of ngx <dig> gene were analyzed by matinspector professional .

luciferase- reporter vectors and assay
in order to define the minimal promoter of ngx <dig>  a series of 5’ or 3’ deletion fragments generated from the proximal promoter construct pgl3-159/+ <dig> were successfully amplified by pcr using the primers listed in table  <dig>  all the primers included 9-bp noncomplementary extensions capable of generating kpni, hindiii or nhei restriction sites. these deletion fragments were cleaved, gel-purified and cloned into pgl3-enhancer vector . five promoter plasmids  were verified by restriction enzyme cutting and sequencing.

cells were seeded at 5 ×  <dig> cells/well and cultured in 12-well plates for 24 h prior to transfection. the cells were transfected with 1 μg of various ngx <dig> promoter constructs, pgl3-control plasmid, or pgl3-enhancer plasmid by lipofectamine  <dig> reagent  according to manufacturer’s instructions. to control transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with  <dig>  μg sv <dig> β-galactosidase vector per well. 48 h after transfection, the cell lysates were prepared and luciferase activity was measured by luciferase assay kit . β-galactosidase activity was also quantified using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system . experiments were repeated at least three times with three replicates per sample.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
nuclear protein was prepared by using nr-per nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents . then nuclear supernatants were collected and stored at -80°c until used. protein concentration was determined using bca protein assay kit . and the following oligonucleotides and their complementary strands were synthesized and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis -purified by songan: ngx <dig>  5′-gtagggcgggggcgggctttact-3′ .

according to the manufacturer’s instructions of lightshift chemiluminescent emsa kit ,  <dig> ug nuclear protein extracts were incubated with  <dig> fmol of biotin labeled oligonucleotides for 20 min at room temperature . in competition experiments, prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotides nuclear extracts were incubated for 10 min with excess unlabeled oligonucleotides. the reaction mixtures were then resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gel in  <dig>  × tbe. then the binding reactions were transferred to nylon membrane and crosslinking was performed with a hand-held uv lamp equipped with 254 nm bulbs. finally, the biotin-dna was detected by chemiluminescence.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay
chip assays were performed by using a kit from upstate biotechnology. ht- <dig> cells were crosslinked by ‘ing 1% formaldehyde in cell culture medium for 10 min at room temperature, followed by adding glycine to end the process. the cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to yield fragments of  <dig> to 1000 bp. soluble chromatin was then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 14000 rpm at 4°c, and 1% of the supernatant was saved as input. diluted soluble chromatin fragments were precleared with protein g agarose to discard nonspecifically bound chromatin fragments, then immunoprecipitated with antibodies against sp <dig>  or egr- <dig>  overnight at 4°c. immunocomplexes were captured on the ssdna/protein g-agarose slurry, and washed sequentially with low-salt wash buffer, high-salt wash buffer and lici wash buffer, followed by two final washes with te buffer. after washing, the immunocomplexes were eluted by incubation for 15 min at 25°c with 200 μl of elution buffer, and reversed for 6 h at 65°c. the dna fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. the immunoprecipitated dna samples were analyzed by pcr using the primer pair:  5′-aaaggtacctgtgcttggggtgagaaa-3′ and  5′-aaagctagcgggacctgggtaggagtt-3′. pcr was carried out for 35 cycles by using a step cycle of 95°c for 30 sec, 55°c for 50 sec, 72°c for 1 min, and followed by 72°c for 10 min. a 259 bp product was detected from the reaction. as a negative control for pcr, water was added instead of the immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments. the pcr products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% agarose gal.

construction of pcmv-ha/egr-1
to construct wild type egr- <dig> expression vector, egr- <dig> gene cdna was amplified by pcr method using human fetal brain cdna library as template. according to the sequence of egr- <dig> gene  obtained from genebank, the following primers with ecori and xhoi restriction enzyme sites were used: egr- <dig>  5′-tttgaattcaggatggccgcggccaag-3′ and  5′-cacctcgagttagcaaatttcaattgtc-3′ . after an initial denaturation step at 94°c for 10 min, the pcr was carried out for 38 cycles at 94°c for 30 sec, 58°c for 50 sec, 72°c for 2 min, and followed by 72°c for 10 min. the pcr fragments were purified and subcloned into ecori/xhoi-digested pcmv-ha vector, then transformed into competent jm <dig> cells. positive clones were sequenced to verify the correct inserts, and then named as pcmv-ha/egr- <dig> 

sirna target to egr-1
egr- <dig> oligo small interfering rna   and a negative control sirna  were purchased from genepharma. for sirna transfection, sw <dig> cells were plated overnight in 6-well dish at a density of 1 ×  <dig> cells/per well. they were transiently transfected with  <dig> nm sirna using lipofectamine  <dig> transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer . the cell lysates were harvested 2 days after transfection. the total rna from sw <dig> cells was isolated with the rneasy mini kit . then egr- <dig> expression and ngx <dig> expression were evaluated by rt–pcr or real-time quantitative pcr.

rt-pcr and real-time quantitative pcr
total rna from harvested cells was isolated using trizol reagent  and then treated with dnasei  to eliminate possible dna contamination. rna was quantified by optical density  and stored at -80°c until used. cdna was prepared using reverse transcription system .

RESULTS
identification of ngx <dig> minimal promoter 
in order to define the minimal promoter of ngx <dig> gene, five progressive 5' ends deletion constructs were generated from the full-length promoter construct pgl <dig> -159/+ <dig> . plasmid pgl <dig> -159/+ <dig>  pgl <dig> -159/+ <dig>  pgl3 + 100/+ <dig>  pgl <dig> -159/- <dig>  pgl <dig> -86/+ <dig> and pgl3 + 12/+ <dig> were transiently transfected into cos <dig> and ht- <dig> cells, respectively. the luciferase activity driven by ngx <dig> promoter constructs was measured after transfection for 48 h. luciferase expression levels were corrected for variable transfection efficiencies by cotransfection with β-galactosidase plasmid. as shown in figure 1b, three constructs, pgl <dig> -159/+ <dig>  pgl <dig> -86/+ <dig> and pgl3 + 12/+ <dig> showed the same high luciferase expression as the full-length promoter construct pgl <dig> -159/+ <dig>  whereas luciferase expression in pgl3 + 100/+ <dig> and pgl <dig> -159/- <dig> transfected cells was extremely low as pgl3-enhancer. these results indicated that a 186-bp fragment spanning positions - <dig> to +100 bp is required for the basal transcriptional activity of the ngx <dig> promoter.

transcription factor sp <dig> and egr- <dig> bind to an overlapping sp1/egr- <dig> binding motif in the ngx <dig> minimal promoter
a region spanning - <dig> to +100 bp of ngx <dig> minimal promoter was performed with matinspector professional program. some critical putative binding sites were predicted in this region, including the binding site for sp <dig> , two nf-y binding sites  and a sp1/egr- <dig> overlapping site  . to identify the binding of transcription factor to this putative overlapping binding site within ngx <dig> promoter, emsa and chip were performed. emsa assay was conducted using a biotin 5' end-labeled oligonucleotide probe spanning - <dig> to -39 bp region. as shown in figure 3a, three dna protein complexes were detected after incubate the probe with nuclear extract from ht- <dig> cells. the complex formation was fully suppressed by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type - <dig> to -39 bp oligonucleotide probe. this suppression was not observed when 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled mutated type - <dig> to -39 bp oligonucleotide probe was added as competitor. these results indicated that the sp1/egr- <dig> binding site at - <dig> to -39 bp is specific. to investigate whether transcription factor sp <dig> and egr- <dig> interacts with ngx <dig> minimal promoter through their specific binding sites in vivo, chip assay was performed. as shown in figure 3b, with the dna samples immunoprecipitated in ht- <dig> cells by rabbit polyclonal antibodies against sp <dig> and egr- <dig> respectively as templates, a 259 bp dna fragment of ngx <dig> promoter could be amplified. these results further showed that transcription factor sp <dig> and egr- <dig> specifically bind to ngx <dig> minimal promoter.

role of the transcription factor egr- <dig> in the regulation of ngx <dig> promoter activity
in order to detect the effects of transcriptional factor egr- <dig> on the promoter activity of ngx <dig> gene, we constructed plasmid pcmv-ha/egr- <dig>  the plasmid was confirmed by enzyme cutting  and sequencing . sw <dig> cells were transfected with  <dig>  μg ngx <dig> promoter constructs pgl <dig> -86/+ <dig>   <dig>  μg sv <dig> β-galactosidase vector and various amount of pcmv-ha/egr- <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  overexpression of egr- <dig> increased the promoter activity of pgl3-86/+ <dig> in sw <dig> cells. similar results were observed in ht- <dig> and sw <dig> cells . these results indicated that transcription factor egr- <dig> is a positive regulatory element for ngx <dig> gene.

requirement of egr- <dig> for induction of ngx <dig> expression
to investigate whether egr- <dig> was required for induction of ngx <dig> gene expression, pcmv-ha/egr- <dig> was transiently transfected into sw <dig> cells, and pcmv-ha was used as a negative control. 48 h after transfection, mrna was isolated from the cells. ngx <dig> mrna expression was detected by rt-pcr  and real-time quantitative pcr . these results indicated that compared to overexpression of the control vector pcma-ha, ngx <dig> mrna level was increased when egr- <dig> was overexpressed in sw <dig> cells.to investigate the role of endogenous egr- <dig> in regulation of ngx <dig> expression, sirna technology which small dna inserts encoding short hairpin rna against egr- <dig> expression was used. sw <dig> cells were transfected with sirna-egr- <dig> or sirna-control, respectively. 48 h after transfection, mrna was isolated from harvested cells. rt-pcr  and real-time quantitative pcr  revealed that compared with sirna-control, transfection with sirna-egr- <dig> reduced the expression levels ngx <dig> mrna. taken together, these results indicated that egr- <dig> is required for ngx <dig> mrna expression.

discussion
ngx <dig> , a novel candidate metastasis suppressor gene, was cloned by a location candidate cloning strategy. its function is associated with colorectal carcinoma occurrence and development. previous study has indicated that ngx <dig> was decreased or undetectable in colorectal carcinoma and involved in cellular growth, cell cycle progression and tumor angiogenesis. however, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of ngx <dig> gene.

bioinformatics analysis indicated that no canonical tata boxes were found in ngx <dig> promoter, while two caat boxes, a gpg island and putative transcription binding sites for sp <dig>  egr- <dig>  nf-y etc. were discovered  <cit> . in this report, using various promoter deletion constructs, the minimal promoter of ngx <dig> gene was defined in a - <dig> to +100 bp region, which is the shortest promoter identified so far in the regulatory region of ngx <dig> gene. the results of matinspector showed that this region contained an overlapping sp1/egr- <dig> gc-rich motif for the binding of the zinc finger transcription factors egr- <dig> and sp <dig>  emsa along with chip assays confirmed a specific sp1/egr- <dig> overlapping site spanning from - <dig> to -39 bp in ngx <dig> minimal promoter. similar sp1/egr- <dig> overlapping binding sites have been shown to play a critical role in the expression of some genes, such as tf, ndrg <dig> and pdgf-a <cit> . the regulation of transcription by these two transcription factors has been shown to be complex: in some genes the two factors are synergistic, whereas in other systems the factors appear to compete  <cit> . egr- <dig> encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that binds to the gc-rich sequence 5'-gcgggggcg-3' and regulates transcription of target gene through the gc-rich consensus sequence  <cit> . egr- <dig> expression had been found to be either decreased or undetectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma  <cit> . various studies have indicated egr- <dig> is involved in regulation of cell proliferation and may have tumor suppressive functions  <cit> . in our experiment, immunohistochemical staining of egr- <dig> showed weaker staining in metastatic tissue in comparison to non-metastatic tissue in a colorectal tissue microarray.

rt-pcr and western blot also confirmed that egr- <dig> expression level in sw <dig> cells is lower than that in sw <dig> cells . therefore, we hypothesize that egr- <dig> regulate the expression of ngx <dig> gene in colorectal cancer as a tumor suppressor gene. in our study, overexpression of egr- <dig> increased the activity of ngx <dig> promoter and up-regulated the expression level of ngx <dig> mrna, whereas knock-down of egr- <dig> reduced endogenous mrna expression of ngx <dig> gene in sw <dig> cells. from these findings, we conclude that egr- <dig> is indeed a positive regulator of ngx <dig> gene. in previous study, a series of related experiment has revealed that nuclear transcription factor sp <dig> also positively regulates ngx <dig> promoter transcriptional expression  <cit> . egr- <dig> binding may influence the occupancy of sp <dig> proteins in certain environment such as hypoxia  <cit>  and result in the induction of ngx <dig> gene expression changes. further studies needs to be done to confirm this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the current study provides a molecular model for egr- <dig> in positive regulation of ngx <dig> promoter activity and mrna expression. these results will help to better understand the role of ngx <dig> gene in carcinoma progression and may provide a new potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy from the view of knockdown of egr- <dig> and down-regulation of ngx <dig> gene.
