BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses display two membrane-anchored glycoproteins, hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase . ha mediates attachment of the virus to sialic acid receptors on host cells to initiate virus infection. after virus replication, na removes sialic acid residues from viral and cellular glycoproteins to facilitate virus release and allow spread of infection to new cells. in the absence of na activity, the progeny virions aggregate and infection ends  <cit> .

the distinct antigenic properties of ha and na from different viruses are used to classify influenza type a into subtypes— <dig> for ha and  <dig> for na. h1n <dig> , h2n <dig>  and h3n <dig>  caused the major influenza pandemics of the 20th century. evidence that the new ha and sometimes na genes originated in wild birds before appearing in humans has raised concerns about the recent spread of highly pathogenic avian h5n <dig> viruses. these viruses have the potential to gain transmissibility among humans and thereby devastate immunologically naïve human populations  <cit> . type b viruses are not carried by birds and are not divided into antigenic subtypes, but since the mid-1980s, two lineages, b/victoria and b/yamagata, have been evolving concurrently in humans  <cit> .

na is a good target for structure-based enzyme inhibitor design because its well-characterized active site is conserved across all influenza a and b viruses  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acids in the active site that interact with sialic acid remain unchanged amidst extensive genetic variation in the rest of the sequence  <cit> ; for an alignment, see  <cit> . structure-based drug design led to the successful antiviral drugs zanamivir   <cit>  and oseltamivir   <cit>  that are effective against different types and subtypes of influenza. zanamivir is based on a transition state analogue of sialic acid while oseltamivir replaces sialic acid's pyranose ring with a cyclohexene scaffold . the high potency and oral activity of oseltamivir encourages the use of alternative scaffolds to replace the sugar ring of sialic acid  <cit> . benzene ring scaffolds minimize the number of chiral centers, potentially simplifying the chemical synthesis and reducing associated expenses  <cit> . the challenge is to configure substituents on the ring to optimize the interactions with the active site. the direct contacts with sialic acid are conserved in all influenza nas, but the subsites that surround the sialic acid—named according to the ring atoms of sialic acid —show differences in size and shape between strains and sometimes account for large differences in potency between n <dig>  n <dig> and b nas  <cit> . in addition, inhibitors with a hydrophobic side chain often show differences in potency between the two structural groups of type a na: group  <dig>  and group  <dig>   <cit> .

x-ray structures of several simple benzoic acid derivatives bound to influenza b na show that these inhibitors bind to the active site in the same orientation as sialic acid  <cit> . the derivatives' common carboxylate substitution at the c <dig> position maintains the native interaction with the arginine triad , and the n-acetyl substitution at the c <dig> subsite maintains the native interaction with arg <dig> 

in addition, using a benzene ring scaffold, hydrophobic groups of varying lengths fit into the glycerol binding site  of the sialic acid  <cit> . the length and branching of the aliphatic chain have been modified to improve inhibition, but benzoic acids from this structural class have yet to match the inhibitory activities observed for zanamivir and oseltamivir. it is likely that this results from the lack of a basic group  in the c <dig> subsite, which forms an important salt bridge with inhibitors in clinical use.

one of the best compounds from the existing benzoic acid series, inhibitor  <dig>   lacks the c <dig> subsite substituent yet exhibited moderately potent  activity against nas of the n <dig> and n <dig> subtypes of influenza a virus, with less inhibitory activity against influenza b virus na, as observed for other compounds with a similar hydrophobic substituent on the benzene ring  <cit> .

we are trying to broaden the specificity of the benzoic acids against influenza viruses of different subtypes and to increase potency. the best way to accomplish this goal is likely by adding a basic substituent to form a salt bridge in the c <dig> subsite. however, attempts to design substituents on the benzene ring that occupy both the negatively charged c <dig> subsite and the glycerol binding site  of sialic acid have been difficult because the two subsites are offset from the plane of the benzene ring. the results of molecular modeling studies using flexx <cit>  suggested that a different “tilt” of the benzene ring may be needed, and one way to alter the tilt may be to change the size of the hydrophobic substituent, such that an increase or a decrease in steric crowding reorients the benzene ring in the binding site.

the inhibitor studied here, compound  <dig>  like compound  <dig>  contains no chiral centers but has a longer hydrophobic substituent consisting of a 3-heptyl  group positioned one atom further from the benzene ring . enzyme inhibition assays indicate that the affinity of  <dig> is in the low micromolar range for type a nas but, compared to  <dig>  lower for type b na   <cit> . we have determined the crystal structure of  <dig> in complex with a type a n <dig> na to a resolution of  <dig>  Å, and we discuss it in terms of the successful reorientation of the benzene ring and the lack of improvement in binding affinity. the structure of the complex suggests routes to design inhibitors that might show improved affinity.

RESULTS
overall structure
n <dig> na crystals that had been soaked with inhibitor  <dig> showed similar unit cell dimensions and space group symmetry as low temperature crystal structures of other n9-inhibitor complexes and the uncomplexed mutant r292k   <cit> . the available uncomplexed native structures  were determined at room temperature and were not as suitable for direct comparison with our low temperature data, so we judged the crystal structure of the uncomplexed mutant r292k to be a less biased starting model for molecular replacement. inhibitor  <dig> bound to the active site with nearly full occupancy  and did not bind to additional sites such as the second sialic acid binding site  <cit>  .

inhibitor–n <dig> interactions
the x-ray data were of high quality and the structure of  <dig> complexed with n <dig> na was refined with  <dig>  Å x-ray data. the final model had good geometry  with all amino acid residues in the allowed region of the ramachandran plot . initial fo–fc maps showed clear electron density of the inhibitor in the active site of na . the two substituents of the inhibitor's pyrrolidine ring were buried inside the active site cavity  with no indication of alternative conformers with rotation about the c8-n bond. the fo–fc maps revealed very good electron density for the propyl group involving c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  but the other propyl group involving c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> was disordered , showing two tracks of weak electron density. we tried to refine this branch with split occupancy, but the electron density after refinement was not continuous. this result suggested that this branch adopted additional conformations and that each of the two tracks of weak electron density had much less than 50% occupancy. at this point, we decided to model this branch in one partially occupied conformation rather than all of the possible conformations.

*rmerge is high in the highest resolution shell due to the high multiplicity of the data. the rp.i.m. is independent of the data multiplicity and shows that the data in the highest shell have a reasonable discrepancy of 25%. rp.i.m.is the precision indicating rmerge <cit> .

potential interactions between inhibitor  <dig> and n <dig> na were assessed using chimera <cit> . in addition, potential hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic contacts were identified with hbplus <cit>  . favorable hydrophobic contacts were defined as non-bonded contacts between two carbon atoms at a distance of ≤4 Å  <cit> .

1potential hydrogen bonds were identified using hbplus <cit> . potential hydrogen bonds were interactions between donor and acceptor atoms that met the following geometric requirements:  a donor acceptor distance  <  <dig>  Å and a hydrogen acceptor distance  <  <dig>  Å and  a donor-acceptor-acceptor antecedent angle , of > 90°  <cit> .

2favorable hydrophobic contacts were defined as non-bonded contacts between two carbon atoms at a distance of ≤4 Å  <cit> .

3freely rotating hydroxyl hydrogen atoms had the potential to form hydrogen bonds with two alternative acceptor atoms. only the more probable acceptor atom at the shorter distance from the hydrogen atom was reported by hbplus.

4there were several conformations of the propyl chain c12-c <dig>  we used the best, but it is of low occupancy so the interactions involving c <dig> contribute very little.

structural studies of complexes between several benzoic acid leads and type b na showed that these inhibitors were bound in the active site in a similar fashion to sialic acid  <cit> , and the same is observed in the new structure . the carboxylate group of the inhibitor interacts with the guanidinium groups of arginine residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as seen in all na substrate and inhibitor complexes and calculated to be energetically important  <cit> . a weak hydrogen bond is seen between tyr <dig> and the carbonyl oxygen that interacts with arg <dig>  the pyrrolidine ring interacts with arg <dig> by forming a hydrogen bond with its carbonyl oxygen . the methylene group c <dig> lies in the hydrophobic pocket formed by trp <dig> and arg <dig>  the methylene group c <dig> is involved in c-h…o bonds with trp <dig> carbonyl o and glu <dig> oe <dig>  one of the hydroxyl methyl groups  is hydrogen bonded to glu <dig>  atom o <dig> also interacts with glu <dig> through two water molecules, hoh <dig> and hoh <dig>  by a chain of hydrogen bonds. the other hydroxyl methyl group  was directed toward trp <dig> o and glu <dig> oe <dig>  the one well-ordered propyl chain is anchored by hydrophobic contacts with ile <dig>  ala <dig>  and arg <dig>  the other propyl chain that is disordered is exposed to the solvent and therefore not contributing to binding energy because the one interaction seen  is of low occupancy and at the upper limit of the distances considered as significant.

comparative analysis
the model of  <dig> complexed with n <dig> na was compared to sialic acid complexes with a/tokyo/3/1967 n <dig> na, pdb id: 2bat  <cit>  and a/tern/australia/g70c/75 n <dig> na, pdb id: 1mwe  <cit> . when our new structure was fitted with ccp4's superpose <cit>  using the  <dig> active site residues, the root mean square deviations  were  <dig>  Å to n <dig> and  <dig>  Å to n <dig>  the model gave a rmsd of  <dig>  Å when superposed on the complex of compound  <dig> with b/lee/ <dig> na  <cit>  using coot secondary structure matching  <cit> . these small rmsds suggest that replacing the sialic acid ligand with the inhibitor did not disturb the orientation of the active site residues of na. the larger deviation between n <dig> and b nas was expected given that there is less than 30% sequence identity. in all the above comparisons, most of the active site residues  superposed well in the two molecules and a maximum shift of  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å was observed. however, the side chain of glu <dig> showed significant conformational change in the current complex when compared to na-sialic acid or na-zanamivir complexes. the two oxygen atoms oe <dig> and oe <dig> of glu <dig> in the current complex moved toward the solvent and away from the active site by 1 Å. in this position, the carboxyl group interacted with ne of arg <dig> and nh <dig> of his <dig>  hence, glu <dig> did not form the direct hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor hydroxyl oxygen o <dig> analogous to those that glu <dig> formed with the glycerol side chain of sialic acid and its transition state mimics. however, o <dig> of the inhibitor was linked to glu <dig> through the water molecules hoh <dig> and hoh <dig>  the c <dig> atom of the inhibitor is seen to make a hydrophobic contact with glu <dig> but the low occupancy of the c12-c <dig> chain precludes a significant contribution to binding.

in the compound  <dig> complex with influenza b na  <cit> , the aliphatic chain forms van der waals contacts with the side chains of arg <dig>  asn <dig> and glu <dig> while the hydroxymethyl groups interact with glu <dig>  trp <dig> and glu <dig>  the rotation of the glu <dig> side chain towards arg <dig> observed in our complex was noted in the other structures where the inhibitor carries a hydrophobic side chain  <cit> . n <dig> nas have additional flexibility compared to n <dig> in the  <dig> loop but binding of oseltamivir to wild-type n <dig> na involves a conformational change in the side chain of glu <dig> relative to the ligand free enzyme  <cit>  similar to that seen in n <dig> nas.

we compared the na and inhibitor contacts with previously reported benzoic acid inhibitor-na structures using chimera with the relatively stringent constraint of distance ≤ <dig>  Å and including both polar and hydrophobic contacts. in the bana 113-b na complex  <cit>  <cit> ,  <dig> drug atom made  <dig> contacts ≤ <dig>  Å with  <dig> amino acids of na. in 1-b na  <cit> ,  <dig> drug atoms make  <dig> contacts with  <dig> amino acids. inhibitor  <dig> shows a small increase to  <dig> drug atoms making  <dig> contacts with  <dig> amino acids. the benzene ring of  <dig> is tilted by  <dig> ° relative to compound  <dig> , increasing the number of contacts as was predicted in the design. however, one branch of the 3-heptyl group makes no significant contacts due to multiple conformations, which may be why the ic <dig> is no better than the previous compounds .

inhibitor  <dig> did not bind to the second sialic acid binding site observed in the structure of n <dig> complexed with sialic acid at low temperature  <cit>   or at room temperature .

glycan structures
when compared to the structure of the n <dig> mutant r292k  and the  <dig>  Å resolution structures of native n <dig> in complex with other inhibitors , our structure has four additional sugar units in the glycan chains attached to the delta nitrogen atoms of asn <dig> and asn <dig>  . at site  <dig>  we found a second nag residue and evidence for a β-d-mannose . at site  <dig>  we found two additional mannose residues. one mannose  is bonded to the o <dig> oxygen of man475g. the second mannose  is linked to the o <dig> oxygen atom of man475g, resulting in a glcnac2-man <dig> structure . this glycan attached to asn <dig> contacts  <dig> amino acids of the neighboring subunit when the tetramer is built by symmetry . a high-mannose glycan at asn <dig> is also present in n <dig>  na, where it interacts with the adjacent symmetry-related subunit at amino acids 391– <dig> and 453– <dig> . this glycan forms part of the mem <dig> monoclonal antibody epitope on the 1998 n <dig> na, and its interactions with the adjacent subunit are not disturbed by the presence of the antibody  <cit> , suggesting the subunit interactions are energetically significant. in n <dig> there is experimental evidence that the glycan attached to asn <dig> contributes to folding or oligomerization because the mutation n200l in n <dig> na resulted in 80% reduction in enzyme activity although the expression level was the same as wild type  <cit> . in both n <dig> and n <dig> this subunit-spanning glycan is of the high mannose type, as is the glycan at  <dig> in n <dig>  <cit> . n <dig> na  crystallized with the tetramer as the asymmetric unit, so there is direct evidence for the inter-subunit interaction of the glycan attached to asn <dig> in n <dig> na. n <dig> nas do not have a predicted glycosylation site at  <dig>  but a study of n <dig> na assembly suggested that tetramerization requires high-mannose glycans. when all the glycans were processed to complex structures then the resulting dimers and monomers did not assemble into tetramers  <cit> . the pdb structures of n <dig> na have no density for sugar residues, so it is not known if one of the other glycans is a high-mannose structure that spans the subunit interface in the same way as the glycan at asn <dig> in n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> 

glucose molecules
we used 49%  glucose as cryoprotectant, and we observed four glucose molecules bound with greater than 50% occupancy in the structure of the inhibitor complex . the glucose molecules are in a mix of alpha and beta configurations about the anomeric carbon atom. the o <dig> oxygen atom of glc <dig> interacts with the nd <dig> nitrogen atom of arg <dig> through a hydrogen bond. o <dig> and o <dig> of glc <dig> forms hydrogen bonds with ne <dig> of gln <dig> and nd <dig> of asn <dig> respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
our aim in designing inhibitor  <dig> was to extend the substituent at c <dig>  corresponding to c <dig> of sialic acid, to  increase the contact surface in the c6-subsite and  force the benzene ring to tilt to maximize these interactions while retaining the interactions of the carboxylate and the pyrolidinone substituents. the crystal structure at  <dig>  Å shows that we were partially successful in that the ring in  <dig> is tilted relative to compound  <dig>  and the overall number of contacts is increased. the ic <dig> did not decrease, and the reason became clear when we solved the crystal structure. the second propyl group is not making any contacts but is freely waving above the surface of the na. future design efforts will include unequal branches that may be accommodated in the c6-subsite.

the n <dig> na that was crystallized for this experiment was purified from virus grown in embryonated chicken eggs, so it contains a full complement of vertebrate processed n-linked glycans, in contrast to na expressed in insect cells which has truncated glycan structures. we therefore refined the glycans as far as we could see electron density. most glycans are flexible and only the first few sugars are seen, but the glycan attached to asn <dig> is well resolved due to interaction with the adjacent subunit and is seen to contain glcnac2man <dig>  mutation data suggests this glycan plays a role in stabilizing the na tetramer, which is a significant property because, for reasons that are not understood  <cit> , only the na tetramer has enzymatic activity.

the reassortant virus a/nws/33h-a/tern/australia/g70c/75n  was grown and purified as previously described  <cit> . the purified virus was digested with pronase  at a concentration of 6 mg/ml at 37 c for  <dig> hours. the cores were removed by centrifugation, and the released heads were pooled, concentrated, and purified by gel filtration using fplc  <cit> . the purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml. single crystals of n <dig> na were grown by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method containing equal volumes of n <dig> and the reservoir solution of  <dig>  m potassium phosphate buffer ph  <dig>   <cit> .

inhibitor soaking, cryoprotection and x-ray data collection
the successful flash cooling of large  cubic crystals in liquid nitrogen required serial equilibration by vapor diffusion. the estimated osmolality for  <dig>  m k-phosphate buffer  in the reservoir solution was matched to that of glucose using standard tables  <cit> . crystals were placed over wells with 200 mm k-phosphate buffer  containing 45 g/100 ml  glucose for  <dig> hours to two days and then placed over a well with 46% glucose. this procedure was repeated until the crystals were over wells that contained 49% glucose. after the final equilibration, the crystals were soaked in 49% glucose and 200 mm k-phosphate with 25 mm inhibitor for  <dig> minutes before they were mounted in a rayon cryoloop and vitrified at 100 k in a nitrogen cold-stream.

x-ray data were collected at 100 k at ssrl beam line 7– <dig> on an adsc quantum  <dig> ccd detector using monochromatic radiation with a wavelength of  <dig>  Å. the x-ray data were collected at distances of  <dig> and 220 mm with oscillation angles of  <dig> ° and  <dig> ° respectively and with 2 s exposures at both distances.

the x-ray data were indexed and integrated with xds <cit> . the integrated intensities were scaled and merged with the ccp <dig> <cit>  program scala <cit>  and converted to structure factors with truncate <cit> .
