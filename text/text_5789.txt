BACKGROUND
knock-in mice carrying functional gene cassettes have provided invaluable opportunities for in vivo functional analysis of genes and cells in mammalian organisms  <cit> . despite the recent rapid displacement of conventional gene-targeting technology in embryonic stem cells  <cit>  by crispr/cas-mediated genome editing  in mouse zygotes , the cumbersome task of targeting vector construction containing a gene cassette flanked by long homology arms  corresponding to every target loci remains unchanged  <cit> . this limits the feasibility of crispr/cas-mediated, large-scale, high-throughput generation  <cit>  of knock-in mice carrying functional gene cassettes and limits the convenience and availability of the crispr/cas system for mammalian organisms  <cit> .

the homologous recombination -mediated repair of dna double-strand breaks  induced by crispr/cas has been used to knock-in the gene cassettes in endogenous target genomic loci in mouse zygotes  <cit> . however, the dsbs are primarily repaired through nonhomologous end joining  in mammalian cells, and thus the frequency of hr-mediated repair is intrinsically low  <cit> . the efficiencies of hr-mediated gene cassette knock-in in mice are around 10–20%, much less than that  of nhej-mediated gene knockout  <cit> . we recently reported the cloning-free crispr/cas system, which is based on the cas <dig> protein and chemically synthesized dual-rnas  instead of broadly used single-guide rna , facilitates hr-mediated gene cassette knock-in in mice by up to 50%  <cit> . the technological development of crispr/cas-mediated gene cassette knock-in in mice is just beginning, and much improvement is required.

a major alternative pathway for dsb repair, named microhomology-mediated end joining , joins the ends of dsbs by utilizing microhomology for the alignment of broken ends, leading to deletions at the site of the dsbs  <cit> . interestingly, the microhomologies were frequently found in the majority of repaired sites of the dsbs induced by crispr/cas in mice  <cit>  and human cells . taking advantage of the high frequency of mmej, we recently developed the highly efficient and convenient crispr/cas or transcription activator-like effector nuclease -based precise integration into the target chromosome  system that harnesses mmej to knock-in a gene cassette into target genomic loci with extremely short  microhomologies in cultured cells , silkworms  <cit> , frogs  <cit> , and zebrafish  <cit> . in addition to its high efficiency, the pitch system has the potential to omit the laborious steps of constructing a targeting vector for gene cassette knock-in by the use of microhomologies. the pitch system may be a key technology for feasible, large-scale, knock-in projects  <cit>  to generate thousands of mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein  or cre recombinase under the control of an endogenous promoter, similar to the gene expression nervous system atlas  project for bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice  <cit> ; however, its validity in mammalian organisms has not been examined. here, we show the efficient and highly convenient pitch-based knock-in strategy in mice by the combination of an mmej-directed simplified donor vector, overexpression of the mmej-enhancing factor, and the cloning-free crispr/cas system.

RESULTS
generation of knock-in mice carrying a gene cassette by the pitch system
to test the pitch system in mouse zygotes, we chose the actb locus  <cit>  where we previously knocked-in a  <dig> -kb gene cassette by the cloning-free crispr/cas system with a conventional targeting vector containing 2-kb homology arms  <cit> . in the present study, we knocked-in a 5-kb teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry gene cassette /mcherry flanked by two pairs of loxp and loxp <dig> ) to the actb locus   <cit> . since linearization of the donor is required for gene cassette knock-in by the pitch system, we designed a synthetic guide rna sequence  as the universal guide rna that shares no sequence homology with the genomic dna of several mammalian species, including human and mouse  <cit> . we constructed pitch-directed donor vectors   <cit>  containing a 5-kb teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry cassette flanked by 40-bp left and right microhomologies corresponding to 800 bp downstream of the actb polya signal and grna-s <dig> crrna target sequences . the pitch donor was efficiently digested by in vitro digestion assay  with grna-s <dig> crrna, tracrrna, and cas <dig> protein .fig.  <dig> generation of knock-in mice carrying a gene cassette by the pitch system. a targeting strategy for the generation of actb-teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry knock-in mice by the pitch system. purple highlights indicate microhomologies between endogenous actb locus and pitch-donor. blue characters indicate crispr target sequences. red characters indicate protospacer adjacent motif  sequences. yellow lightnings indicate dsb sites. b schematic diagram of pronuclear injection of cas <dig> protein, actb and grna-s <dig> crrnas, tracrrna and pitch-donor. the red, purple, and blue boxes indicate the insert, actb microhomologies, and grna-s <dig> target sequences, respectively. c pcr screenings of knock-in newborns. d summary of actb-teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry knock-in mouse production by the pitch system. e sequences of boundaries between actb and teto-flex- hm3dq/mcherry cassette. blue characters indicate microhomologies. if: internal forward primer, ir: internal reverse primer, lf: left forward primer, lr: left reverse primer, rf: right forward primer, rr: right reverse primer, mh: microhomology, m: molecular marker, wt: wildtype, ki: knock-in, wpre: woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element, pa: polya, and ki/+: tail genomic dna of f <dig> heterozygous knock-in pup derived from # <dig>  f <dig> knock-in mouse




we then injected the circular pitch donor together with chemically synthesized actb and grna-s <dig> crrnas and tracrrna, and cas <dig> protein into one-cell-stage mouse zygotes   <cit> . we obtained  <dig> newborns, and screened their tail genomic dna by pcr with three different primer sets  to identify knock-in mice . we found three knock-in mice defined by triple pcr positive carrying a teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry cassette at the actb locus . knock-in efficiency was 12% . we also found two partial knock-in mice defined by double pcr positive for lf + lr and if + ir carrying a part of the cassette at the actb locus . next, we sequenced the pcr products of the left and right boundaries between actb and the teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry cassette and found the precise knock-in of the cassette we designed . although left boundaries were precisely knocked-in in two partial knock-in mice, we could not determine their right boundaries . we also sequenced the pcr products of non-knock-in actb alleles amplified with lf and rr primers. these alleles were modified by nhej in 92% of the newborn mice . collectively, the knock-in mice carrying a gene cassette could be generated by the pitch system in combination with cloning-free crispr/cas system. however, its efficiency  was much lower than that of our previous study , which was accomplished by the combination of a conventional targeting vector with long homology arms and the cloning-free crispr/cas system, although the length of knock-in cassette in this study was larger than that of previous report .

genetic screening of mmej enhancer
to enhance the efficiency of the mmej-mediated gene cassette knock-in, we conducted genetic screening to identify genes that enhance mmej. we constructed a fluorescent reporter system to detect mmej-mediated repair of dsbs, similar to the previous report  <cit> . the reporter plasmid expressing inactive  egfp was split by a crispr target sequence containing two tandem microhomologies under the control of the cmv promoter . when the dsbs in the reporter plasmid induced by crispr are repaired through mmej between two microhomologies, functional in-frame egfp is reconstituted and egfp fluorescence is recovered . we chose  <dig> candidate genes from among those involved in dsb repair pathways  polymerase  <dig> , nijmegen breakage syndrome protein  <dig> , flap structure-specific endonuclease  <dig> , bloom syndrome recq like helicase , meiotic recombination 11a , rad <dig>  rad <dig>  three prime repair exonuclease  <dig> , dominant-negative dna ligase  <dig> , and dominant-negative ku <dig> ) and introduced plasmids expressing these cdnas together with three plasmids; the mmej-monitoring reporter, crispr/cas vector targeting the reporter, and mcherry-expressing vector  into hek293t cells. of these, we found overexpression of mmej-related genes and dominant-negative mutants increased the number of egfp-positive cells . especially, mmej efficiency by exo <dig> overexpression increased more than  <dig> -fold compared to that of the mock overexpression quantified by imaging analysis . the overexpression of trex <dig>  rad <dig>  or rad <dig> did not increase the number of egfp-positive cells. conversely, significant reduction of egfp-positive cells was observed with rad <dig> overexpression compared to that of mock overexpression, consistent with the involvement of this gene in the dsb repair pathway through homologous recombination  <cit> . these results suggest that overexpression of mmej factors, including exo <dig>  and dominant-negative nhej factors specifically enhanced mmej for dsb repair in human cells. among these, we focused on exo <dig> in this study, because exo <dig> was reported to increase the mutation frequency of talen in mammalian cells and zygotes by potentially acting as an mmej enhancer  <cit> .fig.  <dig> screening of mmej-enhancing factors using a fluorescence reporter assay. a schematic diagram of mmej-dependent egfp recovery. green letters indicate chromophore sequence. black line indicates crispr target sequence. black box indicates protospacer adjacent motif  sequence. black triangles indicate dsb site. mh, microhomology. cmv, cytomegalovirus promoter. b schematic diagram of hek293t-based reporter assay, followed by imaging analysis. c fluorescence microscopy images of transfected cells. bars, 500 μm. d relative frequencies of mmej repair, fold to mock overexpression. the mmej frequencies were calculated by imaging analysis. data are expressed as means ± sem 




exo <dig> enhances pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in in human cells
next, we tested whether exo <dig> enhances the efficiency of pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in in an endogenous target locus in human cells. we constructed the pitch-donor targeting human fibrillarin  gene, a component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, containing a  <dig> -kb mneongreen-2a-puromycin cassette  <cit> , although puromycin selection was not used in this study. this cassette was flanked by 40-bp left and right microhomologies corresponding to the last coding exon of the fbl and grna-s <dig> crrna target sequences -fbl) . the in-frame c-terminal fusion of fbl with the cassette produces the mneongreen fluorescence in the nucleolar. we introduced the pitch-fbl donor and the all-in-one crispr/cas plasmid  <cit>  expressing two sgrnas targeting endogenous fbl  <cit>  and grna-s <dig>  and the cas <dig> protein, together with plasmids expressing exo <dig> or mre11a cdnas in hek293t cells . fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analysis revealed the knock-in efficiency of the mneongreen cassette to the endogenous fbl locus with exo <dig> overexpression increased 30% compared to that with mock or mre11a overexpression without drug selection . the knock-in-enhancing effect of exo <dig> was also confirmed by imaging analysis using laser-scanning microscopy . for imaging analysis, mcherry-expressing vectors were co-transfected with the above-described vectors, and the areas of mneongreen- and mcherry-positive cells were calculated . consistent with the results of the facs analysis, exo <dig> increased the percentages of mneongreen-positive cells in mcherry-positive cells by 50% . a magnified view of the lsm images confirmed nucleolar localization of the green fluorescence foci, suggesting that the mneongreen-positive cells could be considered as the correctly knocked-in cells . we further confirmed correct gene knock-in in exo1-overexpressed cells by dna sequencing of 5’ and 3’ junctions . correct knock-in junctions without any mutations were frequently found at both 5’ and 3’ junctions, and their frequencies are comparable with those using a donor with 20-bp microhomology without exo <dig> overexpression reported previously  <cit>  . in addition, we performed western blotting and toxicity analysis to confirm the effectiveness and safeness of exo <dig> overexpression. the results suggested that protein level of exo <dig> was increased by overexpression and it did not affect cell viability .fig.  <dig> enhancement of mmej-mediated gene knock-in by exo <dig> overexpression at the fbl locus in hek293t cells. a schematic diagram of gene knock-in strategy at the fbl locus in hek293t cells. black lines indicate crispr target sequences. black boxes indicate pam sequences. black triangles indicate dsb sites. mh, microhomology. puro, puromycin resistance gene. b schematic diagram of gene knock-in in hek293t cells, followed by facs analysis. c relative frequencies of gene knock-in, fold to mock overexpression. the knock-in frequencies were calculated by facs analysis . data are expressed as means ± sem . statistical significance was determined by student’s t-test. *p <  <dig> . d the percentages of mneongreen-positive cell areas in mcherry-positive cell areas, calculated by imaging analysis . data are expressed as means ± sem . statistical significance was determined by student’s t-test. *p <  <dig> . e confocal laser scanning microscopy images of transfected cells. the knocked-in cells showed nucleolar localization of mneongreen fluorescence. bars, 30 μm. f dna sequencing analysis of bacterially cloned pcr products of 5’ and 3’ junctions amplified from the cells knocked-in with exo <dig>  the intended knocked-in sequence is shown at the top of each set of sequences. blue letters indicate the microhomologies. red letters indicate insertions




to confirm the knock-in-enhancing effect of exo <dig>  we knocked-in the same gene cassette at another gene locus in another cell line. we aimed to target human actb  gene in hela cells . the knock-in efficiency with exo <dig> overexpression slightly increased compared to that without exo <dig> . lsm observation revealed that fluorescent cells showed cytoplasmic localization and peripheral accumulation . the correct knock-in was also confirmed by dna sequencing analysis . without exo <dig> overexpression, the percentages of precise knock-in were  <dig>  and  <dig> % at the 5’ and 3’ junctions, respectively . with exo <dig> overexpression, the percentages of precise knock-in were  <dig>  and 100% at the 5’ and 3’ junctions, respectively . from these direct comparison analysis, it was suggested that exo <dig> overexpression might result in not only higher efficiency but also higher accuracy.fig.  <dig> mmej-mediated gene knock-in at the hactb locus in hela cells. a schematic diagram of gene knock-in strategy at the hactb locus in hela cells. black lines indicate crispr target sequences. black boxes indicate pam sequences. black triangles indicate dsb sites. mh, microhomology. puro, puromycin resistance gene. b relative frequencies of gene knock-in, fold to mock overexpression. the knock-in frequencies were calculated by facs analysis, similar to fig. 3b, except that mcherry was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. data are expressed as means ± sem . statistical significance was determined by student’s t-test. *p <  <dig> . c confocal laser scanning microscopy images of transfected cells. the knocked-in cells showed cytoplasmic localization and peripheral accumulation of mneongreen fluorescence. bars, 30 μm. d, e dna sequencing analysis of bacterially cloned pcr products of 5’ and 3’ junctions amplified from the cells knocked-in without exo <dig>  and with exo <dig> . the intended knocked-in sequence is shown at the top of each set of sequences. blue bars indicate the microhomologies. red letters indicate mutated bases including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. blue letters indicate polymorphisms found on the off-target genomic sites, related to fig. 5a. roman numbers shown at the left side of each set of sequences indicate the allele types, related to fig. 5a and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  s <dig> and table s <dig>  statistical significance was determined by chi-square test. *p <  <dig> . ** p <  <dig> 




it has been well known that functional hactb protein is produced from a single gene; however, there are many pseudogenes in the human genome  <cit> . the in silico prediction of the cleavage sites of sgrna designed to knock-in in hactb locus revealed that there were a lot of candidate sites in the human genome . we thus aligned the upstream and downstream regions of genomic dsb site of the on-target and  <dig> off-target sites listed according to the scores calculated by the cosmid webtool  <cit>  . compared with the results of sequencing analysis, we found that some base replacements found in the sequenced alleles seemed to be derived from off-target integrants . more interestingly, mismatched bases near the dsb site were replaced with the donor sequence, whereas those far from the dsb site were not replaced, suggesting that possible window of base replacement via mmej repair was determined as around 15 bp each, when the lengths of microhomologies were set as 40 bp . collectively, these results suggest that exo <dig> enhances the efficiency, and specificity when targeted multiple genomic sites, of the pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in in the endogenous target loci in human cells.fig.  <dig> potential window of mmej-dependent base replacement revealed by sequence alignment of on- and off-target knock-ins. a sequence alignment of upstream and downstream regions of the dsb site. ot1–ot <dig> represents off-target sites, related to additional file 1: table s <dig>  roman numbers shown at the right side of each set of sequences indicate the allele types, related to fig. 4d, e and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  s <dig> and table s <dig>  black triangles indicate the dsb site. black boxes indicate the crispr target sequence. red and blue underlines indicate the left and right microhomologies, respectively. black underlines indicate mutated sequences found in sequenced knock-in junctions. blue letters indicate the polymorphisms found in sequenced knock-in junctions, related to fig. 4d, e. red letters indicate the mutations not found in the sequenced knock-in junctions. asterisks indicate positions with complete base conservation among on- and off-target sites. the positions of bases replaced and not replaced with the donor sequence were masked in red and blue, respectively. the upstream sequences of ot <dig>  ot <dig>  ot <dig>  ot <dig>  ot <dig>  and ot <dig> and the downstream sequences of ot <dig>  ot <dig>  and ot <dig> were identical, respectively . b schematic representation of potential mmej window. red and blue boxes indicate the left and right microhomologies, respectively




pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in in mice with exo1
we further tested whether exo <dig> enhances the efficiency of pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in in the endogenous target locus in mouse zygotes. we injected the circular pitch donor with chemically synthesized actb and grna-s <dig> crrna and tracrrna and the cas <dig> protein with in vitro-transcribed human exo <dig> mrna into one-cell stage mouse zygotes . we obtained  <dig> newborn mice, of these, five were identified as triple pcr positive knock-in mice carrying a teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry cassette at the actb locus . we also found one partial knock-in mouse defined by double pcr positive for lf + lr and if + ir carrying a part of the cassette at the actb locus . next, we sequenced the pcr products of the left and right boundaries between actb and the teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry cassette. we found the precise knock-in of the cassette at both boundaries in four out of five knock-in mice . in eki# <dig>  although the 3’ boundary was precisely knocked-in as we had designed, we found a residual partial sequence of grna-s <dig> adjacent to the 5’ microhomology of the gene cassette  and a 57-bp deletion of the endogenous locus, which did not affect endogenous actb or exogenous cassette functions . although left boundary was precisely knocked-in in one partial knock-in mouse, we could not determine its right boundary . the non-knock-in actb alleles were modified by nhej in all the newborn mice . taken together, the knock-in efficiency of the gene cassette by the combination of exo <dig>  pitch-donor, and cloning-free crispr/cas was  <dig> %, with or without functionally negligible mutations . these results revealed that increasing tendency of pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in by exo <dig> in the endogenous target locus in mouse zygotes.fig.  <dig> generation of gene cassette knock-in mice by the enhanced pitch system. a schematic diagram of pronuclear injection of cas <dig> protein, actb and grna-s <dig> crrnas, tracrrna, pitch-donor, and exo <dig> mrna. b pcr screenings of knock-in newborns. c summary of actb-teto-flex-hm3dq/mcherry knock-in mouse production by the enhanced pitch system. d sequences of boundaries between actb and teto-flex- hm3dq/mcherry cassette. blue and red characters indicate microhomologies and partial crrna target sequence, respectively. if: internal forward primer, ir: internal reverse primer, lf: left forward primer, lr: left reverse primer, rf: right forward primer, rr: right reverse primer, mh: microhomology, m: molecular marker, wt: wildtype, ki: knock-in, and ki/+: tail genomic dna of f <dig> heterozygous knock-in pup derived from # <dig>  f <dig> knock-in mouse




we further tested off-target cleavage in the knock-in mice generated by the cloning-free crispr/cas system-based pitch system. we chose five off-target candidate loci containing up to 3 bp mismatches compared to the 20-bp guide sequence of actb crrna  <cit> . among five off-target candidate loci in three knock-in mice without exo <dig> overexpression and five knock-in mice with exo <dig> overexpression, we did not find any off-target digestion . these results suggest that pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in in mouse zygotes by the cloning-free crispr/cas system is highly specific to the on-target locus, and its specificity is not affected by exo <dig> overexpression.

subsequently, we crossed f <dig> knock-in mice with a wild-type mouse to investigate germline transmission of the knock-in alleles to the f <dig> generation. we tested seven knock-in mice, and found successful germline transmission of the knock-in allele in f <dig> progeny . the efficiencies of germline transmission were 50% or higher in five out of seven f <dig> knock-in mice, suggesting that these f <dig> mice were heterozygous knock-in mice. in contrast, two  showed  <dig> % efficiencies of germline transmission. these results suggest that germline mosaicism was occurred in some knock-in mice; however, its frequency was low.

compared to the newborn rates of our previous work using conventional targeting vector , it was low in pitch system . we hypothesized that linearization of circular pitch donor may partially explain this. we injected the pcr-amplified linear pitch donor without vector backbone together with chemically synthesized actb and grna-s <dig> crrnas and tracrrna, and cas <dig> protein into one-cell-stage mouse zygotes in the absence of exo <dig> , and obtained only one newborn from the transfer of  <dig> embryos . next, we injected pcr-amplified linear pitch donor at reduced doses, actb crrna, tracrrna, and cas <dig> protein . we obtained one newborn from the transfer of  <dig> embryos with 5 ng/μl linear pitch donor . when we further reduced the dose of linear pitch donor with  <dig>  ng/μl, the newborn rate was improved to  <dig> %  . these results suggest that linear donor dna itself is detrimental to the embryo development, rather than exo <dig>  and the birth rate can be improved in the donor dna dose dependent manner.

we finally tested whether modified injection protocol with reduced donor dna concentration could produce knock-in mice by enhanced pitch system. we chose the col12a <dig> gene and designed a pitch donor to knock-in the floxed allele for exon  <dig> substitution as well as a pair of crrna targeting the flanking introns to excise the target exon  because global col12a1-knockout mice showed severe skeletal abnormalities and perinatal lethality  <cit> . we injected the reduced amount of circular pitch donor  together with chemically synthesized col12a <dig> and grna-s <dig> crrnas, tracrrna, exo <dig> mrna, and cas <dig> protein into one-cell-stage mouse zygotes . we screened nine newborns by hindiii digestion of genomic pcr products and sequencing, and identified three as knock-in mice carrying floxed alleles . further, we cloned and sequenced the pcr products, and found the precise knock-in of a hindiii site and two loxp sites on the same alleles in all three knock-in mice as we designed . the precise integration of two loxp sites on the same allele was also confirmed by excision of the allele by cre recombinase , although col12a <dig> protein level was not investigated. the knock-in efficiency of floxed col12a <dig> was  <dig> %  comparable to that of actb by enhanced pitch system . collectively, the modified injection protocol is enough to produce the knock-in mice carrying a floxed allele by enhanced pitch system with sufficient efficiency.fig.  <dig> generation of floxed mice by the enhanced pitch system. a targeting strategy for the generation of floxcol12a <dig> mice by the enhanced pitch system. purple highlights indicate microhomologies between endogenous col12a <dig> locus and pitch-donor. blue characters indicate crispr target sequences. red characters indicate protospacer adjacent motif  sequences. yellow lightnings indicate dsb sites. b schematic diagram of pronuclear injection of cas <dig> protein, col12a1-left, -right, and grna-s <dig> crrnas, tracrrna, pitch-donor, and exo <dig> mrna. the red, purple, and blue boxes indicate the insert, col12a <dig> microhomologies, and grna-s <dig> target sequences, respectively. c pcr screenings of newborns. d pcr-rflp  screenings of floxed newborn mice. e summary of floxcol12a <dig> mouse production by the enhanced pitch system. f sequences of boundaries between col12a <dig> and loxps. blue, green, and red characters indicate microhomologies, hindiii sites, and loxps, respectively. g in vitro cre-recombination assay. cloned pcr products of flox alleles from three floxcol12a <dig> mice and genomic pcr of wildtype were incubated with or without cre-recombinase. lf: left forward primer, rr: right reverse primer, mh: microhomology, m: molecular marker, and wt: wildtype




discussion
although we previously developed an improved crispr/cas system for hr-mediated gene cassette knock-in in mice by using chemically synthesized dual-rnas and commercially available cas <dig> protein  <cit> , constructing targeting vectors containing long homology arms corresponding to every target locus has remained cumbersome and fundamentally unchanged for 30 years  <cit> . in this report, we applied the pitch system for the generation of knock-in mice, and this resulted in the omission of the laborious steps of constructing targeting vectors. our new method has major advantages for researchers generating gene cassette knock-in mice.

first, our method enables extremely convenient and high-throughput donor vector production. because the mmej-directed donor vector can easily be prepared by a single pcr and ta-cloning using primers conjugated with 40-bp microhomology and grna-s <dig> crrna target sequence from any template plasmid containing various gene cassettes   <cit> , the long homology arms, which have to be amplified from genomic dna, are no longer required. thus, for example, nearly  <dig> mmej-directed donor vectors corresponding to nearly  <dig> target loci can be prepared by a single pcr reaction in a 96-well plate and those ta-cloning, enabling a large-scale, high-throughput, knock-in mouse project  <cit> . by combining the enhanced pitch system with the cloning-free crispr/cas system, critical steps are to design primers to pcr amplify various gene cassettes for 40-bp microhomology arms and their subsequent cloning. thus, our new method provides a novel approach to a knock-in gene cassette in mice on scales of both a small laboratory and a large international consortium.

second, the enhanced pitch system enabled gene cassette knock-in mouse generation. we successfully generated knock-in mice carrying a 5-kb gene cassette by the original pitch system  <cit>  in combination with the cloning-free crispr/cas system with about 10% efficiency. its efficiency was acceptable and comparable to previous reports using an hr-based conventional targeting vector with long homology arms  <cit> . we performed genetic screening to identify an mmej enhancer and found that the co-delivery of exo <dig> enhanced knock-in efficiency in human cells. we showed that the knock-in efficiency of a 5-kb gene cassette in mice was 30% by the combination of exo <dig>  the pitch system, and the cloning-free crispr/cas system. we further showed the validity of the enhanced pitch system in mice in another genomic locus by knocking in floxed alleles. these efficiencies are sufficient for conventional use, and thus, several knock-in newborn mice can be obtained from small-scale embryonic manipulation, leading to flexible, high-throughput and high-variety, low-volume mouse genetics.

despite the use of short microhomology  in the pitch system, the junctions between the endogenous locus and the insert were precisely integrated in the majority of the knock-in mice . we also found a short deletion of the endogenous locus at the 5’ junction in one knock-in mouse treated with exo <dig>  suggesting nhej-mediated repair occurred between the deleted genome and the digested donor end. although the imprecise repair around the targeted integration locus did not affect endogenous gene or exogenous cassette functions when the introns or intergenic regions were targeted, further technological improvements are required for precise targeting of the coding regions to fuse the gene cassettes with endogenous gene products. in addition, we found a few partial knock-in mice defined by double pcr positive for lf + lr and if + ir  in the presence or absence of exo <dig>  the whole plasmid integration by insufficient digestion of right boundary of the pitch-donor or deletion of primer-binding site in mouse genome or pitch-donor caused by dna end resection might result in failure of right boundary amplification. nevertheless, the enhanced pitch system can generate knock-in mice with sufficient efficiency, and the majority of these mice had precise integration of the gene cassette to the endogenous locus, providing opportunities to select precisely targeted knock-in mice.

we found exo <dig> as an mmej enhancer both in human cells and mouse zygotes. exo <dig> is a major 5’–3’ exonuclease, which is critical for the end resection of dsbs to promote mmej  <cit> . the mutation and overexpression of exo <dig> in yeasts are reported to reduce and increase mmej, respectively  <cit> . consistent with this view, we recently reported that the overexpression of exo <dig> increased knockout efficiency possibly through increased mmej in rat zygotes  <cit> . thus, in the enhanced pitch system, exo <dig> may act as the mmej enhancer by resection of the dsb ends of both the endogenous locus and the donor vector, promoting their alignment using microhomology. we also showed that various mmej-related genes and dominant-negative mutants of nhej factors enabled to enhance mmej. the enhancer effect of these genes in gene knock-in should be examined in the future study. on the other hand, additional three genes  involved in the repair pathway of dsbs did not enhance mmej. trex <dig> is also a dna end-processing enzyme, which reportedly enhances gene disruption when overexpressed with site-specific nucleases  <cit> . however, it slightly decreased mmej frequency, suggesting that it is involved in other dsb repair pathways rather than in the mmej pathway. similarly, rad <dig> and rad <dig>  known as hr-specific factors  <cit> , also decreased the mmej frequency.

we additionally investigated whether mismatched bases in microhomologies can be replaced with the donor sequence during the pitch knock-in, by simultaneously targeting the hactb locus and other pseudogenes. although there might be an amplification bias of 5’ and 3’ junctions depending on the sequence variations between primers and target sites , we found two types of off-target knock-in alleles in 5’ junction and another two types in 3’ junction. the sequence comparison between genomic sequences and sequenced alleles revealed that the base-replacing window was around 15 bp. this parameter might be changed when the different length of microhomology is used or different site-specific nucleases such as talens are used, but this finding would be important to design both the target site and microhomologies for pitch knock-in, especially when multiple genomic loci are simultaneously targeted.

the injection of linear pcr donors was enough to reduce the newborn mouse rates in a dose dependent manner. consistent with our data, miura et al. also reported that injection of linear double strand dna donor strongly reduce the newborn mouse rates  <cit> . these results suggest that the low birth rate of newborn mice in pitch system is mainly caused by toxicity of linear donor dna generated by crispr-mediated in situ digestion. the survival rate can be improved by the reduction of pitch donor dose. we showed this modified protocol could also produce knock-in mice without reduction of its efficiency. although transfection of the various doses of exo <dig> expressing plasmids to hek293t cell did not affected their survival, its overexpression in mouse zygotes reduced the newborn rate. a recent report in the human cell line showed that overexpression of trex <dig>  an end-processing enzyme, increased both on- and off-target mutation rates  <cit> , whereas other showed opposite results  <cit> . this suggests the possibility that the overexpression of exo <dig> may also increase off-target mutation rate, leading to the reduction of newborn mouse rate, and thus, the careful guide rna design is also essential.

the development of small molecules that activate exo <dig> may be useful for improvement of knock-in efficiency. scr <dig>  a small compound inhibitor of dna ligase iv, which is responsible for nhej, was recently developed  <cit>  and harnessed to improve the efficiency of hr-mediated knock-in of single nucleotide substitutions and small tags in mice  <cit>  and human cells  <cit>  by suppressing nhej. further, the two small compounds  were also identified as enhancers for hr by chemical screening using the fluorescent hr reporter system  <cit> . similarly, rs- <dig>  a stimulator of rad <dig>  <cit> , is shown to enhance knock-in of long inserts in cellular knock-in screening  <cit>  and rabbits  <cit> . thus, by utilizing the fluorescent reporter system to detect mmej-mediated repair of dsbs, which we used herein, the small compounds that enhance mmej and pitch-mediated gene cassette knock-in could be identified.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a convenient hr-independent method for one-step generation of knock-in human cells and mice carrying gene cassettes and floxed allele without long homology arms by enhanced pitch system.
