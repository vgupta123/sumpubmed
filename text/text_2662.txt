BACKGROUND
strategies for discovering the genetic polymorphism responsible for an identified quantitative trait locus  generally follow two paths. one path involves generating additional experimental mapping populations to narrow an initial, wide qtl support interval  <cit> . for example, yalcin et al.  <cit> , used outbred mice and a qtl-knockout interaction test to identify rgs <dig> as the gene underlying an anxiety phenotype. the other path involves making use of bioinformatic tools and archival data to better nominate candidate genes within a qtl support interval  <cit> . for example, flint and colleagues review and apply a hypothesis of human and mouse sequence conservation that may aid qtl gene or polymorphism discovery  <cit> . the combination of approaches should facilitate polymorphism identification, and more rapidly.

the bxd, an increasingly popular tool for mouse complex trait genetics, are a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived by inbreeding progeny from a c57bl/6j Ã— dba/2j f <dig> intercross  <cit> . because the genetic variation in bxd mice is between line rather than between animal, the bxd panel is a genetic reference population . this useful design allows mapping of qtl affecting a trait by correlating variation among lines to a set of genetic markers available in online databases. in addition, there is a growing collection of databases of gene expression for the bxd lines at  that provides an additional level of genome wide interrogation  <cit> . we believe that this provides an opportunity to combine experimental and bioinformatic approaches from a single bxd mapping experiment to very rapidly and efficiently nominate candidate genes. we propose and validate a five-filter protocol for this purpose, as follows.

 <dig>  list all genes within  <dig> mb of the point of maximum likelihood of the qtl map location.

 <dig>  list all genes that differ in mrna abundance between the parental lines c57bl/6j and dba/2j.

 <dig>  list all genes for which mrna abundance correlates with the target trait among the bxd lines.

 <dig>  identify the genes at the intersection of all three filters and verify mrna abundance of these genes in parent lines and bxd lines by an independent method.

 <dig>  for the genes that remain after the first four filters, demonstrate differences in their dna sequence, or in the levels of the proteins that they encode.

this protocol proved highly effective in identifying two strong candidates in a validation study targeting forebrain weight, and we believe it can serve with equal effectiveness for other traits mapped in the bxd lines, and eventually for traits mapped in the collaborative cross  under development by the complex trait consortium  <cit> .

brain size is a trait of historical and evolutionary interest  <cit> , and is on occasion the focus of unpopular hypotheses related to normal function and individual differences  <cit> . perhaps of greater concern, however, is that the metric is also of importance to biomedical science, where a number of human disorders present developmental alterations in total or component brain size measures . forebrain weight in mice, as in humans, is a surrogate measure of numerous and aggregate developmental processes related to cell division, migration, death, and differentiation  <cit> . given that qtl for human disorders and mouse models thereof have been mapped to homologous chromosomal regions  <cit> , forebrain weight analysis in mice may advance our understanding of developmental mechanisms that contribute to brain size and that have clinical relevance to human health and well-being.

RESULTS
forebrain weight qtls
forebrain weight in  <dig> bxd ri lines and the two parental strains c57bl/6j and dba/2j ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> mg, with a mean  of  <dig> mg . forebrain weight adjusted for variation in body weight, age, sex, and brain weight other than forebrain , was expectedly reduced in total variation , but otherwise retained the approximate normal distribution of the unadjusted forebrain weight, and was well correlated with unadjusted weight .

simple interval mapping of adjusted forebrain weight revealed two qtls on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig>  with likelihood ratio statistics  above a significance threshold determined by  <dig>  permutations of the data . each c57bl/6j allele was estimated to increase adjusted forebrain weight by  <dig> mg, somewhat more than half a standard deviation in effect size. a pairwise scan using the direct algorithm for epistasis detection  <cit>  implemented at  did not discover significant interaction between these or other loci.

filter 1: candidates near to the forebrain weight qtls
a total of  <dig> genes were found within ten megabases of the highest lrs for the qtls discovered on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  with  <dig> genes between  <dig> mb and  <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> genes between  <dig> and  <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig> .

filter 2: candidates with microarray gene expression correlated with forebrain weight
a total of  <dig> genes had expression levels that correlated significantly with adjusted forebrain weight  across  <dig> bxd ri lines. of these,  <dig> identified genes were within  <dig> mb of the qtl fbrwt <dig> and  <dig> were within  <dig> mb of the qtl fbrwt <dig> .

filter 3: candidates with microarray gene expression differences in c57bl/6j and dba/2j
a total of  <dig>  genes were significantly different comparing three u74av <dig> microarrays with pooled c57bl/6j forebrain rna against three u74av <dig> microarrays with pooled dba/2j forebrain rna by t-test  . of the  <dig> genes retained by filters  <dig> and  <dig>  two genes were also shown to have differential gene expression between the c57bl/6j and dba/2j . these were tnni <dig>  or troponin  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  and asb <dig>  or ankyrin repeat and socs box-containing protein  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  for both genes, the c57bl/6j allele increased expression, with a  <dig> fold change for tnni <dig> and a  <dig> fold change for asb <dig> 

because multiple data sets of forebrain microarray gene expression are available at , we also looked at the expression of tnni <dig> and asb <dig> in one additional microarray data set. we compared  <dig> c57bl/6j and  <dig> dba/2j affymetrix m <dig> chips, by t-test. this data set confirmed that c57bl/6j again had higher transcript abundance for tnni <dig>  and asb <dig> .

when either tnni <dig> or asb <dig> transcript abundance is mapped to locate qtls controlling expression, both show strong evidence of control by cis-eqtls . tnni <dig> transcript abundance maps to the chromosomal location of itself with an lrs of  <dig>   and  <dig>  . asb <dig> transcript abundance maps to the chromosomal location of itself with an lrs of  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

in summary, candidate gene tnni <dig> lies near  to the position of highest lrs for the fbrwt <dig> qtl , has gene expression variation in the bxd mapping population that correlates with the mapped phenotype , and also has gene expression that differs between bxd parental inbred strains c57bl/6j and dba/2j . similarly, candidate gene asb <dig> lies near  to the position of the highest lrs for the fbrwt <dig> qtl , has gene expression that correlates with forebrain weight , and also has gene expression difference between c57bl/6j and dba/2j .

filters  <dig> and 5: confirmation by rt-pcr  and western blot 
to verify gene expression differences with an independent method, reverse transcriptase pcr was performed on c57bl/6j and dba/2j forebrain total rna. both tnni <dig> and asb <dig> showed greater transcript abundance in c57bl/6j relative to dba/2j, with tnni <dig>  <dig> -fold different, and asb <dig>  <dig> -fold different. two bxd strains with high  and low  microarray expression for asb <dig> were also analyzed by rt-pcr, indicating a  <dig>  fold increase in mrna expression in bxd <dig> forebrain compared to bxd <dig> forebrain. finally, using an antibody against asb <dig> protein, western blot analysis showed a  <dig>  fold increase in bxd <dig> forebrain compared to bxd <dig> forebrain .

tnni <dig> promoter sequence analysis
although we were unable to verify differences in tnni <dig> protein abundance , we were able to discover a  <dig> bp insertion located  <dig> bp upstream of the tnni <dig> transcription start site, that was present in dba/2j mice, but absent in c57bl/6j mice . c57bl/6j sequences confirmed those published in genbank for the tnni <dig> promoter. bioinformatic analysis of the indel polymorphism suggests the presence of multiple transcription factor binding sites .

discussion
synopsis
using a five-filter protocol for qtl candidate gene nomination that combines classical trait qtl mapping with gene expression data in bxd mice, we provide convergent evidence that nominates troponin  <dig>  and ankyrin repeat and socs box-containing protein  <dig>  as candidate genes for qtls affecting mouse forebrain weight variation, with c57bl/6j alleles conferring increased weight over dba/2j alleles. to nominate these candidate genes, we required candidate genes near to the forebrain weight qtl to have correlated mrna abundance among the bxd lines as well as a difference between the parental lines c57bl/6j and dba/2j. we further required verification of mrna abundance by an independent method, and finally we required either differences in protein levels or confirmed dna sequence differences. tnni <dig> and asb <dig> met each of these requirements.

tnni <dig> and asb <dig> in brain development
asb <dig> encodes a member of the ankyrin repeat and socs box containing proteins  <cit> . ankyrin repeats are a common motif involved in molecular recognition via protein-protein interactions. the socs box found in the asb family of proteins targets suppressor of cytokine signaling  proteins with the elongin b/c complex and can be involved in targeting for degredation. asb <dig> is widely expressed, including high levels of expression in the brain and mediates ubiquitination and degredation of tumor necrosis factor receptor ii . asb <dig> protein is thus also involved in inhibition of tnf-r2-mediated jun n-terminal protein kinase  activation. jnk is involved in cortical neuron migration  <cit>  and may be involved in signaling cell survival in developing forebrain  <cit>  which suggests a role for asb <dig> in forebrain development.

tnni <dig> encodes the slow-twitch muscle isoform of troponin i  <cit> , the inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex. although we could not verify the effect of tnni <dig> transcript differences on protein levels, we did discover a  <dig> base pair indel polymorphism upstream of the transcription start site of tnni <dig> in which we found bioinformatic evidence for transcription factor binding sites. without testing a broader sample of inbred lines for the presence of the indel and tnni <dig> expression, it remains unknown if this polymorphism is an interfering insertion, reducing dba/2j tnni <dig> transcription. nonetheless, a working hypothesis is that the discovered indel is a tnni <dig> promoter variant underlying the cis-eqtl for tnni <dig> mrna abundance and the qtl for forebrain weight. tnni <dig> is typically expressed in skeletal muscle  <cit> , and functions to prevent actin-myosin interaction, but it is also considered a cytoskeletal element in some neurons  <cit> . we demonstrated that tnni <dig> mrna is also found in the mouse brain, and we suggest it may have alternative functions in cns tissue, perhaps during development. this is particularly interesting because of recent work on mutations in other cytoskeletal element genes and their roles in human brain size and microcephaly  <cit> .

previous study of brain size in the bxd
an earlier paper by belknap et al.,  <cit>  reported two qtl affecting brain to body weight ratios on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  in a sample of  <dig> bxd ri lines. the qtl reported on chr  <dig> is in the same proximal location as fbrw <dig> reported above. as defined, our forebrain weights included midbrain and forebrain , but excluded olfactory bulbs and the brain stem . we also used linear regression to control body weights rather than ratios  <cit> , and unlike belknap et al.,  <cit> , we included both sexes, and used a wider range of ages. nonetheless, the genetic correlation between our measures and those reported more than  <dig> years ago in table  <dig> in  <cit>  for total brain weight to body weight ratios for male mice is r =  <dig>    <cit> . it is therefore possible that the same genetic signal  underlies both qtls. a more recent study on neocortex volume and remaining brain volume among bxd lines suggests that the genetic signal is mostly expressed in neocortex variation. beatty and laughlin  <cit>  reported a qtl for neocortex volume in the same location as fbrw11; noncortical brain volume did not reach statistical significance on proximal chr  <dig> after genome-wide multiple test correction  <cit> . the correlation between our forebrain weights and the neocortex volumes was r =  <dig>  .

advantages and disadvantages of the five-filter protocol
the literature is replete with reviews describing a status quo of relative ease of qtl identification and great difficulty discovering the underlying polymorphism . indeed, without bioinformatic support, the purely experimental path to polymorphism identification is effortful, long, and without guaranteed success. a key pillar of the protocol we describe is use of the bxd genetic reference population and the availability of gene expression data on each bxd line. the list and specificity of traits for which bxd gene expression is available is growing rapidly, and already contains different organs as well as specific cell types . multiple conditions are also coming online  or environmental manipulations ). it is not strictly necessary for the gene expression database to exactly match the measured trait for our five-filter protocol to be applied. behavioral phenotypes could reasonably be correlated to brain expression databases . certainly, the correlations would become more relevant with a more specific expression database , and cases can be conjectured for which our approach would be uninterpretable . in such cases, our suggested protocol is not flawed, but the available resources would need generating . in the present study, for example, we used adult gene expression to make inferences about development of forebrain weight. this will work in cases where developmental switches are left on  but will fail with temporally limited gene expression differences . more complete results will come from application of the five filters to a developmental forebrain gene expression database.

some of the strengths of our protocol are also disadvantages. the use of bxd mice necessarily limits the number of genomes investigated to only two common inbred strains . unfortunately, there is a dearth of large mouse recombinant inbred line panels, although this may change in the future  <cit> . our results, for example, could be extended by validating brain weight as measured in the current bxd ri lines  <cit>  to the more recently developed, advanced intercross derived bxd ri lines  <cit> . finally, nominating genes that act through gene expression also presents an obvious weakness, by missing gene variants that cause null or poorly trafficked proteins, for example. despite these limitations, the methods we illustrate warrant careful consideration by those working with phenotypic differences between c57bl/6j and dba/2j.

CONCLUSIONS
delivery of well supported candidate genes following a single quantitative trait locus mapping experiment is difficult. however, by combining available gene expression data with qtl mapping, we illustrated a five-filter protocol that nominated asb <dig> and tnni <dig> as candidates affecting increased mouse forebrain weight. we recommend our approach when  investigators are working with phenotypic differences between c57bl/6j and dba/2j, and  gene expression data are available on  that relate to the phenotype of interest. under these circumstances, measurement of the phenotype in the bxd lines will likely also deliver excellent candidate genes.
