BACKGROUND
the filamentous fungus aspergillus niger is an industrially exploited cell factory with a broad product portfolio including primary metabolites, proteins and enzymes  <cit> . recent data proved that a. niger can also serve as a suitable host for secondary metabolite production  <cit> . additionaly, a. niger is a model system used to study fundamental molecular and cellular processes. various selection systems are available for transformation of a. niger, including nutritional  and antibiotic resistance  markers . recently this set was expanded by two new nutritional markers  which can be used for gene deletion in a. niger  <cit> . however, in order to study the function and interplay of several genes, or to construct/re-engineer a complete metabolic pathway in a. niger, it is of advantage having a range of selection markers at hand to choose the best one suited for a given approach. the number of nutritional markers for a. niger is limited to seven, as recently published  <cit>  and although marker recycling using the cre/loxp system has been established for aspergilli  <cit> , they often suffer from poor recombination events ranging from  <dig> to 20%. so far, within the set of nutritional selection markers available for a. niger, only the pyrg and agaa loci  <cit>  meet the need of a well characterized locus for efficient homologous integration of single copy expression cassettes. in fungi, a transcriptionally active, non-protein encoding locus that is targeted by exogenous expression cassettes at high frequency has been an important molecular technique underlying transformation, mutant complementation, and functional genomic approaches to study gene function  <cit> . even the highly efficient crispr/cas system which has been applied recently for filamentous fungi , depends on well characterized loci for genomic integration of the genes of interest.

in order to establish an alternative auxotrophic selection marker for a. niger, which can also be used for both gene targeting or insertion of an expression cassette into a well characterised locus, we chose the histidine biosynthesis pathway as a target. this pathway was intensively studied in salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli and corynebacterium glutamicum  and in a. nidulans  <cit> . it generates histidine in ten reaction steps catalysed by seven enzymes in a branched pathway out of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate supplied via the pentose phosphate pathway. as it was shown that deletion of hisb in a. nidulans and a. fumigatus results in histidine auxotrophy  <cit> , we selected hisb, which catalyses the sixth step in the histidine biosynthesis pathway and disrupted it via a direct targeting approach in a. niger. subsequent integration of the well-established tet-on system  <cit>  using luciferase as reporter gene enabled us to evaluate gene expression characteristics at the hisb locus in comparison to the widely used pyrg locus. we could furthermore demonstrate that genome editing using the hisb orthologue of a. nidulans is feasable.

to obtain pyrg
- strains via counterselection,  <dig> x  <dig> spores were plated on mm plates containing  <dig> mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid ,  <dig> mm uridine,  <dig> mm proline and  <dig> mm histidine. plates were incubated at 30°c for 1- <dig> weeks until single colonies were visible. foa-resistant mutants were purified on mm + foa plates once and tested for their uridine auxothrophy on mm plates containing  <dig> mm histidine or  <dig> mm histidine and  <dig> mm uridine, respectively.

all molecular techniques were performed according to standard procedures  <cit>  and the transformation, genomic dna extraction and southern blot were performed as described elsewhere  <cit> .

construction of a hisb disruption vector
to construct a hisb disruption plasmid we used an approach which was published recently  <cit> . in brief,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp sequences of the hisb coding and 3’ sequence were amplified via pcr using primers listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  both fragments were inserted via gibson cloning into the bsrgi linearized plasmid pao4- <dig> carrying the a. oryzae pyrg gene  <cit>  giving rise to the counter-selectable hisb disruption plasmid pmf <dig> .

construction of an olva deletion cassette
the plasmid paw <dig>  containing the aopyrg gene flanked by the 5’ and 3’ region of olva was used as a backbone. the a. nidulans hisb  gene was amplified using primers listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and cloned into the xhoi/hindiii linearized paw <dig> via gibson cloning giving rise to plasmid pse <dig> .

construction of luciferase reporter constructs
the a. niger
 pyrg* gene within tet-on plasmids pvg <dig>   and pvg <dig>   was replaced by a  <dig> bp fragment amplified by fusion pcr, containing the full length hisb gene without a functional start codon flanked by 5’ and 3’ region of the hisb gene, giving rise to ptg <dig>  and ptg <dig> , respectively .

measurement of the luciferase activity
ninety six well microtiter plate assays were performed as described earlier  <cit>  with slight modifications. in brief,  <dig> x  <dig> spores were inoculated in  <dig> μl cm medium  <cit>  supplemented  <dig>  mm luciferin and  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> μg/ml  doxycycline in a microtiter plate and incubated at 30°c in a victor <dig> . od and luminescence were measured every  <dig> min.

RESULTS
in order to construct an alternative auxotrophic marker for a. niger, we choose the a. niger orthologue of the well characterised s. cerevisiae selection marker his <dig>  the gene codes for an imidazole-glycerol-phosphate dehydratase which catalyses the sixth step of the histidine biosynthesis in s. cerevisiae, by specifically dehydrating imidazole-glycerol-3-phosphate, producing imidazole-acetole-phosphate . proteins blasts of the his <dig> sequence against translated a. niger orfs  <cit>  revealed a single orthologue  for his <dig> in the genome of a. niger with a protein sequence identity of  <dig> %, which was termed hisb. it is well known that gene expression depends on both position effects and on the availability of transcription factors  <cit> . we thus analysed whether gene expression levels of hisb and the widely used pyrg are comparable by scrutinzing an in-house database, which comprises genome-wide expression profiles of a. niger from  <dig> different cultivation conditions  <cit> . as depicted in fig.  <dig>  hisb is expressed under all conditions covered in the transcriptomic database in a range comparable to the pyrg gene .fig.  <dig> pathway of histidine biosynthesis in a. niger according to the kegg database  <cit>  including respective orf codes or protein names of proteins for a. niger, a. nidulans  <cit>  and s. cerevisiae  <cit> 


fig.  <dig> expression profile of the a. niger pyrg and hisb genes. our in-house transcriptomic database for a. niger covering  <dig> growth conditions was analyzed for hisb and pyrg expression levels. gene expression levels were normalized against actin  expression during the exponential growth phase of a. niger in maltose-based bioreactor cultivation. for improved visualization, data were assorted ascending for the pyrg expression level




we used a gene disruption approach published earlier  <cit>  to inactivate the hisb gene. a part of the open reading frame of the hisb gene was integrated together with the 3’ region of hisb into poa4- <dig> which contains the aspergillus oryzae pyrg gene as selection marker  <cit>  giving rise to plasmid pmf <dig> . subsequent transformation of the vector into a pyrg
- strain lacking a functional non-homologues-end-joining-pathway   <cit> , resulted in a single recombination event whereby the hisb gene became disrupted . counterselection on plates containing fluoroorotic acid   allowed recombination events between the duplicated parts of the hisb gene, thereby restoring gene functionality . alternatively, recombination between the 3’ regions resulted in a nonfunctional truncated hisb  . in total,  <dig> primary transformants were obtained from which  <dig> were randomly selected and tested for histidine auxotrophy. one of four transformants unable to grow on minimal medium  lacking histidine  was counterselected as described in material and methods, resulting in  <dig> pyrg cured strains, which were purified and tested for their histidine auxotrophy. only  <dig> strains out of  <dig> were found to be auxotrophic for histidine , although the duplicated parts of the hisb gene and the 3’ regions did only differ in  <dig> bp in length. from the set of strains which were screened for histidine and uridine auxotrophy, strain mf <dig>   was chosen for further analysis. the auxotrophy was stable under non-selective conditions, which was proven by several rounds of cultivation on complete medium supplemented with  <dig> mm histidine and uridine. after three rounds, mf <dig>  still remained unable to grow on mm lacking uridine or histidine , which is in good agreement with earlier work published for a. nidulans and a. fumigatus, which showed that deletion of hisb leads to auxotrophic strains, which can be rescued by the addition of 1- <dig> mm histidine to the medium, thereby restoring wildtype-like growth  <cit> . the truncated hisb* locus in mf <dig>  was subsequently sequenced and compared to the hisb locus of ma <dig> , showing the expected dna modifications . in order to exclude polygenetic effects in subsequent phenotypic analysis caused by deletion of two essential auxotrophic gene markers, we restored the pyrg gene in mf <dig>  by transforming this strain with linearized plasmid pab <dig>   <cit> , containing the full length a. niger pyrg gene, giving strain mf <dig> . this strain was able to grow on plates lacking uridine and the correct integration of the linearized fragment was confirmed via southern blot analysis .fig.  <dig> schematic overview of the hisb disruption approach in a. niger and subsequent counterselection. the plasmid pmf <dig>  was constructed via amplifying parts of the hisb gene and its 3’ region . both fragments were inserted via gibson cloning into the bsrgi linearized plasmid pao4- <dig> carrying the aspergillus oryzae pyrg  <cit>  giving rise to the plasmid pmf <dig> . the plasmid was transformed into the strain ma <dig>   <cit>  thereby disrupting the hisb locus giving rise to mf <dig> . counterselection may either lead to a genomic rearrangement, thereby eliminating the plasmid via recombination in its hisb locus or the 5’ region, creating a truncated hisb*  or wildtype hisb loci, respectively




to evaluate whether the a. nidulans hisb gene  could be used as selection marker to complement the histidine auxotrophy, the genomic and protein sequences were compared using blastn and blastp, revealing a high conservation  on the protein level, whereas the nucleotide sequence conservation was considerably lower , which was thought to be crucial for the correct integration of the deletion cassette into the region of choice instead of complementing a. niger hisb gene at its endogenous locus. for an easy read-out of the transformation and gene replacement efficiency, the olva gene was chosen. this gene encodes a hydrolase involved in dhn-melanin synthesis in a. niger and its deletion results in an incomplete melanin biosynthesis and thus green spore formation  <cit> .

in doing so, plasmids pse <dig>   and paw <dig>  were linearized and transformed into mf <dig>   or ma <dig>  , respectively. analysis of total transformants and spore color analysis revealed that deletion of olva with the a. nidulans hisb gene leads to a deletion efficiency comparable to the pyrg marker . strains carrying the a. nidulans hisb gene at either the olva locus or ectopically integrated into the genome were selected, purified, spotted on cm and compared to the olva::aopyrg strain aw <dig>  and ma <dig>  with an ectopically integrated copy of paw <dig>  no macroscopic differences were detected between mutant or wild type strains except spore color formation .table  <dig> homologous recombination efficiency of individual transformations, as assessed by phenotypic spore color screening using a. oryzae pyrg and a. nidulans hisb as selection markers to delete the olva gene in kusa

a luciferase based reporter system was used to test whether the truncated hisb* locus is suitable to allow gene expression of a gene of interest. in doing so, the luciferase reporter constructs ptg <dig>   and ptg <dig>   were constructed. both plasmids should integrate into the truncated hisb* locus via a single recombination event, because the a. niger hisb gene was used as selection marker, thereby restoring its functionality . transformation of mf <dig>  resulted in  <dig> primary transformants for ptg <dig>  and  <dig> primary transformants for ptg <dig> , respectively. for both strains,  <dig> out of  <dig> transformants were proven by diagnostic pcr to harbor the expression constructs at hisb*, which was further confirmed via southern analysis . transformants tg <dig>  , tg <dig>   were selected and their luciferase activity determined and compared to the previously published strains vg <dig>  and vg <dig>   <cit> , harboring the tet-on::pyrg* or tet-on-mluc::pyrg* constructs at the pyrg locus, respectively .fig.  <dig> luciferase activity assay of strains containing the tet-on::mluc construct integrated into the hisb* or pyrg loci. the luciferase activity assay was performed as described earlier  <cit>  ﻿using  <dig> μg/ml  or  <dig> μg/ml  doxycycline for induction. strains tg <dig>  and vg <dig>  are negative-control strains , while strains tg <dig>  and vg <dig>  carry the tet-on::mluc constructs integrated at the hisb or pyrg locus, respectively. mean values of triplicate experiments are shown




while the luminescence activity of the strains carrying the reporter construct integrated into the pyrg or hisb locus are comparable , the values of the tg <dig>  are  <dig> times higher when using  <dig> μg/ml doxycycline, possibly reflecting a higher transcriptional activity at the hisb locus under the conditions used. it is notable that neither the vector control  nor the non-induced luciferase constructs  showed any luciferase activity during the experiment, clearly demonstrating that the system is tight at the hisb locus in the absence of the inducer.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report here a straight forward approach to rationally generate auxotrophic markers in the filamentous fungus a. niger which was employed to create a histidine auxotrophic strain which can be used as a recipient isolate for endogenous deletion of genes using the a. nidulans orthologue hisb. in addition, we characterized the hisb* locus for functionality to integrate expression constructs, which revealed an expression level for the luciferase reporter with a higher performance and tighter characteristics under non-induced conditions compared to the well-used pyrg locus. the tools described here significantly increase the tractability of a. niger at the molecular level and suggest hisb could be used for similar applications in other model or pathogenic filamentous fungi.
