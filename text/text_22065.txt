BACKGROUND
chickens and other birds are homeotherms that require that their body temperatures are maintained within a limited range during pre- and post-hatch processes  <cit> . altering the temperature range during the critical developmental periods may cause only minor morphological differences, or could even produce lethal events. since under natural conditions unpredictable periods may occur when incubation temperatures are unfavorable, natural selection could have promoted traits and mechanisms that provide resilience against such exogenous factors and that are reflected by immediate, acute or long-term, delayed responses . shifts in the incubation temperature of eggs under controlled experimental conditions have been shown to impact post-hatch development in several bird species. however, results of previous studies are inconsistent. for example, a higher incubation temperature was concluded to positively affect breast meat yield in featherless broilers  <cit>  and muscle fiber size in turkey  <cit> , but was associated with body weight loss in live chicken  <cit> . similarly, lower incubation temperature was indicated to have a prolonged effect on female embryo mortality in australian brush-turkey  <cit> , but reportedly reduced growth rates of wood duck  <cit> . thus, the effects of incubation temperature changes on post-hatch development remain unclear. in particular, there is a lack of studies addressing the response to exogenous physical effects on the level of gene expression that will promote the understanding of the underlying compensatory, adaptive and regulatory process that might be associated with the treatment.

the in-ovo development of birds offers a valuable model in which to study environmental effects on myogenesis. indeed, the identification of shifts in muscle and growth traits facilitates the detection of candidate genes for these traits. during avian myogenesis, the muscle fibers are formed in two phases. the primary muscle fiber, which is a core fiber, transforms to a myotube between the 4th and 7th embryonic days . next, secondary muscle fibers, which are smaller and derive from myoblasts, arrange around the primary muscle fiber as a scaffold, proceeding until e <dig>  <cit> . fetal myoblasts are most abundant between e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . after the secondary phase, depending on morphology and localization of the myofibers, the adult myoblasts will transform and become the primary source of myogenic precursors for postnatal muscle formation . during both critical stages, temperature manipulation may cause differential expression of genes to produce phenotypic changes. previous studies showed that elevated incubation temperature over e7- <dig> positively influenced carcass traits in broiler males, but did not affect meat quality  <cit> . thus, shifting the incubation temperature during targeted periods of in-ovo development could contribute to the improvement of the efficiency of broiler meat production, without sacrificing meat quality. this study addresses the transcriptomic response of skeletal muscle tissue to transient reduction and elevation of incubation temperature at early  and late  secondary muscle fiber development. microarray expression profiles of treated samples were compared to those of the respective controls immediate after the treatment periods  and also later at slaughter . the results have implication for the molecular foundation of potential impact on meat production traits and also provide insight into the mechanisms involved in the resilience against low and the phenotypic plasticity against high incubation temperature.fig.  <dig> experimental design; indicating the two periods of modulated incubation temperatures at e7- <dig> and e10- <dig> and the time points of samplings

distinct response to temperature alteration by time and direction
a comparison of the degs between treatment conditions showed that most degs were unique for each condition, e.g.,  <dig> and  <dig> degs for h10Δc and l13Δc in the embryonic stages , and  <dig> and  <dig> degs for l10Δc and l13Δc at d <dig> , respectively. some degs were shared between two conditions, including those common either to l <dig> and l <dig>  or to h <dig> and h <dig> , which were almost exclusively consistently regulated. there were only a few degs that were common across more than  <dig> conditions. comparisons of degs from identical treatments in embryonic and d <dig> samples  revealed  <dig> common degs in total for the  <dig> treatments. of these,  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated transcript ids were regulated in the same direction in both embryonic stages and at d <dig>  however, most of the common degs were regulated in opposite directions by stage, e.g., up-regulation in embryos and down-regulation at d <dig>  a list of common degs with fold-change and p-value is available in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> venn diagrams displaying numbers of differentially expressed genes for each treatment condition relative to control. comparisons between treatment conditions at embryonic stages  and at d <dig>  as well as between embryonic stages and d <dig> after the same treatments  



pathway analysis
to understand the underlying biology and identify relevant pathways, degs were analyzed using the ingenuity pathway analysis software tools . all degs lists were separated into up- or down-regulated genes for each comparison . all significant biological pathways associated with p-values and gene members are available in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the pathway analysis approach is effective for handling a list of degs, and generates a list of biological terms/pathways. to encompass most pathways affected by all treatment factors , we grouped  <dig> and  <dig> significant pathways derived from embryos and d <dig> broiler, respectively, into eight major categories of interest: group   <dig>  cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation and replacement; gr. <dig>  organismal, organ, and tissue development; gr. <dig>  nutrient metabolism; gr. <dig>  genetic information and nucleic acid processing; gr. <dig>  molecular transport; gr. <dig>  cell signaling and interaction; gr. <dig>  small molecule biochemistry; and gr. <dig>  response to stimuli. overall, biological pathways involved in cell growth  and tissue development  were affected by modification of incubation temperature both in embryos and at d <dig> based on the number of pathways, as shown in fig.  <dig>  activation states of upstream regulators were further analyzed for the dataset based on the z-score calculation from ingenuity pathway analysis  .fig.  <dig> significant pathways altered by in-ovo thermal modifications; in  embryonic stage and  d <dig>  degs associated with each comparison  are separated into up-regulation  or down-regulation . thermal modification treatments: increase  or decrease  incubation temperature during e7- <dig>  or e10- <dig> . significant pathways  are grouped into eight major categories of interest; group  <dig> cell maintenance proliferation differentiation and replacement, gr. <dig> organismal organ and tissue development, gr. <dig> nutrient metabolism, gr. <dig> genetic information and nucleic acid processing, gr. <dig> molecular transport, gr. <dig> cell signaling and interaction, gr. <dig> small molecule biochemistry, and gr. <dig> response to stimuli and associated. the –log  associated with significant pathways are plotted in green  to red 



in particular, a higher temperature during e7- <dig>  altered pathways involved in lipid metabolism, cell signaling, energy metabolism, muscle development and function, and small molecule biochemistry, more so than did other conditions in embryos . z-scores indicate that h10Δc condition tended to activate several pathways related to nutrient metabolism  and small molecule biochemistry  . a lower temperature  affected pathways related cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation and replacement  and organismal, organ, and tissue development . l13Δc tended to suppress cellar processes related to cell death, thus promoting maintenance in the major category cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation and replacement  and to activate developmental processes in mesoderm and muscle  .

discussion
this study demonstrates that transcriptomic and pathway regulation changes occur in broiler embryos and at d <dig> as a result of temperature manipulation during early  and later  development stage. evidence was reported that early elevated incubation temperature positively influenced growth traits, but did not affect meat quality  <cit> . indeed the chicken analyzed here showed slight but significant increase in body weight when transiently incubated at higher temperature, whereas decreased incubation temperature did not affect body weight.

immediate effects observed in-ovo
embryonic days 7– <dig> and 10– <dig> cover the final stage of primary muscle formation and start of secondary muscle fiber formation, respectively  <cit> . during myogenesis, multiple transcripts have major roles in regulating muscle development, such as bck   <cit> , ctnt   <cit> , mstn , and myod   <cit> . previous research showed many regulated genes expressed during myogenesis being sensitive to incubation temperature manipulation.

immediate response to early high temperature treatment 
due to our experiment, the major impacts on the transcriptome resulted from early high  and late low  temperature shifts, with the majority of degs being up regulated. the h10Δc comparison indicated that pathways involved in lipid metabolism, energy production, oxidation and beta-oxidation of fatty acid were activated. in this network,  <dig> up-regulated degs were represented, including fabp <dig>  ppara, and ppargc1a.

fabp <dig> and ppara act in fatty acid uptake, metabolism, and intracellular transportation of lipids metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and respiration as well as inflammation responses  <cit> . a previous study showed that l-fabp in chicken had higher expression in fat-type chicken at  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 weeks old , and is linked to abdominal fat deposition and high lipogenesis rate  <cit> . moreover, a previous study showed shifts of expression of ampk-ppara pathway genes due to thermal conductions  <cit> . ppargc <dig>  regulates energy metabolism, muscle fiber specialization and adaptive thermogenesis . a previous study reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms  in chicken ppargc1a are significantly related to abdominal fat weight without growth trait effects  <cit> . moreover, ppargc1a  which was influenced by cold-stress  in chicken could influenced a change in fiber type distribution and phenotype  <cit> . exemplarily, modulated expressions of these genes reflect shifts of biological functions related to growth and metabolism.

the results demonstrate immediate shifts of transcript abundance due to manipulation of incubation temperature. during e7- <dig>  high temperature  manipulation influenced mainly lipid  and energy production  pathway. accordingly, changes of body, liver, and heart weight were evident  <cit> . moreover, activity of mitochondrial respiration  and enzyme activities  were elevated  <cit> . thus, h <dig> treatment could influence lipid production and metabolism and also promoted phenotypic change.

immediate response to late low temperature treatment 
at later development , low temperature had a greater impact on the transcriptome . the biological functions affected were predicted to affect cellular processes balancing differentiation, proliferation and maintenance. in contrast, high temperature treatment down regulated the development of cytoplasm and vasculogenesis, but increased inflammation and cell death. the l13Δc network related to cell death and survival and cellular growth and proliferation. candidate degs included gpi, nr1h <dig>  and srf, involved in metabolic, proliferation, and differentiation pathways.

in fact gpi encodes a member of the glucose phosphate isomerase protein family, involved in glucose metabolism  <cit> . in chicken, gpi is up-regulated in muscle development  <cit> . nr1h <dig> belongs to the nr <dig> subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily , which are key regulators of macrophage function, inflammation, and lipid homeostasis in differentiating chondrocytes  <cit> . in chicken, nr1h <dig> is considered a key regulator of fatty acid homeostasis  <cit>  and cholesterol homeostasis  <cit> . srf encodes a ubiquitous nuclear protein that stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation. in chicken embryo, srf expression is restricted primarily to striated muscle cell lineages, which increased mass of nuclear and activating alpha-actin gene activity  <cit> .

later in e10- <dig>  lower temperature  was associated with shifts of pathways towards balancing anabolic and catabolic pathways, which is in line with phenotypic change being slight and non-significant  <cit> . enzyme activity  and mitochondrial respiration  were lower than at normal condition. it was suggested that lower temperature at late treatment might decelerate embryonic activity.

long-term effects observed at d35
in-ovo shifts of thermal conditions had long term effects on the transcriptome observed at d <dig>  higher or lower incubation temperature has also been shown to impact postnatal development in avian species  <cit> . because the egg shell temperature is sensitive to environmental change, it can directly impact developmental processes as well  <cit> . acute temperature modulation at the late embryonic stage was previously suggested to cause long-term transcriptomic changes, but few studies demonstrated an ongoing effect. a recent report showed embryonic temperature manipulation affected thermoregulatory mechanisms  <cit> . another study found that periodic incubation temperature change between  <dig>  °c and  <dig>  °c from e16- <dig> initiated acute  and late-term  positive effects on diameter of myofibers and muscle cell proliferation in chicken  <cit> . these findings might have been resulted from modifications to the stress response and thermogenesis by the increased temperature from e7- <dig>  resulting in reduced oxygen consumption, heart rate, and egg shell temperature. these changes directly affected broiler embryo growth and development  <cit> . similarly, another study showed that temperature manipulation caused a high density of blood vessels in the chorioallantoic membrane during embryogenesis  <cit> . in our studies, long-term transcriptomic changes were due to low temperature treatments  primarily leading to down-regulation. ipa analysis indicated that increasing the incubation temperature to  <dig> ° may influence cell cycle and skin development at the early time point . after that, high temperature e10- <dig> treatment tended to activate apoptosis in cell development but deactivated cardiovascular system and body trunk. effects on metabolic process showed a reduction of carbohydrate metabolism, synthesis. furthermore, a negative effect still remained for concentration of lipid and acylglycerol.

long-term response to early low temperature treatment 
the lower incubation temperature resulted in more degs in both early and late treatments. early low temperature  tended to activate pathways involved in organismal development and cell proliferation but strongly suppress transcriptional process. all significant pathways including gene expression, cellular function and maintenance, and organismal development formed a network. candidate genes included hdac <dig>  myod <dig>  and sox <dig>  which are related to inactivation of transcription and muscle cell differentiation.

previous research showed hdac <dig> was associated in modulating cell growth and differentiation by controlling histone deacetylase activity, which alters chromosome structure and affects transcription factor access to dna  <cit> . a negative effect of hdac <dig> overexpression is down-regulation of cardiac muscle gene expression and leads to inhibition of cardiomyogenesis  <cit> . normally hdac <dig> was found in neuromuscular junction especially in myonuclei of fast oxidative skeletal muscle fibers  <cit> . down regulated of this gene suggested multiple transcriptional abnormalities including cardiac hypertrophy  <cit>  and influence to myod <dig> expression. myod <dig> encodes a protein that belongs to a basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors and the myogenic factors subfamily. generally, myod <dig> acts in muscle cell differentiation by inducing cell cycle arrest. during pre-gastrulating epiblast in chicken, myod <dig> can induce skeletal muscle lineage self-renewal and differentiation  <cit> . moreover, myod <dig> also works with the downstream effector vgl- <dig> in skeletal myogenesis  <cit> . another degs which suggested to downregulate in cardiac and skeletal muscle is sox <dig>  a member of the soxd gene family, encodes functional domains including a dna binding domain  and two coiled-coil domains  <cit> . the encoded protein is a transcriptional activator and critical role in cartilage development and mesenchymal differentiation  <cit> . moreover, sox <dig> is well known to function as a transcriptional suppressor of slow fiber-specific genes  <cit> .

lowered incubation temperature had large effects on postnatal expression in terms of number of transcripts with shifted abundance. manipulation of early treatment  led to down regulation in transcriptional processes and muscle cell differentiation. moreover, cardio  and skeletal  myogenesis were negatively affected. the phenotype of d <dig> chicken exposed to lower temperature showed a slight non-significant reduction of carcass and leg compared to the control group; higher incubation temperature led to increased weights .

long-term response to late low temperature treatment 
late low temperature treatment  was predicted to activate pathways in cellular and organismal development including cell survival, development of body trunk, contractility of cardiac muscle, and proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, but to have a negative effect on size of body and muscle cell pathways. in metabolism, elevated uptake and metabolism of lipid and carbohydrate, together with small molecule biochemistry like oxidation of fatty acid, tended to reduce concentration of lipid. inflammatory response was also predicted to be suppressed. the ipa network highlighted the activation of tissue development, skeletal and muscular disorders, and cell-to-cell signaling. selection of fold change  related in every major category revealed a set of candidate genes: apod, apoa <dig>  des, and gfpt <dig> 

apod encodes a component of high-density lipoprotein  with a high degree of homology to plasma retinol-binding protein and lipocalins. during late chicken embryogenesis, the expression of apod is enriched among subsets of central nervous system  neurons then again in skin during developing of feather  <cit> . the molecular function involved lipoprotein metabolism, as shown by apoa <dig>  hdl, and ldl in the network fig. 5b. apoa <dig> is the major protein component of high-density lipoprotein in plasma. it promotes cholesterol efflux from tissues to the liver for excretion, and is a cofactor for lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase , which is responsible for the formation of most plasma cholesteryl esters. apoa <dig> is negatively correlated with aging and influences muscle development in thai indigenous chicken  <cit> . desmin  encodes a muscle-specific class iii intermediate filament. homopolymers of this protein form a stable intra-cytoplasmic filamentous network connecting myofibrils to each other and to the plasma membrane. it maintains the structural integrity of highly solicited skeletal muscle and is important to other biological processes including muscle contraction and development, especially in heart contraction . gfpt <dig> controls the flux of glucose into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, providing building blocks for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids  <cit> . the product of this gene catalyzes the formation of glucosamine 6-phosphate, which participates in carbohydrate biosynthesis and apoptosis regulation. gfpt <dig> is expressed in many tissues including skeletal muscle and heart  <cit> . network connection revealed discreet interaction between gfpt <dig> and apoa <dig> 

low incubation temperature at late treatment  had an impact on multiple degs and pathways in both embryo stages and at d <dig>  however, these transcriptomic changes were not associated with significant phenotypic changes compared to the control . the transcriptional response to lower incubation temperature appears to mediate compensatory effects that indicate a considerable adaptability. in nature transient reduction of incubation temperature during natural brooding happens. accordingly, regulatory mechanism evolved in birds that enable the emergence of normal phenotypes. in contrast, higher incubation temperature triggers gene expression and has long-term effects on the phenotype. elevated temperature is not likely in natural brooding, consequently not compensatory mechanisms evolved. phenotypic changes associated with increased incubation temperature display metabolic plasticity of chicken.

CONCLUSIONS
our experiment shows that manipulation of incubation temperature immediately effected transcriptomic changes and influenced the long-term expression. in parallel the results on growth, carcass, meat quality and mitochondrial respiratory activities indicate effects of transient variation of incubation temperature as well  <cit> . the observations indicate the successful activation of compensatory mechanisms in adaptation to lowered temperature and phenotypic plasticity in response to elevated temperature. further investigations of the mechanism behind these regulatory processes including epigenetic modifications provide the perspective to improve resistance to environmental changes without much effect on growth performance  <cit> . moreover, numerous genes which play important roles in metabolic pathways and which showed changed expression due to shifted incubation temperature represent candidate genes for further genetic improvement in terms of resilience against temperature shifts or in terms of increased muscle growth without affecting meat quality.
