BACKGROUND
diverse cellular responses to tgfβ superfamily members are a hallmark of this family, with responses specified by cell type, time, or location within a tgfβ member gradient  <cit> . in c. elegans, a bmp-like family member, dbl- <dig> , regulates not only body size, but also innate immunity and aspects of male tail development. animals with reduced pathway signaling are small, while increased signaling results in long animals  <cit> . animals with defective dbl- <dig> are also more susceptible to bacterial or fungal infection, and dbl- <dig> is highly up-regulated upon infection  <cit> .

body size and male tail development are separable by dose, as a weak sma- <dig> receptor mutant or a weak sma-4/smad mutant affects body size but not male tails  <cit> . furthermore, tgfβ pathway regulators also differentiate between body size and male tail development. for instance, sma-11/kin- <dig>  bra- <dig>  and lon-2/glypican affect body size but not male tails. mab-23/doublesex transcription factor, on the other hand, affects dbl- <dig> male tail development independently of body size  <cit> . the lin- <dig> forkhead transcription factor may also play a role in dbl- <dig> mediated male tail development. lin- <dig> mutant males have crumpled spicules similar to dbl- <dig> mutant males, and forkhead transcription factors are known to be smad co-factors  <cit> .

how is specificity achieved? we performed a microarray experiment comparing populations of mrnas from animals with increased or decreased dbl-1/bmp signaling. we discovered that transcriptional control of body size in c. elegans acts through the regulation of metabolism, protein synthesis/degradation, and structural genes, and not obviously by cell cycle genes. furthermore, we have identified a subset of the hedgehog-related genes  as targets of the dbl- <dig> pathway, and propose that they act as downstream transducers of dbl- <dig> signaling for body size determination. in addition, we now better understand the role that dbl- <dig> plays in innate immunity, as our results show that genes known to be involved in innate immunity, namely lysozymes, lipase, and lectins, are regulated by the dbl- <dig> signaling pathway. a large number of other intestinally expressed genes, a primary site of innate immunity, are also highly regulated by dbl- <dig>  suggesting a broader role for dbl- <dig> in the intestinal innate immune response. finally, we created a fluorescent biomarker for dbl- <dig> activity, and showed that the reporter accurately identified known dbl- <dig> signaling components.

RESULTS
microarray hybridization and analyses of gene expression profiles
we compared gene expression in c. elegans strain bw <dig> overexpressing ctis <dig>  an integrated transgene carrying wild-type dbl- <dig>  and a strain lacking functional dbl- <dig> type i receptor, lt <dig> sma- <dig>  <cit> . sma- <dig>  which encodes a stop codon at y <dig> predicted to truncate the protein prematurely in its extracellular domain, has reduced sma- <dig> rna expression levels  <cit> . bw <dig> animals are longer than the wild type, and lt <dig> animals are smaller than normal. these strains have not been tested for response to an immune challenge, however dbl- <dig> animals are more susceptible to infection by pathogenic bacteria  <cit> .

we performed our microarray analyses with the affymetrix c. elegans whole genome genechip array, which represents over  <dig>  unique transcripts . five independent experiments were averaged and analyzed. about  <dig> genes show a change in expression at the 95% confidence level , with about  <dig> transcripts showing up-regulation of transcription in response to bmp signaling  and about  <dig> showing a down-regulation of transcription .  <dig> genes are regulated within a  <dig> % confidence interval, with  <dig> positively regulated and  <dig> negatively regulated genes . none of the genes in the  <dig> % confidence interval show a change in expression less than  <dig> -fold .

from our microarray results, we find that bw <dig> ctis <dig> )has about twice the amount of dbl- <dig> transcript as lt <dig> sma- <dig>  which is consistent with it being overexpressed . to validate the results of the microarray experiment, we performed qpcr on  <dig> genes that were highly up-regulated or down-regulated in our microarray analyses. we compared the ratio of expression of the two experimental genotypes in the qpcr and the microarray experiments to determine if the difference in levels showed the same trend. all but two samples showed the same trend .

the numeric values shown under each genotype tested represent the relative difference of bw <dig> to lt <dig>  with each value normalized to an internal standard. a value of  <dig> represents identical expression to the standard.

regulation of body size genes
how cell and organismal size is controlled is an old question that has been studied at the molecular level in yeast and only sporadically in multicellular organisms  <cit> . body size is defined at the cellular level by cell number  and cell size  <cit> . besides environmental factors and hormones, tgfβ superfamily signaling pathways have also been clearly implicated in controlling cell and body size in c. elegans, d. melanogaster  <cit> , and in vertebrates  <cit> . furthermore, because of tgfβ superfamily pathways' roles in cell growth and proliferation, they are commonly associated with uncontrolled cell growth in cancers  <cit> .

this study addresses the mechanisms by which body size is executed in a multicellular organism. c. elegans is the only model multicellular organism where the cell number is defined:  <dig> somatic cells in adult hermaphrodites and  <dig> somatic cells in adult males  <cit> . by removing the cell number variable, our results focus on how cell size differences are achieved through our bmp-like signaling pathway.

metabolic genes were enriched in our panel of highly up-regulated genes, including energy generation, protein expression, nucleotide synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis . additionally, we observed a small but consistent up-regulation of ribosomal proteins. ribosomal proteins have been shown experimentally to be important for cell size regulation in yeast  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and arabidopsis  <cit> . protein synthesis and degradation genes were also enriched , including ubiquitinylation pathway proteins, suggesting that not only are increased amounts of protein required in the longer animal, but also increased protein turnover machinery.

specific functional groups were found to be over-represented in our  <dig> % significant group using stanford microarray database web tools  <cit> . a representation factor of  <dig>  would be expected in a randomly generated list of genes. higher values show enrichment for genes in that functional group. p values represent the likelihood of achieving that enrichment by chance. mount  <dig> contains germline enriched, oocyte, mitosis, and meiosis genes, mount  <dig> contains intestinal genes, proteases, carboxylesterases, lipases, and antibacterial proteins. mount  <dig> contains germline enriched, oocyte, meiosis, mitosis, retinoblastoma enriched complex. mount  <dig> contains germline enriched, biosynthesis, protein expression, and heat shock genes. mount  <dig> contains protein expression and energy generation genes. mount  <dig> contains amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation genes. mount  <dig> contains amino acid metabolism and energy generation genes. mount  <dig> contains protein expression genes, and mount  <dig> is not characterized. in addition to mountains, gene expression is also clustered by biofunctional groups. number of genes in the group represent the number of genes from several experiments that show coregulation of expression for a particular mountain  <cit> .

structural genes are also up-regulated by dbl- <dig> signaling . many non-dauer specific collagens and other extracellular matrix genes have increased gene expression at the 95th percentile with increased dbl- <dig> signaling. intracellular structural genes, like actins, myosins, and tubulins also show positive changes. however, whether these drive body size changes or are a response to the need for more structural proteins by larger cells remains uncertain.

germline genes comprise the largest category of genes down-regulated by dbl- <dig> signaling in our data set. these categories include mitotic and meiotic genes as well as dna repair genes and oocyte specific genes . recently, the dbl- <dig> signaling pathway was shown to negatively regulate reproductive aging  <cit> . pathway mutants appear to extend the reproductive span of older hermaphrodites by improving oocyte quality, not by affecting ovulation rate, early progeny number, or brood size. the model proposed is that dbl- <dig> normally modulates reproductive rates in response to environmental stress, and that loss of dbl- <dig> constitutively extends reproductive aging. somatic life span was largely independent from germline health span. our results indicate that the mechanism by which this phenomenon acts is through transcriptional regulation of germline-specific genes. we tested if altered regulation of germline genes affected brood size. to test this idea, we picked single l <dig> animals to plates and allowed them to lay eggs. the parental hermaphrodites were transferred and the eggs were counted every eight hours until no more eggs were laid. dbl- <dig> overexpressing animals  had an identical brood size  to wild type. sma- <dig> animals show a significantly smaller brood size , averaging only about  <dig> eggs. this brood size is similar to those of other mutant strains that have loss of dbl- <dig> pathway gene function  <cit> . furthermore, eggs and embryos from mutants in the dbl- <dig> pathway are of normal size and the gonad from dbl- <dig> overexpressing animals is not proportionally bigger . our results suggest that increased dbl- <dig> pathway signaling does not greatly affect the germline but loss of signaling does, by increasing expression of normally repressed germline-specific genes.

cell cycle genes appear to be largely unaffected at the transcriptional level by dbl- <dig> signaling at the l <dig> stage. other tgfβ superfamily members have been implicated in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation, not only during development and homeostasis, but also during cancer progression  <cit> . in c. elegans, body size is dissociated from cell proliferation and number; however it is associated with endoreduplication in the polyploid hypodermal cells. long animals with increased dbl- <dig> signaling have increased ploidy in hypodermal cells, and small animals with decreased dbl- <dig> signaling have reduced ploidy at later stages  <cit> . this indicates that some cell cycle genes are regulated by dbl- <dig>  perhaps post-transcriptionally or at a level that does not reach significance in our analyses. further, cell cycle genes may be altered at later stages of development. dbl- <dig> signaling does not affect the organism's maturation time or number of somatic cells, but pathway mutants do have reduced brood sizes, as indicated above. this could be an indication of cell cycle regulation in the adult gonad  <cit> .

another similar but distinct published analysis has produced overlapping results. mochii et al.  screened an arrayed filter of c. elegans cdnas  for differences in regulation between dbl- <dig>  sma- <dig>  lon- <dig>  and wild-type populations of third larval-stage animals  <cit> . their results showed  <dig> genes  that were both highly down-regulated in dbl- <dig> and sma- <dig> animals and significantly up-regulated in lon- <dig> animals. of those  <dig> genes, we find  <dig> are also highly regulated in our screen . included in this subset are the dbl- <dig> receptor gene, sma- <dig>  and lon- <dig>  a downstream transcriptional target of dbl- <dig> signaling  <cit> . our microarray data for lon- <dig> indicates there may be regulation, similar to what was previously reported, but variation between the data sets puts this result below the 95% confidence. in our previous study of lon- <dig>  we reported a difference in expression of lon- <dig> protein between lon- <dig> and sma- <dig> of about 30%  <cit> . this level of change would not be detected with confidence in a microarray experiment.

taken together these results suggest that the ultimate effects of dbl- <dig> signaling on body size in c. elegans may be accomplished through changes in regulating a broad range of genes involved in metabolism and structure.

hedgehog superfamily signaling is a downstream regulator of dbl- <dig> signaling
we identified three hypodermal wrt genes and patched receptor genes in our array. wrt- <dig> and wrt- <dig> were significantly up-regulated, 10-fold and 8-fold respectively. wrt- <dig> was up-regulated but just below statistical significance in our experiments, but was up-regulated significantly in liang et al , using a different set of tgfβ transducers  <cit> . nematodes do not have hedgehog genes, but bioinformatic analysis shows there are several genes that have a conserved hint domain  but a different n-terminal ligand domain . these genes are called warthog to show their relationship to hedgehog  <cit> . the three warthog genes that are regulated by dbl- <dig> are exclusively expressed in the hypodermis  <cit> . all three warthog genes are related to each other in both the wart and hint domains, with wrt- <dig> and wrt- <dig> being most similar to each other .

we obtained gene knockouts from the nematode genome consortium  for the three wrt genes in order to test the hypothesis that they affect body size. we made and measured double and triple mutant combinations of animals. measurements of the wrt mutants singly and in combination with each other show that they are smaller than wild-type animals . the double and triple mutant combinations of these three genes do not show a further reduction of body size, suggesting that all three operate in the same pathway. the partial reduction in size observed with the triple mutant, compared to loss of dbl- <dig> pathway function, could be explained by the existence of several other warthog genes that show low levels of expression in the hypodermis  <cit> . a sma body size for the wrt genes has also been reported in rnai experiments  <cit> . additional evidence that these genes are linked to body size comes from our injection experiments. overexpression of wrt- <dig> is mostly lethal, but animals that escaped this terminal phenotype are sma. likewise, a partial genomic fragment of wrt- <dig> fused to gfp is also mostly lethal, with escapers presenting a sma phenotype. a genomic wrt-8:gfp fusion  was injected and the resulting transgenic animals are sma. these overexpression phenotypes suggest that proper levels of wrt- <dig> and wrt- <dig> are required for normal body size morphology.

body size measurements of single, double, and triple mutant combinations. n represents number of animals measured  <dig> hours after the l <dig> stage. the p-value is the probability that the tested strain length is the same as the wild type.

liang et al  compared expression patterns between dbl- <dig>  sma- <dig>  and wild-type animals  <cit> . sma- <dig> encodes a predicted co-transcription factor for the dbl- <dig> pathway smads  <cit> . they found  <dig> genes are commonly regulated by sma- <dig> and dbl- <dig>  only one, wrt- <dig>  is down-regulated in both dbl- <dig> and sma- <dig> microarrays relative to the wild type. this supports our microarray results showing significant up-regulation of wrt- <dig> when dbl- <dig> is overexpressed.

while dbl- <dig> affects the body size of animals living in reproductively favorable conditions, c. elegans has another bmp superfamily member, daf- <dig>  that regulates an alternative life stage called dauer, a facultative diapause that animals enter in response to harsh environmental conditions  <cit> . dbl- <dig> and daf- <dig> use the same type ii receptor, daf- <dig>  we reasoned that dbl- <dig> and daf- <dig> might use similar but distinct mechanisms or signaling pathways to regulate their distinct effects. to address this, we compared our results to those from a microarray experiment that compared non-dauer larvae at around the l <dig> molt to same stage  animals entering dauer due to loss of function of daf- <dig> or the daf- <dig> smads daf- <dig> and daf- <dig>  <cit> . the dauer analysis showed that dbl- <dig> is down-regulated in dauering animals, and also identifies several genes related to hedgehog  by a common hog domain, as well as patched  genes. consistent with the down-regulation of dbl- <dig> in animals entering dauer, they also found that wrt- <dig> and wrt- <dig> were also down-regulated. seven patched genes were also significantly down-regulated in the dauer study, while we found another, ptr- <dig>  to be  <dig> -fold  up-regulated. this indicates that dbl- <dig> and daf- <dig> are using similar mechanisms  to regulate distinct biological outcomes.

regulation of male spicule development
because we used a hermaphrodite population in our studies, we expected to exclude most genes highly regulated by dbl- <dig> during male tail development. that is largely the case, since most are expressed male-specifically. one that was identified, lin- <dig>  also has roles in hermaphrodite development  <cit> . lin- <dig> is a forkhead transcription factor, which in other systems is a smad co-factor  <cit> . lin- <dig> is implicated in dbl-1-mediated male tail development, as lin- <dig> mutant males have crumpled spicules like those exhibited by dbl- <dig> pathway mutant males  <cit> . we show a transcriptional effect of dbl- <dig> on lin- <dig>  as it is  <dig> -fold  up-regulated by pathway signaling. this indirectly supports the hypothesis that dbl- <dig> acts through lin- <dig> in affecting spicule development.

regulation of immunity
tgfβ superfamily members play a role in immune responses in mammals  <cit> . dbl- <dig> is up-regulated in microarrays analyzing c. elegans innate immunity, and dbl- <dig> animals succumb sooner than the wild type to infection by pathogenic bacteria and yeast  <cit> . while the dbl- <dig> pathway is required solely in the hypodermis for its body size role, all receptors and smads are more strongly expressed in the intestine and/or pharynx, primary sites for the c. elegans immune response  <cit> . a plausible explanation for dbl- <dig> pathway expression in the intestine is that it transcriptionally regulates genes required for an immune response. in our microarray study, animal populations were bleached to not only stage them but also to control for possible contamination responses unrelated to genotype. we identified several families of genes known to be involved in the immune response, including lysozymes, lectins, and lipase, as well as npr- <dig>   <cit> . other genes with intestinal expression are also enriched .

when we compared our results to data obtained from two other microarray analyses analyzing immune response to pathogenic bacterial infection, we identified a remarkable overlap between their highly regulated genes and a subset of ours  <cit> . mallo et al. analyzed the c. elegans transcriptional response to s. marcescens infection  <cit> . they identified seven genes with an induction of greater than 2-fold, including a lipase, lectins, and lysozymes, which are involved in immune responses in other animals  <cit> . of those seven, three were identified in our screen as highly up-regulated . they also found that all of the lysozyme genes they tested  were induced in infected animals by microarray and by northern analyses. we found that these three lys genes were also highly up-regulated in our microarray, as were lys- <dig> and lys- <dig>  which were not represented by cdnas in the previous study. wong et al. also identified lipase, lectin, and lysozyme gene up-regulation when they compared animals fed on standard op <dig> e. coli to pathogenic e. caratovora, e. faecalis, and p. luminescens-fed animals  <cit> . they also identified aspartyl proteases and saposin as highly up-regulated. these were identified in our analysis as highly up-regulated . a directed analysis of immune response in c. elegans by alper et al. demonstrated dbl- <dig> regulation of lys- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> as well as the lectin clec- <dig>  <cit> .

development of a dbl- <dig> pathway fluorescent reporter
to create a reporter for dbl- <dig> signaling, we tested six of the highest regulated genes for efficacy as a reporter for the sma/mab pathway . we drove green fluorescent protein  expression from these genes' promoters and compared gfp expression levels in wild-type and sma- <dig> animals. we showed that the promoter for an immune-response gene, spp-9/saposin  showed the greatest difference in response to altered dbl- <dig> pathway levels   <cit> . gfp from the spp- <dig> promoter is weakly expressed in the intestine of wild-type, op50-fed animals . however, in the sma- <dig> background, this promoter is up-regulated, as seen by increased intestinal fluorescence . this marker exhibited no change when placed in the background of collagen mutants, which affect body size independently of dbl- <dig> . there are a number of putative smad binding sites in the promoter region of spp- <dig>  which suggests it may be a direct target, but binding to these sites has not been validated. this strain helps validate our mutants identified from genetic screens, but also provides a screenable marker for future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show how dbl- <dig> pathway signaling in the hypodermis leads to body size changes by regulating transcription of genes involved in metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation, but not significantly by cell cycle genes. we identified a proposed downstream signal transduction pathway in the hh-related wrt signaling pathway, which may relay the dbl- <dig> pathway signal out of the hypodermis to neighboring cells to regulate body size. we have discovered a mechanism for dbl- <dig> in the intestinal innate immune response: to promote transcription of many genes directly involved in immunity. a fluorescent biomarker for dbl- <dig> pathway signaling was generated and will provide the basis for future studies of how dbl- <dig> signaling is regulated.
