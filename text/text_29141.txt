BACKGROUND
phyto-oxylipins, which are among the important active components of plant cells, play diverse roles in several physiological events including plant growth and development, senescence, and defence against pathogens and pests as well as abiotic sources of stress  <cit> . most phyto-oxylipins are derived from the lipoxygenase  pathway, which contains at least seven multi-enzyme branches. of these enzymes, lipoxygenase is the first step and a key enzyme. plant lox  is a large family of non-heme iron-containing enzymes that catalyse the addition of molecular oxygen to linoleic acid  and linolenic acid  at either c <dig> or c <dig> position, with 9s- or 13s-hydroperoxides as the primary product, and hence are referred to as 9- or 13-lox  <cit> . plant loxs can be further divided into two gene subfamilies, type  <dig> and type  <dig>  based on the n-terminal chloroplast transit peptide sequence. the type  <dig> subfamily lacks a plasmid transit peptide and consists of both 9- and 13-loxs, and the type  <dig> subfamily possesses 13-loxs, which have a chloroplast transit peptide  <cit> . both 9s- and 13s-hydroperoxides are rapidly converted into a series of biologically active molecules by the action of the lox pathway enzymes, and are therefore referred to as phyto-oxylipins  <cit> .

the highest lox activity was observed in soybean during leaf growth  <cit> , and lox activity level was reported as being positively correlated with the rate of elongation of an organ  <cit> . potato lox <dig> is expressed during tuber growth, and its antisense suppression resulted in smaller tubers  <cit> . maize lox <dig>  knockout mutants showed shorter roots and increased senescence  <cit> . the olive 9/13-lox gene is predominantly expressed during fruit ripening and is believed to be associated with senescence in the plant  <cit> . a similar observation was made in kiwifruit loxs  <cit> . some loxs, such as r9-lox <dig> and oslox <dig> in rice  <cit>  and pdlox in almond  <cit> , were found to be involved in germination. however, there is little information on the role of loxs in flower bud opening and petal expansion. physiological and biochemical analyses show that lipid content changes and the cellular membrane is degraded during flower senescence  <cit>  and that lipid oxidation is either due to increased lox activity or independent of lox  <cit> . increased lox activity prior to obvious senescence of flowers has been shown in many plants including carnation  <cit> , day lily  <cit> , and rose  <cit> . in petunia inflata, a highly up-regulated allene oxide synthase  gene involved in petal senescence was identified and assumed to have a role in programmed cell death  <cit>  whereas in alstroemeria peruviana and two orchid species, no increase in lox-specific activity was observed over time  <cit> . it is likely that the function of loxs during petal senescence varies from species to species  <cit>  and needs further study.

the expression lox genes is most frequently observed in the response of plants to pest attack, particularly that of many annual herbaceous plants to insects  <cit> . transcripts encoding lox genes were strongly induced during plant-aphid interactions including myzus euphorbiase feeding on tomato leaves  <cit>  and m. nicotianae sucking the sap from nicotiana attenuata  <cit> . the cabbage bolox was up-regulated by several herbivores such as caterpillars , spider mites , and locusts  but not by aphids   <cit> . in rice, two lox genes are involved in the plant's response to stress brought about by herbivores: the oslox <dig> transcript was rapidly and abundantly induced by the brown planthopper  niaparvata lugens  <cit> , and the oshi-lox, which was expressed only slightly by bph but strongly by a chewing insect, namely the striped stem borer  chilo suppressalis  <cit> . the antisense-mediated depletion of lox gene suggests that its role in plant defence varies with the type of herbivore. silencing the nalox <dig> made n. attenuata unable to produce defensive compounds and hence more susceptible to the chewing insect manduca sexta  <cit> ; however, in the field the transformed plants are susceptible to many herbivores, including a new opportunistic phloem-feeder, the leafhopper empoasca sp., which does not select the wild-type n. attenuata  <cit> . transgenic rice with sense or antisense oslox <dig> would increase or decrease the resistance to bph  <cit> . it is noteworthy that antisense expression of rice oshi-lox encourages chewing herbivores but deters the phloem-feeder  <cit> . lox genes are less commonly observed in woody perennials than in herbaceous annuals. the tea plant, being a perennial, is exposed to pests for longer time and being larger, presents a greater expanse for pests -- a study of expression patterns of its lox genes in response to attack by herbivores therefore assumes importance.

the tea plant, camellia sinensis  o. kuntze, is not only one of the world's most important woody plantation crops but is also valued as a source of secondary metabolic products including phyto-oxylipins. tender tea buds and leaves are usually plucked and processed to produce high-grade tea as a beverage. tea flowers emit plenty of aromatic volatiles to attract bees and wasps and have become a major source of honey  <cit> . however, tea is also attacked by herbivores such as tea green leafhoppers and aphids. as a defence mechanism, tea can emit specific volatile organic compounds  or change the relative proportions of many components of the vocs, which may attract predators and parasites - natural enemies of the herbivores - to keep the pests in check  <cit> . as the first step to elucidating the function of tea plant oxylipins in development and defence, we worked on isolating and characterizing a tea plant lox gene, namely cslox <dig>  purification and biochemical analysis of the recombinant protein showed that cslox <dig> is a dual position-specific lipoxygenase producing both c- <dig> and c- <dig> hpos. the cslox <dig> was expressed predominantly in flowers, but differentially regulated during flower opening and senescence. we also studied the dynamics of cslox <dig> expression patterns in leaves following mechanical wounding, hormone treatment, and attack by two phloem-feeders  and the role of cslox <dig> in flower development and defence against insect attack.

RESULTS
isolation and sequence analysis of cslox1
to clone the c. sinensis lipoxygenase gene, three pcr fragments were first amplified by rt-pcr reaction using degenerate primers that correspond to the conserved amino acid sequences from other plant loxs. the resulting segments were  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp long, and their sequences showed a high degree of identity to lipoxygenase from other plants. the cdna ends were then amplified with 5' and 3' race-pcr. finally, the cdna sequences were combined and validated by pcr amplification with the primers derived from 5' and 3' race products. as this is the first lipoxygenase gene reported in the tea plant, the gene was named cslox <dig> . the gene was approximately  <dig> bp long, comprising a  <dig> bp long 5'-untranslated region  and a  <dig> bp long 3'-utr with poly  signals, and contained an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp encoding a presumed translation product of  <dig> amino acids with an mr of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . based on the blast p network service, the predicted amino acid sequence of cslox <dig> showed a high degree of identity with other plant loxs such as common olive , almond , potato , and hazelnut , which belong to type  <dig>  but the gene also shared its identity to a small extent with lox isoforms from the type  <dig> group. sequence analysis of cslox <dig> showed several functional domains typical of plant loxs:  the conserved domains involved in substrate binding  and oxygen binding ,  the highly conserved c-terminal amino acid sequence ,  the plant loxs position specificity motif for 9-lox  ,  five highly conserved histidine residues, one each at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and  amino acid residues essential for the ability to bind iron  at the active site .

the phylogenetic relationships among the deduced amino acid sequences of cslox <dig> and those of other reported plant loxs were determined by constructing a phylogenetic tree . neighbour-joining analysis identified two groups of plant lox proteins that appeared to reflect accurately their subcellular localization. loxs were classified as follows: group i was found in the chloroplast with chloroplast transit peptides at the n-terminal and belonged to type  <dig> subfamily, and group ii was found in the cytoplasm and belonged to type  <dig> subfamily. cslox <dig> belongs to group ii, type  <dig> gene family, and is predicted to be in the cytoplasm. other loxs from group ii, such as zmlox <dig>  <cit> , oslox <dig>  <cit> , and pdlox  <cit> , are reported as being involved in the defence mechanism, whereas olive lox is reported to be involved in fruit ripening and senescence  <cit> .

biochemical activity and characterization of recombinant yeast cslox1
the orf of cslox <dig> was cloned to multiple cloning sites of the expression vector ppic9k, and a recombinant plasmid, namely ppic9k/lox <dig>  was constructed. the linearized plasmid ppic9k/lox <dig> was then transformed to pichia pastoris gs <dig> and over-expressed. the cslox <dig> protein with biochemical activity was synthesized and secreted to the culture medium when a recombinant yeast strain was induced by  <dig> % methanol. the recombinant lipoxygenase encoded by cslox <dig> was purified and characterized. the molecular mass of recombinant cslox <dig> was represented by a unique band of expected size  in coomassie brilliant blue stained sds-page whereas no such similar band was seen in induced control strains harbouring the empty vector .

biochemical activity of the purified recombinant cslox <dig> was investigated by measuring the increase in a <dig> using linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids as substrates. the optimum ph was determined by varying the ph values of the reaction buffers from  <dig>  to  <dig> . at 25°c, the optimum ph turned out to be  <dig>   since cslox <dig> showed the highest activity  at that ph. the enzyme activity was also fairly high  at the ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  . however, the activity dropped to  <dig>  units/mg protein and  <dig>  units/mg protein with linolenic and arachidonic acids as substrates, respectively.

the kinetic parameters were analysed using linoleic and linolenic acids as substrates . the recombinant cslox <dig> showed  <dig> -fold higher km value for linoleic acid  than for linolenic acid . comparison of the vmax values showed that cslox <dig> oxidized linoleic acid approximately  <dig> times faster than linolenic acid did. the kcat/km values of recombinant cslox <dig> for linoleic acid and linolenic acid hydroperoxidation were  <dig>  and  <dig>  s- <dig> μm- <dig>  respectively. these results indicate that linoleic acid is clearly the preferred substrate for the recombinant cslox <dig> 

in order to study the position-specificity of recombinant cslox <dig>  we separated the reaction products by sp-hplc. the retention times of cslox <dig> products were consistent with authentic standards of both 9- and 13-hpod and those of soybean lox <dig> . cslox <dig> produced both 9-hpod and 13-hpod in equal proportion in the reaction mixture . this observation is inconsistent with the positional specificity rule of plant loxs, namely that r/tv motif at the active site indicated the 9-lox  <cit> . although r/tv motif was found at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the cslox <dig> products contained 9-hpod as well as 13-hpod. in this study, it was evident that cslox <dig> was a dual-position-specific lipoxygenase and was accordingly named tea plant 9/13-cslox <dig>  the stereochemistry of the reaction products was analysed by chiral-phase hplc. 9-hpod and 13-hpod were predominantly in the s configuration, indicating that they had been derived from the activity of a specific enzyme .

expression of cslox <dig> in different tissues
to study the tissue specificity of cslox <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr was used for examining its expression pattern in the root, stem, leaf, flower , and seed. transcript abundance of cslox <dig> was the highest in flower and the lowest in the rest . petals showed the highest transcript levels, about 940-fold higher than those in leaves. a similar expression pattern in floral tissues has been reported in pea lox  <cit> , peanut pnlox <dig>  <cit> , and rose rlox <dig>  <cit> . in rose, the transcript of the rlox <dig> gene was dramatically increased in response to senescence of petals, and the gene was held to play a role in promoting petal senescence  <cit> .

total lox activity during flower bud opening and senescence
since earlier reports suggest that loxs are involved in regulating plant growth and development  <cit> , we analysed total lox activity in vitro during flower bud opening and senescence in eight stages, which were designated as follows : s <dig>  buds maturing but yet green; s <dig>  buds slightly white, closed, and with firm tips; s <dig>  buds white, expanded, with soft tips but not yet open; s <dig>  half-opened flowers; s <dig>  just opened flowers, fully open with petals perfectly horizontal; s <dig>  fully open flowers  <dig> h after s4; s <dig>  fully open flowers about  <dig> h after s <dig> with petals showing initial signs of senescence; s <dig>  fully open flowers about  <dig> h after s <dig> with clearly rolled-in petals and separated from the plant together with stamens.

the total lox activity during opening and senescence had at least two clearly different phases, the decreasing phase and the increasing phases . in the first phase, when the buds were opening, total lox activity declined by about 80% from s <dig> to s3; in the second phase, the activity increased slowly from s <dig> to s <dig> and then more rapidly to s <dig> and was about 8-fold higher than that in s <dig>  during this process, the flower opened fully and then senesced gradually; total lox activity began to increase even before the petals had fully expanded. lox activity also increased slightly from s <dig> to s <dig>  when the bud was developing. taken together, the lox activity was relatively high when floral buds were tightly closed, which may indicate that they were in the process of development, declined to the lowest level during flower opening, and began to increase again, peaking at senescence. in a. peruviana too, total lox activity declined when the buds were opening  <cit>  but differed from the present case in that it continued to decline right up to senescence when the perianth abscised. in this study, lox activity during flower senescence was similar to that in day lily petals in that the activity began to increase even before flower opening and then increased more rapidly during petal senescence  <cit> .

expression analysis of cslox <dig> in flower bud opening and senescence
to find out whether the cslox <dig> gene is involved in tea flower opening and senescence, real-time quantitative rt-pcr was carried out. transcript analysis of cslox <dig> during flower bud opening showed that gene expression decreased after s <dig> and remained low until s <dig>  during which the petals opened fully .

transcripts of the cslox <dig> gene increased dramatically in tea petals from s <dig> to s <dig> and from s <dig> to s <dig>  when the petals reached senescence and withered . in other words, the gene was down-regulated during petal opening and up-regulated after the petals had opened fully, especially during petal senescence. the pattern of expression of the cslox <dig> gene during flower bud opening and senescence was similar to that of total lox activity observed during the same stages. the cslox <dig> gene expression level during s <dig> was only  <dig> % of that during s <dig> but the total lox activity during s <dig> was approximately  <dig> % of that during s <dig> and therefore of comparable magnitude. as the tea plant had at least four lox genes , it is likely that total lox activity during s <dig> involved other lipoxygenase isoforms as well in flower development, whereas the cslox <dig> gene is expressed during development as well as during senescence and plays a preeminent role in senescence.

effect of meja, sa, and mechanical damage on cslox <dig> transcription
in leaves, exogenous meja induced the expression of the cslox <dig> gene . maximum expression of cslox <dig> after the meja treatment was at  <dig> h and decreased thereafter, although it remained higher than that in the control at  <dig> h. unlike meja, exogenous sa did not increase cslox <dig> mrna accumulation but suppressed it slightly . transcripts of cslox <dig> accumulated rapidly to reach a high level  <dig> h after mechanical damage but decreased at  <dig> h and  <dig> h following the injury--only to increase again at  <dig> h to reach an even higher level at  <dig> h . thus cslox <dig> appears to be up-regulated by wounding and meja but not by sa.

expression analysis of cslox <dig> in response to phloem feeders
to explore the role of cslox <dig> in mitigating the stress occasioned by herbivores, two different phloem feeders, namely the tea green leafhopper and the tea aphid, were placed on tea leaves.

in leaves eaten by leafhoppers, cslox <dig> transcripts increased rapidly to the highest level   <dig>  h after exposure to the pest but declined to about 60% of that in the highest level at  <dig> h; after  <dig> h, the level increased again until  <dig> h and declined thereafter to 70% of the highest level at  <dig> h, but still remained higher than control .

in the case of the tea aphid, cslox <dig> transcript pattern fell into three phases : in the first phase, the expression increased and the gene was up-regulated within the first  <dig> h, similar to the results of mechanical wounding and the meja treatment; in the second phase, the expression declined sharply and the gene was down-regulated at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, suggesting that the aphids had suppressed gene expression at that phase; in the third phase,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after the treatment, the gene was up-regulated again and the expression increased to its highest level. triggering of the transcription and a rapid increase in its expression level were the most frequently observed responses to insect attack  <cit> , a pattern consistent with that observed by earlier workers, namely that some loxs, together with other defence-related genes, decrease their expression during infection  <cit> .

analysis of lox-derived volatiles from intact leaves and from those damaged by different insects
to ascertain the possible involvement of cslox <dig> in the synthesis and emission of green-leaf volatiles in the tea plant as a defensive response to attack by insects, the profiles of lox-derived volatile compounds obtained from intact plants and from those damaged by the tea green leafhopper and the tea aphid were analysed and compared. the lox-derived volatiles consisted of c- <dig> and c- <dig> aldehydes, alcohols, and esters. as shown in figure  <dig>  intact tea plants released nonanal, a c- <dig> aldehyde, but it was not detected in plants attacked by the phloem feeders. on the other hand, the c- <dig> volatiles, namely -hexenol, -hexenal, and -hexenyl acetate, were the main components of the volatiles released by the infested plants.

in the case of the leafhoppers, the infested plants released greater quantities of -hexenol and -hexenal and slightly lower quantities of -hexenyl acetate than the intact plants did. this pattern correlated with the increase in the expression level of cslox <dig> in plants attacked by the leafhoppers .

in the case of the tea aphids, the infested plants released lower quantities of -hexenol and -hexenyl acetate but greater quantities of -hexenal and also released -hexenoic acid. these results suggest that some lox-derived volatiles were suppressed and some others were induced as a result of aphid infestation. the emission of lox-derived volatiles by aphid-infested plants correlated with the expression pattern of cslox <dig> . in addition, the increased levels of -hexenal following aphid infestation were reported to be part of a tritrophic interaction wherein the volatile attracts the predators and parasites of the tea aphid such as leis axyridis, chrysopa septempunctata, and aphidius sp., and thus plays an indirect role in the plant's defence mechanism  <cit> .

discussion
the similarities in amino acid sequences of other plant loxs and those of cslox <dig> were examined to identify the gene. the predicted gene included all the typical plant lox domains but lacked an n-terminal transit peptide. phylogenetic analysis showed that cslox <dig> can be characterized as a type  <dig> lox gene, which is commonly found in the cytoplasm. the gene appears to be closely related to the loxs in olive, almond, potato, and hazelnut, but shares few similarities with type  <dig> loxs, which are known to be located in chloroplasts. after the cslox <dig> gene was introduced into yeast p. pastoris, it was heterologously expressed and its products showed lipoxygenase activity but showed characteristics that differed from those of other plant loxs. generally, plant loxs position-specificity is determined by the primary motifs r/th, r/tf, r/sf, or r/cf for 13-lox and r/tv for 9-lox at the active site  <cit> . the cslox <dig> contained an r/tv motif and was predicted to be 9-lox. surprisingly, as shown by hplc analysis, both 9- and 13- hydroperoxides of linoleic acid, predominantly in the s configuration, were produced in equal proportion by the recombinant cslox <dig>  a feature that did not fit the predictive position-specificity models; similar results were observed in some other plant loxs such as potato stlox- <dig>  <cit> , maize zmlox <dig>  <cit> , hazelnut lox1:ca: <dig>  <cit> , pea loxn <dig>  <cit> , rice oslox <dig>  <cit> , and olive lox  <cit> . these enzymes displayed a dual-positional-specificity and may be named 9/13-loxs. within the 9/13-loxs group, maize zmlox <dig> responded to wounding and meja, but meja induced zmlox <dig> expression exhibiting a biphasic pattern comprising an early phase and a late phase  <cit> ; rice oslox <dig> was induced by wounding and was involved in defence against bph  <cit> ; and olive lox was mainly expressed during late developmental stages, and may be associated with fruit ripening and senescence  <cit> . it was reported that lox specificity has implications for hydroperoxide metabolism, and 9/13-lox products such as 9-and 13-hydroperoxide from linoleic and linolenic acids can be converted into volatile aldehydes by hydroperoxide lyase , whereas 13-hydroperoxide from linolenic acid can be converted into ja cyclic precursors by aos  <cit> . these results suggest that 9/13-cslox <dig> is involved in diverse biological branches of the lox pathway and is able to produce compounds that play important roles in a plant's development and in its defence response  <cit> .

the optimal ph for recombinant cslox <dig> activity was  <dig> , which might be the lowest reported for any plant lox to date, including pea loxn <dig>   <cit> , rice oslox <dig>   <cit> , rose rlox <dig>   <cit> , and carnation soluble lox isoforms   <cit> . the acidic loxs from carnation and rose petals are believed to play an important role in flower senescence by way of membrane disruption by the hpos and free radical action  <cit> . however, in processes other than senescence, especially during flower opening, these potentially harmful components and other reactive oxygen species  should be prevented from acting. total lox activity decreased during the flower opening stage in a. peruviana  <cit> , and endogenous h2o <dig> decreased and the specific activity of protective enzymes increased or remained at a higher level than that at senescence in day lily  <cit> . our results showed that cslox <dig>  together with the flower lox activity, was suppressed during flower bud opening and high levels of it were induced during petal senescence. these results indicate that cslox <dig> is involved in flower development, playing a regulatory role in flower senescence.

analysis of tissue-specific mrna accumulation showed that cslox <dig> levels were the lowest in leaves. cslox <dig> was induced and its transcripts accumulated above the basal level following mechanical wounding or meja treatment, but sa treatment did not induce cslox <dig>  two lox genes in poplars  were also up-regulated by mechanical wounding and exposure to meja, but both were down-regulated by sa. the genes were reported to be involved in defending poplars against the necrotrophic pathogen marssonina brumnea f. sp. multigermtubi  <cit> . also, the rice oshi-lox gene expression levels were induced by mechanical damage and ja treatment but not by sa, and the gene was proved to have a role in herbivore-induced ja biosynthesis  <cit> . cslox <dig>  together with the above genes, seems to be involved in ja-related plant defence and that against attacks by herbivores.

on the basis of lox-derived volatiles, it was inferred that the lox pathway is activated mainly following infestation by the tea green leafhopper whereas in aphid-infested plants, the lox pathway is not only induced inadequately but also positively suppressed. concerning expression of the lox gene in response to attack by the tea green leafhopper and the tea aphid, it appeared that although the gene had different transcript patterns, each had a clear correlation with the emission pattern of lox-derived volatiles. tea green leafhopper is a highly mobile, opportunistic phloem-feeding herbivore, and the gene's response to sucking by the insect is transient and biphasic: the first phase begins within about  <dig>  h after the insect begins feeding, and the highest transcript level is reached during this phase; the second phase begins  <dig> h after the feeding has started, and the expression level continues to be fairly high in this phase. in the case of mechanical wounding, the pattern of expression is similar although the transcript level is lower : cslox <dig> accumulates rapidly at  <dig> h and also has two phases. pea loxn <dig> exhibits similar expression patterns in response to wounding  <cit>  and maize lox <dig>  to exogenous meja treatment  <cit> . these loxs function in different phases of the response to stress and are deployed quickly in response to cell damage due to oxidative burst  <cit> , decline rapidly thereafter, and either remain at the elevated level throughout the defensive response or return to their normal levels in tissue development. oral secretions of the tea aphid are produced over a longer time than those of the leafhopper and the aphid also continues feeding for much longer  <cit> . accordingly, the aphid elicits a multi-stage response, which comprises two up-regulation stages separated by a suppression stage . some aphids strongly induce lox transcripts and elicit ja-mediated resistance  <cit>  but others do not  <cit> . on the other hand, some aphids use a decoy strategy to suppress an effective ja response by inducing sa-dependent defence in a variety of plant species  <cit> . these reports indicated that the role of ja-related loxs in resistance to aphids varies from one plant species to the next. our results showed that meja induction of cslox <dig> gene in the tea plant following aphid attack is more complicated, as revealed by the alternating stages of induction and suppression of the gene. the tea aphid may use its oral secretions while feeding on tea leaves to neutralize some effective defence mechanism involving ja whereas with the tea green leafhopper, the plant has to deal mostly with wounding, and ja-related resistance may prove adequate. these aspects, however, need further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
based on similarities in the sequence of amino acids, we have identified a lox pathway gene, cslox <dig>  the expression level of which in petals was  <dig> times greater than that in leaves. the gene showed opposing regulation patterns during flower development: the expression was down-regulated during flower opening but strongly up-regulated during petal senescence. in leaves, the gene was up-regulated following wounding and meja treatments and was also induced in response to feeding by the tea green leafhopper but suppressed in response to feeding by the tea aphid at some stage of the protracted and complicated interaction between the plant and the aphid. when the cslox <dig> gene was over-expressed in yeast, the purified protein showed unusual catalysis over a broad acidic ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and displayed dual positional specificity with 9/13-lox activity. phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 9/13-lox plays diverse roles in plant development and the plant's defence mechanisms. further investigation aimed at evaluating other loxs or genes downstream of the lox pathway will help in understanding the function of tea plant oxylipins in defence and development.
