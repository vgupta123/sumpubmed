BACKGROUND
the analysis of the overall fatty acid profiles as well as the occurrence of fatty acids  in different lipid classes in microalgae is an emerging field which is expected to reveal the identification of novel fas with a variety of new functional groups  <cit> . despite a number of reports has been carried out and published, describing the contents as well as the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids  in mostly marine microalgae  <cit> , systematic approaches that include different or even many genera of microalgae and particularly those from freshwaters or terrestrial habitats are still missing  <cit> .

based on current knowledge, fa composition divides microalgae roughly into two groups, i.e. on one hand the cyanobacteria and green algae  which contain low amounts of fas, predominantly saturated and mono unsaturated fas as well as trace amounts of pufas, mostly linoleic acid : where x:y is a fatty acid containing x carbons and y double bonds in position z counting from the carboxyl end)). on the other hand chromalveolate algae contain significant amounts of pufas  <cit> .

among the various biochemical markers, fa or lipid profiles represent a chemically relatively inert class of compounds that is easy to isolate from biological material and fa profiles are considered as chemotaxonomic markers to define groups of various taxonomic ranks in flowering plants, trees and other embryophytes  <cit> .

beside the identification of novel fas, some recent studies report on the use of fas and lipid profiles of algae as biomarkers  <cit> . viso et al. determined profiles of fas of nine different marine algal groups and they were able to define even species-specific lipid compositions  <cit> . moreover they found a roughly taxon specific profile when the cells were cultured under identical growth conditions. various strains and species of the cyanobacterium nostoc were screened for their fa content and the application of a fa-based cluster analysis has been described for their identification  <cit> .

fa and lipid composition have also been used as biomarkers to distinguish closely related microalgae at the species and the generic levels  <cit> . hitherto no systematic analysis has been carried out on a large scale basis on either the profiles of lipids or fas in microalgae. therefore, we determined the fa profiles of all available microalgal strains of the sag culture collection of microalgae http://www.epsag.uni-goettingen.de which is one of the most diverse and comprehensive resources of microalgae. at present   <dig> strains of mainly microscopic algae including a considerable variety of cyanobacteria is available. they comprise almost all phyla and classes of eukaryotic algae, but an emphasis is put on algae from freshwaters and terrestrial habitats.

distribution patterns of fas may be valuable also as a proxy to identify certain groups, species and strains of microalgae of particular interest for applied research, i.e. due to the presence of certain fas and/or high percentages of total fa content. we also tested whether the detected fa distribution patterns are meaningful in a phylogenetic context at various taxonomic levels, i.e. to define taxonomic groups of microalgae by their fa patterns. it would assist predicting fa content and/or presence of other valuable compounds if the phylogenetic relationships of algae were reflected in their fa distribution patterns.

here the focus was set on esterified long chain fas , which were analysed via gas chromatography  with or without mass spectrometry . the large number of data obtained, were added into a database to document the fa profiles of the studied microalgal strains.

RESULTS
 <dig>  a database of fa profiles from diverse microalgae
the characterisation of fa profiles of the sag microalgal strains was performed by screening long chain fas  esterified within lipids. a total of  <dig> culture strains from the sag  were screened. a database was established which contained all identified fas and some other hydrophobic metabolites. an overview of all substances identified in the algal strains screened is shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> different substances were identified by mass spectrometry,  <dig> of which represent methyl esters of fas. out of the  <dig> fatty acids,  <dig> substances were identified by their mass spectrum and by retention time according to a standard substance, and the other  <dig> fatty acids were identified by their mass spectra only. the remaining  <dig> substances were identified by their mass spectra only as well. in comparisons with a standard substance, the compound was identified by comparison to mass spectra with highest similarity to the proposed substance in the ms-library . by this some methyl esters of branched fas were detected, for example 12-methyl-14: <dig> or  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  15-tetramethyl-16: <dig>  whereas for most of the fames, authentic standards or ms references were available, for some other substances only "best hit" identification was possible. the dmox derivatives enabled the identification of the remaining  <dig> fames. unidentified substances have yet to be verified with authentic standards, which are not available at this time point. the complete database is shown as additional file  <dig> 

for the marked  fames the double bond positions were only tentatively assigned.

bacteria in algal cultures  are well known and can be found in culture strains of almost any algal culture collection. only a small fraction  of the studied sag strains may be in axenic state. therefore, also the fa content of the contaminating bacteria may have contributed to the obtained fa profile. to test this, we measured methyl-15: <dig> and methyl 17: <dig> that are regarded as markers for bacterial contaminations  <cit> . only  <dig> strains out of the  <dig> analyzed strains contained small amounts methyl-15: <dig>  this observed low rate of contaminating bacteria was supported by microscopic controls which are routine in the perpetual maintenance of algal strains . in summary, we conclude that only 1-2% of the strains may have been contaminated and that there is only a minor influence of bacterial contaminations on the observed algal culture fa profiles.

in addition we compared the measured major fa profiles of  <dig> randomly chosen strains from different classes with published data , and it should be noted that only one out of the  <dig> strains that were chosen from the published data originated from the sag collection. for  <dig> strains the fa profiles were very similar. in case of the  <dig> remaining strains major differences were observed in the degree of desaturation of the fas with different chain lengths, which may be explained by the different cultivation conditions used in the different studies.

 <dig>  patterns of fatty acid composition
fame profiles were rather different among strains. as an example, fame profiles from four different genera, i.e. chroococcus , closteriopsis , pseudochantransia  and prymnesium  are presented in figure  <dig>  therefore it was anticipated to recover certain different fa distribution patterns between phyla, classes and genera of microalgae. in addition, it was tested whether differences in fa patterns can also be found for groups at lower taxonomic rank, i.e. between species of the same genus or even among multiples isolates of the same species.

 <dig>  distribution of four important pufas among strains of the sag algal culture collection
the distribution patterns of fas among and within the  <dig> groups  of microalgae and the cyanobacteria comprised by the examined strains was investigated in more detail for four pufas which are of high nutritional interest . the frequency of occurrence of these four pufas in a certain group of microalgae is given as the percentage of strains with a certain fa from all examined strains in table  <dig> 

the frequency of pufas is shown as the percentage of the total number of strains examined per group.

because the sag culture collection focuses on microscopic algae from terrestrial habitats, the haptophyta, dinophyta and phaeophyceae were just poorly represented. therefore, the recovered distribution patterns in these and other poorly represented groups may not be representative for the whole group. for instance, for phaeophyceae mainly microscopic forms  were available and the examined rhodophyta strains covered mostly freshwater forms or those from terrestrial habitats . although diatoms are very diverse in terrestrial habitats, the examined small sample of available diatom strains  does by far not adequately represent this group which is probably the most species-rich algal group. also, for each of the two classes of stramenopiles , phaeothamniophyceae and raphidophyceae, just two strains are maintained at the sag and, therefore, are not further discussed here. similarly, there is only a single strain of chlorarachniophyta  in the sag.

the very long chain pufa docosahexaenoic acid ) was the third most frequent fa, present in  <dig> out of  <dig> examined groups . in the dinophyta, haptophyta and euglenoids dha-containing strains were particularly frequent and dha was found there in relatively high percentages of total fa content, i.e. in 60% or more of these strains the dha proportion was higher than 5%. in the single studied dinophyte strain of ceratium horridum the dha proportion was even  <dig> %. in the other groups dha was found in rather low frequencies and also mostly in rather small proportions, i.e. less than 1% of total fa content. although dha was found in the cryptophyta and bacillariophyceae in about every fifth strain, its percentage of total fa content was less than 5% there, except in cryptomonas baltica sag  <dig>   where it is was  <dig> %. despite dha was found in rather low frequencies in the green algae , the second highest dha content of all sag strains,  <dig> % of total fa, was found in the chlorophyte chlorococcum novae-angliae sag  <dig> , followed by the trebouxiophyte prototheca zopfii sag 263- <dig> with  <dig> %. together these findings are in accordance with dha amounts described before for specific groups of alga  <cit> .

eicosapentaenoic acid ) was one of the most common pufas, found in all of the  <dig> groups covered by our study . epa-containing strains were particularly frequent in the eustigmatophyceae, glaucophyta, xanthophyceae and rhodophyta. the highest epa proportions of total fa content were in the rhodophyta, with about 81% of the strains exhibiting more than 10% epa. the highest values were  <dig> % in compsopogonopsis leptoclados sag  <dig>  and  <dig> % in acrochaetium virgatulum sag  <dig> . also strains of three species of porphyridium contained high amounts of epa . this is in agreement with a report on p. cruentum suggesting that red algae are a rich source of epa  <cit> . despite epa was rather frequently found in the glaucophyta, only about half of all strains had epa proportions greater than 10% . this is in agreement with another study which showed high amounts of epa  in the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa  <cit> . the highest percentage  of strains with an epa proportion of greater than 10% was in the dinophyta, but with a maximum of just  <dig> % in pyrocystis lunula sag  <dig>  in the euglenoids, xanthophyceae and eustigmatophyceae about 67% of all strains had an epa proportion of greater than 10% with maximum values of about 31%  and  <dig> % in goniochloris sculpta sag  <dig> . epa was rarely found and mostly in insignificant amounts  in most green algae, but three strains had an exceptionally higher content of about 20% of total fas . epa was the only fa recovered from chlorarachnion repens sag  <dig>  . that xanthophyceae and eustigmatophyceae contain epa in relatively high proportions while green algae rarely accumulate epa supports previous studies  <cit> .

arachidonic acid ) was most frequently found in the phaeophyceae where it was present in all strains except one investigated strain ; in about 54% of all phaeophyceae strains the proportion of ara was higher than 10%, but with a maximum of just  <dig> % in halopteris filicina sag  <dig> . ara had the highest proportion of total fa in the rhodophyta; there even about 77% of all strains had an ara content of more than 10% with a maximum of  <dig> % in pseudochantransia sp. sag  <dig> . interestingly, the ara content was rather high but variable among the eight examined multiple isolates of the rhodophyte porphyridium purpureum. while the average ara proportion was about 31% in six strains, it was just  <dig> % in sag 1380-1d, but  <dig> % in sag 1380-1e. we have no explanation for this variation yet; both strains were isolated from marine habitats and are kept under the same culture conditions. high proportions of ara  were already found characteristic of another species of porphyridium cruentum  <cit> . ara was present in about half of all investigated euglenoid strains and with relatively high proportions of total fa content, i.e. about one third of the strains exhibited more than 5% ara with extraordinarily high values of  <dig> % and  <dig> % in rhabdomonas incurva sag 1271- <dig> and khawkinea quartana sag 1204- <dig>  interestingly, another strain of the same species k. quartana, sag 1204- <dig>  had less than half  of ara content and in five other species of rhabdomonas no ara was detected. this demonstrates that fa contents may be rather variable between species of the same genus and even among multiple isolates of the same species. although about half of all examined strains for the xanthophyceae and eustigmatophyceae contained ara , they had this fa in relatively low proportions. only one fourth of the ara-containing xanthophyceae strains exhibited more than 5% and in the eustigmatophyceae even no strain reached 5%. ara was rarely found in the green algae, i.e. with an average frequency of about 14% in the phyla chlorophyta and streptophyta, except for prasinophyte green algae where ara was present in  <dig> % of all strains . however, there were a few single green algal examples with extraordinarily high ara contents, i.e.  <dig> %  in the chlorophyte palmodictyon varium sag  <dig> , followed by  <dig> % in the chlorophyte trochisciopsis tetraspora sag  <dig>  and  <dig> % in the trebouxiophyte myrmecia bisecta sag  <dig>  that a high ara content was found in the latter strain is in agreement with that it has been found a close relative with parietochloris incisa   <cit> . p. incisa has been assigned an "oleaginous microalga" and the richest plant source of ara known so far due to its capability to accumulate high amounts of ara   <cit> . interestingly, the sag strain of p. incisa  had with  <dig> % a much lower ara content .

γ-linolenic acid ) was the third most common fa in the studied sample of sag microalgal strains, missing only in the haptophyta, dinophyta and euglenoids . it was most frequently detected in two lineages of green algae, the prasinophytes and the streptophyta. in prasinophytes, however, gla was present only in one out of five genera available for that group, tetraselmis, and there in  <dig> out of the  <dig> available strains and with variable proportions, i.e.  <dig>  -  <dig> % of total fa content. in the streptophyta, gla was more widely distributed, i.e. it was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> examined genera. gla distribution was rather variable within strains and species of a certain streptophyte genus, similar to findings of ara in other genera. relatively high percentages of gla were found in species/strains of closterium , but gla was not found in the other  <dig> strains of that genus. similarly, in the many strains available for cosmarium  and micrasterias , gla was found in only  <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively. the highest percentages of gla were found in the green algal class chlorophyceae  and in cyanobacteria . in about one third  of all chlorophyte gla strains this fa had precentages of 5% and higher. distribution of gla in the cyanobacteria was rather patchy, i.e. the  <dig> cyanobacteria strains with gla were mainly restricted to three genera, calothrix , microcystis  and spirulina . also within each of these genera the gla percentages were quite variable, e.g. in spirulina it varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, and three strains where without gla. fa composition has previously been used to discriminate cyanobacteria in isolates and natural samples at the generic level  <cit> . to discriminate species of cyanobacteria, as an additional marker the hydrocarbon composition was used in an earlier study, but in our study we failed to detect any substance out of this group  <cit> . interestingly, gla was the only fa that was detected in more than three out of the  <dig> examined strains. therefore, the sag cyanobacteria strains may be roughly divided into those with gla present  and those where almost no pufas were present. this corresponds to the earlier findings that described a bipartition of cyanobacteria, independent of their taxonomic position, into genera producing c- <dig> pufa and those which do not  <cit> .

the prasinophyte genus tetraselmis presented an interesting example to test for fa variation among closely related isolates. nine strains assigned to that genus have been isolated from the same  locality and regarded as the same species by the isolator . only in two strains dha was present, but in very small traces . in contrast, ara and gla were found in all isolates with percentages varying from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and  <dig> % to  <dig> %, respectively.

 <dig>  analysis of fa distribution patterns
the detected fatty acid  composition of the  <dig> investigated strains was statistically analyzed to test whether certain patterns of fa distribution among the various investigated algal groups are present that may correspond to their phylogenetic relationships. in a first set of three analyses  it was tested 1) whether fa distribution patterns may reflect differences among algal phyla derived from primary  or secondary endocytobiosis  compared to cyanobacteria representing the plastid origin, 2) the distinction of phyla within the plantae supergroup  and 3) major evolutionary lineages  within the chlorophyta. a second set of analyses focused at the generic level, i.e.it was tested whether separation of genera as based on previous 18s rdna sequence analyses suggested for chlamydomonas s.l., chlorella s.l. and scenedesmus s.l. are reflected in the fa distribution patterns. for the first set of analyses the many species  which were represented as multiple strains  had to be reduced to only a single strain per species to avoid biases. this included also the multiple strains unidentified at the species level, i.e. labelled with "sp." instead a species name . the sag's chlorophyta strains were particularly rich in such multiple strains. also excluded were those strains where only a single fa was detected. this reduced the total number of strains considered in our calculations to  <dig>  the strains were then divided into eleven groups roughly corresponding to phyla or classes . strains belonging to the chlorophyta  were further subdivided into the three classes, chlorophyceae, trebouxiophyceae, and ulvophyceae, whereas the prasinophyte sag green algal strains  were excluded from the analyses because they comprised only very few species . the strains of glaucophyta  and rhodophyta  were collectively treated as one composite unit. the rhizaria - chlorarachniophyta, was represented just by a single strain and, thus, was omitted from the statistical analyses.

higher taxonomic levels analyses
it was tested whether distribution patterns of fa composition on the investigated strains delineate the three "super groups" of eukaryotic algae, plantae, chromalveolates and excavates , and the cyanobacteria from each other. the plantae super group comprises exclusively eukaryotes with plastids derived from primary endocytobiosis, i.e. a cyanobacterium was transformed into an organelle through uptake and retention by the host cell followed by the loss of much of its genome  <cit> . chromalveolate algae as well as the euglenoids  acquired their plastids through secondary endocytobiosis from rhodophyte and a green alga, respectively  <cit> . to consider almost equal numbers of strains for all four groups,  <dig> strains of plantae, chromalveolates and cyanobacteria were randomly selected which closely amounts the total number of considered euglenoid strains . the ordination which resulted from cva  pointed out a strong difference between cyanobacteria/primary endocytobiosis  and the two groups representing secondary endocytobiosis  . the observed difference was without exception supported by non-parametric significance tests for multidimensional data . following simper, the lowest observed dissimilarity  was between cyanobacteria and plantae, while the highest  was between plantae and chromalveolates. the first canonical variate  involved  <dig> % of all possible differences among the four groups, hence we examined for possible correlations between this axis and fas. four fas were significantly and exclusively correlated with the first canonical variate , i.e. 16: <dig> , 18: <dig> , 9-octadecanamid , and 18: <dig> . in a second analysis it was tested whether fa distribution patterns distinguish phyla of the plantae super group, i.e. the two lineages of green algae, chlorophyta and streptophyta  <cit> , and the composite rhodophyta/glaucophyta group. because the latter was with  <dig> strains the smallest group, it was compared with equally large random samples from each the chlorophyta and streptophyta . the ordination diagram from a cva of the total of  <dig> investigated strains clearly separated the rhodophyta/glaucophyta group from both green algal phyla . cv <dig> involved 79% of all possible differences and even cv <dig> was with 21% not negligible. the significance tests, np-manova and anosim, supported the distinction of all three groups. simper showed the rhodophyta/glaucophyta composite group rather dissimilar from both green algal phyla, i.e. there were dissimilarities of  <dig> % and  <dig> % with the chlorophyta and streptophyta, respectively. the lowest dissimilarity  among the three tested groups was between chlorophyta and streptophyta. there were five fas significantly and exclusively correlated with cv <dig>  i.e. 18: <dig> , 20: <dig> , 20: <dig> , 18: <dig>  and 16: <dig> . two fas were correlated exclusively with cv <dig>  i.e. they discriminated chlorophyta and streptophyta, 18: <dig>  and 9-octadecanamid . the by far largest fraction of all considered strains  were from the chlorophyta which made it interesting to test whether fa distribution patterns can discriminate between the three classes of chlorophyta, the chlorophyceae, trebouxiophyceae and ulvophyceae. ulvophyceae was the smallest of the three with just  <dig> strains and, therefore, random samples of almost the same size  from each of the other two classes were used for the statistical analyses. the cva did not reveal any distinct groups, i.e. the analyzed strains tended to form three groups corresponding to the three green algal classes, but with a considerable overlap among them . however, the three classes were found significantly distinct from each other in both employed significance tests and simper. the latter and correlation analyses allowed to consider 9-octadecanamid  and the fa 18: <dig>  as the only variables to discriminate well ulvophyceae from chlorophyceae/trebouxiophyceae and trebouxiophyceae from ulvophyceae/chlorophyceae, respectively.

generic level analyses
the three previous analyses showed that phylogenetic relationships at the level of phyla and classes among algal groups were reflected in fa distribution patterns using a large sample of strains. therefore, in a second group of analyses, we tested whether differences in fa distribution patterns may resolve the same distinction of genera as in rrna gene sequence analyses. to test this, we selected three genera which are widely used in biotechnological applications and well represented by sag strains, i.e. chlorella s.l., scenedesmus s.l. and chlamydomonas s.l.. recent18s rrna gene sequence analyses revealed each of the three as para- or polyphyletic assemblages encompassing several distinct genera. for chlamydomonas we selected  <dig> species , out of which  <dig> were represented by multiple strains , which were distributed on five independent lineages/clades  in the 18s rdna phylogeny  <cit> . to better represent the "oogamochlamys" clade also two strains from the utex collection  were included. the nmds ordination clearly separated the members of the "reinhardtii" clade , except for three strains, from those of the "chloromonas" clade . however, the "chloromonas" group as revealed by the fa patterns also included the three investigated strains of the "moewusii" and four of the "oogamochlamys" clades which was in contrast to the 18s rdna phylogenies of  <cit> . also in contrast to the rdna phylogenies, the fa analyses split the genus lobochlamys, i.e. l. culleus was part of the "chloromonas" group while l. segnis belonged to the "reinhardtii" group. strains of oogamochlamys were also separated on both fa groups, in contrast to their species assignments as based on the 18s rdna analyses.

species and strains formerly assigned to a single genus scenedesmus were shown to be actually distributed on several genera by rrna gene sequence analyses. for example, the genus acutodesmus has been segregated from scenedesmus  <cit> . a nmds ordination plot of fa distribution patterns revealed a tendency among the studied strains to be distributed on two clusters, i.e. one cluster of  <dig> strains of acutodesmus  was clearly separated from another cluster containing mainly strains of scenedesmus s.str. . the multiple strains of s. vacuolatus were grouped together with four other strains of the genus, except for sag 211-11n which was close to the acutodesmus cluster. the multiple strains of a. obliquus, however, were distributed on both clusters . seven strains of a. obliquus mainly formed up the acutodesmus cluster, whereas five other a. obliquus strains grouped together with strains of scenedesmus s.str. this means that within the same green algal species, a. obliquus, two distinct fa patterns exist. aflp fingerprints already showed extensive genetic variation among the multiple strains of a. obliquus while its <dig> rdna sequence comparisons demonstrated conspecificity of the multiple strains, except for sag 276- <dig> . therefore, the finding of a. obliquus strains being separated in two fa pattern groups favours the view that genetic differences resolved by aflps may correspond to different phenotypic properties. consequently, it may be crucial to carefully record which strain has been used in any application  <cit> . though strain sag 276- <dig> was found not to belong to the same species, a. obliquus, its fa pattern suggests that it may still be a member of acutodesmus because it was grouped in the acutodesmus cluster .

chlorella vulgaris forms another example where extensive genetic variation among multiple strains of the same species has been detected by aflp analyses  <cit> . the  <dig> multiple sag strains of c. vulgaris were compared to  <dig> other chlorella and chlorella-like strains, i.e. their closest relatives as seen in 18s rdna phylogenies, c. sorokiniana and c. lobophora, members of the parachlorella clade sensu  <cit>  as well as more distantly related strains, i.e. from the watanabea and prasiola clades sensu  <cit> . nmds ordination based on fa distribution pattern showed almost no variation within the multiple strains of c. vulgaris and clustered them together, except for strain sag 211-1e . another cluster distant from c. vulgaris was formed by members of the watanabea-clade, whereas chlorella-like algae of the prasiola-clade were not clustered together.

CONCLUSIONS
the algae collection at the sag represents a valuable resource of natural products as shown in the present study for fas and other hydrophobic metabolites. several general trends in fa distribution reflect phylogenetic relationships among phyla and classes as seen in genomic and molecular phylogenies and this makes fa distribution patterns an additional feature to define taxa of higher rank in algae. however the fa profile alone may be no useful marker to distinguish among different genera and species. for this, the comparison of further metabolites, like sterols, entire lipids and hydrocarbons should be considered. thus, pufa contents in microalgae are rather difficult to predict at the levels of genera and species, making it difficult to select appropriate strains for biotechnological research/applications which aim at yielding high lipid contents. therefore, each additional or novel isolate will be worth of examination for its pufa content.
