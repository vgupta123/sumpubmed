BACKGROUND
the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa has broad capabilities to thrive in diverse ecological niches and to establish serious human infections  <cit> . poor clinical outcome of p. aeruginosa-associated infection was described in immunocompromised patients and those in intensive care units, connected to mechanical ventilation or other invasive devices. p. aeruginosa is also the leading cause of chronic lung infections and death in patients with cystic fibrosis , as well as a frequent cause of exacerbations in individuals with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> .

the genetic basis of p. aeruginosa leading to acute or chronic infection is not yet understood  <cit> . genome sequencing projects are underway with the aim of providing new data to dissect the molecular basis of p. aeruginosa infections. seventeen completely sequenced and assembled genomes are currently available and draft genomes exist for  <dig> additional genomes. the genome size of p. aeruginosa is larger than those of most sequenced bacteria and varies between  <dig>  and  <dig> mbp, with ~ <dig> orfs  <cit> . a significant number  of p. aeruginosa genes are predicted to be involved in regulation, which at the time of publication was the largest fraction of regulators among sequenced bacterial genomes. irrespective of their origin, p. aeruginosa isolates share a remarkable amount of similarity in their genome content and in virulence traits . the extent of divergence between strains is determined by extra-chromosomal elements like plasmids or blocks of dna inserted into the chromosome at various loci  <cit> . these genetic features are likely to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer from different sources including other species or genera and can be present in subgroups of the p. aeruginosa population but may also be unique to single strains, accounting for most of intra- and inter-clonal p. aeruginosa genome diversity. these strain-specific segments of the genome are not scattered randomly through the core genome; rather, they tend to be clustered in certain loci, referred to as regions of genome plasticity   <cit> . the genetic sequences occupying many rgps are often referred to as genomic islands  and islets. therefore, the p. aeruginosa chromosome presents a picture of a mosaic, consisting of a conserved core component, interrupted in each strain by the inserted parts of the accessory genome. genetic elements within the accessory genome may encode properties that contribute to niche-specific adaptation of the particular strains that harbor them.

furthermore, mutations of single nucleotides also confer specific p. aeruginosa phenotypes that are advantageous under certain conditions . long-term colonization of the cf host is maintained by p. aeruginosa pathoadaptive lineages, which are clonal with the initially acquired strain and carry phenotypic variants. pathoadaptive mutations are frequent in virulence genes, essential for acute infection but no longer compatible with the novel lifestyle of the p. aeruginosa in cf airways. however, little is known about the genetic basis and the biology of host-bacteria interactions leading to a persistent lifestyle of p. aeruginosa.

to define the genetic basis of p. aeruginosa persistent lifestyle, longitudinal isolates from cf patient were selected. in particular, p. aeruginosa rp <dig> was isolated after long-term chronic infection and compared with the preceding rp <dig> and clonal rp <dig>  as well as prototype pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains. when murine model of chronic lung infection was used, rp <dig> showed a marked persistent lifestyle. thus, genome sequencing and comparative genomics analysis were carried out. our results show the links between genomic properties and pathogenic potential of rp <dig> that may define the basis of long-term chronic infection by p. aeruginosa. the significance of these results is discussed in the context of understanding disease pathogenesis.

RESULTS
chronic colonization of a cf patient’s airways with the p. aeruginosa rp isolates
cf was suspected in the exocrine-insufficient patient index case rp  by a positive meconium test at birth and was confirmed by pathological sweat tests at the age of 4 months. the rp patient’s airways became colonized with p. aeruginosa by the age of 7 years . the cf clinic in hannover has collected sequential isolates from this patient since the onset of colonization for up to 28 years  <cit> . the patient was chronically carrying p. aeruginosa isolates of clone type oc2e, for the first eleven years. during this time period strains of the clone type oc4a were sporadically isolated, but thereafter oc4a has become the dominant clone type until today. the rp patient received one to four annual 2-week courses of intravenous  antipseudomonal chemotherapy since onset of colonization and was administered aerosolized colistin on a daily basis during the last 17 years. the last clone type oc2e strain was isolated from the patient’s sputum four months after the start of colistin inhalation. the patient’s clinical status remained stable during the 28 years of chronic airway infection. lung function parameters fluctuated between  <dig> and 90 % predicted for forced vital capacity  and 60–80 % forced expiratory volume  during the last 20 years with no tendency to irreversible decline.fig.  <dig> 
p. aeruginosa sequential isolates from patient rp. two clone types  of p. aeruginosa strains were isolated from patient rp who is heterozygous for f508del and r1162x mutations in the cftr gene. oc2e was isolated at the onset of chronic colonization for the first eleven years. thereafter oc4a became the dominant clone. strain rp <dig> belongs to the clone type oc2e and was the first p .aeruginosa strains isolated. strains rp <dig> and rp <dig> belong to the clone type oc4a and were isolated after  <dig> and  <dig>  years respectively after the onset of chronic colonization of the patient’s airways with p. aeruginosa . lung function parameters at the time of p. aeruginosa isolation are indicated



in this study three p. aeruginosa isolates from rp patient were selected for genetic and biological characterization. rp <dig> was the first p. aeruginosa isolate and belongs to clone type oc2e, while rp <dig> and rp <dig>  isolated after  <dig> and  <dig>  years from the onset of colonization, belong to clone type oc4a . thus, rp <dig> p. aeruginosa isolate was able to establish long-term infection replacing the initially rp <dig> acquired isolate and likely adapting within cf airways respect to rp <dig> 

pathogenicity of p. aeruginosa rp isolates in murine model of airways infection
to translate data from cf patients into disease models, p. aeruginosa clinical isolates rp <dig>  rp <dig> and rp <dig> were tested in the agar beads mouse model of chronic airways infection in comparison to prototype pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains  <cit> . bacteria embedded in the immobilizing agents appear to grow in the microaerobic/anaerobic conditions in form of microcolonies, similarly to the growth in the mucus of patients with cf  <cit> . rp <dig> isolate, as well as prototype pa <dig> strain, caused death in all mice  within the first three days of p. aeruginosa infection . lower incidence of mortality  was recorded after infection with rp <dig> strain, while rp <dig> were not lethal . thus, despite their clonality, rp <dig> and rp <dig> were significantly different in the risk of death. as previously reported, prototype pao <dig> showed 24 % of acute mortality  <cit> . next, the capacity to establish chronic infection in the surviving mice was assessed at 14 days. nearly all mice had chronic airways colonization by rp <dig>  and rp <dig> , demonstrating the persistent lifestyle of this lineage among surviving mice. pao <dig> strain showed less capacity to establish chronic infection . the ability of the clinical isolate rp <dig> to achieve long-term chronic infection associated with no risk of mortality in mice was superior to all other p. aeruginosa clinical strains tested in previous studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> virulence of p. aeruginosa rp isolates in comparison with prototype strains in murine model. c57bl/6ncrlbr mice were infected with 1-2*106 cfu/lung p. aeruginosa rp <dig>  rp <dig>  rp <dig>  pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains embedded in agar beads. mortality induced by bacteremia  and survival  was evaluated on challenged mice. clearance  and capacity to establish chronic infection  were determined on surviving mice after 14 days. the data show the percentage of mice infected with single p. aeruginosa strains analyzed in two to three independent experiments. statistical significance by chi-square test is indicated: *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



to assess clinical trait of chronic infection, lung histopathology was performed after 14 days from p. aeruginosa challenge with the persistent rp <dig> isolate. chronic pulmonary disease, including inflammation and mucus secretory cells, was detected. the bronchi were filled by a massive neutrophil inflammation, whereas the parenchyma was infiltrated by macrophages, lymphocytes and some neutrophils . agar beads were observed in bronchial lumina . mucous secretory cells hyperplasia  was found. these features resembled lesions found in cf patients with advanced chronic pulmonary disease  <cit> .fig.  <dig> histological lesions after chronic p. aeruginosa infection in mice. mice were infected with 2x <dig> cfu/lung of p. aeruginosa rp <dig> strain embedded in agar beads and lung harvested after 14 days from challenge. histopathological analysis of lungs chronically infected by rp <dig> strain are characterised by acute and chronic lesions; the pulmonary parenchyma is infiltrated by macrophages, lymphocytes and some neutrophils . agar beads  containing bacteria macrocolonies  are localised in the bronchia and surrounded by a massive neutrophils inflammation . alcian blue staining shows mucus secretory cells hyperplasia  



genome sequences of rp isolates and comparative genomics analyses
to link the persistent lifestyle with a genetic basis, we sequenced the genome of rp <dig>  <cit> , in addition to those of preceding rp <dig> and clonal rp <dig> isolates, and performed comparative genomic analysis. the fully assembled rp <dig> genome consists of a single circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs . twelve genomic islands were predicted in this genome ; three of them distinguished rp <dig> from other prototype strains and corresponded to regions of genome plasticity   <cit> . they include known genomic islands pagi- <dig>  which is similar to rearrangement hot spots   <cit> , and plasmid pklc <dig>  which carries the pil gene cluster and chvb glucan synthetase  <cit> . nucleotide blast search on ncbi limited to p. aeruginosa showed that the former can be found in multiple clinical isolates, while the latter is identical to rp <dig> only in strain  <dig>  isolated from the human gut. however, plasmid pklc <dig> is often partially present  <cit> . a smc <dig> crispr repeat sequence also differentiates rp <dig> from most prototype strains  <cit> . in fact, blast search for this sequence resulted in a single hit from soil strain azotobacter chroococcum ncimb  <dig>  the rp <dig> genome also contains full length lesgi- <dig>  which was identified in the liverpool epidemic strain   <cit> . genomic islands predicted in rp <dig> were investigated in the draft genomes of rp <dig> and rp <dig>  while rp <dig> carries all  <dig>  rp <dig> lacks full-length plasmid pklc <dig> and an abc transporter protein. a circular map comparing the  <dig> sequenced rp genomes clearly shows the genomic similarity between rp <dig> and rp <dig> on one hand, and between rp <dig> and strain pa <dig>  which showed similar results in the murine infection model, on the other .table  <dig> predicted genomic islands in the genome of p. aeruginosa rp <dig> and comparison with other rp isolates and prototype strains

in order to study the evolution of chronic infection and determine which genetic determinants are involved in this process, further comparisons were made among rp isolates. first, analyses were carried out to study the relationship between these three strains. a core genome phylogeny was performed using  <dig> sequences from a previous study  <cit>  representing an extensive sampling of p. aeruginosa’s diversity. in the resulting tree , rp <dig> and rp <dig> cluster together while rp <dig> is found in a different and independent branch. a multi-locus sequence typing  analysis was also performed. rp <dig> and rp <dig> shared the same mlst profile while rp <dig> showed a different one . all these analyses suggest that rp <dig> and rp <dig> are close to each other from a genetic point of view, while rp <dig> is more distantly related.fig.  <dig> core genome phylogeny for rp isolates and strains representative of p. aeruginosa diversity. the figure represents a partial view of the tree to show the relationships between rp <dig>  rp <dig> and rp <dig>  the position of rp <dig> is indicated in blue, while the position of rp <dig> and rp <dig> is indicated in red. pa <dig> is distantly related to all these strains



in order to explain the molecular bases of the development of chronic infection in a cf context, snps were determined between pa <dig> and rp <dig> compared to rp <dig> and rp <dig>  a genomic comparison between pao <dig> and rp <dig> was already performed by hilker et al.  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  snps was found by taking pa <dig> as reference strain and searching for positions at which at least one among rp <dig>  rp <dig> and rp <dig> strains showed a different nucleotide compared to pa <dig>  about one fifth of these snps  were non-synonymous substitutions  that are likely to have an effect on protein function and structure. several of these snps were located in virulence genes representing good candidates to explain the diversity in patterns of mortality and chronicity we observed.

virulence factors of rp isolates and their putative role in pathogenicity
the genome of rp isolates contains most of the virulence factors, described for other p. aeruginosa genomes and identified in the virulence factor  database   <cit> , with few exceptions. several vfs of rp <dig> isolate shows signatures of pathoadaptive mutations within the genome when compared to the preceding clonal rp <dig> isolate as reported in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  phenotypic characterization of rp isolates is reported  and their putative role in pathogenicity discussed.table  <dig> phenotypic characterization of p. aeruginosa rp isolates and prototype strains

motility, adherence and cell interaction
pili, flagella and outer membrane proteins promote motility, attach to epithelial or endothelial cells, activate or inactivate host cellular pathways and immune responses  <cit> . these p. aeruginosa vfs play a key role in acute infection and are present in rp <dig> isolate. variations in the twitching and swimming motility are common in p. aeruginosa isolates from cf patients and described to be hallmarks of bacterial adaptation to the airways  <cit> . both rp <dig> and its clonal rp <dig> isolate did not encode pilv, pilw, pily <dig> and fimt and carried a premature stop mutation in pilo ; while pila and pilc were deleted in all isolates from rp patient. the rp <dig> and rp <dig> phenotypes are consistent with the absence of twitching and swimming motility . lack of motility was associated with decreased virulence in models of acute infection  <cit>  and increased risk of chronic infection  <cit> . our results obtained in rp <dig> and rp45-infected mice  are consistent with the observation that unlike strains rp <dig>  pa <dig> and pao <dig>  favor long-term persistence.table  <dig> comparative pathogenomics of mutations present in the major virulence factors of rp isolates respect to the prototype strain pao <dig> and evaluation in others p. aeruginosa sequenced strains

lipopolysaccharides  are potent immune stimulants through their interactions with toll-like receptor  <dig> . p. aeruginosa strains isolated from cf patients evolved the capacity to reduce host immuno-detection by modulating lps structure  <cit> . biochemical and biological characterization of rp <dig> lps showed to possess an under-acylated lipid a leading to a lower pro-inflammatory capacity in a murine model of intranasal instillation when compared to the lps from the prototype strain pao <dig>  <cit> . this structure is distinguished by the absence of hexa- or hepta-acylated lipid a species that are typical phenotypic changes that can occur on the lps molecule of a p. aeruginosa chronic strain. furthermore, rp <dig> carries an r-type lps without o-antigen in which the lipid a is covalently linked to the core oligosaccharide region. absence of lps o-antigen in rp <dig> suggests an adaptation of this strain to persistent lifestyle.

among genes responsible for lipid a modification   <cit> , our genetic characterization showed that rp <dig> isolate carries a stop mutation and lacks of the c-terminus of the protein in lpxo <dig> compared to the preceding clonal rp <dig>  as well as rp <dig> isolate and prototype pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains . both rp <dig> and rp <dig> isolates carry a non-synonimous snp in the sequence of pagl compared with rp <dig> and pa <dig> . these data suggests that an adaptive process has occurred to the lps structure of the rp lineage in the period of time between the isolation of rp <dig> and rp <dig> 

secretion systems and toxins
in p. aeruginosa genome, the genes  encoding the type iii secretion system  are clustered together. the psc and prc genes primarily encode components of the bacterial secretion apparatus whereas the exs gene products are involved in regulation of ttss. two pop genes encode proteins  essential for the translocation of the effectors into host cells. remarkably, rp <dig> isolate lost the entire 32-gene cluster encoding the t3ss which was present in the preceding clonal rp <dig>  as well as rp <dig> and prototype pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains   <cit> . however, the exos, exot, and exoy genes encoding for the “t3ss translocated effectors” are still present both in rp <dig> and rp <dig> genome with two non-synonymous snps recorded in the exot when compared with rp <dig> and pa <dig> . t3ss is an important virulence determinant of p. aeruginosa which may act at the site of infection and contribute to subversion of the host immune response. in contrast to acute infection, small proportion of isolates infecting cf patients secrete t3ss proteins and this proportion decreases with duration of infection  <cit> . we speculate that the differences in the risk of mortality associated to rp <dig> and rp <dig> isolates may be linked to absence or presence of the t3ss that changed during the progression of cf chronic infection.

genes encoding for toxa, hcna, hcnb and hcnc are present. however, rp <dig> has two non-synonymous snps compared with its clonal isolate rp <dig>  as well as rp <dig> and pa <dig>  in hcnc gene. if we consider the exotoxin a, we observed several non-synonymous snps .

finally, plda coding for the periplasmic phospholipase d , one of effectors of the type vi secretion system  <cit> , is absent in rp <dig> genome. however plda is reported to be not conserved among p. aeruginosa genomes  <cit> .

iron uptake and pigment
the ability to produce siderophores, like pyochelin and pyoverdine, has been linked to the bacterial pathogenic potential. phenotypic assay showed that rp isolates secreted lower  or no  levels of siderophores when compared to pao <dig> and pa <dig> . when we look at the genome sequence, both rp <dig> and rp <dig> carries stop mutations both in pchd, while pvdd protein is interrupted in rp <dig> only. pchd and pvdd are both involved in the synthesis of the two principal siderophores . pvdd production was shown to be required for airways bacterial colonization in rat, lethal virulence in burned and immunosuppressed mouse models  <cit> . pyoverdine was detected in the sputa of cf patients  <cit> , while in a larger study, one-third of sputa positive for p. aeruginosa contained no detectable pyoverdine  <cit> . these data suggests that pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake may not always be essential for chronic infection and other mechanisms are active in cf  <cit> .

phenotypic tests showed that rp <dig> and rp <dig> are able to secrete less pyocyanin when compared to rp <dig>  pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains . no changes in genes involved in pyocyanin biosynthesis were found, however in rp <dig> and rp <dig> were found non-synonymous snps in several genes belonging to the two phenazine biosynthesis operons  if compared with the non-clonal isolate rp <dig> and the prototype strain pa <dig> . pyocyanin is required for full virulence in animal models and has been detected in patients’ airway secretions, promoting virulence by interfering with several cellular functions in host cells including electron transport, cellular respiration, energy metabolism, gene expression, and innate immune mechanisms  <cit> .

mucoidy
rp isolates are phenotypically non-mucoid  with absence of mutations in mucabd locus. other key regulators of alginate pathway are present . the phenotypic switch to mucoidy in p. aeruginosa infections is a well-established paradigm in cf. infection with the mucoid phenotype, which produces large amounts of the exopolysaccharide alginate, has been associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary function than infection with non-mucoid bacteria  <cit> . however, some but not all p. aeruginosa isolates became mucoid in the cf lung suggesting that a mucoid phenotype did not always confer a selective advantage to bacterial cells in persistence  <cit> . in mouse model, cf clonal strains, displaying a mucoid and a non-mucoid phenotype, showed a similar capacity of persistence  <cit> . our data obtained in mouse model with rp <dig> and rp <dig> isolates support the notion that non-mucoid p. aeruginosa strains are able of long-term persistence.

quorum sensing
in p. aeruginosa, many virulence determinants and secondary metabolites are regulated in a cell population density-dependent manner via cell-to-cell communication or “quorum sensing”   <cit> . p. aeruginosa possesses two n-acylhomoserine lactone -dependent qs systems. these are termed the las and rhl systems, consisting of the luxri homologues, lasri and rhlri, respectively. rp isolates have no mutations in lasi, rhlr and rhli genes. however, inactivation of the transcriptional regulator lasr, carrying a stop mutation in the gene sequence , was found both in rp <dig> and rp <dig>  while the rp <dig> has no changes. the distinctive lasr mutant phenotype was confirmed by colony morphology that includes surface iridescent sheen and colony flattening exclusively in rp <dig> and rp <dig>   <cit> .

mutations in lasr lead to several phenotypic changes of potential clinical significance, including a growth advantage in amino acid abundant cf airway secretions. lasr regulates the production of virulence factors  affecting the immune response and antibiotic resistance  <cit> . most importantly, lasr mutations are often associated with the progression of cf lung disease and may serve as a marker of early cf adaptive change of prognostic significance  <cit> .

antibiotic resistance
rp <dig> showed remarkable resistance to most of the antibiotic classes while the preceding rp <dig> and rp <dig> isolates were not, indicating an increased treatment-refractory during the course of the chronic infection in this cf patient . a strong link between antibiotic resistance and hypermutation was observed in patients with cf  <cit> . however, rp <dig> strain does not have mutations in muts, mutl and uvrd, described previously as responsible for the hypermutable phenotype  <cit> . regarding efflux pumps, the rp <dig> strain did not show mutation in mexef-oprn, mexcd-oprj and mexxy. respectively one and six non-synonymous snps are present in the sequence of mexc and mexd of rp <dig> when compared with its clonal isolate rp <dig>  no insertions or deletions in ampc, ampr, mexr, mexz and oprd were detected. an insertion at the n-terminal of mexa and a non-synonymous snp was found in rp <dig> and rp <dig> . mexa belongs to the efflux pump complex mexab-oprm, which is anchored to the inner membrane via n-terminal fatty acids. adaptive mutations in mexa have been reported in cf isolates  <cit> .

additional modifications were detected at the n-terminal of mext, which is not conserved in rp <dig> and rp <dig> . an additional non-synonymous aa change at position  <dig> was found in rp <dig> when compared to rp <dig> . mext plays a pleiotropic role in modulating p. aeruginosa virulence such as ttss, pyocyanin production and early surface attachment  <cit> . similarly to mexa, also mext is an hallmark of p. aeruginosa adaptation in cf patients  <cit> . among the additional  <dig> pao <dig> coding sequence annotated as “antibiotic resistance and susceptibility”, only arr, a putative aminoglycoside response regulator, is absent in all strains from rp patient.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our study combined clinical data, whole-genome analysis and animal models to link the persistent lifestyle of p. aeruginosa in cf lungs with the bacterial genetic basis. starting from a clinical case of cf, p. aeruginosa rp <dig> was isolated after long-term chronic infection and compared with the preceding rp <dig> and clonal rp <dig>  as well as prototype pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains. when tested in the animal model, p. aeruginosa rp <dig> isolate, but not other strains, mimics most of the traits of airways infection and inflammation observed in cf patients. these results suggested that key features of rp <dig> isolate may contribute to its pathogenesis. the genome sequence of rp <dig> and comparative genomics analysis with other p. aeruginosa genomes, pointed clearly to signatures of pathoadaptive mutations within the genome. this in turn correlated with the major impact on the in vitro phenotypes and in vivo maintenance observed and described here. our findings support and better define the hypothesis that genes encoding major virulence factors are deleted and/or contain beneficial mutations when p. aeruginosa establishes long-term chronic infection. the results presented in this study provide important information with respect to the p. aeruginosa mosaic genome structure and chronic infections found in cf patients.
