BACKGROUND
alternative splicing of pre-mrna is a post-transcriptional modification essential for the regulation of gene expression and function. through alternative splicing, multiple transcripts are produced from a single mrna precursor, widely expanding proteome diversity. deep sequencing applied to diverse human tissues and epithelial cell lines has recently revealed that more than 90% of human genes undergo alternative splicing  <cit> . a global analysis of alternative splicing in the human transcriptome suggested that exon skipping is the most prevalent form of alternative splicing  <cit> . alternative splicing is a tightly regulated process influenced by cell type, developmental stage, external conditions, etc; however, it is also associated with multiple disease conditions, including cancer  <cit> . for example, cancer-related aberrantly spliced variants have been shown to be actively involved in the initiation and/or progression of some types of cancer  <cit> . splicing alterations are the consequence of splice-site mutations, deregulation of splicing regulatory factors, or both  <cit> . tumor-specific variations in splicing may generate new epitopes that can serve as a starting point for immune therapy or targeted delivery, as well as for the development of new diagnostic or prognostic tools  <cit> . thus, the identification and molecular characterization of alternative splicing variants associated with cancer is currently a very active area of research  <cit> . in recent years, powerful techniques for genome-wide identification and analysis of alternative splicing isoforms have been developed. these large-scale high-throughput analytical methods have been applied to the identification of differential splicing events in cancer tissues  <cit> . exon microarrays, which contain both known and predicted exons, have been recently used for this purpose  <cit> . however, since they are not specifically designed to examine alternative splicing, they fail to detect events such as the alternative use of 5' or 3' splice sites, intron retention, or the insertion of cryptic exons. other splicing-specific microarrays have been developed to cover most alternative splicing events. these arrays contain oligonucleotide probes that span exon-exon junctions, and probes positioned within exons to determine individual exon levels and overall transcript expression. the use of splice-junction oligonucleotides to analyze splice events was proposed as early as  <dig>  when morgan and ward used them to identify differential splice forms of minute virus in mice cdna  <cit> . in  <dig>  lockhart et al. reported one of the first genome-wide microarray studies and suggested the potential of microarrays for the analysis of alternative splicing  <cit> , but it was not until  <dig> that clark et al. developed the first microarray containing splice-junction oligonucleotides to analyze splice events in yeast  <cit> . in  <dig>  johnson et al. used microarrays containing oligonucleotide probes complementary to exon-exon junction sequences to discover new alternative splice variants in human tissues  <cit> . also in  <dig>  wang et al. designed an algorithm that aimed to deconvolute the absolute concentrations of each alternative transcript present in a complex mixture starting from the hybridization intensities detected on splice chips  <cit> . a new algorithm, called space, has recently been developed for estimating the number of different splicing isoforms , and determining their structures and relative concentrations  <cit> .

nonetheless, currently available splice arrays still have many limitations, mainly due to problems in the design of the array, the labeling protocol, and data analysis. the development of robust and efficient splice microarrays and data-analysis methods will facilitate progress in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of cancer and other pathologies. in the present work, we describe a novel comprehensive methodology for high-throughput profiling of alternative splicing in complex biological samples. in this methodology, processing of results is based on the array specific design, which is original and thought specifically for alternative splicing-discovery. the strategy consists of optimization of probe design, development of an unbiased amplification protocol that avoids inappropriate transcript coverage due to 3'-biased labeling, and implementation of detailed data processing. oligonucleotides for the splice array were designed using the tethys module , an inhouse oligo design program, complemented with a new splice-analysis specific module . the algorithm targets the best possible oligonucleotide for each sequence, rather than imposing a strict oligonucleotide quality cutoff. a new labeling protocol was developed to ensure optimal all-length transcript coverage and lineal amplification, working with small amounts of human material. to analyze the data, we developed a novel algorithm for the analysis of two-color arrays that allows for a statistically robust identification of candidate spliced genes in absence of a prior hypothesis about the contributing isoforms. we have applied this technology to the identification of lung cancer-associated splicing variants. lung cancer is a devastating disease with few therapeutic options or suitable molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis. the results obtained in this study validated the utility of the platform, allowing the identification of new cancer-associated splicing variants with potential utility in the management of lung cancer.

RESULTS
development and validation of the unbiased labeling protocol
the basis for the reliable detection of splice forms in a microarray format is a high-quality, non-biased labeling procedure. different labeling protocols have been applied in splicing analyses:  castle et al. developed a pcr + t <dig> amplification-based protocol  <cit> ;  a commercial kit is available from stratagene  to produce a labeled first-strand cdna using random hexamers which works well if a sufficient amount of starting material is available;  some authors have applied standard 3'-biased rna labeling protocols, ignoring the loss of 5' events.

considering the valuable and limited starting material of human clinical samples , as well as ours and others previous experience in expression microarray studies with crna lineal-amplified material by in vitro transcription  <cit> , we developed a novel protocol for the detection of alternative splice events consisting of the following steps :  extraction of polya + rna;  first-strand cdna synthesis employing a chimeric primer including the t <dig> promoter sequences and a stretch of  <dig> random bases starting from  <dig> ng of polya + rna;  second-strand cdna synthesis; and  in vitro transcription using the t <dig> rna polymerase in the presence of a labeled ribonucleotide . for a first validation of performance, three different yeast sequences were tested, ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> bp to cover any outlier isoform length. pcr-amplified yeast control sequences and the corresponding high-quality yeast control oligonucleotides were used on the microarray surface to assess whether a bias with respect to oligonucleotide position within the transcript had occurred. while some variations in signal intensity of the different oligonucleotides were identified, there was no evidence of 3'- or 5'-end bias . the same controls were included later in the lung array design. all human samples  were spiked-in with a mix of the three yeast controls to monitor unbiased 3'-5' transcripts coverage and labeling. the yeast control spike-in mix was prepared in different proportions to check significant signals throughout the dynamic range of the microarray experiments. the quantity of the yeast spike-in mix was optimized to avoid interference with the correct amplification of the human samples.

performance of the array in the evaluation of artificial splicing forms
in the next step, the hybridization behavior of high-quality oligonucleotides for the yeast controls spiked into the mixture was evaluated and then compared with that of their corresponding thermodynamical half-oligonucleotides. half-oligonucleotides contain the thermodynamic half of the total control oligonucleotides  complemented to the size of the total oligonucleotide with a sequence not expected to hybridize with the yeast control sequence. the half-oligonucleotides thus represent an event in which the dna on one end of the junction is 100% joined to a different dna sequence. the use of half-oligonucleotides caused a sharp decrease in signal intensity compared with the complete oligonucleotides , illustrating that the hybridization temperature and washing conditions were adequate. nevertheless, most signals did not drop to zero and there was considerable variation in the relative signal intensities of both half-oligonucleotides, indicating that different splice forms can still contribute to the signal of oligonucleotides containing only half of the target sequence of a given transcript.

subsequently, we evaluated the behavior of our splice array in the detection of arna from artificial constructs of vegf, pcbp <dig>  and cdc <dig> genes. three different isoforms were used for vegf , two for pcbp <dig> , and a single isoform for cdc <dig>  different isoforms were compared at different concentrations, and their respective signal intensities on the pilot array were analyzed. a simplified genomic organization of the vegf and pcbp <dig> exons, as well as the hybridization scheme, is shown in figure 2a, and the different signal intensities for the relevant probes in figure 2b. the results confirmed the inherent capacities of the probes to differentiate between different isoforms. while these results were extremely promising, it should be noted that they were obtained with artificial gene fragments present at relatively high concentrations and in an experimental background of reduced complexity .

identification of alternatively spliced genes in lung cancer and selection of genes for validation
the positive results obtained in the pilot array using spiked-in isoforms of individual genes encouraged us to develop a splice array to identify differential splicing variants in complex biological samples, specifically, in clinical samples from patients with lung cancer. based on gene-expression databases  <cit> ,  <dig>  genes expressed in normal and tumor lung tissue were selected and used to design a splice array. the array contained  <dig>  exon probes and  <dig>  junction probes for the selected genes, control probes for the yeast yml059c, yor <dig>  and yil129c transcripts to monitor the labeling procedure, as well as control probes for maize transcripts , employed in standard gene expression analyses by oryzon .

differential splicing in the  <dig>  genes was then assessed with the splice array, by hybridization of  <dig> pairs of cy <dig> labeled tumor and cy <dig> labeled normal tissue samples  prepared from  <dig> non-small cell lung cancer  patients , as well as three self to self comparisons . the array data from this study have been submitted to gene expression omnibus http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo under accession no. gse <dig>  the results were analyzed with altpolyphemus , which allowed intensity changes of all the oligonucleotides for a given gene to be analyzed with respect to whether these changes reflected gene expression changes or isoform changes. essentially, after pre-processing  the algorithm first estimates the experimental variability of the microarray analysis platform using the data of the standard deviation of the gene probe data on the replicates of the self to self array.

to identify differences in expression level or splice forms, "change" is first assessed in the self to self hybridization. any change that is not clearly greater than the inherent variability of the measurement system is considered "no-change". in the self to self hybridization the standard deviation  can be calculated from the total gene probe dataset and correlated to the standard deviation of the control probe dataset . the data spreading for the total gene probe set was always a little higher than that for the control probes , which means that the control probes slightly underestimate the experimental variation. in tumor vs normal tissue experiments, it is not possible to measure directly the standard deviation for the no-change situation for the total gene probe data set , but the standard deviation on the control dataset  can be measured and the standard deviation for the no-change situation for the total gene probe dataset for the tumor vs normal array can be estimated . robust change can then be defined as change below or above the threshold th = ± 3σ*s,g, although more stringent cut-off can be applied if desired. once robust change is defined, the algorithm examines whether the ratios of the signal in the cy <dig> and cy <dig> channels for the exon and junction probes for a given gene  fall within the variability of the experiment  or outside of that variability ; i.e. below or above μg ± 3σ*s,g, μg being the mean value for the ratios of the signal in the cy <dig> and cy <dig> channels for all the oligos for gene g. note that μg for a gene with differential expression will be clearly over the threshold for the detection of change  but the variation among the different probes will be below that threshold . for a gene to be selected as a candidate for differential splicing, at least one probe has to fall outside of the limits of the marked threshold. the algorithm considers two hypotheses: the observed hybridization can be explained by a differential mixture of isoforms or by a whole gene expression change, and calculates the error of both hypotheses. if there is a possible isoform change, the algorithm establishes the "form change", an arbitrary and empirically defined figure to relatively rank the candidates. figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig> shows a typical output from the altpolyphemus software for a candidate gene susceptible to alternative splicing in lung cancer.

altpolyphemus can identify splice candidates on data from individual tumor vs. normal tissue comparisons or on data from replicate analysis; i.e. on the mean change for every probe in a given dataset. in performing the process on data from a biological replica analysis on a set of tumor vs. normal tissue comparisons, the aim is not only to identify individual splice variants but rather to identify those events that, because of their prevalence, appear to be more relevant. a strict biological replicate analysis was performed on the entire lung cancer set in which:  all values for a given oligonucleotide were considered ;  the signal cut-off for the oligonucleotide detection was set at the mean signal + 3σ*s,g of a negative control and the agilent background control oligonucleotides, thus selecting for genes expressed clearly above the signal detection level;  the fold change cut-off to make the selection was set at the mean fold change of the total array data set ± 3σ*s,g, selecting the most relevant changes. internal assessment of the performance of the algorithm with three self-to-self hybridizations was done for experimental variability. then altpolyphemus analyzed the average value from the biological replicate analysis and generated a list of genes ranked by the value of their "form change". this analysis generated  <dig> potential candidates. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> genes identified in the analysis.

validation of splice variants differentially expressed in lung cancer
differences in alternative splicing between primary nsclc tissue and normal lung tissue in the ten selected genes were validated by pcr and sequencing. validation was performed with samples from a group of patients included in the array  and an independent series of nsclc patients . ipo <dig> was used as the reference gene  <cit> . alterations in alternative splicing were confirmed in  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes: ceacam <dig>  fhl <dig>  mlph, and susd <dig> 

ceacam1
ceacam <dig>  is a transmembrane protein involved in intercellular binding and related to several normal and pathological processes  <cit> . alternatively spliced forms have been identified for ceacam <dig>  <cit> . our analysis predicted changes in the splicing of this gene around exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the isoforms generated by alternative usage of these exons are : ceacam1- <dig> , ceacam1- <dig> , and ceacam1-3a . to validate the results obtained in the splice array, pcrs were performed with primers specifically designed to identify these three different splice forms . samples from primary tumors and their corresponding normal lung tissue were use to evaluate the expression of these isoforms in samples from  <dig> nsclc patients,  <dig> previously included in the splice array  and  <dig> from an independent series. in all cases, the identity of the amplified variants was confirmed by sequencing. these results clearly showed that alternative splicing was extensive in lung cancer tissues at the predicted ceacam <dig> region. ceacam1- <dig> and ceacam1- <dig> were upregulated in tumors compared with their corresponding normal samples . thus, 92%  of the tumor samples expressed ceacam1- <dig> whereas only  <dig>  of the normal lung samples were positive for this isoform. more interestingly, ceacam1- <dig> expression was upregulated in  <dig>  of the tumors compared with their respective normal-tissue counterparts. nineteen tumors  and  <dig> normal lung samples  expressed ceacam1- <dig>  which was upregulated in  <dig> tumors . the predominance of the ceacam1-3a splice variant in cancer tissues was confirmed by conventional pcr  and quantified by real-time pcr in  <dig> cases . ceacam1-3a was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with their corresponding normal samples . this isoform was upregulated in  <dig> tumors , with an increase in expression ranging from 2- to 70-fold . the alternative use of exon  <dig> generates ceacam <dig> isoforms with either a long  or a short  cytoplasmic tail. we analyzed whether the upregulated isoforms ceacam1- <dig>  ceacam1- <dig>  and ceacam1-3a were l- or s-forms using primers specifically designed to detect these variants and concluded that primary lung tumors predominantly express the s-forms . finally, the expression of ceacam1- <dig>  ceacam1- <dig>  and ceacam1-3a was determined in a panel of  <dig> lung cancer cell lines derived from tumors of all the major histological subtypes , which demonstrated the expression of these three isoforms not only in nsclc but also in small cell lung cancer .

fhl1
the protein fhl <dig>  is mainly involved in skeletal muscle development  <cit> . of the alternative splicing variants described for fhl <dig>  <cit> , one of the best characterized is fhl1b , which contains an alternative exon  <dig>  hereafter designated as exon 6b . our splice array detected differential changes between normal lung and lung cancer patients in the use of exon  <dig> and exon 6b. these changes were validated by pcr in  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples from patients included in the splice array and  <dig> additional samples from the independent set. conventional pcr followed by sequencing revealed the expression of two fhl <dig> isoforms in lung samples: fhl <dig> and fhl1b . expression of the two isoforms was specifically quantified by real-time pcr. in agreement with previous reports in other types of cancer  <cit> , both were found to be downregulated in lung cancer specimens compared with normal lung tissue . interestingly, a significant change in the ratio between fhl <dig> and fhl1b was also observed . these data validate the differences found by the splice array and suggest that downregulation of fhl <dig> in lung tumors differentially affects one of the two expressed splice forms.

mlph
mlph  is a protein involved in the transport of melanosomes  <cit> . the mlph gene contains  <dig> exons and encodes a protein of  <dig> residues. results from our splice array suggested changes in splicing around exon  <dig>  and database analysis indicated the alternative use of this exon in different isoforms . this alternative isoform generates a protein  <dig> amino acids shorter than the normal protein. to validate the alternative splicing change,  <dig> samples from patients included in the splice array were analyzed . a specific downregulation of the isoform containing exon  <dig> was identified in  <dig> out of the  <dig> cases studied , confirming the results obtained by the splice array .

susd2
susd <dig>  is a recently identified single-pass type i membrane protein  <cit> . only one susd <dig> mrna variant has been described to date ; however, splice array data suggested lung cancer-associated changes close to the 5' and 3' ends of the mrna. to validate these results, normal and tumor-bearing lung tissues from  <dig> cases  were analyzed, with reduced expression of susd <dig> detected in lung cancer tissue compared with normal lung. regarding changes in alternative splicing, alterations in the 3' end but not in the 5' end of the mrna were found. in particular, frequent intron retention between exons  <dig> and  <dig> was observed . inclusion of intronic sequences within an mrna is termed exonization. in our study, exonization of intron  <dig> was detected in  <dig> cases , exonization of intron  <dig> in  <dig> cases , exonization of intron  <dig> in  <dig> cases , and exonization of intron  <dig> in  <dig> cases . exonization was not observed in any of the normal lung samples analyzed. since in most of the cancer samples with exonization only one or two introns were retained, amplification of contaminating genomic dna can be ruled out. nevertheless, to provide additional verification, ipo <dig> and gapdh were amplified with primers that allowed the detection of genomic dna and cdna. bands for gapdh and ipo <dig> cdna but not for their genomic dna were obtained . finally, a panel of  <dig> lung cancer cell lines was analyzed for the presence of introns retained in the mature mrna . a high frequency of exonization events was confirmed within susd <dig> mrna not only in nsclc, but in sclc as well.

discussion
this article reports the development of a platform for the analysis of differential alternative splicing in complex biological samples and its application to the discovery of alternative splice forms associated with lung cancer. microarray-based methods have been described previously for the identification of splicing events in different physiological and pathological conditions  <cit> . however, in spite of progress in development and interpretation, splice arrays still have many limitations and are far from attaining the level of standardization and robustness achieved with other high-throughput analytical methods, such as expression arrays  <cit> . these limitations involve several steps of the process, such as the array's design, the labeling protocol, and data analysis.

the detection of alternative splicing using arrays containing only exon probes is based on the idea that a discrete set of exons, some of which are skipped in the event of alternative splicing, constitute the final mrna. but this view is largely simplified, as exons may be longer or shorter, junctions may form at different positions, and intron sequences between two exons may be retained. in addition, some exons are very small, to the extent that any oligonucleotide designed to detect them would require the inclusion of sequences from flanking exons. even in the case of splice arrays that contain junction probes, the design of these probes is challenging. most splice arrays make use of oligonucleotides of constant length or tm, but they do not consider that the contributions of the two sequences on either side of the junction may be substantially different due to differences in sequence composition. probe quality is also affected by the strong spatial restrictions on oligonucleotide design required for the analysis of differential splicing. this leads to an inevitable breakdown of the strict thermodynamic and specificity criteria that are usually imposed on the design of an expression microarray. as for the labeling protocols, methods for standard gene-expression analysis are generally based on labeling from the 3' end, followed by detection with 3'-end probes. however, in a splicing analysis, the sequences of the oligonucleotides present in the array need to spread over the complete length of the transcripts, and the quality of the analysis strongly depends on homogeneous labeling of the rna. if the labeling protocol is inappropriate, hybridization of insufficient material create "absent" values; more importantly, if the intensity of a fraction  of the probes for a given gene drops below the detection limit, normal gene expression changes will lead to incorrect detections of splice changes. consequently, the rate of false-positive discovery would be considerable for genes expressed at low levels. additionally, in a splice array, data processing and the identification of genuine differential splicing events are more complex than in standard gene-expression arrays and require specific analytical algorithms. this is due to the larger variation in thermodynamic conditions and possible cross-hybridization or folding of sub-optimally designed probes. finally, an additional requirement for the analytical algorithm is the need to distinguish differential splicing from changes in gene expression levels. the methodology described in the present work has addressed all these limitations.

in designing the probes, we applied an oligonucleotide design algorithm that performs an in silico thermodynamic simulation of the hybridization procedure. the algorithm targets the best possible oligonucleotide for each sequence, rather than imposing a strict oligonucleotide quality cutoff. several control oligonucleotides were also designed and included in the array to control labeling and hybridization processes. the proper design and inclusion of control oligonucleotides, as well as appropriate use of the data generated by these controls in data processing, are especially relevant considering that technical variability can be introduced by the addition of steps in the labeling protocol necessary to avoid labeling biases. to analyze the data, we developed new software to interpret the intensity changes of all the oligonucleotides for a given gene and to decide whether they reflected expression changes or isoform changes.

the efficacy of our new methodology and its potential usefulness in a clinical setting were tested in an application designed to identify genes differentially spliced in primary lung tumors. lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide  <cit> , with the major form, nsclc, accounting for about 80% of all lung cancers. in spite of advances in early detection and treatment, overall 5-year survival rates for nsclc remain at about 15%  <cit> , underlining the need for a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of nsclc. it has been proposed that modifications in the concentration, localization, composition, or activity of rna-binding proteins acting as splicing regulatory factors induce the splicing alterations characteristic of lung cancer  <cit> . in this sense, the abnormal expression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins  in nsclc clinical samples and animal models suggests that tumors develop specific hnrnp profiles  <cit> . this alteration would generate clinically relevant alternative splice forms contributing to lung carcinogenesis. a recent report presented a genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing events in lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> . in that study, the authors obtained a list of cancer-related candidate genes showing alternative splicing events and implicated in cancer.

in the present study, the presence of differentially expressed splice variants in nsclc was evaluated using a splice array designed to detect near  <dig> genes known to be expressed in lung tissue. analysis of the splice array data generated a list of candidates, from which  <dig> genes were selected for validation. since one of the main purposes for this selection was to validate the quality of the detection process, no biological criteria were considered in the selection of the candidate genes at this point. rt-pcr experiments, followed by sequencing, were used to validate the results from the array, with changes in alternative splicing confirmed in four genes. as expected, the validation success was below the rates obtained in gene expression studies and was comparable to the rates reported in previous splicing studies  <cit> . regardless of the platform and algorithm used to detect differential splicing, by microarray or other hybridization-based analysis, it is important to realize that the technology is inherently sensitive to a number of errors that can lead to the incorrect identification of alternative splicing. for example, low-level expression can lead to the erroneous identification of splice events, due to the fact that not all oligonucleotides generate the same level of signal, and the signal of low-responsive oligonucleotides can drop below the detection limit thereby generating false "form changes" when the overall expression level differs between cy <dig> and cy <dig> channels. cross-hybridization, obviously, is another potential cause of the detection of false "form changes". while cross-hybridization can sometimes be suspected when the higher signal of one oligonucleotide compared to the others cannot be justified by a much higher tm or a sub-optimal design, it will generally go unnoticed until further detailed analysis is performed. moreover, there is no guarantee that all possible gene-structure changes are analyzed in the validation process, unless a very extensive validation approach is applied for any gene of interest . the four genes with lung cancer-associated alternative splice forms newly identified in this study were: ceacam <dig>  fhl <dig>  mlph, and susd <dig> 

ceacam <dig> is a cea-related cell adhesion molecule downregulated in several human cancer types, including prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers  <cit> . ceacam <dig> has been described as a lung tumor marker, and its expression has been associated with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> . two major ceacam <dig> isoforms have been described: a long  form and a short  form, which, respectively, include or exclude exon  <dig>  the exclusion of exon  <dig> generates a proximal stop codon that translates into a shorter cytoplasmic domain. tumor cells transfected with ceacam1-1l are less tumorigenic, suggesting that the l-form functions as a tumor suppressor gene  <cit> . wang et al. reported that ceacam1-4s is the predominant isoform in nsclc tissues, whereas in normal lung tissues the main isoform is ceacam1-4l  <cit> . this splice pattern was recently confirmed  <cit> . in addition to confirming previous data, our analysis predicted other changes in the splicing of ceacam <dig> around exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which were validated by pcr. for the first time, it was demonstrated that lung tumors frequently overexpress three splice isoforms: ceacam1- <dig>  ceacam1- <dig>  and ceacam1-3a. the alternative use of these exons affects different ig-like structural domains in the extracellular portion of the respective proteins.

the family of four and a half lim  proteins, also known as skeletal muscle lim proteins , is characterized by four complete lim domains preceded by an n-terminal half lim domain  <cit> . lim domains are cysteine-rich, double zinc-finger motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. fhl has been shown to regulate tissue differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, migration, cytoskeletal organization  <cit> , and recently, to play a role in carcinogenesis through a tgf-β-like signaling pathway  <cit> . four and a half lim domains  <dig>  is a member of this family and has likewise been implicated in skeletal muscle development  <cit>  as well as in the pulmonary vascular remodeling underlying pulmonary hypertension  <cit> . interestingly, fhl <dig> is downregulated in many types of solid malignancies and it exhibits tumor suppressor activity  <cit> . among the splice variants described for fhl <dig>  in our study the expression of two of them, fhl <dig> and fhl1b, was identified in lung samples. in agreement with previous reports, clear downregulation in the expression of the fhl <dig> gene was detected in lung cancer specimens. more importantly, we determined that the downregulation of fhl <dig> is significantly higher than that of fhl1b. the two proteins are identical over the first three lim domains but fhl1b contains a distinct c-terminus  with three potential bipartite nuclear localization signals, a putative nuclear export sequence, and a binding motif for the transcription factor rbp-j  <cit> . whereas fhl <dig> is mainly located at focal adhesions, fhl1b is predominantly a nuclear protein and has unique physiological functions, including the regulation of notch signaling through its association with rbp-j  <cit> . notch signaling profoundly influences the regulation of tumor progression, specifically, tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis  <cit> .

mlph is a member of the synaptotagmin-like protein family and is involved in the transport of melanosomes  <cit> . these lysosome-related organelles are specialized in the synthesis and distribution of melanin. mlph is an essential member of the melanosome trafficking complex, acting as a link between rab27a and myosin va  <cit> . it may also be involved in the trafficking of epithelial na + channel in cells of the collecting duct of the kidney  <cit> . mlph contains an n-terminal slp homology domain  involved in binding to rab27a, a myosin-binding domain  in its middle region, and a c-terminal actin-binding domain . here, we demonstrated that lung tissue expresses at least two isoforms of mlph, one with and one without exon  <dig>  skipping of this exon generates a protein  <dig> amino acids shorter than the normal protein, without affecting any of the three characterized functional domains. in lung tumors, there is specific downregulation of the isoform containing exon  <dig> 

the recently identified susd <dig> is a single-pass type i membrane protein with an extracellular portion that contains somatomedin b, amop, von willebrand factor type d, and sushi/ccp/scr domains  <cit> . although its physiological function is still unknown, overexpression of susd <dig> is thought to suppress tumorigenicity  <cit> . in agreement with this postulated role for the protein, we observed reduced expression of susd <dig> in lung cancer tissues. interestingly, intron retention was frequently detected between the last exons of the mrna. inclusion of intronic sequences within an mrna is termed exonization. although this modification is the rarest type of alternative splicing found in normal cells, exonization events in cancer cells are frequent and may be associated with impairments in splicing regulatory factors  <cit> . the exonization of introns affects the extracellular portion of susd <dig> in that the translation of intron  <dig> introduces a premature stop codon which disrupts the von willebrand factor type d domain at amino acid  <dig>  exonization of intron  <dig> generates a protein whose last  <dig> amino acids are substituted by  <dig> new amino acids . translation of intron  <dig> generates a protein with a new sequence of  <dig> amino acids from position  <dig> , while retention of intron  <dig> introduces a premature stop codon, eliminating seven amino acids at the c-terminal end.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed and tested a novel platform for high-throughput analysis of alternative splicing events in biological samples. the application of this methodology will aid in understanding the functional relevance of splice variants in pathological conditions and facilitate the identification of new biomarkers and targets for therapy. to prove the usefulness of this platform, this methodology was used to identify cancer-associated splice variants in lung cancer. differentially expressed splice variants of four genes were identified, with potential utility in the diagnosis of lung cancer. additional work is in progress to analyze the relevance of these newly characterized cancer-associated isoforms as well as to validate additional candidates from data obtained in the splice array.
