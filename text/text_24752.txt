BACKGROUND
the recent advent of high density arrays of oligonucleotides and cdnas has had a deep impact on biological and medical research. indeed, the new technology enables the acquisition of data that is proving to be fundamental in many areas of the biological sciences, ranging from the understanding of complex biological systems to clinical diagnosis .

due to the large number of genes involved in each experiment, cluster analysis is a very useful exploratory technique for identifying genes that exhibit similar expression patterns, which may highlight groups of functionally related genes. this leads, in turn, to two well established and rich research areas. one deals with the design of new clustering algorithms and the other with the design of new internal validation measures that should assess the biological relevance of the clustering solutions found. despite the vast amount of knowledge available in those two areas in the general data mining literature  <cit> , gene expression data provide unique challenges, in particular with respect to internal validation measures. indeed, they must predict how many clusters are really present in a dataset, an already difficult task, made even worse by the fact that the estimation must be sensible enough to capture the inherent biological structure of functionally related genes. despite their potentially important role, both the use of classic internal validation measures and the design of new ones, specific for microarray data, do not seem to have great prominence in bioinformatics, where attention is mostly given to clustering algorithms. the excellent survey by handl et al.  <cit>  is a big step forward in making the study of those techniques a central part of both research and practice in bioinformatics, since it provides both a technical presentation as well as valuable general guidelines about their use for post-genomic data analysis. although much remains to be done, it is, nevertheless, an initial step.

for instance, in the general data mining literature, there are several studies, e.g.,  <cit> , aimed at establishing the intrinsic, as well as the relative, merit of a measure. to this end, the two relevant questions are:

 what is the precision of a measure, i.e., its ability to predict the correct number of clusters in a data set? that is usually established by comparing the number of clusters predicted by the measure against the number of clusters in the gold solution of several datasets, the gold solution being a partition of the dataset in classes that can be trusted to be correct, i.e., distinct groups of functionally related genes. a more precise explanation of the meaning of gold solution in our setting is provided when we present the datasets used for our experiments in the results and discussion section.

 among a collection of measures, which is more accurate, less algorithm-dependent, etc.,?. precision versus the use of computational resources, primarily execution time, would be an important discriminating factor.

although those classic studies are also of great relevance for bioinformatics, there is an acute need for analogous studies conducted on internal measures introduced recently and specifically designed for analysis of microarray data. we address both types of questions for several particularly prominent such measures, characterized by the fact that, for their prediction, they make use of nothing more than the dataset available: clest  <cit> , consensus  <cit> , fom  <cit>  gap  <cit>  and me  <cit> . because of their simplicity and computational efficiency, we also study wcss  <cit>  and kl  <cit> . the heuristic method supporting the use of wcss as an internal measure has roots in the statistics community folklore  <cit> .

initial studies of the mentioned measures, in connection with both questions  and , have been done, primarily, in the papers in which they were originally proposed. our study carries further those studies by providing more focused information about using those measures for the analysis of gene expression data. for question , our analysis provides further insights into the properties of the mentioned measures, with particular attention to time. for question , we provide the first comparative analysis involving all of those measures that accounts for both precision and time. this is particularly relevant in regard to the "resampling-based" methods, i.e., clest, consensus and me. in fact,  those three measures are excellent representatives of methods in the class ;  dudoit and fridlyand mention that it would be desirable to relate clest and me but no comparison seems to be available in the literature;  although it is quite common to include clest and gap in comparative analysis for novel measures, consensus is hardly considered, although our experiments show that it should definitely be included. based on our analysis, we add to the state of the art valuable guidelines for the choice of which of the seven measures to use for microarray data analysis. moreover, we also provide, as an additional contribution for fom, gap and wcss, several good and fast approximation algorithms, i.e., the new algorithms have the same predictive power of the mentioned measures, while being faster. particularly relevant is the approximation algorithm we propose for gap. it is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the original measure and with a better prediction power.

RESULTS
experimental setup
data sets
technically speaking, a gold solution for a dataset is a partition of the data in a number of classes known a priori. membership in a class is established by assigning the appropriate class label to each element. in less formal terms, the partition of the dataset in classes is based on external knowledge that leaves no ambiguity on the actual number of classes and on the membership of elements to classes. although there exist real microarray datasets for which such an a priori division is known, in a few previous studies of relevance here, a more relaxed criterion has been adopted to allow also datasets with high quality partitions that have been inferred by analyzing the data, i.e., by the use of internal knowledge via data analysis tools such as clustering algorithms. in strict technical terms, there is a difference between the two types of "gold solutions". for their datasets, dudoit and fridlyand elegantly make clear that difference and we closely follow their approach here.

each dataset is a matrix, in which each row corresponds to an element to be clustered and each column to an experimental condition. the six datasets, together with the acronyms used in this paper, are reported next. for conciseness, we mention only some relevant facts about them. the interested reader can find additional information in handl et al., for the leukemia dataset, in dudoit and fridlyand for the lymphoma and nci <dig> datasets and in di gesú et al.  <cit> , for the remaining ones. in all of the referenced papers, the datasets were used for validation studies. moreover, in those papers, the interested reader can find additional pointers to validation studies using the same datasets.

cns rat
the dataset gives the expression levels of  <dig> genes during rat central nervous system development. it is a  <dig> ×  <dig> data matrix studied by wen et al.  <cit> . there are no a priori known classes for this dataset, but the analysis by wen et al. suggests a partition of the genes into six classes, four of which are composed of biologically, functionally-related, genes. we take that to be the gold solution, which is the same one used for the validation of fom.

leukemia
the dataset is the one used by handl et al. in their survey of computational cluster validation to illustrate the use of some measures. it is a  <dig> ×  <dig> data matrix, where each row corresponds to a patient with acute leukemia and each column to a gene. for this dataset, there is an a priori partition into three classes and we take that as the gold solution.

lymphoma
the dataset comes from the study of alizadeh et al.  <cit>  on the three most common adult lymphoma tumors. it is an  <dig> ×  <dig> matrix, where each row corresponds to a tissue sample and each column to a gene. there is an a priori partition into three classes and we take that as the gold solution. the dataset has been obtained from the original microarray experiments as described by dudoit and fridlyand.

nci60
this dataset originates from a microarray study in gene expression variation among the sixty cell lines of national cancer institute anti-cancer drug screen  <cit> . it is a  <dig> ×  <dig> data matrix, where each row corresponds to a cell line and each column to a gene. there is an a priori partition of the dataset into eight classes and we take that as the gold solution. the dataset has been obtained from the original microarray experiments as described by dudoit and fridlyand.

yeast
the dataset is part of that studied by spellman et al.  <cit>  and it is a  <dig> ×  <dig> data matrix. there are no a priori known classes for this dataset, but the analysis by spellman et al. suggests a partition of the genes into five functionally-related classes. we take that to be the gold solution, which has been used by shamir amd sharan for a case study on performance of clustering algorithms  <cit> .

pbm
the dataset contains  <dig> cdnas with a fingerprint of  <dig> oligos. this gives a  <dig> ×  <dig> data matrix. according to hartuv et al.  <cit> , the cdnas in the dataset originated from  <dig> distinct genes, i.e., the a priori classes are known. the partition of the dataset into  <dig> groups was obtained by lab experiments at novartis in vienna. following that study, we take those classes and the class labels assigned to the elements as the gold solution. it was used by hartuv et al. to test their clustering algorithm.

clustering algorithms and their stability
we use a suite of clustering algorithms. among the hierarchical methods  <cit>  hier-a , hier-c , and hier-s . moreover, we use k-means  <cit> , both in the version that starts the clustering from a random partition of the data and in the version where it takes as part of the input an initial partition produced by one of the chosen hierarchical methods. the acronyms of those versions are k-means-r, k-means-a, k-means-c and k-means-s, respectively.

we also point out that k-means-r is a randomized algorithm that may provide different answers on the same input dataset. that might make the values of many of the measures we are studying depend critically on the particular execution of the algorithm. such a dependence is important for wcss, kl and fom. for those measures and their approximations, we have repeated five times the computation of the relevant curves, on all datasets, with k-means-r. we observed only negligible differences from run to run. therefore, in what follows, all reported results refer to a single run of the algorithms, except for the cases in which an explicit monte carlo simulation is required.

similarity/distance functions
all of our algorithms use euclidean distance in order to assess similarity of single elements to be clustered. such a choice is natural and conservative, as we now explain. it places all algorithms in the same position without introducing biases due to distance function performance, rather than to the algorithm. moreover, time course data have been properly standardized , so that euclidean distance would not be penalized on those data. this is standard procedure, e.g.,  <cit> , for those data. the results we obtain are conservative since, assuming that one has a provably much better similarity/distance function, one can only hope to get better estimates than ours . as it is clear from the upcoming discussion and conclusions, such better estimates will cause no dramatic change in the general picture of our findings. the choice is also natural, in view of the debate regarding the identification of a proper similarity/distance function for clustering gene expression data and the number of such measures available. the state of the art as well some relevant progress in the identification of such measure is well presented in  <cit> .

hardware
all experiments for the assessment of the precision of each measure were performed in part on several state-of-the-art pcs and in part on a 64-bit amd athlon  <dig>  ghz bi-processor with  <dig> gb of main memory running windows server  <dig>  all the timing experiments reported were performed on the bi-processor, using one processor per run. the usage of different machines for the experimentation was deemed necessary in order to complete the full set of experiments in a reasonable amount of time. indeed, as detailed later, some measures require weeks to complete execution on yeast and pbm, the two largest datasets we have used. we also point out that all the operating systems supervising the computations have a  <dig> bits precision.

question -intrinsic precision of the internal measures
in this section we present experiments with the aim to shed some light on question . as discussed in the methods section, for most measures, the prediction of the "optimal" number k* of clusters is based on the visual inspection of curves and histograms. for conciseness, we provide all the relevant material in the supplementary material web site  <cit>  . here we limit ourselves to produce summary tables, based on our analysis of the relevant curves and experiments. we report a separate table for each measure, . we anticipate that the next subsection addresses the relative merits of each measure and a global summary table is reported, but only for the best performers. that is, for each measure, we report the experimental parameters  only if in that setting the prediction of k* has been reasonably close to the gold solution  in at least four of the six datasets we have used. table  <dig> is a summary of those results. the reader interested mainly in a comparative analysis of the various measures may wish to skip this subsection.

a summary of the results for wcss on all algorithms and on all datasets. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by wcss, while the remaining four indicate the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment. cells with a dash indicate that wcss did not give any useful indication.

a summary of the results for kl on all algorithms and on all datasets. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by kl, while the remaining four indicate the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment.

a summary of the results of g-gap, on all algorithms and on all datasets. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by the measure, while the remaining four indicate the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment.

a summary of the results for clest on all algorithms and the first four datasets, with use of three external indexes. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by clest, while the remaining one indicates the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment. for pbm, the experiments were terminated due to their high computational demand . therefore, the resulting column is omitted from the table. for the leukemia, nci <dig> and lymphoma datasets, the timing experiments are not reported because incomparable with those of cns rat and of the other measures. the corresponding columns are eliminated from the table.

a summary of the results for consensus on all algorithms and the first five datasets. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by consensus, while the remaining four indicate the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment. for pbm, the experiments were terminated due to their high computational demand and the corresponding column has been removed from the table.

a summary of the results for fom on all algorithms and on all datasets. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by fom, while the remaining four indicate the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment. cells with a dash indicate that fom did not give any useful indication.

a summary of the results for g-fom on all algorithms and on all datasets. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by g-fom, while the remaining four indicate the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment. cells with a dash indicate that g-fom did not give any useful indication.

a summary of the results for diff-fom on all algorithms and on all datasets. the columns under the label precision indicate the number of clusters predicted by diff-fom, while the remaining four indicate the timing in milliseconds for the execution of the corresponding experiment. cells with a dash indicate that diff-fom did not give any useful indication.

a summary of the best performances obtained by each measure. the pbm dataset has been excluded because no measure gave useful information about its cluster structure.

moreover, in what follows, for each cell in a table displaying precision results, a number in a circle with a black background indicates a prediction in agreement with the number of classes in the dataset, while a number in a circle with a white background indicates a prediction that differs, in absolute value, by  <dig> from the number of classes in the dataset; when the prediction is one cluster, i.e. gap statistics, this symbol rule is not applied because the prediction means no cluster structure in the data; a number not in a circle indicates the remaining predictions. as detailed in each table, cells with a dash indicate that either the experiment was stopped, because of its high computational demand, or that the measure gives no useful indication. the timing results are reported only on the four smallest datasets. indeed, for yeast and pbm, the computational demand is such on some measures that either they had to be stopped or they took weeks to complete. for those two datasets, the experiments we report were done using more than one machine.

wcss and its approximations
for each algorithm, each of the wcss approximations , and each dataset, we have computed wcss for a number of cluster values in the range  <cit> . the relevant plots are in the figures section at the supplementary material web site: fig. s <dig> for the k-means algorithms and wcss approximations and fig. s <dig> for the hierarchical algorithms.

as outlined in the methods section, given the relevant wcss curve, k* is predicted as the abscissa closest to the "knee" in that curve. the values resulting from the application of this methodology to the relevant plots are reported in table  <dig> together with timing results for the relevant datasets.

we have that wcss performs well with k-means-c and k-means-a, on the first five datasets, while it gives no reasonably correct indication on pbm. it is a poor performer with the other clustering algorithms. those facts give strong indication that wcss is algorithm-dependent. finally, the failure of wcss, with all algorithms, to give a good prediction for pbm indicates that wcss may not be of any use on large datasets having a large number of clusters.

as for its approximations, it is evident that they perform better than the original wcss curve . that is, they are among the best performers in table  <dig>  moreover, depending on the dataset, they are from a few times to an order of magnitude faster than the k-means algorithms.

overall, the best performers are k-means-c and wcss-r-r <dig>  the relative results are reported in table  <dig> for comparison with the performance of the other measures.

kl
following the same experimental set-up of wcss, we have computed the kl measure, for each dataset and each algorithm. the results, summarized in table  <dig>  are rather disappointing: the measure provides some reliable indication, accross algorithms, only on the leukemia and the lymphoma datasets. due to such a poor performance, no results are reported in table  <dig> for comparison with the performance of the other measures.

gap and its geometric approximation
for each dataset and each clustering algorithm, we compute three versions of gap, namely gap-ps, gap-pc and gap-pr, for a number of cluster values in the range  <cit> . gap-ps uses the poisson null model, gap-pc the poisson null model aligned with the principal components of the data while gap-pr uses the permutational null model . for each of them, we perform a monte carlo simulation,  <dig> steps, in which the measure returns an estimated number of clusters for each step. each simulation step is based on the generation of  <dig> data matrices from the null model used by the measure. at the end of each monte carlo simulation, the number with the majority of estimates is taken as the predicted number of clusters. occasionally, there are ties and we report both numbers. the relevant histograms are displayed at the supplementary material web site : figs. s3-s <dig> for gap-ps, figs. s9-s <dig> for gap-pc and figs. s14-s <dig> for gap-pr. the results are summarized in table t <dig> at the supplementary material web page . for pbm and gap-pc, each experiment was terminated after a week, since no substantial progress was being made towards its completion.

the results for gap are somewhat disappointing, as table t <dig> shows, and therefore given only for completeness at the supplementary material web site. however, a few comments are in order, the first one regarding the null models. tibshirani et al. find experimentally that, on simulated data, gap-pc is the clear winner over gap-ps . our results show that, as the dataset size increases, gap-pc incurs into a severe time performance degradation, due to the repeated data transformation step. moreover, on the smaller datasets, no null model seems to have the edge. some of the results are also somewhat puzzling. in particular, although the datasets have cluster structure, many algorithms return an estimate of k* =  <dig>  i.e., no cluster structure in the data. an analogous situation was reported by monti et al. in their study, gap-ps returned k* =  <dig> on two artificial datasets. fortunately, an analysis of the corresponding gap curve showed that indeed the first maximum was at k* =  <dig> but a local maximum was also present at the correct number of classes, in each dataset. we have performed an analogous analysis of the relevant gap curves to find that, in analogy with monti et al., also in our case most curves show a local maximum at or very close to the number of classes in each dataset, following the maximum at k* =  <dig>  an example curve is given in fig.  <dig>  from the above, one can conclude that inspection of the gap curves and domain knowledge can greatly help in disambiguating the case k* =  <dig>  we also report that experiments conducted by dudoit and fridlyand and, independently by yan and ye  <cit> , show that gap tends to overestimate the correct number of clusters, although this does not seem to be the case for our datasets and algorithms. the above considerations seem to suggest that the automatic rule for the prediction of k* based on gap is rather weak.

as for g-gap, the geometric approximation of gap, we have computed, for each algorithm and each dataset, the corresponding wcss curve and its approximations in the interval  <cit> . we have then applied the rule described in the methods section to get the value of k*. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  as it is evident from the table, the overall performance of g-gap is clearly superior to gap, irrespective of the null model. moreover, depending on the dataset, it is from two to three orders of magnitude faster. the best performers are k-means-r and wcss-r-r <dig>  the relative results are reported in table  <dig> for comparison with the performance of the other measures.

clest
for cns rat and yeast and each clustering algorithm, we compute clest for a number of cluster values in the range  <cit>  while, for leukemia, nci <dig> and lymphoma, the ranges  <cit> ,  <cit>  and  <cit>  are used, respectively, due to the small size of the datasets. moreover, although experiments have been started with pbm, no substantial progress was made after a week of execution and, for each clustering algorithm, the corresponding experiment was terminated. following the same experimental set-up of dudoit and fridlyand, for each cluster value k, we perform  <dig> resampling steps and  <dig> iterations. in each step, 66% of the rows of the data matrix are extracted, uniformly and at random, to create a learning set, to be given to the clustering algorithm to be clustered in k groups. as one of its input parameters, clest requires the use of an external index e to establish the level of agreement between two partitions of a dataset. we use each of the following: the fm index  <cit> , adj   <cit>  and f   <cit> .

the results are summarized in table  <dig>  where the timing results for the leukemia, nci <dig> and lymphoma datasets were excluded since the experiments were performed on a smaller interval of cluster values with respect to cns rat. this latter interval is the standard one we are using to make consistent comparisons across measures and algorithms.

the results show that clest has severe time demand limitations on large datasets. it also seems to achieve a better performance, accross algorithms with adj and f. moreover, it is clearly algorithm-dependent, with k-means-r being the best performer with both fm and f. those results are reported in table  <dig> for comparison with the performance of the other measures.

me
for each of the first five datasets and each clustering algorithm, we compute me for a number of cluster values in the range  <cit> . following the same experimental set-up of ben-hur et al., for each cluster value k, we perform  <dig> iterations. in each step, we compute two datasets to be given to the algorithm to be clustered in k groups. each dataset is created by extracting uniformly and at random 80% of the rows. the prediction of k* is based on the plot of the corresponding histograms, as illustrated in the methods section. as for the external indexes, we have used the same three used for clest. the histograms obtained from such an experimentation are reported at the supplementary material web site in figs. s20-s <dig>  as for pbm, the computations were stopped because of their computational demand. a summary of the results is given in table t <dig> at the supplementary material web site for completeness only. indeed, the performance of me was rather disappointing, with the exception of leukemia and lymphoma, accross algorithms and external indexes.

consensus
for each of the first five datasets and each clustering algorithm, we compute consensus for a number of cluster values in the range  <cit> . following the same experimental set-up of monti et al., for each cluster value k, we perform  <dig> resampling steps. in each step, 80% of the rows of the matrix are extracted uniformly and at random to create a new dataset, to be given to the clustering algorithm to be clustered in k groups. the prediction of k* is based on the plot of two curves, Δ and Δ', as a function of the number k of clusters. both curves are defined in the methods section. as suggested by monti et al., the first curve is suitable for hierarchical algorithms while the second suits non-hierarchical ones. we did not experiment for pbm, since consensus was very slow . contrary to monti et al. indication, we have computed the Δ curve for all algorithms on the first five datasets, for reasons that will be self-evident shortly. the corresponding plots are available at the supplementary material web site  as figs. s125-s <dig>  we have also computed the Δ curve for the k-means algorithms, on the same datasets. since those curves are nearly identical to the Δ ones, they are omitted. in order to predict the number of clusters in the datasets, we have used, for all curves, the rule reported and explained in the methods section: take as k* the abscissa corresponding to the smallest non-negative value where the curve starts to stabilize; that is, no big variation in the curve takes place from that point on. we performed such an analysis on the Δ curves and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  together with the corresponding timing results.

as for the precision of consensus, all algorithms perform well, except for hier-s. the results also show that the Δ curve may be adequate for all algorithms. this contradicts the recommendation by monti et al. and a brief explanation of the reason is given in the methods section.

in conclusion, consensus seems to be limited by time demand that makes it not applicable to large datasets. however, on small and medium sized datasets, it is remarkably precise across algorithms. in fact, except for hier-s, the performance of consensus is among the best and reported in table  <dig> for comparison with the performance of the other measures.

fom and its extensions and approximations
for each algorithm, each of the fom approximations  and each dataset, we have followed the same methodology outlined for wcss. the relevant plots are in figs. s135-s <dig> at the supplementary material web site . the values resulting from the application of this methodology to the relevant plots are reported in table  <dig> together with timing results for the relevant datasets. using the same experimental setting, we have also computed the k* predicted by g-fom and diff-fom, the extensions of fom proposed here. the results are in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. as those results show, g-fom did not perform as well as the other two. moreover, both fom and diff-fom are algorithm-dependent and give no useful indication on large datasets. as for the approximations of fom, i.e., fom-r-r <dig>  fom-r-r <dig>  fom-r-r <dig>  they compare very well with the k-means algorithms in terms of precision and they are an order of magnitude faster. the best performing methods, both for fom and diff-fom, are reported in table  <dig> for comparison with the performance of the other measures.

question : relative merits of each measure
the discussion here refers to table  <dig>  it is evident that the k-means algorithms have superior performance with respect to the hierarchical ones, although hier-a has an impressive and unmatched performance with consensus. the approximation algorithms we have proposed for both wcss and fom are among the best performers. g-gap and diff-fom also guarantee, with a proper choice of algorithms, a good performance. in particular, g-gap is orders of magnitude faster than gap and more precise.

however, consensus and fom stand out as being the most stable across algorithms. in particular, consensus has a remarkable stability performance accross algorithms and datasets.

for large datasets such as pbm, our experiments show that all the measures are severely limited due either to speed  or to precision as well as speed . in our view, this fact stresses even more the need for good data filtering and dimensionality reduction techniques since they may help reduce such datasets to sizes manageable by the measures we have studied.

it is also obvious that, when one takes computer time into account, there is a hierarchy of measures, with wcss being the fastest and consensus the slowest. we see from table  <dig> that there is a natural division of methods in two groups: slow  and fast . since there are at least two orders of magnitude of difference in time performance between the two groups, it seems reasonable to use one of the fast methods, for instance g-gap, to limit the search interval for k*. one can then use consensus in the narrowed interval. although it may seem paradoxical, despite its precision performance, fom does not seem to be competitive in this scenario. indeed, it is only marginally better than the best performing of wcss and g-gap but at least an order of magnitude slower in time.

when one does not account for time, consensus seems to be the clear winner since it offers good precision performance accross algorithms at virtually the same price in terms of time performance.

CONCLUSIONS
prior to this research, all the measures we have considered here were perceived as adequate for inferring the number of clusters in a dataset, in particular for gene expression data. this study provides further insights into the relative merits of each of the measures we have considered, from which more accurate and useful guidelines for their use can be inferred. moreover, extensions and approximations of those measures have also been proposed and they turn out to be competitive, both in time and precision. we have also offered a comparison among three resampling-based prediction methods that is not available elsewhere in the literature.

overall, consensus results to be the method of choice, although the fast algorithms may be of great help in limiting the search interval for k*.

it is also to be stressed that no measure performed well on large datasets. in view of this finding, data reduction techniques such as filtering and dimensionality reduction become even more important for class discovery in microarray data. another promising avenue of research is to design fast approximation algorithms for the computation of the slowest measures, in particular consensus. finally, we remark that gap, clest, me and consensus have various parameters that a user needs to specify. those choices may affect both time performance and precision. yet, no experimental study, addressing the issue of parameter selection for those methods, seems to be available in the literature.
