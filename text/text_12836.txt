BACKGROUND
notch transmembrane receptors are important regulators of cell fate determination in numerous cell types  <cit> . notch receptors in drosophila and mammals are covalently modified with o-fucose on many epidermal growth factor-like  repeats of the extracellular domain  <cit> . an important o-fucose site resides in epidermal growth factor-like repeat  <dig>  which, together with egf <dig>  is required for canonical notch ligand binding to drosophila notch  <cit>  and to mammalian notch <dig>  <cit> . a point mutation that precludes the addition of fucose to egf <dig> in drosophila notch results in enhanced binding of both delta and serrate notch ligands, and a hyperactive notch that is refractory to fringe  <cit> . however, the same mutation  in cultured mammalian cells gives markedly reduced signaling in a notch reporter signaling assay  <cit> , predicting a notch <dig> null phenotype in vivo. surprisingly however, homozygous notch112f/12f mice are viable and fertile, but exhibit retarded growth and mild defects in t cell development in the thymus  <cit> , consistent with weak notch <dig> signaling. notch1+/12f heterozygotes are indistinguishable from wild type in terms of growth and t cell development. however, compound heterozygotes carrying notch112f and the inactive notch1lbd allele, which lacks the ligand binding domain and generates an inactive ~ <dig> kda notch <dig> receptor at the cell surface, are not born  <cit> . therefore notch112f is a hypomorphic allele in mammals and the o-fucose glycan in the ligand binding domain is required for optimal notch <dig> signaling. homozygous notch1lbd/lbd embryos die at ~e <dig>   <cit>  with an indistinguishable phenotype compared to notch <dig> null embryos  described by others  <cit> . heterozygous notch1+/lbd and notch1+/tm1con mice are viable and fertile whereas notch112f/lbd compound heterozygotes die between e <dig>  and e <dig> , significantly later than either notch1lbd/lbd  <cit>  or notch <dig> null embryos  <cit>  that do not express notch <dig>  <cit> .

the availability of these notch <dig> mutant alleles suggested a genetic approach to determining effects of varying notch <dig> signaling strength. the notch1lbd mutation generates a non-functional but cell surface-expressed notch <dig> that cannot signal  <cit> . notch1tm1con lacks notch <dig> on the cell surface due to the absence of its transmembrane domain  <cit> . notch1in <dig> homozygous embryos have no notch <dig> transcripts  <cit>  and an indistinguishable phenotype from notch1tm1con homozygotes which lack notch <dig> based on western analyses  <cit> . notch1+/- heterozygotes carrying either of the notch <dig> null alleles exhibit notch <dig> signaling defects in certain cell types, an effect attributed to notch <dig> haploinsufficiency rather than to a dominant negative effect in notch1tm1con  <cit> . in this paper we compare embryogenesis and vasculogenesis in compound heterozygotes expressing the hypomorphic notch112f allele with either the inactive notch1lbd allele  <cit>  or the notch1tm1con null allele  <cit> .

RESULTS
notch signaling in notch112f/lbd compound heterozygous es cells
the notch112f and notchlbd alleles investigated here are diagrammed in fig. 1a and 1b and their identification by pcr genotyping is shown in fig. 1c. previous studies showed that notch112f/lbd compound heterozygotes die by ~e <dig>   <cit> . to examine notch ligand binding and the strength of notch signaling in more detail, es cells were derived from notch112f/lbd compound heterozygous blastocysts and compared to es cells derived from notch112f/12f and notch1lbd/lbd homozygous blastocysts and wild type es cells . all cell lines bound the anti-notch <dig> extracellular domain mab 8g <dig> equivalently, and therefore expressed the various notch <dig> molecules similarly at the cell surface . each mutant line exhibited a decrease in the low level of soluble delta <dig> binding observed with wild type es cells . binding of delta <dig> is not reduced to zero even in notch <dig> null es cells because of the presence of notch <dig>  notch <dig> and notch <dig>  <cit> . notch signaling was analysed in co-culture assays with l cells or l cells expressing full length delta <dig> or jagged <dig> ligand. this reporter assay revealed a graded reduction in notch signaling with notch112f/12f >notch112f/lbd >notch1lbd/lbd es cells . this graded response was also observed by western analysis using notch <dig> antibody val <dig>  <cit>  which detects the ~ <dig> kda notch <dig> fragment generated by γ-secretase complex cleavage of notch <dig>  the level of activated notch <dig> in notch112f/lbd es cells was less than in notch112f/12f es cells, which was lower than in control es cells, while notch1lbd/lbd es cells had undetectable levels of activated notch <dig> . nevertheless, all es cell populations, including notch1lbd/lbd es cells, expressed equivalent levels of full-length notch <dig> . taken together, these data indicate that notch112f and notch1lbd expression and transit to the cell surface were similar to wild type notch <dig>  but notch <dig> signaling was reduced in mutant cells: notch112f signaling was sightly less than wild type; signaling from the combination of notch112f and notch1lbd was further reduced, and signaling by notch1lbd alone was essentially absent. previous experiments have shown that notch1lbd/lbd and notch1in32/in <dig> es cells which lack notch <dig>  <cit> , are equally deficient in delta1-fc binding and notch <dig> signaling  <cit> .

embryogenesis in notch112f/lbd compound heterozygous embryos
embryonic development was compared between notch112f/12f, notch112f/lbd and notch1lbd/lbd embryos. at e <dig>  notch112f/lbd embryos formed 17- <dig> somites compared to 23- <dig> somites in notch112f/12f embryos, the same as notch1+/+ embryos, and 13- <dig> somites in notch1lbd/lbd embryos  <cit> , the same as notch1tm1con null embryos  <cit>  . compared to notch112f/12f and notch1+/12f embryos, notch112f/lbd embryos also showed severely defective vasculogenesis in yolk sac at e <dig> , similar to notch1lbd/lbd yolk sac. by contrast, notch112f/lbd embryos at e <dig>  and e <dig>  exhibited milder defects in development than notch1lbd/lbd embryos  <cit>  , although the ballooning of the pericardial sac and defective heart development were severe, and similar to mutants globally defective in notch signaling such as mutants lacking pofut <dig>  <cit> , rbpjk  <cit>  or presenilins  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these data indicate that two copies of notch112f do not noticeably affect mouse embryogenesis at a gross level, whereas a single copy of notch112f with notch1lbd support embryonic development ~ <dig> - <dig>  days longer than embryos with two copies of notch1lbd.

somites were counted in embryos of notch1+/+, notch1+/12f, notch112f/12f, notch112f/lbd, notch112f/tm1con and notch1lbd/lbd at e <dig> . *somite numbers in notch1tm1con/tm1con embryos are from conlon et al.  <cit> .

vasculogenesis in yolk sac appears to require stronger notch <dig> signaling than in the embryo
notch <dig> signaling is critical for vasculogenesis during mouse embryogenesis  <cit> . loss of notch <dig> in embryos  <cit>  or in endothelial cells  <cit>  causes embryonic lethality with severe vascularization defects in yolk sac, placenta and embryo. blood that had leaked from the heart and blood vessels was apparent in notch112f/lbd embryos . vascular organization in embryos was examined by staining with anti-pecam <dig> . notch112f/12f embryos  did not exhibit any apparent defects in brain, heart or intersomitic vascularization compared to notch1+/12f embryos. notch112f/lbd embryos exhibited somewhat disorganized vascularization in embryos, especially in the main trunk of the anterior cardinal vein, the vascular network of the head and heart, and in intersomitic vessels . notch1lbd/lbd embryos exhibited severe defects in vascularization . therefore, the extensive vascularization in e <dig>  and older notch112f/lbd embryos appears to be well supported by the level of notch <dig> signaling provided by the notch112f allele. considering that the vascular defects in yolk sac of compound heterozygous notch112f/lbd and homozygous notch1lbd/lbd embryos were similarly severe, the comparatively milder defects in notch112f/lbd embryos indicated that notch <dig> signaling from a single copy of notch112f, while not sufficient to support vascularization in yolk sac at e <dig> , is able to support a high level of vascularization in e <dig>  embryos. it seems that vascularization in yolk sac requires stronger notch <dig> signaling than in the embryo.

notch <dig> target gene expression in e <dig>  yolk sac versus embryo
whereas vascularization was severly affected in both yolk sac and embryo of notch1lbd/lbd embryos, only the yolk sac of notch112f/lbd compound heterozygous embryos exhibited extremely defective vascularization. to investigate further, the expression of vasculogensis-related and notch <dig> target genes was examined by real-time pcr using total rna isolated from e <dig>  notch112f/lbd and notch1+/12f yolk sacs and embryo heads. the relative expression levels of pecam <dig> and vegf were increased in notch112f/lbd yolk sacs and embryos, and vegfr <dig> expression was increased in notch112f/lbd embryo heads . therefore loss of notch <dig> signaling upregulated transcription of the pecam <dig>  vegf and vegfr <dig> genes. interestingly, the increased expression of vegf and vegfr <dig> was greater in notch112f/lbd embryos, consistent with the relative strength of notch <dig> signaling being greater in yolk sac. expression of the notch <dig> target genes hes <dig>  hey <dig> and hey <dig> was reduced in notch112f/lbd yolk sac , but the level of hes <dig> transcripts was not changed . in embryos, only the expression of hes <dig> was significantly reduced compared to control. the expression of ang <dig>  tie <dig> and ephrin-b <dig> which are involved in angiogenesis, as well the expression of notch <dig> itself, were not changed in notch112f/lbd yolk sac or embryos . the fact that the increase in vegf and vegfr <dig> transcripts was more in embryo head than yolk sac , and the fact that the reduction in notch target gene expression was greater in yolk sac than embryo head, correlated generally with notch <dig> signal strength and the greater severity of vascularization defects in yolk sac versus embryo head.

notch112f may function to birth in the absence of notch1lbd
the severity of the notch112f/lbd phenotype suggested an interaction between notch112f and notch1lbd that interfered with signaling by notch112f. in this case, compound heterozygous embryos expressing a notch112f allele and a notch <dig> null allele might be expected to have a milder phenotype than notch112f/lbd embryos. notch112f/12f mice were crossed with notch1+/tm1con heterozygotes and embryos were examined at e <dig>  and later . some notch112f/tm1con embryos died between e <dig>  and e <dig>  with similar defects to notch112f/lbd embryos. however, this is ~ <dig>  days later than observed with notch1tm1con/tm1con homozygous embryos who were mostly dead by e <dig>  <cit> . however, nearly one third of the notch112f/tm1con embryos developed beyond e <dig>  and died at various times during embryogenesis, including after birth . two notch112f/tm1con pups were found after birth, but none were observed after postnatal day  <dig> . somite numbers in notch112f/tm1con embryos varied from as low as notch112f/lbd embryos to as high as wild type embryos . taken together, these results indicate that notch112f receptors present at a 50% dose in vivo, generate stronger notch <dig> signaling than notch112f in combination with notch1lbd. this provides genetic evidence that notch112f and notch1lbd may functionally interact.

embryos , post-natal pups  and mice after weaning were genotyped from crosses of notch112f/12f female × notch1+/tm1con male or crosses of notch112f/12f female × notch1+/lbd male. the data from notch1+/12f × notch112f/lbd crosses were previously published  <cit>  but are included for ease of comparison.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we show that notch <dig> signaling is greatly reduced in notch112f/lbd es cells and compound heterozygous embryos, but is significantly greater than in notch1lbd/lbd es cells or homozygous embryos. the presence of the hypomorphic notch112f allele allows vasculogenesis to proceed further and embryos to survive ~ <dig> - <dig> days longer. the vascular system develops early during mammalian embryogenesis. initially, endothelial cell precursors differentiate and coalesce into a primitive network of undifferentiated blood vessels  in both the mammalian embryo and its extraembryonic membrane the yolk sac, in a process termed vasculogenesis  <cit> . subsequently, the primary vascular plexus is remodeled into a highly organized and functionally competent vascular network in a process termed angiogenesis  <cit> . these processes are controlled by several signaling molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor  and its receptors  <cit> , angiopoeitin  <dig> and its receptor tie <dig>  <cit> , ephrin-b ligands and ephb receptors  <cit> , tgfβ and its receptors  <cit> , and notch receptors and their ligands delta and jagged  <cit> . defects in vasculogenesis are one of the major reasons that notch <dig> null embryos die at mid-gestation  <cit> . conditional mutation of notch <dig> in vascular endothelial cells using the tie2-cre transgene showed that embryos lacking endothelial cell notch <dig> die at ~e <dig>  with profound vascular defects in placenta, yolk sac, and the embryo proper  <cit> . the notch <dig> target genes hey <dig> and hey <dig> are also essential for embryonic vascular development  <cit> . a requirement for notch signaling in the maintenance of vascular homestasis and the repression of endothelial cell proliferation is also indicated in adult mice by conditional deletion of rbp-jκ in endothelial cells  <cit> .

interestingly, notch112f/lbd embryos allowed us to observe that vasculogenesis is regulated to different extents in yolk sac and embryo by notch <dig> signaling. thus, vascular defects in notch112f/lbd yolk sac were as severe as in notch1lbd/lbd yolk sac, but vascular defects in notch112f/lbd embryo heads were comparatively mild. the vasculogenic phenotype of notch112f/lbd embryos was also milder than reported for jagged <dig> or notch <dig> or notch1/ <dig> null embryos  <cit> , reflecting the presence of a low level of notch <dig> signaling in notch112f/lbd compound heterozygotes. the reduced strength of notch <dig> signaling was responsible for defective artery development in delta-like  <dig>  heterozygous embryos  <cit> . hes <dig> and hey <dig> are notch <dig> target genes, and notch <dig> downregulates expression of hesr-1/hey <dig> thereby enhancing expression of its target gene vegfr <dig> in endothial cells  <cit> . in addition, vegf is upregulated six-fold in hey1/ <dig> double knock-out embryos  <cit> . notch <dig> has also been proposed to regulate vasculogenesis and angiogenesis via induction of ephrin-b <dig>  <cit>  and ang <dig>  <cit> , and suppression of vegfr-2/kdr  <cit> . consistent with this, we observed enhanced suppression of vegfr <dig> and vegf in notch112f/lbd yolk sac and embryo. however, we observed no change in the expression of ang <dig>  tie <dig>  ephrin-b <dig> or notch <dig> itself, although experiments in human endothelial cells indicate that ang <dig> and tie <dig> are notch <dig> target genes  <cit> . ephrin-b <dig> was reported to respond to notch <dig>  but not to notch <dig>  through delta-like  <dig> in differentiating huvec cells  <cit> , so it was perhaps not surprising that ephrin-b <dig> expression was unchanged in notch112f/lbd yolk sac or embryo. thus, decreased notch <dig> signaling may inhibit vascular development in yolk sac more than in embryos by inducing more vegf and vegfr <dig> through generating less hes <dig> and hey <dig> mrna in yolk sac.

the prolonged embryonic development supported by the hypomorphic notch112f allele was only ~ <dig> - <dig> days for notch112f/lbd embryos compared to notch1lbd/lbd  <cit> , or notch <dig> null embryos  <cit> . by contrast notch112f/12f, notch1+/lbd or notch1+/- heterozygotes are viable and fertile  <cit> . this suggests that notch1lbd may interfere with notch112f in a process termed negative complementation for abruptex notch mutants in drosophila  <cit> . the basis of negative complementation is most commonly attributed to the products of the mutant alleles interacting physically  <cit> . thus notch1lbd may either be dominant negative and inhibit notch112f activity, or may not form a functional dimer or higher oligomer with notch112f, if that is required for notch <dig> to function. we prefer the latter hypothesis because there is no evidence to date that notch1lbd behaves as a dominant negative in notch1+/lbd heterozygotes  <cit> . unfortunately, attempts to prove the existence of dimers or higher oligomers of notch <dig> expressed at endogenous levels have so far been unsuccessful and previous attempts came to opposite conclusions. while two groups found that overexpressed notch <dig> transfected into cultured cells may form dimers through the transmembrane domain or the extracellular domain egf repeats, one group concluded that dimerization is necessary for notch <dig> to signal  <cit> , while the other concluded that notch <dig> signals without the need for dimerization, and is present mainly as a monomer on the cell surface  <cit> . both studies characterized transiently-transfected notch <dig> expressed at much higher levels than endogenous notch <dig>  which might induce anomolous interactions.

if notch1lbd reduces the effective amount of notch112f to a level insufficient to sustain development, we reasoned that notch112f expressed in the context of a notch <dig> null background may function better. in fact, we found that a significant proportion of notch112f/tm1con embryos survived beyond e <dig>  and that some survived to birth. on the other hand, some compound heterozygous notch112f/tm1con embryos died at ~e <dig>  with similar defects to notch112f/lbd. this indicates that notch112f at a dose of 50% functions at a threshold of notch <dig> signaling strength that variably sustains embryogenesis through to birth - a stochastic effect or perhaps a genetic background effect, since notch1+/12f and notch1+/lbd mice were not extensively backcrossed to c57bl/ <dig>  nevertheless, the notch <dig> signal strength generated by a single copy of notch112f was intermediate between notch112f/12f and notch112f/lbd, revealing the importance of maintaining a certain level of notch <dig> signaling for mouse embryogenesis to proceed. fig.  <dig> summarizes these findings in a diagram which describes a mini-allelic series of available notch <dig> mutants. it includes the notch <dig> processing point mutant val1744gly  which has a phenotype very similar to, but slightly less penetrant than, a notch <dig> null  <cit> . it also includes notch1+/null heterozygotes that have mild notch <dig> signaling defects uncovered in competition assays  <cit>  or by close examination of specific cell types  <cit> . haploinsufficiency of notch <dig> is the basis of aortic valve disease in humans  <cit> . we predict that notch1+/lbd and notch1+/12f heterozygotes have slightly less notch <dig> signaling than notch1+/tm1con and should display evidence of more extensive notch <dig> signaling defects in particular cell types. the range of notch <dig> mutant alleles available in the mouse should be helpful in identifying new in vivo functions for notch <dig>
