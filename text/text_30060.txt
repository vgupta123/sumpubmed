BACKGROUND
rhodococcus equi is a gram-positive bacterium and a facultative intracellular pathogen of alveolar macrophages. rhodococcus equi can cause bronchopneumonia in foals up to five months of age  <cit> . this bacterium has further been identified as an opportunistic pathogen in individuals compromised by immunosuppressive drug therapy, lymphoma, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome   <cit> .

isolates from pneumonic foals possess a large plasmid that varies in size from  <dig> to 90 kb  <cit> . this plasmid is present in most clinical r. equi isolates recovered from infected foals but it is absent from most environmental strains  <cit> . importantly, plasmid-cured isogenic mutants of virulent strains lose their ability to survive in macrophages and are unable to cause pneumonia in foals  <cit> . a highly immunogenic 15–17 kda protein of unknown function, designated as virulence-associated protein a , is encoded within a pathogenicity island of this virulence plasmid  <cit> . vapa is essential for intracellular growth in macrophages and for full virulence in an infected mouse model  <cit> .

the expression of vapa is controlled by temperature and ph, where maximum expression occurs at 34–41°c with a ph of  <dig>   <cit> . these characteristics suggest that vapa expression is intracellularly upregulated in the mammalian host. indeed, transcription of vapa is increased in ex vivo murine and equine macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, expression of vapa can be detected in macrophages recovered from pulmonary lesions of infected foals  <cit> .

the virr gene encodes a lysr-type transcriptional regulator that affects vapa gene expression  <cit> . dna binding studies have shown that virr binds to a dna fragment that contains the vapa promoter . virr alone can induce vapa expression, but vapa expression is enhanced when four genes downstream of virr are also present. one of these genes is virs; it encodes a protein that shares homology with the ompr/phob family of response regulators  <cit> . it has not yet been demonstrated whether virs is involved in the regulation of the pvapa-promoter activity.

in the present study, we constructed a virs deletion mutant and analyzed pvapa promoter activity using a r. equi strain that harbored a pvapa-lacz fusion virulence plasmid. our results suggest that virs contributes to the regulation of vapa transcription, and is thus a critical component of r. equi virulence.

RESULTS
development of a reporter system to analyze vapa gene expression
previous studies have reported that vapa gene expression is regulated by temperature and ph  <cit> . to confirm these regulatory effects, we performed western blot analysis on cellular extracts of the r. equi atcc <dig> strain grown under four different conditions: 30°c at ph  <dig> , 30°c at ph  <dig> , 37°c at ph  <dig> , and 37°c at ph  <dig>  . maximal expression of vapa occurred at 37°c and ph  <dig> . at 37°c and ph  <dig> , vapa expression was lower but still detectable. when bacteria were grown at 30°c; however, vapa expression was undetectable. to measure the promoter activity of the vapa gene using a β-galactosidase assay, we constructed a mutant strain wherein the virulence plasmid contained a pvapa-lacz fusion. the highest β-galactosidase activity was detected when this strain was grown at 37°c and ph  <dig>  . at 37°c and ph  <dig> , β-galactosidase activity was lower. thus, these results agreed with the results of the western blot analysis. at 30°c, β-galactosidase activity was approximately 12-fold lower than that at 37°c and ph  <dig> . importantly, these results indicated that this reporter strain could be used to analyze vapa gene expression.figure  <dig>

virs is required for vapa expression
a previous study reported that vapa expression was higher when four genes including virs were present in addition to virr, when compared with virr alone   <cit> . to examine whether this increase could be attributed to virs, the virs gene was deleted from the virulence plasmid in the pvapa-lacz fusion strain. in the Δvirs mutant, vapa promoter activity was reduced to a non-detectable level . complementation of the Δvirs mutant with virs expressed via from the paphii promoter on the bacterial chromosome increased pvapa-lacz expression by more than two-fold when this strain was grown under inducing conditions. moreover, when the complemented mutant was grown at 30°c , the transcription level of pvapa-lacz was the same as that of the strain grown under inducing conditions. these results suggest that virs is required for vapa expression and that vapa transcription can be induced if virs is expressed, even when grown under non-inducing conditions.figure  <dig>

phosphorylation of asp <dig> is not required for the function of virs
activation of ompr/phob family response regulators requires phosphorylation of a conserved aspartate residue  <cit> . interestingly, virs contains an aspartate residue  that represents a putative phosphorylation site . to determine whether asp <dig> in virs is necessary for virs function, asp <dig> was replaced with alanine via site-directed mutagenesis. transcription of pvapa-lacz in the virs  mutant was comparable to that of the strain expressing wild-type virs when they were both grown under inducing conditions . these results suggest that the putative phosphorylation site asp <dig> is not necessary for virs function.figure  <dig>

virs can increase pvapa promoter activity in the absence of a functional virr
previous reports suggest that virr is required for the expression of both vapa and virs  <cit> , and our results support the hypothesis that virs can increase vapa expression in the presence of virr. to examine whether virs function is virr dependent, we constructed a virr deletion mutant. as the promoter of the icga operon containing virs is located within the virr orf , we did not delete the entire virr gene. instead, only the locus that corresponded to the helix-turn-helix region  was deleted and the promoter of the icga operon was kept intact. the virrΔhth mutation reduced the transcription level of pvapa-lacz to undetectable levels under non-inducing conditions . when virs was expressed from the chromosomal paphii promoter in the virrΔhth mutant, the pvapa promoter was activated to comparable levels detected in the presence of virr. these results suggest that virs can activate transcription of the pvapa promoter in the absence of virr.

transcription of the icga operon is regulated by temperature and ph
a previous study reported that transcription of the icga operon  was virr dependent and was induced at 37°c and ph  <dig>   <cit> . although inducing  and non-inducing  conditions were compared, it was still not clear whether the transcription of the icga operon was regulated by temperature, ph, or both. thus, we semi-quantitatively determined the transcriptional level of the icga operon by real-time rt-pcr. as shown previously, transcription of all the genes in this operon was induced when the wild-type strain was grown at 37°c and ph  <dig>  . however, their transcriptional levels were lower when cells were grown at 37°c and ph  <dig> . transcription was even lower when cells were grown at 30°c. in agreement with the previous study, we did not observe an increase in the transcription of the icga operon in the virrΔhth mutant . these results demonstrate that transcription of the icga operon is virr dependent and that it is regulated by both temperature and ph.figure  <dig>

discussion
pneumonia-causing virulence by the bacterial pulmonary pathogen r. equi has not been fully elucidated. however, a previous study has demonstrated that virr is involved in the regulation of the vapa gene located on the r. equi virulence plasmid  <cit> . to examine the contribution of virs  to r. equi virulence and the expression of vapa, we constructed an r. equi virs deletion strain paired with a pvapa-lacz reporter virulence plasmid. in the current study, we demonstrate that virs is another transcriptional regulator encoded on the virulence plasmid that is required for vapa transcription.

with this work, we show that deletion of virs reduced the transcriptional activation of the vapa promoter to non-inducible levels. further, previous studies have demonstrated that virr is constitutively expressed and that virs has no effect on the transcription of virr  <cit> . together, these data suggested that virr expression would be unaltered in a Δvirs mutant, and that virr alone is not sufficient to activate the transcription of vapa in the absence of virs. in addition, deletion of virr completely abolished vapa promoter activity. however, it has previously been demonstrated that virr is required for virs expression  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that virs has an indirect effect on vapa gene transcription. indeed, virs expression via the paphii promoter restored expression of the pvapa-lacz fusion plasmid in the virrΔhth mutant, thereby supporting this hypothesis. furthermore, when virs was expressed via the paphii promoter, there was no difference in transcription from the vapa promoter in the presence or absence of virr. these results indicate that virs can activate vapa transcription via the vapa promoter in the absence of functional virr.

interestingly, chromosomal integration of the paphii-virs fusion did not restore pvapa-lacz expression to wild-type levels in the Δvirs and virrΔhth deletion mutants. furthermore, activation of the pvapa promoter was observed under non-inducing conditions. it is possible that expression of the paphii-virs fusion, which was present as a monocopy on the chromosome, may have resulted in lower virs expression levels when compared with virs expression from the virulence plasmid, as each cell harbors two or more plasmid copies  <cit> . in addition, this may have caused disordered regulation when virs was expressed from the paphii promoter but not from the original promoter found on the virulence plasmid.

virs is an orphan response regulator, and its cognate sensor is not found on the virulence plasmid  <cit> . virs can activate the pvapa promoter under non-inducing conditions; thus, ph and temperature are unlikely to be the stimuli that are responsible for virs activation. we further observed that the asp57ala mutation did not affect activity of the pvapa promoter when compared with that of wild-type virs under inducing conditions. these data suggest that this putative phosphorylation site is not necessary for function of this domain. although most residues that are critical for canonical functions in response regulators are well conserved in virs, asp <dig>  which chelates the mg2+ necessary for aspartic acid phosphorylation, is substituted with arginine  <cit> . substitution of this conserved residue in the e. coli chey protein means that it cannot chelate mg2+ effectively and phosphorylation of asp <dig> is blocked  <cit> . however, other ompr/phob subfamily members such as myxococcus xanthus frzs and helicobacter pylori hp <dig> retain their functional activity in the absence of phosphorylation  <cit> . therefore, virs may be another atypical response regulator that does not require a sensor protein for activation.

in the present study, we demonstrated that the picga promoter is regulated by both temperature and ph, and this corresponds to regulation of the pvapa promoter. further, expression of virs from the paphii promoter could induce the vapa transcription under non-inducing conditions. these results suggest that regulation of vapa by temperature and ph may be achieved by controlling virs expression levels, and a proposed model for this regulation is presented in figure  <dig>  as such, mechanisms that regulate expression of the icga operon are likely crucial in controlling vapa gene expression via environmental stimuli in the bacterial pathogen r. equi.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
virs is required for the expression of vapa, and virs expression is regulated by both temperature and ph. we hypothesize that regulation of the pvapa promoter is influenced by virs expression levels. future studies are required to examine the mechanisms that regulate transcription of the virs-containing icga operon, and how this operon contributes to r. equi virulence.
