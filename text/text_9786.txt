BACKGROUND
somatosensory information from the hand is first processed cortically in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex  but also reaches classically defined motor areas in the frontal cortex  <cit> . the n <dig> component of the median nerve somatosensory evoked potential  is a promising physiological index of somatosensory inflow to frontal motor cortical structures. it has been hypothesized to be generated in the supplementary motor area   <cit>  and its amplitude to reflect incoming proprioceptive sensory information  <cit> .

the n <dig> has been investigated under various sensory-motor paradigms and generally been shown to behave similarly to parietal sep components  <cit>  though does display unique modulation independent of parietal sep components under specific motor-related conditions such as mental imagery and ideation  <cit>  as well as a distinct attenuation in parkinson's disease . the depressed n <dig> in pd patients can be transiently facilitated with dopamine agonist administration  <cit> , pallidotomy  <cit>  or globus pallidus interal segment /sub-thalamic nucleus  stimulation  <cit>  and as such, n <dig> amplitude has been hypothesized to reflect the proper functioning of specific motor pathways linking basal ganglia to frontal cortex  <cit> .

the n <dig> has previously been demonstrated to be facilitated independently of parietal components during upper-limb movements contralateral to the stimulating site  <cit> . for example, legon et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that n <dig> facilitation only occurs during but not before or after voluntary movement, suggesting an influence of motor cortical activity as a result of contralateral hand movement. however, it is unclear if n <dig> facilitation is contingent upon the relationship between the side of sensory input and motor output as a reversal of sensory input and motor output across the upper limbs was not investigated. it may be that hemispheric dominance affects sensorimotor integration across the upper-limbs as the effect of sensory input upon motor cortical activity is different across hemispheres  <cit> . furthermore, use of the non-dominant hand results in unique recruitment of basal-ganglia nuclei  <cit> , sma  <cit> , ipsilateral motor cortex  <cit>  and subsequent differences in inter-hemispheric inhibition between motor cortices both before and during movement  <cit> .

there are a few reports employing seps that have shown an effect of contralateral upper-limb movement upon sep amplitudes  <cit> . hoshiyama & kakigi  <cit>  had both right and left-hand dominant participants perform a tracing task with either their dominant or non-dominant hand while recording seps from the hand contralateral to movement. interestingly, non-dominant hand use resulted in an attenuation of n <dig> amplitude; a result at odds with the work of both rossini et al.  <cit>  and legon et al.  <cit> . this discrepancy may be a result of increased demands associated with the tracing task whereas a simple volitional movement was performed in the former studies. despite this, modulation of the n <dig> in the hoshiyama & kakigi  <cit>  study only occurred for tracing performed with the non-dominant hand in both right and left hand dominant participants suggesting a specific relationship for n <dig> modulation during non-dominant upper-limb motor output regardless of hand dominance.

these results would suggest a link between the n <dig> and non-dominant hand use but it is nonetheless unclear if handedness has an effect upon the integration of sensory input and motor output across the upper-limbs and if this translates to modulation of either parietal or frontal sep components during a simple volitional motor task that is not highly skilled or requires vision. hoshiyama & kakigi  <cit>  reported no differences between right and left hand dominant individuals but anatomical  <cit>  and cortical excitability differences between left and right hand dominant individuals have been reported  <cit>  and may contribute to n <dig> amplitude modulation.

it is the purpose of the current study to determine if n <dig> facilitation observed by legon et al.  <cit>  is exclusive to movement of the non-dominant upper-limb and further if this relationship persists in left hand dominant individuals. participants were instructed to voluntarily squeeze a pressure-sensitive bulb roughly every  <dig> seconds with either their dominant or non-dominant hand while median nerve stimulations were continuously delivered to the contralateral wrist. these stimulations were later binned according to timings of the bereitschaftspotential to assess amplitude differences of the n <dig> before, during and after movement of the contralateral hand. it is hypothesized that n <dig> facilitation is specific to movement of the non-dominant hand in both right and left hand dominant individuals due to differences in cortical activation during non-dominant hand movement or potentially through differences in centrifugal gating of peripheral sensory inputs between the limbs.

RESULTS
all eight left-handed and right-handed participants showed clear frontal and parietal seps. no latency differences were observed for any of the seps measured and m-wave amplitudes  wave resulting from the direct stimulation of the motoneuronal axons serving the thenar musculature) displayed no differences across conditions.

discussion
it was the purpose of this study to determine the effect of hand movement and hand dominance upon the amplitude of the n <dig> sep during a simple volitional movement. previous literature  <cit>  has demonstrated a frontal n <dig> amplitude increase during voluntary non-dominant hand movement in right hand dominant participants. this study demonstrates a facilitation of frontal n <dig> sep amplitude during non-dominant hand movement but not during dominant hand movement and further that this relationship is true for left hand dominant individuals as well. it is currently unclear why n <dig> amplitude is facilitated only during non-dominant hand movement but may be the result of specific activation of basal ganglia, sma and/or primary motor cortex for non-dominant as compared to dominant hand use  <cit> . in addition to the understood motor roles of these areas, all receive sensory input  <cit>  and thus are candidate areas for the integration of sensory input for motor control. as such, peripheral sensory input from the dominant limb may be differentially modulated as compared to non-dominant inputs during contralateral hand use by altered active centrifugal gating mechanisms.

the n <dig> has been hypothesized to be the result of peripheral proprioceptive afference  <cit>  and its amplitude may reflect the proper functioning of centripetal and/or centrifugal sensory gating mechanisms  <cit> . the persistent finding of a depressed or absent n <dig> in the pd population  <cit>  suggests a link between it and the basal ganglia dopaminergic system, such that the amplitude of the n <dig> reflects the healthy functioning of the basal-ganglia, cortico-cortical motor loops  <cit> . the dopaminergic hypothesis for n <dig> amplitude is further corroborated by the findings that dopaminergic administration  <cit> , pallidotomy  <cit>  and gpi or stn stimulation  <cit>  facilitate the n <dig> that is paralleled by clinical improvement. interestingly, n <dig> amplitude increase in the pd population under these interventions is commonly correlated with a reduction in rigidity  <cit> . as such, it may very well be that restoration of the basal-ganglia dopaminergic system is not the direct cause of n <dig> facilitation but rather results in less gating of peripheral sensory inputs to cortical motor structures  through a reduction in rigidity  <cit>  which acts to inhibit sensory inflow similar to the effects of voluntary or passive movement. this hypothesis is corroborated by the results of pierantozzi et al.  <cit>  who demonstrated atracurium  administration to increase the n <dig> not only in pd patients but also in neuroleptic malignant syndrome patients and healthy controls; groups with intact dopaminergic systems.

alternately, the n <dig> amplitude difference may be the result of altered sensory gating mechanisms due to known activity differences in the basal ganglia, sma and m <dig> during non-dominant hand use. for example, francois-brosseau et al.  <cit>  reported reduced blood oxygenation-level dependant  response in the left putamen, thalamus and right caudate for self-initiated finger movement of the non-dominant left hand as compared to the same movement performed by the dominant right hand. babiloni et al  <cit>  reported that non-dominant hand movement results in right sma activation whereas dominant hand movement results in both right and left sma activity. the sma receives dense afferents from the gpi  <cit>  and in turn, projects to primary motor cortex   <cit> . the connections of the basal ganglia with sma are excitatory and those of the sma to m <dig> are largely inhibitory in nature. micro-stimulation of the sma results in inhibitory post-synaptic potentials on pyramidal neurons in m <dig>  <cit>  and a conditioning stimulus delivered to the sma reduces the excitability of m <dig> to a test pulse  <cit> . pd patients often show decreased activation of the sma and increased activation of m <dig>  <cit>  in addition to a lack of cortico-cortical inhibition in m <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, an increase in ipsilateral m <dig> is a persistent finding during non-dominant hand use  <cit>  a phenomenon that does not often occur for dominant hand use  <cit> . the purpose of ipsilateral m <dig> activity is currently unclear though it has been hypothesized to represent inhibition to presumably prevent mirroring of the dominant hand. using functional mri, kobayashi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated increased intra-cortical inhibition of ipsilateral m <dig> in those that displayed ipsilateral m <dig> activity and none in those that did not. an alternate or complimentary theory may be that ipsilateral m <dig> activity during non-dominant hand use serves to reduce the amount of sensory gating exerted upon the dominant limb. no modulation of n <dig> amplitude was witnessed either before or after non-dominant hand movement or for any timing epoch explored for the dominant hand, further suggesting a role for ipsilateral m <dig> activity in the modulation of n <dig> amplitude. it cannot be said with absolute conviction if this is a purposeful mechanism but may be a way of the central nervous system to increase the fidelity of sensory inputs from the dominant limb to aid motor planning and execution of the less apt non-dominant limb. it is well understood that there are manual asymmetries in motor performance between the dominant and non-dominant limb such that behaviour of the non-dominant limb is usually slower, more variable and less accurate  <cit> .

parkinson's patients show altered response to somatosensory inputs  <cit>  and have difficulty performing efficient and precise movements when relying upon kinaesthetic sensory feedback but their performance improves for externally-cued or visually-guided motor tasks  <cit> , a phenomenon hypothesized to be the result of incorporating alternate sources of sensory input. interestingly, the above mentioned differences in basal-ganglia activation for non-dominant hand use during volitional tasks disappeared for an externally triggered task  <cit> . if indeed n <dig> amplitude is reflective of the proper functioning of a basal-ganglia - sma - m <dig> loop in response to kinaesthetic sensory input, hypotheses would suggest either no increase or a decrease in n <dig> amplitude during non-dominant hand movement under a condition reliant upon vision which is what hoshiyama & kakigi  <cit>  found. they reported a reduction in n <dig> amplitude for non-dominant as compared to dominant hand movement during a visually guided tracing task. the reduced n <dig> in this case may reflect increased sensory gating of proprioceptive inputs from the dominant limb that would essentially be less informative or reliable than the visual information. indeed, bernier et al.  <cit>  have shown that proprioceptive information is suppressed during a mirror reversal task - a task that is heavily reliant upon visual information. this suppression was reflected in an attenuation of the parietal p <dig> leaving the n <dig> unaffected. the lack of n <dig> change may have been a result of an already depressed n <dig> as a result of movement-related gating  or perhaps because the dominant limb was used to perform the movement in this study. the differences in n <dig> amplitude during tasks that rely upon vision or cueing versus those that are volitional and largely use proprioceptive feedback is supported by the results of urushihara et al.  <cit>  who demonstrated an increase in n <dig> amplitude as a result of pre-motor cortical inhibition from low frequency repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation. the pre-motor cortex, as opposed to the sma, is preferentially activated for externally triggered vs. internally generated movements  <cit> .

none of the parietal potentials measured displayed an interaction of movement hand and timing as the n <dig> did. if ipsilateral m <dig> activity during non-dominant hand use is a source of n <dig> modulation, it would be reasonable to hypothesize an effect upon potentials generated in s <dig> due to the dense ipsilateral connectivity  <cit>  and interaction  <cit>  between m <dig> and s <dig>  interpretation of the results of the reported parietal potentials is not clear. generally, inhibition of early parietal potentials as a result of movement is limited to the site of movement  <cit>  and does not occur across the upper limbs though modulation of the n <dig> and p <dig> has been reported during contralateral hand movement under specific attention requirements  <cit> . the lack of a specific effect of movement time and movement hand upon the n <dig> and p <dig> parietal potentials may be due to differences in the response of s <dig> and sma to somatosensory input. s <dig> is active to passive tactile stimulation but sma activity is only present for tactile stimulation that is required for a motor output  <cit> , thus the n <dig> and p <dig> may not be affected by specific motor activity. it should be noted however that the p <dig> was specifically inhibited during the movement epoch regardless of the hand performing the task, a finding that corroborates and extends the findings of legon et al.  <cit>  suggesting that parietal potentials generated outside of area 3b/ <dig> can be modulated by contralateral movement. the p <dig> has been reported to be generated in s <dig>  <cit>  and may be specifically generated in area  <dig> as the preceding p27-n <dig> complex has been postulated to be generated in area  <dig>  <cit> . area  <dig> has connectivity with both the sma  <cit> , ipsilateral m <dig>  <cit>  and secondary somatosensory cortex. the connection with secondary somatosensory cortex provides a route of action for modulation of the p <dig> independently of the n <dig> and p <dig>  secondary somatosensory cortex is active bilaterally in response to unilateral stimulation and more importantly displays movement related activity  <cit>  similar to the cells of sma.

finally, it should be noted that recent research  <cit>  has attributed n <dig> amplitude to a phase-locking of the beta/gamma frequency. under this hypothesis, evoked potentials may not be the result of localized processing or a fixed latency response to a specific stimulus but rather a reset of oscillatory activity, in the case of the n <dig> in the beta/gamma frequency. under the oscillatory model of event-related potentials, an increase in amplitude of a specific potential reflects an increase in the influence of an oscillation which is assumed to be related to specific task processing . cebolla et al.  <cit>  recently demonstrated movement-related gating of n <dig> amplitude to disrupt beta/gamma phase-locking providing additional evidence in support of the oscillatory model of event-related potentials. if indeed this model proves correct, the data from this study would suggest that non-dominant hand movement specifically affects the beta/gamma oscillation, which may be an indication of synchronization or co-activation of cortical and sub-cortical networks  that are specifically active during non-dominant hand movement.

CONCLUSIONS
non-dominant hand use results in different activation of the basal ganglia, sma and m <dig> and an increase in amplitude of the n <dig> compared to dominant hand use. the relationship between these different activation patterns and n <dig> amplitude is not clear. the specific attenuation of n <dig> amplitude in pd has lead to investigation of the basal ganglia and dopaminergic contribution to n <dig> amplitude. it is clear that classically defined motor pathologies have a sensory contribution and the dysfunction of sensory integration may be critical  <cit> . these sensory gating mechanisms may be different between the upper-limbs depending upon hand use and reflected in the amplitude of the n <dig>
