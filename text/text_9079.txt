BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular zoonotic parasite that chronically infects 30% of the world’s human population  <cit> . it has a complex life cycle, infecting a wide range of mammals and birds as intermediate hosts but with felids as the only definitive hosts. intermediate hosts can become infected through ingestion of oocysts shed into the environment via cat feces or by ingesting tissue cysts in meat or viscera  <cit> . during acute infection of naïve intermediate hosts, sporozoites from oocysts or bradyzoites from tissue cysts differentiate quickly into tachyzoites, which divide rapidly and disseminate throughout the host’s body. tachyzoites are, however, controlled efficiently by cell mediated immunity and the parasite reverts to the slowly replicating or quiescent bradyzoite form, which resides within tissue cysts that are particularly abundant in brain and heart muscle but are also present throughout skeletal muscle  <cit> . when cats ingest tissue cysts, bradyzoites can take a different developmental pathway. they are released from their cysts and invade enterocytes of the small intestine, transforming into schizonts  <cit> . the parasite population that develops in cat enterocytes undergoes a classical coccidian cycle involving several rounds of asexual division and amplification followed by differentiation into macro- and microgamonts, the dimorphic stages of sexual development. microgametes fertilize macrogametes, producing diploid zygotes that subsequently develop into unsporulated oocysts that are excreted in the feces of the cat. the sexual phase continues within the oocyst as meiosis ensues, followed by mitosis to produce infectious sporozoites, encased within sporocysts inside the oocysts.

the readily culturable, rapidly dividing tachyzoite is the best studied form of t. gondii by far – there is abundant information about cell cycle, metabolism and host parasite interactions for this stage  <cit> . in contrast, the merozoite, which is the other rapidly dividing asexual form of t. gondii that ultimately generates hundreds of millions of gametes, is the least well studied developmental stage. this is largely because merozoites are not cultivatable in vitro and difficult to access in vivo. thus, investigation of the molecular mechanisms governing initiation of parasite amplification preceding the development of sexual stages in cats has been severely hampered. the need for a more detailed understanding of the development in the definitive host is underscored by the fact that infected cats shed hundreds of millions of oocysts that can remain infectious for over a year to a wide range of highly susceptible intermediate hosts, including humans  <cit> . here, we developed improved protocols for cat infection, parasite isolation, and next generation sequencing to close this knowledge gap by building a transcription profile for the merozoite stage of enteroepithelial development. using genome-wide comparative transcriptomics, we show that merozoites express distinct gene families in a stage-specific fashion, and fail to express the majority of annotated rop, gra and mic proteins which are upregulated during tachyzoite replication. among the most highly differentially regulated parasite proteins were several large gene families, including those coding for srs proteins found on the parasite cell surface. other key genes expressed by tachyzoites whose products are known to facilitate motility, host seeking, attachment, invasion, and remodeling of the parasitophorous vacuole  within the parasitized host cell were not expressed in merozoites. this strongly suggests that merozoites are biologically distinct and utilize a different suite of genes that are necessary for asexual expansion within feline enterocytes prior to gamont development.

RESULTS
purification of merozoites from feline enterocytes for rna-seq analysis
t. gondii parasite preparations were generated from enterocytes from an infected cat at onset of patency . the enterocyte cell layer containing replicating parasites as shown by ifa  from two regions of the rinsed and opened small intestine were selectively harvested by mechanical stripping . repeated centrifugation and re-suspension of this material with ice-cold  <dig> % tween <dig> in pbs yielded microscopically pure fractions of extracellular merozoites . the released merozoites showed differential staining with diff-quick ; no gametocyte stages were observed in this fraction by microscopy. however, even though there is no evidence for this in the rna-seq data  we cannot completely exclude minor contributions from sexual stages  to the rna pool selected for analysis. nevertheless, based on the overwhelming majority of merozoites in the sample at this early time point of infection we will henceforth refer to this fraction as “merozoites”. although further percoll gradient purification yielded merozoites that were completely free of host material, we used the detergent-washed preparations containing minor contamination with host rna  for sequencing to avoid any changes to the parasite transcriptome due to additional manipulations.figure  <dig>

merozoites possess highly significant stage-specific mrna expression differences from tachyzoites
read mapping revealed a significant number of unique reads for  <dig> genes after removal of reads mapping to trna and ribosomal rna sequences, and normalization. calculation of rpkm values  to normalize for dataset size and gene length revealed  <dig> genes with threshold rpkms ≥ <dig> in at least one of the two life-cycle stages. comparative analysis  was performed using deseq  <cit>  to detect differential gene expression. we used a high threshold of ≥ 8-fold difference in mrna levels  to identify stage-specifically regulated genes  <cit> . the rigorous analytical approach revealed significant stage-specific expression differences for approximately 10% of genes annotated in toxodb . applying the ≥ 8-fold difference threshold we identified  <dig> genes with tachyzoite-specific, versus  <dig> genes with merozoite-specific expression. this strategy therefore revealed only the most strongly stage-specifically regulated genes; maximal differences of rna expression values of 54-fold  and 404-fold  were measured.figure  <dig>

rnas with ≥ 8-fold difference in abundance at each life cycle stage were parsed, and distributions into eleven gene product or functional categories are shown as pie charts . the global comparison identified hypothetical genes as the most abundant set of stage-specific genes  expressed between the two developmental stages examined. the rna-seq data will also serve to annotate, and thereby significantly reduce, the number of hypothetical genes found in both samples. genes related to metabolism or the cytoskeleton were not differentially regulated, with only a few exceptions. in contrast, the majority of genes implicated in host parasite interactions, such as secreted and surface proteins, were regulated in a stage-specific fashion . for example, significantly more surface  proteins were expressed in merozoites than in tachyzoites , and their expression was restricted exclusively to the merozoite developmental stage. in striking contrast, the majority of microneme-, rhoptry-, and dense granule-specific secreted proteins were not expressed in merozoites, suggesting the existence of an unannotated suite of mic, rop and gra proteins that promote merozoite asexual replication.figure  <dig>

merozoite specific gene families
several large, unannotated gene families containing many predicted secreted and/or membrane-associated proteins, referred to as the t. gondii family a-e proteins were identified to be largely merozoite stage-regulated . family a is predominantly merozoite-specific, with  <dig> of  <dig> members expressed above the ≥ 8-fold abundance threshold. only one family a gene was expressed exclusively in tachyzoites . members of the remaining four families  were likewise strongly expressed in merozoites , but just below the threshold . the “miscellaneous” category  also contains members of additional structural protein families many of whose members are strongly stage-regulated. one example is the lysine-arginine rich unidentified function  family of proteins  <cit>  . twelve of the  <dig> kruf family members are strongly expressed in tachyzoites but not expressed  in merozoites.

genome annotation
rna-seq data provides valuable information about the accuracy of existing gene models in toxodb  <cit> . in this case the newly generated datasets complement existing rna-seq data, currently from tachyzoite, bradyzoite, and oocyst stages. to estimate how many gene models have no associated rna-seq data we used toxodb search strategies. while a detailed revision of toxodb gene models based on rna-seq data will have to await additional data from cat-derived gametocytes, we used simple toxodb in-silico search strategies with stringent criteria to identify merozoite-specific gene models that are currently without any evidence for expression. several examples could be discovered by collating all predicted gene models for which no or insufficient  evidence for rna  or protein expression  exist at any stage of development and comparing them with the datasets developed in this study. we eliminated any entries with rpkm values > <dig> in tachyzoites and < <dig> in merozoites resulting in  <dig> genes for which significant expression is only documented in merozoites. the group comprises  <dig> family a genes , three hypothetical genes and srs15b. although such search strategies are difficult to threshold and require manual follow-up and verification, they represent examples of data mining efforts which are well within reach for experienced toxodb users. in addition, fortuitous discovery of large numbers of merozoite-specific rna-seq reads mapping to regions without predicted gene models, e.g. in a 4 kb region between tgme49_ <dig> and tgme49_ <dig> on chromosome ii, indicates that systematic mapping of merozoite data will lead to discovery and annotation of many novel protein coding genes.

metabolic capacity is similar in merozoites and tachyzoites
merozoite populations expand rapidly by asexual division whilst remaining strictly confined to the enterocyte monolayer  and presumably are confronted with less variability in terms of bioavailability of metabolites and building blocks than tachyzoites which infect different cell types. in addition, the parasite is ideally positioned to intercept the stream of nutrients flowing from the apical brush border to the basolateral face of the host enterocyte. in the absence of data on enzyme activity levels, mrna expression can be used effectively to model metabolic flux distributions and stage-specific changes  <cit> . global comparative analysis of metabolic gene expression was done on the subset of genes used for constructing the ics <dig> metabolic model for toxoplasma  <cit> . although we identified  <dig> “tachyzoite-specific” and  <dig> “merozoite-specific” genes based on >8-fold difference in mrna expression within this subset , there is little evidence in our data that any of these were clustered either on chromosomes or in any particular metabolic pathway. nevertheless, several genes of the energy metabolism are strongly regulated, with the glycolytic enzyme enolase  <dig>  showing the highest difference in expression, albeit with relatively low rpkm values, and is effectively silenced in merozoites . eno <dig> is a bradyzoite marker and thus not well expressed in tachyzoites to begin with. indeed, eno <dig> appears to be dispensable in tachyzoites: cells with a targeted deletion of the gene grow well in vitro and in vivo, but cyst numbers in chronically infected mice are significantly decreased  <cit> . conversely, the eno <dig>  gene is strongly downregulated in bradyzoites. in merozoites eno <dig> mrna is detected at ~2-fold higher levels  than in tachyzoites, which points to an adaptive response geared towards a higher glycolytic throughput compared to tachyzoites. although a more detailed analysis of energy metabolism would require rna-seq data for these enzymes in all coccidial stages and also bradyzoites integrated into a flux model such as ics <dig>  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that these adaptations in merozoites help sustain rapid growth in conditions of low oxygen tension in the gut. in addition to their function in glycolysis, nuclear targeted eno isoenzymes were shown bind to chromosomal dna and modulate gene expression  <cit> . the significance of low levels of eno <dig> expression in the tachyzoite dataset and the tight silencing of the gene in merozoites in the context of their regulatory functions remain to be investigated. the stage-specific regulation of eno expression is also consistent with  <dig>  fold higher levels of phosphoglycerate kinase pgki  rna-seq reads in merozoites. in line with this, differential expression of the two glycolytic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes ldh <dig> and ldh <dig>  <cit>  in merozoites is very similar to tachyzoites but even more pronounced: virtual silencing of ldh <dig>  but strong expression of ldh <dig> . there are also several examples for tachyzoite-specific expression of metabolic factors: both nadph-generating glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase , an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase , a key enzyme in the biotin synthesis pathway, are not expressed in merozoites . biotin provides the prosthetic group for carboxyl transferases and has essential functions in many anabolic and catabolic reactions. because biotin is contained in food but also supplied by gut microorganisms, a complete shutdown of its synthesis in merozoites suggests that developmental stages in enterocytes rely entirely on scavenging the easily accessible protein.

the most strongly regulated metabolic gene in merozoites relative to tachyzoites is glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  , with essentially no expression in the latter  but a 20-fold higher expression in merozoites  . rna-seq reads for the homoserine o-acetyltransferase gene coding for an enzyme of the methionine biosynthesis pathway are similarly increased in merozoites. interestingly, expression of two genes involved in purine metabolism, adenylosuccinate synthetase, , and hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase  is > 8-fold higher in merozoites. the latter, a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway  <cit> , is expressed at a very high level in merozoites with an rpkm value of  <dig> compared to  <dig> in tachyzoites. another purine metabolism gene, purine nucleoside phosphorylase , is expressed 6-fold higher in merozoites , suggesting a possible expansion of purine salvage throughput at least during the asexual phase of parasite population growth during enteroepithelial development.

altogether, we conclude that in contrast to the marked differences in gene expression of secreted proteins in tachyzoites and merozoites, the expression of genes involved in metabolic processes is largely unaffected. hence, metabolism is predicted to be broadly similar between tachyzoites and merozoites, although there may be some fine-tuning in the latter for optimal growth in enterocytes. however, no fundamental differences were detectable that would indicate a radically different environment or nutrient availability for growth in enterocytes. a more detailed examination and testing of specific hypotheses using for example the recently developed flux balance analysis models to identify stage-specific metabolic bottlenecks  <cit>  will be required to confirm or refute this current interpretation as well as identify potential drug targets.

srs proteins are widely expressed in merozoites
the t. gondii genome encodes several distinct, coccidian-specific surface gene families, including the srs and sag-unrelated surface antigens   <cit> . arguably the most strikingly regulated set of genes in the merozoite dataset were those coding for the  <dig> members of the srs superfamily of proteins annotated in toxodb ; expression of more than  <dig> members of this family was present in merozoites, whereas a separate set of  <dig> srs genes were expressed exclusively in tachyzoites . nearly half of the merozoite expressed genes coding for srs proteins were present in  <dig> clusters, srs <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  srs proteins are involved in attachment to host cells, but also provoke immune reactions and regulate parasite virulence, which is thought to promote the formation of tissue cysts in intermediate hosts in order to establish persistent, latent infections that facilitate transmission of infection to the definitive host. previous work has showed that tachyzoites differentially express a number of srs genes  <cit> , and these expression differences have been postulated to account for the ability of this stage to invade a broader range of host cells than other coccidians  <cit> . however, merozoites, which only infect a single cell type  co-dominantly expressed a large repertoire of  <dig> srs proteins in a developmental life-cycle stage-dependent manner . alternatively, recent work has established that the srs fold is present in the  <dig> member pfs-230-related 6-cys family of plasmodium adhesins  <cit>  that facilitate gamete-gamete recognition and promote gamete recognition and fertilization. this may suggest that the merozoite-restricted srs genes are less relevant for attachment and invasion within enterocytes, but rather promote gamete development and fertilization. given the demonstrated ability of srs proteins to promote immune responses, it is also conceivable that they play a role in stimulating intestinal inflammation and diarrhea, to facilitate the production and dispersal of oocysts.

the striking stage-specificity of expression of srs genes in merozoites versus tachyzoites  raises questions about how their expression is regulated. one clue to this can be obtained from analysis of chromosomal distribution of the various srs genes  <cit> . however, we find little evidence of concerted clustering of merozoite- or tachyzoite-specific srs genes on distinct chromosomes , which is not a complete surprise since t. gondii srs genes are dispersed across all chromosomes and not exclusively in a subtelomeric regional distribution pattern for surface antigen genes that is characteristic for other protozoa  <cit> . thus, rather than relying on sequential expression of a single gene or promoting rapid ectopic recombination rates to generate surface antigenic variation, t. gondii expresses relatively large sets of non-overlapping, co-dominant srs transcripts  <cit> .figure  <dig>

merozoites express a distinct set of microneme proteins
micronemes are small organelles clustered at the anterior end of apicomplexan parasites and generally secrete adhesive proteins that are important for motility and invasion. microneme  proteins contain one or several adhesive domains such as thrombospondin, von willebrand factor a, epidermal growth factor  or pan-domains . comparative analysis of rna-seq data shows that the majority of the  <dig> toxoplasma mics and mic <dig> associated protein  accumulate a high number of mapped tachyzoite reads . conversely, the range of mic genes that are specifically expressed in merozoites is considerably reduced and restricted to the highly expressed genes coding for pan-domain containing proteins mic17a-c , mic <dig>  a gene annotated as a putative mic, and a microneme-like protein. interestingly, both mic <dig> and mic2ap  <cit> , as well as mic6-1- <dig>  <cit> , which are strongly expressed in tachyzoites and secreted as functional complexes, are virtually silenced in merozoites . similarly, the rna-seq reads for the mic <dig> escorter mic <dig>  <cit>  are >100-fold lower in merozoites, whilst mic <dig> mrnas are only 6-fold less abundant. since trafficking to the organelles, as well as deployment on the surface, seems to occur in complexes as a rule  <cit> , we analyzed the predicted topologies of the six merozoite-specific mic proteins. none had the predicted transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail typical for canonical escorters such as mic <dig>  <cit> . in tachyzoites these adhesin complexes are essential components of the molecular motor and play a key role in providing the machinery for gliding motility  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
differential expression of three mic escorter/adhesin complexes. expression values are indicated as , asterisks: genes coding for mic escorter proteins.



the number of microneme organelles of different apicomplexa has been correlated with the requirement for gliding motility  <cit> , ranging from many in eimeria sporozoites and merozoites  <cit>  to none in theileria zoites  <cit> . toxoplasma tachyzoites, which display vigorous gliding motility and are able to cross cell barriers, have many microneme organelles and express a wide range of mic proteins. although t. gondii merozoites have a high number of microneme organelles  <cit> , the complement of expressed mic and other genes  coding for proteins secreted from micronemes appears to be significantly restricted, suggesting that the size of the expressed protein complement is not necessarily correlated to the number of organelles present in the cell. on the other hand, the finding that prominent tachyzoite mic complexes are not expressed in merozoites , could be explained by fundamental differences in their mode of gliding motility and cell invasion in contrast to the extraintestinal developmental stages. because merozoite proliferation is restricted to enterocytes, the most obvious difference is that mature merozoites egress into the gut lumen and invade new host enterocytes from the exposed apical side. this requires some migration through intestinal contents and within the mucus layer rather than through intercellular spaces and on cell surfaces. because freshly isolated extracellular merozoites display vigorous gliding motility  it is unlikely that these stages are without surface adhesins linked to the glideosome complex  <cit> . rather, as yet unknown mic adhesins specific for enterocyte surface receptors and containing non-canonical adhesive domains will likely be discovered among hypothetical proteins that are expressed in a merozoite stage-specific manner.

merozoites only weakly express genes of the tachyzoite moving junction complex
there is a striking difference in expression of genes coding for rhoptry neck proteins  and ama <dig> in tachyzoites versus merozoites . in particular, mrna levels of genes coding for proteins that combine to form the moving junction as part of the tachyzoite invasion machinery   <cit>  are dramatically lower in merozoites. this supports the contention, raised above, that the mechanism of gliding motility and by extension cell invasion is distinct in merozoites. the dramatically lower expression of the canonical tachyzoite ama <dig>  in merozoites is not compensated by a significant increase in expression of the sporozoite-specific ama <dig> paralog and the associated spororon <dig>  <cit>  is not expressed. a third toxoplasma ama <dig> paralog  is weakly expressed in both stages, and its functional role in invasion, if any, remains to be demonstrated. interestingly, previous claims that ama <dig> is essential for tachyzoite invasion  <cit>  has been revised in light of recent data showing that ama <dig> knockout tachyzoites invade host cells normally in vitro  <cit> . on the one hand, gene expression data alone predicts that invasion via the massively expanded surface of the enterocyte brush border by merozoites is distinct from the well described process observed in extraintestinal stages. on the other, the exact requirements and concepts for formation of a tight junction  <cit>  which will be moved towards the posterior end of the invading parasite by motor proteins are currently being revisited  <cit> . while gene expression data indicates fundamental differences in cell invasion by merozoites, the question whether merozoites assemble an alternative moving junction machinery for invasion or invade enterocytes by an entirely different mechanism, e.g. based on membrane-zippering such as in theileria  <cit>  or neospora  <cit> , requires further investigation.figure  <dig>

merozoites express a distinct set of rhoptry proteins
we also investigated rna expression for a group of  <dig> genes coding for rhoptry proteins  compiled from annotated gene models on toxodb   <cit>  and expanded by manual annotation . in total  <dig> rop genes were significantly differentially expressed  between tachyzoites and merozoites ;  <dig> genes were considered not expressed in merozoites  whereas two were expressed at very low levels  in merozoites. four rop genes were, however, expressed specifically in merozoites. interestingly, in a survey of known functions of rop proteins, we find that the prominent murine virulence factors rop <dig> and rop18/ <dig> are not expressed in merozoites.

rop <dig> and  <dig>  which both possess a conserved catalytic triad and phosphoryltransfer activity, have been identified as secreted, strain-specific virulence factors in mice. rop <dig> phosphorylates the signal transducers and activators of transcription   <dig> and  <dig>  and regulates interleukin  <dig> levels  <cit> . the polymorphic rop <dig> kinase phosphorylates and thus inhibits loading of immunity-related gtpase   <dig> onto the pv membrane, thereby preventing parasite clearance in infected mice by activated macrophages  <cit> . rop <dig>  a pseudokinase with an altered catalytic triad, regulates the kinase activity of rop <dig>  <cit>  possibly by an allosteric mechanism. therefore, the absence of irgs in cats is the simplest explanation for the silencing of the rop <dig>  gene in merozoites rendering expression and secretion of these rops as part of a defense strategy redundant during enteroepithelial development.

merozoites express a distinct set of dense granule proteins
we detected significant differences in expression within the current set of  <dig> annotated genes encoding dense granule  proteins . there was a significant overall bias towards high expression in tachyzoites. twelve gra genes were not expressed in merozoites , whilst only  <dig> gra genes  are >8-fold higher expressed in cat stages . the high expression of gra <dig> in tachyzoites is intriguing, since this protein regulates parasite egress from host cells  <cit>  and the absence of gra <dig> expression in merozoites is therefore puzzling. this might imply that egress from cat enterocytes is less coordinated by the parasite and this may partially explain why parasite development is asynchronous in the cat intestine. gra genes expressed in tachyzoites fall into two main groups: moderately highly expressed gra genes  code for proteins that are exported across the pv membrane that function to alter host gene expression ; versus highly expressed gra genes  some of whose products participate in the formation of the tubulovesicular network  within the pv space. our rnaseq data shows that gra <dig> is not expressed in merozoites. this tachyzoite virulence factor has a well-defined role in the activation of several host cell pathways that trigger potent pro-inflammatory responses causally associated with tachyzoite to bradyzoite conversion  <cit> . in mice, parasite survival is dependent on combined expression of gra <dig> with the stat-activating form of rop <dig>  <cit> . both gra <dig> and rop <dig> genes are not expressed in merozoites, strongly suggesting that jak-stat3/ <dig> and nf-κb signaling pathways in enterocytes of the definitive host are not targeted by these secreted factors. gra <dig> and  <dig> are also not expressed in merozoites. gra <dig> was recently identified as a parasite soluble effector that traffics to the host cell nucleus, interacts with p <dig>  and is thought to synergize with gra <dig> to promote production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, il <dig>  <cit> . similarly, gra <dig> is exported to the host cell nucleus and affects transcription of host cell genes involved in metabolism and cell cycle processes  <cit> . whether these host cellular processes are not targeted by merozoite gene products during their asexual expansion in cat enterocytes, or if as yet unannotated merozoite-specific paralogs exist to perform this function, remain to be established.

the rpkm values for gra <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, coding for three proteins which are directly associated with the tvn in the pv  <cit> , are >8-fold lower in merozoites compared to tachyzoites . the silencing of these gras  in merozoites is consistent with electron microscopy data  <cit>  showing that type c-e schizonts in cat enterocytes do not elaborate the extensive tvn which is typical of vacuolar spaces of tachyzoites, bradyzoites and type a and b schizonts. this suggests that later stage schizonts dispense with the tvn because of their different mode of cell division  <cit> ; parasites in type c-e schizonts multiply by endopolygeny rather than by endodyogeny as early stage merozoites, tachyzoites and bradyzoites. magno et al.  <cit>  suggested that an important structural function of the tvn might be organization of daughter cells within the pv during multiplication. involution of the tvn and repression of genes coding for factors associated with these membranes in merozoites is consistent with endopolygeny and attachment of parasites to residual bodies  <cit> . conversely, the gra <dig> gene, whose 36 kda product is involved in nutrient acquisition by trapping host endosomal-lysosomal vesicles in the pv  <cit> , is expressed at ~4-fold lower levels in merozoites  but is still relatively abundant with an rpkm value of  <dig> . thus, although not always associated with the pv membrane, gra <dig> appears to be universally expressed throughout the life cycle  <cit> .

additional factors secreted by dense granules include kazal-type protease inhibitors pi <dig>  pi <dig>   <cit>  , which are secreted into the pv and appear to be differentially regulated, despite strong conservation on the structural and sequence level. whilst read numbers for the pi <dig> gene, the most abundantly expressed protease inhibitor in tachyzoites  <cit> , are >2-fold higher in merozoites, pi <dig> is not expressed in merozoites . three of five additional genes annotated as kazal-type family protease inhibitors  show significantly higher expression in merozoites. however, whether the four predicted secreted members of this group also traffic via dense granules is unknown.

trans and cis regulators of merozoite and tachyzoite biology
both trans and cis regulators are known to play crucial roles in the transcription of stage specific genes in t. gondii. the trans-acting apiap <dig> transcription factors were discovered in the apicomplexa almost 10 years ago  <cit>  and regulate various developmental processes in t. gondii, including bradyzoite conversion, with tgap2xi- <dig>  <cit> , and tgap2ix- <dig>  <cit>  promoting and restricting tissue cyst formation, respectively, as well as the tachyzoite cell cycle, with tgap2xi- <dig> potentially regulating hundreds of cell cycle-dependent genes  <cit> . using stringent criteria we identified three significantly merozoite- or tachyzoite-specifically expressed apiap2-coding genes in our study . one merozoite-specific gene tgap2viia-i, and two tachyzoite-specific genes, tgap2xii-i and tgap2viia-ii showed >8-fold difference in their expression levels, suggesting that these transcription factors may play a role in regulating a suite of stage-specific genes. relaxing the criterion to include genes differing ≥4-fold in mrna abundance identified  <dig> additional tachyzoite-, and  <dig> additional merozoite-specific genes . interestingly, several other tgap <dig> genes were expressed at very low levels, and in the case of tgap2xii- <dig>  can be considered silenced in both stages. overall, differential expression of tgap <dig> is not extensive between tachyzoite and merozoites, and this may reflect their similar life cycle fate as rapidly amplifying asexual stages. however, the evenly graded distribution of rpkm values  suggests that some differences may become more pronounced when merozoites differentiate to gametocytes. moreover, the two datasets compared here do not represent synchronized populations, which would average out any dynamics occurring during the merogony cell cycle specifically during development from stage a through stage e schizonts. by contrast,  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted tgap2-coding genes were found to be differentially expressed at different check-points of the tachyzoite cell cycle in a microarray analysis of synchronized parasites  <cit> . in addition, apiap2s have been shown to bind other transcriptional regulators such as histone lysine acetyltransferases  <cit> , histone deacetlyase  <cit>  and even other apiap2s  <cit> , producing interactions that may confound correlations between transcription factor activities and their cognate gene transcript levels.

next, we used the regulatory sequence analysis tools on-line computational resource  to perform a global analysis of upstream flanking sequences of stage-specifically expressed genes. the analysis returned several enriched six-base dna motifs within the predicted promoters, i.e. 500 bp genomic regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of either merozoite- or tachyzoite-specific genes. listed in figure 7a are the five most significantly enriched 6 bp motifs found. pattern matching between these enriched motifs produced an amalgamated seven-base dna motif in both merozoite- and tachyzoite-specific gene promoters, representing putative cis-regulatory elements . the gaagaaa motif, present in  <dig> % of merozoite promoters, was also present in  <dig> % of tachyzoite promoters, indicating that this motif is unlikely to represent a merozoite-specific cis-regulatory element . however, the gagacgc motif is clearly enriched in the promoters of tachyzoite-specific genes  over merozoite-specific genes . the distribution of this putative cis-regulatory element in the predicted promoters of the  <dig> most tachyzoite-specific genes is illustrated in figure 7e. this motif is nearly identical to a motif  previously identified as a functional cis-element in the promoters of dense granule genes, such as tggra <dig>  tggra <dig>  tggra <dig> and tggra <dig>  as well as the tachyzoite marker, tgsrs29b   <cit> . a sequence-specific transcription factor capable of activating gene transcription via this cis element has yet to be identified; however, it may play a significant role in promoting and/or maintaining a tachyzoite developmental state.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data support a correlation between promiscuity of invasion and dissemination of the t. gondii parasite in a variety of host cells and tissues. in addition, the data presented here underscore the phenomenon of non-overlapping stage-specific expression of gene sets throughout development  as previously proposed  <cit>  within the toxoplasma life cycle  <cit> . hence, the differentiation of bradyzoites into merozoites, which occurs only in the feline intestine, entails the shut down or downregulation of suites of tachyzoite-specific genes that would normally be activated to support toxoplama’s promiscuous ability to invade and reproduce asexually in virtually any nucleated cell from essentially any warm-blooded animal. this study provides compelling datasets to begin to explore the suites of genes activated to support merozoite invasion, differentiation, and expansion in cat enterocytes and establishes t. gondii as an excellent genetically-amenable model system to study schizont asexual amplification prior to gamete development, the hallmark of coccidian development in the definitive hosts these coccidian parasites infect. our data suggest that gliding motility and the formation of a moving junction  requires machinery that is specifically adapted to breaching the enterocyte surface barrier for every cycle of replication, egress and invasion. studies of the srs proteins exclusively expressed during coccidian development will determine if these proteins promote attachment and invasion of feline enterocytes, or whether they participate in gamete-gamete recognition to promote fertilization, analogous to the orthologous role performed by related 6-cys family proteins during plasmodium development  <cit> . understanding the governance of gene expression and regulation within these families, e.g. via interactions with the tgap <dig> family of transcriptional regulators, may prove key to dissecting the full panorama of pathways that regulate the definitive coccidian lifecycle and aid in the complete and accurate annotation of the t. gondii genome database.
