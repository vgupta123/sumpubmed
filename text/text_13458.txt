BACKGROUND
francisella tularensis  is a gram-negative bacterium that causes the zoonosis tularemia  <cit> . due to its high infectivity it is considered as a class a bioweapon agent  <cit> . f. tularensis primarily infects and persists in macrophages and is thus used as model bacterium to study adopted strategies to evade primary immune detection  <cit> . as human infections with f. tularensis and related human clinical trials are rare, most of the data available on mechanisms of f. tularensis replication are derived from mouse models  <cit> . however, due to interspecies differences in the immune response and opposing evolutionary strategies for resistance vs. tolerance or resilience to infection  <cit>  it remains difficult to extrapolate results obtained in animal models to the human situation  <cit> .

currently, four subspecies  of f. tularensis are generally accepted: ssp. tularensis, holarctica, mediasiatica, and novicida. f. tularensis ssp. tularensis is highly virulent in hares and the cause of type a tularemia, whereas f. tularensis ssp. holarctica is less virulent and causes type b tularemia; f. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica is a rare pathogen with unique biochemical characteristics that has only been isolated in kazakhstan and turkmenistan in central asia and exhibits virulence in hares similar to type b organisms  <cit> . since the infectious dose of f. tularensis wild type strains is very low, the attenuated type b live vaccine strain  thus has often been used as surrogate for the virulent strains. the lvs strain is able to induce diseases in mice similar to those seen in humans, but possesses practically no risk for laboratory personnel . both, virulent and attenuated strains of f. tularensis, survive macrophage phagocytosis. they escape into the cytoplasm by preventing acidification and maturation of the phagosome .

kupffer cells represent specialized tissue macrophages within the liver  <cit>  and account for  <dig> – 90 % of the total macrophage pool of the body  <cit> . in response to f. tularensis infection, several morphological alterations of the liver tissue have been observed  <cit> . in this context, it has been supposed that hepatocytes as well as dendritic cells may support the intracellular replication of f. tularensis without undergoing pyroptosis or apoptosis. moreover, f. tularensis is assumed to delay induction of cell death in host cells to its own advantage until exit from its intracellular environment  <cit> .

so far, there is only little knowledge about the infection and replication cycles of f. tularensis within human liver tissue. to investigate these processes in vitro, we co-cultured primary human monocyte-derived macrophages with the recently developed hepatocyte cell line heparg, which differentiates into cells with a hepatocyte phenotype and into cells exhibiting a biliary epithelial cell phenotype  <cit> . in contrast to other hepatic cells lines, i.e. hepg <dig> or hep2/c3a, heparg cells remain functionally stable during prolonged culture, self-organize with functional bile canaliculi-like structures and respond to inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . using this human macrophage / hepatocyte co-culture approach we characterized the infection and replication of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica, spp. mediasiatica and the attenuated lvs strain.

RESULTS
to characterize the impact of hepatocytes on the intracellular replication rate of f. tularensis in mono-cell cultures of macrophages or hepatocytes as well as in macrophage/hepatocyte co-cultures, cells were infected with f. tularensis and cultured up to 72 h. the f. tularensis replication rate was measured by flow cytometry using an anti- f. tularensis lipopolysaccharide  antibody to detect intracellular bacteria. macrophages were discriminated from hepatocytes in the flow cytometric analyses by combined gating of fsc/ssc scattering and fluorescence measurement of fitc-labeled antibody directed against the leukocyte marker protein cd <dig>  f. tularensis ssp. holarctica and lvs strain were reliably detected in macrophages and hepatocytes. although it has been concluded from previous studies that all three f. tularensis ssp. possess a common lps lipid a structure  <cit> , we were unable to detect intracellular lps after infection with f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica. however, presence and replication of intracellular viable bacteria in the hepatocyte / macrophages co-culture of all three f. tularensis strains were confirmed by colony forming unit  assays from lysates of infected cells .fig.  <dig> quantification of colony forming units from cell lysates of macrophage /hepatocyte  co-cultures  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h after infection with f. tularensis lvs, spp. holarctica or spp. mediasiatica plated on cysteine heart agar dishes. data of one representative experiment out of a series of  <dig> independent experiments for each time point and f. tularensis strain is shown



replication of f. tularensis lvs strain and f. tularensis ssp. holarctica was confirmed in monocultures of macrophages and in hepatocytes  as well as in the co-culture of both cell types . interestingly, the highest lps content was detected in co-cultures with the lowest macrophage content of 6 % in the co-culture  . an increase in the macrophage content in the cell cultures resulted in a diminished lps signal reflecting first, f. tularensis preferentially enter macrophages compared to hepatocytes, and second, in consequence bacterial moi per individual macrophage cell is reduced in the co-culture.fig.  <dig> detection of intracellular lps and cell death in macrophage  / hepatocyte  co-cultures infected with lvs , spp. holarctica  or spp. mediasiatica  and untreated control . a-b flow cytometric  detection of intracellular francisella tularensis by detection of lps in a macrophages and b hepatocytes in the mono-cell culture  and co-culture  ; c fold change of increase in cell death in macrophages  and hepatocytes  compared to untreated control in the co-culture; d percentage of detectable macrophages in the co-culture 72 h after infection without  and with incubation of lvs strain , f. tularensis holarctica  or f. tularensis mediasiatica . statistical significance was calculated using student’s t-test 



the strong increase in replication rate of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica in macrophages and hepatocytes in the co-culture compared with respective mono-cell cultures, indicates a supportive function of hepatocytes for bacterial replication . furthermore, we observed an increased proportion of dead macrophages infected with the lvs strain and f. tularensis ssp. holarctica in the co-culture after 72 h, whereas at the same time point f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica induced a significant onset of cell death preferentially in hepatocytes, but not in macrophages . an analysis of the total percentage of macrophages revealed that infection with all three f. tularensis strains resulted in a significantly diminished macrophage numbers after 72 h in the co-culture. a comparative analysis with different proportions of macrophages in the co-culture revealed that a decline of present macrophages correlated with the detected lps signal confirming bacterial infection and related subsequent cell death . thus, in the subsequent experiments co-cultures of 6 % macrophage and 94 % hepatocytes were used to enable sufficient bacterial infection rate and allowing an efficient study of the related cellular response. under these conditions the observed loss of detectable macrophages in response to bacterial infection was most prominent in cell cultures infected with lvs and f. tularensis ssp. holarctica compared to f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica .

induction of apoptosis in macrophages in response to infection with all three f. tularensis strains was detected in the co-cultures with hepatocytes at the level of cleaved caspase- <dig>  in these assays, infection with f. tularensis ssp. holarctica caused the highest rate of apoptosis induction in macrophages 24 h and 72 h post infection .fig.  <dig>

it has been demonstrated in mice that after 16 h of intravenous infection with f. tularensis infectious foci in liver tissue are formed and accompanied by infiltration of both neutrophils and monocytes  <cit> . infected mice developed typical signs of hepatitis within 24–72 h post infection  <cit>  and during this period, pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin -1β, il- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor  α were secreted at the active sites of infection . to characterize the inflammatory response in our humanized co-culture model the secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to f. tularensis infection was measured in the supernatant of the cell culture by cytometric bead arrays . in addition, the release of fractalkine , a chemokine that controls the survival of invading monocytes and their differentiation into functionally diverse macrophage subsets upon liver injury  <cit>  was analyzed by cba. in chronic liver injury fkn elicits liver protective functions via its receptor cx3cr <dig> by promoting hepatic macrophage survival and restriction of pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization  <cit> .

we observed a robust and sustained inflammatory response upon infection with all three f. tularensis strains up to 72 h after infection. tnfα and il-1β levels were highest 24 h after infection and subsequently declined in the further course of culture . a release of il- <dig> was similarly triggered by infection with all francisella strains after 24 h. whereas il- <dig> levels declined in f. tularensis ssp. holarctica and ssp. mediasiatica infected co-cultures up to 72 h, il- <dig> levels remained stable upon infection with the lvs strain . in contrast to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnfα, il-1β and il- <dig>  the release of fkn increased from 24 h up to 72 h post infection . interestingly, fkn release negatively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine release in a time-dependent as well as strain-specific manner, indicating that the release of the fkn chemokine negatively correlates with f. tularensis-mediated inflammation response. among all three f. tularensis strains tested, f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica infection induced the secretion of only low fkn levels but high amounts of tnfα and il-1β were secreted relative to the lvs strain and f. tularensis ssp. holarctica.fig.  <dig> cytokine secretion by macrophage/hepatocyte co-cultures of a tnfα, b il-1β, c il- <dig> and d fractalkine  in response to infection with lvs , spp. holarctica  or spp. mediasiatica  or untreated control  after  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h of cell culture. statistical significance was calculated using student’s t-test: *** p <  <dig>  compared to identical time point after infection with lvs; ### p <  <dig>  compared to identical time point after infection with spp. holarctica




f. tularensis attempts to evade the primary immune response by intracellular replication  <cit> . to study whether its presence in the cell culture is masked to suspended immune cells, we co-incubated infected cells with human white blood cells  seeded in a transwell filter above the co-cultures. in this setting we were not able to detect a significant number of migrating and adhesive leukocytes to the infected cell cultures. only small amounts of less than 5 % migrating granulocytes were detectable  in naïve and infected cell cultures, but without significant differences in respect to cell numbers . although secretion of tnfα and il-1β was increased, we found only minor alterations of the time- or strain-dependent il-6- and fkn-release  in presence of co-incubated wbc.fig.  <dig> white blood cell  migration and cytokine secretion by macrophage  / hepatocyte  cultures co-incubated with  <dig> x <dig> wbc in a transwell filter insert. a percentage of detected cd68b positive granulocytes by flow cytometry  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h post infection. cytokine secretion of b tnfα, c il-1β, d il- <dig> and e fractalkine  in response to infection with lvs , spp. holarctica  or spp. mediasiatica  or untreated control  after  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h of cell culture. statistical significance was calculated using student’s t-test: * p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig>  compared to identical time point after infection with lvs; # p <  <dig> , ### p <  <dig>  compared to identical time point after infection with spp. holarctica




discussion
it has been suggested that hepatocytes as well as dendritic cells support the intracellular replication of f. tularensis without undergoing pyroptosis or apoptosis  <cit> . we could confirm this concept derived from the mouse models in the human cell culture model for the virulent subspecies f. tularensis mediasiatica but not for the subspecies holarctica or the attenuated lvs strain. in the human co-culture model we could detect a significant loss of macrophages infected with f. tularensis ssp. holarctica and the lvs strain, whereas the percentage of viable macrophages only slightly decreased after infection with f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica.

f. tularensis is presumed to delay induction of cell death in host cells to its own advantage until exit from its intracellular environment  <cit> . f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica was found to efficiently adopt this strategy by preventing macrophage cell death in order to allow efficient replication rates. it was shown that infection of the macrophage-like j <dig> cell line with lvs results in apoptosis  <cit> . however, the number of bacterial burden was not affected. in this context, a role of the caspase-3-mediated cell death in favoring bacterial dissemination was assumed, but this mechanism is restricted to tissues in which macrophages play a central role in pathogen uptake and killing, such as the liver  <cit> . in mice, death of animals infected with f. tularensis appears to result from widespread sepsis and inflammation , and mortality was correlated with the extent of the inflammatory response  <cit>  including release of pro-inflammatory il- <dig>  an early diagnostic marker of bacterial sepsis  <cit> .

we observed the strongest pro-inflammatory response upon infection with f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica that also induced the highest rate of apoptosis in the co-culture model of all tested f. tularensis strains. we further observed a reduced level of fkn, a chemokine released by cleavage from hepatocytes upon inflammation  <cit>  and that is able to counteract liver inflammation  <cit>  in response to f. tularensis ssp. mediasiatica infection. in mice, lethal infection with f. tularensis is associated with hypercytokinemia and biochemical markers for sepsis . this sepsis is assumed to result from delayed cytokine up-regulation and insufficient recruitment of inflammatory cells  <cit> . although we observed a slight increase of tnfα and il-1β secretion upon wbc co-incubation, no effects on il- <dig> release were observed. based on the diminished immune response of co-incubated wbc we conclude that intracellular bacteria are mainly hidden from wbc, which impedes an efficient bacterial clearance.

on one hand, the observed high rate of apoptosis induction in macrophages infected with f. tularensis provides the host with the advantage of early elimination of infected cells and removal of microbial replication niches. on the other hand, the extensive cell death of tissue macrophages, which is a hallmark of virulent f. tularensis infection  <cit> , and the reduced recruitment of phagocytes to the sites of infection favors the dissemination of bacteria and diminishes important innate immune responses  <cit> . this double-edged sword needs to be tightly regulated by the host to ensure an efficient host defense against f. tularensis infection.

CONCLUSIONS
we could demonstrate that f. tularensis infection and related cellular immune response can be investigated in a human cell co-culture model of monocyte-derived macrophages and hepatocytes. this co-culture model depicts strain-specific virulence and the associated pathogenic potential of the tested f. tularensis strains. using this model we could demonstrate that f. tularensis strains efficiently hide and replicate in macrophages depending on their virulent potential and thereby avoid detection by co-incubated wbc and subsequent aggravated immune response. we believe that the cell co-culture approach presented herein is a valuable tool for further, more detailed in vitro studies of f. tularensis pathophysiology. the potential of this co-culture models to study other intracellular persisting pathogens affecting the human liver will be characterized in further studies.
