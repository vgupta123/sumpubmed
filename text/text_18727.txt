BACKGROUND
non-coding rna  constitutes a significant portion of the mammalian transcriptome . although a large sub-class of long ncrnas  is spliced, capped, and polyadenylated, and thus differs from their protein-coding siblings only in coding capacity  <cit> , these mrna-like lncrnas account for only a small fraction of the striking diversity of transcripts. nuclear retained ncrnas are often spliced transcripts but not polyadenylated. these “dark matter rnas”, which have remained largely un-annotated so far, can in fact be the dominating non-ribosomal rna component in a mammalian cell  <cit> .

as a class, lncrnas are under purifying selection  although the level of sequence conservation is typically very low  <cit> . comparative transcriptomics  <cit>  as well as computational studies  <cit>  showed that between one and two thirds of human lncrnas are conserved among eutheria, emphasizing the functional importance of these transcripts. the catalogs of rnas used in these studies are, however, heavily biased towards spliced rnas, and some of them use the conservation of splice sites explicitly as a means to assess conservation . indeed, the overwhelming majority of lncrnas for which detailed functional information is available is spliced, see e.g.  <cit> , although splicing often tends to occur only after transcription and is less efficient  <cit> .

by far the largest class of unspliced transcripts for which a function is known are the intron-less protein-coding genes. in human, they account for about  <dig>  % of the protein-coding loci  <cit> . they have received comparably little attention even though they have distinctive features e.g. related to their export pathways  <cit> . on average they are expressed at lower levels, tend to be more tissue specific, evolve at faster rates, and are of relatively recent origins  <cit> . the extremely well-conserved replication-dependent histone genes form a distinctive class of intron-less genes set apart by their unique 3’ end processing  <cit> .

unspliced lncrnas fall into at least four distinct classes:  intronic transcripts typically associated with protein-coding loci,  lncrnas associated with long 3’-utrs,  independent unspliced rnas found in intergenic regions, and  an enigmatic class of very long macrornas.

totally and partially intronic transcripts  that are usually unspliced and lack coding capacity have been reported in large numbers for both human and mouse . this class includes many unspliced long anti-sense intronic rnas  <cit> . not much is known on the biogenesis of intronic lncrnas, although there are presumably multiple pathways. the anti-sense tin anrassf <dig> is a pol-ii transcript, capped, and polyadenylated  <cit> . sense tins, on the other hand, might also be processing products generated from introns as described for the sisrnas in frog oocytes  <cit> . intronic transcripts appear to have primarily regulatory functions, for which they employ several different molecular mechanisms  <cit> . lncrnas can affect gene expression both in cis and in trans by modulating the chromatin structure  <cit> . although the first reports that rna is an integral component of chromatin date back to the 1970s  <cit>  there has not been much work on chromatin-associated rnas . they are largely non-polyadenylated  <cit>  and derive from both intronic and intergenic regions  <cit> . some of them are probably natural antisense transcripts  deriving from both coding and non-coding loci that act in cis as epigenetic regulators of gene expression and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . furthermore rnp complexes stably tethered to chromatin were characterized recently that appear to play a role in regulating higher order structures of chromatin  <cit> . many promoter-associated long ncrnas  <cit>  might also function via chromatin modification  <cit> .

the 3’ untranslated regions  of eukaryotic genes are well known to harbor sequence and secondary structure elements that regulate mrna stability, localization, and translation . many 3’utrs in animals can also be decoupled from the protein-coding part forming so-called utr-associated rnas , which appear to function as non-coding rnas in trans  <cit> . note that the abbreviation uarna was later also used for the unrelated class of “upstream antisense rnas” in  <cit> . in the form of independent uarnas, they are often detectable as unspliced ests. a recent study, furthermore, found parallels in sequence composition between lncrnas and 3’ utrs that sets both groups apart from 5’utrs and coding regions  <cit> . since 3’utrs typically harbor microrna target sites they may function as sponges for micrornas  <cit>  or rna binding proteins  <cit> .

the best-known examples of “intergenic” unspliced ncrnas are malat- <dig> and men β, which organize nuclear structures known as sc <dig> speckles and paraspeckles, respectively . both transcripts are spliced only infrequently  <cit>  and are rather well-conserved  <cit> . this class also contains important disease-associated rnas such as prncr <dig>  <cit> .

macrornas covering up to several hundred kb were recently observed as highly expressed rnas in signaling pathways  <cit>  and in cancer cells  <cit> . very similar transcripts such as airn  <cit>  and kcnq1ot <dig>  <cit>  are involved in the regulation of imprinted loci. these enigmatic rnas are very poorly conserved.

despite the wealth of unspliced est data that is available in public databases, they have received little attention as a source of information on non-coding rnas apart from a seminal work  <cit> . in part this is probably due the difficulties involved in mining this resource. first, strand information is usually not available and the absence of splice junctions makes it impossible to guess the reading direction. furthermore, a detailed analysis of nearly  <dig>  putative ncrnas from riken’s fantom transcript data set showed that many of the putative intronic and intergenic transcripts might be artifacts and in fact are internally primed subsequences from even longer transcripts  <cit> . the fragmentary nature of ests, furthermore, makes it difficult and often impossible to reliably determine transcript boundaries.

in this contribution we use unspliced est data to obtain an overview of the unspliced transcripts in the human and the mouse genome. we focus on ests rather than ngs data here primarily because the much longer est sequences are largely mapped unambiguously to the genome and are much more likely to contain splice junctions when they originate from spliced transcripts than the much shorted ngs reads. we update and extend previous investigations in the human uest data  <cit>  and in particular provide a first overview of the similarities and differences of the situation in human and mouse.

RESULTS
ests “within range” of refseq genes
the majority of unspliced est  clusters,  <dig> % in both human and mouse, overlaps with or lies in the vicinity of annotated refseq genes. a possible reason for this strong association with known pre-existing annotation could be that uest cluster are just by-products of “normal” spliced transcripts arising from occasionally inefficient splicing or a background of not yet processed primary transcripts. we therefore compare the amount of spliced and unspliced ests with the range of annotated refseq genes , see additional file 1: figure s <dig> for human and additional file 1: figure s <dig> for mouse. the amount of ests is a measure that interpolates between diversity of tissues and conditions under which the locus is expressed  and a genuine proxy for expression levels . despite its aggregate nature, the correlation of the amount of spliced and unspliced ests is indicative of the overall coupling between spliced and unspliced expression. we observe a pearson correlation coefficient of r= <dig>  and r= <dig>  for spliced and unspliced refseq genes in human and r= <dig>  and r= <dig>  in mouse gene, respectively. the correlation coefficients are rather moderate, however, reaching roughly the level of correlation between mrna and protein abundances, see e.g.  <cit> . we take this as a strong indication that the observed unspliced est clusters are not just a byproduct. the quantitative data suggest that a considerable fraction of unspliced transcripts is independent of spliced genes.

we analyzed the relative location of unspliced ests and components of refseq genes in detail to elucidate their relationships, see fig.  <dig>  compared to a similar analysis  we now a have much larger data set of totally intronic  unspliced est cluster, comprising  <dig>   but nearly the same amount of partially intronic ,  <dig>  . the number of reported tins has increased by a factor of  <dig> , while the known pins increased only by about  <dig> %, suggesting that the coverage of tins is much farther from saturation than that of the pins. while  <cit>  and our previous study  <cit>  were concerned with the human transcriptome only, we consider here a comparable data set for the mouse .
fig.  <dig> classification of unspliced est cluster w.r.t. their location relative to refseq genes. with the exception of totally intronic rnas  and cluster in the upstream  and downstream  region within  <dig> kb, all other classes partially overlap refseq exons: 5’ and 3’ partially intronic rnas , est cluster overlapping 3’utr and downstream region  or 5’utr and upstream region , resp., and cluster covering complete introns indicating retained introns  are distinguished in the statistical analysis. furthermore, we record totally exonic cluster  and the intergenic clusters  that are unrelated to refseq loci. the bar plots above and below the scheme summarize the numbers of unspliced est for each cluster type in human  and mouse . the venn diagram below lists the exact numbers. about one fifth of the unspliced est clusters  cannot be classified unambiguously because they are overlapped by more than one refseq gene and would fall into different classes with respect to these, see subsection classification in the methods part for details. these ambiguous clusters are not included here

aunspliced est cluster overlapping 5’ utr have been excluded for this analysis



the protein-coding part of refseq genes overlaps  <dig>  unspliced est cluster . less than  <dig> % of these cluster in each species, however, are located completely in the coding region. we analyze not only uests overlapping the gene body but take into account the vicinity of refseq genes, defined as within  <dig> kb of the ends of the refseq entry. there are  <dig>  unspliced est cluster in upstream region of human  refseq genes and  <dig>  downstream, see fig.  <dig>  conversely,  <dig>  of  <dig>   of the annotated refseq genes  overlap with at least one unspliced est cluster.

independent utr-derived rnas
unspliced est  cluster are predominately expressed in the 3’ region of refseq genes. there are more than  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse uest clusters that overlap the 3’utr or are located within  <dig> nt downstream of 3’end of a refseq genes. the frequent observation of these downstream signals is consistent with the observation that the length of utrs is often underestimated in current gene annotations  <cit> . alternative polyadenylation, and hence often dramatic changes in 3’utr length, furthermore appear to be frequent phenomenon that may have biased the current gene annotations . unfortunately, we can not rule out that unspliced est clusters of the class 3’r are only artifacts of the read-through of transcripts from the upstream gene. therefore, we attempt to use cage data to gain additional evidence of the 3’r cluster to be independently transcribed or processed, for instance similar to uarnas.

cage tags  <cit>  are routinely used to assay caped 5’ ends. the fantom  <dig> consortium predicted tss peaks by clustering cage tags  <cit> . these peaks can be used to predict the reading direction of an unspliced est cluster if they are located at one of the ends of the cluster.  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the predicted tss peaks  overlap with a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   uest clusters.we are primarily interested in the tss peaks from the forward strand that are located close to the beginning of the est cluster, and in the tss peaks from the reverse strand that are located close to the end of the est cluster. the reading direction of an est cluster can be determined unambiguously provided it contains exactly one of these two types of tss peaks. as in previous work  <cit> , we use  <dig> nt from either end of the est cluster as distance cutoff. we obtained  <dig> forward and  <dig> reverse strand uest cluster in human and  <dig> forward and  <dig> reverse in mouse. for  <dig> cluster in human and  <dig> mouse we found tss peaks at both ends. these cases are likely bi-directionally transcribed loci. we nevertheless excluded them from further analysis, summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

most of them correspond to the 5’ end or to 5’ extensions of refseq genes. we excluded them in the further analysis since we can not distinguish the transcription start site  of the corresponding refseq gene and an independent one of an unspliced est cluster, see table  <dig> 

the majority  of the remaining clusters, share the reading direction of the corresponding gene. some of these unspliced cluster may correspond to a class of transcribed promoter-associated ncrnas similar to the ccnd1-pncrnas  <cit> , which negatively regulate ccnd <dig> transcription by recruiting tls to the promoter.

enhancer rnas are a class of non-coding rnas that has recently gained considerable interest . they are expressed from enhancer regions. since these are not annotated as  genes, we analyzed whether intergenic unspliced est cluster might correspond to enhancer rnas. to this end we used a set of  <dig>  predicted human enhancer rnas compiled in  <cit>  as part of the fantom  <dig> project. however, only  <dig> of  <dig>  human igr uest cluster overlap with one of these enhancer rnas.

cell-specific expression
the cage data collected by the fantom consortium can even be used to analyze the cell-specific expression of unspliced est  cluster. ohmiya et al.  <cit>  used the fantom  <dig> dataset to predict transcriptions start sites  in  <dig> different human primary cells. overlapping these tss with the uest clusters provides us with an overview of cell-specific expression patterns of many uest cluster.

for  <dig> uest cluster on the forward and  <dig> on the reverse strand a cell-type-specific expression can be detected. most clusters  are expressed in less than  <dig> cell lines, see table  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  in total there are  <dig> uest cluster overlapping or being in close vicinity to a gene and  <dig> from intergenic regions . for the more cell-type specific cases  their relative distribution is quite similar. on the other end of the spectrum there are  <dig>  gene-associated uest cluster expressed in equal or more than  <dig> cell lines. there is only a single intergenic cluster which is expressed in  <dig> cell lines. this is not surprising since very abundant transcripts are unlikely to have escaped all efforts to annotate human genes.


we performed the same analysis for all refseq genes as well as long non-coding rnas  from gencode v <dig> filtered for high reliability, see additional file  <dig>  the distribution of refseq genes is similar to the unspliced est cluster, although more uest clusters are expressed in very few tissues and there are fewer nearly ubiquitously expressed uest clusters compared to protein coding genes. the lncrnas lack the peak for ubiquitous expression completely, consistent with previous observations that lncrnas are expressed less abundantly and more specifically compared to traditional transcripts  <cit> .

we tried to use the cell-specific cage data to find cell types with an enrichment for uarnas. using all  <dig> cell types, normalized for the amount of predicted tss per cell type, there is, however, no enrichment detectable for any particular cell type. we then combined related cell types into larger groups but, again, no group-wise enrichment’s were visible.

chromatin architecture
cage is a method developed for exactly determining the 5’-end of rnas. a more indirect way to detect the transcription start site  of a gene is analyzing the chromatin structure.

we used a genome-segmentation track based on encode data provided by ref.  <cit>  based on a computational methods for unsupervised chromatin state annotation from chip-seq data for multiple histone modifications, general transcription factors, and chromatin accessibility assays. while the chromatin elements were computed independently for six different cell lines in  <cit>  we combined all cell lines here since the definition of the est clusters is also a composite of many different cell and tissue types.

more than  <dig> % of the clusters close to or within annotated genes but outside of exons  overlap a segment predicted to be transcriptionally active  based on chromatin state in at least one cell line. although we know, of course, that unspliced est clusters are transcribed regions, it is reassuring that the chromatin data show a consistent picture. in particular for ut and dt uest clusters it is impossible to discern in most cases whether they are independent transcripts or processing products, or whether they belong to large, splice transcripts whose utrs are annotated only incompletely.

small inaccuracies in gene annotation are not relevant for unspliced est cluster in intergenic region  which are at least 5000nt away from the next annotated gene. in total  <dig> intergenic cluster overlap regions annotated to be transcriptionally active. seven hundred and thirty-three with words of them intersect predicted ‘tss’, see table  <dig> for detailed count statistics.


utr-associated rnas
utr-associated rnas  are identified by accumulations of cage tags, i.e., transcription start sites  or re-capping sites, that are independent of the underlying genes. detectable uarnas overlap with the 3’utr of their surrounding gene. conceivably, 5’-uarnas might also exist. however, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the tss  of the surrounding gene from the 5’-end of an embedded uarna. in contrast, cage tags towards the 3’-end of a transcript exclude most or all of the coding sequence or the major part of a lncrna, hence strongly suggesting a distinct transcript. operationally, uarna candidates are defined as unspliced est clusters that overlap a predicted tss and the 3’utr of a refseq gene but not its 5’utr. using tss predicted by chromatin data as described above we identify in total of  <dig> bona fide uarna candidates in human. relying on tss predicted by the fantom  <dig> consortium using cage tags  <cit>  there are  <dig> uarna candidates in human and  <dig> in mouse. four hundred and twelve of the uarna candidates in human are detected simultaneously by chromatin data and cage data. of these,  <dig> have an ortholog unspliced est cluster in mouse. unfortunately, comprehensive chromatin data sets are not available for mouse.

unannotated intergenic est clusters
 <dig>  human and  <dig> mouse uest clusters are located more then  <dig> kb away from any refseq gene. in human  <dig> of these overlap non-refseq annotated mrnas. removing these leaves  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse candidates of novel, predominantly unspliced genes.

recent retropseudogenes  <cit>  may lead to mapping artifacts since ests might be mapped erroneously to the intron-free locus instead of a spliced alignment to the locus of the functional gene. although revived retrogenes exist and can be functional  <cit>  they cannot be distinguished reliably from mapping artifacts. hence we compared the sequences of the cluster against the “retroposed genes, including pseudogenes”-track from ucsc genome browser in order to identify and remove such cases from further analysis. seven hundred and sixty loci  of the candidates are identified as deriving from protein-coding genes. in the mouse data set, the relative number is higher:  <dig>  of the candidates show significant similarities from coding genes. the majority of the remaining unknown transcripts are probably long extensions of 3’utrs of spliced genes. in many of these cases we might be seeing uarnas.

to further investigate the  <dig> intergenic unspliced est cluster that were not recognized as likely retrogenes, we used rnaz  <dig>   <cit>  to detect signatures of purifying selection on rna secondary structure and rnacode  <cit>  to find evidence for conserved protein-coding regions. we used multiple genome alignments taken from the ucsc genome browser as input. this data set covers  <dig> , <dig> nt and yields  <dig> rnaz hits with a classification probability prnaz> <dig>  and  <dig> with prnaz> <dig> . in mouse the  <dig> , <dig> nt are covering  <dig> rnaz hits with a classification probability prnaz> <dig>  and  <dig> with prnaz> <dig> . compared to the predicted  <dig> low confidence and  <dig> high confidence hits in the  <dig> mb long encode regions  <cit> , the human result amounts to a very moderate enrichment by a factor of  <dig> . it remains unclear whether this enrichment is confounded e.g. by the restriction of unspliced est cluster to genomic regions with relatively high expression. the enrichment of structured rna elements could be interpreted as hinting at a function of long unspliced regions in specific binding with proteins. an example for a conserved secondary structure element is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

using rnacode, we detected  <dig> regions with a p-value prnacode< <dig>  in human. two hundred and thirty-two of these regions have a length of at least  <dig> nucleotides. in mouse there are  <dig> regions with a p-value prnacode< <dig> . two hundred and sixty-five have a length of at least  <dig> nt. shorter regions mostly appear to be artifacts caused by short segments of coding region in retrogenes.

overlapping all unspliced est cluster with a recent version of gencode lncrnas  we noticed that  <dig>  % of human and  <dig>  % of mouse uest cluster overlap with annotated lncrnas. interestingly, human intergenic cluster are enriched in this set . in mouse, the  <dig> igr cluster  overlapping gencode lncrnas closely matches the relative amount of igr uest cluster. the specific increase in human might be due to a better annotation compared to mouse.

human intergenic unspliced est cluster are the class with the most cluster that are not found to be expressed by the encode rna-seq data  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  % of all human unspliced est cluster are supported by rna-seq data, defined as being covered by at least  <dig> reads of encode rna-seq data.  <dig>  of  <dig> cluster in total that are not covered, belong to the class igr, the numbers for all classes can be found in additional file 1: table s <dig>  this indicates that this class contains a higher amount of low expressed genes that are more difficult to detect.

conservation
pairwise orthology
the first publication on unspliced est analysis  <cit>  focused just on the human genome. the motivation for including mouse data is to get an evolutionary perspective. after detecting unspliced est cluster in both, human and mouse, we are able to predict evolutionary conserved ones. unfortunately, for most parts of the data we could not find a homologous cluster. this is either the case if there is no homologous region detected by liftover, see subsection conservation in the methods part for more information, or if there is no unspliced est cluster in the homologous region. both cases sum up to  <dig> % of human and  <dig> % of the mouse unspliced est cluster, see fig.  <dig>  there are  <dig>  unspliced est cluster conserved between human and mouse. of the conserved cluster,  <dig> are classified in the same class, according to fig.  <dig>   <dig> belong to a different class in both species, see additional file 1: figure s <dig> 
fig.  <dig> using the pairwise alignments of human and mouse we could detect  <dig>  pairs of unspliced est cluster which are conserved. the pairs consist of  <dig>  different cluster from human and  <dig>  from mouse. five thousand, three hundred and eighty-eight pairs are between cluster which are classified in the same class, see fig.  <dig> for details about classification.  <dig>   of  <dig>  unspliced est cluster in human and  <dig>   of  <dig>  in mouse can not be associated with an homologous unspliced est cluster in the other species



unsurprisingly, the class totally exonic  comprises the most conserved cluster . one reason for that is the fact that detection of conservation between already known genes is much easier. the same goes for totally intronic  cluster, see additional file 1: figure s <dig> for an example. however, we also found  <dig> conserved intergenic cluster. one example can be seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig>   <dig> of the conserved uest cluster in human and  <dig> in mouse overlap regions previously shown to have enhancer activity from the vista enhancer browser. the conservation between human and mouse implicitly hints at functional transcripts that have to be protected from harmful mutations.

sequence conservation
a more global view on the sequence conservation of the unspliced est cluster can be gained by using multiz alignments from the ucsc genome browser. in our analysis we use both the 100way-alignment with human as reference and the 60way mouse-centered alignment. for both of them phastcons scores  <cit> , which indicate the level of conservation of the reference species, are available through the ucsc genome browser. the phastcons scores, which are in the range between  <dig> and  <dig>  represent probabilities of negative selection. the underlying model corrects for base composition.

to be able to interpret the results for unspliced est cluster we also analyzed the average sequence conservation of introns, the entire genome and exons, as well as a background set comprising all those refseq genes in which we detected uest clusters. most classes of unspliced est cluster exhibit an increased level of average sequence conservation compared to the genomic background, see fig.  <dig>  in the case of tex cluster one should notice that only a minority of them  is located completely in coding sequence . the remaining part is just partly or not at all overlapping cds. this explains the lower average phastcons score of tex compared to exons. a small increase in conservation levels is visible in particular also for 5r and 3r uests compared to the annotated 5’- and 3’-utrs in the refseq-based background set. only for tins we could not detect a significant extra conservation. however this might be due to the difficulties of defining a comparable genomic background considering the fact that the conservation of introns is quite heterogeneous. figure  <dig> also conveys a comparison of the situation in human and mouse, showing the sequence conservation levels are globally very similar between human and mouse.
fig.  <dig> mean phastcons scores for the different classes of uest clusters , compared to the average conservation of introns, the entire genome and  exons. avg is the average of all uest classes. tex uests are particularly heterogeneous, hence they were also subdivided into three subclasses indicated as triangles . blue stars refer to a background set comprising only those refseq genes in which we detected uest clusters



CONCLUSIONS
unspliced est data, although typically disregarded in transcriptome analysis, can provide interesting insights into the structure of human transcriptomes. they outline a major component of transcriptional output that totally or at least partially escapes splicing. nevertheless, this valuable resource has not been mined comprehensively in the past. so far, only the partially and totally intronic transcripts , which constitute more than half of the clusters of unspliced ests, have received attention in systematic studies . our analysis confirmed the conclusions drawn from the literature on these abundant class of transcripts in human and mouse. in addition, we find direct evidence of the independent transcription of pins and tins based on cage tag and chromatin data. several promising candidates for previously unknown long rnas could be found.

many of the unspliced est clusters form extensions of the utrs of well-annotated genes. on the 5’-side they provide additional information about the transcriptional start sites  of the annotated refseq genes themselves. not surprisingly, the majority of clusters with clear support for a tss from cage data fall into this class. more interestingly, however, the relative majority of utr extensions is located at the 3’-end of refseq genes and forms typically extensive, several kb-long extensions. in line with  <cit> , many of these 3’utr extensions contain a tss for an independently transcribed uarna. we identify  <dig> likely uarnas in human and  <dig> in mouse with strong support from the cage data. in addition  <dig> uarna candidates in human were detected using chromatin data. four hundred and twelve candidates in human were predicted by both methods and  <dig> of them have an ortholog cluster in mouse.

cage data was also used to analyze the expression in  <dig> different primary human cell types. most of the unspliced est cluster are expressed in less than  <dig> different cell types, while only a small fraction of very abundant ones in expressed in all cell types. this distribution is similar to that of known refseq genes but more skewed towards specifically expressed loci.

this suggest that hundreds or even thousands of the 3’utr extensions are est clusters overlapping the 3’utr of a refseq gene but originate rather from independent transcripts than a single 3’utr. in fact,  <dig> cluster overlapping 3’utr and downstream region of a gene and a similar number of dt uest clusters carry histone marks characteristic for tss, see table  <dig>  in addition, it is demonstrated in  <cit>  that developmental-stage- and tissue-specific cleavage and subsequent secondary capping of 3’utr is not an infrequent phenomenon. the production of such unspliced rnas may explain the 3r uest clusters that have cage tags but no promoter-like histone features.

although tins and pins have been reported to be transcribed mostly independently of their surrounding gene, only a small fraction has a sufficient concentration of cage tags for a recognizable tss. however there are more than  <dig> human tins overlapping a chromatin mark indicating a tss.

the remaining set of unspliced est clusters outside a  <dig> kb range around refseq genes comprises  <dig> % of the data. about a tenth  of these clusters overlaps retrogenes and retropseudogenes. for these cases, it is often impossible to distinguish between truly expressed loci and mapping artifacts of ests arising from the spliced original of the gene. the manual inspection of a random sample of the remaining cases shows that a large fraction of these est clusters constitute even larger extensions of 3’utrs. in many cases they also appear to be long 3’utrs or uarnas belonging to previously unannotated, typically non-coding, spliced transcripts.

to date little is known about the evolutionary age of long ncrnas. in our study only 15– <dig> % of the unspliced est cluster are conserved between human and mouse. this fraction is lower than the numbers reported for spliced lncrnas . it nevertheless indicates a substantial level of conservation that is corroborated by elevated levels of sequence conservation in most subclasses of uest clusters. ignoring technical limitations preventing us from detecting a larger number, this pattern of conservation suggests a species or lineage-specific function of the remaining transcripts. the  <dig> pairs of conserved unspliced est clusters with the same classification in human and mouse are likely to be functionally important and we expect them be present also in other mammalian species.

in summary, the analysis of unspliced ests uncovers a largely unexplored realm of long transcripts. including many previously unknown transcripts. the frequently postulated connection between lack of splicing and nuclear retention, see e.g.  <cit>  suggests that this class of transcripts might be involved in chromatin organization and possibly other mechanisms of epigenetic control. further experimental investigation of the long transcripts could provide great insight into these mechanisms.
