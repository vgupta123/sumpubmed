BACKGROUND
anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate reduction  is a major process determining deep-sea geochemistry and cold-seep ecosystems. first of all, it controls the atmospheric methane efflux from the ocean floor, consuming more than 90% of the methane produced in marine sediments  <cit> . moreover, it fuels the deep sea ecosystem by channelling thermal generated and biogenetic methane into organic matter and carbonate. finally, sr-aom shapes the sea floor landscape by contributing to bicarbonate and alkalinity production, resulting in massive carbonate precipitation  <cit> . the overall sr-aom reaction is:

two groups of microorganisms are the key players in sr-aom process: anaerobic methanotrophic archaea  with three groups  and sulphate reducing bacteria   <cit> . all anme groups discovered so far are related clades of methanogens, while their srb partner was always found in the same environment with or without forming spatial closely related consortia  <cit> . however, neither anme nor srb from sr-aom active spots has been obtained in pure culture yet. the main difficulty lies on the extremely long doubling time  and low growth yield  of anme and srb from in vitro incubations  <cit> .

to stimulate the in vitro sr-aom activity and to enrich the sr-aom community, different types of bioreactors, which can be operated at ambient/high pressure in continuous/batch mode, have been developed by different research groups  <cit> . due to the extremely low affinity for methane  and the low methane solubility at ambient pressure, high-pressure bioreactors have the advantage of permitting a higher sr-aom activity  <cit> . nevertheless, it is still unknown if the high-pressure bioreactor also confers advantage on biomass enrichment, and if it has an effect on selective enrichment of certain groups of anme. moreover, the information is lacking on the community architecture inside the high-pressure bioreactor, meaning if the microbes live as single cells or form consortia.

through high-pressure incubation, we have obtained an enrichment originating from a mud volcano from the gulf of cadiz, performing anaerobic oxidation of methane. the sr-aom activities at different incubation conditions have been described previously  <cit> . in this study, the community structure and architecture of this enrichment were investigated. the potential growth of anme and srb under high pressure has been evaluated.

RESULTS
community architectural distribution
to access the community architectural distribution, a dapi  staining was applied on the samples s <dig>  and s <dig> . based on dapi staining cell counts, both single cells and aggregates were commonly observed in s <dig> and s <dig>  the aggregates had different sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm in diameter . in both s <dig> and s <dig> single cells were 1- <dig> orders more abundant than the aggregates . among all the aggregates, the ones with diameter from  <dig> to  <dig> μm were the most abundant ones . few spherical aggregates bigger than  <dig> μm were observed in s <dig> or s <dig> . for some aggregates we observed that it was dividing into two smaller spherical aggregates in both s <dig> and s <dig> . this was also reported in another enrichment from a semi-continuous bioreactor operated under  <dig>  mpa methane pressure  <cit> . it is an indication that these large aggregates may have reached a "critical size" during growth, which then may disintegrate into smaller aggregates for further growth.

cell aggregates accounted for the major part of the biovolume . the middle size aggregates  contributed for about half of the total biovolume . although the big size aggregates  had very low concentrations , they also contributed for large part of the biovolume .

enrichment of total biomass
the total biovolume concentration increased from * <dig> μm3/ml slurry in s <dig> to * <dig> μm3/ml slurry in s <dig> . since the reactor volume was fixed and the biomass washing out during reactor operation was negligible  <cit> , the total biomass inside the reactor increased  <dig>  times within  <dig> days. this reactor system was the first system that was able to accumulate total biomass while maintaining high sr-aom activity-- <dig>  mmol sulfide production per day while the reactor was operated at batch mode under  <dig> mpa methane pressure  <cit> . in the systems previously reported by other authors, either only specific groups but not the total biomass was quantified  <cit>  or there was major loss of biomass due to sampling and decay  <cit> .

the biovolume data was converted into cell dry weight for a comparison with vss  data. taken the same assumption as described by nauhaus et al.  <cit> , there was about  <dig>  g cell dry weight/ml biovolume in the sediment sample with sr-aom activity. therefore the biomass concentration in the high-pressure bioreactor increased from  <dig>   in s <dig> to  <dig>   in s <dig>  however, this value was one order lower compared to the  <dig> g/l of vss  as reported by zhang et al.  <cit> . one possibility is that the assumption  <dig>  g cell dry weight/ml biovolume was based on analysis of two strains of small marine microorganism  <cit> , which could be not representative of the cells enriched in the reactor. another possibility would be the extracellular polymeric substances  contributed large part of vss. for example, for granular microbial aggregates enriched in an oland  reactor, as much as 50-80% of the space occupied by bacteria was constituted of eps  <cit> . for the deep-sea sediment, the presence of eps has been reported both from in situ sediment and in vitro enrichments at different locations  <cit> . however whether the production of eps was stimulated during high-pressure incubations and what was the mechanism behind still needs to be further investigated.

community structure
to identify the cells and aggregates observed under microscope, catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization  with probes on anme- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and srb  was applied on s <dig> and s <dig>  based on card-fish counts, anme- <dig> and srb were the most abundant ones compared to other types of anme, especially in the form of aggregates. among the free-living cells, only less than 10% belonged to anme- <dig> or srb . the number of anme- <dig> aggregates accounted for  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the total aggregates in s <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in s <dig>  while srb accounted for  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the total aggregates in s <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in s <dig>  however, it has to be taken into account that the card-fish in this study was performed with single probe hybridization. aggregates with anme- <dig> are most probably also containing srb as well, because they tend to live closely and form consortia  <cit> . no anme- <dig> was detected in s <dig> and s <dig>  about 2% of anme- <dig> was detected in the aggregates .

 <dig> the average value and standard error were calculated based on  <dig> fields of view on each hybridization. no anme- <dig> cell or aggregate was observed based on our method.  <dig> detection limit of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml slurry.  <dig> detection limit of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml slurry

the card-fish result showed that a large part of biomass in s <dig> and s <dig>  especially single cells, did not belong to anme or srb. there was growth of other unknown microbes within a mixed community of anme/srb. therefore a clone library analysis was performed on s <dig> to approach to the complete archaeal and bacterial communities. archaeal community had extremely low diversity, where anme-2a and mbg-d  were the only two groups of archaea detected. anme-2a was the dominant, which accounted for 88% of the archaeal community . no 16s rrna gene from anme- <dig> was detected. the absence of anme- <dig> in the archaeal clone library was contradictory to card-fish result. the size of the clone library was not large enough to detect the rare anme- <dig> or the hybridization experiment may have led to mis-hybridization, thus giving false positive signal. dissimilar from archaeal community, the bacterial community was highly diverse . gammaproteobacteria  were the most dominant followed by the deltaproteobacteria , which includes the srb. among total bacteria population in s <dig>  8% was belonging to seep-srb1a subgroup of deltaproteobacteria, which were found to be specifically associated with anme-2a in other enrichments mediating sr-aom process  <cit> . most of the gammaproteobacteria found in the community were closely related to methylophaga sp. and methylobacter sp., which are known to use reduced one-carbon compounds, such as methane, methanol or dimethylsulphide  <cit> . the presence of such bacteria in our anaerobic reactor is intriguing since methane and sulphate were the only electron donor and acceptor supplied. the presence and even production of sulphide  was an indication of anaerobic condition inside the reactor. however we cannot exclude the possibility of a limited amount of dissolved oxygen in the reactor influent, which could explain the presence of aerobic. further tests need to show if these gammaproteobacteria are playing an important active role in the reactor.

enrichment of anme- <dig> and srb
card-fish results showed that percentages of anme- <dig> and srb biovolume increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in s <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in s <dig> . by combining with the total biovolume data from dapi staining , the biovolume of anme- <dig> in s <dig> was:

 *  <dig> % =  <dig> * <dig> μm3/ml slurry

the biovolume of anme- <dig> in s <dig> was:

 *  <dig> % =  <dig> * <dig> μm3/ml slurry

therefore after  <dig> days incubation, the anme- <dig> population increased for  <dig>  times. following the same method of calculation, the srb population increased for  <dig>  times after  <dig> days incubation in this high-pressure bioreactor. the populations of anme- <dig> and srb both increased faster than the total biomass, which indicated that anme- <dig> and srb were selectively enriched in the system. this selective enrichment of anme- <dig> and srb was another proof that the incubation condition inside this high-pressure bioreactor was favourable for sr-aom community.

to our knowledge, this is the first report on the enrichment of sr-aom community under high methane pressure, although potential growth of anme- <dig>  anme- <dig> and srb has been reported in other engineered systems at ambient or low methane pressures . the different inocula showed different doubling times. when anme- <dig> and anme-2c were incubated in continuous flow bioreactors under ambient methane partial pressure, anme- <dig> had doubling time of  <dig>  months while anme-2c had doubling time of  <dig>  months  <cit> . high methane partial pressure appeared to have advantage on stimulating the growth of anme. in the experiment of krüger et al.  <cit> , the methane-dependent uptake of 15n-nh <dig> by aom community dominated by anme- <dig> was higher at  <dig>  mpa methane pressure than at ambient methane pressure. if we assume the anme-2a cells in our system were following a logarithmic growth curve, a doubling time of  <dig>  months can be estimated based on anme- <dig> biovolume in s <dig> and s <dig>  which is shorter than the result  obtained by meulepas et al.  <cit> . the increase of energy gained from sr-aom process by increasing methane pressure may favour the biomass growth  <cit> . continuous flow also stimulated growth: anme-2a/2c had longer doubling time in a fed-batch bioreactor  than in continuous flow bioreactors  .

CONCLUSIONS
after  <dig> days incubation in a simulated cold seep environment under high methane pressure, anme- <dig> and srb in the sediment from captain arutyunov mud volcano were enriched. based on biovolume calculation, the populations of anme- <dig> and srb increased for  <dig>  times and  <dig>  times. within total biomass volume,  <dig> % was accounted from aggregates. therefore the incubation condition apparently favoured the cells to form aggregates, especially in small size , rather than to live as single cells. no aggregate bigger than  <dig> μm in diameter was observed; they apparently divided after reaching a critical size. based on the 16s rrna gene clone library, the archaeal diversity was low, and contained only anme- <dig>  and mbg-d . in contrast, the bacterial community was highly diverse.
