BACKGROUND
gene duplication via single gene, larger-scale fragment or whole genome duplication is known as a major evolutionary force for creating new genes  <cit> . while the “parental” copy conserves its original function, duplicated genes may undergo functional diversification by evolving new functions and therefore offer the organisms the ability to adapt to new environmental conditions  <cit> . duplicated genes are hierarchically gathered in gene families in the genome whose expansion will depend on the number of duplication rounds and the force of selection pressures acting on duplicates resulting in their retention or loss  <cit> . unconstrained duplicates may accumulate degenerative mutations and will be therefore eliminated from the genome by purifying selection  <cit> .

uncoupling proteins  are evolutionary conserved proteins involved in the coupling mechanism of the electron transport chain to atp synthesis which is driven by a proton gradient over the mitochondrial inner membrane. the energy harvested from electrons generates a proton gradient that is used to produce atp or, by influence of ucps, may be dissipated as heat  <cit> . heat production by mammalian ucp <dig> is crucial for non-shivering thermogenesis and cold-survival of rodents, hibernators and human infants  <cit>  while the physiological role of the ucp <dig> orthologue in ectotherms is unclear.

several ucp <dig> homologues including ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> have been identified from various tissues in vertebrates. ucp <dig> with a ubiquitous expression pattern has been implicated in multiple functions including the regulation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> , growth control  <cit> , lipid metabolism  <cit>  and regulation of insulin secretion  <cit> . ucp <dig>  adjacent to ucp <dig> in genomes and mainly expressed in the skeletal muscle, is related to oxidative and metabolic processes  <cit> .

in fishes, three members of the ucp gene family  have been unequivocally identified in many species including zebrafish , the puffer fish , the rainbow trout  and the gilthead sea bream   <cit> . recent studies have indicated that zebrafish genome contains more than three ucps. hughes and criscuolo  <cit>  reported the presence of a fourth gene encoding a ucp protein . the same authors further showed that the fourth zebrafish is flanked by the same genes like other vertebrate ucp <dig>  which implies that this latter might be an isoform of ucp <dig> that resulted from alternative splicing or wrong annotation. interestingly, the sequence of the fourth zebrafish ucp  corresponds exactly to one of the two isoforms predicted as ucp <dig> in ensembl genome browser, which has been previously identified as ucp <dig> orthologue in fish by jastroch et al.  <cit> . more recently, tseng et al.  <cit>  indicated the presence of a fourth ucp  and a fifth ucp gene  in zebrafish. while their phylogenetic analyses showed that zebrafish ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> are grouped in the same clades than their mammal counterparts, the authors found that these two carriers are distantly related to ucp1-ucp <dig> and the syntenies around are not conserved across mammals, birds, amphibians and fishes, even within teleost lineage. this indicates that names given in the literature to these genes as members of ucp family could be misleading. hence, the exact number of uncoupling protein genes in fish genome and the evolutionary history of this protein family remain controversial and should be elucidated. the current availability of five sequenced teleost genomes offers the opportunity of performing a range of comparative and evolutionary analyses that would enable to clarify that question.

the accurate identification of unambiguous orthologue genes across species is a critical step for comparative studies aimed at inferring the molecular function of protein sequences and finding genes that are functionally related  <cit> . the traditional approaches used to establish orthology relationships of gene families are mainly based on constructing multiple alignments of sequences identified by reciprocal best blast hits between multiple genomes, which are then used to infer phylogenetic relationships via maximum likelihood or parsimony methods  <cit> . although this revolutionary approach enables an accurate orthology assignment between genes, its reliability can be limited when dealing with complex genomes and large gene families, particularly in vertebrate where many genes are partial or imperfectly annotated due the complexity of gene organisation . moreover, the blast hit searches often return the closest hits which may not have been evolved from a common ancestral gene  <cit> . a common complementation of this procedure is using synteny-based methods which exploit synteny information to resolve ambiguous orthology assignment between genes in different species  <cit> . it is worth noting that this approach has some limitations, especially related to large-scale genomic rearrangements and gain or loss of genes that can shuffle synteny information even between closely related species, but also to the incompleteness of many sequenced genomes that renders the detection of conserved synteny complex and difficult. although the above mentioned methods appear to be somewhat limited, they benefit from a high degree of complementarity that makes them the most reliable and accurate approaches for orthology assignment when applied in parallel.

our experimental research focuses on the european sea bass, dicentrarchus labrax, which is a major marine aquaculture species in the european union. sea bass ucps may provide potential targets to impact metabolism and growth, as studies of mammalian ucps suggest major roles in energy balance and oxidative stress. to our knowledge, there has not been any report on the molecular characterisation of uncoupling protein genes in the sea bass. in this study, we have characterised four members of the uncoupling protein gene family in sea bass. the genomic structure of these four sea bass ucps have been determined and their orthologues in the available teleost fish genomes have been identified by similarity and conserved synteny searches. furthermore, we took advantage to the current availability of a large amount of sequence information in many species to re-annotate and retrace the evolution of ucps in vertebrates. our results revealed for the first time a fish-specific duplication of uncoupling protein genes.

RESULTS
annotation and nomenclature of sea bass ucps
the blast search of stickleback ucp <dig> against sea bass genome shotgun and bacend sequences allows the identification of three scaffolds putatively containing a ucp gene, which are respectively assigned to sea bass chromosomes lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  the ucp genes as well as their flanking genes were predicted using a combination of ab initio and homology-based predictions. ucp <dig> was predicted on chromosome lg <dig> and is flanked upstream by elmod <dig>  and downstream by tbc1d <dig>  . ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> were predicted on chromosome lg <dig> and were found adjacent as previously demonstrated in many vertebrates including fish. they are flanked by dnajb <dig>  related, subfamily b, member 13) and ppme <dig>  . ucp3l predicted on chromosome lg <dig> is bounded upstream by camkk <dig> . downstream, ucp3l is flanked by c2cd <dig>  . the embl files of sea bass ucp and flanking genes are available in additional file  <dig> 

the analysis of gene structure revealed that coding sequences of each sea bass ucp gene covered six exons as previously demonstrated in other teleost species for ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> . for each ucp member, exon  <dig> is longer whereas exon  <dig> is shorter. the comparison between four members showed that the three last exons  are conserved in terms of length. exon  <dig> has the same size for ucp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> but it is 6 bp longer for ucp3l. by contrast, exon  <dig> is one base pair shorter for ucp3l than for ucp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which have the same size. exon  <dig>  the only exon different in terms of length between the four ucp members, is shorter for ucp <dig> and longer for ucp3l.

identification of ucp orthologues in other teleost species
we have taken a closer look in other teleost genomes available in ensembl genome browser  and found that these ucp genes are located in conserved syntenic regions . by searching in these syntenic regions, we found the orthologues of the four ucp genes characterised in sea bass apart from ucp3l, which was not found in zebrafish. the protein sequence corresponding to ucp3l was not found for zebrafish neither in ensembl genome browser database nor in genbank. however, we did find the flanking genes  of this fourth ucp on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  in order to determine whether the absence of ucp3l in zebrafish genome is due to an independent loss or a missannotation, we extracted the region harbouring camkk <dig> and c2cd <dig> loci and re-annotated it using genscan. as for the homology searches, this did not enable prediction of another ucp gene, suggesting that ucp3l has been independently lost in the zebrafish genome. the genomic location of these ucp orthologues as well as their protein ids are shown in table  <dig>  interestingly, these ucp members are flanked in each species by the same genes as their sea bass orthologues .

protein ids are given to allow access to the protein sequence on ensembl or genbank website.

sequence identity between sea bass and stickleback ucps
amino acid sequence comparison with stickleback showed that sea bass ucp genes possess all the domain amino acid residues that serve as a signature for the ucp gene core family . protein sequence alignment revealed that sea bass ucp <dig> share more identity with stickleback ucp <dig> by comparison to other sea bass ucp members . likewise, sea bass ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> are closely related to stickleback ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  respectively compared to sea bass ucp <dig> and ucp3l. similar results were observed for ucp3l which is more identical to stickleback ucp3l. the intra-specific sequence comparison in sea bass showed that ucp <dig> is more identical to ucp <dig> whereas the latter is more related to ucp3l . among these three ucp members, ucp <dig> shares more identity with ucp <dig>  similar results were observed in stickleback with ucp3l closer to ucp <dig>  which is more related to ucp <dig> and the later more identical to ucp <dig> by comparison to ucp <dig> and ucp3l.

id: identical; sb: sea bass; st: stickleback.

identification of teleost ucp orthologues in other vertebrates
the search for ucp orthologues in vertebrates enabled their identification in a variety of species including mammalians, reptiles, birds and amphibians. the chromosomal location of ucps and the protein id in each species are shown in table  <dig>  the search for ucp <dig> ortologues in vertebrates enabled its identification in mammals . in amphibians , ucp <dig> was found. however, no ucp <dig> orthologue sequence was found in birds and reptiles and the synteny search of the region containing flanking genes in the chicken  and the anole lizard  did not allow identification of sequences similar to ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> are present in mammals  and reptiles , and are adjacent as previously demonstrated in many reports. as in teleost fishes, they are flanked upstream by the same gene  but they are bounded in their downstream part by c2cd <dig> located just before ppme <dig> . in amphibian genomes, only ucp <dig> was found and it is flanked by the same genes as reptile and mammalian ucp2/ucp <dig>  the re-annotation of the region bounded by the flanking genes by genscan did not enable prediction of another ucp gene, supporting the results of homology searches. contrary to amphibians, birds have only ucp <dig> which flanked by the same genes as amphibian ucp <dig> . our re-annotation of the region surrounded by the flanking genes did not allow the prediction of new genes. our search for teleost ucp orthologues in lamprey allows the identification of one ucp gene only, a sequence that has been characterized ucp <dig> by wang et al.  <cit> . we then searched for ucp orthologues in the lancelet which is considered as the closest living invertebrate relative to vertebrates. this allowed the identification of a ucp-like sequence accession number: abr <dig> in branchiostoma belcheri. clustalw multiple alignments revealed that the lancelet ucp-like sequence was 53%, 55% and 56% identical to sea bass ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  respectively. comparisons with all vertebrate ucp sequences revealed that the lancelet ucp-like shares more identity  with cow  ucp <dig>  however, these results are in contradiction with those from the phylogenetic analysis including the ucp-like  because the latter indicated that lancelet ucp is closer to vertebrate ucp <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic trees of ucp proteins from the predicted genes in sea bass and the other five teleosts as well as sequences of vertebrates from ensembl and genbank were constructed using maximum likelihood  method as implemented in phyml. all fish ucps fall into four clades that are respectively comprised of ucp <dig>  ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp3l . the branching patterns within these clusters matched the phylogenetic relationships among the six teleost species analysed in this study  <cit> . in negrisolo et al.  <cit>  study where zebrafish was used as an out-group, stickleback and sea bass clustered together and are closer to medaka, which is more distantly related to the tetraodontiform clade . these four clades are consistent with the results of sequences similarity between sea bass and stickleback which showed that the same ucp members from different species share more identity than different members of the same species . the phylogenetic analysis including other vertebrates  confirmed that ucp3l is newly annotated and found only in teleost fishes. the phylogenetic inference based on ucp protein sequences grouped teleost ucp <dig> in the same clade with their vertebrate orthologues . likewise, the ucp <dig> orthologues from all vertebrates including teleost are assigned to the same clade. teleost ucp <dig> are grouped in the same clade, which was separated with mammal ucp <dig> clade with a high bootstrap support. this phylogenetic pattern was confirmed by the tree inferred from nucleotide sequences .

selection pressures
the ratios of nonsynonymous  to synonymous  substitution  were calculated for each teleost ucp cluster. all pairwise comparisons of teleost orthologues are shown in additional file  <dig>  the average values of ω were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ucp <dig>  ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp3l, respectively. according to ω values estimated from the four ucp sequences, we found that ucp3l has the highest dn/ds ratio  whereas ucp <dig> has the lowest ratio . the ω value of ucp3l is about twice the magnitude of the other ucp members. all ucp genes have a dn/ds ratio <  <dig> apart from ucp3l whose two pairwise comparisons  showed dn/ds ratios >  <dig> . the global dn/ds ratio estimated using rel analysis showed similar results with higher value for ucp3l  compared to ucp <dig> , ucp <dig>  and ucp <dig> . the rel analysis found no positively selected sites for ucp <dig> and ucp3l. one site was positively selected from the rel analysis for ucp <dig>  and ucp <dig>  with a bf ≥  <dig>  but they were not confirmed as exhibiting very strong evidence for positive selection . the rel analysis indicated that all ucp <dig> sites are under strong purifying section. the number of sites identified from rel analysis as being under strong purifying selection  was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp3l, respectively.

functional divergence
θi and θii were estimated using diverge program and significant values  are labelled with *.

moreover, critical amino acid residues that might be responsible for the functional divergence of the ucp family in teleost were predicted by calculating the site-specific profile based on posterior probability analysis. a posterior probability value higher than  <dig>   >  <dig> ) was used as a cutoff to identify potential sites of type-i functional divergence in all pairwise comparisons between ucp clusters. among  <dig> sites analysed in all pairwise comparisons,  <dig> amino acid residues  >  <dig> ) were predicted as being responsible for site-specific difference  between ucp1/ucp <dig> clusters . the comparisons of ucp <dig> with ucp <dig> and ucp3l allowed the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> potential sites of type-i divergence, respectively. for the ucp2/ucp3l and ucp3/ucp3l comparisons, three potential sites that have undergone shifted rates have been identified whereas only one site is predicted to be highly functional divergence-related between ucp <dig> and ucp3l.

overall, there was no clear evidence for type-ii functional divergence but we did further investigate whether it exists any potential site for type-ii functional divergence. we applied a cutoff of qii  >  <dig> for site-specific posterior probabilities. thus, a total of  <dig> radical changes were identified between all pairwise comparisons . amongst them, the largest number and highest posterior probability values were found in the comparisons with ucp <dig> . only two potential type-ii sites were respectively detected in ucp2/ucp <dig> comparison. no radical change was found in ucp2/ucp3l and ucp3/ucp3l comparisons.

discussion
five so-called ucp homologues ucp1-ucp <dig> annotated in mammals have been reported in the zebrafish, danio rerio. while zebrafish ucp1-ucp <dig> are closely related, ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> do not group into the core ucp family  <cit> . accordingly, nedergaard and cannon  <cit>  had already suggested that these carriers  are wrongly annotated as ucp and do not belong to the uncoupling protein family. in this study, we have identified four different ucp genes closely related in the european sea bass d. labrax. our further analyses revealed these ucp genes are shared by five other fish species, providing evidence for the existence of four unambiguous ucp gene family members in teleost organisms. similarity searches revealed that teleost ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> are clearly orthologues to the corresponding ucp genes in the other vertebrates including amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals. the detailed analysis of conserved synteny of the region harbouring ucp loci confirmed the similarity results. mammal, reptile, bird and amphibian ucp <dig> were flanked with the same genes  like in teleost fishes. the upstream flanking gene of ucp2/ucp <dig> was the same  for teleosts and the other vertebrates, but their downstream flanking was different. mammal, reptile, bird and amphibian ucp2/ucp <dig> were bounded upstream by c2cd <dig> located just before ppme <dig> that flanks teleost ucp2/ucp <dig>  suggesting that c2cd <dig> has been lost in teleost fishes. the phylogenetic analyses of vertebrate ucp genes also support the similarity results, because they have enabled the unequivocal identification of the orthologues of these three teleost ucps in a variety of other vertebrate species. the maximum likelihood analysis revealed that teleost ucp <dig> was monophyletic with ucp <dig> of other vertebrates including amphibians and reptiles. this monophyletic character together with the high level of sequence identity within vertebrate ucp <dig>  suggests evolutionary conserved functions. this is in good agreement with the virtual zero of its functional branch length  that indicates this cluster may have maintained a larger component of ancestral function. likewise, teleost ucp <dig> was monophyletic with amphibian and mammalian ucp <dig> as previously reported by many authors  <cit> . the ucp <dig> clade is highly divergent from that of other ucp paralogues as evidenced by its longest branch length, which is indicative of strong selective constraints and functional shifts  <cit> . this interpretation is in good agreement with our functional analyses that indicated large site-specific differences  and higher posterior probability values  in all pairwise comparisons including ucp <dig>  the longer bf of ucp <dig> in vertebrates also suggests important functional shifts, which are more marked in teleosts. mammalian, reptile and bird ucp <dig> are monophyletic, but their monophyly with their teleost orthologues was not resolved. these observations suggest that teleost ucp <dig> are highly divergent from that of the other vertebrates, divergence that may be due to an accelerated evolutionary rate of ucp <dig> either in teleost or in other vertebrates. the functional analyses showed a longer functional branch length in the other vertebrates compared to teleost , suggesting a functional shift during the evolution of ucp <dig> 

on the other hand, sequence similarity did not enable the identification of the fourth teleost ucp gene in mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians as well as in lampreys. with the analysis of conserved synteny of the genomic region harbouring the fourth ucp, we were unsuccessful in identifying its orthologue in other vertebrates. this indicates that our fourth ucp  might be a fish-specific gene and that the specific event which gives rise to that gene has occurred in teleost lineage and did not affect the other vertebrates. interestingly, the downstream flanking gene of ucp3l was identical to that of ucp2/ucp <dig> and its upstream flanking gene  was a locus located  <dig>  mb prior on the genomic sequence fragment harbouring ucp2/ucp <dig>  based on these observations and on the phylogenetic results, we suggest that the fourth teleost ucp resulted from a fish-specific duplication. figure  <dig> indicates the evolutionary scenario that produced ucp3l in teleost fishes. the genomic fragment that harbors ucp2/ucp <dig> has been duplicated in teleost fishes. the c2cd <dig> locus was lost on the original fragment, possibly after the divergence of teleost and tetrapod ancestors, because of the presence of the latter in amphibians, reptiles and mammals. ucp <dig> as well as its flanking genes  were retained by the duplicated fragment whereas all genes between camkk <dig> and ucp <dig> including ucp <dig> were lost. the duplicated copy of ucp <dig> gene has diverged significantly from the original copy to become ucp3l whose retention suggests that it may have evolved indispensable functions in teleost organisms.

after divergence, ucp3l may have diverged in function by adopting part of the roles of the original copy or acquiring an entirely new function. functional divergence can occur after gene duplication via site-specific rate shift  or radical change in amino acid property, which is called type-ii functional divergence. in this study, ucp3/ucp3l comparison showed θi value significantly greater than zero and negative θii value, suggesting that these two genes are functionally divergent from each other and that site-specific shift changes in evolutionary rates would have been the main force for such functional divergence. this conclusion is supported by the posterior probability analysis, which did not find any radical change between ucp <dig> and ucp3l clusters. furthermore, the high dn/ds ratio of ucp3l indicates that the protein is under few selective constraints and may have therefore evolved new functions. the overall dn/ds ratio of ucp3l is about  <dig> and at least twice that of ucp <dig>  which can be due either to a relaxation of negative or purifying selection or to an action of diversifying or positive selection. the rel analysis found no positively selected sites for ucp3l among teleost orthologues and the number of negatively selected sites is much lower than that of the other ucp members including ucp <dig>  these results indicate that the higher dn/ds ratios of ucp3l are due to a relaxation of purifying selection rather than positive selection. such a relaxation of purifying selection can be attributed to a more recent origin of ucp3l, a finding which is consistent with the idea that recent duplicates tolerate more amino-acid substitutions than old duplicates  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that members of duplicated genes often evolve at different rates after duplication and that the copy  of the duplicated gene that evolve faster have higher dn/ds ratios  <cit> . the results of the functional distance analysis showed relatively long functional branch length  for ucp3l, which implies that this duplicate gene may have lost a larger component of ancestral function after duplication. however, further analyses including tissue-specific expression and studies on protein function are needed to determine whether teleost ucp <dig> and ucp3l share communalities in function.

the comparison of the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site between ucp orthologues revealed that the products of ucp1- <dig> genes are highly conserved by purifying selection. this strong purifying selection against mutations that result in replacement of amino acids suggests that these ucp genes play crucial roles in teleost fishes. the examination of site-specific selection pressures by rel analysis identified only one site under moderate positive selection  for ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> and our further analyses using more strict criteria  did not support strong evidence for positive selection at these sites. therefore, no valid conclusions could be drawn regarding the functional significance of these changes.

analyses of vertebrate ucp evolution by hughes and criscuolo  <cit>  and saito et al.  <cit>  suggest that ucp1- <dig> were acquired through two rounds of gene duplication. the first duplication produced ucp <dig> and the ancestral gene of ucp2/ucp <dig> whereas the second duplication produced ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  the results presented in this study confirm the previous conclusions that vertebrate ucp1- <dig> evolved from two successive duplications. the phylogenetic and syntenic analyses suggest that the first duplication  gave rise to ucp <dig> and ucp2/ucp <dig> ancestral gene took place prior to the divergence of vertebrates as evidenced by the presence of a homologue of ucp <dig> in early vertebrates . the second round of duplication  that resulted in ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> occurred early in vertebrate evolution probably after the divergence of lampreys. subsequent to these two duplications, ucp <dig> was lost from the avian and reptile lineages whereas ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> were lost from birds and amphibians, respectively . in addition to the two above mentioned duplications, a third round of duplication  occurred only in teleost fishes after they split from the tetrapod ancestors as evidenced by the absence of ucp3l in lampreys, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. by taking a closer look at the chromosomal distribution of ucp genes in fish genomes, we found that ucp3l and ucp2/ucp <dig> are located on paralogous chromosomes in t. nigroviridis <cit>  and o. latipes <cit> . these paralogous chromosomes arose from the whole genome duplication that occurred in ray-finned fish lineage around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . based on these observations, we speculate that ucp3l was generated in the ray-finned fish lineage as a result of a single event  and not because of independent gene duplications.

the absence of ucp3l in zebrafish genome could thus be attributed either to the incompleteness of the genome assembly or to an independent loss of ucp3l in this species. to determine which of these phenomenon might be responsible for the ucp3l loss in zebrafish genome, we searched whether its flanking genes  are located on one or different contigs. we found that camkk <dig> and c2cd <dig> loci are located on contig cr <dig> , whose mapping to the sea bass genome assembly revealed higher synteny with chromosome  <dig> where ucp3l is located. moreover, the re-annotation of the region harbouring camkk <dig> and c2cd <dig> loci did not reveal the presence of a ucp gene. taken together, these observations suggest that ucp3l has been independently lost in zebrafish genome. speculating about the reasons why ucp3l was lost only in zebrafish but not in the other teleost species is difficult without knowing the functional role of this gene in teleost fishes.

CONCLUSIONS
by combining phylogenetic and detailed syntenic analyses, we unequivocally identified four ucp gene family members in teleost genomes, of which three  are shared by major vertebrate lineages. phylogenetic results revealed that the gene duplication events that gave rise to these three genes occurred in the common ancestor of vertebrates, probably prior the divergence of lampreys. the fourth ucp  that has been identified only in fish, derived from teleost-specific third-round whole genome duplication that occurred in a common ancestor of teleost fishes. functional divergence analysis among ucp family members indicated that substantial altered functional constraints have occurred on all ucp paralogues after gene duplication, which may have led to the evolution of new functions. these results suggest that ucp genes might be crucial for the adaptation of teleost to diverse ecological niches. the critical amino acid residues for functional divergence identified here provide new insights into the functional evolution and diversification of ucp genes, and since knowledge on ucp function is limited especially in fishes, they offer a starting point for further experimental validations.
