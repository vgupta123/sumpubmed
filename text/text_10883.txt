BACKGROUND
fish skeletal muscles are the most abundant tissue in the body mass and play an important role in the process of certain physiological metabolism  <cit> . similar to other peripheral tissues of the body, skeletal muscles have circadian rhythms  <cit> . these rhythms are regulated by a transcriptional-translational and post-translational feedback network termed as the molecular clock  <cit> . there are several major components in the molecular clock, including circadian locomotor output cycles kaput , aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein  <dig> , cryptochrome , and period protein  etc.  <cit> . two transcriptional activation proteins of the molecular clock, namely clock and arntl <dig>  are the basic-helix-loop-helix  transcription factors that form into a heterodimer in the nucleus. together, they transactivate per and cry gene expression via binding to the e-box elements  at their promoter sequences . per and cry then translocate into the cell nucleus, in which they inactivate clock and arntl activity, thereby repressing their own transcription. the clock mechanism plays a pivotal role in myogenesis, gene transcription, and maintenance of muscle metabolism  <cit> . the molecular clock components have been identified in skeletal muscles and showed a circadian rhythms of expression. in addition to these clock genes, more than  <dig> other genes have circadian pattern of expression in skeletal muscles. these muscle genes with circadian pattern of expression are believed to be regulated by the major molecular clock genes and the clock-controlled transcription factors  <cit> .

fish are excellent model species for investigating the regulation of skeletal muscle physiology in vertebrates because it has several structural features making convenient to experimental analysis  <cit> . the slow-contracting red and fast-contracting white muscles are the two main muscle fiber types in fish  <cit> . particularly, they are localized into physically distinct area of the fish body. the fast muscle fibers are the main component of skeletal muscles that distribute along the spine of the whole body. their explosive force is strong for fast swimming using energy from glycolysis  <cit> . slow fibers, on the other hand, contain high contents of mitochondria and their metabolism is completely aerobic  <cit> . these unique features enable slow fibers to maintain sustained swimming and support oxygen respiration  <cit> .

recently, several studies have been reported on the clock rhythmicity in fish. in zebrafish, the major clock genes showed similar circadian expression patterns in fast muscles compared with the central organs, such as retina and brain  <cit> . it has been shown that insulin-like growth factor binding proteins  and myogenic regulatory factor  <dig> were controlled by the core clock genes in zebrafish skeletal muscles  <cit> . in atlantic cod fast muscles, similar circadian clock system has been identified  <cit> . another myogenic regulatory factor myf <dig> exhibited a significant correlation with the core clock genes at the transcription levels  <cit> . however there is little information on the circadian clock system components in fish slow muscle. the chinese perch  is one of the most important species in aquaculture in china  <cit> . its high nutritional value, high protein content and appealing taste have led to its expanded large-scale aquaculture in china  <cit> . in the present study, we report the characterization of circadian clock system in both fast and slow muscles of chinese perch, and the correlation analysis between core clock gene expression and  <dig> myogenic related genes in the two types of muscles.

discussion
in the present study, we identified for the first time  <dig> clock genes, including four transcriptional activation factors , eight transcriptional repressors , and three orphan nuclear receptors  in chinese perch skeletal muscles. as expected, some of the clock genes exhibited a robust oscillation during the light–dark cycle in the slow or fast skeletal muscle.

the full length cdna sequences of several key clock genes, such as clock, cry <dig>  per <dig> and nr1d <dig>  were cloned from chinese perch. silico structural analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that clock and per <dig> proteins contain the conserved pas and bhlh domains  <cit> . these two domains are required for the circadian clock functions and are highly conserved in different species during evolution  <cit> . the transcriptional repressor cry <dig> has a typical dna-photolyase and flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding domains that are present in all cryptochrome genes  <cit> . together with photolyase dna repair enzymes, fad-binding domain containing proteins form the cryptochrome/photolyase complex. this active complex has been used in blue light-induced gene expression to affect biological rhythm  <cit> . in nr1d <dig> protein, two core nuclear domains were also identified from its deduced amino acid sequence. the nr1d <dig> binds to arntl <dig> and clock via a unique zinc finger structure domain to form a complex, which binds and blocks the protein complex formation by circadian locomotor cycles  <cit> .

the daily rhythmicity was observed in many clock genes in fast muscles of several species, indicating a potential regulatory function in muscle physiology and metabolism . however, the circadian clock gene expression in slow muscles has not been reported. in the study, we analyzed the arntl <dig> and arntl <dig> gene expression in chinese perch and showed that they exhibited a light-biased expression in fast muscles. several earlier reports in rainbow trout and mouse suggested that the photosensitivity profile in fast muscles is regulated by their homologous expression in either central or peripheral clocks . however, their dark-biased expression in chinese perch slow muscle is similar to that observed in atlantic cod and zebrafish fast muscles. the correlation between arntl1/ <dig> and clock/npas <dig> in chinese perch slow muscles indicated that the mechanism underlying the transcriptional activation of the clock system may be similar to those reported from other fish species in slow muscles. npas <dig> which shares a high sequence homology with clock protein is able to substitute for clock function in the master brain clock and regulates the circadian rhythmicity in the brain. the antiphase profile between arntl and clock in chinese perch fast muscles suggested that arntl may correlate with other bhlh-pas factors in fish muscles.

among the  <dig> period genes expressed in chinese perch slow muscles, their dark-biased expression was in agreement with that reported from other fish species, such as goldfish, european sea bass and zebrafish  <cit> . on the other hand, their light-biased expression in chinese perch fast muscle is also consistent with the central and peripheral clocks in senegalese sole  <cit> . the three period genes with the daily rhythmic expression also displayed a positive correlation with the cry <dig> gene, the only cryptochrome gene with the daily rhythmicity in chinese perch fast muscle. of the period and cry genes with the daily rhythmic expression in chinese perch slow muscles, per1/ <dig> showed the positive correlation with both cry <dig> and cry <dig>  these results suggested that per may interact with cry to control the transcriptional activation and function in the circadian feedback loop.


nr1d <dig>  nr1d <dig> and rorα are members of nuclear receptor family, which are involved in stabilizing the circadian clock loop . nr1d <dig> and nr1d <dig> were identified as the constitutive transcriptional repressors of arntl <dig>  whereas rorα is the arntl <dig> transcriptional activator  <cit> . in addition, nr1d <dig> was considered to be interwoven into the core clock mechanism via downregulating the clock expression. as reported in mammals, npas <dig> expression was repressed by these nuclear receptors  <cit> . in this study, the three nuclear receptors displayed a daily rhythmic expression in chinese perch fast muscles and nr1d <dig> exhibited a negative correlation with the expression of rorα gene. this is reflected in their tight regulation with the circadian mechanism. nr1d <dig> also showed a negative correlation with clock and npas <dig>  therefore, it is possible that nrld <dig> may function by repressing npas <dig> and clock expression in fast muscles. however, nr1d <dig> had no daily rhythmic expression in chinese perch slow muscles and nr1d <dig> showed a direct relationship with the rorα expression. it could suggest that chinese perch slow muscles may have a different circadian mechanism in maintaining the stabilization loop.

in this study, the transcription levels of eleven genes related to myogenesis during the daily cycle were investigated. the data revealed that seven genes had a daily rhythmic expression in fast muscles and five in slow muscles. myogenic regulatory factors , belong to the same class of helix-loop-helix transcription factors that play distinct and overlapping roles in regulating muscle development and growth  <cit> . it has been reported that the circadian regulation of myod expression by lock/arntl was crucial for the skeletal muscle phenotype and function in mouse  <cit> . our study confirmed that myod in chinese perch fast muscles exhibited a typical daily rhythmicity. based on our observation, it is possible that the circadian regulation of chinese perch myod may function in a similar way as reported in mouse. in contrast, we have not obtained any direct evidence for circadian expression of myod in chinese perch slow muscles. therefore, it is possible that the differentially expressed mrfs may result from the lineage-specific differences by clock genes. however, our work demonstrated that one of the mrfs, mrf <dig>  in chinese perch slow muscles exhibited a rhythmic expression pattern similar to that described for myod in fast muscles, suggesting that mrf <dig> may have a potential function in the maintenance of muscle phenotype and function.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we assayed the possible correlation of a functional clock system in chinese perch slow and fast skeletal muscles. we demonstrated that  <dig> clock genes and  <dig> genes related to myogenesis exhibited the daily rhythmicity in fast muscles of chinese perch. the  <dig> clock genes and  <dig> genes related to myogenesis have the daily rhythmicity in slow muscles . the circadian expression of mrf <dig>  myf <dig>  mstn, and pcna may either positively or negatively regulate the transcription of the clock genes in both types of muscles. it is plausible that muscle type-specific maintenance and function is regulated by the core clock genes. this is based on the evidence of daily rhythmicity and apparent correlation of gene expression of clock genes and genes related to myogenesis. taken together, our data provide new information on the rhythmic expression of clock genes and a better understanding of the circadian clocks in fish muscle phenotype maintaining and function.fig.  <dig> molecular components of the clock system identified in fast and slow skeletal muscles of chinese perch and myogenic genes with daily rhythmic expression. the green and red oval represent genes involved in the peripheral clock components in chinese perch skeletal muscles, which is related with the muscle fiber. they comprise members of the transcriptional activator arm , transcriptional repressor arm  and nuclei . the daily rhythmicity of mbnl <dig>  mrf <dig>  mstn, myf <dig>  myod, myog and pcna play a crucial role in fast muscle specification, and foxk <dig>  mrf <dig>  mstn, myf <dig> and pcna play an important role in terminal slow muscle differentiation
