BACKGROUND
laos is the only landlocked country of mainland southeast asia. under siamese control since the 18th century, laos became part of french indochina in  <dig> and gained full independence in  <dig>  the country was severely affected by the vietnam war. in  <dig>  the lao people's democratic republic was established. it has a population of almost seven million  <cit> . southeast asia is an area of close contact between several major ethno-linguistic groups: the daic , the austro-asiatic , the sino-tibetan , the hmong-mien , the austronesian and the altaic. migration and assimilation processes formed the genetic landscape of culturally separated ethnic groups living in the same geographic area  <cit> . laos has an unusually high degree of human diversity  <cit> : more than  <dig> ethno-linguistic groups have been identified  <cit> . the population pattern is the result of vast movements in the last  <dig> years, mainly from china to the southern lowlands. the highlands in the north and along the annamite cordillera are inhabited by minorities  <cit> . laotian tribes have formerly been classified into three categories based on the ethno-linguistic family, the customary habitat and the type of agricultural production: lao lum  of the tai-kadai, lao thoeng/teung/kang  of the mon khmer and lao sung/song  of the sino-tibetan and the hmong-mien. this classification ceased in  <dig> due to promotion of unity of the nation and changes in habitat and agriculture  <cit> . the number of officially listed tribes varies:  <dig> prior to  <dig>   <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig>  an ethno-linguistic system of  <dig> groups was established  <cit> . in addition, the classification based on language and culture has some difficulties  <cit> . genetic data from laos are scarce. the great ethnic diversity specifies the requirements for a population sample. for forensic, population and phylogenetic purposes, it needs to cover the lineages that occur as comprehensive as possible. this is warranted by country-wide sampling. we examine the mtdna composition of laos for the first time, presenting a cross-sectional population sample of  <dig> individuals from throughout the country that was analyzed according to the highest forensic standards.

methods
mtdna samples and dna extraction
 <dig> blood samples were acquired from volunteers of both sexes from the lao people's democratic republic. total dna was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using automated standard protocols  <cit> . all donors gave their informed consent. samples were fully anonymized. ethical approval was obtained from the lao people's democratic republic's national ethics committee for health research . the donors' provinces of birth comprise  <dig> of the  <dig> provinces of laos. figure  <dig> shows the number of samples from each province. for a detailed list of donor provenience, see additional file  <dig>  no ethnic or linguistic affiliations are available. the dataset will support all genetic investigations regarding the total mtdna variation found in laos.

mtdna sequence analysis and haplogroup assignment
we generated full mtdna control region  sequence data of  <dig> samples by chain termination sequencing. all experiments were performed according to the empop forensic standard procedures to ensure highest sequence quality and reliable base calling  <cit> . contiguous cr sequences were assembled, phylogenetically aligned  <cit>  and reported with respect to the revised cambridge reference sequence  <cit>  using sequencher v <dig>  .

we performed partial coding region  sequencing in order to refine the phylogeny of samples that could not be assigned to a haplogroup more specific than paragroups m*, n* or c*. for samples of paragroup m*, we examined up to four segments  comprising snps diagnostic for m haplogroups, haplogroups d, g, and subhaplogroups. samples of paragroup c* were inspected for their haplogroup c <dig> and c <dig> status by sequencing nps 5820- <dig>  this fragment was also used to test for b <dig> subhaplogroups and d5b <dig>  where relevant. to detect haplogroups of paragroup n*, we analyzed nps 4450- <dig> and nps 6340- <dig>  primer sequences and experimental conditions were applied as published before  <cit> . to scrutinize samples for haplogroups c1c, g3b, l3b or m <dig>  cr sequencing primer reads were extended upstream to np  <dig> 

in order to endorse a reference haplogroup nomenclature, we used the comprehensive mtdna "phylotree", release  <dig>  <cit> , for assigning haplotypes to haplogroups according to their snp pattern.

post sequencing data inspection
a posteriori data quality control was performed using the network software provided on the empop website   <cit> . this program facilitates the inspection of rare or unobserved substitutions and indels occurring in the dataset that could represent possible sequence errors  <cit> . the resulting hvs-i and hvs-ii networks are shown in additional file  <dig> and explained in additional file  <dig> 

identical haplotypes  were inspected for maternal relatedness by typing up to  <dig> autosomal str loci using the ampfℓstr sgm plus pcr amplification kit  and the powerplex  <dig> system . five samples were thereafter removed from the dataset, applying a cutoff likelihood ratio of  <dig>  <cit> . one sample was excluded due to contamination.

population genetic analyses
in order to shed light on the genetic structure and population genetic history of laos and southeast asia, the laos sample was compared to surrounding populations. both countrywide and ethnic subpopulation samples from recent literature were compiled  <cit> . all sequences were aligned and trimmed to a greatest common range, cytosine insertions after nps  <dig> and  <dig> were disregarded. we conducted two separate analyses, one comprising a total of  <dig> samples from this study, northern thailand  <cit> , vietnam  <cit> , hong kong  <cit>  and a mixed han sample  <cit>  with a greatest common range of nps 16024- <dig> and 30- <dig> , another comprising laos and  <dig> east asian populations with a total of  <dig> samples  .

total n =  <dig>  nps 16024- <dig> 30-407

total n =  <dig>  nps 16024-16383

the random match probability for each population was calculated as sum of squared haplotype frequencies . we performed intra- and interpopulation comparisons: the number of mean pairwise differences within and between populations, molecular diversity indices, and an analysis of molecular variance  were calculated using arlequin   <cit> . also the corrected numbers of mpd between populations were determined, i.e. the mpd between two populations minus the mean number of mpd contained within these two populations. to give additional perspective on the genetic relation of the populations and for a visualization of the amova results, we performed a correspondence analysis based on pairwise fst values using pasw statistics  <dig> .

RESULTS
haplogroup composition, unique and most common haplotypes of the laos sample
the  <dig> laotian samples classified into  <dig> distinct haplogroups  <cit> . 45% of the samples were assigned to a terminal twig of the "phylotree".  <dig> cr haplotypes, of which  <dig> were unique  were detected . the most prevalent haplogroups were b5a , f1a1a , c <dig> and m7b <dig> . the most frequent cr haplotypes  were a b5a  and a f1a <dig> haplotype .

macrohaplogroup n  comprised 57% of the samples in  <dig> haplogroups. 26% of the samples were assigned to haplogroup b, almost equally to b <dig> and b <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig> haplogroup b <dig> samples were found to be haplogroup b5a. 22% of the samples belonged to haplogroup f, of which 79% belonged to f1a and its subhaplogroups. macrohaplogroup m  comprised 43% in  <dig> haplogroups. 32% of the samples belonged to haplogroup m, distributed among ten subhaplogroups. 25% of the m samples, however, remained m*. no maternal west eurasian or african admixture was detected.

haplogroups according to  <cit> , release  <dig>  frequencies are rounded to one decimal place.

diversity indices of the laos sample
the power of discrimination by cr was calculated  <dig> %, the random match probability  <dig> %. the number of mean pairwise differences for full cr was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this high number is due to the double origin of east asian mtdna lineages in both macrohaplogroup m and n.

point heteroplasmic positions in the laos sample
point heteroplasmies at a single cr position were observed in eight samples. two of these  were the most common point heteroplasmic positions observed in a dataset of  <dig> global samples  <cit> . one position  was found three times, two positions a single time , three heteroplasmic positions  were absent in the  <dig> samples. a search in the  <dig> sequences  of the empop database  yielded three hits for 16086y, the latter two positions remained unobserved. the proportion of cr profiles revealing a heteroplasmic position was  <dig> %, in agreement with observations in blood samples from other populations   <cit> .

new insights into the southeast asian mtdna phylogeny
after cr sequencing, a number of laos samples displayed new snp motifs within haplogroups b and d that were found recurrent in other central, east and southeast asian populations   <cit> . these findings  indicate that the phylogeny of the particular lineages is not yet fully resolved.

haplogroups according to  <cit> , release  <dig> 

the partial codr sequencing had a great impact on the phylogenetic resolution of the dataset. it helped to confirm and exclude haplogroups without or with recurrent cr motifs. in addition, new codr snp patterns were detected. the assays applied therefore constitute valuable time-, cost- and dna-saving alternatives to whole mitochondrial genome sequencing for phylogenetic purposes.

the paragroup m* codr sequencing assay was performed on  <dig> samples.  <dig> samples were confirmed to belong to a described m haplogroup, haplogroups d or g. new, recurrent snp motifs with matching haplotypes from thailand, vietnam, hong kong and the philippines  were revealed by all but two of the remaining m* samples. figure  <dig> shows the novel m lineages found. to remain with the established nomenclature  <cit> , we refrained from assigning new haplogroup names. for some haplotypes, codr snps that were not analyzed were inferred from the known information. this strategy is widely applied when cr is only sequenced partly  <cit> , and in genetic epidemiology .

the recently described haplogroup m <dig> was diverse in the laos sample. several new sublineages  could be identified in  <dig> individuals from laos, thailand, vietnam, china and the philippines. three haplogroup m samples from laos and thailand revealed the snp pattern 11810-12732- <dig> indicating haplogroup m <dig>  <cit> , while other presumably diagnostic snps were not present. these findings indicate that the southeast asian mtdna phylogeny is far from being resolved and needs more sequence information for full clarification .

we inspected the recurrent codr snps for their effect on amino acid level using the "mitowheel" v <dig>  http://www.mitowheel.org. interestingly, two out of the  <dig> base substitutions caused amino acid substitutions , while nine were silent mutations. snp variants persistent in the face of purifying selection are expected to be silent, adaptive or neutral   <cit> . this finding could be another indication of a true phylogenetic meaning of the new basal haplogroup m codr snp patterns that we found in multiple samples from several populations.

haplogroup composition of laos compared to surrounding populations
the laos sample showed mtdna diversity characteristic of southeast asian populations. the composition of haplogroups was in agreement with other populations from this region  <cit> , with haplogroups b4a, b5a, m7b <dig>  f1a and r <dig> being the most frequent southern aboriginal lineages. the ample haplogroup pattern may reflect the rich history of migrations of ethnic groups in today's laos. aside from a few haplogroups with high sample numbers, a plethora was present at very low frequencies. the five most prevalent haplogroups together comprised 37% of the samples .

in laos, haplogroups b4a and r <dig> were less frequent than expected from the literature. this is partly explained by "technical" reasons: samples assigned to haplogroup "r9a" by hvs-i-motifs  <cit>  actually belong to f3a . nevertheless, there was only one f3a sample in the laos dataset. earlier publications considered b4g haplotypes as b4a due to their common root  <cit> . b4g, not b4a is the most prevalent b <dig> haplogroup in laos.

little northern contribution was detected. the presence of haplogroups described as northern  asian  <cit> , i.e. a, z, y, c, m8a, m <dig>  g <dig>  d and n <dig>  was low in the laos dataset. haplogroups g, m <dig> and a were present as singletons, y and z were absent. haplogroup c, in contrast, showed an unexpectedly high frequency of 6%, but very limited diversity: all haplotypes belonged to haplogroup c <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> samples derive from northern provinces . together with the singular presence of haplogroup m <dig>  this is indicative of a founder effect - possibly the immigration of a small group of females carrying the c <dig> haplogroup from its northern pool.

genetic comparisons with four east asian populations 
we compared the genetic composition of the current sample to that of populations from thailand  <cit> , vietnam  <cit> , hong kong  <cit>  and mixed han from china and taiwan  <cit>  with the greatest common range of nps 16024- <dig> and 30- <dig>  the total number of samples was  <dig> .

the numbers of intrapopulation mpd were highly similar. the highest intrapopulation diversity was found in the mixed han sample  followed by laos ; the lowest in vietnam . the intrapopulation rmp ranged between  <dig>   and  <dig>   indicating that the populations were highly differentiated. laos was intermediate with a value of  <dig>  . interpopulation mpd ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , the corrected values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the low and similar values indicate similar genetic structures of the populations. the corrected and uncorrected results corresponded, as population pairs ranked low, medium or high in both calculations .

all populations shared haplotypes to varying extents.  <dig> haplotypes  of the laos sample were found in the other populations. thailand was at the top  followed by vietnam  and hong kong . the mixed han sample only shared 3% of its haplotypes with laos and its most frequent shared haplotype was only a singleton in the laos sample .

amova was used to test for significant variation in the mtdna genetic structure among the populations. almost all genetic variation observed is attributable to differences within populations . variance among populations only accounts for  <dig> %. the amova results were statistically significant .

the low and similar pairwise fst values possibly reflect the common origin of the populations and little evolutionary time since their differentiation. however, the small genetic variance detected was significant for almost all comparisons. no significant difference in genetic structure was found between the laos and the vietnam population sample, which may indicate extensive gene flow by migration between the two countries .

genetic comparisons with  <dig> east asian populations 
to shed more light on the genetic structure of the laos sample, we performed analogous analyses including a greater number of east asian populations  <cit>  with a shorter segment . the total number of samples was  <dig> from  <dig> populations .

the numbers of intrapopulation mpd ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the highest intrapopulation diversity was found in the pinghua han  <cit>  , the lowest in the hmong  <cit> . laos was third highest . the intrapopulation rmp ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>   indicating highly differentiated populations. laos was intermediate at  <dig>  .

the interpopulation mpd spanned from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , the corrected values from  <dig>  for several comparisons to  <dig>  . the range of values was greater than for the analyses using a longer segment , revealing a greater population differentiation. this was expected given the broader geographic origin of populations included. tibet, being a population at far geographic distance, had the highest numbers of mpd with all of the samples but the other northern sample , an effect that was only visible after correction .

the order of the populations in the mpd and rmp analyses was different when only hvs-i was analyzed , which demonstrates the impact of larger reading frames. it can be supposed that the results of analyses with more information included are closer to truth.

all populations shared haplotypes with the laos sample. 46% of the laos haplotypes were found in other populations. this high percentage is due to the short mtdna segment and the high number of populations involved. the geographically closer populations, i.e. thailand  <cit> , hong kong  <cit> , the southern indigenous minorities  <cit> , pinghua han  <cit> , guangdong han  <cit> , vietnam  <cit> , hmong and mien  <cit>  and the austro-asiatic  <cit>  tended to share higher proportions  than the southern tibeto-burmans and tibet  <cit> , daic  <cit> , the mixed han samples  <cit>  and the sample from island southeast asia  <cit>   .

amova again showed that the observed genetic variation was mainly attributable to differences within populations . variance among populations accounted for  <dig> % . the amova results were statistically significant.

mainly low, but also some intermediate fst values resulted from the pairwise comparisons, indicating limited genetic differentiation between the populations . all intermediate fst values were yielded in comparisons including the tibet  <cit>  or the northern han  <cit>  sample, and comparisons with these two population samples resulted in the highest pairwise fst values for most other groups. the outlier position of the two northern samples detected in several genetic comparisons supports the concept of isolation by geographic distance with subsequent differentiation.

most differences in genetic structure were highly significant. only the mixed han sample  <cit>  and the pinghua han  <cit>  with multi-ethnic origin showed no significant difference in several comparisons, along with the laos sample when compared to the vietnam sample  <cit> , as shown in the previous section .

an mds plot for visualization of the amova results is depicted in figure  <dig>  the positioning of the samples did not change when nonsignificant fst values  were excluded. in this correspondence analysis, the population sample from laos clustered with the samples from vietnam  <cit>  and thailand  <cit>  and the southern indigenous minorities  <cit> . this might be explained by the fact that these four samples do not represent ethnic entities, but are a similar combination of several groups. the partly shared political history of the three neighboring countries could have facilitated migrations.

the other populations appeared more distant from the laos sample: the austro-asiatic  <cit>  and the cluster of the guangdong han  <cit> , pinghua han  <cit>  and the sample from hong kong  <cit>  were closer, the cluster of southern han  <cit> , mixed han  <cit>  and southern tibeto-burmans  <cit>  at an intermediate distance, while the remaining groups, i.e. the hmong and mien  <cit> , the daic  <cit> , the northern samples  as well as the island southeast asians  <cit>  localized further away.

obviously, the han population samples did not cluster in the correspondence analysis. although assigned to the same nationality, they are distant from each other genetically. the mixed han  <cit>  localized between the northern and southern han  <cit>  - as expected near their sister sino-tibetan branch, the southern tibeto-burman sample  <cit>  - while the pinghua  <cit>  and the guangdong  <cit>  han samples with minority background and the sample from hong kong  <cit>  clustered between the other southeast asian populations rather than with the other han samples. this reflects the process of assimilation of indigenous populations along with the han expansion  <cit>  and the particular genetic composition of hong kong  <cit>  possibly caused by a history distinct from the rest of today's china. our findings further point out the importance of subdatasets even for large ethnic groups, as reported before  <cit> . it was also meaningful to separate the hmong and mien population samples  <cit> , that are usually combined based on linguistics, as they differ genetically .

understanding the genetic history of laos
the rapid initial colonization of southeast asia at some time after  <dig> kybp along the "southern coastal route" was followed by an expansion in situ , a dispersal into the continent and onto the islands, and the subsequent differentiation of ethnic groups with common origin but diverging lineages   <cit> . we confirmed this in our analyses: the novel basal m haplogroups found in high diversity in the laos sample and surrounding populations support the fast migration and in situ differentiation model . despite of little evolutionary time, the linguistically separated groups also clearly differed genetically .

the original genetic structure of msea with distinct areas inhabited by the main ethnic groups - the daic in the coastal areas of the southeast, the austro-asiatic in western and central msea, the sino-tibetan  in the north and the hmong-mien in today's central china - has been blurred by massive migrations  <cit> . in the past  <dig> years, the tibeto-burmans moved from the northwest and the himalayan area to the south, absorbing indigenous lineages  <cit> . in the past  <dig> years, several waves of han expansions to the west and south caused massive displacements of indigenous minorities  <cit> . the daic were forced southward by the expanding han in a fanning spread and are now mainly found west of hong kong. in today's laos, they formed small city states in the north from the late 11th century ad and later moved to the central and southern plains, thereby repelling the austro-asiatic population to the highlands or assimilating them. today, the daic "lowlander" living in the plains and along the rivers constitute the major proportion  of the laos population. they are dominant in language, culture, media and politics  <cit> . the hmong-mien are the newest arrival: they were continuously forced to the southwestern areas already settled by austro-asiatic and southern tibeto-burmans. they immigrated to the hilly north of laos only in the past several hundred years and today exhibit a pattern of refuge , rather than a positive expansion  <cit> .

traces of these migrations might be visible in the extant mtdna composition of laos. to shed more light on the population genetic history, it was meaningful to compare the cross-sectional laos sample to those of the ethnic groups that together constitute the population of this country.

an interesting picture was revealed : the ethnic population with the highest similarity to the laos sample in terms of shared haplotypes, mpd, pairwise fst values and localization in the mds plot were the austro-asiatic  <cit> . this was unexpected, as the "midlander" only constitute 20-25% of the laotian population, being the major group only in some regions  <cit> . given the fact that the daic sample  <cit>  localized at much further distance from the laos sample in the correspondence analysis , had a higher corrected mpd value and less shared haplotypes, our findings indicate a great proportion of assimilated austro-asiatic lineages in the daic-dominated laos.

the ethnic samples second closest to the laos sample in the mds plot were the three "highlander" southern sino-tibetan groups , while other "highlander", the hmong and mien  <cit> , appeared far from the laos sample. this might reflect expanding sino-tibetan tribes immigrating from the northwest of msea, and is in agreement with the reported migration routes . both in the shared haplotypes analysis  and the mds plot , there was only small evidence for admixture by northern sino-tibetan groups , suggesting that these migrations were minor concerning the area of today's laos or blurred by the admixture by indigenous females to immigrating northern groups . specific, but limited northern traces were found in the laos sample, however .

CONCLUSIONS
the cross-sectional laotian sample presented here is highly suitable for genetic purposes regarding the countrywide mtdna variation. subpopulation and regional databases for detailed population genetic investigations and reliable forensic frequency estimates are desirable and need more extensive sampling. new phylogenetic lineages were detected: this sample will significantly contribute to further clarification of the southeast asian mtdna phylogeny and the development of region specific filters for network constructions  <cit> . the limited codr sequence analysis considerably increased phylogenetic resolution, suggesting that complete mitochondrial genome sequencing and analyzing a greater number of samples and populations will help to identify additional new lineages, yielding a more realistic picture of human mtdna diversity, dispersal history and a higher power of discrimination for forensic purposes.

this first laos dataset reveals a highly diverse population in terms of mtdna composition, possibly reflecting the contribution of several major ethnolinguistic groups and a complex migration history. the laotian population sample showed to be highly differentiated and lies well amid other southeast asian populations in terms of haplogroup structure, diversity indices and sharing of haplotypes. nevertheless, its genetic structure was significantly different from  <dig> east asian groups included in the comparisons. our sample gives strong indication for a mixed southeast asian aboriginal origin of the extant laos population along with limited northern east asian contributions, with highest similarity to austro-asiatic and southern sino-tibetan populations. this finding was unexpected, as the daic are culturally dominant in laos, but is in agreement with the ethnic divisions of southeast asia before the han expansions, where the austro-asiatic lived in this central area of today's laos  <cit> . however, this mtdna study reflecting the maternal history of laos is only one piece of the puzzle. y-chromosomal and autosomal markers will allow further, and possibly contrary, insights into the complex migration and population history of laos and southeast asia  <cit> .

the haplotypes presented in this study will be available on the empop database http://www.empop.org  and on genbank  upon publication. this publication follows the recommendations of the international society of forensic genetics on the use of mtdna in forensic analyses.
