BACKGROUND
the formation of muscle during embryonic development involves the differentiation of myoblasts into long, fibrous cells. in this differentiation process, myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and fuse into multinucleate, syncytial myotubes  <cit> . the microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized from a radial network into a parallel array of filaments aligned along the long axis of the cells  <cit> . it is believed that this reorganization is a prerequisite for the elongation and fusion of myoblasts, and for the subsequent alignment and organization of sarcomeres  <cit> . microtubule reorganization is paralleled by reorganization of centrosomal proteins: myoblasts possess a morphologically recognizable centrosome with characteristic marker proteins concentrated in the pericentriolar material, whereas myotubes show perinuclear localization of a multitude of centrosome proteins  <cit> . consequently, polymerization of microtubules is initiated in part from the surface of the nucleus  <cit> . it has been reported that reorganization of microtubules and relocalization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear surface occurs after fusion of myoblasts into myotubes  <cit> . however, the precise kinetics of this reorganization are unknown. morover, it is unknown how centrosome proteins are attached to the nuclear surface, and how they are organized at the ultrastructural level.

RESULTS
in order to determine at what stage of the differentiation process relocalization of centrosome proteins occurs, we performed cell culture of mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts and triggered differentiation by serum withdrawal. alternatively, we used h-2kb-tsa <dig> mouse myoblasts, carrying a thermolabile t-antigen and allowing differentiation upon temperature shift from  <dig> to 37Â°c  <cit> . in the undifferentiated state, the centrosomal proteins of both cell lines were found in a single focus within the pericentriolar material adjacent to the nucleus, while the protein pcm- <dig>  localized to multiple 'centriolar satellites', as described by  <cit>  and  <cit> . one day after differentiation of myoblasts was triggered, we observed centrosome proteins at the nuclear periphery already at the single cell stage, prior to fusion into myotubes .

we investigated the pattern of various proteins and found that significant amounts of pericentrin and pcm- <dig> accumulated at the nuclear periphery, whereas the centrosome protein cdk5rap <dig> showed partial relocalization. only minor amounts of gamma-tubulin were found at the nuclear periphery, consistent with data from  <cit> , and the protein ninein was not found to relocalize to the nuclear periphery in our experiments.

a closer look at differentiating c2c <dig> cells revealed that at the single cell stage, proteins such as pericentrin and pcm- <dig> started to accumulate at the nuclear periphery in the proximity of the centrosome, whereas areas of the nuclear envelope distal from the centrosome showed less centrosome protein enrichment . at the same time, remnant pericentrin and cdk5rap <dig> were still visible at the centrosome, and pcm- <dig> was still partly localized in pericentriolar satellites . the early relocalization of these proteins from the centrosome to nearby sites of the nuclear surface raises the question as to whether direct transfer from the centrosome is involved, or whether the proteins are recruited to the nuclear surface from a soluble cytoplasmic pool. both scenarios seem possible: direct transfer from the centrosome to the nucleus might occur by diffusion. alternatively, at the onset of differentiation, proteins such as pericentrin might be recruited from a soluble pool and localize to the nuclear surface next to the centrosome due to minus-end directed transport along microtubules  <cit> , since the microtubule-organizing centre in these myoblasts is strongly focused at the centrosome and would thus favour deposit of pericentrin in the surrounding area . it is noteworthy, however, that already at the single cell stage microtubules were reorganized into a sun-like array radiating from the nuclear periphery within those cells displaying perinuclear relocalization of centrosome proteins .

to verify that these cells had indeed entered the differentiation programme, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy with differentiation markers. we noticed that all cells in which the centrosome protein pcm- <dig> had relocalized to the nuclear surface showed cytoplasmic expression of embryonic myosin, an isoform of myosin that is specifically expressed upon onset of muscle cell differentiation . furthermore, these cells expressed the differentiation marker myogenin, a transcription factor that localizes to the nucleus of differentiating cells . this marker was absent from cells showing pericentriolar pcm- <dig> staining. conversely, these cells with pericentriolar pcm- <dig> were the only ones that stained positively for the proliferation marker ki- <dig> in the nucleus, whereas nuclei in cells with relocalized pcm- <dig> did not contain ki- <dig> . once relocalization of pcm- <dig> occurred, it persisted until the final stages of differentiation: we detected pcm- <dig> around the nuclear surface after fusion of multiple c2c <dig> cells into myotubes . moreover, nuclei in muscle from adult mice showed comparable staining of pcm- <dig> at their surface .

we next sought to determine whether centrosome proteins that had assembled around the nucleus were bound at the inside or at the outside of the nuclear envelope. for this purpose, we transfected mouse myoblasts with gfp-tagged lamin a, a protein of the inner nuclear envelope. deconvolution microscopy revealed that the centrosome protein pcm- <dig> localized in a rim slightly outside of lamin a , suggesting that pcm- <dig> associates with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope. because the pcm- <dig> staining at the nuclear surface was visible in small clusters, we tested whether these sites co-localized with nuclear pores. however, double immunofluorescence with an antibody against a family of nuclear pore complex proteins indicated that most of the pcm- <dig> clusters were distinct from nuclear pores . to reveal further structural details, we performed immuno-electron microscopy of ultra-thin cryosections of differentiated c2c <dig> cells. pcm- <dig> was detected with antibodies and gold-coupled protein a. this technique preserved cellular membranes and showed that pcm- <dig> localized mainly outside the nucleus, away from the outer nuclear membrane . consistent with our immunofluorescence data, immunogold labelling of pcm- <dig> was often seen in clusters . the gold was mostly seen along grey electron-dense material surrounding the nuclear surface . this electron-dense material had a thickness between  <dig> and  <dig> nm, suggesting that was part of a tight matrix.

to test for the biochemical behaviour of perinuclear pcm-1-containing material, we purified nuclei from differentiated c2c <dig> cells that had fused into myotubes. these were separated from non-differentiated myoblasts by short treatment of cultures with trypsin, leading to selective enrichment of the differentiated cells. following fractionation of cells, we performed extraction of purified nuclei with buffer containing various concentrations of salt, detergents, or urea. we found that perinuclear pcm- <dig> localization was largely resistant to  <dig>  m nacl, to treatment with 1% triton x- <dig>  or even to extraction with  <dig> m urea . however, pcm- <dig> was efficiently removed from the nuclear surface in  <dig> m urea, or in buffer containing the denaturing detergent sds  . nuclei treated with sds lost their integrity even after short times of treatment, and could therefore not be quantified reproducibly. altogether, these results indicate that pcm- <dig> is part of an insoluble matrix in differentiated muscle cells. taking into account that several centrosome proteins form a fibrous meshwork surrounding the centrioles in undifferentiated cells  <cit> , it seems plausible to assume that a similar fibrous meshwork forms around the nucleus during differentiation. proteins such as pericentrin that have large predicted alpha-helical domains, and the potential to form coiled-coil interactions, might contribute to the formation of such a meshwork.

to further characterize the nature of the perinuclear meshwork of centrosome proteins, we designed an in-vitro-approach to determine whether its formation was reversible in differentiated c2c <dig> cells upon re-entry into the cell cycle. because muscle cells become postmitotic after differentiation, as shown by the lack of ki- <dig> staining , cultures of differentiated c2c <dig> cells could not simply be driven into mitosis. to circumvent this problem, we isolated nuclei from differentiated cells and incubated them in cycling egg extracts from xenopus laevis . these extracts are capable of mimicking cell cycle events such as s-phase and mitosis in vitro, and assemble mitotic spindles around various sources of dna, including exogenously added nuclei .

we noticed that upon entry of these extracts into a prometaphase-like state, c2c <dig> nuclei began to disassemble. dna condensed into mitotic chromosomes, and the perinuclear 'matrix' of pcm- <dig> disintegrated into a system of interwoven fibres, and finally disassembled into protein aggregates of varying sizes . we performed deconvolution microscopy on nuclei, stained with various markers, in s-phase and prometaphase. we found that pcm- <dig>  pericentrin, gamma-tubulin, as well as the nuclear envelope protein nesprin  <dig> localized to patches on the nuclear envelope that were closely apposed, but without fully co-localizing with each other . in samples that had entered prometaphase, we found that pcm- <dig>  pericentrin, and nesprin  <dig> localized to spots and interconnected fibres that co-localized partly, whereas gamma-tubulin was found more diffusely distributed . we therefore believe that pcm- <dig> and pericentrin form distinct fibrillar structures at the outer nuclear surface that are connected at various contact sites, thus constituting a tight matrix. this matrix may be structurally equivalent to the fibrous pericentriolar material in undifferentiated cells, and it can be disassembled or at least loosened upon entry into mitosis. consistently, many centrosome proteins, including pcm- <dig> and pericentrin, are seen in undifferentiated cells during mitosis in a wide crescent-shaped area at the spindle poles or diffuse in the cytoplasm, whereas in interphase they are more focused at the centrosome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this manuscript, we demonstrate that relocalization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear surface is an early event during the differentiation of myoblasts, which occurs prior to their fusion into myotubes. this may imply that the relocalization is important for subsequent differentiation events, for example by affecting microtubule organization. further, we show that centrosome proteins form a filamentous matrix around the outer surface of the nuclear envelope. our biochemical experiments demonstrate that this matrix is highly insoluble, but disassembles in mitotic cytoplasm. the assembly and disassembly characteristics of this matrix may provide general insights into the organization of the pericentriolar material of centrosome proteins. future work will be needed to determine the molecular mechanisms that lead to re-localization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear surface upon muscular differentiation.
