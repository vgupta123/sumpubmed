BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is the major cause of gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. it is a self-limiting disease with the symptoms varying from watery diarrhoea with no inflammation to mucous containing bloody diarrhoea  <cit> . a rare but life-threatening consequence of c. jejuni infection is the neurological disorder guillain barré syndrome  <cit> . campylobacter infections are mainly transmitted through poultry and related products, but unpasteurised milk products, contaminated water and other food products have also been implicated as potential sources  <cit> .

c. jejuni is believed to be an invasive pathogen and invasion of, or translocation across, the intestinal epithelium is thought to disrupt the gut lining and bring about an inflammatory response resulting in diarrhoea. the presence of blood and mucous in the stool in some patients provides evidence of the invasive ability of c. jejuni  <cit> . several studies have used in vitro cultured cell lines of human and non-human origin to investigate c. jejuni interaction with host cells . in addition, in vivo animal infection models including primates have been used to study the role of invasion and adhesion in c. jejuni pathogenesis . it is apparent that c. jejuni’s ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells is influenced by the infection model or the type of intestinal cell line used . it is also strain dependent, often influenced by the severity of the clinical symptoms  <cit> . one previous study quantitatively classified the invasion potential of c. jejuni strains isolated from clinical, poultry and environmental sources as hyper, high or low using an in vitro invasion assay with the hyper-invasive group consisting of a greater proportion of clinical isolates compared to isolates from other sources  <cit> . further analysis of one of these hyper-invasive strains, 01/ <dig>  led to the identification of a number of genes associated with the hyper-invasive phenotype  <cit> , and in particular that of the lipooligosaccharide  biosynthesis gene, cj <dig>  <cit> .

surface polysaccharides including los and capsule have been implicated in adherence and invasion of epithelial cells and in an in vitro ferret model of infection . c. jejuni was only reported as having a capsule once the very first genome sequence was completed in  <dig>  and it was reported to be the major determinant of the penner serotyping scheme  <cit> . the capsular polysaccharide  region in c. jejuni in general has a similar structure to that in other organisms and is composed of three regions: two conserved regions encoding the proteins involved with assembly and transport which flank the central variable region composed of the genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. the cps region varies in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp with the central variable region consisting of 11– <dig> orfs  <cit> . recently, mosaicism in the cps locus was reported with the presence of cps genes elsewhere on the genome of c. jejuni strain x that were thought to add to the antigenic variability of the cps  <cit> . c. jejuni capsules are known to contain o-methyl phosphoramidate  modifications which in c. jejuni nctc <dig> are synthesised by the products of cj1415c-1418c  <cit> . these genes, along with cj1419c and cj1420c have homologs in 61 % of the published cps loci available  <cit> . the meopn modification of the cps was shown to have a role in virulence in the galleria mellonella model  <cit>  and more recently loss of the meopn modification was shown to increase invasion into caco- <dig> cells and decrease resistance to killing by serum  <cit> . a number of genes associated with heptose biosynthesis  have also been reported as being conserved amongst the cps region in c. jejuni.

in this study we have investigated the group of hyper-invasive c. jejuni isolates at the whole genome level. we reveal mosaicism in the cps region and elsewhere in the genome with the apparent import of genes from c. jejuni subsp. doylei, c. lari and c. coli which may contribute to the hyper-invasive phenotype of these strains. we also show that hyper-invasive strains do not belong to a defined lineage but are phylogenetically distributed across the species. however, the hyper-invasive strains all share identical gene sequences, or alleles, in a number of loci including key flagella genes and a second cdt operon not reported before in c. jejuni, indicating that these loci are strongly associated with the hyper-invasive phenotype.

RESULTS
hyper-invasive strains are distributed across the c. jejuni phylogeny
all six isolates identified as hyper-invasive in our previous studies  <cit>  , were genome sequenced using the illumina sequencing platform. the phylogenetic position of the six isolates was then determined from a core genome alignment incorporating all available c. jejuni reference genomes as well as the  <dig> genomes previously sequenced by sheppard et al.  <cit> . the resulting phylogeny clearly showed that the hyper-invasive phenotype is not a lineage specific trait . three of the hyper-invasive strains  are part of the host generalist and widely distributed clonal complex  <dig>  <cit> , many of which have been assayed for invasion phenotype and shown not to be hyper-invasive  <cit> . these three strains are not grouped together and are randomly distributed across the phylogeny. additionally, two further hyper-invasive strains, 01/ <dig> and ex <dig>  which belong to the clonal complex  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, are found at the opposite end of the species phylogeny, providing support for the hypothesis that hyper-invasion is an acquired trait that can occur in any c. jejuni lineage.table  <dig> list of strains used for pan-genome analysis in our study

evidence of genetic import from c. lari and c. doylei in the capsular polysaccharide region of hyper-invasive strains
since our earlier study identified a role for lps modification in invasion  <cit> , and a previous dna microarray study  indicated that the capsular polysaccharide region of c. jejuni strain 01/ <dig> was divergent to that in other campylobacters, this region was studied in more detail in all six of the hyper-invasive genomes to investigate whether other surface structures might play a role in this phenotype. the overall structure of this region in the hyper-invasive strains is similar to other reported cps loci with a central variable region flanked by conserved genes associated with capsule transport and assembly. the size of the locus varies amongst the hyper-invasive strains with strains 01/ <dig> and 01/ <dig> having the smallest locus of just  <dig>  746 bp and 01/ <dig> having the largest locus of  <dig>  bp, including the flanking transport and assembly regions. the number of genes in the central variable region ranges from just eight in strain 01/ <dig> and 01/ <dig> to  <dig> in strain 01/ <dig>  genes associated with meopn modification  are present in all of the hyper-invasive strains, however the conserved heptose biosynthesis genes  are only present in one of these strains, 01/ <dig>  all of the hyper-invasive strains have a common set of six genes  adjacent to the kpsc gene orthologue , which are absent from the previously characterised low invasive strain  <dig>  this set of genes is also present in nctc <dig>  which displayed high invasion levels in our previous study  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparison of the capsular polysaccharides  locus of the six hyper-invasive strains  with that in the low invasive strain c. jejuni  <dig> and the hyper-virulent c. jejuni strain ia <dig>  isolated from aborted sheep. cps loci from all strains were compared using blastn and visualised using easyfig. cdss are colour-coded to indicate putative gene function, with the conserved kps genes coloured grey. grey scale indicates blastn similarity between cdss



comparison of the cps locus across a wider set of campylobacter genomes identified that the capsule locus for 01/ <dig> was identical to that reported in the reference genome of c. jejuni strain ia <dig>  known to be a hyper-virulent strain, isolated from an aborted sheep  <cit>  . blastn analysis of capsule genes with no identity to other known c. jejuni genes in both 01/ <dig> and 01/ <dig> returned high identity hits to cps genes in c. jejuni subsp. doylei and c. lari . this cross species similarity was also observed within the capsular variable region of ia <dig>  which as mentioned above was determined to be highly invasive . this similarity was not observed for the capsule locus in c. jejuni  <dig>  which is the only available low invasive reference strain . our data suggests that the phylogenetically disparate hyper-invasive strains share similarities in import of non-c. jejuni genes into the capsule locus. we tested the ability of the hyper-invasive strains to survive exposure to human serum in comparison to low invasive reference strains and found no differences .fig.  <dig> comparison of the capsular polysaccharide  locus of two of the c. jejuni hyper-invasive strains , c. jejuni  <dig> and the hyper-virulent c. jejuni strain ia <dig>  isolated from aborted sheep, with the cps locus from c. jejuni subsp. doylei  <dig> and c. lari rm <dig>  cps loci from all strains were compared using blastn and visualised in easyfig. cdss are colour-coded to indicate putative gene function. grey scale indicates blastn similarity between cdss



core genome analysis revealed a number of hyper-invasive unique genes with similarity to genes from other campylobacter species
given our observation of genetic import at the capsule locus, and the lack of phylogenetic clustering of hyper-invasive strains, we decided to further investigate any other instances of shared gene content that may account for the observed hyper-invasive phenotype. a pan genome was constructed using ls-bsr, from the six hyper-invasive strains, c. jejuni  <dig> and an additional six strains previously sequenced by our research group  <cit>  that are known to be low-invasive. group specific genetic loci were then identified using the accompanying compare-bsr.py script  <cit> . a number of loci were identified as either unique to the hyper-invasive strains or these strains had allelic variants of cdss present in c. jejuni . this finding was further confirmed by blastx comparison of each individual cds to the entire non-redundant nucleotide database. this analysis verified that many of the hyper-invasion associated loci were either unique to the hyper-invasive strains or only had orthologues in other species such as c. jejuni subsp. doylei, c. coli and c. lari , indicating possible import of these loci as observed in the capsule locus . many of these cdss were involved in sugar and acyl transfer reactions or hypothetical proteins .table  <dig> list of loci identified as associated with hyper-invasive c. jejuni isolates

interestingly, there was variability in sequence of some well-defined c.jejuni virulence genes with alleles conserved in all hyper-invasive strains. most striking was a set of genes identified as a second cdt operon by blastx comparison. the cdta, b and c genes showed 81 % similarity to gene baj <dig> from c. lari, 81 % similarity to baj <dig> from c. lari, and 83 % similarity to baj <dig> from c. lari respectively. the secondary cdt operon was present in addition to the classic cdt operon found in abundance across the species. a visual comparison of the cdt loci identical to that performed for the capsule locus was undertaken. the nucleotide sequence similarity levels of 60–80 % suggest the secondary cdt operon is a paralog of the classical operon. however the secondary cdt operon showed more similarity at a phylogenetic level to the classical c. jejuni cdt operon than those of c. jejuni subsp. doylei and c. lari, and the orientation of the genes was in reverse to the classical cdt operon. .

we focussed on the flagella genes and the secondary cdt operon and performed phylogenetic analysis of these regions. for the flagella genes, we extracted this locus from the core genome alignment and then determined a maximum likelihood phylogeny . the phylogenetic tree showed comprehensively that flgd, e and flgl sequences are highly conserved in all six of the hyper-invasive strains and are divergent from the majority of versions found across the species. the hyper-invasive flagella genes form a distinct secondary clade that contains nine other c. jejuni strains that have not been characterised for invasion capacity . for the second cdt operon, we aligned the sequences in hyper-invasive strains against all available cdta alleles available on the campylobacter bigsdb website  and created a maximum likelihood phylogeny . this approach was taken as the cdt operon was not present in every genome included in fig.  <dig>  and to ensure as comprehensive an analysis as possible against the full diversity of the cdt locus within c. jejuni. the phylogenetic separation of the cdt is even more apparent with the six hyper-invasive secondary cdt operons forming a highly divergent clade from all other c. jejuni alleles of cdt that have been sequenced . blast analysis suggested the hyper-invasive cdt genes were similar to those found in c. jejuni subsp. doylei and c. lari.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny of the concatenated sequences of flgd, e and l extracted from all  <dig> genomes used to create the core genome phylogeny. the hyper-invasive isolates are highlighted in red

to confirm that this allele sharing between the hyper-invasive strains was not a random event, we determined the likelihood of any given gene allele being shared between strains belonging to the three phylogenetic clades containing the hyper-invasive strains . a pan-genome matrix of all strains belonging to the three clades was created in ls-bsr and the number of alleles shared between these three clades measured. a total of  <dig> genetic loci were compared and of those  <dig> shared an identical allele across the three clades containing hyper-invasive isolates, giving a probability of random allele sharing between these clades of  <dig> . this provides strong statistical support that the cdt and flagella gene alleles shared between the hyper-invasive strains are not random and are associated with the shared phenotype of hyper-invasion.

discussion
despite enormous research efforts and a significant body of literature examining the pathogenesis of c. jejuni, the virulence mechanisms of this highly diverse bacterial species remain somewhat enigmatic. a previous population phenotype study, uncovered very large diversity in the levels to which environmental and clinical isolates of c. jejuni invaded cultured intestinal epithelial cells in vitro  <cit> . the existence of isolates showing a hyper-invasive phenotype raised the possibility that a sub-population of c. jejuni exists which may cause a more invasive clinical disease  <cit> . furthermore, the hyper-invasive strain 01/ <dig> was previously studied by transposon and targeted mutagenesis and a number of genes involved in the hyper-invasive phenotype of this strain were identified  <cit> .

in this study, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of all six isolates previously shown to display the highest levels of invasion an in vitro assay  <cit> . to place our results in the context of the wider c. jejuni population, we utilised the comprehensive genome sequence data produced by sheppard et al.  <cit> , investigating the ecology of c. jejuni lineages. the resulting whole genome phylogeny clearly showed the hyper-invasive phenotype is a trait that has been randomly acquired across distinct lineages. three of our six hyper-invasive strains belong to the clonal complex  <dig>  one of the most common host-generalist lineages of c. jejuni  <cit>  which has been shown to contain low and hyper-invasive strains  <cit> . as such studies of genotypic and phenotypic traits associated with propensity to human pathogenesis have identified loci or traits that are phylogenetically distributed across the species  <cit> .

our previous research using dna microarray showed that the hyper-invasive strain 01/ <dig>  lacked many capsule genes found in the other c. jejuni strains sequenced at that time . a gene homologous to cj <dig> in c. jejuni nctc <dig>  encoding for a glycosyltransferase with a role in the modification of los was shown to be essential for the hyper-invasive phenotype of c. jejuni 01/ <dig>  <cit> . the capsule region in c. jejuni is postulated to play an important role in adhesion, invasion and increased virulence in surrogate infection models  <cit> . owing to the importance of surface related structures in the pathogenesis of c. jejuni, we decided to investigate the capsule locus in detail in our hyper-invasive strains. our data showed a high degree of variability in capsule locus architecture across the hyper-invasive isolates, perhaps not surprising given the phylogenetic distance between them, though interestingly the differences in architecture between the st21-complex hyper-invasive isolates were just as great as they were across the more distantly related isolates. despite this variability, there was a conservation of capsule locus genes with high similarity to genes found in c. jejuni subsp. doylei, c. coli and c. lari. interspecies recombination has been shown to be a frequent event in the campylobacter genus to the extent that it has blurred the species boundary in some lineages  <cit> . however, there are no reports in the literature of this being associated with a specific alteration in an important phenotype such as host-cell interaction. wu et al. recently noted the similarity in the cps locus of the hyper-virulent c. jejuni strain ia <dig> and genes in c. lari and c. jejuni subsp. doylei, the latter frequently associated with bacteraemia  <cit> . it has to be noted that there is limited data definitively linking these genes with the hyper-invasive phenotype with only one of our previous transposon mutants occurring in this locus  <cit> . however, the level of variability in the capsule locus suggests that the association between genotype and phenotype in this region is more complex than would be detected by classical single-gene targeted mutagenesis experiments. it may be that different combinations of genes can lead to an antigenically or structurally similar final capsule that confers the phenotype, but this can only be hypothesised when a robust study on the relationship between capsule genetics and final produced capsule is performed. in addition, the capsule locus of our 01/ <dig> strains is completely identical to that found in the reference genome of c. jejuni ia <dig>  these two isolates are phylogenetically distant at the whole genome level, but c. jejuni ia <dig> is classified as a hyper-virulent veterinary isolate of c. jejuni having been identified as the causative agent of highly aggressive infection in sheep resulting in abortive pregnancy  <cit> . interestingly, despite the identical cps locus in these two strains they differ in their penner serotype with c. jejuni ia <dig> having a serotype of hs: <dig>   <cit>  and c. jejuni 01/ <dig> with hs <dig>  <cit> , confirming the fact that the cps is not the sole determinant of the penner serotyping scheme.

further investigation into the pan-genome of the hyper-invasive c. jejuni isolates compared to a selection of low-invasive c. jejuni isolates, using the ls-bsr suite of tools identified a number of other loci associated with hyper-invasion. such an approach has been successfully applied to identify genes associated with niche restriction in cattle-associated c. jejuni lineages that was also experimentally verified  <cit> . the genes found were involved with glycosylation of surface moieties and genes with hypothetical function. a lps modification gene, cj <dig>  which was previously identified as being involved in the hyper-invasive phenotype of strain c. jejuni 01/ <dig>  by transposon and targeted mutagenesis was among the genes identified in our study, validating our analysis  <cit> . a large number of the loci also showed high identity with genes in c. jejuni subsp. doylei, c. coli and c. lari providing more weight to the suggestion that inter-species introgression of loci is strongly associated with the hyper-invasive phenotype.

of most interest is our finding that the hyper-invasive strains carried specific alleles of flagella genes and the virulence associated cytolethal distending toxin genes. the phylogenetic analysis of these loci across the c. jejuni species provides strong evidence that these alleles are significantly associated with hyper-invasion. the flagella of c. jejuni have long been associated with virulence and invasion. motility has been shown to be essential for cellular invasion  <cit>  and flagella are also thought to act as the delivery machinery for the type iii secretion system cia effector proteins which have been shown to facilitate invasion by c. jejuni  <cit> . the flgk, e, and l genes identified in our screen all encode flagella basal body apparatus proteins suggesting that any form of antigenic variation in flagella in the hyper-invasive strains is unlikely. however, the structural or functional effects that these hyper-invasive specific alleles may have on flagella merits further detailed investigation. all previous transposon mutants in the flagella region of hyper-invasive strain 01/ <dig> were discounted from further analysis due to the well-documented link between invasion and motility and re-characterising mutants in this region will allow us to further probe the link between hyper-invasion specific flagella behaviour and the invasive phenotype.

the most striking hyper-invasion associated allele is that of the secondary putative cdt, with all the hyper-invasive isolates containing cdt alleles which form a distinct secondary clade from all other c. jejuni alleles discovered to date. the cytolethal distending toxin has been suggested to be involved in modulating cytokine secretion by infected host cells and assist in intracellular survival of c. jejuni  <cit> . however, clinical isolates have been discovered with natural deletion mutations in the cdt operon, and analysis of human sera suggests the cdt toxin is strongly immunogenic  <cit> . the secondary cdt allele associated with our hyper-invasive strains appears ancestral to the c. jejuni variants but is present in addition to the classic cdt operon found throughout the species suggesting it may be maintained in these strains for a defined purpose. blastx analysis of the entire non-redundant database identified just a single c. jejuni ortholog in strain  <dig>  <cit>  and no matching alleles for any loci in the c. jejuni bigsdb database. a detailed molecular analysis of these secondary cdt operon genes is now required to unravel their role in the hyper-invasion phenotype and their origin in these isolates.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of a group of c. jejuni isolates previously shown by our group to exhibit a hyper-invasive phenotype in vitro. our data suggests that genetic import from campylobacter species other than c. jejuni is strongly associated with this phenotype. in particular, the highly variable capsule region displays patterns of genetic import from c. jejuni. subsp. doylei and c. lari. we also show that many loci identified as unique to the hyper-invasive isolates in a c. jejuni pan-genome analysis are orthologs of genes found in the other campylobacter species. finally, we show significant association between specific alleles of flagella and cdt genes and the hyper-invasive phenotype. our data provides a targeted framework with which to further understand important phenotypic variations across the c. jejuni population.
