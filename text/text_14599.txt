BACKGROUND
genomics research, as a field of study, is largely a creature of the past two decades and is generally defined as the study of whole genomes. the term genomics came into common use in  <dig> to distinguish "high throughput" data- and technology-intensive approaches to studying dna structure and function from the more established approach of studying dna structure and function of individual genes. the history of genomics research is embedded in the human genome project and its parallel private sector components. in  <dig>  with the completion of a high-quality sequence of the human genome, the national human genome research institute  of the national institutes of health  announced that "the genomic era is now a reality"  <cit> . genomics has become central to biomedical and disease-based research; genomic technologies are being used to identify genetic factors involved in nine of the ten leading causes of death in the united states .

as the social and personal implications of genomics research have become apparent , the public has become increasingly interested in understanding genomics. genomics is being used in many populations for purposes such as large genome-wide population studies, personalized genomics, and genomic ancestry tests. genomics has become an issue of interest to the general public, and an element of current culture, as evidenced by several articles in the popular press  <cit> . as genomics is incorporated into health care  <cit> , law enforcement  <cit> , ancestry tracing  <cit> , and other activities, feelings of hope and fear surrounding individual genomic sequencing have emerged  <cit>  and public funding allocated to genomics research has increased .

most countries provide public funding for scientific research, under some variation of a mission to promote or improve the nation's health. many countries are investing in genomics as an element of biotechnology, and as a pathway to economic development. the rise of genomics funding results from the priority that governments have placed on such research, which is influenced by policy decisions. one of the foremost issues in genome research policy is allocation of funds and research prioritization  <cit> . research prioritization is determined by stakeholders with varying perspectives; therefore each country, and in fact each organization, is likely to arrive at a different set of priorities, and subsequent allocation of resources.

the individuals who determine research priorities and subsequent allocation of funds for each organization are accountable to the donors who provided funding support; in the public sector, most research funding is derived from taxpayer support. research funding in the united states is distributed by congress, whose members are accountable to citizens and constituents. as "genomics is beginning to bring understanding that everyone is at risk for something based on their genes"  <cit> , public interest in genomics research increases. both those advocating for health research funding to address diseases or health conditions, and policy-makers who determine government resource allocations can use information about funding levels to inform advocacy positions and governmental funding decisions.

to facilitate its input, the public needs access to data, benchmarks, and indicators of current research funding, past funding trends, future projections, and comparisons with funding organizations around the world. several organizations study and publish such data and benchmarks for general r&d funding or health funding, including the r&d budget and policy program of the american association for the advancement of science   <cit> , the division of science resources statistics at the national science foundation   <cit>  and its national science board's science and engineering indicators  <cit> , the statistics portal of the organization for economic cooperation and development   <cit>  and the global forum on health research  <cit> . while the authors of "monitoring financial flows in health research" characterize their estimates as "very rough," they remain the best statistics available on global heath research  <cit> . occasional studies have included reporting on genomics research, including the  <dig> "financial flows" report , which cited a previous survey  that our current survey builds upon. there has been no update specific to genomics since  <dig>  <cit> , however, so we undertook this "world survey" to update and expand that survey. we report the allocation of public funds that countries and organizations in the public sector  provide for genomics research. this survey of public sector funding provides patterns and trends of worldwide genomics funding, allowing for initial comparisons across organizations and countries, and complements an effort to estimate genomics expenditures by private companies  <cit> .

in our survey, we simply asked each organization to provide a quantitative estimate of the amount of genomics research they funded each year; we did not supply a definition of genomics research . to facilitate participation of as many organizations as possible, we encouraged organizations to use their own definitions of genomics, so that funding data could be easily extracted from budget information. some funding organizations did not have a standard definition of genomics research or requested a specific definition. in those cases, we replied that genomics research is defined by research on the entire genome of an organism instead of research on individual genes and gene functions . organizations that were unable to provide estimates for genomics research were not included in the study. this survey does not cover all the organizations or all the countries that publicly fund genomics research. as for any funding table, there is definitional wobble and incomplete reporting. for reasons elaborated below, however, we believe most of the major sources of public funding have been identified and that the funding figures provided here can inform researchers and policymakers on the state of genomics research, at least as rough indicators and for information about trends.

RESULTS
for this world survey of genomics research, we identified  <dig> different organizations, representing  <dig> countries and  <dig> international organizations . an initial response was received from about half , with most of those  supplying the results shown in table  <dig>  the  <dig> organizations that responded to our request but did not provide information cited reasons such as the information not being available in the format requested  or that genomics was not a part of their research portfolio.

genomics research funded, by organization, is shown in millions of us$ per year. the total funding values each year were determined by summing the values from each organization, with the exception of the first row , which is described in the text. rankings were determined by ordering the  <dig> values, where the average of the three previous years was used as a substitute for  <dig> values when the actual  <dig> data was unavailable. the start of each fiscal year is indicated by the superscript character after each organization, where j = january  <dig>  a = april  <dig>  and o = october  <dig> 

*although the fiscal year for the australian government begins july  <dig>  the original data was reported by calendar year.

an estimate for worldwide genomics funding from the responding organizations averages around us$ <dig>  billion for  <dig> –  <dig> . although the table is incomplete for  <dig> due to unavailability of funding amounts for south africa's national research foundation and china, their combined total averaged less than three percent of worldwide government and nonprofit genomics research in  <dig> –  <dig> 

when beginning this survey, we noted that the united states nih publicly reported an estimate of funding for the research area of genetics  <cit> . to find out more about this reporting practice, we requested and received the breakdown of genetics research funding by nih component . in an effort to determine whether the nih considered genomics research to be a subset of genetics research, we requested the definition of genetics research from the office of budget and found that the nih does "not have an official definition" . turning to each of the  <dig> grant-issuing institutes and centers of the nih, we requested information about their definitions for genetics and genomics research. except for the national cancer institute  and the nhgri, discussed below, each institute and center informed us that they did not have a definition for genetics, and that they do not track genomics research funding.

the amount of genetics research funded by nih components  is indicated in thousands of us$; fiscal year  <dig> is an estimate, and fiscal year  <dig> is the president's budget. the values in this table were provided by the nih office of budget .

a nci actual genetics funding for fiscal years  <dig> and  <dig> was $ <dig> , <dig> and $ <dig> , <dig>  respectively, in thousands .

b total nih genetics funding  for fiscal years  <dig> and  <dig> was $ <dig> , <dig> each year, in thousands  <cit> .

the nci provided a definition for both genetics and genomics, and informed us that fiscal year  <dig> marked the first year of data collection on genomics research . in fiscal years  <dig> and  <dig>  nci genomics research funding corresponded to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of genetics funding, respectively , as indicated in table  <dig>  to estimate the amount of genomics research funded by nci in fiscal years  <dig> –  <dig>  we applied the average fraction from  <dig> –  <dig>  to the amount of genetics funding . upon examining the funding history of nhgri  <cit> , we observed that the nhgri genetics values from the nih office of budget  corresponded to the amount of the nhgri total budget, less roadmap transfer, and research management & support. since this value also corresponds to intramural research plus all  research, training, and r&d contracts for human genome project  <cit> , and since its mission "encompasses a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease"  <cit> , this amount appears to be the figure that nhgri reports as genomics research, reflected in table  <dig>  although other institutes and centers support genomics research, they do not report the values, so we present the values from nci and nhgri as a minimum estimate for nih spending on genomics research .

the amount of genomics research funded by the national cancer institute  and the national human genome research institute , in thousands of us$, where fy = fiscal year.

c nci values for fiscal years  <dig> and  <dig> were  <dig> % and  <dig> % of genetics funding, respectively . we estimated the values for fiscal years  <dig> –  <dig> by multiplying the genetics funding values for each year by the average ratio of genomics:genetics funding for fiscal years  <dig> –  <dig> 

d we determined nhgri values as the total nhgri funding appropriation minus roadmap transfer and research management & support .

the  <dig> organizations in the survey account for  <dig> countries directly, as well as indirectly including another  <dig> countries that are eligible for full funding by the european commission . only five of the thirty-three countries fully eligible for european commission funding are directly represented in this world survey . of note, funds from the european commission cover about 50% of the costs of the funded projects; the remaining costs are covered by each institution that receives funding , which are included in table  <dig> as european commission matching funds.

we grouped the organizations by country  into three tiers based on the amount of genomics research funded. the five countries or regions that funded more than us$ <dig> million in genomics research in each of the four years surveyed are the united states, other europe, the united kingdom, canada, and japan. the next tier includes china, germany, the netherlands, south korea, and ireland, which reported between us$ <dig> –  <dig> million in genomics research funding each year  later"  <cit> ). finally, spain, australia, and south africa reported less than us$ <dig> million each year.

the amount of genomics research funded by each country or region is indicated in us$. the region "other europe" refers to funding in european countries for which the table does not directly account , and thus is not included in the rank. rankings were determined by ordering the  <dig> values, where the average of the three previous years was used as a substitute for  <dig> values when the actual  <dig> data was unavailable. data is reported by fiscal year, as indicated in table  <dig> 

* the  <dig> data is incomplete because of missing information from the south african national research foundation or from china's research organizations.

to examine the priority each country places on genomics research, as a measure of "genomics intensity," we normalized public funding for genomics research to the national population  and to gross domestic product . ireland spent approximately us$ <dig> –  <dig> on genomics research per capita while the united kingdom, canada, the united states, and the netherlands funded between us$ <dig>  –  <dig>  per capita each year . japan, south korea, and germany spent between us$ <dig>  –  <dig>  annually per capita on genomics, while the remaining four countries surveyed  spent less than us$ <dig>  annually per capita. genomics funding as a fraction of gdp shows the same relative ranking as genomics funding per capita for the first five countries, followed by south korea, japan, china, germany, south africa, australia, and spain .

the amount of genomics research funded per capita by each country or region is indicated in us$. rankings were determined by ordering the  <dig> values, where the average of the three previous years was used as a substitute for  <dig> values when the actual  <dig> data was unavailable. data is reported by fiscal year, as indicated in table  <dig>

discussion
this survey does not cover all the organizations or countries that publicly fund genomics research. to estimate how well the values reported in this survey correspond to the actual public funding of genomics research in each country, we determined, where possible, the research funders for each country that were not included in this survey .

analysis by country/region
united states
the united states funded about one third of the genomics research reported in this world survey for  <dig> –  <dig> . the amount of funding and funding per capita rose slightly in  <dig> but decreased in  <dig> and  <dig> , while funding per gdp steadily decreased .

over half of the united states contribution was provided by the nih. as described above, we made considerable effort to determine the amount of genomics research funding by each institute and center, but we were only able to quantitate nci and nhgri directly. in these two cases, the amount of genomics research compared to genetics research was just under 10%  and 100% . actual kinds of research undoubtedly differ between nci and nhgri, but a significant portion of the difference is likely attributable to different definitions and reporting practices for "genomics" as a category. if other institutes and centers fund genomics in proportion to genetics research similar to the nci proportion, the additional genomics expenditure  would total $ <dig> –  <dig> million in table  <dig> 

although the nih funded us$ <dig>  –  <dig>  billion of genetics research  we note missing data from four grant-issuing institutes and centers . a simple query of crisp , a searchable database of biomedical research projects funded by the nih and other department of health and human services  components, reveals that each of these nih components does fund genetics and genomics research  <cit> . thus, the actual amount of genetics research is likely to be higher than that reported by nih, and the additional amount of genomics research could be much more than $ <dig> –  <dig> million.

the department of energy  office of biological and environmental research funded genomics research in the life sciences funding category under the subcategories of microbial genomics, genomics: gtl , human genome, and functional genomics/health effects  <cit> . the nsf biological sciences directorate funded genomics research under the following three programs: microbial genome sequencing program, the plant genome project, and the  <dig> project .

genomics funding from the centers for disease control and prevention  increased from us$ <dig>  million  to us$ <dig>  million   <cit> ; part of this increase was due to a change in budget structure in  <dig>  when genomics funding moved from environmental health to health promotion, with slightly different conventions in calculating funding values . the united states department of agriculture  funded genomics research projects through the agricultural research services . the dhs supported genomics research through the science and technology directorate . the howard hughes medical institute  funded genomics research through its science department at us$ <dig> –  <dig> million . the american cancer society provided between us$ <dig> –  <dig> million in genomics research funding .

the us department of defense supports research and development through the defense advanced research projects agency , which pursues research and technology where risk and payoff are both very high  <cit> , and through the united states army with the congressionally directed medical research program   <cit> . darpa sponsored genomics research under the bio/info/micro sciences programs: biocomputational systems and bio interface, and the comparative genomics for national security goals  <cit> . we used the online database of the congressionally directed medical research program to determine the funding for genomics research by searching for awards that were classified in the "genomics and proteomics" research topic  or the "genomics" research topic  or awards that listed "genom%" in the abstract, where% is a wild character  <cit> .

to estimate the completeness of the united states spending on genomics research reported here, we determined the percentage of federal and nonprofit funding on r&d that is covered by the entities in this survey. of the us$ <dig>  –  <dig>  million per year in federally funded research and development in all disciplines , six of the entities included in this survey  accounted for  <dig> – 86%  <cit> . although we were unable to determine the percentage of total research and development funds provided by the nonprofits listed in our survey, the overall contribution of nonprofits towards total research and development funding in the us was 3% in  <dig>  <cit> . combined, these two data indicate that there are unlikely to be major public funders in the united states that are not addressed in this survey, and that the survey accounts for a large majority of total genomics government and nonprofit expenditures in the united states. the remaining public funds for genomics research are likely to be attributable to the government and nonprofit funders identified in this survey that did not supply data, such as the four nih institutes and centers named above, the national aeronautics and space administration  ames center, national institutes of standards and technology , national oceanic and atmostpheric administration , the j. craig venter institute and the institute for genome research , and the bill & melinda gates foundation.

european union
the european commission funds genomics research in the european union, plus iceland, norway, liechtenstein, switzerland, israel, and turkey. in the sixth framework programme of the european commission, covering  <dig> –  <dig>  the major funding areas that included genomics research were advanced genomics and its applications for health, and combating major diseases . european commission funds, including matching funds, provided about 32% of worldwide public genomics research funding in  <dig> . recently, a new european agency was created  that will be an "independent, quality-driven funding body run by the scientists themselves"  <cit>  and will likely increase the public funding of genomics  research in europe.

in an effort to include the european countries funded through the european commission but not otherwise covered in this world survey, we contacted organizations from austria , denmark , estonia , finland , france , hungary , iceland , italy , poland , and sweden , but we received no response from any of these except for the academy of finland and centre national de la recherche scientique , both of which provided an initial response before communication ceased. we also contacted several international organizations active in europe , but were unsuccessful in gathering funding data.

united kingdom
spending on genomics research in the united kingdom decreased slightly in  <dig>  after a steady increase from  <dig> to  <dig> . the united kingdom was the second highest funder of genomics research per capita and per gdp ; both measures of genomics "intensity" declined in  <dig> . the three united kingdom public funders in this survey are cancer research uk, the wellcome trust, and the biotechnology and biological sciences research council , each of which allocated at least 10% of its research monies for genomics. an analysis of the annual reports of the bbsrc shows that  <dig> – 40% of the total research funded  was genomics  <cit> . similarly, the wellcome trust reported spending  <dig> – 38% of its grant expenditures on genomics research  <cit> . finally, the genomics research funded by cancer research uk was estimated at 10% of its charitable expenses .

canada
canada supplied about 6% of total genomics research funding in  <dig> , which increased significantly from a relatively constant contribution in  <dig> –  <dig> . likewise, the genomics intensity measures  increased in  <dig> . its public funding on genomics research is likely to continue increasing, since it recently began a new initiative, the public population project in genomics  <cit> .

four canadian organizations are included in this survey: genome canada, the natural sciences and engineering research council  of canada, the national research council  and the canadian biotechnology strategy . the cbs includes six departments and agencies that are building capacity for new research   <cit> ), although the contribution from nrc  was reduced to avoid double-counting of nrc-funded genomics research . other public funders of genomics research include the canadian institutes of health research , the canada foundation for innovation, and the social sciences and humanities research council, none of these responded to the survey.

japan
japan's spending on genomics research steadily increased between  <dig> and  <dig>  when it reached 5% of worldwide public funding . although its ranking dropped from fourth  to sixth or seventh when adjusted for intensity , genomics research is increasing by all measures, indicating that may be poised to overtake some countries in the coming years. in fact, the second science and technology basic plan  was intended to close the gap between japan and the other g <dig> nations in the percentage of r&d funding provided by government. the third science and technology basic plan, which began in  <dig>  has a goal to increase overall government funding of r&d until the science and technology investment equals 1% of japan's gdp  <cit> .

the values reported in this world survey for japan are likely a near-complete representation of the government's investment in genomics, since the four japanese ministries reported in this survey  are the main government funders of life science and genomics research  <cit> . one nonprofit organization, kazusa dna research institute, was identified and contacted, but did not respond to the survey.

china
our source for china indicated that the central government funded about us$ <dig> million per year of genomics research through the national natural science foundation of china , the chinese academy of sciences , and two programs at the ministry of science and technology : the national high-tech development r&d program  and the national key basic research program . the source also indicated that an equal amount of funding was provided by local governments , yielding a total of us$ <dig> million per year – or about 3% of worldwide public genomics research funding . since our source, a senior official at a publicly funded organization who was not authorized to speak on such issues, preferred to remain anonymous, we made numerous attempts to contact multiple individuals at the above organizations and the united states nsf-beijing for attributable data; unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in gathering the data via those means.

germany
in germany, the federal ministry for education and research  coordinates the r&d initiative for the federal government  <cit> . analysis of genomics research funding by germany, which provided about 2% of the total , revealed that genomics research peaked in 2003; although  <dig> levels were slightly higher than  <dig> and  <dig> levels, by all measures . the national genome research network , established in  <dig> and included in this world survey, is one of two organizations to which bmbf supplied funds for both scientific research and research into the ethical, legal, and economic impacts of genomics  <cit> . the other organization is the german human genome project  <cit> , which was discontinued in june  <dig>  <cit>  and not included in this survey. another public funder, the german research foundation , which promotes research at universities and other publicly financed research institutions  <cit> , did not respond to the survey.

the netherlands
the primary funder of genomics research in the netherlands is the netherlands genomics initiative , which was established by the netherlands organization for scientific research  and five government ministries in  <dig>  the ngi was created to combine existing strengths into one initiative composed of core activities  and research programs  <cit> . netherlands genomics research funding was about 2% of the total in  <dig> ; but its rank jumped from seventh  to fifth when adjusting for genomics intensity .

south korea
in south korea, which accounted for 2% of total genomics research funding in  <dig> , the ministry of science and technology  is the central agency for national science and technology development, including support for basic and applied research and development supported by the government  <cit> , making it likely that the values reported here represent nearly all of the country's genomic research funding. although south korea's funding for genomics research has been increasing steadily since  <dig>  the incoming president has pledged to eliminate four government ministries, possibly merging the most with the ministry of education, which may weaken it  <cit> .

ireland
according to the office of science and technology of the ireland department of enterprise, trade, and employment, three government agencies are responsible for most of the genomics funding in ireland . these three agencies – the higher education authority, the science foundation, and the health research board – are included in this survey. the irish government has recently increased its investment in r&d with the goal of meeting or exceeding the average r&d investment of european union countries  <cit> . indeed, ireland appears to place a high priority on genomics research since its rank increases dramatically from ninth  to first in funding per capita and per gdp . however, ireland's spending on genomics research is likely to be overestimated, since the values reported by the higher education authority include all biomedical/bioscience projects . of note, the science foundation indicated that genomics research represents approximately 19% of its bio-related funding to date . applying the same percentage to the bioscience funding of higher education authority would decrease total genomics research funding in ireland to us$ <dig>  –  <dig>  million per year, corresponding to us$ <dig> –  <dig> per capita.

spain
genoma españa is the foundation for the development of genomic and proteomic research, and is backed by the spanish state through the ministry of health and consumer affairs , and the ministry of education and science   <cit> . genoma españa is one of four main funding centers in biotechnology, along with the center for development of industrial technology  in the ministry of industry, trade and tourism , the instituto de salud carlos iii in the ministry of health and consumer affairs, and the ministry of education and science  <cit> . although spain is a low-ranked by all measures , it has recently developed new government programs to increase total r&d from  <dig> % of gdp to 2% of gdp by  <dig>  <cit> , indicating that spain's overall investment in genomics research is likely to increase.

australia
in australia, the national health and medical research council  is the "peak body" for supporting health and medical research  <cit>  and provided us$ <dig> –  <dig> million for genomics research . two other organizations that fund genomics research, the australian research council, and the australian genome research facility, did not respond to the survey. australia has initiated a national collaborative research infrastructure strategy, which will include funding for genomics research  <cit> , and could serve to increase the amount of funding supplied for genomics research, as it currently accounts for less than 1% of the total funding .

south africa
the government agency responsible for supporting basic and applied research in south africa is the national research foundation  <cit> , while most government funding for health research is funded through the medical research council  <cit> . the amount of genomics research funded by south africa was us$ <dig>  –  <dig>  million for both of these government funders ; the centre for research on science & technology did not respond to our survey.

new zealand
the three main funders of genomics research in new zealand are the foundation for research in science and technology , the royal society, and the health research council . only frst, which represents half of the new zealand government-funded r&d  <cit> , responded. unfortunately, although frst was very willing to provide funding information, staff were unable to segregate their funded research into a category that represented only genomics research, and we could not include them in the tabulation.

middle-income countries with developing genomics sectors
as described by the world health organization, genomics research is beginning to occur in developing countries and regions such as brazil, china, india, and the asia-pacific region  <cit> . we contacted organizations in argentina , india , and russia , as well as the asian technology information program   about their funding of genomics research, but we received no response other than an initial response from the atip before communication ceased. the difficulty we encountered in acquiring an estimate of genomics research expenditures in china is described above. it will take further work and detailed case studies to develop a complete report of genomics research expenditures that are occurring in middle-income countries and developing regions. one such case study is in progress for brazil, where public funders include the national council for scientific and technological development , and the state of são paolo research foundation ; preliminary data indicates that fapesp funded about us$ <dig> million  of genomics research from  <dig> –  <dig>  <cit> .

private funding of genomics research
this study represents only government and non-profit "public" funders of genomics research. the previous survey in  <dig> included private companies, and showed a roughly 2: <dig> ratio of private genomics r&d to public funding . in  <dig>  an estimated us$ <dig>  billion was invested in genomics r&d by  <dig> genomics firms from  <dig> countries  <cit> . similar to the public funding of genomics research described here, top countries for private genomics firms are the united states, canada, germany, france, united kingdom, and japan  <cit> .

caveats
there are two major caveats to consider when interpreting the figures reported in this world survey. first, many organizations and countries are not included in this study, either because we did not know to contact them or because they did not respond. thus, the full amount of genomics research funded by public sources is certainly higher than the estimates reported in this study.

second, the values provided by each organization are estimates, according to each organization's own definition of genomics research, which is not uniform across all organizations. for example, organizations might have included some genetics research in their genomics research estimates. consider the nhgri and the cdc definition of genomics as "the study of all of " including "interactions of those genes with each other and the person's environment"  <cit> ). interestingly, another us government agency, the environmental protection agency, although not queried in this world survey, provides a definition of genomics, "the study of genes and their function"  <cit> , that is almost exactly the definition provided for genetics by the nhgri  <cit>  and in the literature . we note, however, that we only included values from organizations that were able to respond to our query for genomics research; organizations stating that they were not able to extract information from their funding databases for genomics research were not included.

CONCLUSIONS
although this survey is an estimate of funding for genomics research, and necessarily fuzzy and approximate, it represents the only attempt to perform such a survey to our knowledge, and therefore provides patterns and trends as a rough indicator for planning among researchers, science administrators, policymakers, and the general public.

this world survey would not have been possible had we tried to gather funding information for genomics research according to a strict and consistent definition. if governments and private funders believe that genomics as a funding category is permanent and worth retaining as a separate category for analysis, it will need a more uniform definition. this is particularly relevant for the nih, the world's largest biomedical research funder, which, except for two constituent institutes,  does not track funding of genomics research. and these two institutes report widely different figures for genomics as a fraction of genetics research, reflecting some real differences but probably also reflecting different definitions of genomics research. furthermore, the closest research category that the nih does track, genetics, is not defined centrally.

the nih is in the process of developing a "portfolio analysis" web-accessible tool that will allow the public to access information about nih projects by research area, the definitions of which will be "laboriously crafted with input from hundreds of scientists"  <cit> . the effort that is being expended to create this tool indicates the importance that the nih places upon appropriately categorizing public expenditures by research area. if genetics, genomics, or both are deemed important categories in which to monitor science trends and for budget planning, then it would be worthwhile to invest in a process to clarify definitions, and the nih's definition might well become a world standard.

the nci, a component of the nih, provided a definition of genomics: "the identification, characterization and quantification of all genes involved in a particular pathway, organelle, cell, tissue, organ or organism that can be studied in concert to provide accurate and comprehensive data about that system" . this is a detailed definition that encompasses and expands upon the definition of genomics already in use by the nhgri and the cdc . if the nih includes genomics as a research area in its new portfolio analysis tool, the nci definition could serve as a starting point for the development of a trans-nih definition of genomics research.

genomics research has become incorporated into scientific and medical research, and is beginning to be applied in medicine and commerce. genomics captures the attention of the general public because of its technological power to study the structure and function of dna, with the consequent potential to reveal intimate details about individuals, populations, and associations between genotype and phenotype.

the amount of funding provided for genomics research is of interest to both scientific and lay communities worldwide. this world survey indicates that overall public funding for genomics research, as a minimum estimate, averaged around us$ <dig>  billion annually . government and nonprofit funding of genomics research is likely to comprise between one-third and one-half of the total funding , based on the worldwide distribution of funding for health research .
