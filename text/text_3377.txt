BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle is a type of highly heterogeneous tissue that is traditionally divided into red  and white  fiber types
 <cit> . red skeletal muscles  can undertake chronic contractile activity without fatigue because they are better endowed with capillaries, myoglobin, lipids, and mitochondria than are white muscles 
 <cit> . to improve understanding of the major factors that determine the phenotypic properties of red and white muscles, previous studies have been performed at the mrna level. campbell et al. identified  <dig> differentially expressed mrna sequences using a microarray approach
 <cit> . bai et al. developed a porcine skeletal muscle cdna microarray and revealed numerous candidate genes involved in muscle phenotype determination
 <cit> . recently, transcriptional analysis between the red and white skeletal muscle of chinese meishan pigs revealed  <dig> signaling pathways including insulin signaling and a cell cycle pathway that responded to metabolic differences between muscle types
 <cit> . studies at the protein level have also revealed dissimilarities between the white and red skeletal muscle. white muscle was composed predominantly of glycolytic enzymes, whereas red muscle had a greater abundance of contractile proteins with higher oxidative enzyme content
 <cit> . gelfi et al. used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to build a reference map of proteins and identified hundreds of distinct gene products including metabolic, transport, and contractile proteins
 <cit> . moreover, it was reported that the different energetic demands of white and red muscles were matched primarily by the different numbers of mitochondrial proteins in the two tissues
 <cit> . recently, a number of studies have focused on small non-coding rnas, such as micrornas  and small interfering rnas , which are involved in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. nonetheless, how these small rnas are poised to perform different tasks in different muscle types has rarely been described.

mirnas are ubiquitously expressed non-coding small rnas of ~ <dig> nt in length. they are encoded by genes in the nucleus where mirna primary precursors  are formed. after processing with the drosha and dicer rnases, stem-loop precursor mirnas  are transcribed into mature mirnas
 <cit> . the 2– <dig> nucleotides at the 5′ end of a mirna are termed the functional ‘seed’ region for the recognition of target mrnas. the mirna is loaded into an rna-induced silencing complex, which decreases translation of the targeted gene product
 <cit> . mirnas have myriad roles in muscle biology and many are expressed in a tissue- and/or stage-specific manner
 <cit> . in  <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were reported to regulate the myostatin gene which directly impacts muscular hypertrophy
 <cit> . increasing evidence has shown that the mirnas can regulate the expression of transcription factors and signaling mediators for myopathies and muscular dystrophies
 <cit> . muscle-specific mir- <dig> and - <dig> are transcriptionally regulated by myogenic differentiation factors 
 <cit> , deletion of these mirnas resulted in aberrant muscle maintenance. a cluster of mirna species  were proposed to affect metabolic pathways by fine-tuning gene expression patterns
 <cit> . furthermore, mirnas also play important roles in myogenic differentiation
 <cit>  and development
 <cit> . nonetheless, little is known about the differentially expressed mirnas in white and red skeletal muscles.

pigs are of significant agricultural value and are considered an ideal model system for biomedical research
 <cit> . the application of deep sequencing has greatly accelerated the discovery of porcine mirnas
 <cit> . understanding differentially expressed mirnas in different muscle tissues will facilitate further identification of functional mirna biomarkers, which also are potential candidates for further improvement of meat quality and production using molecular approaches.

here, we studied the distinct porcine mirna expression patterns between the representative longissimus doris  and psoas major  muscles and investigated the roles of mirnas in regulating transcriptome networks involved in the two types of muscle fiber. our results extend the repertoire and understanding of porcine skeletal muscle mirnas.

RESULTS
phenotypic differences between the two distinct muscles
compared with the psoas major muscle , the longissimus doris muscle  exhibited a higher cross-sectional area, myofiber type rate, and toughness  , which suggests that there may be a disparity in the molecular mechanisms behind these differences.

summary of deep sequencing data
the sequencing of two small rna libraries from the ldm and pmm yielded  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m counts of sequenced sequences , respectively . of which,  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m ldm and pmm sequences, respectively, accounting for > 90% of the total sequ-seqs, were considered mappable sequences after filtering out the sequ-seqs that did not meet the accepted criteria. the statistics of the distribution of small rnas while applying a series of filters are given in additional file
2: table s <dig>  the reads  that mapped to certain other known classes of rna sequences  were eliminated from the analysis . the proportions of sequ-seqs that mapped to the other rna classes are listed in additional file
3: table s <dig>  there was a positive correlation between the expression level of the total counts of all isomirs and the most abundant sequence , thus, we used the most abundant sequence  and its count to represent a family of sequences that varies by length and/or by one nucleotide as previously report
 <cit> .

the size distribution of mappable sequences was similar in both libraries . the most abundant size class among the small rna sequences was the  <dig> nt rnas, accounting for  <dig>  m  and  <dig>  m , followed by the  <dig> and  <dig> nt rnas . this distribution is consistent with the typical 21– <dig> nt range for mirnas from dicer-derived products
 <cit> . notably, almost all of the other rnas in the ldm library had higher expression levels than the equivalent rnas in the pmm library, with the exception of the  <dig> nt rnas.

muscle-specific mirnas
as shown in table 
 <dig>  we divided the mappable reads into three groups  in order from high-to-mid confidence
 <cit> :  known porcine,  <dig> mirnas corresponding to  <dig> known porcine pre-mirnas that were also mapped to the pig genome. specifically,  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mirna*s are known in mirbase,  <dig> have not been identified and are novel ;  novel porcine,  <dig> mirnas corresponding to  <dig> other known mirbase mammalian  pre-mirnas that were mapped to the pig genome , this is in agreement with previous observations that many mirnas are conserved among species
 <cit> ; and  candidate porcine,  <dig> mirnas  encompassing  <dig> candidate pre-mirnas, with predicted rna hairpins derived from the pig genome .

mirbase  <dig>   documented  <dig> pre-mirnas encoding  <dig> known porcine mirnas. in this study, we found  <dig> and  <dig> known porcine mirnas in ldm and pmm, respectively, indicating that these two libraries encompass almost all of the known porcine mirnas. only  <dig> of the known mirnas were undetected in our data sets, likely because of extremely low or no expression in these two skeletal muscles.

notably,  <dig> of the  <dig> , and  <dig> of the  <dig>  known porcine mirnas, produced multiple mature variants from the reported mirnas in mirbase, probably because of the existence of isomirs expressed over a range of levels
 <cit> . it has been suggested that the most abundant isomirs may vary across tissues or developmental stages
 <cit> . here, the most frequently observed isomir was chosen as a reference sequence. in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig>  corresponding mirna*s were detected for the first time in this study. in most cases, the novel mirna*s were typically low in abundance when compared with the known mirnas, perhaps explaining why they have not been detected previously. low abundance mirnas frequently exhibit rapid turnover for biological regulation, and the detection of these novel mirnas demonstrates the high sensitivity of the deep sequencing method
 <cit> .

after the mappable reads were mapped to known porcine and/or other conserved mammalian mirnas, the remaining unmapped mappable reads were designated candidate porcine mirnas. based on a series of filters ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> pre-mirnas were predicted and the corresponding mirna*s of  <dig>  and  <dig>  were identified. intriguingly, about a quarter of these novel candidates mapped to two or more loci in the genome , this may be related to time- and space-specific expressions as described previously
 <cit> .

differentially expressed mirnas between ldm and pmm
we found that  <dig> of  <dig>  unique mirnas were co-expressed in the two libraries, and  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were specifically expressed in the ldm and pmm libraries, respectively, possible reflecting the physiological differences between these two distinct muscle types. since the tissue-specific mirnas accounted for less than  <dig> % of the total counts, we concentrated on the differentially expressed, relatively abundant mirnas in each library. to determine the significance of differences in the mirna counts in each library, the ideg <dig> program
 <cit>  was used for the normalization calculation between the mappable sequences in the two libraries. a unique mirna was considered to be differentially expressed when a fisher’s exact test produced p <  <dig> 
 <cit> . by applying this criterion, we identified  <dig> mirnas  that were differentially expressed between the pmm and ldm libraries , including  <dig> and  <dig> up- and down-regulated mirnas across the two libraries.

the known mirnas exhibited a very broad range of expression that varied from three to several hundreds of thousands of sequence reads, only a few the mirnas dominated the mirna abundances. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the top ten unique mirnas with the highest expression levels accounted for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total unique mirna counts. notably, mir- <dig> and -133a, the highly-characteristic muscle-specific mirnas, represented more than half of the total copy number for pmm and ldm, respectively. their very high abundance reflects the important regulatory role that they play in skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation
 <cit> , the genes containing the potential target sites are likely to be highly expressed in muscle tissue. mir-10b has also been observed in relatively high abundance in skeletal muscles
 <cit>  and, although little is known about its functional role in myoblast growth, an analysis of its target genes demonstrated that it was involved in myogenesis regulation and participates in muscle development regulation
 <cit> .

all of the top ten unique mirnas were co-expressed in both the pmm and ldm libraries but with different ranks. our results are consistent with previous studies that found that mir- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> frequently ranked among the highest expressed mirnas in porcine muscle cell proliferation and differentiation
 <cit> . the let-7a and -7f mirnas were ubiquitously expressed in both tissues and accounted for over  <dig> % of the total reads. four of the top ten mirnas, mir- <dig>  -148a, - <dig>  and -27b, were up-regulated  in pmm compared with ldm; however, there have been no reports documenting their possible in vivo/vitro roles in muscle development. therefore, we carried out a prediction analysis for the target genes of these four differentially expressed mirnas using three prediction programs, pictar
 <cit> , targetscan
 <cit> , and mirna-target gene prediction at embl
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> target genes corresponding to  <dig> unique mrna-mirna interactions were predicted by combing the results from the three programs. the subsequent david gene annotation analysis
 <cit>  of the predicted target genes indicated that the most enriched go terms included transcription regulation, macromolecule biosynthetic processes, cellular protein metabolic processes, muscle cell differentiation, and skeletal muscle development . according to the kegg pathway annotation of their putative target protein coding genes , focal adhesion and the mapk, wnt, and mtor signaling pathways were identified as the global changes between porcine red  and white  muscles. interestingly, the enriched ecm-receptor interaction is reportedly associated with meat tenderness and texture
 <cit> . our data also highlighted pathways related to cancer, indicating that the genes expressed in cell proliferation and differentiation were targeted by other mirnas. in summary, the annotations for the predicted targets indicate that different metabolic patterns are regulated by mirnas between porcine pmm and ldm muscles. further investigation is required to better understand the influence of mirnas on the phenotypes of the various muscle fiber types.

our results demonstrate that differential metabolic mechanisms may drive the development of the two muscle types in the direction of their individual functions. we identified several mirnas that participate in muscle metabolic pathways and showed that these exhibit significant differences between the pmm and lcm libraries . both mir- <dig> and - <dig> promote mammalian myoblast differentiation and development
 <cit> , and it has been speculated that mir- <dig> plays a role in inducing antioxidant response in skeletal muscle
 <cit> . our finding that mir- <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of the detected mirnas in our ldm library is consistent with previous results. others have reported that mir-133a enhances myocyte proliferation by reducing protein levels of srf and inhibits polypyrimidine tract-binding protein  translation; both of these proteins are crucial regulators for muscle differentiation
 <cit> . mir- <dig> was barely detectable in resting muscle cells
 <cit>  and mir- <dig> was only highly expressed in newly formed muscle fibers
 <cit> . this may explain why they were present in relatively low abundance in adult skeletal muscles compared with the high abundance of the muscle-specific mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in this study. the pmm and ldm libraries showed similar expression levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  both of which have been predicted in the pathways that involve cellular acetyl-coa and lipid levels
 <cit> . the pgc1α gene is known to be a reliable target of mir-23
 <cit> , which increases the mitochondrial content of mouse skeletal muscle
 <cit> . a previous study has shown that exercise-induced pgc1α usually led to the generation of more oxidative red muscle than oxidative white muscle fibers
 <cit> . in our study, both the sequencing and microarray profiling results revealed that the ldm library possessed a slightly higher abundance of mir- <dig> than the pmm library , which might lead to relatively lower expression of pgc1α in ldm. the differences between the two muscle types are mainly determined by the relative ratio of muscle fibers, mir- <dig> and its target pgc1α are just one of the complex components of the metabolic mechanisms that are involved. in summary, we tentatively conclude that the differentially expressed mirnas between the two libraries contribute in a major way to the development of skeletal muscles in the respective directions required for them to carry out their functions.

microarray validation
to further validate the deep sequencing results, microarrays to investigate the relative expression levels of the mirnas in both libraries were performed. first, the three biological replicates were highly correlated with each other , suggesting experimental reliability and making it possible to pool the samples during the sequencing process in case of individual differences. second, we correlated the microarray and deep sequencing results. as a result,  <dig> unique mirnas including  <dig> known porcine mirnas were detected and  <dig> of  <dig> mirnas were the same as the sequ-seqs. for the known mirnas, the pearson’s correlation between the microarray profiling and sequencing results was  <dig>  . the top ten expressed mirnas also showed strong signals in the microarrays, with the exception of mir- <dig>  pearson’s correlation was  <dig>  . microarray profiling identified mir-26a as being highly expressed in both libraries, however, this highly expressed mirna was not identified by sequencing. these differences may derive from the intrinsic differences between these two approaches
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study has indicated the essential roles that mirnas play in different muscle fiber types and should make studies of the muscle-specific regulation involving mirnas possible.
