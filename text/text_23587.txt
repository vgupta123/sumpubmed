BACKGROUND
whole genome duplications followed by differentiation of many gene duplicates in the ancestors of rainbow trout and other salmonid fishes  <cit>  have created one of the most complex animal genomes  <cit> . historical polyploid events have also been important in the ancestry of all vertebrates  <cit> , and are of broad significance in plant evolution  <cit> . genome duplications increase the complexity of genomic studies  <cit>  and result in a need to distinguish between paralogs  <cit> . population and quantitative genetics fundamentally rely on the accurate identification of the alleles of a gene or locus  <cit> .

identification of alleles is complicated when paralogous genes or sequences are easily mistaken for alleles  <cit> . recent analytical methods have increasingly turned to single nucleotide polymorphisms  as the preferred genetic marker to distinguish between alleles because they are ubiquitous and can be readily scored  <cit> . snps are easily mistaken for paralogous sequence variants because many paralogs are similar in sequence and may contain common variants that were present before genome duplication.

traditional snp calling programs use sequence alignments of cdna or genomic sequence and identify any variant position as a possible snp  <cit> . if a paralog is included in the alignment, traditional strategies will incorrectly identify paralogous sequence variants as possible snps . traditional approaches of transcriptome data analysis for snp identification have been utilized for both diploid and polyploid organisms  <cit> .

in the diploid carrot, 18% of the potential snps were found to be false-positives  using a traditional method of analyzing transcriptomic data  <cit> , and in some fish species the false-positive rate was very high   <cit> . in fishes with polyploid ancestries, the false-positive rate was  <dig> % for whitefish  <cit> , and  <dig> % for chum salmon  <cit> .

two main non-traditional approaches have been used to distinguish snps from paralogous sequence variants. the most common strategy has been to remove all polymorphisms associated with genes that have paralogs  <cit> . such filtering drastically reduces the total number of genes in which polymorphisms can be detected in species with recent polyploidy ancestries and may still lead to a relatively high false-positive rate. a filtering strategy was used for a diploid coral transcriptomic dataset, which resulted in a 30% false-positive rate  <cit>  and a 12% false-positive rate was found for ryegrass using a similar strategy  <cit> . in polyploid alfalfa, a window approach was used to eliminate snps if the potential alleles differed by 10% or more in the window surrounding the snp  <cit> . this resulted in a false-positive rate of  <dig> %, a very positive outcome considering that the alfalfa was both polyploid and had heterozygous genotypes. in salmonids, filtering resulted in a false-positive rate of  <dig> %  <cit> .

other researchers have proposed strategies to detect polymorphisms without filtering paralogs  <cit> . these methods allow identification of differences between alleles in genes with paralogs, but alleles will still be indistinguishable from paralogs in future studies if the sequence is not reported with the snp. knowledge of a snp at a given location is not fully informative as paralogs may share common sequence with an allele.

the snp calling method described here involves the analysis of windows of sequence  and only comparing homozygous alleles differing between individuals . we utilized homozygous clonal lines of rainbow trout because they ensure homozygous alleles at every locus and any difference within an individual likely represents a paralogous sequence variant. this strategy may also be used for snp identification in outbred organisms, but only snps from homozygous loci will be identified.

RESULTS
cdna output, snp calling, and paralog counting
embryo and head kidney cdna were sequenced for five homozygous clonal lines of rainbow trout. the average number of reads per clonal line was  <dig>   for the embryo and  <dig>   for the head kidney . cdna reads were aligned to the unique rainbow trout unigene database  with megablast version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and with novoalign version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to compare these two alignment programs.

for each unigene sequence, the aligned cdna reads were used to estimate the number of paralogs and identify potential snps for both tissues . figure  <dig> shows the distribution of different categories of gene duplication for the different tissues and the combined result. snps were identified in  <dig>  of the unigene reference sequences and  <dig>   total snps were found when both tissues and all the clonal lines were combined . for novoalign alignments, snps were found in  <dig>  references, with  <dig>  total snps identified. the number of snps detected between clonal lines of rainbow trout ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> .

the number of single and multiple copy unigenes was estimated using the reads from all clones from the different tissues . unigenes without sufficient evidence of copy number are not represented. the snp counts were found by comparing all clones against each other at the same time. these snps have a snp score of  <dig>  or greater, meaning that all of them have more than a single read representing each allele. the first set of numbers are from novoalign alignments and the second set are from megablast .

the number of snps with snp scores of  <dig>  or greater using sequences from both embryo and head kidney tissues between the clonal lines of rainbow trout. the alignments, used to identify these snps, were produced using novoalign with default settings  and megablast .

the number of snps between lines appears to be correlated with number of reads, with the lines having higher read counts also having more snps . a value of  <dig>  for the snp score was used as a threshold for reporting based on table  <dig> , and because an allele only represented by one read would score below this value . removing these alleles should remove most sequencing errors. the embryo and head kidney tissues had the same gene counts for roughly half of the overlapping unigenes  when using megablast alignments and 72%  using novoalign alignments.

the number of snps from the original study and from different settings using our strategy. there are multiple numbers per parameter explored. these reflect different alignment programs used under these settings. the first set of numbers were from novoalign alignments, and the second were from megablast .

the different snp numbers and percent gene duplication , identified while using different alignment programs resulted from how alignments were produced. novoalign uses a global alignment algorithm and produced fewer alignments between diverged paralogs . the novoalign program produces relatively few alignments with lower sequence identity compared to the megablast program. the megablast result is similar to an all-against-all est comparison from atlantic salmon with greater divergence between ancestral genomes in the rainbow trout  <cit> .

in a general sense, having few low sequence identity alignments indicates that the novoalign program is more accurate because diverged paralogs are not aligning to the reference sequences. however, our strategy requires the alignment of paralogs so we can distinguish between these sequences and identify snps in paralogs that are not represented in the reference sequences.

snp validation
we downloaded cdna and reference sequences used by another research group to identify snps in polyploid wheat  <cit> . we applied our strategy for snp discovery to these previously validated unigenes, allowing for direct comparison of validation rates . variation in window size can produce differing results . larger window sizes produced fewer false-positives , and adopting a snp score threshold of  <dig>  eliminated all false-positives. the false-positive rate varied by alignment program, but in all instances the false-positive rate was lower using the strategy described here than was observed in the original study .

there was little variance in snp validation when comparing different alignment programs. during snp identification in rainbow trout, nearly twice as many snps were identified when megablast was used. in wheat, snp identification is virtually the same between alignment programs. it appears from the  <dig> gene dataset that the genome duplication event was much more recent in wheat than in rainbow trout. for this reason both alignment programs were able to align the highly similar paralogs with similar performance . it is believed that there was an allopolyploid event in tetraploid wheat less than  <dig>  mya  <cit> , which corresponds to highly similar paralogous sequence seen in this dataset.

sequencing validation
for snp validation ten sets of primers were also created to amplify genomic dna of the different trout lines of ten predicted snps in sequences downloaded from ncbi. five of these pairs amplified well and were polymorphic at the predicted site when sequenced. the low amplification rate is attributed to the lack of information related to repetitive sequences and introns surrounding the window in which a snp was predicted . the five that amplified well had scores of:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the others had scores of:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

discussion
traditional methods of snp identification are effective for standard diploid organisms, but are not appropriate for organisms that have had a genome duplication. other methods have been employed to overcome traditional limitations  <cit> , but they may be of limited use for future studies if they cannot effectively integrate the occurrence of paralogs into snp identification. our strategy incorporates such information during snp calling and may be used for both inbred lines and outbred populations.

the importance of alignment program selection increases as paralogs diverge. early after a genome duplication, it is likely that most alignment programs could effectively align paralogous sequences together. as mutations alter the paralog sequences, high stringency alignment programs will no longer align paralogs together. snp discovery in diploids benefits from accurate alignments, but information about the paralogs is much more valuable in polyploids than highly precise alignments.

dependence on a nucleotide window is both a weakness and strength of this strategy. while modifications may be made to increase or decrease the window size, doing so may also influence the results. for example, a decreased window size may limit the ability to distinguish similar paralogs . alternatively, an increased window size would allow the identification of all non-identical paralogs, but would decrease the likelihood that a cdna sequence would span the window completely and would decrease the amount of usable data. traditional strategies have an effective window size of one nucleotide and for this reason are unable to differentiate between paralogs.

one distinctive component of our strategy is the stringent use of only homozygous alleles in snp identification. this eliminates many false-positive snps that are the result of paralogous sequence variants. at the same time, fewer snps will be found because heterozygous alleles are eliminated during snp identification. to maximize snp identification, it may be more appropriate to use a low stringency method and use allele frequency as a filter instead of the homozygous selection method described here.

a complementary application of this method might be in the identification of gene families or paralogs. our method tries to identify paralogs from short cdna sequences in order to score snps, but the estimation may be useful in other ways. for example, the described strategy may be used as an initial method for identifying genes that may be duplicated. identification and enumeration of paralogs would benefit gene expression, phylogenetic, and gene ontology studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the snp validation evidence suggests that our method offers an advantage over existing strategies of snp identification for polyploid organisms. this strategy might also be used for analyzing data derived from diploid organisms, but would likely be overly conservative for snp identification in those organisms, resulting in identification of fewer snps.
