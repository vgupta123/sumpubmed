BACKGROUND
as the largest insulin-sensitive tissue in the body, skeletal muscle plays a vital role in maintaining glucose homeostasis via the uptake, storage and oxidation of carbohydrate during the postprandial period. under fasting conditions, however, fatty acid  oxidation dominates to satisfy muscle energy needs whilst sparing glucose and protecting muscle glycogen reserves  <cit> . such flexibility in fuel selection is a hallmark of metabolically-healthy muscle; indeed, in human muscle, insulin sensitivity relates strongly to a capacity to increase fa oxidation in the presence of fat  <cit> . furthermore, the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation  <cit>  and fa oxidation  <cit>  are downregulated in diabetic muscle. the atypical accumulation of intramyocellular lipids, possibly resulting from impaired fa oxidation, has been associated with the aetiology of insulin resistance  <cit> .

promotion of muscle fa oxidation thus emerged as a strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance  <cit> , with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  transcription factors representing key targets  <cit> . pparα is expressed in liver, heart and skeletal muscle, and when activated increases the expression of fa oxidation genes  <cit> . meanwhile, pparβ/δ is ubiquitously expressed, abundantly present in skeletal muscle  <cit>  and, when stimulated, can reduce obesity and improve insulin sensitivity  <cit> . in high-fat feeding models, however, enhanced ppar target gene expression was associated with increased rates of incomplete fa oxidation and intra-mitochondrial accumulation of potentially harmful intermediates, e.g. acyl-coas and acyl-carnitines  <cit> . indeed, in mice lacking malonyl-coa decarboxylase , decreased mitochondrial fa import and catabolism were associated with protection against glucose intolerance  <cit> .

the concept of mitochondrial overload was thus proposed, in which increased lipid supply and β-oxidation is not accompanied by sufficient tricarboxylic acid cycle activity to support complete fa oxidation  <cit> . pparγ co-activator 1α , a transcriptional co-regulator that interacts with the ppars, is considered the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . increased pgc-1α expression following exercise-training prevented lipid-overload-induced mitochondrial deficiency associated with high-fat feeding, lowering muscle concentrations of long-chain acyl-carnitines  <cit> .

recently, a role has emerged for cyclic guanosine monophosphate  in regulating energy metabolism  <cit> . in muscle, cgmp stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and fa oxidation  <cit> , whilst in white adipose tissue , cgmp, acting via cgmp-dependent protein kinases  promoted the browning response characterised by increased mitochondrial density and uncoupling protein  <dig>  expression  <cit> .

dietary nitrate increases plasma cgmp in humans  <cit> , whilst nitrite increased cgmp levels in some tissues  <cit> . nitrate reversed features of metabolic syndrome in enos−/− mice, including a reduction in body fat and improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity  <cit> . recently, we showed that inorganic nitrate promoted the browning of wat via activation of soluble guanylate cyclase   <cit> . moreover, we found that nitrate prevented the downregulation of fa oxidation in the hypoxic rat heart  <cit> . the hypoxic suppression of fa oxidation is commonly seen in both human and rodent skeletal muscle  <cit>  as well as rat heart  <cit> , and may result from the hypoxia-inducible factor -dependent suppression of pparα transcriptional activity and/or expression, as seen in some tissues  <cit> . fa oxidation requires more o <dig> than glucose oxidation  and thus this mechanism may spare o <dig> in hypoxic tissues. the preservation of fa oxidation in the hypoxic heart following nitrate supplementation may be an indirect effect arising from improvements in blood flow and therefore tissue oxygenation, but notably nitrate also increased the fa oxidation capacity of cardiac mitochondria in normoxic rats  <cit> , perhaps suggesting a direct effect on metabolic regulation.

we therefore investigated the possible effects of dietary nitrate on fa oxidation in skeletal muscle, hypothesising that nitrate would enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and β-oxidation. we found that nitrate enhances skeletal muscle fa oxidation in rodents in a dose-dependent manner. nitrate induces fa oxidation through a sgc/cgmp-mediated pparβ/δ- and pparα-dependent mechanism. enhanced pparβ/δ and pparα expression and dna-binding induces expression of fa oxidation enzymes, increasing muscle carnitine and lowering tissue malonyl-coa concentrations, thereby supporting intra-mitochondrial pathways of fa oxidation and enhancing mitochondrial respiration. at higher doses, nitrate also induces mitochondrial biogenesis, further increasing fa oxidation and lowering long-chain fa concentrations.

RESULTS
dietary nitrate counteracts the hypoxic suppression of pgc-1α in skeletal muscle and enhances fa oxidation in both normoxic and hypoxic skeletal muscle
since nitrate supplementation prevented the hypoxic suppression of fa oxidation in rat cardiac muscle  <cit> , we investigated whether nitrate was similarly protective in the skeletal muscle of rats exposed to hypoxic conditions  for 14 days compared with rats housed in a normoxic environment. rats were supplemented with either  <dig>  mm sodium nitrate or  <dig>  mm sodium chloride  via their drinking water and maintained on a standardized quality-controlled  diet to normalize micronutrient intake. nitrate concentrations of food and water were known, thus facilitating calculation of nitrate intake. no differences were observed in food intake or volumes of water consumed between any of the groups . as shown previously, consumption of nitrate-supplemented water, increased nitrate intake by 5- to 7-fold compared with sodium chloride controls  <cit> .

nitrate supplementation increased plasma nitrate concentrations in both normoxic and hypoxic rats, as shown previously  <cit> , with no change in nitrite concentrations. in soleus muscle, hypoxia decreased total nox, and this was unaffected by dietary nitrate supplementation .fig.  <dig> dietary nitrate counteracts the hypoxic suppression of pgc-1α in skeletal muscle and enhances fatty acid oxidation in both normoxic and hypoxic skeletal muscle.  soleus total nitrogen oxide levels ;  fatty acid profile of soleus tissue divided into ≥ c <dig>  and < c <dig> ;  carnitine and acyl-carnitine profile of soleus;  respiration rates and respiratory control ratios with palmitoyl-carnitine and malate substrates in permeabilized soleus muscle fibres;  3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase activity in soleus tissue;  malonyl-coa levels in soleus tissue extracts;  citrate synthase and pgc-1α protein levels in soleus tissue;  amp, adp and atp levels in soleus tissue extracts. data are represented as mean ± sem, n = 4– <dig> per experimental group. * p ≤ <dig> ; ** p ≤ <dig> ; *** p ≤ <dig> 



to understand whether nitrate supplementation altered fa oxidation in vivo, we measured total fa concentrations  in whole skeletal muscle, and found that shorter-chain fas  were the same in all groups, whilst longer-chain fas  decreased by 38 % upon nitrate supplementation, but increased by 34 % with hypoxic exposure . in nitrate-supplemented hypoxic rats, longer-chain fas decreased by 37 % compared with non-supplemented hypoxic rats , and were comparable with normoxic rats receiving sodium chloride in their water.

next, we measured carnitine and acyl-carnitine concentrations in the muscle of these rats. total acyl-carnitine levels were the same in all groups. however, the concentration of free carnitine was increased by 54 % following nitrate supplementation, whether in normoxic or hypoxic rats, whilst hypoxia alone did not alter carnitine concentrations . in humans, carnitine loading supports enhanced muscle fa oxidation, preventing body fat accumulation  <cit> . an increased ratio of long chain acyl-carnitines to free carnitine has been described in the hypoxic rat heart in association with decreased β-oxidation  <cit> , whilst oram et al.  <cit>  speculated that high intracellular concentrations of free carnitine  may be important for selectively channelling fat for oxidation rather than lipid biosynthesis.

to understand how hypoxia/nitrate affected the capacity of skeletal muscle mitochondria for fa oxidation, respiration rates were measured in permeabilized soleus muscle fibre bundles with a fatty acyl-carnitine substrate . leak state respiration  appeared to be unaffected by either hypoxia or nitrate alone. however, nitrate supplementation in hypoxia resulted in leak state fa respiration rates that were 64 % higher than in normoxic/chloride rats . in contrast to our previous finding in heart  <cit> , soleus oxphos state fa respiration rates were unaffected by hypoxia alone; however, in both normoxic and hypoxic rats, nitrate supplementation resulted in oxphos state fa respiration rates that were 90 % and 81 % higher, respectively, than in chloride-supplemented controls .

we therefore investigated two aspects of mitochondrial fa metabolism, namely activity of the β-oxidation enzyme, 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase , and tissue concentrations of malonyl-coa, a negative regulator of mitochondrial fa import via its inhibitory effects on the carnitine palmitoyl-transferase  system. whilst hypoxia did not affect either of these markers, nitrate supplementation increased hoad activity in normoxic rats  and lowered tissue malonyl-coa concentrations in both normoxic and hypoxic rats .

in addition to this, we aimed to understand whether the enhanced fa oxidation capacity following nitrate supplementation could be explained by changes in mitochondrial density. protein levels of citrate synthase, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme and marker of mitochondrial density, were not significantly altered by either hypoxia or nitrate, although there was a trend towards decreased levels in hypoxia that was prevented by nitrate, and a trend towards increased levels in normoxic rats with nitrate supplementation. levels of pgc-1α, however, were 60 % lower in hypoxic muscle compared with that of chloride-supplemented normoxic animals and this was prevented by nitrate supplementation . interestingly, pgc-1α levels were 50 % higher in the muscle of nitrate-supplemented normoxic rats compared with control animals . thus, although the changes in pgc-1α were not associated with significant changes in citrate synthase activity, our findings nevertheless suggested that nitrate may exert effects on mitochondrial biogenesis via pgc-1α, and that this might become apparent with higher doses of nitrate.

finally, to understand the energetic implications of these changes, we measured amp, adp and atp levels in the soleus of these rats. hypoxic exposure decreased atp and increased amp levels, indicating impaired energetics, whilst nitrate supplementation prevented this .

dietary nitrate enhances fa oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in the skeletal muscle of normoxic animals in a dose-dependent manner
since nitrate supplementation was found to enhance fa oxidation in normoxic skeletal muscle, we focused on normoxic rats alone in order to establish whether the different effects observed on mitochondrial biogenesis and fa oxidation are dose dependent. rats received the same sqc diet as before and water supplemented with 0 mm ,  <dig>  mm ,  <dig>  mm , and  <dig>  mm  sodium nitrate. as such, the medium dose group was equivalent to that received by the nitrate-supplemented normoxic group in the hypoxia study. nitrate supplementation did not affect food or water intake, and body weight was unaffected . nitrate intake increased dose-dependently across the groups , as did plasma nitrate levels; however, plasma nitrite levels only increased in the high dose group, as shown previously  <cit> .table  <dig> the effects of 18 days supplementation with low , medium  and high  doses of dietary nitrate on food, water and nitrate intakes, and body weight in rats, data = mean ± sem, n = 5– <dig> per group



next, we measured total fa concentrations in whole skeletal muscle, and found that shorter-chain fas were the same in all groups, whilst longer-chain fas  decreased dose-dependently with nitrate supplementation , suggesting that nitrate increased fa catabolism in a dose-dependent manner. correspondingly, oxygen consumption of permeabilized soleus muscle fibres with  <dig>  mm palmitoyl-carnitine and 5 mm malate also increased with nitrate supplementation , with leak state respiration increasing dose-dependently, yet oxphos respiration peaking at the medium dose  and remaining elevated at the high dose.fig.  <dig> dietary nitrate enhances fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.  fatty acid profile of soleus tissue divided into ≥ c <dig>  and < c <dig> ;  respiration rates with palmitoyl-carnitine and malate substrates in permeabilized soleus muscle fibres;  citrate synthase activity in soleus tissue;  14c-palmitate oxidation rates in mitochondrial isolates from soleus muscle;  3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase activity in soleus tissue;  cpt <dig> activity in mitochondrial isolates from soleus muscle;  malonyl-coa levels in soleus tissue extracts;  malonyl-coa decarboxylase protein levels in soleus tissue. data are represented as mean ± sem, n = 4– <dig> per experimental group. * p ≤ <dig> ; ** p ≤ <dig> ; *** p ≤ <dig> 



to understand whether these effects might be attributed to changes in mitochondrial density or intra-mitochondrial changes, we measured citrate synthase and hoad activities in whole skeletal muscle lysates from these rats. citrate synthase  activity was not altered by the low or medium doses of nitrate, but was  <dig> -fold higher in rats receiving high-dose nitrate supplementation compared with controls . meanwhile, hoad activity showed a similar pattern, with no effect of low or medium doses of nitrate supplementation, but 86 % higher activity at the highest dose of nitrate . thus, whilst the effects of high-dose nitrate supplementation might be attributed, at least in part, to mitochondrial biogenesis, it appears that at lower doses there is nevertheless an enhanced capacity for fa oxidation which is driven by intra-mitochondrial changes.

therefore we further investigated the nitrate-enhanced fa oxidation in mitochondrial isolates using 14c-palmitate oxidation and cpt <dig> activity. 14c-palmitate oxidation per unit of mitochondrial protein was increased by nitrate supplementation, though this only reached statistical significance at the highest dose of nitrate . cpt <dig> activity, however, was increased by low and medium doses of nitrate, peaking at the lowest dose of nitrate used here and not reaching statistical significance at the highest dose . tissue levels of malonyl-coa, a negative regulator of cpt <dig>  were decreased by 60–70 % at all doses of nitrate . this appeared to be due to an upregulation of mcd, since protein levels of mcd were elevated by nitrate supplementation in a similar fashion to cpt <dig> activity and were inversely related to tissue malonyl-coa, peaking in the skeletal muscle of the low-dose-supplemented group and failing to reach significance at the higher dose .

dietary nitrate enhances fa oxidation in skeletal muscle via enhanced pparα and pparβ/δ transcriptional activity
thus far, our data suggested that nitrate exerts dose-dependent effects on skeletal muscle fa oxidation, with intra-mitochondrial effects predominating at lower doses, including a release of inhibition on mitochondrial fa import via the cpt system, and a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis at higher doses. we next sought to investigate the downstream signalling/effector pathways mediating these nitrate-induced effects.

no, a putative product of nitrate reduction, is known to increase levels of the secondary messenger cgmp in tissue; therefore, we first measured cgmp and camp levels in the soleus of the rats. we found that nitrate elevated cgmp in a dose-dependent manner, whereas camp was unaffected by nitrate at any dose .fig.  <dig> dietary nitrate enhances fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle via enhanced pparα and pparβ/δ activity.  levels of camp and cgmp in soleus extracts from rats supplemented with control , low , medium  and high  doses of dietary nitrate;  pparα and pparβ/δ expression in soleus tissue;  pparα and pparβ/δ dna-binding in nuclear extracts of soleus;  respiration rates and respiratory control ratio with palmitoyl-carnitine and malate substrates in permeabilized soleus muscle fibres from wild-type and pparα−/− mice;  pparα and pparβ/δ dna-binding in nuclear extracts of soleus from wild-type mice and pparα−/− mice. data are represented as mean ± sem, n = 3– <dig> per experimental group. * p ≤ <dig> ; ** p ≤ <dig> ; *** p ≤ <dig> 



since cgmp activates ppar signalling  <cit>  and many fa oxidation enzymes and regulators are transcriptional targets of pparα and pparβ/δ, we investigated the mechanism of these dose-dependent effects, focusing on ppar-driven transcription. the expression of pparα and pparβ/δ in the soleus of rats supplemented with nitrate was analysed. we found that pparα levels increased dose-dependently with nitrate supplementation, being  <dig> -fold higher in the soleus of high-dose rats, compared with controls. expression of pparβ/δ was also increased with nitrate supplementation but peaked at the low dose, and was not significantly elevated in the soleus of high-dose rats . correspondingly, pparα dna-binding activity increased dose-dependently with nitrate, whilst that of pparβ/δ was enhanced by nitrate but peaked at the lowest dose . it therefore appears that the dose-dependence of the effects we previously observed relate to the divergent downstream effects of the different ppar isoforms.

to further confirm that the effects of nitrate occur via pparα activation, we switched our attention to pparα−/− mice, which, along with wild-type controls, were supplemented with  <dig>  mm sodium nitrate  for 14 days. in agreement with studies in rats, we found that nitrate increased palmitoyl-carnitine respiration in the oxphos state by 38 % in wild-type mice. in pparα−/− mice, palmitoyl-carnitine respiration was lower than in wild-type mice, as expected, and was not affected by nitrate supplementation . nitrate increased pparα dna-binding activity in wild-type mice, but pparβ/δ dna-binding activity did not increase in pparα−/− or wild-type mice with nitrate supplementation .

nitrate enhances fa oxidation capacity via no-cgmp-pkg in c2c <dig> myotubes
our data therefore suggested a role for enhanced pparα transcriptional activity in the effects that nitrate exerts on fa oxidation. we hypothesized that this might occur via no activation of sgc, leading to elevation of cgmp and hence downstream activation of pkg. we therefore sought to test this proposed mechanism in c2c <dig> myoblasts exposed to different concentrations of sodium nitrate.

following induction of differentiation, cells expressed muscle differentiation markers  after 6 days , and this was unaffected by any of the experimental conditions we later used; i.e. supplementation with nitrate alone at either  <dig> or 500 μm  or nitrate in the presence of inhibitors for sgc or pkg . nitrate supplementation at 50 μm did not alter leak state respiration in digitonin-permeabilized cells in the presence of palmitoyl-carnitine ; however, this rate was enhanced by 500 μm nitrate – an effect prevented by both sgc and pkg inhibition . oxphos state respiration was also unaffected by 50 μm nitrate; however, both sgc and pkg inhibition decreased this respiration rate in c2c <dig> cells, whether supplemented with nitrate or not . at 500 μm, nitrate did enhance palmitoyl-carnitine respiration in the oxphos state  – an effect abrogated by sgc and pkg inhibition.fig.  <dig> nitrate enhances fatty acid oxidation capacity via no-cgmp-pkg in c2c <dig> myotubes.  muscle differentiation marker expression in c2c <dig> myoblasts cultured and differentiated over 6 days;  muscle differentiation marker expression in c2c <dig> myocytes cultured and differentiated over 6 days in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> and 500 μm nitrate. see also additional file 1: figure s <dig>  leak state respiration of palmitoyl-carnitine and malate substrates in permeabilized c2c <dig> myotubes cultured and differentiated over 6 days in the presence of   <dig> or 50 μm nitrate or   <dig> or 500 μm nitrate, in the presence or absence of sgci  or pkgi . oxphos state respiration of palmitoyl-carnitine and malate substrates in permeabilized c2c <dig> myotubes cultured and differentiated over 6 days in the presence of   <dig> or 50 μm nitrate or   <dig> or 500 μm nitrate, in the presence or absence of sgci  or pkgi . data are represented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig> repeats per condition. * p ≤ <dig> ; ** p ≤ <dig> ; *** p ≤ <dig> 



we proceeded to investigate the effects of nitrate supplementation on the expression of fa oxidation enzymes and other mitochondrial proteins in c2c <dig> cells. we found that expression of cpt1b, acadl and hadh , was enhanced by 500 μm, but not 50 μm, nitrate supplementation , as was the expression of ucp <dig> and cycs , whilst expression of the complex i subunit ndufs <dig> was enhanced at both  <dig> and 500 μm nitrate . the effects of nitrate were time-dependent, reaching significance after 6 days of differentiation . notably, inhibition of sgc  and pkg  abolished all of these effects, confirming that the mechanism underlying the effects of nitrate on enhanced ppar expression and transcriptional activity are mediated via the no-cgmp-pkg signalling pathway.fig.  <dig> nitrate enhances the expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes and other mitochondrial proteins via no-cgmp-pkg in c2c <dig> myotubes.  cpt1b, acad <dig> and hadh, and  ucp <dig>  cycs and ndufs <dig> expression in c2c <dig> myotubes cultured and differentiated over 6 days in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> and 500 μm nitrate,  in the presence and absence of sgci , and  in the presence and absence of pkgi . data are represented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig> repeats per condition. * p ≤ <dig> ; ** p ≤ <dig> ; *** p ≤ <dig> 



to further confirm the role of cgmp in mediating the effect of nitrate on fa oxidation, we treated c2c <dig> cells with 500 μm nitrate and/or 1 μm of the cgmp-specific phosphodiesterase  <dig> inhibitor, sildenafil, which prevents cgmp breakdown. as before, 500 μm nitrate increased expression of ucp <dig>  acadl and cpt1b, and a similar increase in expression of all three targets was seen with 1 μm sildenafil alone . as expected, 500 μm nitrate and 1 μm sildenafil in combination, acting to both increase cgmp production and decrease cgmp breakdown, produced a greater increase in expression of all three targets than either treatment alone .fig.  <dig> nitrate and sildenafil cumulatively increase the expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes and other mitochondrial proteins, and increase cpt1b protein levels.  ucp <dig>  acad <dig> and cpt1b expression in c2c <dig> myotubes differentiated in the presence of 500 μm nitrate, 1 μm sildenafil, or both nitrate and sildenafil in combination.  cpt1b protein levels in c2c <dig> cells exposed to 500 μm nitrate, 1 μm sildenafil, nitrate and sildenafil in combination, 1 μm odq, and nitrate and odq in combination. data are represented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig> repeats per condition. * p ≤ <dig> ; ** p ≤ <dig> ; *** p ≤ <dig> 



finally, we set out to confirm that the changes in cpt1b expression were reflected at the protein level. both 500 μm nitrate and 1 μm sildenafil increased cpt1b protein concentration in c2c <dig> cells, with a greater increase in cpt1b seen when nitrate and sildenafil were administered in combination . meanwhile, treatment with the sgc inhibitor, 1h- <cit> oxadiazoloquinoxalin-1-one , prevented the effect of nitrate on cpt1b concentration .

discussion
herein, we report that moderate doses of dietary inorganic nitrate increase the capacity for fa oxidation in skeletal muscle. the mechanism is dose-dependent, with increased expression and transcriptional activity of pparβ/δ and pparα occurring at lower nitrate concentrations, upregulating intra-mitochondrial pathways of fa oxidation, relieving inhibition of the cpt shuttle by malonyl-coa via the upregulation of mcd, and increasing muscle carnitine concentrations. notably, the same doses of nitrate did not increase fa oxidation in the muscle of pparα−/− mice. increased mitochondrial volume density was observed at the highest dose of nitrate used in this study, supporting the capacity of muscle for complete fa oxidation. the underlying mechanism involves enhanced no bioavailability, which activates sgc to increase muscle cgmp concentrations, subsequently activating pkg and leading to pparα and  pgc-1α upregulation . indeed, in myocytes, inhibition of sgc or pkg prevented the nitrate-driven upregulation of pparα-target genes and other mitochondrial proteins.fig.  <dig> schematic outlining the proposed mechanism underlying the effect of dietary nitrate on fatty acid  oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. nitrate  is sequentially reduced to nitrite  and nitric oxide , which activates soluble guanylate cyclase. thus, nitrate dose-dependently increases cellular cgmp, activating protein kinase g. at low doses of nitrate, pparβ/δ levels increase, increasing expression of cpt <dig> and lowering malonyl-coa, increasing fa oxidation. at intermediate doses of nitrate, induction of pparα augments these changes and increases carnitine levels, further increasing fa oxidation. meanwhile, pparβ/δ expression is repressed by pparα activation. at higher doses, increased expression of 3-hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase occurs alongside elevated citrate synthase, indicating mitochondrial biogenesis, which further enhances muscle capacity for fa oxidation



the excellent agreement in results across different techniques, experimental models and platforms provided a solid foundation for our study and allowed not only a comprehensive description of the effects of nitrate on muscle fa oxidation but also the elucidation of the underlying mechanism. for instance, the use of isolated rat muscle mitochondria allowed us to consider the changes in intra-mitochondrial fa oxidation pathways, whilst the use of permeabilized muscle fibres, protein levels and enzyme activities provided a picture of fa oxidation capacity at the tissue level. meanwhile, targeted analysis of tissue metabolites  supports the notion that changes in capacity measured ex vivo correspond to changes in fa oxidation in vivo. in order to establish underlying mechanisms, we again employed a number of approaches, including dna-binding assays in nitrate-supplemented rats and wild-type and pparα−/− mice, plus cell respiration and gene expression analysis in cultured myocytes alongside the use of targeted inhibitors of upstream actors in our proposed pathway . the finding that nitrate enhanced fa oxidation in cultured myocytes indicates that effects are independent of changes in blood flow, and thus oxygen delivery, secondary to the vasodilatory effects of nitrogen oxides.

as with our previous studies of the effects of dietary nitrate on tissue metabolism and oxygen delivery  <cit> , our use of a sqc diet and deionized water allowed us to acutely manipulate micronutrient concentrations in rats and mice, whilst accurately monitoring nitrate intake without restricting food or water intake. the nitrate interventions used were relatively short-term in duration  and although we would expect this to reflect the long-term effects of nitrate supplementation it would be worth confirming this. whilst we have shown that nitrate still exerts these effects in hypoxic rats, it would be interesting to additionally investigate and assess the effectiveness of these mechanisms during other metabolic stresses .

the effects of nitrate and hypoxia on fa oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis appear to be tissue-specific. for instance, whilst we previously found that nitrate supplementation  modestly increased the capacity of rat cardiac mitochondria to oxidise palmitoyl-carnitine  and prevented the hypoxic suppression of fa oxidation  <cit> , there was no such hypoxic suppression apparent in the soleus, and instead the dominant effect of nitrate was to double the capacity for palmitoyl-carnitine respiration. in the mammalian heart, fa oxidation is the major source of atp generation under normal conditions  <cit> , whereas skeletal muscle utilises carbohydrate and fa more evenly  <cit> , so there is more scope to increase fa oxidation in skeletal muscle. it is perhaps surprising that there was no significant loss of mitochondria and/or fa oxidation capacity in the hypoxic rat soleus, given that such effects are well-documented in human skeletal muscle following sustained exposure to hypoxia ; however, it should be noted, this does not occur in humans with more acute exposure  <cit> . the relative preservation of fa oxidation in hypoxia may also be a particular feature of the soleus, a highly-oxidative, type  <dig> muscle, which contrasts with the mixed fibre-type vastus lateralis commonly biopsied for use in human studies. it is notable, however, that whilst there are variations in mitochondrial function between different muscles of the mouse hindlimb, it is mouse soleus that most closely resembled human quadriceps in terms of the coupling control of electron transport during fa oxidation  <cit> .

meanwhile, in wat , nitrate and hypoxia act synergistically in promoting the browning response, with the greatest expression of pgc-1α, cpt <dig> and, particularly, ucp <dig> occurring under hypoxic/nitrate-supplemented conditions  <cit> . it is possible that hypoxia systemically augments the production of no from dietary nitrate by sequential reduction, with the expression and nitrate reductase activity of xanthine oxidoreductase increasing under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . the increased availability of no in low oxygen conditions may, however, be offset in skeletal muscle and heart, by the hif-dependent downregulation of pparα and pgc-1α  <cit> , preventing downstream metabolic effects. indeed, in the absence of hypoxia, there are striking parallels between the effects of nitrate on rat wat and skeletal muscle, particularly regarding the dose-dependency of the changes observed. for instance, citrate synthase activity increased in both tissues in a dose-dependent manner, whilst cpt <dig> protein/activity peaked at the lowest dose of nitrate used  as did ucp <dig> in wat  <cit> .

the dose dependent effects of nitrate we report herein may be attributable to differential effects on the expression of ppar isoforms and pgc-1α. at the lowest dose of nitrate used, there was no induction of pparα, but the greatest expression of pparβ/δ and enhanced pparβ/δ-dna binding, alongside elevated cpt <dig> activity. whilst this dose was not associated with a significant increase in mitochondrial palmitoyl-carnitine respiration or muscle 14c-palmitate oxidation ex vivo, we saw decreased long-chain fas in the muscles of these rats, suggesting more subtle effects on in vivo fa oxidation at this dose. at the medium dose of nitrate, pparα expression was induced in addition to pparβ/δ and this resulted in increased palmitoyl-carnitine respiration and 14c-palmitate oxidation, alongside a larger decrease in total long-chain fas. whilst there was no increase in citrate synthase activity at this dose, pgc-1α levels were increased. at the highest dose of nitrate used, pparβ/δ expression and pparβ/δ-dna binding fell below that of lower doses, though pparα expression and dna-binding activity was highest. our data suggest a suppression of pparβ/δ by pparα activation, an effect previously described in rat brain astrocytes  <cit> . alongside an increase in mitochondrial density at the highest dose, the elevated pparα levels supported the greatest rate of 14c-palmitate oxidation and resulted in the lowest levels of total long-chain fas, although, interestingly, mitochondrial palmitoyl-carnitine respiration  was no higher than at the medium dose. these findings show similarities with high-fat fed mice that have undertaken exercise-training to elevate pgc-1α expression  <cit> . there was surprisingly good agreement between the effects of nitrate at these doses between rats and mice in the present study. no production rates  <cit>  and circulating nitrate/nitrite concentrations  <cit>  are similar between rats and humans, but lower than those in mice  <cit> . our data, however, demonstrate that nitrate supplementation at the intermediate dose results in increased pparα dna-binding  in mice too.

the intermediate dose of nitrate used herein matches that shown to have metabolic effects in studies of human muscle  <cit>  and which can be achieved in humans via a slight modification of the diet, e.g. via a modest increase in consumption of leafy green vegetables such as spinach and beetroot  <cit> . in humans, this dose was found to decrease the oxygen cost of exercise  <cit> , improve mitochondrial efficiency via a lowering of leak state respiration  <cit> , and to lower whole-body resting metabolic rate  <cit> . these effects were associated with decreased muscle expression of the putative uncoupler adenine nucleotide translocase, but also a strong trend towards decreased ucp <dig> expression  <cit> . our findings in rodents do seem to contradict some of these effects in humans. however, beyond the obvious difference in species, some other key differences between the studies should be noted, along with some similarities. firstly, our rats were maintained on a standardised version of normal rat chow, which is low in fat content, whereas the humans essentially consumed a regular diet, albeit avoiding foodstuffs high in nitrate  <cit> . therefore, rats would have conceivably had a greater scope to increase their capacity for fa oxidation compared to humans as ppar activation via the diet would have been lower at baseline, whilst the rats were also sedentary and would therefore be expected to have relatively low muscle mitochondrial contents at baseline. in addition, the mitochondrial respiration studies of human vastus lateralis employed pyruvate and malate as substrates  <cit> , as opposed to the fa derivative palmitoyl-carnitine that we used here, and as such they were not optimised to see differences in fa oxidation. interestingly, however, although leak state respiration increased in the rats with nitrate supplementation in our study, respiratory control ratios  did in fact increase in both rats and wild-type mice, indicating improved mitochondrial coupling and thus enhanced efficiency with a higher rate of oxidative phosphorylation. finally, we have not measured whole-body oxygen consumption in these rats, and it would be interesting to do so, but previous work from our group with the livers of rats receiving the same doses of nitrate showed a dose-dependent fall in hif- <dig> activation, suggesting a better matching of oxygen supply and demand despite decreased circulating haemoglobin, and thus possibly indicating decreased oxygen consumption or improved mitochondrial efficiency, at least in this tissue  <cit> .

our finding of enhanced skeletal muscle fa oxidation capacity with moderate consumption of dietary nitrate now deserves further investigation in healthy human subjects, as well as those with metabolic disease, with further investigation in animal models of metabolic syndrome. a similar dose of nitrate was previously found to have anti-obesity and insulin-sensitizing effects in the enos−/− mouse, which exhibits a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype  <cit> , and it would be interesting to see whether nitrate exerts similarly-protective effects in obese and insulin-resistant rodents where the primary defect is not one of no-production, e.g. diet-induced obesity or leptin-deficiency/resistance. in combination with our previous finding that nitrate stimulates the browning of wat, however, our work suggests that nitrate supplementation holds promise as a potential therapy for metabolic disease.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that a moderate dose of dietary nitrate enhances skeletal muscle fa oxidation capacity by promoting intra-mitochondrial pathways of fa oxidation and, at higher doses, mitochondrial biogenesis. the underlying mechanism is dose-dependent, and occurs via enhanced no bioavailability and increased muscle cgmp levels, leading to the upregulation of pparα and pgc-1α.
