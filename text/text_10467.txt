BACKGROUND
chromium  is the seventh most abundant metal in the earth's crust and an important environmental contaminant released mainly by leather, paint and fertilizer industries  <cit> . stable forms of cr are the trivalent cr  and the hexavalent cr  species. being a strong oxidizer, cr  is highly toxic and more mobile in soil/water systems than cr   <cit> . cr contaminates food sources and accumulates in agricultural products through water, air, and polluted soils posing a serious health risk to people worldwide  <cit> . rice consumers are exposed to significant amounts of chromium and other heavy metals dissolved in field water  <cit> . in reduced soil environment of rice crop, the heavy metals go into soil solution, risking their uptake by the rice crop  <cit> . the who/fao expert committee on food additives has set the provisional maximum tolerable weekly intake for cr at  <dig>  μg/kg- <dig> of body wt week- <dig> <cit> .

several studies have been carried out on the uptake and translocation of cr from soil by different plants  <cit> . cr  is actively taken up by active processes, probably mediated by carriers of essential ions such as sulfate or iron, whereas cr  is probably taken up passively by cation exchange  <cit> . chromium compounds are detrimental to seed germination, seedling growth, growth and development, leading to severe oxidative damage to cells  <cit> . chromium interferes with several metabolic processes including photosynthesis, water relation and uptake of nutrients, resulting in reduced root growth and phytomass, chlorosis, stunting and finally plant death  <cit> . panda  <cit>  reported the effect of cr exposure on roots of developing rice seedlings and concluded that the induction of oxidative stress is the main process underlying cr toxicity in plants.

in plants, a predominant model for detoxification of heavy metals is by the formation of complexes of heavy metals with phytochelatins . as a detoxification mechanism, such complexes are compartmentalized in vacuoles. however, unlike other heavy metals such as cu, pb and cd, cr is unable to induce pcs, and thus detoxification mechanism for this metal is poorly understood  <cit> . molecular events underlying cr toxicity and the defense signal transduction have been only partially elucidated. a number of genes potentially involved in cr resistance and accumulation were identified by cdna-aflp  <cit> . the study suggested four willow species  had the existence of common mechanisms of gene regulation in response to cr, pathogen attack and senescence-mediated programmed cell death. however, no mechanism specific to cr was identified.

transcriptional regulation, also known as transcriptome reprogramming, is essential for plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses. use of "omic" studies have provided more inside about the physiological and molecular effects of environmental stress which led to the identification of genes involved and their expression patterns during the course of stress perception and response  <cit> . recent studies suggested that signaling pathways regulated by abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene, as well as ros signaling pathways, play key roles in the crosstalk between biotic and abiotic stress signaling. the molecular mechanisms that are involved in each stress have been revealed independently. however, understanding of convergence points between biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways remain rudimentary  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to explore the cross talk between the abiotic-stress responses.

high-throughput genomic technologies have made it possible to analyze expression of thousands of genes at a time. we have earlier reported comparative genome-wide transcriptome analysis of rice seedlings treated with as and as and identified molecular processes and networks associated with response to these metals  <cit> . detailed analysis of genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rice root is reported here, following cr-plant interaction. such studies are important for the identification of genes responsible for tolerance, accumulation and defense response in plants with respect to cr stress. rice root metabolome analysis was also carried out to relate differential transcriptome data to biological processes affected by cr  stress in rice. our analyses suggest that cr-specific motifs identified in this study are significantly over represented in the promoter regions of cr-responsive genes.

RESULTS
physiological responses of rice seedling to chromium stress
seedlings grown on media containing different concentrations of cr  showed retardation in the growth of the seedlings with increasing concentration of cr . the shoot and root growth in terms of root length, shoot length, root and shoot weight was significantly inhibited at  <dig> μm cr  with respect to control. significant decline  in the length and weight of roots  was observed in seedlings exposed to  <dig> μm cr. our results are in accordance to the reported cr toxicity on seedling growth, nutrient and water imbalance  <cit> .

the values are means of triplicates ± sd. *, ** and *** = significantly different at p ≤  <dig> , p ≤  <dig>  and p ≤  <dig> , respectively, according to student's unpaired t-test.

chromium accumulation in roots and shoots increased with increasing concentration of cr . the chromium accumulation was higher in roots as compared to shoot at all the concentrations . after  <dig> h the root tissue accumulated  <dig> mg kg- <dig> dw cr. at  <dig> μm cr exposure, roots accumulated more that  <dig> fold cr in comparison to shoots. this difference in cr accumulation in both the tissues decreased with increased cr exposure. at  <dig> μm, roots accumulated only  <dig> fold higher cr in comparison to shoot. the results suggest that at higher concentration roots mobilize cr to shoot affectively to minimize cr toxicity in roots. cr was not detected in any part of the control plants .

significant increase in lipid peroxidation was observed after  <dig> d treatment . mda, a decomposition product of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides, has often been utilized as a biomarker for lipid peroxidation  <cit> , which is an effect of oxidative damage. loss of membrane integrity is the final and irreversible phase of cell damage and is closely linked with membrane lipid peroxidation  <cit> . large changes in the physical properties of membrane lipids during heavy-metal stress appear to contribute to the loss of membrane's selective permeability.

free proline levels in roots were higher in  <dig> h treatment in comparison to  <dig> d post treatment . rapid accumulation of free proline is a typical response to heavy metal stress  <cit> . when exposed to abiotic and biotic stress, many plants accumulate high amounts of proline, in some cases several times the sum of other amino acids  <cit> . proline protects cell membranes of onion against salt injury  <cit>  and is generally assumed to serve as a physiologically compatible solute that maintains a favorable osmotic potential between the cell and its surroundings. after  <dig> d, the oxidative injury was much higher as evidenced by higher level of free radical-induced peroxidation of lipid membranes. proline level declined as it was unable to protect the cell from oxidative damage.

the level of non-protein thiols was statistically higher in roots after  <dig> h and  <dig> d treatment with  <dig> μm cr . their function is attributed to heavy metal detoxification and the homeostasis of essential nutrients through the immobilisation of metal ions and their subsequent vacuolar sequestration, thus preventing them from interfering with cellular metabolism  <cit> . thiol incorporation is made at the cost of sulphur-containing proteins necessary for development. this may retard overall growth of the plant as seen in our study . the stable amount of thiols in control root results from a balance between the input and the output of non-protein thiols, through the incorporation of cystein. exposure to cr disturbs this balance because of the high consumption of these thiol groups.

general features of cr -stress expression profiles
roots are the main organ for heavy metal penetration. we exposed roots of  <dig> d old seedlings for  <dig> h in  <dig> μm cr  to analyze the change in transcriptome. the higher metal exposures yielded a linear increase in root tissue accumulation, leading to higher degree of toxicity. however, our results evidenced the importance of the concentrations used in works of this nature, since in exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations, which are themselves representative of high contaminations; plants were able to cope with stress without displaying any noticeable phytotoxic effects, despite some accumulation of the metal accumulation. however, short-term exposure to higher cr concentration indicated the vulnerability of this species to high cr. genome wide gene expression analysis was conducted using rna from rice roots exposed to cr   for  <dig> h in hydroponic solution. an average of 47% probe sets hybridize to the transcripts, as analyzed by gcos. utilizing high-density affymetrix gene-chip based microarray representing  <dig>  genes, we observed that the expression of  <dig> genes was up-regulated, and that of  <dig> genes was down-regulated by cr . functional analysis of these genes was done to relate the genome response to the shift in biological activities. the differentially expressed genes belong to various gene families related to transporters, cellular stress response, regulatory proteins, growth and development and secondary metabolism. a list of the up- and down-regulated probe sets under cr stressed rice seedling roots with their annotations are provided in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  tables s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively.

oligonucleotide primers for the  <dig> genes related to transport, stress, and defense functions were used for validation of the microarray data through realtime pcr . the validation was carried out separately for root, to resolve tissue-specific differences in the expression of selected genes. the results obtained from the  <dig> genes tested by real time pcr agree with the trend of regulation identified by microarray analysis. the pdr-like abc transporter gene  was highly expressed to cr in root, two multidrug resistance protein  <dig>  were expressed at a higher level in roots, five glutathione s-transferase gstu <dig> , two peptide transporter  and one sulfate transporter  <dig>   were specifically up-regulated in chromium-stressed roots. this validates the microarray analysis. three hsps  and seven cytochrome p <dig>  genes were up-regulated in the chromium treated root as in case of the microarray results.

gene annotation and detail gene response to cr -stress
functional distribution of the submitted probe sets  in the 2nd level of the genebins ontology is provided in figure 2http://bioinfoserver.rsbs.anu.edu.au/utils/genebins/. the percentage represents the proportion of submitted probe sets that have been assigned in the corresponding functional category. many genes are indicated as "unclassified" because the annotation of the rice genome does not assign any putative function and these are stated as ''hypothetical" or ''expressed". a large set of differentially expressed genes belongs to the defense and stress response in plants, in addition to being involved in general metabolism. the current analyses showed that  <dig> genes were up-regulated, and  <dig> genes were down-regulated by cr . among the down-regulated genes, the most affected genes are for energy metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , stilbene, coumarine and lignin biosynthesis , phenylalanine metabolism , cell growth and death , photosynthesis , lipid metabolism , biodegradation of xenobiotics , photosystem ii , amino acid metabolism , cell cycle  etc.

among the up-regulated genes, the most affected genes are biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , specially flavonoid biosynthesis , lipid metabolism , amino acid metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , biodegradation of xenobiotics , ascorbate and aldarate metabolism , membrane transport  specially abc- <dig> a abc- <dig> type transport system atp-binding protein  and abc transporters , glutathione metabolism , mapk signaling pathway  and a large number of glutathione s-transferase  etc. on percentage basis, the most effected genes that are down-regulated during cr  stress are those for energy metabolism, cell growth and death, development. the most up-regulated genes are related to amino acid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and xenobiotics, membrane transport and signal transduction.

the genes coding for proteins such as glutathione s- transferase  which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism, are found to be unregulated in cr stress. gsts are known to be induced by a number of intracellular and environmental factors that include heavy-metal stress  <cit> . normally, gsts catalyze the conjugation of toxic molecules with reduced glutathione  and target them for atp-dependent transport into the vacuole. the reduced /oxidized  glutathione ratio increases steadily through the course of the experiment under chromium stress  <cit> . this indicates that gsh was rapidly oxidized to gssg indicating a possible role of gsh as an antioxidant in chromium stress in plants. standeven and wetterhahn  <cit>  reported that gsh protects against the acute nephrotoxicity of cr, although it is not clear whether gsh is directly involved in the intracellular metabolism of cr at non-toxic doses. we analyzed expression of gsts in various vegetative and reproductive developmental stages of rice. a hierarchical cluster display generated from the average log signal values indicates differential expression profiles of genes in various tissues and development stages as given in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  it shows that os09g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os10g <dig> and os10g <dig> are root-specific. we also compared their expression pattern in abiotic and biotic stresses . our study with microarray analysis using different heavy metal stresses suggests that these gsts are not specific to cr . to validate our microarray results we analyzed the gst activity in rice roots exposed to  <dig> μm cr . higher gst activity was indeed noticed after  <dig> h treatment .

a large number of cytochrome p450-related genes  were up-regulated in cr stress. cytochrome p <dig> s constitutes a large superfamily of enzymes, with  <dig> members in rice that are involved in the metabolism of plant biosynthetic pathways, including those for uv protectants , pigments , defense compounds , fatty acids, hormones , signaling molecules , accessory pigments  and structural polymers   <cit> . up-regulation of cyt <dig> gene family during heavy metal stress has been reported earlier, using microarray experiments, indicating their role in heavy metal detoxification  <cit> . kawahigashi et al.,  <cit>  reported transgenic rice transformed with genes encoding human cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases cyp1a <dig>  cyp2b <dig>  and cyp2c <dig> were more tolerant to various herbicides than nontransgenic nipponbare rice, owing to enhanced metabolism by the introduced p <dig> enzymes. however, one of the big challenges is to define the range of functions for individual p <dig> proteins that show altered expression during cr-stress.

numerous genes related to the peroxidase family were down-regulated in cr stress. it suggests that the thylakoid membranes are susceptible to lipid peroxidation caused by chromium stress. it is presumed that the down regulation of peroxidases may be due to chromium stress-induced damage to thylakoid membranes caused by lipoxygenases leading to increase in lipid peroxidation as evidenced by higher mda content in root tissue . the disruption of the chloroplast ultra structure and inhibition of electron transport processes due to cr has been reported  <cit> . up-regulation of a set of genes encoding peroxidases has also been reported during as stress in rice  <cit> .

three heat shock proteins  are up-regulated in cr stress. out of the  <dig> heat shock proteins, two are dnak family proteins and one is hsp20/alpha crystalline family protein. dnak is the prokaryotic analogue of eukaryotic hsp <dig>  out of these, two  have been shown to be up-regulated during as stress in rice  <cit> . hsps are produced by all organisms in response to increased temperature and other stresses. these assist in the assembly, folding, and translocation of other proteins  <cit> . five heat shock proteins are down-regulated in this study. higher transcript accumulation of hsp90- <dig> has been reported in tomato plants following exposure to cr  treatment  <cit> . two differentially expressed dehydrins,  were up- and down-regulated respectively during cr treatment. dehydrins are known to be produced in response to low temperature and drought stress  <cit> .

two cysteine synthase  and one glutathione synthetase  were down-regulated in rice roots following cr stress in our study. glutathione synthetase is the second enzyme in the glutathione biosynthesis pathway. it catalyses the condensation of gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine to form glutathione  <cit> . a large number of gsts were up-regulated leading to reduction in the glutathione pool. glutathione  is required to reduce cr  to cr  in vitro  <cit> . therefore, down-regulation of gsh biosynthetic genes implies that sulphate pool is reduced because of large utilization of gsh, leading to down-regulation of glutathione synthetase and cysteine synthase. one l-ascorbate oxidase homolog precursor  was noticed as up-regulated in our study. this enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, participates in ascorbate metabolism  <cit>  and might be useful in providing antioxidant pool during cr stress in rice.

a large number of transporters were differentially expressed after challenge with cr. four members of sulfate transpoters were differentially expressed in our study. out of these, two  were up and two  were down-regulated respectively during cr stress. there are many different sulfate transporters in plants that differ in their intracellular locations, expression patterns, and kinetic properties. sulfate can enter plants through a high-affinity sulfate transporter present in the plasma membrane  <cit> , which may lead to enhanced production of s-rich metal-binding peptides , thus providing metal tolerance and resulting in metal accumulation. these sulfate transporters are expressed mainly in the roots of plants and are up-regulated under sulfur-starved conditions and heavy-metal stress  <cit> . a transgenic mustard plant, developed using a high-affinity sulfate-transporter construct, shows altered metal tolerance and accumulation  <cit> .

five mate-efflux family proteins  were up-regulated on challenge with cr. plant mate are localized in both vacuoles and the plasma membrane. they transport secondary metabolites and xenobiotics probably through h+-exchange. the rice genome possesses  <dig> mate orthologs http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), although their transport properties have not been elucidated. out of the five mates up-regulated during cr stress, one  has been repoted to be up-regulated during as stress in rice  <cit> . nawrath et al.  <cit>  reported that the arabidopsis mate gene eds <dig> is involved in the salicylic-acid-dependent signaling cascade, which is triggered by pathogens and exposure to uv light. analysis of the potential metabolic networks from our microarray studies also indicates the possible role of salicylic-acid-dependent signaling pathway in cr stress.

ten abc transporter family proteins  were up-regulated in cr stress. polypeptides encoded by abc transporter gene family transport a wide variety of substrates across extra- and intracellular membranes, including metabolic products, lipids and sterols, and drugs. the results suggest that abc transporters might play an important role in transport of chromium into the cell. one transporter of a major facilitator family , two metal cation transporter , one potassium transporter , two multidrug resistance-associated proteins  were up-regulated specifically in cr stress. one peptide transporter ptr <dig> , one oligopeptide transporter , and one pot family protein  were also up-regulated. moreover, six aquaporin proteins  and six heavy metal-associated domain containing proteins  were down-regulated in this study.

thirty six transcription factors were differentially expressed following chromium stress. among these, eight wrky transcription factors  were up-regulated. at the same time, four wrky transcription factors  are down-regulated after chromium exposure. these are involved in various plant processes but most notably, in coping with diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. one  of the eight wrky transcription factor up-regulated during cr stress has been shown to be up-regulated during as stress also  <cit> . one helix-turn-helix protein  was up-regulated in chromium stress which has also been shown to be up-regulated during other heavy metal stresses  <cit> . eleven myb family transcription factors  were up-regulated and thirteen myb family transcription factors were down-regulated. two bzip transcription factor domain containing proteins  were up- and four  are down-regulated in cr stress. in addition to the transcription factors, thirteen zinc finger proteins  were up- and thirty eight zinc finger proteins are down-regulated during chromium stress. this clearly suggests that a complex network of regulatory pathways modulates cr-response of rice.

in our microarray experiments, we compared datasets for shift in expression at different developmental stages of rice and observed that  <dig> and  <dig> probe sets up- and down-regulated respectively were root specific during cr-stress . functional analyses suggests that the up-regulated genes include genes for gst glutathione s-transferase , tyrosine metabolism , biodegradation of xenobiotics , mapk signaling pathway , amino acid metabolism , lipid metabolism , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , signal transduction , abc transporters , energy metabolism  and carbohydrate metabolism . the down-regulated genes are related to peroxidase , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , lipid metabolism , energy metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , amino acid metabolism , biodegradation of xenobiotics , membrane transport , mapk signaling pathway , cell growth and death , signal transduction , cellular processes , metabolism of cofactors and vitamins , folding, sorting and degradation  etc. the results indicate that cr  triggers toxicity within  <dig> h of exposure, leading to differential expression of a large number of genes required in cellular function. this was further supported by the  <dig> d old seedling data where growth of the rice seedlings was significantly reduced after  <dig> μm cr  treatment. according to root specific analysis, members of gst gene family are up-regulated during heavy metal stress, which might help in heavy metal detoxification and is considered to be an important antioxidant involved in the cellular defense against toxicants. only one root specific abc transporter  was up-regulated during chromium stress, which might help in the transport of chromium  inside the cell. the uptake of cr  is through carriers used for the uptake of essential metals for plant metabolism. the pathway of cr  transport is an active mechanism  <cit> . we studied the expression profile of this transporter in different heavy metal stresses and found that this gene is not only expressed in cr  but also in pb-stress . it may be possible that pb and cr  are transported through this transporter. we also studied their expression in various vegetative and reproductive developmental stages of rice and found that this gene is root specific .

large numbers of genes related to mapk signaling pathway are down-regulated during chromium stress. mitogen-activated protein  kinases are serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that respond to extracellular stimuli  and regulate various cellular activities, such as gene expression, mitosis, differentiation, proliferation, cell survival/apoptosis and are involved in cell response to growth factors  <cit> . the map kinases and a large number of genes related to amino acid metabolism are down-regulated during cr stress. these might lead to reduced growth of plants.

cross talk between the cr -stress responses and abiotic stress has also been explored which revealed a high degree of similarity. specifically, cold, draught and salt stress was found to induce many of the same genes as did chromium stress. plant response to chromium and abiotic stresses is very similar, with both disrupting the ion and osmotic homeostasis of the plant, thus the signaling pathways would be expected to be similar. expression of several nac domain-containing proteins, wrky transcription factors, cytochrome p <dig> and basic region/leu zipper  also got induced similar to what was observed during abiotic stress  <cit> . there is plenty of evidence that mapk cascade plays a crucial role in various biotic and abiotic stress responses and in hormone responses that include ros signaling  <cit> . apart from this, the role of gsh-dependent detoxification reactions is well established in our study, as a large number of gsts are upregulated under chromium stress.

metabolic shift following cr  stress
metabolites in rice roots exposed to  <dig> μm cr  for  <dig> h analyzed mainly by gc-ms and nmr. assignment of the compounds was done comparing the gc-ms profile and 1h spectra of reference compounds together with biological magnetic resonance data bank http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/ and wherever necessary, by spiking with appropriate internal standards.  <dig> d cosy spectra was also extensively used to resolve the complexity of the overlapping/interfering spectral regions to identify the exact molecule in the extract . the content of several metabolites including lactate, fructose, uracil and alanine  increased following exposure to cr stress. proline accumulated 3-fold in comparison to control. this increase in proline content is lower in comparison to spectorophotometric measurement . this might be because spectrophotometric analysis is not very sensitive method to study proline content and measurements were done on the basis of fresh weight basis where as in gcms/nmr it is dry weight basis. however, both the data sets provided increase in proline content. proline is a compatible osmolyte, and plays an important role in adaptation to osmotic stress  <cit> . protection of structural and functional integrity of m <dig> lactate dehydrogenase by proline has been reported  <cit> . in plants, proline is synthesized not only from glutamate but also from arginine/ornithine. in our limited metabolites profiling, ornithine content also increased suggesting ornithine may be used as substrate for enhanced biosynthesis of proline. as ornithine is formed from arginine, its catabolic transformation into proline depends on the allosteric regulation of arginase by proline  <cit> . our results on the higher content of ornithine suggest the significance of urea cycle in contributing to the accumulation of proline in rice roots under cr  stress. however, increased expression of the genes related to proline biosysthesis from ornithine was not observed in microarray data. this may be because of our more stringent criteria set for microarray analysis or modulation in post-transcriptional modifications of polypeptides involved in different processes. increase in alanine and uracil content by cr stress may be related to each other as uridine and uracil work as precursors of alanine during salt stress in bruguiera sexangula cells  <cit> . the uracil salvage machinery in nucleotide metabolism observed in salt stressed cells may be closely related to the salt tolerance of mangrove plants due to reduction in the consumption of energy and substrates required for pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. similar situation might be operating during cr stress in rice.

aindentified and quantified by gc-ms, b identified and quantified by nmr.

higher accumulation of various fatty acids was observed in cr exposed rice roots. cellular fatty acid composition is the result of a sum of complex phenomena, required for maintaining optimal viability of against external challenges. the biosynthesis of a reactive target, such as linoleic acid and its subsequent peroxidation by the radicals generated by cells after stress exposure prevents major damage to cellular dna  <cit> . our results showed that the content of linoleic acid  was highest in rice root under cr  stress. the results agree with the known common effect of stress on the increase in unsaturation level of the fatty acids in plants  <cit> . the possibility of the increase of unsaturation through linoleic acid in more tolerant plants has been reported earlier  <cit> . stigmasterol, β-sitosterol and campesterol are the most common phytosterols and their content was modulated during stress conditions. salinity increased linoleic  and linolenic  acids and stigmasterol, but decreased palmitoleic  and oleic  acids and sitosterol in broccoli roots  <cit> . during cr stress in rice, the level of both stigmasterol and sitosterol decreased in the roots.

simultaneous analysis of microarray and metabolite content using plantmetgenmap software http://bioinfo.bti.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/metgenmap/home.cgi suggested that sucrose degradation pathway was modulated in cr stress response . three main fermentation pathways are active in plants during stress response: ethanol, lactic acid, and a plant specific pathway which produces alanine from glutamate, pyruvate and uracil. these operate as a rescue mechanism when respiration is arrested. their expression was enhanced under cr stress.

metabolic networks derived from transcriptome expression profiles
the derivatisation of potential metabolic networks from microarray data is a very useful method for maximizing information  <cit> . to identify the potential changes in cellular functions, transcriptome interaction networks of differentially regulated data sets in the array have been analyzed using the software pathway studio . the pathway analysis shows that chromium-stress response influences the pathways related to signal transduction, plant growth, plant development, disease resistance, plant defense, root growth, pathogenesis and photosynthesis . the pathway analysis also indicates that abscisic acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism and ascorbate metabolism are affected during chromium stress. our analysis suggests that chromium affects mainly cell growth, cell division and growth rate. by clicking on any of the biological objects within the pathway, more detailed information for each object can be obtained . the nodes show the predicted metabolomes that may modulate molecular functions. the results are indicated of a vast reservoir of information which needs to be utilized validated systematically for understanding detailed mechanisms involved in the chromium stress response of rice.

identification of over-represented motifs in promoters of differentially regulated genes during chromium stress
as described in materials and methods, the promoters of the up-regulated, down-regulated and the total rice genes were analysed for significant abundance of the  <dig>   <dig> and 8nt motifs. the lift, support and confidence criteria used were described by doi et al.,  <cit> . this analysis was done in two steps, the first was based on the frequency  and the second on the occurrence . in the first step, custom perl script was used to calculate frequency of all the motifs in up-regulated, down-regulated and total rice promoters. the motifs having lift greater than or equal to one  were selected for further analysis. in the second step, custom perl script was used to calculate the occurrence of  <dig> motifs in chromium specific up-regulated promoters  and all rice promoters . the occurrence counts of the motifs in test data set were subtracted from the control dataset to overcome the effect of test dataset in control dataset. similar analysis was done for  <dig> motifs of the down-regulated dataset. the lift based on the occurrence was calculated for  <dig> and  <dig> motifs. the motifs were filtered on lift greater than or equal to two . the result gave  <dig> and  <dig> motifs as over-represented in up-regulated and down-regulated promoters respectively. to further strengthen the analysis, stringent criteria of selecting motifs with greater than or equal to  <dig> occurrences in test dataset was adopted. using these criteria,  <dig> and  <dig> motifs  were selected for up-regulated and down-regulated dataset respectively. to check whether the cr specific motifs were indeed significantly over represented in the promoter regions, occurrence of these motifs in whole genome sequence was carried out. in the background of whole genome the lift value for these  <dig>  and  <dig>  motifs were significantly high in the test dataset. though no functional role has been assigned to any of the motifs, but all of these are present as promoter motifs in the database of orthologus promoters . the motifs of up-and down-regulated datasets were classified in different clusters on the basis of their occurrence in promoters of different genes .

clusters of up-regulated datasets
the promoters containing the cr specific motifs were used for functional clustering. the promoters were clustered according to the presence of various motifs. five clusters for the up and down-regulated genes were generated by k-means clustering and functional annotation was carried out using go annotation

cluster  <dig> of the up-regulated promoters had an over-representation of genes related to transcription factor activity, dna binding, catalytic activity and response to stress . four motifs  were highly represented in this set. two other motifs  were also present in these genes, though at a lower frequency. the second cluster had motifs tcgtcga and cgatcga . the genes in this cluster belonged to functional categories indicative of catalytic activity, response to stress and secondary metabolite processes. cluster  <dig> included genes related to response to stress . the other members in the cluster included transferases, hydrolases and proteins with catalytic activity. however no distinct motifs were identified as characteristic of this cluster. cluster  <dig> has a clear over representation of the motif gctagct . there were few genes in this cluster, most of those were related to response to stress. genes for transporters, hydrolases and protein binding activity were high in this group. cluster  <dig> had an over representation of the motifs agctagc and tagctag . the genes in this cluster were related to signal transduction, response to stress, secondary metabolites, kinases, hydrolases and catalytic activity. in silico analysis of proximal promoter of one of the root specific putative abc transporter  contains  <dig> motifs . these motifs are present in a large number of up-regulated genes .

clusters of down-regulated datasets
cluster  <dig> has an over-representation of the motifs ttatcc, cttatc, cttatgc and ccttatc . the genes in this cluster were mainly related to translation and structural molecules. tatematsu et al  <cit>  reported that the promoters of genes down-regulated after main stem decapitation in arabidopsis, were enriched for ttatcc motif that resembles the sugar-repressive element  <cit> . no functional role has been assigned to the other motifs. cluster  <dig> has a clear over-representation of cttatc motif . the genes in this cluster were mainly related to hydrolase activity. over-representation of gcccatg motif was observed in cluster  <dig> . the genes in this cluster were mainly related to response to stress and rna binding. cluster  <dig> contains motifs cctatcc, gataagg, ctatcca, tatcctc and cgcgagc which were present in genes related to response to stress and translation . cluster <dig> has one motif  which is often present in genes related to catalytic activity, nucleotide binding and hydrolase activity . predominance of different motifs in the subsets of genes suggests the involvement of motif specific transcription modulating proteins in cr stress response of rice.

CONCLUSIONS
a significant effect on root growth being observed at  <dig> h at  <dig> μm cr  this treatment is further used for transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. cr  treatment was associated with lipid peroxidation and an increased in proline synthesis. transcriptomics analysis revealed that the expression of  <dig> genes was up-regulated, and that of  <dig> genes was down-regulated in roots by cr . most of the genes differentially expressed under both cr  stress were related to glutathione metabolism, transport, and signal-transduction pathways. however, somewhat unexpectedly, up-regulation of phytochelatin synthase was not detected by microarray analysis suggesting that pcs are not involved in cr  detoxification. this might be due to their nonresponsive behavior to cr  stress, which is in agreement with previous report . on the contrary, in our study it is clear that glutathione plays an important role for detoxification of cr-stress. simultaneous analysis of microarray and metabolite content suggested that sucrose degradation pathway was modulated in cr stress response involving three main fermentation pathways operating as a rescue mechanism when respiration is arrested. we also analyzed presence of cis-acting elements in differentially regulated genes during cr  stress. to check whether the cr-specific motifs were indeed significantly over represented in the promoter regions of cr-responsive genes, occurrence of these motifs in whole genome sequence was carried out which suggests significant co-relation between differentially expressed genes and identified motifs.

the rice variety ir- <dig> was germinated and allowed to grow for  <dig> d at 37°c and then transferred to hewitt solution for growth. after  <dig> d of growth, seedlings of uniform size and growth were treated with different concentrations of cr  under standard physiological conditions of  <dig> h light  and  <dig> h dark photoperiod at  <dig> ± 2°c. different concentrations of cr were prepared using k2cr2o <dig> . length of the main root and shoot of seedlings was measured at different time intervals following cr exposure. roots treated with  <dig> μm cr after  <dig> h were taken to evaluate early expressed genes subjected to cr stress. after  <dig> d of growth followed by cr treatment, shoot length, root length, fresh root weight and shoot weight were measured. all the samples were ground in liquid n <dig> and stored at -80°c.

metal accumulation
