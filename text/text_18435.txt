BACKGROUND
cucumber  is one of the most economically important vegetable crops worldwide. moreover, cucumber has been used a model system for studies on plant vascular biology and sex determination  <cit> . however, its growth and production are hindered by multiple abiotic and biotic stresses, such as inappropriate temperature  <cit> , drought  <cit> , and pathogens  <cit> . therefore, the systematic identification and functional study of stress response and tolerance genes in cucumber are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cucumber tolerance and susceptibility. a draft of the cucumber genome sequence has been reported  <cit> , which conveniently allowed the comprehensive overview of several gene families at the genomic level .

to regulate plant development and deal with environmental stress, plants have acquired complex mechanisms during their evolution to sense and transmit environmental stimuli. the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling cascade has emerged as a universal signal transduction module that connects diverse receptors/sensors to cellular and nuclear responses in eukaryotes  <cit> . mapk signaling modules are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, including yeasts, animals, and plants. the classical mapk signaling cascade is minimally composed of three kinases, namely, mapk, mapk kinase , and mapkk kinase   <cit> . these kinases operate as sequential signal transducers that channel, integrate, and amplify information from the cellular environment to transcriptional and metabolic response centers via phosphorylation. mapks are activated by mapkks via the phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in the thr-x-tyr  motif that is located in the activation loop  between the catalytic subdomains vii and viii. mapkks, in turn, are activated by mapkkks when the serine and serine/threonine residues in the s/txxxxxs/t motif are phosphorylated  <cit> .

in plants, mapk cascades participate in numerous processes, including cell division  <cit> , developmental programs  <cit> , hormonal responses  <cit> , and signaling responses to various forms of biotic and abiotic stress, such as pathogen infection  <cit> , wounding  <cit> , drought, salinity  <cit> , uv irradiation  <cit> , ozone  <cit> , and reactive oxygen species   <cit> . to date, several plant mapk signaling cascades have been characterized in details. the first signaling module that was identified in plant is arabidopsis mekk1-mkk4/5-mpk3/ <dig> cascade, which plays an vital role in plant innate immunity  <cit> . another module of arabidopsis, mekk1-mkk1/2-mpk <dig>  was shown to positively regulate defense responses against necrotrophic fungi while negatively regulating defenses against biotrophic pathogens  <cit> . the mekk1-mkk2-mpk <dig> cascade is also activated during cold acclimation, and contributes to the acquisition of freezing tolerance  <cit> . in addition, the anp3-mkk6-mpk <dig> cascade facilitates male-specific meiotic cytokinesis  <cit> , whereas the yda-mkk4/5-mpk3/ <dig> module participates in regulating stomatal development in arabidopsis  <cit> . in tobacco, the npk1-mek1-ntf <dig> cascade regulates the resistance to the tobacco mosaic virus mediated the resistant protein n  <cit> . moreover, the npk1-nqk1/ntmek1-nrk <dig> cascade positively regulates tobacco cytokinesis during meiosis and mitosis  <cit> .

recently, a large number of genes encoding proteins involved with the mapk signaling cascade have been identified in various plants after the completion of their whole genome sequence. a total of  <dig> mapk,  <dig> mapkk, and  <dig> mapkkk genes have been reported in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , whereas the rice genome contains  <dig> mapk,  <dig> mapkk, and  <dig> mapkkk genes . recent studies demonstrated that  <dig> mapk,  <dig> mapkk, and  <dig> mapkkk genes can be found in maize , whereas  <dig> putative mapk,  <dig> mapkk, and  <dig> mapkkk genes are in tomato  <cit> . despite being a model vegetable crop for functional genomics, to date, only few mapk cascade genes were cloned and identified in cucumber, such as csmapk <dig>  <cit> , cstipk  , csmap3ka  <cit>  and cscrt <dig>  <cit> . however, no systematic and genome-wide investigations of the mapk signaling cascade gene families have been reported in cucumber yet.

in the present study,  <dig> mapk,  <dig> mapkk, and  <dig> mapkkk genes were identified in cucumber. they were classified into different subfamilies based on phylogenetic trees. the predicted gene structures, chromosomal locations, gene duplicates, and evolutionary mechanism were subsequently analyzed. finally, their transcript profiles in different organs and in response to different stresses, as well as plant hormones, were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr . our data provide a basis for further research on the precise roles of the mapk signaling cascade in cucumber development and in responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. moreover, the findings will contribute to understanding the expansion and evolution of the mapk, mapkk, and mapkkk gene families in plant.

RESULTS
identification of the mapk, mapkk, and mapkkk families in cucumber
to identify mapk, mapkk and mapkkk family genes, we conducted respective blastp searches against the cucumber protein database using query protein sequences including  <dig> mapks,  <dig> mapkks, and  <dig> mapkkks from seven plant species, which resulted in  <dig> hits. meanwhile, a hmm search was also employed to identify all potential mapk cascade sequences containing the serine/threonine-protein kinase-like domain  in cucumber, which resulted in a total of  <dig> hits. the comparison of the sequence from blast and hmm hits were completed and the number of hits was reduced to  <dig> after reduce redundancies and alternative splices. sequences that did not contain the known conserved motifs of the mapk, mapkk, or mapkkk family proteins, respectively, were excluded from further analysis. after multiple steps of screening and validation of the conserved domains, we finally identified  <dig> csmapk,  <dig> csmapkk, and  <dig> csmapkkk genes, respectively. the sequence data of all above mapk cascade genes were downloaded from the cucumber genomics database  . each gene was named according its homology with arabidopsis mapk, mapkk, or mapkkk proteins as suggested by the mapk research community  <cit>  . if two or more cucumber genes had the same homolog in arabidopsis, they were distinguished by an extra number. for example, csa1m <dig>  csa5m <dig>  and csa1m <dig> are the homologs of atmpk <dig>  so they were named csmpk9- <dig>  csmpk9- <dig>  and csmpk9- <dig>  respectively. given the alternative mrna splicing in the cucumber mapk and mapkkk gene families , the subsequent analysis of each gene was restricted to the longest encoding protein. notablely, csmapk <dig>  was previously identified to be involved in brassinosteroid-induced stress tolerance in cucumber  <cit>  and csmpk <dig> was characterized as csnmapk or cstipk . meanwhile, csraf <dig> and csmekk <dig> belonging to csmapkkk family was previously named as csctr <dig>  <cit>  and csmap3ka  <cit> , respectively. in order to keep consistent with the new nomenclature of other mapk cascade genes in cucumber, all these genes were renamed according to the orthologous sequence similarity with a. thaliana .table  <dig> characteristics of the mapk genes in cucumber

to assess whether the genes identified in this study had existing support, we performed blastn searches against the cucumber expressed sequence tag  and unigene database. the existence of all the predicted members of the mapk and mapkk families in c. sativus was supported by est or unigene hits . similarly, most of the mapkkk sequences matched est hits and cdna sequences  except  <dig> mapkkks representing  <dig>  % where no such data were available.table  <dig> characteristics of the mapkk genes in cucumber

the  <dig> csmapk genes were randomly distributed on  <dig> cucumber chromosomes, except chromosome  <dig> . these csmapk genes were predicted to encoding  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, with putative molecular weights  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda and theoretical isoelectric points  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the subcellular localization was predicated and the csmapk were located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, except csmpk <dig>  where it was present in plasma membrane . meanwhile, the  <dig> csmapkk predicted proteins contained 320– <dig> amino acids, with the mws ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda and pis ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . they were predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus . all the  <dig> csmapkkk genes were randomly distributed on all the cucumber chromosomes. the polypeptide lengths of these csmapkkk genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> aa with mws ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. similarly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> csmapkkk proteins were located in the cytoplasm or nucleus. the remaining proteins were present in plasma membrane, mitochondria, or chloroplast .

sequence similarity analysis of mapk cascade genes between arabidopsis and cucumber was conducted using predicted protein sequences . the amino acid sequences of the homologous mapk gene pairs in these two species showed high similarity  with each other, whereas, the protein sequence similarities between gene pairs ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % in mapkk family. however, most of the homologous mapkkk gene pairs showed lower similarities compared to those of mapk and mapkk family genes. given that the number of mapk and mapkk members are much less than that of mapkkks  <cit> , it is suggested that mapk and mapkk genes tend to be more conserved in evolution than mapkkks in plant.

phylogenetic relationship and conserved domain analysis
to further characterize the mapk cascade genes, unrooted phylogenetic trees were produced by aligning the full-length protein sequences of all  <dig> csmapks,  <dig> csmapkks, and  <dig> csmapkkks using the neighbor-joining  method. plant mapk genes have diverged into four major subfamilies  based on their phosphorylation motifs and the phylogenetic relationships of their amino acid sequences  <cit> . similarly, all the csmapks were also classified into groups a, b, c and d , furthermore, all the csmapks of groups a, b, and c harbor the tey  motif at the phosphorylation site, whereas the members of group d contain a tdy  motif and form a more distant clade, which is consistent with those in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . moreover, those csmapks belonging to group d have an extended c-terminal region compared with the other three groups , which is also present in arabidopsis and b, distachyon  <cit> . likewise, csmapkks were divided into four groups, namely, the a, b, c, and d subfamilies, which are consistent with the mapkks in arabidopsis, rice, b. distachyon and canola  . all the csmapkks contained a kinase domain, adenosinetriphosphate  binding site, and serine/threonine protein kinase active site. in particular, a proline-rich region and a long c-terminal region were found in the members of group b, such as csmkk <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis and domain organization of cucumber mapks. a the unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated based on the amino acid sequences by the nj method using mega  <dig>  bootstrap supports from  <dig> replicates are indicated at each branch. the members of each subfamily are indicated with the same color. b domain organization was analyzed by scanning the protein sequences for the presence of known motifs and domains with plantsp. different subgroups of csmapks are represented by the capital letter a-d

the mapkkk gene family in plants is usually divided into three categories, namely mekk, raf, and zik subfamily  <cit> . similarly, the csmapkkk genes in cucumber were clustered into three groups   corresponding to other plants  <cit> . all the csmapkkk proteins have a kinase domain, and most of them have a serine/threonine protein kinase active site. in the cucumber raf subfamily, most of the proteins have a long n-terminal regulatory domain and c-terminal kinase domain. by contrast, majority of the members in the zik subfamily have an n-terminal kinase domain. however, members of the mekk subfamily have a less conserved protein structure, whose kinase domain is located either at the c- or n-terminal or in the central part of the protein. a nls-bp region functioned as a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and was found to be distributed among the members of all the three subfamilies. however, an ubiquitin interaction motif and act domain were only present in csraf <dig> and csraf <dig>  respectively , which are involved in the regulation of a wide range of metabolic enzymes by responding to amino acid concentrations. interestingly, all the results were consistent with the previous findings in arabidopsis, rice, and tomato  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis  and domain organization  of cucumber mapkkks. for other details, see fig. 1




multiple sequence alignment and motif analysis
multiple sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid residues was conducted on the csmapk cascade gene families. data showed that all the csmapks contain a classical txy motif  which is located in the activation loop between the subdomains vii and viii of mapks  <cit> . meanwhile, the sequences in the t-loop motif were highly conserved in arabidopsis, rice and cucumber . moreover, mapks may have a cd domain which is defined as  dxxde  x and functions as a docking site for mapkks. the two adjacent acidic residues d  and e  have been shown to play critical roles in interacting with a cluster of the amino acids k  and r  in mapkks  <cit> . in the present study, five mapk genes from groups a and b  were found to possess a cd domain or modified cd domain in their c-terminal region, whereas groups c and d did not contain such a cd domain . this result was consistent with previous findings from other species, such as b. distachyon  <cit> . however, in b. napus l., the cd domain was also found to exist in group c  <cit> . meanwhile, no cd domain appeared in group d in cucumber or any other species  <cit> . the conserved motifs of the  <dig> csmapk proteins were also analyzed with the online tool meme. thus a schematic of the motifs is presented in fig. 4b and additional file  <dig>  seven out of  <dig> motifs, except  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were conserved in all the csmapk proteins. all the members identified in the same subfamily shared similar conserved motifs. for instance, besides all the conserved motifs, mapk proteins in groups a and b had specific motif  <dig> at the n-terminal region, whereas those in group d contained motifs  <dig> and  <dig> at the c-terminal region . in addition, the annotated motifs from meme were analyzed. the data revealed that eight out of  <dig> motifs  corresponded with  <dig> subdomains  of the kinase domains of mapks  <cit> .fig.  <dig> sequence alignment and motif analysis of csmapks. a multiple sequence alignment analysis of the peptides of mapk proteins in cucumber. the highlighted part shows the conserved signature motif obtained with the clustalx program. b schematic diagram of amino acid motifs of csmapks. motif analysis was analyzed by meme program online. different colors of the boxes represent different motifs in the corresponding position of each csmapk proteins. different subgroups of csmapks are represented by the capital letter a-d. the detailed information of  <dig> motifs was illustrated in additional file 6




multiple alignment of the csmapkks showed that each contained the conserved lysine  and aspartate  residues within the active site motif d  k, as well as a highly conserved phosphorylation target site within the activation loop, which has a consensus sequence s/t-x5-s/t , as previously identified in arabidopsis and some other plant mkk proteins  <cit> . comparison analysis between the protein sequences of arabidopsis, rice and cucumber uncovered that the d  k motif was highly conserved among these three species . moreover, the motif s/t-x5-s/t was conserved in subgroup a, b and c, but showed different degrees of divergences in the s/t site for four members in the d subgroup . the similar result was also found in b. distachyon  <cit> . more interestingly, it seemed that all the detected divergences were found in atmkk <dig> and its orthologs. since there were no orthologs of atmkk <dig> in cucumber, this observation was not present. further studies are needed to elucidate whether atmkk <dig> and its orthologs will display new functions compared to other mkks. the schematic overview of identified motifs of csmapkks from meme analysis revealed that  <dig> motifs were conserved in all the cucumber mapkk proteins, whereas the motif  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were group-specific. similar to the csmapks, the members in the same subfamilies contained almost all the common motifs. group a had motif  <dig> in the n-terminal and motif  <dig> in the c-terminal, whereas groups c and d  had an extra motif  <dig> in the n-terminal sequence . we also observed that csmkk <dig> had a long c-terminal region; similar findings were previously found in bnamkk <dig> and bdmkk <dig>  <cit> . the motifs annotation revealed that motif  <dig> not only had the active-site signature iihrdlkpsnllv of serine/threonine protein kinases, but also contained the phosphorylation target site s/txxxxs/t and signature vgtxxymsper, which was conserved in the catalytic domain  <cit> . however, motif  <dig> contained the protein kinase atp-binding signature that required a glycine-rich loop  for atp binding .fig.  <dig> sequence alignment and motif analysis of csmapkks. different subgroups of csmapkks are represented by the capital letter a-d. the detailed information of  <dig> motifs was illustrated in additional file  <dig>  for other details, see fig. 4




as reported in arabidopsis and other species mapkkks, the mekk subfamily in cucumber includes a conserved signature g  px  mapev. the raf-like subfamily in cucumber has the gtxx  mape signature, whereas the zik subfamily has the gtpefmape  y signature  <cit>  . multiple sequence alignments of mekk, raf and zik subfamilies from arabidopsis, rice and cucumber showed that most of mapkkks have the conserved motif . however, examinations of orthologous genes between arabidopsis and cucumber showed that some variations existed in the conserved signature of some mapkkks. for example, the valine in the typical g  fx  mapev motif of mekk subfamily is replaced by threonine and cysteine in csmapkkk <dig> and atmapkkk <dig>  respectively. interestingly, similar observations were also reported in maize  <cit>  and canola  <cit> . motif annotation showed that motif  <dig> contained a protein kinase atp-binding site, whereas motif  <dig> contained the serine/threonine protein kinase active site. in addition, motif  <dig> had a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site . motif analysis revealed that nine out of  <dig> motifs  were conserved across all the subfamilies, whereas motif  <dig> was zik subfamily-specific . the zik proteins are known as wnk  that have not been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate mapkks in plants. the ziks have been reported to be involved in internal rhythm. the zik protein wnk <dig>  in arabidopsis was involved in the control of circadian rhythms  <cit> . the wnk2/5/ <dig> proteins are found to regulate the flowering time in arabidopsis by modulating the photoperiod pathway  <cit> . recently, rice wnk <dig> was reported to be involved in internal circadian rhythm, and also differentially responded to various forms of abiotic stress  <cit> . however, the existence of such roles for cszik proteins in cucumber and specific motif  <dig> in csziks associated with their specific roles have yet to be studied.fig.  <dig> sequence alignment and motif analysis of csmapkkks. the detailed information of  <dig> motifs was illustrated in additional file  <dig>  for other details, see fig. 4




analyses of gene structures and promoter regions
gene structure divergence plays an important role in the evolution of gene families and provides additional evidence to evaluate phylogenetic relationships. therefore, the exon/intron organizations of all the mapk cascade genes in cucumber were analyzed using the gene structure display server. the number of introns in the csmapk gene family varied from  <dig> to  <dig> , which was consistent with the finding in tomato  <cit> . in the csmapkk gene family, members from subgroups c and d had no intron, whereas members in subgroups a and b had seven and eight introns, respectively . moreover, the exon/intron structures and intron phases in the mapk and mapkk gene families were conserved within the same subgroup but divergent between different subgroups. however, the numbers of introns were highly variable in csmapkkk , even in the same subfamily, and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> introns. in the mekk subfamily, eight genes had no intron, whereas csmekk <dig> and csmekk <dig> only had one intron each. however, the other genes in the mekk subgroups had  <dig> to  <dig> introns. a certain degree of conservation could be observed in the  <dig> cszik genes. apart from four genes  without any intron, the zik genes had six or seven introns, which were consistent with studies on vitis vinifera  <cit> . the raf genes showed a variable intron number that ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> . most interestingly, we found that paralogous gene pairs in these three gene families generally shared highly similar gene structures . collectively, the divergent exon-intron structures between the different phylogenetic subgroups showed that duplication events were likely to have occurred in ancient years, and the offspring genes evolved into diverse exon-intron structures to accomplish different functions in the cucumber genome. comparison the number of introns in all the mapk cascade genes in cucumber with their orthologs in arabidopsis, rice showed that most of the orthologs contained the same number of introns . it has been reported that orthology is based on evolution of introns in plants  <cit> . accordingly, our findings are consistent with previous studies and confirm that most of the orthologs of mapk cascade genes in arabidopsis, rice and cucumber are evolutionarily conserved in gene structure.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis and gene structure of csmapks in cucumber. right part illustrates the intron/exon configurations of the corresponding csmapk genes. the green boxes indicate the exons, and lines indicate the introns. gene structures of csmapks in different subgroups are shaded by different colors. different subgroups of csmapks are represented by the capital letter a-d

to further understand the potential functions and transcriptional regulation of these mapk cascade genes, 1500 bp upstream regions of the transcriptional start site  were applied to identify the cis-regulatory elements. a large amount of stress-related  and hormone-related  cis-elements were found in the putative promoter regions of the mapk cascade genes in cucumber . the existence of these cis-elements suggested that these mapk cascade genes might have potential functions in stress adaptations and various hormone signaling pathways. a large number of similar cis-elements were found in mapk cascade genes of tomato  <cit>  and b. distachyon  <cit> .

chromosomal mapping and gene duplication
to determine the chromosomal distribution and transcriptional direction of the mapk cascade genes in cucumber, blastn searches were performed against the cucumber genome database using the dna sequence of each mapk cascade gene. all the mapk cascade gene members were physically mapped to cucumber genome . they were separately distributed on each chromosome individually, and no gene clusters were found based on holub’s definition of the gene cluster  <cit> . chromosome  <dig> had the highest number of mapk cascade genes , whereas chromosome  <dig> only had four genes . moreover, the distribution of the three gene families was not random in cucumber chromosomes. for example, nine mapk genes were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  but chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> did not contain mapk genes. interestingly, all the csmapkk genes were present on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  although the csmapkkks were distributed over all the seven chromosomes, the number on each chromosome differed, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> chromosomal distributions and gene duplications of csmapks, csmapkks and csmapkkks in cucumber genome. dotted lines connect different mapk, mapkk, or mapkkk genes that are present as duplicated gene pairs. triangles indicate the upward or downward direction of transcription



gene duplication events, including tandem and segmental duplications, are thought to have important functions in the expansion of the mapk, mapkk, and mapkkk gene families  <cit> . in this study, tandem and segmental duplication events in the csmapk, csmapkk, and csmapkkk gene families were investigated using the method reported by gu et al.  <cit> . in general, we detected nine segments and no tandem duplication events in the cucumber mapk, mapkk and mapkkk gene families, namely, two in csmapks, one in csmapkk, and six in the csmapkkk gene family. these genes concerned all the chromosomes, except chromosome  <dig> . the number of gene duplication events that occurred in the csmapk, csmapkk, and csmapkkk gene families were much fewer than those in other plants, such as rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , grape  <cit> , and b. distachyon  <cit> . the recently reported whole-genome duplication event was absent and only a few tandem and segmental duplications have been shown to exist in the cucumber genome  <cit> . these phenomena may partly account for the small number of gene duplication events in the cucumber mapk cascade gene families.

to elucidate the mechanisms of gene divergence after duplication of the mapk cascade gene families in cucumber, the ratio of non-synonymous substitution rates  and synonymous substitution rates  was calculated. this ratio reflects the selective pressure acting on the protein. generally, ka/ks <  <dig> indicates negative or purifying selection; ka/ks =  <dig> indicates neutral selection; and ka/ks >  <dig> indicates positive selection  <cit> . in this study, the values of ka/ks for the nine duplicated orthologous gene pairs were all lower than  <dig> , which indicated that the mapk cascade genes from cucumber had mainly experienced purifying selection pressure after the segmental duplications. these results demonstrated that functions of the duplicated gene pairs in the csmapk, csmapkk, and csmapkkk gene families did not diverge as much from each other during subsequent evolution.

evolutionary patterns and divergence of mapk cascade genes in angiosperms
to reveal the evolutionary relationships of the three gene families in angiosperms, we further explored the duplication and diversification of mapk cascade genes after the divergence of the dicots and monocots . the sequences from two dicotyledonous plants  and two monocotyledonous crops  were obtained to compare the duplication and divergence of these three gene families with that of cucumber. the number of cucumber genes in the three gene families was lower than that of the other angiosperms . previous studies revealed that arabidopsis, rice, maize, and tomato have  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mapks and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mapkks, respectively  <cit> , as well as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mapkkk genes, respectively  <cit> . however, the cucumber genome only encodes  <dig> mapks,  <dig> mapkks, and  <dig> mapkkks . moreover, in these three gene families, most of these genes were single-copy and/or located as a singleton. huang et al.  <cit>  reported that cucumber has seven pairs of chromosomes and a haploid genome of 367 mb that encodes approximately  <dig>   <dig> genes; its genome is much smaller than that of maize   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> . however, the size of cucumber genome was similar with that of rice   <cit> , and three times that of arabidopsis   <cit> . although the differences between the genome size and total number of predicted protein-encoding genes among the five sequenced plant species were apparent , the number of mapk cascade genes did not increase or decrease proportionally. similar phenomena have been reported for other gene families in cucumber, such as wrky  <cit>  and nbs  <cit> . based previous reports  <cit> , this phenomenon can be explained by the absence of the recent whole genome duplication events in cucumber genome. another possible explanation is the limited number of segmental and tandem duplications in this genome  <cit> .

to further investigate the molecular evolution and phylogenetic relationships among mapks, mapkks, and mapkkks in angiosperms, unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the full-length protein sequences of  <dig> mapks,  <dig> mapkks, and  <dig> mapkkks sequences from cucumber, arabidopsis, tomato, maize, and rice . the phylogenetic tree revealed that mapks and mapkks in angiosperm clearly belonged to four distinct subgroups  . meanwhile, the mapkkks formed three subfamilies, namely, raf, mekk, and zik . all the subgroups or subfamilies in mapks, mapkks, or mapkkks contained members from all five species .

expression profiles in different tissues or organs
increasing evidence has shown that mapk cascade genes are widely involved in the growth and development of higher plants. in arabidopsis, mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> play important roles in anther cell differentiation and normal anther lobe formation  <cit> . meanwhile, atmpk <dig> is required for male-specific meiotic cytokinesis  <cit> . the mapk cascade yda-mkk4/mkk5-mpk3/mpk <dig> regulates arabidopsis inflorescence architecture by promoting localized cell proliferation  <cit> . atmpk <dig> has been demonstrated to be involved in seed formation and the modulation of lateral and primary root development  <cit> . another important arabidopsis mapk cascade mkk9-mpk <dig> plays an important role in leaf senescence  <cit> . gmmpk <dig> and gmmpk <dig> regulate plant growth and development in soybean  <cit> . npk <dig> in nicotiana has been suggested to regulate cell size, cytokinesis, and plant growth  <cit> . duan et al.  <cit>  identified osmkk <dig> as a factor for grain size in rice, and suggested a possible link between the brassinosteroids  and mapk pathways during grain growth. however, as of this writing, the involvement of mapk cascades in cucumber has not been demonstrated in the regulation of plant growth and development.

to gain insight into the temporal and spatial transcription patterns and putative functions of csmapk cascade genes in cucumber growth and development, qrt-pcr was performed to analyze the transcription levels in various tissues or organs, including the root, stem, leaf, flower, and fruit of plants. given the high similarity of the nucleotide sequences, only  <dig> csmapks,  <dig> csmapkks, and  <dig> csmapkkks were selected for expression analysis . the expression levels of these genes are clustered and presented in heatmaps . the results revealed high alterations in transcript abundance among different mapk cascade genes in cucumber. all the mapk cascade members were expressed in at least one organ. several proteins did not show striking differences in their expression levels among different organs or tissues. however, a small number of genes  presented very low expression in all the tested organs . specifically, csmpk4- <dig> and csmpk <dig> showed preferential expression patterns in the fruit and stem, respectively. similarly, csraf <dig> and cszik <dig> of the csmapkkk gene family were predominantly expressed in the root, whereas cszik <dig> had a relatively high expression level in the stem . therefore, these genes may mainly function in organ- or tissue-specific development in cucumber. notably, csmpk4- <dig>  the duplicated gene of csmpk4- <dig>  exhibited relatively high transcript abundance in the stem and male flowers, suggesting the different expression patterns between duplicated gene pairs . similar results were found in other duplicated gene pairs. for example, csmkk2- <dig> of the csmapkk gene family was expressed in all tested organs with relatively higher abundance, whereas csmkk2- <dig> was mainly expressed in the root, stem, and fruit . although the duplicated gene pairs had higher similarity in terms of their amino acid and nucleotide sequences, they may not be involved in the same pathway or do not have similar functions. meanwhile, several paralogs showed highly similar expression patterns. for example, csmekk4-1/csmekk4- <dig> and csraf34/csraf41-1/csraf41- <dig> demonstrated subfunctionalization in the course of evolution. interestingly, most mapk cascade genes in cucumber presented similar expression profiles with their homologs in arabidopsis or rice  <cit> . for example, csmpk13/atmpk <dig> and csraf10/osmapkkk <dig> were expressed in nearly all the detected organs/tissues with low abundance , suggesting they might have conserved functions retained from the same ancestral gene  <cit> . however, some orthologous genes displayed quite different expression patterns among cucumber, arabidopsis and rice. for instance, csmpk <dig> had higher expression in stem than that of other organs , whereas osmpk <dig> was constitutively expressed in nearly all the organs with high abundance  <cit> . the divergences in expression profiles between paralogs or orthologs revealed that some of them may acquire new functions after duplication in the evolutionary process.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of csmapks in different organs/tissues using qrt-pcr analysis. r: roots, s: stems, l: leaves, m-fl: male flowers, f-fl: female flowers, fr: fruits. all samples were run in triplicate and the data were normalized relative to the ef1a  related protein transcript levels. the expression levels of genes are presented in heatmap using fold-change values transformed to log <dig> format by mev <dig> . the color scale and log <dig> values  are shown at the bottom of heatmap. genes were clustered according to their expression profiles

expression profiles under various stress conditions and plant hormone treatments
numerous members of the mapk pathways have been well characterized in terms of their response to various biotic and abiotic stresses in plants  <cit> . an cascade with mekk <dig>  mkk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and/or mpk <dig> in arabidopsis has been shown to respond to salt, drought, and cold stress  <cit> . the mekk1-mpk <dig> cascade is an essential component of ros metabolism  <cit> , whereas the mkk1-mpk <dig> cascade is involved in h2o <dig> metabolism  <cit> . recent studies demonstrated that mapk proteins in cucumber participate in the signal transduction of stress response. a trichoderma-induced mapk  was involved in fungal defense responses  <cit> , whereas csnmapk regulated no3− stress  <cit> , ros, and osmotic adjustment under salt stress  <cit> . in the present study, we conducted qrt-pcr analyses to examine the expression levels of the csmapk cascade genes in response to three different abiotic stresses  and one biotic stress . all the  <dig> detected csmapk cascade genes showed differential expression patterns in response to more than one stress . all the csmapks were downregulated after p. cubensis treatment whereas the majorities  were downregulated after cold treatment. however, most of the csmapks were upregulated under heat stress, except csmpk <dig> and csmpk <dig>  meanwhile, all the csmapks were initially downregulated for the first  <dig> d before they were significantly upregulated after drought treatment . interestingly, similar expression patterns were observed for csmapkkks in the present study . the expression levels of csmapkks irregularly increased or decreased following after cold, heat, drought, or p. cubensis treatment . for example, csmkk <dig> transcripts decreased in abundance when plants were subjected to cold, drought, and p. cubensis stress. however, the csmkk <dig> transcripts exhibited a pronounced increase at the last time point , which was induced by heat stress. by contrast, the expression pattern of csmkk <dig> was dramatically different from that of csmkk <dig> or any other csmapkks. the expression profiles of the csmapk cascade duplicated gene pairs were also compared. most of the detected duplicated gene pairs , excluding csmekk2-1/csmekk2- <dig>  showed similar expression profiles under cold, heat, drought, or p. cubensis treatment . that is worth mentioning that some homologous genes among cucumber, arabidopsis and rice showed quite different expression patterns under the same stress conditions. for example, atmpk <dig> was significantly up-regulated whereas csmpk <dig> was markedly down-regulated under the cold stress conditions. moreover, osmkk <dig> was up-regulated under the drought and cold stress conditions, while csmpkk <dig> was down-regulated under the same stress conditions  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of csmapks under abiotic and biotic stress treatment in cucumber by qrt-pcr analysis in heatmap. details of the treatments are reported in materials and methods

several examples implicate plant mapks in hormone signaling by regulating phytohormone synthesis and mediating antagonistic or synergistic effects between different hormones  <cit> . the mkk3/mpk <dig> module was proposed to participate in jasmonic acid  signaling  <cit> . the relationship of mapk signaling pathways and abscisic acid  in plant abiotic stress responses was recently characterized  <cit> . unfortunately, studies on the cross-talk between csmapk pathways and hormone signaling in cucumber have been limited. in the present study, changes in the transcription of csmapk cascade genes in response to the plant hormones ja and aba were compared . the transcript levels of most csmapk cascade genes considerably varied after exogenous ja and aba treatment, thereby implying their involvements in plant hormone signaling. however, csmpk <dig> transcript abundance decreased after exogenous ja treatment, but increased after exogenous aba treatment . therefore, csmpk <dig> may be associated with different biological pathways in response to ja and aba. interestingly, a previous study showed that the expression levels of the mpk <dig> gene from rice were upregulated in response to treatment with ja  <cit> , which indicated the different roles of mpk <dig> in cucumber and rice ja signaling. lu et al.  <cit>  found that mpk <dig> is activated by aba in arabidopsis seedlings, which implied that csmpk <dig> might play a role similar to atmpk <dig> during aba signaling. evidence of the involvement of mapkkks in cucumber stress and hormonal response is limited. the known functions of csmapk cascade proteins or predicted biological roles based on the experimentally characterized mapk cascade genes in arabidopsis were summarized in additional file  <dig>  further analysis is required to elucidate the exact functions of these cucumber mapk cascade genes in response to various stress and plant hormones. our aforementioned observations provide the first genome-wide survey on the expression patterns of specific cucumber mapks, mapkks, and mapkkks in various biotic and abiotic conditions, as well as plant hormone signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first to provide a full list of the mapks, mapkks, and mapkkks in cucumber. a genome-wide search of the cucumber protein database by blastp identified  <dig> mapks,  <dig> mapkks, and  <dig> mapkkks in cucumber. est hits or full-length cdna sequences supported the existence of these genes. csmapks and csmapkks were grouped into four subgroups , whereas csmapkkks were divided into three subfamilies . the conserved domains/motifs, phylogenetic relationships, and gene structures strongly supported the identity of each subgroup. our results demonstrated that segment duplications could be the main factors influencing the expansion of the mapk cascade gene families in cucumber. the expression profiles of mapk cascade genes in various organs or tissues were discussed, as well as their responses to stresses and exogenous plant hormones. most of the selected genes were expressed in all the analyzed organs, whereas some genes were preferentially expressed in one or more specific organs. furthermore, a majority of the mapk cascade genes could be induced by biotic and abiotic stress treatment; most of the genes could interact with plant hormones, such as aba and ja, during plant development or in defense pathways. therefore, the information generated in this work provides a significant foundation for further investigation of the regulatory mechanism of the cucumber mapk cascade in response to extracellular or intracellular stimuli for various biological functions.
