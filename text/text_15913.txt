BACKGROUND
lipopeptides  are biosurfactants produced by a variety of bacterial genera, including pseudomonas and bacillus  <cit> . lps are composed of an  oligopeptide moiety linked to a fatty acid tail  <cit> . in beneficial pseudomonas strains, lps play a role in colonization of seeds  <cit>  and roots  <cit> , in defense against competing microorganisms and predatory protozoa  <cit> , and in swarming motility and biofilm formation  <cit> . lp biosynthesis is governed by large multi-modular nonribosomal peptide synthetases  via a thiotemplate process  <cit> . compared to our understanding of lp biosynthesis, relatively little is known about the genetic networks involved in the perception of external signals and the signal transduction pathways that drive transcription of the lp biosynthesis genes. here we focus on the regulation of lp biosynthesis in the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium pseudomonas fluorescens ss <dig>  strain ss <dig> produces the lp massetolide a, a 9-amino-acid cyclic peptide linked to 3-hydroxydecanoic acid  <cit> . massetolide a is produced in the early exponential growth phase and is essential for swarming motility and biofilm formation of strain ss <dig>  <cit> . its biosynthesis is governed by three nrps genes, designated massa, massb, and massc  <cit> .

to identify the genetic networks underlying regulation of massetolide biosynthesis, p. fluorescens strain ss <dig> was subjected to random mutagenesis. screening of a library of approximately  <dig>  random plasposon mutants resulted in the identification of four new regulatory genes, namely phgdh, dnak, prtr and clpa  <cit> . in this recent study, we focused our functional analyses on phgdh, dnak and prtr, but not on clpa. independently from this work, clpp had been previously identified as a regulator of massetolide biosynthesis in p. fluorescens ss <dig>  <cit> . hence, the aims of the present study were to i) study the role of clpa in regulation of massetolide biosynthesis, and ii) analyse the clpa regulon at the transcriptional and proteome level in order to narrow down the role of clpp in regulating massetolide biosynthesis.

the atp-dependent serine protease clpp is highly conserved in eubacteria  <cit>  and has diverse functions, including intracellular proteolysis. clpp associates with different atpases that either recognize protein substrates directly or, alternatively, interact with substrates via so-called adaptor proteins  <cit> . substrates are then unfolded and translocated to the proteolytic chamber of the clpp protease  <cit> . clpp consists of two heptameric rings that form a barrel-shaped proteolytic core with the active sites hidden in an interior chamber  <cit> . the atpases of clpp that have been studied in detail in various bacterial genera include clpx, clpb, hslu and clpa  <cit> . in strain ss <dig>  site-directed mutagenesis of clpx did not affect massetolide biosynthesis  <cit> , suggesting that clpx does not act as the chaperone of clpp in the regulation of massetolide biosynthesis. therefore, the focus of our present study is on the role of the clpap complex in the regulation of massetolide biosynthesis. clpa is formed as a hexameric chaperone ring complex and selects the target proteins for clpp to degrade based on the n-end rule  <cit> . either misfolded or specifically tagged proteins are targeted by clpa  <cit> . to unravel the cellular substrates of the clpap complex in e.coli, a proteomics approach  <cit>  was adopted which revealed that several proteins involved in metabolism and energy production, cell motility and transport are potential cellular targets. in our study, we combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses for both clpa and clpp mutants to identify putative substrates of the clpap complex with the ultimate goal to further elucidate the genetic regulation of massetolide biosynthesis in p. fluorescens.

RESULTS
role of clpa in lipopeptide biosynthesis in p. fluorescens ss101
in p. fluorescens ss <dig>  the clpa gene is 2271 bp with  <dig> to 98% identity to homologs in other pseudomonas genomes . based on the drop collapse assay, a mutation in the clpa gene abolishes massetolide production . rp-hplc analysis confirmed that the clpa mutant indeed did not produce detectable levels of massetolide a or its derivatives . complementation of the clpa mutant with the stable vector pme6031-clpa restored massetolide production to wild-type level, whereas the empty-vector control did not . massetolide biosynthesis is known to be essential for swarming motility of strain ss <dig>  <cit> . the clpa mutant was not able to swarm on soft agar  and this phenotype was restored by complementation with pme6031-clpa . in contrast to a mutation in clpp, no effects on growth were observed for the clpa mutant . collectively, these results indicated that clpa is required for massetolide biosynthesis in p. fluorescens ss <dig> figure  <dig>

transcriptome analysis
to further investigate the genetic basis for clpap-mediated regulation of massetolide biosynthesis, whole-genome transcriptome analyses were performed for the clpa  and clpp  mutants. given the differences in growth kinetics between the mutants and wild-type ss <dig> , cells were harvested in the exponential growth phase . in the clpa mutant, transcription of  <dig> and  <dig> genes increased and decreased, respectively, by at least 2-fold  . apart from the massetolide biosynthesis genes, several of the differentially regulated genes were associated with energy production and conversion, amino acid transport and metabolism, cell wall and membrane biogenesis and pilus assembly. several of the other differentially regulated genes could not be assigned to clusters of orthologous groups . two pili gene clusters were significantly down-regulated in the clpa mutant. the first was the csu gene cluster  which is known to affect biofilm formation in acinetobacter baumannii  <cit> . the second was the type ivb pili gene cluster pflss101_0648- <dig> and the regulator pprb . in pseudomonas aeruginosa, type ivb pili are required for adhesion to abiotic surfaces and to eukaryotic cells  <cit> . further experiments will be needed to explore the functions of both pili gene clusters in p. fluorescens ss <dig> 

with  <dig> and  <dig> genes significantly up and down regulated, respectively, the clpp mutation had a much bigger impact, as expected, on the overall gene expression in strain ss <dig> than a mutation in clpa . combining the transcriptome data of the clpa and clpp mutants revealed that seven and thirteen genes were up and down-regulated, respectively, in both mutants . these include the massetolide biosynthesis genes massa, massb, massc and their flanking genes consisting of the luxr-type transcriptional regulator massar and the efflux-associated genes pflss101_ <dig>  pflss101_ <dig> and pflss101_ <dig>  among the genes differentially regulated in both clpa and clpp mutants were also the thif_moeb gene cluster  as well as genes encoding a fad-binding domain protein  and an auto-inducer-binding luxr-type transcriptional regulator  . expression of the previously identified regulatory genes of massetolide biosynthesis, phgdh, dnak, and prtr  <cit> , was not affected in the clpa and clpp mutants. this suggests that, at the transcriptional level, clpap-mediated regulation of massetolide biosynthesis operates downstream or operates independently from these other regulatory genes.figure  <dig>

proteome analysis
total cell proteomic analyses were performed to further decipher the potential cellular substrates and target proteins of clpap . the culture conditions and ‘harvest’ time of the bacterial cells  were identical to those used in the transcriptome analyses described above. it should be noted that the clpap system is a degradative protease thereby complicating the interpretation of proteomics data. while transcriptomics can validly argue that mrnas  are up- or down-regulated, the higher abundance of a particular protein in the clpa and or clpp mutants can also be due to an inherent up- or down-regulation by other modulated pathways. hence, the proteomics results described below should be interpreted with caution.

proteins differentially expressed in the clpa mutant or clpp mutant
itraq-based proteome analyses allowed the identification of a total of  <dig> proteins in the clpa mutant :  <dig> proteins were significantly up-regulated  while  <dig> were down-regulated . gap <dig> , encoding a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was up-regulated in the clpa mutant, which was consistent with the earlier report  <cit>  that reported a similar gapa protein as one of the substrates of clpap in e. coli. all three protein groups from the ‘intracellular trafficking and secretion’ cog category were up-regulated in the clpa mutant, including seca, secb, and the tol-pal system protein tolb .

in line with the findings in e. coli  <cit> , we observed that the cell division protein ftsz and the isocitrate lyase acea were up-regulated in the clpp mutant , suggesting that these proteins might be substrates of clpp in strain ss <dig>  moreover, we detected five transcriptional regulators and five chaperons that were uniquely up-regulated in the clpp mutant . one of the up-regulated transcriptional regulators was mvat , which is known to regulate the biosynthesis of specific secondary metabolites in the rhizobacterium pseudomonas protegens cha <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the heat shock proteins dnak and dnaj, the chaperonin gros, grol and the chaperon htpg were significantly up-regulated in the clpp mutant. also chea, a histidine kinase that mediates chemotaxis signaling events in many prokaryotes  <cit> , was  <dig> -fold up-regulated, suggesting it may be a substrate of clpp in strain ss <dig> table  <dig>

proteins differentially expressed in both clpa and clpp mutants
in both clpa and clpp mutants,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were up- and down-regulated, respectively . the most up-regulated was cspd , a gene encoding one of the cold shock protein cspa family members in e. coli. cspd is known to be induced by nutritional deprivation  <cit> . moreover, the response regulator cbrb and the transcriptional regulator gntr were up-regulated in both mutants. the cbra-cbrb two-component system is known to control the utilization of different carbon and nitrogen sources in p. aeruginosa  <cit>  and affects chemotaxis, stress tolerance and biofilm development in pseudomonas putida  <cit> . gntr is a transcriptional regulator that controls antibiotic production in both streptomyces and serratia  <cit> . none of these proteins and their corresponding genes were found in genome-wide screening for massetolide-deficient mutants, except dnak  <cit> . in our proteome analyses, the dnak protein was found at higher concentrations in the clpp mutant and its chaperon dnaj protein was up-regulated in both clpa and clpp mutants. given that dnak and dnaj also regulate putisolvin biosynthesis in p. putida  <cit> , our results suggest that clpap regulates lp biosynthesis in multiple pseudomonas species at least in part, via dnak and dnaj .table  <dig>

tca cycle proteins were expressed differently in both clpp and clpa mutants
our proteome analyses also revealed that several proteins from the tca cycle were differentially expressed in both the clpa and the clpp mutants . five proteins were down-regulated and two were up-regulated in the clpa mutant. similar numbers of down-regulated  and up-regulated  proteins were found in the clpp mutant . in the tca cycle, pcka  encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase atp and transfers oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate. this protein was  <dig>  up- and  <dig>  down-regulated in the clpa and clpp mutants, respectively. mqo_ <dig> , a malate quinone oxidoreductase, was up-regulated in both mutants. malate quinone oxidoreductase is known to be essential for growth on ethanol or acetate in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . it is also required for virulence of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig> on arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . its function in p. fluorescens ss <dig>  however, is not yet known.

CONCLUSIONS
clpa is a chaperon protein that is highly conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes  <cit> . together with the serine protease clpp, it plays an important role in intracellular refolding and degradation of proteins, an essential process for the viability and growth of cells. in this study, we cloned and sequenced clpa from the plant growth-promoting bacterium p. fluorescens strain ss <dig> and showed that clpa plays an important role in the regulation of massetolide biosynthesis. the combined results of the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that the clpap complex regulates massetolide biosynthesis via the pathway-specific luxr-type transcriptional regulator massar, the heat shock proteins dnak and dnaj and via proteins involved in the tca cycle. these findings extend our previous regulatory model for lp biosynthesis in p. fluorescens ss <dig>  which, to a large extent, may also apply to the regulatory networks of lp biosynthesis in other pseudomonas species and strains.
