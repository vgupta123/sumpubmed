BACKGROUND
peripheral arterial occlusive disease  is a major manifestation of atherosclerosis and is commonly found in elderly patients. epidemiological studies have shown that pad affects  <dig> to  <dig> million adults in the united states  <cit> . most patients with pad are asymptomatic. the disease is primarily diagnosed by an ankle brachial index  <  <dig> . the most common symptom of mild-to-moderate pad is intermittent claudication, which is present in about one third of symptomatic patients  <cit> . in addition to leg symptoms, patients with pad are at an increased risk for developing new coronary events and eventually death from cardiovascular disease. although conventional procedures such as stents, arterectomies, angioplasty, and bypass surgery have been successful in improving clinical symptoms of pad to a large extent  <cit> , ultimately elimination of the disease may require sophisticated protocols of pharmaceutical interventions, which may depend on better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the disease.

previous studies have implicated the involvement of the immune system in atherosclerosis formation and progression. animal models have been used to test the contributions of components of the immune system  <cit> . cellular involvement of macrophages was found to be important in the formation and progression of atherosclerosis in animal models  <cit> . in addition, various immune-related genes have been examined in an atherosclerosis animal model, and genes such as cxcr <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcr <dig> and cxcl16/scavenger receptor have been shown to be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models  <cit> . in humans, many immune cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, mast cells, and t cells are found in atherosclerosis  <cit> . these findings suggest that the immune system plays important roles in atherogenesis. however, data available to date are primarily derived from studies of atherosclerosis in the coronary or/and the carotid arteries, whereas data derived from clinical samples of pad appear to be particularly limited.

in the past decade, microarray analysis using high-throughput screening technology has emerged as an important tool to study gene expression patterns and to study molecular events in complex diseases  <cit> . in this study, affymetrix genechips were used to perform gene expression profiling of femoral atherosclerotic lesions to fully characterize the peripheral arterial wall gene expression patterns associated with atherosclerosis. by statistical analysis, hundreds of known and novel genes were identified that differentially express in pad. genes involved in immune/inflammatory responses appeared to be significantly enriched in the set of genes up-regulated in different stages of pad. to further examine the expression patterns of individual genes in the context of particular biological or molecular pathways, gene functional enrichment was performed using gene ontology and kegg database. the results revealed that immune system-related categories and pathways were significantly overrepresented in the progression of the disease, suggesting that up-regulation of immune/inflammatory genes may be critical components of the disease progression expression signature associated with atherosclerosis. these findings may provide new insights and foster a better understanding of the mechanism of pad.

RESULTS
patient classification and outcome
histological characterization of  <dig> collected peripheral artery samples was conducted based on the criteria of the american heart association. of these samples,  <dig> were classified as grade iii , one as grade iv and fourteen as grade v . among them,  <dig> intermediate lesions samples  and  <dig> advanced lesions samples  had rna of sufficient quality and quantity for hybridization. representative images of the different stages are shown in figure  <dig>  further details of these  <dig> samples are listed in table  <dig>  as shown, there was no significant difference between the intermediate lesions and the advanced lesions group except for indications of hypertension. in the intermediate lesions group,  <dig> patients  presented with hypertension, while  <dig> hypertensive patients  were found in the advanced lesions group.

differentially regulated genes in intermediate lesions
identifying differential expression genes was achieved for different stages by using significance analysis of microarrays  with a false discovery rate  of  <dig> %. comparative analysis revealed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in intermediate lesions when compared to normal femoral arteries, of which  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes between intermediate lesions and normal femoral arteries are shown in figure 2a. notably, in the up-regulated genes, up to  <dig> genes have been reported to be involved in immune response, such as hla-dqb <dig>  hla-drb <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  c1qb and tlr <dig> . in addition, a large number of genes known to encode proteins crucial for proteolysis  and cell proliferation  appeared to be significantly changed. since btg <dig> and btg <dig> are known to be involved in anti-proliferation activities, it can be of interest to further investigate their potential roles in pad in detail. mcm <dig> is heavily involved in chromosomal stability. among the down-regulated genes, those involved in calcium signaling , transport , metabolism , and protein amino acid dephosphorylation  were found to be significantly down-regulated. the gene ontology functional categories in which intermediate lesions are overrepresented are illustrated in table  <dig> and additional data . as shown in the table, the most significant biological process categories in the up-regulated genes are immune response, humoral immune response, inflammatory response, and t cell proliferation . for down-regulated genes, the significant ones mainly represent metabolism and catabolism-related categories.

go analysis was applied to differentially expressed genes in intermediate lesions compared with normal controls. similar significant categories were not included to reduce redundancy. the first half of the table indicates categories highly significant for up-regulated genes; the second half of the table shows categories highly significant for down-regulated genes. calculated p-values and z-scores for each category are shown. the corresponding cell component categories and molecular function categories are available in additional data 

differentially regulated genes in advanced lesions
when advanced lesions were compared to normal femoral arteries,  <dig> genes were identified, of which  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . the list of the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes is shown in figure 2b. interestingly, up to  <dig> genes involved in the immune system response, such as ccr <dig>  cx3cr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  were found to be up-regulated in advanced lesion , which might suggest that these immune/inflammatory related genes could serve as expression signatures characterizing different stages of pad. in addition, genes constituting a major portion of the vascular extracellular matrix were significantly up-regulated in advanced lesions, including col1a <dig>  col3a <dig>  col1a <dig>  col5a <dig>  col6a <dig>  col6a <dig> and lamb <dig>  suggesting that these genes could be involved in the femoral artery occlusion in pad. go analysis further confirmed the above findings, by highlighting categories of immune response, humoral immune response, inflammatory response and i-kappab kinase/nf-kappab cascades  . for down-regulated genes, those involved in ion transport  and protein folding  appeared to be the most significantly down-regulated in advanced lesions. go analysis showed that the most significant categories for down-regulated genes were response to protein stimulus, rna metabolism, and protein folding .

go analysis was applied to differentially expressed genes in advanced lesions compared with normal controls. some other selected categories are shown. the first half of the table indicates categories highly significant for up-regulated genes; the second half of the table shows categories highly significant for down-regulated genes. calculated p-values and z-scores for each category are shown. the corresponding cell component categories and molecular function categories are available in additional data 

in parallel, further data analysis revealed that many genes were over-represented in both intermediate and advanced lesions vs. normal controls. of these genes,  <dig> were found to be commonly up-regulated and  <dig> were found to be commonly down-regulated . the list of commonly up-regulated genes is available . some of these overlapping genes, such as ctsb, ccr <dig>  alox <dig>  and spp <dig>  have been previously reported to play important roles in atherogenesis  <cit> . accordingly, these commonly regulated genes can therefore be important for the progression of pad. in contrast, a much larger number of genes appear to be characteristically expressed in either intermediate lesions or advanced lesions, which may therefore serve as stage-specific signatures of pad.

differential gene expression in disease progression
intermediate lesions and advanced lesions represent different stages in disease progression of pad. identification of genes that exhibit characteristic expression patterns in different stages may provide information relevant to the progression of pad. for this reason, expression profiles of normal arteries, intermediate lesions and advanced lesions were analyzed by the sam multiclass method. out of this analysis,  <dig> genes appeared to be differentially expressed in the progression of pad with a fdr< <dig> % . hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the expression patterns of the genes could be assigned to three major groups . the first group represents those genes commonly expressed in both intermediate and advanced lesions . go terms indicate that these genes are mainly involved in the immune response, inflammatory response, cellular defense and various signaling pathways . these results further support the notion that the immune system may play an important role in the progression of pad. the second group represents specifically down-regulated genes in advanced lesions . go terms indicate that these genes are primarily involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, multicellular organism development and protein folding . genes in the third group are represented by those down-regulated in both intermediate lesions and advanced lesions . go terms indicate that these genes are mainly involved in neurogenesis, protein modification, rna splicing, and blood pressure regulation . in addition, we have performed data analysis restricted to male subjects. up to 85% genes identified in male subjects are the same as those identified in the total samples , which suggests that the potential gender-biases is minimal. taken together, genes commonly up-regulated in intermediate and advanced stages are typically represented by those involved in immune and inflammatory responses, implicating enhanced immune response activities during the progression of the disease, whereas down-regulated genes in the both disease stages are primarily represented by those involved in various aspects of cell proliferation and differentiation.

go analysis was applied to differentially expressed genes in each cluster group. some selected categories are shown. the calculated p-values and z-scores for each category are shown. the detailed go results are provided in the additional data .

validation of gene transcription by real-time pcr
real-time pcr is still the gold standard for quantitative analysis of mrna. in order to validate the microarray results, rt- pcr was carried out on the same set of samples that were analyzed by the microarray approach. the results were highly correlated with those from the array data. . representative rt-pcr results of  <dig> genes are shown in figure  <dig> 

transcription factors enrichment analysis
transcription factors appear to play important roles in the development or progression of atherosclerosis  <cit> . to address whether specific transcription factors are involved in the regulation of genes associated with the progression of pad, we conducted a transcription factor binding site enrichment study by analyzing cross-species conserved binding sites in promoter regions of genes differentially regulated during progression of pad. through the fisher exact test, binding sites of transcription factor ap- <dig> and creb appeared to be significantly enriched . ap- <dig> is a transcription factor known to be involved in various cellular processes. in atherosclerosis, it has been reported in gene regulation of microphages, vascular smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells  <cit> . in disease progression, ap- <dig> was enriched to regulate expression of  <dig> genes . the enrichment of ap <dig> binding sites in regulated genes associated with pad progression may therefore suggest an important role played by this transcription factor in the development of pad. through literature mining, indeed, some of the potential targets of ap <dig> appear to be previously reported as target genes of ap- <dig>  <cit> . creb is a member of the leucine zipper family of dna binding proteins. this transcription factor binds as a homodimer to the camp-responsive element and induces transcription of genes in response to hormonal stimulation  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes were recognized as potential targets of creb . although further studies are need to elucidate detailed roles played by ap <dig> and creb in pad progression, significantly enriched binding sites and highly correlated with signature genes of pad progression suggest that these two transcription factors may play critical roles in the development of pad.

pathways identification by overabundant genes
a pathway analysis database, kegg, was then applied to genes differentially regulated in intermediate and advanced lesions. several overrepresented pathways were identified, and the enriched pathways appeared not to be independent of one another, many genes involved in one pathway could be also involved in another pathway. this interaction is illustrated in figure  <dig>  and pathway abbreviations can be found in table  <dig>  as demonstrated, many immune-related pathways were significantly over-represented in intermediate and/or advanced lesions including tlr, nk, bcr, fer, app, ccc and ltem pathways. these findings, on the one hand, provide evidence supporting previous hypotheses that immune/inflammatory responses play important roles in the development of pad, and on the other hand, demonstrate that particular components of immune/inflammatory systems can be crucial for the genesis and progression of pad. for instance, tlr and nk pathways are shown to be particularly overrepresented in both intermediate lesions and advanced lesions, highlighting their functional importance in the disease. the tlr pathway is shown in figure  <dig> with the differentially regulated genes indicated.

genes identified from sam under fdr<1% were tested for overrepresentation within the pathways for the kegg under the modified fisher exact test assumption; p-value and genes involved in the pathway are provided for each pathway

protein validation of tlr <dig> expression
members of the toll receptor family are key mediators of innate immunity. they respond to various pathogen-associated stimuli and transduce complex signaling responses that are required for inflammation and for the subsequent development of adaptive immunity  <cit> . in atherosclerosis, tlr-mediated signaling cascades are observed in macrophages, mast cells and endothelial cells  <cit> . data shown in this setting demonstrate that genes involved in tlr-mediated pathway are significantly up-regulated in intermediate or advanced lesions, including tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and myd <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> have been previously reported to be significantly regulated in atherosclerosis and their functional roles have been widely investigated in atherosclerosis  <cit> . however, the expression of tlr <dig> in atherosclerosis has not been reported before. tlr <dig> mediates innate responses by recognizing oligonucleotide based  molecular patterns in endocytic compartments. our data show that it is significantly up-regulated in both intermediate and advanced lesions. western-blot analysis was performed to further validate its expression on the protein level . the function of tlr <dig> in atherogenesis is currently under further investigation.

discussion
in the present study, we first examined the gene expression profiles of pad. data analysis identified a number of genes that might be significantly correlated with different levels of pad severity. the list of differentially expressed genes in intermediate and advanced lesions contains many genes which can be important for atherosclerosis. most of these genes have not been reported to be related to atherosclerosis before. for example, map4k <dig> is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. it has been shown to specifically activate mapk8/jnk and mediate the tnf-alpha signaling pathway  <cit> . in this study, it was significantly and consistently up-regulated in both intermediate and advanced lesions.

a large multidisciplinary study is currently underway to comprehensively assess pad at multiple levels  <cit> , the goal of that study is to investigate  <dig> symptomatic patients with pad undergoing medical management with or without vascular intervention by lower extremity angioplasty/stenting or vein graft bypass, and to test the hypothesis that the systemic inflammatory response after vascular intervention influences the local milieu responsible for vascular repair and adaptation  <cit> . identification of genes through the work may be significant in the selection of candidate genes that can be investigated through these cases-control genetic epidemiology studies. our research supports the idea that immune responses play a key role in the development of pad.

in this report, immune related genes were shown to be significantly expressed during the development of pad. gene functional analysis further revealed that immune related categories and pathways were significant enriched in the different stages of pad. in these immune related genes, several genes have been shown to modulate the development of atherosclerosis in mice models. for example, igg fc receptors  play a role in activating the immune system and in maintaining peripheral tolerance. previous research suggested that fcγ receptor deficiency protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein-e knockout mice  <cit> . the results suggest that broad-range inhibitors of immune and inflammatory responses can be considered as potential targets for the treatment of pad. however, gene expression patterns of immune related genes can be different in different stages of pad. for example, in intermediate lesions, mhc class ii molecules were significantly up-regulated including hla-dma, hla-dmb, hla-dpb <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  hla-dra, hla-drb <dig> and hla-drb <dig>  mhc class ii molecules are normally restricted to a subset of antigen presenting dendritic cells, b cells, macrophages, and thymic epithelium cells  <cit> . these cells can be detected close to cd4+ t cells and present peptides to the t cells. the results suggest that there can be an ongoing immune activation in the intermediate lesions. however, mhc class ii molecules were not differentially expressed in advanced lesions, even with a higher false discovery rate, which may suggest that the hla-mediated immune activation may occur mainly in the progression stages of pad. in addition, complement molecules were also significantly up-regulated in intermediate lesions, not in advanced lesions. previous studies have implicated that activation of the complement system is probably associated with the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis  <cit> . our data thus provide direct evidence from clinical samples demonstrating that complement system mainly play a role in the development stages of pad. it is therefore conceivable that different and complex immune/inflammatory responses may take place at different stages of pad.

atherosclerosis is a systemic, multifocal disease leading to various symptoms and clinical events including cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease. our results reveal that many genes identified in the report are also expressed in coronary or carotid atherosclerotic lesions. for example, c3ar <dig> and c5r <dig> are receptors of c <dig>  and c5a respectively. a recent study shows that c3ar <dig> and c5r <dig> are expressed in human atherosclerotic coronary plaques  <cit> . double immunofluorescence staining has shown that the plaque of cells that express both c3ar and c5ar are macrophages, t cells, endothelial cells, and sub-endothelial smooth muscle cells. in addition, gene expression changes between atherosclerosis from coronary and carotid artery samples have been measured by microarray technology in recent years. one study using microarray found that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in both animal model and human coronary artery atherosclerosis disease  <cit> . our data confirmed  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes had significantly different expression in intermediate lesions and advanced lesions, respectively. moreover, these genes had expression trends similar to the ones found in our data, but our data showed higher fold-changes. in these overlapping genes,  <dig> were reported to be involved in immune response. another microarray study found that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in aortic atherosclerosis samples  <cit> . our data confirms  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes had significantly different expression in intermediate and advanced lesions , respectively. importantly, in these overlapping genes,  <dig> were reported to be involved in immune response. taken together, the results suggested that immune response is a common feature in atherosclerosis-related diseases. our microarray study differs from prior microarray studies in the array type, sample type, sample classification, and analytical techniques. nevertheless, the high level of overlapping genes suggests that there are similar molecular mechanisms in the development of peripheral arterial disease and other atherosclerosis-related diseases.

several limitations of our approach should be noted. first, hybridization-based microarrays, despite their immense potential, have inherent shortcomings related to deficient standardization of methods employed in normalization, statistical analysis, and so on  <cit> . in this study, we have attempted to limit these shortcomings by selecting subjects who were phenotypically similar to each other except for hypertension. in addition, the initial phases of data analysis, we used different normalization and statistical methods to identify differentially expressed genes. after choosing sam, we used a rigorous false discovery rate to minimize false positive results. expression patterns were validated by confirming mrna expression patterns with conventional molecular techniques. we attempted, based on current literature, to suggest a potential functional role for genes whose expression was markedly altered. second, atherosclerosis is a slow, progressive disease that may start in childhood; entirely normal arteries can only be obtained from young donors, a factor that can affect gene expression measurements. although previous research and our data analysis suggest that age had very little effect on genes, further work is needed to identify age-related genes. third, the relatively small number of patients did not allow us to assess serial changes in the disease development in more detail as would have been possible in animal models  <cit> . furthermore, we do not know to what extent the observed changes in gene expression translate into protein synthesis and function, and which genes cause atherosclerosis. future studies are needed to address these issues.

CONCLUSIONS
we first examined the gene expression profiles of pad; the results from this analysis provide an initial step towards a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying pad development. differences in immune-related responses were observable at the gene expression level. these findings may be significant for understanding the molecular basis of pad and investigating pharmacological approaches for the prevention and amelioration of atherosclerosis in pad.
