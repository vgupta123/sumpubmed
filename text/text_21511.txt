BACKGROUND
the bacterial dna polymerase iii β subunit , and the corresponding eukaryotic and archaeal proliferating cell nuclear antigen  are ring-shaped proteins that encircle double-stranded dna. they act as a processivity factor, or a sliding clamp, for a wide variety of proteins that act on dna including dna polymerases, dna ligase, endonucleases and glycosylases . for escherichia coli dna polymerase catalytic core the replication speed is increased from approximately 20 nt/s with frequent dissociation  <cit>  to approximately 750 nt/s with a processivity of >50 kb in the presence of the β-clamp  <cit> . to be loaded onto dna, the sliding clamps need the help of atp-dependent clamp loaders. clamp loaders are multi-subunit complexes where atp hydrolysis is coupled to conformational changes that enable the clamp loader to open the sliding clamp and place it on dna  <cit> . once loaded, the sliding clamp allows the binding of other polymerase subunits.

the crystal structure of a β-clamp was first determined for e. coli in  <dig>  <cit> , and after that for five other bacteria so far  <cit> . the structures show that the bacterial sliding clamp is a head-to-tail dimer  <cit> , where one of the interfaces is opened by the clamp loader to allow dna to enter the ring interior  <cit> . in eukaryotes, the pcna clamp is also ring shaped but consist of a homotrimer  <cit>  and in archaea such as sulfolobus solfataricus a heterodimer  <cit> . there are also available two structures of a sliding clamp bound to dna . in spite of the different quaternary structures and a low sequence identity of the different clamp types  <cit> , their overall shape and internal architecture with six similarly folded domains are strikingly similar also compared to bacteriophage clamps. due to its central role in many dna related cellular functions the β-clamp is an active target for inhibitor drug design in the development of new antibiotics to combat drug resistant strains  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe the crystallographic structure of the dna polymerase iii β-clamp from the extremely radiation resistant bacterium deinococcus radiodurans . d. radiodurans exhibits an outstanding resistance to ionising radiation and desiccation and tolerates radiation doses up to  <dig>  gray  without loss of viability whereas most other organisms cannot survive doses above  <dig> gy  <cit> . such a massive radiation dose is estimated to induce several hundred double-strand breaks , thousands of single-strand gaps and about one thousand sites of dna base damage per chromosome . the overall structure of drβ-clamp is similar to e.coli β-clamp  and consists of a dimer which forms a ring lined by  <dig> α-helices, with an opening big enough to accommodate dsdna. each monomer consists of three domains  with identical topology. drβ-clamp displays a strong negative electrostatic surface potential on the outside of the ring, but a more even charge distribution inside the ring on the dna binding surface and in the dimer forming interface. we hypothesise that the evenly distributed surface charge inside the ring helps ensure efficient clamp loading and dna processivity which are needed to tackle the substantial amount of dna metabolic processes that are activated upon exposure to high doses of irradiation and desiccation.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
during the initial part of this work we discovered that the d. radiodurans gene sequence dr_ <dig> deposited in the genebank  was incorrectly annotated, encoding a protein of  <dig> instead of  <dig> amino acids. this was confirmed by sequence analysis and expression tests. the mistake was most likely caused by the automated gene recognition program used in the annotation of the sequenced genome. these programs can fail to recognise frame shifts caused by insertions or deletions . our discovery is in line with the findings of baudet et al.  <cit>  who showed that the original annotation of over a hundred d. radiodurans r <dig> genes is wrong and needs to be corrected. in  <dig> the d. radiodurans r <dig> genome was re-annotated by the ncbi ref seq project, and the new version of dr_ <dig> gene product , published june 12th 2014) corresponds to our short version of the protein . the reannotation confirms that we have been working with the biologically relevant version of the protein.

the short drβ-clamp protein sequence shares over 70% identity with other deinococcus β-clamp sequences, and  <dig> – 70% identity to sequences from other members of the phylum deinococcus-thermus. interestingly, the sequence identity to other gram-negative species is as low as to gram-positive species, below 32%.

overall structure
the crystal structure of drβ-clamp was determined in space group p <dig> to  <dig>  Å resolution using molecular replacement. despite our efforts, the dna oligomer the drβ-clamp was co-crystallised with was not clearly visible in the electron density, and could not be modelled into the structure. the asymmetric unit contains one drβ-clamp dimer , with  <dig> solvent atoms. a schematic representation of the structural model is presented in figure  <dig>  the majority  of the main-chain torsion angles were in the favoured regions of the ramachandran plot, with the remaining  <dig> % in the allowed regions. the final model had rwork and rfree values of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the details of the data collection and refinement statistics are given in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

like other bacterial β-clamps, the drβ-clamp forms a head to tail dimer of two monomers, each monomer composed of three domains with identical α/β topology . the domains are slightly shifted in position when comparing the two dimers, so that in addition to ncs restrains between chains a and b we also used tls refinement where each domain was defined as a separate group. the final rmsd between the chains is  <dig>  Å and between the domains on average  <dig>  Å. compared to the ecβ-clamp the overall rmsd is  <dig>  Å.

the shape of the drβ-clamp dimer is slightly more elliptic than that of the circular ecβ-clamp, with an internal diameter of  <dig> to  <dig> Å. a comparison of drβ-clamp core structure and surface contour  suggests that the elliptic shape of drβ-clamp cavity is enhanced by the conformation of certain long side chains and loops. the positively charged residues on the ring inner surface  appear flexible and side chains not involved in inter- or intramolecular interactions display poor electron density . in ecβ-clamp many of the basic side chains inside the clamp ring have been found to display flexibility and become ordered first upon contact with dna  <cit> .figure  <dig>

surface potential
a comparison of the electrostatic surface potential of β-clamps from d. radiodurans, e. coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis and thermotoga maritima  reveals some interesting differences. all molecules have a more or less uniform negative charge on the outside of the ring, with this effect being strongest in t. maritima and weakest in e. coli. on the inside of the ring all molecules have positively charged residues for interacting with dna. in e. coli, m. tuberculosis and t. maritima clamps the positive charge forms a relatively continuous band pattern across the surface whereas in drβ-clamp the charge is more spread forming small positive patches separated by negatively charged areas. the surface charge distribution of drβ-clamp may suggest that dna binding is less tight or less specific compared to the other clamps. an even distribution of both positive and negative charge may facilitate efficient clamp sliding on dna by hindering the formation of strong local interactions that might slow down the sliding movement.figure  <dig>

the drβ-clamp dimer interfaces have a spread, even charge distribution compared to the very strong positive  and negative charge  of the ecβ-clamp interfaces. the m. tuberculosis and t. maritima interfaces fall in between these two opposites, with t. maritima resembling more drβ-clamp. in t. maritima β-clamp and drβ-clamp electrostatic interactions may be less important in dimer formation and stability. analysis of dr- and ecβ-clamp interfaces with the protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies service  shows that the ecβ-clamp interface is larger and has more hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions  compared to drβ-clamp . the effect of dimer interface electrostatic interactions on clamp loading and dimer stability is currently not known.

the hydrophobicity pocket
a groove lined with hydrophobic residues called the hydrophobicity pocket or protein interaction pocket is located between domains b and c in ecβ-clamp. this pocket has been shown to serve as a ssdna interaction site during clamp loading  <cit>  in addition to being important for protein-protein interaction  <cit> . an analysis of the amino acid content  and structure  between domains b and c in drβ-clamp suggests that this hydrophobicity pocket is present also in drβ-clamp which thus may serve the same function as in ecβ-clamp.figure  <dig>

dna interacting residues
the positions of positively charged residues on the β-clamp inner surface appear to be only moderately conserved , indicating that dna backbone positioning is not critical. the dna complex structure of ecβ-clamp identified two residues inside the β-clamp ring, arg <dig> and gln <dig>  which are important for dsdna interaction and necessary for clamp loading  <cit> . in drβ-clamp these correspond to arg <dig> and glu <dig> . the consequence of having a negatively charged residue in drβ-clamp in the same position as glu <dig> in ecβ-clamp is not known, since no protein-dna interaction data is available at the moment. however, this residue is completely conserved among the sequenced deinococcus species, and is found also in m. tuberculosis and t. maritima β-clamps, and probably serves a similar function in these organisms as glu <dig> in ecβ-clamp.

structural explanation for lack of dna binding
an analysis of the ecβ-clamp-dna complex suggests that the dna in the structure is oriented in the opposite direction from what could be expected. this is caused by an interaction between the 5′ end of the dna  and the hydrophobicity pocket of a neighbouring clamp molecule. although this interaction is biologically relevant, it should normally occur on the same molecule which the dna is inside. the strong interaction with the hydrophobicity pocket is caused by stacking interactions of the third thymidine and the first adenine base of the oligomer with two tyrosines  in the pocket  <cit> . in drβ-clamp these tyrosines are substituted by ala <dig> and val <dig>  which may explain why the dna is bound in a too disorganised fashion to be clearly visible in the electron density. the electron density for dna is weak also in the eukaryotic complex structure  <cit> , which may indicate that the true dna binding mode is too unspecific and flexible to be well recorded by crystallographic methods. co-crystallization with different length and type oligonucleotides should be tested to screen for more specific binding enabling dna visualization.

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the crystal structure of drβ-clamp to  <dig>  Å resolution. the protein is a ring shaped dimer with a head-to-tail orientation and is similar to previously determined structures of bacterial β-clamps. based on the observation of an even charge distribution inside the ring we hypothesise that the protein is optimised for efficient function during high turnover of dna metabolic processes.
