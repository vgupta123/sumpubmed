BACKGROUND
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used for production of many different commercial compounds such as food, feed, beverages and pharmaceuticals  <cit> . it also serves as a model eukaryotic organism and has been the subject of more than  <dig>  research publications  <cit> . after the complete genome sequence for yeast was released in  <dig>  <cit> , about  <dig>  orfs were characterized  <cit>  and yeast contains many genes with human homologs  <cit> . this has allowed for comparative functional genomics and comparative systems biology between yeast and human. yeast, for example, has been used to understand the function of complex metabolic pathways that are related to the development of human diseases  <cit> .

several human diseases  are associated with disorders in lipid metabolism  <cit> . the emergence of lipidomics has allowed analysis of lipid metabolism at the systems level  <cit> . lipidomics promises to make a significant impact in our understanding of lipid related disease development  <cit> . as with other high-throughput techniques, however, we hypothesize that one of the main challenges for utilization of lipidome data will be our ability to develop appropriate frameworks to integrate and map data for studying relations between lipid metabolism and other cellular networks.

previous work has shown that genome-scale metabolic models provide an excellent scaffold for integrating data into single, coherent models  <cit> . the calculation of reporter metabolites using genome-scale metabolic models is an example of how metabolic models can be used to upgrade the information content of omics data  <cit> . this approach allows mapping of key metabolites and reactions in large metabolic networks when combined with transcriptome  <cit>  or metabolome data  <cit> . however, pathways, reactions, and genes that are not included in the metabolic network cannot be queried. therefore, the reporter metabolite algorithm requires a reliable and global genome scale-model to achieve precise and accurate data interpretation.

so far, three yeast genome-scale metabolic models, iff <dig>  ind <dig> and ill <dig>  have been published. all three models, however, lack a detailed description of the lipid metabolism. the first model, iff <dig>  <cit> , consists of  <dig> reactions linked to  <dig> orfs. iff <dig> shows good predictions of many different cellular functions  <cit>  and gene essentiality predictions  <cit> . however, almost all intermediate reactions in lipid metabolism were either lumped or neglected. the second model published was ind <dig>  <cit> . ind <dig> is fully compartmentalized, consisting of  <dig> reactions linked to  <dig> orfs. the model was validated by a large-scale gene deletion study and metabolic phenotypes  <cit>  and was expanded to include regulation for predicting gene expression and phenotypes of different transcription factor mutants  <cit> . ind <dig> contains more reactions and metabolites in lipid metabolism than iff <dig>  but still lacks a comprehensive description of lipid metabolism. the third published model is ill <dig>  which is derived from iff <dig> and comprises  <dig> reactions. several dead-end reactions of iff <dig> were eliminated leading to an improved accuracy of the single gene deletion prediction  <cit> . however, only minor improvements were made to reactions involved in lipid metabolism. the model was validated using 13c-labeling experiments to study the robustness of different yeast mutants  <cit> .

here our objective was to expand the genome-scale metabolic model of yeast to include a detailed description of lipid metabolism for use as a scaffold to integrate omics data. we used iff <dig> as a template for building a model based on recent literature that contains new reactions in lipid metabolism and transport relative to all previous models. the new model named iin <dig> includes  <dig> additional orfs and provides a more detailed structure of lipid metabolism, trna synthesis and transport processes than previous models. the biomass composition, which is very important for flux balance analysis and predicting lethality, was also recalculated and improved. iin <dig> was validated with large-scale gene deletion data and growth simulation predictions. simulated intracellular fluxes were also supported by 13c-labeling flux experimental data. finally, we show that the transcriptome data of yeast cultivated under various growth conditions can be integrated with iin <dig> to identify lipid related reporter metabolites. we anticipate that iin <dig> will be useful as a scaffold for integrating multilevel omic data and that this new model will have a significant impact in the emerging field of lipidomics.

RESULTS
model reconstruction and characteristics of iin800
due to the complexity of compartmentalization used in ind <dig> and the smaller scope of ill <dig>  the metabolic model iff <dig> was selected as a template for the development of the model iin <dig>  pathway and reaction databases , online resources , and literature were used to expand iff <dig>  with particular focus on lipid metabolism. iin <dig> contains  <dig> total reactions in lipid metabolism, more than at least  <dig> reactions greater than previous models .

to compare metabolic characteristics of the different in silico models, lipid metabolism was classified into unique sub-categories  . fatty acid synthesis and elongation accounted for three of these sub-categories. in contrast to previous models, iin <dig> incorporates fatty acid biosynthesis in both mitochondria and the cytosol. fatty acid synthesis, which involves iterative malonyl-coa condensations that result in a growing chain of fatty acids, is catalyzed by four major enzymes: β-ketoacyl-acp synthase , β-ketoacyl-acp reductase, β-dehydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase and enoyl-acp reductase. in the cytosol, these enzymes are encoded by the multifunctional fas <dig> and fas <dig>  in the mitochondria, however, fatty acid synthesis is carried out by the products encoded by cem <dig>  oar <dig>  htd <dig> and etr <dig>  these orfs were missing from previous models, which prevented simulation of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. fatty acid elongation, which leads to the production of long-chain fatty acids, was not included in iff <dig>  but was also updated in iin <dig>  including fatty acid elongation resulted in the addition of four major biochemical reaction steps: condensing enzyme, 3-ketoacyl-coa reductase, enoyl-coa dehydratase and enoyl-coa reductase  <cit> . these reactions are carried out by the enzymes encoded by elo <dig>  elo <dig>  elo <dig>  ifa <dig> and tsc <dig>  while the gene encoding enoyl-coa dehydratase has not been identified in s. cerevisiae, the reaction was inferred due to the identification of long chain fatty acids in yeast.

β-oxidation is the process where fatty acids, after becoming activated in the form of acyl-coas, are broken down to make acetyl-coa, and ultimately energy. fat <dig>  encoding an enzyme for long-chain fatty acid activation was missing in iff <dig> and ill <dig>  the genes sps <dig>  eci <dig> and dci <dig> are also now included in iin <dig>  as a result, iin <dig> can simulate the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids.

sphingolipid synthesis reactions were added to iin <dig> according to a recently reported model  <cit> , resulting in more sphingolipid reactions than the template iff <dig>  sphingolipid synthesis is the only sub-category in iin <dig> with a significantly lower reaction tally than ind <dig>  this is because ind <dig> incorporated both c24: <dig> and c26: <dig> as very long-chain fatty acids  to produce ceramides. because the amount of very long chain fatty acids in s. cerevisiae is so low relative to other fatty acid species   <cit> , iin <dig> treats very long chain fatty acids as a single metabolite. as a result, fewer reactions are present in sphingolipid synthesis.

relative to other models, only minor changes in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerides as well as ergosterol were introduced in iin <dig>  however, esterification of sterols and degradation of lipids, which were not included in all other previous models, are present in iin <dig> . finally,  <dig> orfs encoding for trna synthesis and one related enzyme, lipoamide dehydrogenase as well as  <dig> orfs encoding transporters were also included in iin <dig>  the additionally included orfs and their related references as well as detailed comparisons of reactions in lipid metabolism of all reported models are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

in summary, iin <dig> was reconstructed from  <dig> % of the characterized orfs in yeast and contains  <dig> metabolic reactions and  <dig> metabolites in total. this model is relatively more comprehensive as compared with previously described models . the network characteristics of iin <dig> and the starting model iff <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  within lipid metabolism, we have incorporated many new reactions in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid elongation, fatty acid activation and β-oxidation, sphingolipid synthesis, ergosterol esterification, and lipid degradation .  <dig> new reactions are derived from biochemical and physical considerations. these reactions mostly describe transportation of fatty acids and lipids across the mitochondria and the plasma membrane. to visualize the model iin <dig>  we constructed a comprehensive metabolic map using remapper software . this visualized map provides a method for globally plotting transcript and flux data onto iin <dig>  the source file is available for download .

improved biomass equation
the biomass equation is crucial for using genome-scale models to simulate growth using flux balance analysis . therefore, an important consideration in the development of iin <dig> was to address the concern that the biomass composition of s. cerevisiae changes under different growth conditions. for example, during growth on excess glucose the carbohydrate content increases and during growth on excess ammonium the protein content increases.

to assess the sensitivity of flux simulations using iin <dig> towards changes in the macro-molecular composition, we performed constraint-based simulations by varying the protein, rna, carbohydrate and lipid content of the biomass in physiological relevant ranges based on previous experimental reports  <cit> , from 35–65%,  <dig> –12%, 15–50% and 2–15%, respectively. specifically, glucose and ammonium uptake rates were minimized for both glucose- and ammonium-limited growth conditions, respectively, using different macromolecular compositions at fixed growth rates, . in this way, we could compare the differences between glucose- and ammonium-limited growth conditions. the results are illustrated in figure  <dig>  an interesting finding was that the protein content strongly affects the uptake rates at both glucose- and ammonium-limited conditions, albeit to a greater extent in ammonium-limited conditions . the carbohydrate content on the other hand does not have an impact on the ammonium uptake rate, it strongly impacts the glucose uptake rate . the rna content and the lipid content have only a minor impact on growth .

in summary, the sensitivity analysis shows that the biomass composition can significantly impact predictions made with genome-scale metabolic models to varying degrees based on different growth conditions. we therefore present new biomass equations to be used under c-limited and n-limited growth conditions, respectively. these compositions result from previous studies and our own measurements of lipids and fatty acids across multiple n-limited and c-limited growth conditions . using a separate biomass composition for n-limited cultures has not been proposed previously. the n-limited biomass equation is therefore new. relative to previous c-limited biomass compositions, the most dramatic changes in our here proposed biomass equation is with respect to the lipids and fatty acids . while our sensitivity analysis suggests that these components will most likely only lead to a small improvement in the accuracy of c-limited flux simulations, they may play an important role in lethality prediction by the model, as the addition of extra components in the biomass equation will give a higher resolution.

growth simulation capability
in silico genome-scale models are most generally used to predict various phenotypes. these include growth rates and extracellular secretion rates of metabolite products, as well as uptake rates of nutrients. in addition, models can be employed to explore active route in metabolic pathways under certain growth conditions as illustrated for a genome-scale metabolic model of e. coli  <cit>  as well as for one of the s. cerevisiae genome-scale metabolic models  <cit> .

to validate iin <dig>  we first investigated the model's ability to simulate aerobic and anaerobic growth in glucose- or ammonium-limited conditions. several published chemostat datasets were used as experimental references. as shown in figure  <dig>  the results from the computational growth prediction agreed with experimental measurements. less than 10% relative error was observed . the details of the simulations and the corresponding reference data are given in additional file  <dig>  intracellular fluxes can be easily visualized using the remapper software and our model .

since the new biomass equations would be expected to impact the overall flux distributions, we used 13c-flux analysis data to further confirm the computed intracellular fluxes. specifically, fluxes in the central carbon metabolism at two different growth conditions were both measured by 13c-labeling experiments and calculated by fba using iin <dig>  the model validation is shown in figure  <dig>  there is a high degree of agreement between the predicted and experimental fluxes in the central metabolism, with the exception of fluxes through the pentose phosphate pathway . using fba, the flux through the ppp is largely determined by the requirement for nadph, and it has earlier been shown difficult to balance nadph production and consumption  <cit> . this may explain why the fba simulations under-predict the flux through this pathway.

evaluation of large-scale gene deletion
to verify further iin <dig>  we investigated the ability of the model to predict for growth viability due to a single gene deletion. in silico deletion phenotype predictions were examined for the new model with cells grown in both minimal media with a sole carbon source  and with rich media . iin <dig> was assessed for its ability to make correct predictions based on experimental data  <cit> . a summary of the in silico single gene deletion predictions are given in table  <dig>  the overall prediction rate of iin <dig>  derived from  <dig> total predictions, was  <dig> %, with  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % selectivity. the evaluation of the mean of a confusion matrix as the geometric mean of iin <dig> equals  <dig> %. the performance of the iin <dig> model has improved by ~2% and ~7% in terms of overall prediction rate compared with the models iff <dig> and ind <dig>  respectively. we believe that the improvement is mainly due to upgrades in the biomass equation, which is consistent with results from kuepfer et al. demonstrating that more accurate biomass compositions lead to improved lethality predictions  <cit> . the false predictions might be due to missing information in gene regulation, biomass compositions, dead-end reactions and medium composition, especially in the rich medium  <cit>

integration of transcriptome data with genome-scale metabolic models
genome-scale metabolic models have shown promise for identifying reporter metabolites, defined as metabolites whose neighboring genes in a bipartite metabolic graph are most significantly affected and respond as a group to genetic or environmental perturbations  <cit> . such an approach has previously been used to reveal important regulatory hot-spots in metabolism from genome-wide expression data and has demonstrated promise for integrating omic data using network topology. to highlight the importance and utility of having a more complete metabolic model in this integrated analysis, the genome-scale models iin <dig> and iff <dig> were used to calculate reporter metabolites. multiple sets of transcriptome data were used for analysis. lists of the top thirty most significant reporter metabolites for several perturbations are compared between iin <dig> and iff <dig> in table  <dig>  and reporter metabolites unique to iin <dig> are marked in bold.

first, transcriptome data from the yeast metabolic cycle  <cit>  were analyzed. notably, the reporter algorithm identified unique reporter metabolites with iin <dig> that would have been missed if iff <dig> was used as the scaffold . the most dramatic difference was observed for the reductive charging phase of the metabolic cell cycle. while both models revealed the importance of regulation controlling the cellular response at glycogen, trehalose, udp-glucose, glucose-6-p and glucose nodes, only iin <dig> was able to identify key intermediates in β-oxidation. for example, iin <dig> identified trans-3-acyl-coas, trans-2-acyl-coas, 3-keto-acyl-coas and some fatty acids as reporter metabolites . this result demonstrates the advantage of expanding the metabolic model to include a much more detailed description of lipid metabolism. namely, we can now use the genome-scale metabolic model to identify the regulatory importance of lipid precursors and intermediates at different physiological conditions or at different phases of cellular growth. searching for highly co-regulated subnetworks that implicate lipid genes is also now possible.

further demonstrations of the applicability of iin <dig> as a scaffold to integrate omic data were performed by analyzing transcriptome data derived from nutrient-limited  <cit> , oxygen-limited  <cit>  and temperature stress conditions  <cit>  previously, mrna and protein levels of genes and enzymes in fatty acid catabolism have been shown to be significantly different between carbon-limited and nitrogen limited growth  <cit> . when comparing these conditions, only iin <dig> was able to identify fatty acids as reporter metabolites . in anaerobic yeast cultivation, oleic acid has to be added to the medium because unsaturated fatty acids synthesis is not possible; therefore, the expression of genes in this pathway is induced by the function of the ore element  <cit> . consistent with this observed cellular response, only iin <dig>  with identified reporter metabolites involved in β-oxidation . similarly, iin <dig> was able to highlight the importance of unsaturated fatty acids when comparing high and low temperature cultivations , which is known to be important for maintaining proper membrane structure and fluidity  <cit> .

without the expanded model, the importance of cellular regulation stemming from lipid metabolism would be missed in analyses where metabolic topology is used for integrating data. as an illustration, we integrated results from our reporter metabolite analysis with known protein-protein and protein-dna interaction networks to infer regulatory structure. first, genes associated to reporter metabolites in lipid metabolism unique to iin <dig> and determined when comparing carbon- and nitrogen-limited growth  were identified. these genes were then used to search for highly regulated subnetworks within a protein-protein and protein-dna interaction network. by applying a p-value threshold of  <dig>  to filter for genes with significant gene expression, we inferred a regulatory network controlling the expression of lipid metabolism genes associated to the reporter metabolites . strikingly, regulators at the top of this hierarchy are consistent with those previously known to be significantly changed between carbon- and nitrogen-limited growth. these include: snf <dig>  snf <dig>  mig <dig> and adr <dig> , oaf <dig> , and ino <dig> and ino <dig> , among others. previously reported genome-scale models are not capable of being used as scaffolds for implicating the conditional response of these lipid metabolism regulators because they lack a detailed description of lipid metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-scale metabolic models have emerged as a valuable tool in the post-genomic era for illustrating whole-cell functions based on the complete network of biochemical reactions. an iterative reconstruction process is required to achieve a comprehensive s. cerevisiae genome-scale metabolic model. in this work, we focused on improving the formulation of lipid metabolism relative to previously published s. cerevisiae genome-scale metabolic models. validating the model and new biomass equations, the constraint-based simulation of iin <dig> showed accurate predictions of cellular growth and is also consistent with 13c-labeling experiments. furthermore, in silico gene essentialness predictions were found to be in high agreement with in vivo results. finally, we show that iin <dig>  being more complete, is a better network scaffold for integration of multilevel omics data.

in conclusion, by incorporating a more complete description of lipid metabolism, iin <dig> is positioned to have a broader impact than previously described yeast models. its capability of predictions were consistent with a number of experimental data both quantitatively  and qualitatively . moreover, the new model is positioned to be used for studying the regulation and role of lipid metabolism during different growth conditions. with the high degree of homology in lipid metabolism between yeast and humans and emergence of lipidomics, this is expected to allow for new insights into the connection between lipid metabolism and overall cellular function for industrial and medical applications.
