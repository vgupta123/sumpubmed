BACKGROUND
placentae exhibit remarkable variation in tissue structure and morphology within and between mammalian clades, and even within a single mammalian order  <cit> . the diversity of placental architectures is thought to be the result of adaptive evolution arising from rapidly diverging and novel genes  <cit> . a greater understanding of the functional roles that these genes play would provide insights into the molecular basis for the unique phenotypic and metabolic adaptations among closely related mammalian species. toward that end, we previously identified and bioinformatically characterized novel transcripts in cattle using placenta as a source tissue  <cit> . these transcripts are lineage-specific , and the genes that encode them have no detectable homology to genes outside of that lineage . functional elucidation of lsgs remains a daunting task and only a few have been characterized beyond their expression patterns  <cit> . a complementary approach that would direct the genetic and biochemical characterization of lsgs and their products is functional inference using co-expression  <cit>  and promoter analysis  <cit> .

gene expression is regulated by a complex interaction of transcription factors  and their binding sites  on the gene promoter. co-expression analysis is based upon the assumption that a high degree of similarity in gene expression profiles correlates with relatedness of their functions  <cit> . genes that are highly co-expressed are often regulated by common transcription factor, forming sub-networks of genes with a common function  <cit> . as a general rule, co-regulated genes share a specific arrangement of tfbss on their promoters. the tfbss are often located in a specific order relative to the transcription start site  as well as in a particular orientation with respect to the promoter  <cit> . for example, kindy et al.  <cit>  showed that both strands of the c-myc gene are transcribed in an overlapping fashion and that transcription of the coding and non-coding strands is regulated independently. yu and coauthors  <cit>  showed a strong correlation between inter-tfbs distances and their orientation with respect to each other, demonstrating that a combination of tfs rather than an individual tf is the functional unit in tissue-specific gene regulation. others have shown that the inter-tfbs distance between functionally over-represented tfbs pairs can vary significantly from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, although it may be greater than  <dig> bp in some cases  <cit> . these findings provide insights into factors governing the interactions between specific tfs and document tf pairs that are predicted to act synergistically in a tissue-specific manner  <cit>  or at specific stages of development  <cit> .

in a previous work we identified  <dig> cattle- and cetartiodactyl-specific novel transcripts that included coding sequences and noncoding rnas   <cit> . in the present work, we have inferred functions of a subset of these lsts using co-expression analysis. in addition, we identified over-represented tfbss and their composites in the promoters of co-expressed genes and searched existing databases and the literature for pathways and functions in which these tfs may play a synergistic role in a specific tissue or developmental stage. using these functional inferences, we predicted sub-networks of genes that may be co-regulated with the lsgs. our results predict that subsets of these lsgs function in glycerophospholipid/fatty acid metabolism and protein trafficking in liver and near-term placenta, and in processes involving the initiation of parturition and immune system development.

RESULTS
identification of tissue-specific and time-series clusters
a strategy for inferring functions of lsts  was applied to  <dig> previously identified lsts  <cit>  . two microarray expression datasets, consisting of profiles of ~ <dig>  cattle genes  <cit>  and including these lsts, were used for generating co-expression clusters. from the dataset consisting of profiles of total rna from  <dig> cattle tissues,  <dig> lsts and  <dig>  known genes were selected for further analysis after applying filtering conditions . using the lsts as seeds, two clusters were identified that showed preferential expression in a specific tissue with at least two-fold higher expression compared to any other tissue .

from the liver time-series dataset  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> lsts that had tissue profiles and  <dig>  known expressed genes were selected for clustering after data filtering . two large clusters were identified with average pairwise pearson correlation r ≥  <dig> , and r ≥  <dig>  between any lst and transcripts encoded by known genes. the identity of the genes in these clusters overlapped, and instead of merging the clusters by lowering the correlation threshold, we selected the largest cluster containing four lsts and  <dig> known transcripts  for further analysis. these transcripts were co-expressed at seven time-points and two diets . apart from liver, the genes in this cluster were expressed at higher levels in adrenal gland, cerebrum, and placentome .

in order to identify plane of nutrition  and time-dependent relationships from the liver time-series data  <cit> , the  <dig> lsts that passed filtering of the liver expression data were hierarchically clustered . the four lsts in the livr cluster  were down-regulated at - <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig> days relative to parturition in animals fed a restricted-energy diet pre-partum . analysis of the entire livr cluster for diet and time-dependent relationships indicated that the genes were under-expressed by  <dig> -fold at + <dig> and + <dig> days after parturition in liver of animals on a lower  as compared to higher  plane of nutrition pre-partum . this suggests that the expression of the livr cluster during the peri-partum period is directly influenced by plane of nutrition pre-partum .

livr cluster and functional inference for lsgs
the livr cluster contains  <dig> known genes and four lsgs, 237ng, 266ng, 39ng, and 5bp . to determine the subsets of genes in the livr cluster that may be co-regulated, we predicted and analyzed tfbss and their composites in upstream promoter regions  relative to the tss using cattle genome   <cit>  sequence. p <dig> and oct- <dig> tfbss were found to be significantly over-represented in the livr cluster. the oct- <dig> site had a high frequency in the cluster and was predicted in  <dig> genes including the lsg 39ng. of the over-represented paired composite tfbss, srebp-1*pax- <dig> was predicted in the upstream region of two lsgs, 237ng and 266ng, and known genes ccdc <dig> , mx <dig> , ngly <dig> , plce <dig> , trip <dig> , and zdhhc <dig> . a search of the composite regulatory signature discovery  database  <cit>  for tfs srebp- <dig> together with pax- <dig> identified glycerophospholipid metabolism, among others, as over-represented pathways . the cluster was enriched for another paired composite, sp1*pax- <dig>  which was predicted in the lsg 237ng and five other known genes. this suggests that 237ng is regulated by all three tfs, sp <dig>  srebp- <dig> and pax- <dig>

an unordered triplet composite of tfbss  that was over-represented in the cluster, was predicted in lsg 237ng and five other known genes . the three tfs that bind to those sites were found to be active in the adipocytokine signaling pathway on the basis of a crsd search  <cit> . comparison of the motifs predicted ab initio using ann-spec  <cit>  with known tfbss identified elf1- and sp1-like sites as matches, indicating that elf <dig> and sp <dig> tfs regulate genes in the livr cluster . as corroborating evidence, an elf <dig> binding site was predicted in 13% of the genes in the livr cluster, including 266ng and 5bp, and an sp <dig> site was predicted in 27% of the genes, which included the lsg 237ng. analysis of the livr cluster using ingenuity pathway analysis   <cit>  showed it to be enriched for genes in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, dna repair, cell death, organ development of epidermis and immune response .

plac cluster and functional inference for lsgs
the plac cluster was expressed preferentially in placentome and consisted of  <dig> genes, including three that are lsgs, 34fl, 22je, and 104je . on the basis of psi-blast search  <cit>  and multiple sequence alignments we have annotated one of the lsts, 34fl , as an sslp- <dig>  homolog, which belongs to a class of secreted ly <dig> domain containing proteins. the predicted protein product of 34fl, like the sslp- <dig> glycoprotein in mouse  <cit> , has  <dig> cysteines and contained the conserved c-terminal ccxxxxxcn motif, indicating that it is a member of the sslp- <dig> secreted ly- <dig> glycoprotein subfamily . in addition, 34fl was predicted by psortii  <cit>  to contain a signal peptide, and was localized to the extracellular region providing evidence that it is a secreted protein. furthermore, the 34fl gene was located on bta <dig> in an orthologous region that is syntenic with mouse sslp- <dig> on mmu <dig> 

the plac cluster was not found to be enriched for any single tfbs or tfbs triplets. however, we identified four tfbs composite pairs in the cluster . the pair, stat*pax- <dig> , was predicted in the lsg 34fl, pag <dig> , and ptgs <dig> . the motifs predicted ab initio by ann-spec in the cluster had significant matches to nf-κb , maz , and sp <dig> tfbss. all three sites were predicted in the cluster at varying frequency, although none were predicted in an lsg . the cluster was found to be enriched for wnt/β-catenin signaling and acute phase response  signaling pathways. other enriched ipa functions in the plac cluster were transport of amino acids and synthesis of prostaglandins, adhesion, development of trophoblast cells, and lipid metabolism.

thym cluster and functional inference for lsgs
a thymus-specific cluster  was identified, consisting of  <dig> genes, including two lsgs 383ng and 21pw. both of these are single-exon transcripts  and have multiple ests from different libraries as evidence of transcription. 383ng is a paralog that has been duplicated in two other locations on the same chromosome  <cit> . the thym cluster was found to be enriched for v-myb  and krox  tfbss . three tfbs composite pairs were over-represented in the thym cluster, of which one, nkx2-5*cdxa, was predicted in the lsg 21pw and asxl <dig> . an ab initio predicted motif matched the irf  tfbs. irf- <dig> was identified in 21% of the genes in the cluster, including the lsgs 383ng and 21pw . an analysis of the thym cluster using ipa showed enrichment for genes involved in apoptosis, immune and lymphatic system development, transcription and trans-activation, and cell proliferation .

gene interaction network for the livr cluster
we then used weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  to identify sub-networks in the livr cluster. only one module consisting of all the  <dig> genes was identified indicating the integrity of the cluster. on the basis of gene connectivity measurements, the top five hub genes  with the highest connectivity were identified in the livr cluster, and included the lsg 237ng. the hub genes cngb <dig>  and gga <dig>  are known to play roles in ion and intracellular protein transport. the hub genes il22ra <dig>  functions in cell signaling and fabp <dig>  in fa metabolism and signaling, suggesting that in addition to protein transport, these are dominant processes represented in the livr cluster. using gene interactions from genego metacore  <cit> , which is modeled on known pathways in humans, a network was inferred for a subset of genes that are co-expressed with 237ng and 266ng. in addition, hub genes were added to build the network .

discussion
functional elucidation of a novel gene is a challenging task. we have used an informatics-based strategy  to infer functions of a set of lsgs first found expressed in a cattle term-placenta cdna library  <cit> . this was accomplished by generating co-expression clusters  using lsts as seeds to cluster other genes from two microarray datasets consisting of transcript profiles from  <dig> cattle-tissues and liver of animals fed two different diets at several peripartal time-points. we then identified over-represented tfbss and their composites in the promoters of co-expressed genes, and searched existing databases and the literature, for pathways and functions in which these tfs may play a role in a specific tissue or developmental stage. yu and co-authors found that genes targeted by the same tf tend to be co-expressed, with the degree of co-expression increasing if genes share more than one tf  <cit> . this provides significant validation of our approach, and gives us confidence in the sub-networks of co-regulated genes that were identified. we present below a synthesis of our results with the aim of supporting the inferred functions of lsgs in each cluster.

evidence supporting inferred functions for lsgs in the livr cluster
the livr cluster was found to be enriched for genes in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, dna repair, transport, cell death, organ development of epidermis, and immune response functions . these pathways and functions are also characteristic of term placenta  <cit> , which was the source tissue used to create the cdna library from which the lsts were identified. in support of the correlated pathways and functions of genes in liver and placenta we also found that the livr cluster genes are expressed in placentome . glycerophospholipid metabolism plays a significant role in the onset of labor in humans  <cit> , and apoptosis and immunological processes are known to represent important cellular functions in term-placenta  <cit> . the overlapping functions likely represent common subpopulations of cells in liver and placenta, such as macrophages and lymphocytes.

genes in the livr cluster were enriched for p <dig> and oct- <dig> tfbss. p <dig> exerts a variety of regulatory effects following dna damage  <cit> . an oct- <dig> tfbs has been predicted in the 39ng promoter along with a pparγ site. pparγ works in concert with oct- <dig> to mediate transcriptional activation of gadd <dig>   <cit> . the presence of both oct- <dig> and pparγ sites on the 39ng promoter suggests a role for the encoded protein in dna repair processes in response to dna damage. in addition, the protein is predicted by psortii  <cit>  to be a nuclear protein, which supports such a role. a paired tfbs composite, srebp-1*pax- <dig>  was significantly over-represented in the livr cluster, and was predicted in two lsgs, 237ng and 266ng. it was also predicted in plce <dig>  ngly <dig>  and trip <dig>  which have known roles in fatty acid  metabolism, turnover of glycoproteins, and lipid binding, respectively . srebp- <dig> is known to regulate genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, triglycerides and phospholipids in liver and adipocytes  <cit> , and has been shown to play a role in glycerophospholipid metabolism  <cit>  suggesting that 237ng and 266ng are also involved in these processes. smith and coauthors reviewed evidence that show pax- <dig> works together with srebp- <dig> to target pparγ  in adipocytes and liver  <cit> . some of these livr genes were shown to form sub-networks that participate in glycerophospholipid metabolism, protein transport and signaling pathways in liver . the lsg, 237ng, is inferred to play a role in glycerophospholipid metabolism and cytokine signaling, and is one of the hub genes.

the livr cluster was enriched for an unordered triplet tfbs composite, ap- <dig>  zf <dig>  c-ets <dig> , which included the lsg 237ng, ankrd <dig>  arf <dig>  tmem14c, arl4a, and nsmce4a. the transcription factor ap- <dig>  is correlated with expression of cytokine-induced serum amyloid a <dig> gene  in cattle liver  <cit>  and is known to be a repressor for saa <dig>  <cit> . saa <dig> plays a role in the immune system, supporting a role for 237ng in cytokine-related immune processes. ap- <dig> and zf <dig> binding sites have been predicted together in liver by smith et al  <cit> . a sub-network of genes including arf <dig>  arfgap <dig> and the hub gene gga <dig>  which play roles in protein trafficking and localization within the golgi apparatus, was shown previously to be linked with processes in signaling and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways in liver . a motif predicted ab initio by ann-spec shows a significant similarity to the tfbs for elf <dig>  which is predicted in 13% of the livr gene promoters, including the promoter regions of 266ng and 5bp . the elf <dig> tf plays a role in early liver development of mouse embryos  <cit> , thus suggesting a similar role for these two lsgs .

expression of the livr genes was found to be affected by pre-partum diet. they were down-regulated by restricted feeding at + <dig> and + <dig> days postpartum suggesting that the predicted functions  are down-regulated during the early post-partum period when the animals are fed restricted diets that do not meet 100% of the estimated energy requirements during the non-lactating period. this management strategy is more successful in preparing the animal to the onset of parturition and lactation, and leads to lower incidence of metabolic disease  <cit> . therefore, animals on a higher plane of nutrition  show increased inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and dna repair; a conclusion shared by loor and coauthors  <cit> . above, we suggested that glycerophospholipid metabolism is a common function in liver and near-term placenta in animals approaching labor and delivery. metabolic processes in both tissues have been shown to be affected by diet in non-ruminants. for example, in pregnant mice the fa composition in the mother's diet influences the maternal liver and fetal placenta fa composition  <cit> . these findings suggest that the livr genes, many of which are involved in fa-linked functions, protein transport and cell signaling, play similar diet-responsive roles in both liver and placenta of pregnant animals , given that nearly all  of the livr genes, including the lsgs, are also expressed in the placenta .

evidence supporting inferred functions of lsgs in the plac cluster
the plac cluster genes were found to be preferentially up-regulated in placentome and enriched for specific processes in the placenta; e.g. transport of amino acids and synthesis of prostaglandins, trophoblast cell adhesion, lipid metabolism, transcription, and cell proliferation . the cluster is also enriched for acute phase response  genes, which function to restore homeostasis. these apr gene products are a variety of serum proteins synthesized in increased amounts in response to trauma and infection. given that labor and delivery result in oxidative and immunological stresses, with apr and apoptotic responses in placental tissue  <cit> , apr enrichment provides a snap-shot of these processes in near-term placenta. the cluster is also enriched for wnt/β-catenin signaling, which has been shown to play a central role in coordinating uterus-embryo interactions required for implantation in mouse  <cit> .

the composite tfbs pair, stat*pax- <dig>  was over-represented in three co-expressed genes; 34fl, pag <dig>  and ptgs <dig>  the pwm for the predicted stat binding site is common to a range of stat proteins that are involved in the development and function of the immune system and play a role in maintaining immune tolerance and tumor surveillance. ptgs <dig> is a biosynthetic isoenzyme that was shown in pregnant cows and guinea-pigs to be involved in intrauterine prostaglandin  synthesis, which is crucial for the initiation of parturition  <cit> . ptgs <dig> was found to be 20-fold greater in cattle term placentomes  compared with preterm placentomes  further supporting its role in parturition  <cit> . given that our data show that 34fl , pag <dig>  and ptgs <dig> are highly co-expressed and predicted to be regulated by stat tfs, we suggest that 34fl also plays a role in pregnancy and/or parturition.

the ann-spec motifs predicted ab initio in the plac cluster have significant matches to tfbss for nf-κb , maz , and sp <dig> . nf-κb is known to initiate transcription for a variety of genes that are involved in immune response, acute phase and inflammatory processes  <cit> . it has been located in human fetal membranes and decidua at term and pre-term delivery  <cit> . the physiological expression of cox- <dig>  in rat trophoblast involves a sustained activation of nf-κb, and its inhibition abrogates the inducibility of ptgs <dig>  <cit> . this result functionally links nf-κb and ptgs <dig> with the other co-expressed genes in the plac cluster, suggesting a complex role for glycoproteins including 34fl in initiating and orchestrating the cell biology at the feto-maternal interface before parturition .

evidence supporting functional inference for lsgs in the thym cluster
the thymus is an immune system organ that is of central importance to the maturation of t lymphocytes. genes in the thym cluster are enriched for the related functions immune system and lymphatic system development, cell death, and cellular growth and proliferation . the v-myb tfbs was over-represented in the thym cluster and predicted in lsg 383ng. the v-myb oncogene product causes late onset t cell lymphomas when expressed in the t cell lineage of transgenic mice  <cit> , thus suggesting a role for this lsg 383ng in cell-proliferation. the tfbs composite pair nkx2-5*cdxa was over-represented in promoters of 21pw and asxl <dig> . cdxa and nkx <dig> have been shown to be markers for endoderm germ layer patterning during gastrulation, a process necessary for formation of the thymus  <cit> . the asxl <dig> gene in drosophila is required to maintain homeotic gene activation and silencing, and its homologs have been identified in mouse and found to be expressed in thymus  <cit> . the roles played by the tfs cdxa and nkx <dig> in endoderm germ layer patterning, and that of asxl <dig> in homeotic gene activation and silencing support a role for the lsg 21pw in thymus development. furthermore, the irf- <dig> tfbs, which regulates il- <dig> gene expression and influences the development of t-cells and natural killer cells in the thymus  <cit> , is predicted in lsgs 383ng and 21pw . taken together, these findings implicate 383ng and 21pw in immune system development and cell-proliferation .

CONCLUSIONS
we selected the placenta as a model system to identify and functionally characterize novel lsgs because of its unique characteristics as a rapidly evolving physiological system in mammals. as we and others have shown, the placenta is a rich source of expressed lsgs and rapidly diverging genes  <cit> . such genes are candidates for adaptive placental functions acquired by the ruminant lineage. we used a combination of cluster analysis, promoter analysis, wcgna, and gene annotation to predict the functions of nine previously uncharacterized lsgs  from a starting set of  <dig> . the stringent analysis criteria produced unique and highly correlated gene expression clusters among  <dig> different tissues and across seven time-points and two diets in liver . the three clusters analyzed contained nine lsts, seven of which are encoded by presumptive novel protein encoding lsgs and two are presumptive ncrnas  <cit> . our results represent a major advance in characterizing the novel lsts expressed in bovine placenta and have yielded predictions of functions that are consistent with their putative role in ruminant reproductive and immune physiology.

as additional animal genomes are sequenced and the numbers of novel genes with unknown functions increases, our approach establishes a valuable precedent for future studies. we show that it is possible to identify and characterize a significant fraction of lineage-specific genes bioinformatically, which may guide hypothesis-driven experiments to determine their biochemical and cellular functions. these may in turn yield new insights into the role of lsgs in speciation and adaptive evolution.
