BACKGROUND
in flowering plants, small rnas below  <dig> nucleotides in size are essential and diverse components of the transcriptome  <cit> . since their initial discovery in plants, small rna systems have become better characterised and various classes of small rna molecules with different functions are now recognisable. these functions include regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, repression of transposable element activity and defence against viral pathogens, and directed epigenetic changes in the genome such as dna methylation and heterochromatin formation  <cit> .

micrornas are a distinct class of small rnas derived from endogenous pol ii-transcribed genes. the transcripts from these genes form fold-back structures or hairpins that are recognised in the nucleus by the protein machinery of the microrna pathway  <cit> . these hairpin transcripts are processed in specific bodies in the nucleus by proteins such as dicer-like <dig>   <cit> . here, a site-specific excision process removes a ~ <dig> nucleotide duplex rna from the stem of the hairpin structure. this rna is then exported to the cytoplasm, where one strand binds the argonaute <dig>  protein in the risc complex. subsequently, this protein-rna complex interacts with mrnas with high complementarity to the mirna. in flowering plants, the slicer endonuclease activity of the ago <dig> protein acts to cleave the mrna where it binds the mirna  <cit> . subsequently, the cleaved mrna is routed into degradation pathways. in this manner, not only is the translation of the mrna prevented but the levels of the mrna target are down-regulated. in plants, it has now been shown that micrornas also act to repress translation without cleavage of the mrna, a regulatory mechanism that appears to involve not only ago <dig> but also ago <dig> and probably another member of the argonaute family  <cit> . over  <dig> micrornas have now been described in arabidopsis thaliana and these are known to directly regulate a large number of transcripts, in particular those that encode key regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and f-box proteins that regulate entry of other proteins into the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.

certain mirnas do not target coding mrnas but instead recognise long non-coding transcripts from so-called tas loci  <cit> . these mirnas are homologous to one or more typically two different sites on the target tas transcript. these sites act as recognition points from which further small rnas are formed  <cit> . after cleavage to generate two tas fragments, the tas rna is further processed to generate secondary small rnas  <cit> . an rna-dependent rna polymerase enzyme, rdr <dig>  is then recruited to synthesise a complementary strand and the resulting duplex rna is sequentially cut by the dicer-like  <dig> dcl <dig> enzyme to form phased  <dig> nt small rnas called trans-acting sirnas  <cit> . the exact mechanism by which a single conventional cleavage event directed by a microrna recruits rdr <dig> and dcl <dig> activity to generate secondary sirnas from tas rnas remains poorly understood  <cit> . secondary sirnas are known to be only rarely produced after conventional mirna cleavage events on coding transcripts  <cit> .

in plants, further classes of small rnas are produced from rnas derived from non-coding regions of the genome by various mechanisms, from both polii and polii-independent sources  <cit> . these small rnas have a major role in establishing and maintaining patterns of dna methylation and heterochromatin architecture throughout the genome  <cit> .

recent innovations in sequencing technology  <cit>  have allowed extensive surveys of small rna populations in flowering plants, notably in the model species arabidopsis thaliana. however, until recently much of this work was focused on collectively sequencing the small rnas from complex aggregates of sporophytic tissues to whole plants from both wild type and mutant lines. notably absent has been a focus on the reproductive cells and the highly reduced post-meiotic male and female gametophytes . in flowering plants, gametes are not directly formed from the meiotic products but instead arise from a limited number of haploid mitotic divisions. in the male gametophyte, the four products of meiosis each undergo two further mitotic divisions. the first division is highly asymmetric and forms a larger vegetative cell and a smaller generative or germ cell. the germ cell undergoes a further division to form a pair of sperm cells that are suspended within the vegetative cell cytoplasm. in arabidopsis, mature pollen grains at the point of release from the anthers consist of three cells of these two distinct cell types.

previous work has questioned whether small rna pathways are maintained and function as the male gametophyte develops  <cit> . however, it is clear from recent investigations that small rna pathways are not down regulated, but transcript levels of various small rna pathway genes show dynamic and complex changes during male gametophyte development  <cit> . it is evident that cell-specific differences contribute to these dynamic changes as sperm cells are significantly enriched for some transcripts, such as ago <dig>  compared to whole mature pollen  <cit> . recent work has shown that silencing of repetitive dna and transposons is weakened in the vegetative cell leading to the formation of  <dig> nt small rnas from their transcripts that are claimed to reinforce silencing in the associated sperm cells  <cit> . a functioning microrna pathway in mature pollen has been confirmed despite suggestions that mature micrornas may not be produced from their precursors in late pollen development  <cit> . not only have several families of micrornas with a known function in the somatic phase of development been identified in pollen by in situ hybridisation  <cit> , but many more have been discovered by rt-pcr analysis and the use of a modified 5' race protocol that has demonstrated the precise cleavage of transcripts targeted by several different micrornas  <cit> . thus, micrornas and other small rnas are likely to make a major but hitherto unappreciated contribution to pollen gene expression patterns.

we have utilised  <dig> sequencing to explore the diversity of small rnas in mature pollen of a. thaliana. we describe the general composition of the small rna population present in mature pollen and focus on the diversity of micrornas and tasirnas, as these small rnas have a direct effect on the abundance and translation of target mrnas. we identify known micrornas and tasirnas and also survey the sequence information for putative novel micrornas. we independently verify the expression in pollen and relative abundance of selected microrna sequences identified by  <dig> sequencing using quantitative rt-pcr. amongst the candidate novel micrornas, we confirm that one, named ath-mir <dig>  cleaves its predicted target transcript, at3g <dig>  this corresponds to a pollen-specific f-box family transcript that is significantly enriched in sperm cells. its discovery supports the assertion that novel mirnas exist with putative roles in regulating gametophyte-specific transcripts that may be of key importance in reproduction.

RESULTS
the pollen  <dig> sequencing dataset
among the  <dig> unique sequences between  <dig> and  <dig> nt, the majority are between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length - the usual range size of small rnas in plants. in terms of sequencing depth, more than  <dig> % of these sequences are represented by only  <dig> read,  <dig> % by  <dig> to  <dig> reads while the remaining 1% are represented by more than  <dig> reads. this indicates that our data are mainly qualitative and demand further verification and quantification, at least for specific micrornas. blast analysis on arabidopsis chromosomes indicates that 41% of the  <dig> unique sequences perfectly or nearly perfectly  match the genome, which corresponds to 55% of the total reads . however, around 60% of the unique sequences show  <dig> mismatches or more indicating that the rate of sequencing mistakes is probably relatively high. the short lengths of the sequences thus make the analysis difficult because mismatching at this level can generate several ambiguous potential hits. to avoid mis-identification of some small rnas we decided to use only the  <dig> sequences showing  <dig> or only  <dig> mismatch to the genome for further blast analysis.

sequences between  <dig> and  <dig> nt were used for blastn analysis of the arabidopsis genome sequence. the numbers of unique sequences scoring a blast hit  are indicated, together with read numbers.

global blast analysis
blast analysis of the  <dig> sequences was performed in both genic and intergenic nucleotide databases .  <dig> sequences recorded hits in the two distinct databases with exactly the same score and it was thus impossible to assign them to either a genic or an intergenic location.  <dig> % of the sequences were located to intergenic sequences, which makes them candidates for sirnas associated with silencing of these regions through dna methylation and chromatin modification. among  <dig> % of sequences matching the genic part of the genome, around 1% are associated with post-transcriptional silencing rnas , the focus of this paper. close to  <dig> %  of identified small rnas correspond to protein-coding genes suggesting the regulation of the corresponding transcripts by silencing rna pathways . other sequences exactly match transposable element  genes, which agrees with reports of abundant sirnas silencing tes in arabidopsis mature pollen  <cit> . a significant proportion  of the small rna sequences share homology with genic parts of the genome corresponding to ubiquitous and highly expressed structural rnas such as rrna or trna. this is a common occurrence in small rna sequencing analyses, presumably arising from their abundance as normal cellular degradation products. a very small proportion of small rnas  correspond to mitochondrial small rnas and less than  <dig> % correspond to chloroplastic small rnas.

sequences with  <dig> or  <dig> mismatch with the arabidopsis genome were compared with the intergenic and "genic" databases. some matched silencing rnas , candidate silencing rnas , non-protein coding rnas  and organellar small rnas. other sequences either matched intergenic regions, or could not be assigned to either region. nb: number of unique sequences

identification and quantitative rt-pcr validation of known micrornas
blastn analysis of the  <dig> unique sequences with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mismatches led to the identification of  <dig> known arabidopsis micrornas corresponding to  <dig> reads . some mir* instead of, or in addition to the mir were also identified for the mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families. the major proportion of the identified micrornas target transcription factors, with  <dig> reads  for mir156/ <dig> ,  <dig> reads  for mir <dig>  and  <dig> reads  for mir <dig> . another important category of identified micrornas targets the ppr protein family with  <dig> reads  for mir <dig> and  <dig>  for mir <dig> 

a separate blastn analysis of all sequences against the arabidopsis micrornas database has been performed to add to the list of identified mirnas first generated by the global blastn analysis. shorter sequences as well as sequences showing  <dig> mismatches have been included. this resulted in the detection of  <dig> different mirnas or mirnas* in col- <dig> mature pollen.

interestingly, several components of the different epigenetic pathways seem to be targeted by micrornas in pollen. mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were detected, targeting argonaute <dig> and argonaute <dig> respectively. one single read of mir <dig> which targets dcl <dig> has also been detected. mir <dig> and mir <dig> that target methyltransferases  are also present. the remaining micrornas target genes involved in hormone response like auxin-response factors , genes involved in general metabolism or those having no identified targets.

mir <dig> and mir <dig>  that target tas genes are also detectable which suggests activity of the tasirna pathway, where initial cleavage of the tas transcripts by these mirnas is required to initiate tasirna biogenesis. nine of the  <dig> detected micrornas were singletons, which leaves open the possibility that their expression levels are either similar, or that the number of sequencing reads in this study was insufficient to resolve differences in their expression levels. digital gene expression of small rnas has recently been demonstrated to generate systematic and reproducible biases  <cit> , highlighting the importance of further quantitative analysis by rt-pcr to confirm relative abundance of small rnas.

we performed qrt-pcr on a subset of  <dig> micrornas, ranging from those frequently detected  to singletons , and including those showing  <dig> or  <dig> sequence mismatches . since all of these micrornas amplified  at high pcr efficiency values, it follows that  <dig> sequencing generates significant sequencing mistakes. for this reason we consider that sequences showing  <dig> or  <dig> mismatches  are likely to represent their corresponding authentic mirnas. we also detected mir <dig> by rt-pcr, even though this sequence was absent from our own  <dig>  and indeed all available online datasets http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/db/. these data suggest that our sequencing depth provided insufficient coverage to identify all pollen small rnas. nevertheless, quantification revealed that the most abundant mirna in our  <dig> dataset, mir <dig>  was also detectable by q-rt-pcr. the relative abundance of all other mirnas was normalized to mir <dig> for both mirna q-rt-pcr and sequencing data . overall there are few significant differences between quantitative rt-pcr and sequencing, and the major differences concern the relative abundance of mir <dig>  which is over-estimated, and mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> which are under-estimated by sequencing. the relative abundance of the remaining micrornas appears in a similar rank order in both assays . this additional step is thus important to verify microrna expression levels independently within samples. we also compared mirna expression between sporophytic and gametophytic samples by quantifying mirna abundance in col- <dig> leaf rna. our data indicate that  <dig> micrornas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir171b,c are enriched in the sporophyte while the remaining  <dig> micrornas were pollen enriched. mir <dig>  mir <dig> and ath-mir <dig> were not amplified from leaf material and may therefore be pollen-specific, or very strongly pollen enriched .

putative novel micrornas
the use of the mircat and target prediction software permitted us to detect putative new microrna candidates . seven of these ten putative micrornas fufil the criteria required for designation as a valid microrna, as set out in  <cit>  since a convincing hairpin structure is predicted for these candidates . one candidate, ath-mir <dig>  seems to have  <dig> different genomic locations and could target cpuorfs and a transcription factor. derivation of the same mature microrna sequence from two or more independent genomic loci is common in plant micrornas, for example mir <dig>  other candidates have only one genomic location and are predicted to target transcription factors , and suvh <dig>  a histone methyltransferase . those remaining putatively target a translation initiation factor  and mei <dig> and a monooxygenase  .

 <dig> candidate sequences capable of forming hairpin structures identified by mircat software. target sequences are shown, and cleavage was tested for  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences using 5' race-pcr.

detection of mirna-derived cleavage products by modified 5' race-pcr
to validate whether these putative micrornas actually cleave the computationally predicted target mrnas in vivo, several of the predicted target mrnas were tested using a modified 5' race procedure that allows detection of uncapped transcripts produced after mirna-directed cleavage. to validate cleavage, we used gene-specific nested primers located a short distance 3' upstream of the predicted site of small rna/mrna binding. of the putative target mrnas tested, only one  produced a cleavage product that corresponded to the predicted cleavage product from ath-mir <dig> activity . this result clearly validates ath-mir <dig> as a novel microrna and the expression of at3g <dig> appears to be restricted to the male gametophyte according to microarray data . to test independently whether this microrna could have other targets, the mature microrna sequence was used to query an online database of computationally predicted micrornas and their targets . this database predicted the existence of this novel microrna and its targeting of at3g <dig>  but also predicted targeting of another f-box transcript, at3g <dig>  however, we were unable to confirm cleavage of at3g <dig> in mature pollen.

some of the putative micrornas shared predicted mrna targets with known, micrornas also identified in our pollen small rna sequencing dataset. for example ath-mir <dig> is predicted to target suvh <dig>  which is also targeted by mir <dig> identified by sequencing. at3g <dig> was a confirmed target of ath-mir <dig> but is also predicted to be a target of mir <dig>  interestingly mir <dig> was identified as pollen-enriched in q-rt-pcr analysis . 5' race revealed that suvh <dig> transcripts appeared to be cleaved within the mir <dig> binding site identified, although other uncapped transcripts were also identified . nevertheless, cleavage product was not detected at the predicted site for ath-mir <dig>  the transcriptional profiles from microarray analysis for suvh <dig> during pollen development showed that transcript levels peak in tricellular pollen and remain at similar levels in mature pollen . 5' race analysis also confirmed that mir <dig> was present in pollen as the predicted cleavage product of at3g <dig> was detected, exclusively in pollen and flowering plant material .

in mature pollen, cleavage products for suvh <dig> were not detected in the predicted binding site of ath-mir <dig>  in contrast to suvh <dig> they were not found for the mir <dig> site either.

identification of tasirnas in pollen
the analysis of our pollen small rna sequence dataset with pssrnaminer identified clusters of small rnas that exactly matched some transcripts, but in a phased manner, which clearly revealed the presence of trans-acting sirnas . our analysis excluded all clusters corresponding to non-nuclear small rnas, structural rnas and protein-coding transcripts to allow the identification of true tasirnas . phased small rnas from four different previously described tas genes  are represented, having around  <dig> to  <dig> small rnas matching their sequence, in both strands . both tas <dig> and tas <dig> transcripts are first cleaved by mir <dig> to initiate the generation of phased sirnas. the presence of this microrna in our dataset thus confirms that conventional tasirna pathways are functional in mature pollen. however, while we were able to detect tasirnas in mature pollen by rt-pcr, their precursor tas transcripts proved no longer detectable - although these were readily amplified from a control vegetative sample .

conservation of microrna expression in tobacco pollen
to examine whether mirna expression in pollen is conserved in a species with bicellular pollen at dehiscence, a sample of highly conserved mirnas were amplified from nicotiana tabacum together with a control small rna  . all mirnas detectable in a. thaliana tricellular pollen could also be detected in n. tabacum mature pollen - with the exception of mir <dig> 

discussion
the use of new generation sequencing technologies to survey small rna populations in flowering plants has largely focused on whole plants or aggregates of sporophytic tissues. a major omission has been the specific study of small rna populations in reproductive tissues and cells. for this reason we have isolated mature pollen from arabidopsis thaliana and utilised  <dig> technology to sequence the small rna component of the transcriptome. the existence of a active late pollen small rna transcriptome had remained in doubt following an early analysis of small rna pathway gene expression  <cit> , but subsequent studies have detected a range of small rnas in late pollen development  <cit> .

known micrornas in pollen
we show here that micrornas are a diverse component of the late pollen small rna transcriptome. previous work has shown that several known families of micrornas could be detected in mature pollen by a modified rt-pcr amplification system  <cit>  but by direct sequencing of small rnas we have demonstrated  <dig> families of previously described microrna families to be present in mature pollen. all of those found by the previous rt-pcr analysis were confirmed by this sequencing approach; indeed, the sensitivity of the  <dig> sequencing approach is such that one mirna, mir <dig>  undetectable in the rt-pcr analysis, was identified. this discovery of mature mir <dig> in pollen confirms a recent analysis of mir319a promoter expression patterns  <cit> .

given that micrornas have only recently been discovered in pollen, there is as yet no direct evidence for a specific role for any microrna in pollen development. however, it has been proposed  <cit>  that microrna function is necessary for pollen development given the presence and functioning of mir <dig> which operates to modulate argonaute <dig> transcript levels in a mechanism maintaining ago <dig> protein levels by a feedback loop  <cit> . ago <dig> appears to be necessary to make normal functional male gametophytes  <cit> . mir <dig> may also be an important contributor to transcriptomic changes in pollen development, playing a part in auxin-regulated development through the elimination of arf <dig> and arf <dig> transcripts after pollen mitosis ii.

our results emphasise the potential importance of mirnas in pollen development and maturation. for example transcriptomic analysis has shown that many transcription factors exhibit dynamic gene expression changes during male gametophyte development  <cit>  and mirnas that target transcription factors are well represented in our sequences . given the presence of mirs targeting transcription factor families such as spl , myb/tcp , arf , ap <dig> , and grf  there can be no doubt that mirs modulate the expression of many transcription factors during later stages of pollen development.

the other major classes of genes regulated by micrornas are those involved in protein degradation  and pentatricopeptide repeat  family. f-box family proteins, a large super- family in plants with  <dig> genes identified in the arabidopsis thaliana genome alone  <cit> , have a major role in targeting proteins for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway  <cit> . indeed, f-box proteins are strikingly enriched in the sperm cell transcriptome  <cit>  and recently an f-box protein  was found to be necessary for pollen mitosis ii and sperm cell formation  <cit> . if there is a need to remove specific f-box transcripts rapidly at this stage of development, it is perhaps not surprising that a microrna that targets f-box family transcripts, mir <dig>  is one of the most abundant in the mature pollen small rna transcriptome; however, fbl <dig> itself does not appear to be targeted by a microrna. the presence of mir <dig>  which targets transcripts of the e2-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme family, also supports the idea that small rna regulation of the protein degradation pathways is important in late pollen. the ppr proteins are another large family with significant roles in plastid and mitochondrial development in plants . they are also known to play an important part in regulating male fertility . their biochemical roles in these organelles include regulating of rna stability  and rna splicing . the relative abundance of micrornas targeting ppr transcripts at this stage of development is interesting, as drastic changes in mitochondrial and plastid development, numbers and function occurs in the male gametophyte. in most flowering plants, these organelles are inherited uniparentally through the female and the male organelles are eliminated by different mechanisms ; it is plausible that dynamic changes in ppr transcripts and protein levels generated by micrornas may contribute to this process.

micrornas that target different epigenetic pathway transcripts are also represented in the mature pollen small rna transcriptome. our results confirm that the homeostatic feedback loop that regulates steady-state levels of ago <dig> and dcl <dig> proteins is likely to operate, as both mir <dig> and mir <dig> were found. interestingly, mir <dig> that regulates argonaute <dig>  was also present, although rt-pcrs were not able to detect ago <dig> transcripts during male gametophyte development  <cit> , nor was ago <dig> detectable in sperm cells  <cit> . this apparent anomaly may be explicable as recent computational work indicates that mir <dig> may target other mrnas  <cit> . another notable discovery was the relative abundance of mir <dig> in pollen. mir <dig> targets two histone methyltransferase transcripts suvh <dig> and suvh <dig>  these proteins have roles in regulating histone methylation and silencing repeats and transposons  <cit> . given reports  <cit>  that the epigenetic silencing of such sequences is derepressed in the vegetative cell of mature pollen , the possibility of microrna-directed down-regulation of these two transcripts is intriguing. indeed, suvh <dig> transcripts decrease from relatively high to undetectable levels after pollen mitosis ii during male gametophyte development , and differential levels between sperm cell and vegetative cell can be detected for suvh <dig>  with enrichment in sperm compared to mature pollen  <cit> . it is possible that mir <dig> may be acting to suppress these transcripts, perhaps in the vegetative cell alone - as seen with ddm <dig> 

remarkably, we did not find the highly conserved mirnas mir <dig> and mir <dig> that are derived from retrotransposons at multiple genomic sites  <cit> . given that mir <dig> and mir <dig> are derived from retrotransposons reported to be transcriptionally reactivated in the vegetative cell  <cit> , their absence from our dataset is perplexing. possibly these retrotransposon transcripts are routed into another small rna pathway and consequently are not processed by the microrna pathway.

the model plant arabidopsis thaliana has tricellular pollen, with pollen mitosis ii and sperm cell formation prior to pollen release from the anthers. some species produce bicellular pollen, where pollen mitosis ii and sperm cell production only occur after pollen germination in the pollen tube. here, we used the mature pollen of tobacco to determine the expression of several conserved micrornas in another dicotyledonous flowering plant with bicellular pollen at pollen release. of the conserved micrornas tested that were known to be present in a. thaliana pollen, only mir <dig> could not be amplified - although mir <dig> transcripts were amplified in a flower bud control. it is possible that mir <dig> is not expressed until after pollen mitosis ii in the bicellular pollen of tobacco, when its targets such as duo <dig> have completed their developmental function  <cit> .

known trans-acting sirnas
in the analysis of micrornas, we found that mir <dig> was present in mature pollen. as four non-coding loci, tas1a, tas1b, tas1c and tas <dig>  are the targets of mir <dig> and templates for the production of trans-acting sirnas, we investigated whether tasirnas could also be detected in the mature pollen. using pssrnaminer, we found that phased sirnas from all four tas loci targeted by mir <dig> could be detected. this is clear evidence that not only is the mirna pathway functional in pollen, but the tasirna pathway is also operating - a view supported by previously-reported evidence for dcl <dig>  rdr <dig> and sgs <dig> expression during male gametophyte development  <cit> .

in pollen, the roles of tasirnas remain obscure. even their function in the sporophyte appears to be subtle as mutants such as rdr <dig> that eliminate detectable tasirna levels do not display dramatic phenotypes . targets for tas <dig> sirnas are ppr and unclassified transcripts, whilst tas <dig> tasirnas target ppr transcripts alone - again suggesting that tight regulation of ppr transcripts is important for normal pollen development, with considerable redundancy between mirna and tasirna regulation of ppr transcripts.

novel micrornas and tasirnas
the poor sampling of male gametophyte small rnas to date and the unique gene expression profile of this developmental stage suggested that our dataset was likely to contain novel small rnas. further, a recent screen of ds insertional mutants in a. thaliana for defects in male gametophyte development and function  <cit>  resulted in  <dig> lines being mapped to intergenic or unannotated regions of the genome, hinting that some of these loci may generate small rnas with specific roles in the male gametophyte. we therefore screened our dataset for potential micrornas using the online uea plant srna toolkit http://srna-tools.cmp.uea.ac.uk/cgi-bin/input_form.cgi?tool=mircat and a database of computationally predicted mirnas  <cit> . criteria required of a 'true' microrna have recently been described  <cit> , and application of these criteria resulted in our identification of several novel microrna candidates.

to explore whether any of these candidate micrornas were able to cleave their predicted target transcripts, modified 5' race experiments were performed on selected transcripts. only one such microrna, ath-mir <dig>  was found capable of directing cleavage of its predicted target, an f-box family transcript at3g <dig>  predicted to be functional  <cit> , ath-mir <dig> is likely to be restricted to pollen as it has not been identified in other reported sequencing exercises, and it is not significantly amplified in leaf tissue by q-rt-pcr. furthermore at3g <dig>  the transcript ath-mir <dig> was most confidently predicted to target, appears to be restricted to male gametophyte development , peaking in expression at the microspore stage. it is also enriched in sperm cells in mature pollen  <cit>  although undetectable in whole pollen by rt-pcr. we show here shown that ath-mir <dig> induces cleavage of at3g <dig> and must be involved in regulating this transcript in vivo at the post-transcriptional level. additionally, this transcript is also targeted by mir <dig> which we also detected in mature pollen by q-rt-pcr, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation of this transcript may be functionally important during pollen development or fertilisation.

our results also reveal the presence of known mirnas targeting pollen-held transcripts, but without cleavage products being generated. however, this absence of cleavage is understandable in the context of recent work which shows that plant micrornas can induce translational suppression  <cit> . in mature pollen, translational suppression may thus operate to inhibit production of protein products from stored transcripts , enabling transcripts to be accumulated during pollen maturation without concomitant protein synthesis. protein production could subsequently be initiated only in the correct developmental context - such as water availability or perception of signals from stigmatic tissue. it is also possible that some late pollen micrornas do not act gametophytically but are transmitted in fertilisation and subsequently regulate transcripts in the zygote and endosperm. an important precedent is the pollen ssp transcript in arabidopsis, which is untranslated in the pollen but on transmission to the zygote, is translated and regulates development of the suspensor  <cit> . similar events may also occur in plumbago zeylanica  <cit> .

limitations and future perspectives
although this study focused on sequencing the small rna population from isolated pollen grains, comprising just vegetative and sperm cells, it is clear that the number of reads  was insufficiently deep, since many of the micrornas were represented by just one or two reads, including the novel f-box targeting microrna that was identified and validated in this study. q-rt-pcr analysis of a range of pollen micrornas has also confirmed that the depth of sequencing was not fully representative of the pollen small rna transcriptome. one reason why this depth of sequencing was not saturating - even for just these two cell types - may be because of the major transcriptomic fluxes which clearly take place during male gametophyte development - affecting both the nucleus and organelles. smaller rnas from the degradation of transcripts generated by these events appear to constitute a high proportion of the transcriptome and may dilute out genuine small rnas. future work on pollen small rnas will require a significantly higher number of reads.

the study is also limited as only the mature pollen stage of male gametophyte development was sequenced. our results represent just a snapshot of small rnas at a time when cell divisions have ceased and development is at a standstill, as the pollen becomes metabolically inactive and dehydrated prior to dispersal. the representation of several mir families only by shorter reads than the mature microrna points to regulated degradation taking place  <cit> . to obtain a clear and comprehensive picture of the temporal dynamics of small rna diversity, sequencing small rnas from different isolated stages of male gametophyte development  will be necessary. this will permit changes in coding transcript levels, as described in  <cit>  and  <cit> , to be correlated with changes in small rnas. analysis of small rnas after pollen hydration and pollen tube growth would also be highly desirable.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that even mature pollen - where male gametophyte development is temporarily arrested and cells are dehydrated prior to dispersal and the commencement of a new developmental programme  - shows a remarkable diversity of micrornas and tasirnas. these small rnas are likely to have contributed to the major transcriptomic changes earlier in development and may also be present to direct changes in transcript abundance and translation during pollen hydration, germination and tube growth - and even at syngamy and in immediate post-fertilisation development. the discovery of apparently pollen-specific micrornas fulfils the expectation that this stage of development not only requires known somatically-expressed micrornas but also uses stage-specific small rnas.
