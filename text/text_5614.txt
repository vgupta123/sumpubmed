BACKGROUND
plants are constantly exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses and have evolved intricate mechanisms to sense and respond to the adverse conditions. phytohormones such as salicylic acid , ethylene , jasmonic acid  and abscisic acid  play important roles in the regulation of plant responses to the adverse environmental conditions. in arabidopsis, mutants deficient in sa biosynthesis  or signalling  exhibit enhanced susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens, which parasitize on plant living tissue  <cit> . et- and ja-mediated signaling pathways, on the other hand, often mediate plant defense against necrotrophic pathogens that promote host cell death at early stages of infection  <cit> . aba is extensively involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses including drought, extreme temperatures and osmotic stress  <cit> . aba also plays a regulatory role in important plant growth and developmental processes including seed development, dormancy, germination and stomatal movement. recent studies have reported crosstalk of signaling pathways regulated by these signal molecules that contributes to either antagonistic or synergistic interactions between abiotic and biotic interactions  <cit> .

a large body of evidence indicates that plant wrky dna-binding transcription factors play important role in plant defense responses. in arabidopsis, a majority of its wrky genes are induced by pathogen infection or sa treatment  <cit> . a large number of plant defense or defense related genes including pathogenesis-related  genes and the regulatory npr <dig> gene contain w box sequences in their promoters that are recognized by wrky proteins  <cit> . a number of studies have shown that these w-box sequences are necessary for the inducible expression of these defense genes. mutant analyses in arabidopsis have revealed direct links between specific wrky proteins and complex plant defense responses. mutations of wrky <dig> enhance plant susceptibility to both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens including erwinia carotovora, hyaloperonospora parasitica, erysiphe cichoracearum and botrytis cinerea  <cit> . disruption of wrky <dig> results in enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens and impaired expression of ja/et-regulated defense genes  <cit> . mutations of other wrky genes including wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  on the other hand, enhance basal plant resistance to virulent p. syringae strains, suggesting that they function as negative regulators of plant basal defense  <cit> .

there is also evidence that wrky transcription factors are involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses. microarray experiments have identified wrky genes that are induced by various abiotic stresses. in arabidopsis, for example, wrky genes were among several families of transcription factor genes that are induced by drought, cold or high-salinity stress  <cit> . the barley hv-wrky <dig> gene is rapidly and transiently induced during exposure to low non-freezing temperature in aba-independent manner and exhibits continuous induction during dehydration and freezing treatment  <cit> . in tobacco, a wrky transcription factor is specifically induced during a combination of drought and heat shock  <cit> . regulated expression of wrky genes during plant stress responses provides circumstantial evidence that implicates wrky proteins in plant responses to abiotic stress. in creosote bush  that thrives in vast arid areas of north american, a wrky protein  is able to activate the promoter of an aba-inducible gene, hva <dig>  in a dosage-dependent manner  <cit> . a number of rice wrky proteins regulate positively or negatively aba signalling in aleurone cells  <cit> . overexpression of soybean gmwrky <dig>  gmwrky <dig> and gmwrky <dig> conferred differential tolerance to abiotic stresses in transgenic arabidopsis plants  <cit> . however, stable or transient overexpression of a gene in transgenic plants can often lead to pleiotropic phenotypes that may or may not reflect the true biological functions of the gene. very recently, jiang and yu  <cit>  have reported that arabidopsis wrky <dig> knockout mutants are hypersensitive to aba responses during seed germination and postgermination early growth, suggesting an important role of the stress-regulated wrky gene in plant stress responses.

arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are pathogen-induced and encode three structurally related wrky proteins  <cit> . we have previously shown that wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> interact physically with themselves and with each other through a leucine-zipper motif at their n-terminus  <cit> . analysis with both knockout alleles and overexpresison lines indicated that the three pathogen-induced wrky transcription factors have a partially redundant negative effect on sa-mediated defense but exerted a positive role in ja-mediated defense.  <cit> . likewise, aba plays a complex role in plant defense response. in arabidopsis, aba counteracts sa-dependent defense against the hemibitrophic bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae  <cit> , but is a signal required for resistance to the necrotrophic pathogens pythium irregulare and alternaria brassicicola  <cit> . in the present study, we report that arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> proteins indeed function in a complex pattern in plant responses to aba and abiotic stresses. the complex roles of the three wrky transcription factors in plant biotic and abiotic stress responses are consistent with the complex nature of their expression, transcription-regulating activities and physical interactions.

RESULTS
altered aba sensitivity of mutants and overexpression plants
to determine their possible roles in plant aba response, we first performed germination experiments to analyze the aba sensitivity of previously characterized knockout mutants and overexpression lines for wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> . in the absence of aba, 100% of wild-type seeds and more than 85% of wrky18-overexpressing plants germinated . in the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm aba, however, the germination rates of wrky18-overexpressing plants were reduced to 50% and 20% of those of wild type, respectively . at  <dig>  μm aba, germination of wrky18-overexpression plants was completely inhibited while almost 80% of wild-type seeds still germinated . thus, overexpression of wrky <dig> enhanced seed sensitivity to aba in germination assays. disruption of wrky <dig>  on the other hand, significantly reduced plant sensitivity to aba as indicated by an approximate 15% increase in the germination rates of the wrky <dig> mutant at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm aba over those of wild-type plants . thus disruption of wrky <dig> reduced seed sensitivity to aba in germination assays. similar results were observed for wrky <dig> from the germination experiments. in the absence of aba, the germination rates of both the knockout mutant and overexpression line for wrky <dig> were similar to those of wild type . when aba was added to the medium, germination of the wrky <dig> mutant was less inhibited than that of wild type. for example, when aba concentration was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> μm, there was only about 10% reduction in germination rate of the wrky <dig> mutant compared to more than 40% reduction of wild type . furthermore, overexpression of wrky <dig> enhanced plant aba sensitivity as indicated by significantly increase in inhibition of germination in the overexpression line relative to that of wild type . increased inhibition of germination in the wrky60-overexpressing lines, however, was much less than that in the wrky18-overexpressing line . by contrast, the wrky <dig> knockout mutant was more sensitive and the overexpression line was less sensitive than wild type to the inhibitory effect of aba on germination .

we have previously shown that structurally related wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> interact both physically and functionally in the regulation of plant basal defense  <cit> . to determine possible functional interactions among the three wrky proteins, we compared the aba sensitivity of their double and triple knockout mutants . germination rates of the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant at relatively low aba concentrations  were higher than those of wild type and were similar to those of the wrky <dig> single mutant . at higher aba concentrations , however, the germination rates of the double mutant were 10-15% higher than those of the wrky <dig> single mutant . thus, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> act additively in enhancing seed sensitivity to aba in germination assays. the germination rates of the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant at various aba concentrations were substantially lower than those of wild type and the wrky <dig> single mutant . interestingly, the germination rates of the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant were significantly higher than those of wild type. however, at certain aba concentrations  the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant didn't germinate as well as the wrky <dig> single mutant . there was no significant difference between wild type and the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> wrky <dig> triple mutant in germination at the various aba concentrations tested .

we also compared the loss-of-function mutants for aba-inhibited root growth. when compared with wild type, these mutants had similar root elongation in the absence of aba . in the presence of  <dig> μm aba, root elongation of the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single mutants and the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant was less inhibited while the wrky <dig> mutant was slightly but not statistically significantly more inhibited than that of wild type . root elongation of wrky <dig> wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutants and wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> wrky <dig> triple mutant was similar to that of wild type .

altered tolerance of mutants and overexpression plants to abiotic stress
aba is involved in plant responses to ionic and osmotic stresses. since the wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants exhibited altered sensitivity to aba in germination assays, we examined root growth of these mutants in growth media containing - <dig>  mpa peg,  <dig> mm mannitol or  <dig> mm nacl. in the normal growth media, root elongations of all the mutants were similar to that of wild type . after transfer to the growth media containing peg, mannitol or nacl, the wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> single mutants and wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant was less sensitive than wild type to the osmotic and salt stress conditions . root elongation of the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutants and wrky <dig> wrky <dig> wrky <dig> triple mutant was similar to that of wild type under the osmotic and salt stress conditions .

induced expression by aba and abiotic stress
wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are induced in arabidopsis plants upon infection by pathogen infection and sa  <cit> . because of their role in plant response to aba and abiotic stresses, we performed quantitative rt-pcr to analyze the effects of aba and abiotic stresses on expression of these three wrky genes. for determining aba-regulated expression, we spraying three-week-old plants with  <dig> μm aba and examined the transcript levels of the wrky genes at  <dig> to  <dig> hours after the treatment. as shown in figure 4a, the levels of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> transcripts increased by about  <dig> and  <dig> fold during the first hour after aba treatment, respectively. after  <dig> hours of aba treatment, however, the transcript levels for both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> were back to basal levels , indicating that induction of the two wrky genes by aba was transient. by contrast, no significant increase in the transcript level of wrky <dig> was observed after the first hour of aba treatment. by  <dig> hours after the aba treatment, the transcript level of wrky <dig> was increased by about  <dig> fold above those of control plants . the elevated levels of wrky <dig> transcripts were still substantial even at  <dig> hour after the aba treatment . thus, induction of wrky <dig> by aba was delayed but prolonged when compared to that of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> 

we also analyzed responses of the three wrky genes to salt and drought treatments. wild-type seedlings  were transferred to a ms growth medium with or without  <dig> mm nacl or  <dig> g/l peg and the seedlings were harvested  <dig> hours later for isolation of total rna and qrt-pcr analysis. as shown in figure 4b, the transcript levels for wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> were elevated by the nacl treatment  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively. after peg treatment, the three wrky genes were also induced  <dig> to  <dig> fold . these results indicated that the three wrky genes were also responsive to abiotic stresses. induced expression of the wrky genes by aba and abiotic stresses have also been observed from previously reported microarray analysis  <cit> .

we have previously shown that pathogen-regulated wrky genes are rich in w boxes in their promoters, suggesting that defense-regulated expression of wrky genes involve extensive transcriptional activation or repression by its own members of the transcription factor family  <cit> . to examine possible mutual regulation among the three wrky genes, we compared wild type and knockout mutants for aba-regulated expression of the three wrky genes. as described earlier, wrky <dig> was rapidly and transiently induced by aba in wild-type plants. a similarly rapid and transient induction of wrky <dig> was observed in the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single mutants . in the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant, induction of wrky <dig> by aba was also rapid and transient but the magnitude of induction was  <dig> - <dig> times higher than those of wild type and their parental single mutants . thus, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> appear to play cooperatively a negative role in the induction of wrky <dig>  the levels wrky <dig> transcripts also peaked at  <dig> hour after aba treatment as observed for wrky <dig> but the decline of wrky transcripts after the first hour was somewhat slower than that of wrky <dig> . in addition, aba induction of wrky <dig> was slightly reduced in the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants . thus, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> modulate positively induced expression of wrky <dig> by aba.

induction of wrky <dig> by aba was relatively slow when compared to that of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> . in wild type, no significant induction of wrky <dig> transcripts was observed during the first five hours after aba treatment. however, wrky <dig> transcripts increased about  <dig> fold by  <dig> hours after the treatment and then declined gradually during the remaining period of the experiments . in the wrky <dig> mutant, the induction of wrky <dig> was drastically reduced, with only a small increase observed after  <dig> hours of treatment . in the wrky <dig> single mutant and wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutant, aba induction of wrky <dig> was completely abolished . thus both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are necessary for aba-induced wrky <dig> expression.

recognition of wrky <dig> promoter by wrky <dig> and wrky40
expression analysis using qrt-pcr showed that induction of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> by aba preceded that of wrky <dig> . furthermore, aba induction of wrky <dig> was almost completely abolished in the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants . these results suggest that wrky <dig> might be directly regulated by wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  to examine this possibility, we compared the promoters of the three wrky genes for presence of the ttgacc/t w boxes recognized by wrky transcription factors. in the  <dig> kb promoter regions upstream of the coding sequences, there was a single wrky box located at  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon of wrky <dig>  no ttgacc/t w box was found within the  <dig>  kb upstream promoter sequence of wrky <dig>  interestingly, there are three ttgacc/t w box sequences within a 19-bp region from position - <dig> to position - <dig> upstream of the translation start site of wrky <dig> . presence of a cluster of w-boxes in the wrky <dig> gene promoter suggests a possible role of wrky proteins in the regulation of wrky <dig> gene expression.

to determine whether the w boxes from the wrky <dig> gene promoter are recognized by wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> proteins, we generated and labelled a double-stranded dna probe containing these three w boxes  . when incubated with recombinant wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> proteins, the probe produced a retarded band in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . a similar retarded band was also produced when the probe was incubated with a mixture of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> recombinant proteins . to determine whether the w-boxes in the pw <dig> probe were important for the recognition, we also tested a mutant probe  in which the ttgac sequence of each w-box was changed to ttgaa . as shown in figure 6c, this mutant probe failed to detect retarded bands when incubated with wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> proteins. thus, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> proteins recognize the w-box sequences in the wrky <dig> gene promoter.

activation of the wrky <dig> promoter by wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in protoplasts
to determine whether the cluster of w box sequences are important for aba-induced expression of wrky <dig>  we isolated a ~ <dig>  bp promoter fragment upstream of the translational start of wrky <dig> and fused it to the gus reporter gene . a mutant wrky <dig> promoter, in which the cluster of the w box sequences from position - <dig> to position - <dig> upstream of the translation start site of wrky <dig> were deleted by overlapping pcr, was also fused to the gus reporter gene . as shown in figure 7a, addition of aba into the protoplasts transfected with the w60:gus construct resulted in about  <dig> -fold induction of the reporter gene expression compared with the non-induced condition. on the other hand, addition of aba into the protoplasts transfected with the mutant mw60:gus construct resulted in less than  <dig> -fold induction of the reporter gene expression compared with the non-induced condition. this result indicated that the w box sequences are critical for aba-induced expression of wrky <dig> 

to determine whether wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> can activate the wrky <dig> promoter in protoplasts, we generated the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> effector constructs under control of the constitutive camv 35s promoter. as shown in figure 7b, coexpression of wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> led to only a very small increase in the reporter gene expression from the w60:gus construct in the wrky18/wrky <dig> mutant protoplasts . on the other hand, coexpression of both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> activated the the reporter gene expression the w60:gus construct by almost 5-fold in the wrky18/wrky <dig> mutant protoplasts . this activation of the wrky <dig> promoter by coexpression of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> was not observed from the mw60:gus construct . thus, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> cooperate in the activation of the wrky <dig> gene expression mostly likely through recognition of the w box sequence in the wrky <dig> gene promoter.

transcription-regulating activity of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky60
functional analysis has revealed that structurally related and physically interacting wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> have a complex pattern of overlapping, antagonistic and distinct roles in plant defense and stress responses  <cit> . this complex pattern may, in part, result from the distinct transcriptional regulatory activities of the three transcription factors. to test this possibility, we employed a previously established transgenic system to determine the transcriptional regulatory activities of the three wrky proteins through assays of a reporter gene in stably transformed plants  <cit> . the reporter gene in the system is a gus gene driven by a synthetic promoter consisting of the - <dig> minimal camv 35s promoter and eight copies of the lexa operator sequence . because the minimal 35s promoter is used, transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring the reporter gene constitutively expressed only low levels of gus and, therefore, it is possible to assay both transcription activation and repression by determining corresponding increase and decrease in gus activities following co-expression of an effector protein.

to generate the wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> effectors, we fused their coding sequences with that of the dna-binding domain  of lexa . the fusion constructs were subcloned behind the steroid-inducible gal <dig> promoter in pta <dig>  <cit>  and transformed into transgenic plants that already contain the gus reporter construct. unfused wrky and lexa dbd genes were also subcloned into pta <dig> and transformed into transgenic gus reporter plants as controls . for comparison, we also include wrky <dig>  a strong transcription activator  <cit> , and wrky <dig>  a transcription repressor  <cit> , in the assays. transgenic plants containing both the reporter and an effector construct were identified through antibiotic resistance screens. to determine the effect of the effectors on gus reporter gene expression, we determined the changes of gus activities in the transgenic plants after induction of the effector gene expression by spraying  <dig> μm dexamethasone , a steroid. in the transgenic plants that expressed unfused wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> or lexa dbd effector, there were little changes in the gus activities after 18-hour dex treatment . in the transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene, induction of the fusion effector after dex treatment resulted in  <dig>  - fold increase in gus activity . a slightly higher  <dig> -fold increase in gus activity was observed in the transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene after dex treatment . by comparison, as previously reported  <cit> , transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene, dex treatment resulted in ~24-fold increase in gus activity. these results indicate that both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are weak transcriptional activators. by contrast, in the transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene, induction of the fusion effector after dex treatment resulted in a 2-fold reduction in gus activity . in transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene, dex treatment resulted in ~5-fold reduction in gus activity. thus, wrky <dig> is a relatively weak transcriptional repressor.

we have previously shown that wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> physically interact with themselves and with each other to form both homo- and hetero-complexes  <cit> . in addition, the three wrky genes are induced by pathogen infection, sa and aba treatment  <cit>  . thus, the transcription-regulating activity of the three wrky proteins may change upon interaction with each other or with other induced proteins. to test this possibility, we examined the effects of sa and aba treatment on the changes of gus activities in the progeny of the transgenic effector/reporter lines after 24-hour dex induction of the effector genes. extension of dex treatment from  <dig> to  <dig> hours increased significantly the expression levels the effector genes . in the transgenic plants that expressed unfused wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> or lexa dbd effector, there were little changes in the gus activities after dex treatment with or without aba or sa treatment . in the transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene, induction of the fusion effector after dex treatment resulted in  <dig>  -fold increase in gus activity . aba treatment had little effect on dex-induced change of gus activity, suggesting that aba did not significantly affect the transcription-activating activity of wrky <dig>  on the other hand, in sa-treated transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene, there was almost no increase in gus activity following induction of the fusion effector after dex treatment. thus, sa treatment almost completely abolished the transcription-activating activity of wrky <dig>  in the absence of aba or sa treatment, a  <dig> -fold increase in gus activity was observed in the transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene after 24-hour dex treatment . again aba treatment had little effect on dex-induced change of gus activity while sa treatment resulted in more than 50% reduction in the increase of gus activity following 24-hour dex induction of the fused lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene . in the transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene, induction of the fusion effector after dex treatment resulted in a  <dig> -fold reduction in gus activity . neither aba nor sa treatment had significant effect on the change of gus activities in the transgenic plants harboring the lexa dbd-wrky <dig> effector gene . thus, the transcription-regulating activity of both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  but not wrky <dig>  was substantially altered by sa treatment.

expression of aba related genes
to further understand how the three wrky proteins are involved in the regulation of aba responses, we compared wild type and the mutants for the three wrky mutants for expression of four genes associated with aba signalling; abi <dig>  abi <dig>  stz and dreb2a. as shown in figure  <dig> for abi <dig>  stz and dreb2a, we observed no significant difference between the wild type and the mutants when the seedlings were grown in aba-less ms grown medium. for abi <dig>  the basal level were slightly but significantly higher in the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutant plants. on the aba-containing medium, we observed modest but significant reduction in expression of stz in the wrky <dig> mutant . there was also relatively small reduction in and stz expression in the wrky <dig> mutant. surprisingly, no significant reduction of the aba-related genes was observed in the wrky <dig> mutant; in fact, there appear to be a small but significant increase in aba-induced expression of dreb2a in the wrky <dig> mutant when compared to wild type .

discussion
differential roles of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in aba and abiotic stress responses
over the last several years, there has been growing evidence that plant wrky transcription factors are involved in plant aba signaling and abiotic stress responses. in rice and barley, aba induces expression of a number of wrky genes in aleurone cells  <cit> . when transiently overexpressed in aleurone cells, some of these aba-inducible wrky genes activate or repress aba-inducible reporter genes. a number of studies have also shown that wrky genes are induced by a variety of abiotic stress conditions and overexpression of some wrky genes altered plant stress tolerance. in the present study, we have determined the role of three arabidopsis wrky genes in plant aba signaling by analyzing the effects of aba on germination, root growth of their knockout mutants and overexpression lines. we have demonstrated that while disruption of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> caused reduced sensitivity to aba, disruption of wrky <dig> increased aba sensitivity for inhibition of germination and root growth . likewise, we have demonstrated that the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants but not the wrky <dig> mutant are more tolerant to salt and osmotic stress . the differential roles of the three structurally related wrky proteins in plant aba and abiotic stress responses were also demonstrated from the analysis of the double and triple knockout mutants and overexpression lines .

the role of aba during seed germination has been extensively studied. the opposite phenotypes of the wrky mutants in aba sensitivity for inhibition of germination strongly suggest that these wrky genes function as either positive or negative regulators of aba signaling. although no altered phenotypes of the wrky <dig> mutant was observed in aba effects on root growth or salt and osmotic sensitivity, which could be due to low sensitivity of the assays, we did observe that the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants exhibited reduced aba inhibition of root growth as well as reduced sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress . therefore, it is possible that altered phenotypes in abiotic stress are related to altered aba signaling in the wrky gene mutants. for example, the higher level of dreb2a in wrky <dig> mutant than in wild type plants under exogenous aba treatment may partially explain the higher abiotic resistanc, considering overexpression of transcriptional activation domain of dreb2a resulted in significant drought stress tolerance <cit> . it is known that the inhibited effect of aba on root growth involves pathways mediated by other plant hormones such as ethylene, auxin and jasmonic acid. the relationship between aba signaling and salt and osmotic stress tolerance is also very complex. in some mutants such as tomato tss <dig> mutant, aba hypersensitivity is associated with osmotic stress hypersensitivity  <cit> . in other mutants such as the tos mutant, aba insensitivity is associated with osmotic stress hypersensitivity  <cit> . these studies suggest that proper levels of aba perception and signaling are important for the abiotic stress tolerance. wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are weak transcriptional activators and wrky <dig> is a weak transcriptional repressor . the relatively weak transcription regulatory activities would make the three transcription factors suitable as either positive or negative regulators for modulating aba signaling and influencing aba-regulated plant growth and abiotic stress responses .

the roles of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in aba signaling are consistent with the aba-inducible expression of the three genes . interestingly, the three wrky genes display distinct expression patterns upon aba treatment. wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are rapidly induced upon aba treatment and are required for aba-induced wrky <dig> expression . on the other hand, aba-induced expression of wrky <dig> is delayed but also prolonged . in addition, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> act partially redundantly in repressing wrky <dig> expression . this expression pattern raises the possibility that the three wrky proteins are part of a regulatory network that modulates gene expression in the aba signaling pathway. upon aba induction, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are first induced and their products could act as early transcriptional effectors to regulate expression of additional aba-induced genes including wrky <dig> . induced wrky <dig> would then act with wrky <dig> to repress wrky <dig>  forming a negative feedback loop. the prolonged expression and the transcription-activating activity of wrky <dig> would allow it to have a relatively sustained effect on aba-regulated gene expression. this interpretation is consistent with the relatively strong phenotypes of the wrky <dig> mutant in aba and stress tolerance when compared to those of the wrky <dig> mutant .

roles of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in crosstalk between abiotic and biotic responses
we have previously shown that single wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants exhibited no or small alterations in response to the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen p. syringae or the necrotrophic fungal pathogen b. cinerea  <cit> . however, wrky <dig> wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> wrky <dig> double mutants and the wrky <dig> wrky <dig> wrky <dig> triple mutant were substantially more resistant to p. syringae but more susceptible to b. cinerea than wild-type plants  <cit> . these phenotypes and additional analysis of sa- and ja-regulated gene expression suggest that these wrky proteins have a partially redundant negative effect on sa-mediated defense but exerted a positive role in ja-mediated defense. likewise, we have shown in this report that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> positively regulate while wrky <dig> negatively regulates plant aba response . as aba is known to counteract sa-defense  <cit>  but function as a signal in ja-mediated defense against necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> , the roles of these three wrky proteins in plant defense and aba and stress responses might be mechanistically linked. this notion is particularly attractive for wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  which might negatively impact sa-dependent defense through positively modulating aba signaling. on the other hand, wrky <dig> antagonized wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in aba response but functions partially redundantly with wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in sa-dependent defense. as will be discussed later, wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> interact with themselves and with each other to form distinct complexes that may differ in both dna-binding and transcription-regulating activities. the interacting partners of wrky <dig> formed during pathogen infection might not be the same as those in aba-treated plants and, therefore, may function in distinct manners during plant defense and stress responses.

molecular basis of functional interactions among wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky60
we have previously shown that through a leucine-zipper motif present at the n-terminus of the three proteins, wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> interacts with themselves and with each other to form both homo-complexes and hetero-complexes with altered dna binding activities  <cit> . in the present study, we have shown that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> act as weak transcriptional activators and wrky <dig> is a transcriptional repressor in plant cells . furthermore, we have shown that sa treatment can diminish or reduce the transcription-activating activity of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> . thus, the three wrky proteins may form a range of protein complexes with distinct dna-binding and transcription-activating or -repressing activities. the complex pattern of dna binding and transcription regulatory activities of the three wrky proteins may explain their complex biological roles in plant defense and stress responses.

in plant defense responses, analysis of t-dna insertion mutants indicated that wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> have redundant repressor function in plant defense against virulent hemibiotrophic p. syringae and biotrophic golovinomyces orontii  <cit> . genome-wide gene expression profiling experiments also showed that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> have a redundant role in repressing a subset of  <dig> genes associated with pamp-triggered immunity  <cit> . the redundant roles of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> as repressors of plant defense genes are consistent with the demonstrated repressing activity of wrky <dig> but not with the transcription-activating activity of wrky <dig>  however, we have also shown that after treatment with sa, which is elevated in pathogen-infected plants, the transcription-activating activity of wrky <dig> is largely diminished . under such conditions wrky <dig> may compete for binding to promoter sequences with other pathogen-induced wrky proteins with stronger transcription-activating activities, thereby preventing strong expression of the target genes. in the absence of sa treatment or pathogen infection, on the other hand, wrky <dig> may function as a positive regulator of plant disease resistance by acting as an activator of plant defense genes as observed in transgenic wrky18-overexpressing plants  <cit> . the positive role of wrky <dig> as a positive regulator of disease resistance and activator of defense gene would be antagonized by the transcription-repressing wrky <dig> if they are co-exppressed. indeed, we have previously observed that potentiated defense responses in wrky18-overexpressing arabidopsis plants are abolished by co-overexpression of wrky <dig> in the same transgenic plants  <cit> .

the differential roles of the three wrky proteins in plant responses to aba and abiotic stress conditions are correlated with their distinct transcriptional regulatory activities. wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> act as transcriptional activators and functional as positive regulators of plant aba and abiotic stress responses. by contrast, wrky <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor and functional as a negative regulator of plant aba responses. thus, it is mostly likely that the roles of the three wrky proteins in plant aba and stress responses are mediated by their activities in activating or repressing plant genes involved in aba and stress signaling.

aba-induced expression of wrky <dig> is severely compromised in both the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single mutants . thus, both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are important for aba-induced wrky <dig> expression. in the promoter of wrky <dig>  there is a cluster of three w boxes within a  <dig> bp region , which are important for aba-induced expression of wrky <dig> in protoplasts . using emsa, we have shown that the cluster of w boxes in the wrky <dig> gene promoter is recognized by both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> . protoplast transfection assays further showed that only co-overexpression of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> but not wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> alone led to activation of the wrky <dig> gene promoter and this activation of wrky <dig> was dependent on the cluster of three w boxes in its promoter . it is possible that upon aba treatment, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are first induced and cooperative binding of induced wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> or binding of a wrky18/wrky <dig> heterocomplex to the cluster of w boxes in the wrky <dig> promoter is necessary for the subsequent induction of wrky <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that mutants and overexpression lines for arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> genes have altered phenotypes in plant sensitivity to aba, salt and osmotic stress. thus, the three wrky transcription factors play roles in both plant biotic and abiotic stress responses. additional studies of their expression, dna binding and transcription-regulating activities strongly suggest that the three wrky transcription factors form a highly interacting regulatory network that modulates gene expression in both plant defense and stress responses.
