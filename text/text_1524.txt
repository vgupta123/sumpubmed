BACKGROUND
nol <dig> is a predicted  <dig> kda,  <dig> amino acid protein with no significant homologies to other characterized proteins that localizes to the nucleus and nucleoli of cells. nol <dig> localizes to 6p <dig>  a region with frequent loss of heterozygosity  in a number of cancers, including hormone-refractory breast carcinoma, leukemia, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, retinoblastoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and cervical cancer   <cit> . using cc as a model for investigation, where loh of 6p <dig> is the most common allelic loss in this neoplasm  <cit> , we demonstrated that reintroduction of nol <dig> suppresses in vivo tumor growth by 95%  <cit> . this suppression is due in part to the induction of an anti-angiogenic phenotype via decreased expression of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor  and increased expression of the inhibitor of angiogenesis thrombospondin- <dig> .

one of the important features that differentiate eukaryotic from prokaryotic cells is the presence of intracellularly distinct compartments and organelles such as the nucleus, nucleolus and mitochondria. the rapid exchange of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is a vital process in eukaryotic cells, and this occurs through the nuclear pore complex , a large macromolecular structure embedded in the double membrane of the nuclear envelope  <cit> . small molecules such as ions and some small proteins can move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by passive diffusion through the npc. however, proteins larger than ~ <dig> kda typically cross the npc in a carrier-mediated fashion  <cit> . this active nuclear transport of proteins is mediated by specific amino acids sequences, which are referred to as nuclear localization signals  and nuclear export signals . the classical nlss contain a cluster of basic amino acids, while classical ness contain stretches of hydrophobic, leucine-rich residues. the best-described nuclear import pathway is driven by the so-called classical nls . this signal is typically lysines  or arginines , that are organized as a single-stretch monopartite nls: 4- <dig>  or as a bipartite nls in which there are two small clusters typically separated by ten to twelve amino acids 2x10- <dig>  the sv <dig> large-t antigen  and nucleoplasmin  cnls are the prototypical mono- and bipartite cnls  <cit> . recently, a tripartite nls, consisting of three clusters of basic residues separated by two spacer peptides, has also been described  <cit> . finally, a fourth type of nls contains two to four dispersed basic residues contiguous to hydrophobic amino acids  <cit> . the active transport of proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus is facilitated by the karyopherin/importin family of carrier proteins. during classical nuclear import, nlss are typically recognized in the cytoplasm by a heterodimeric complex consisting of importin α and β with the α-subunit providing the nls binding site. the nls protein-receptor complex docks to the nuclear pore complex via importin β and is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy-dependent mechanism  <cit> . once the import complex reaches the nucleus, it is dissociated by rangtp. binding of rangtp to importin β can cause a conformational change, resulting in the release of the importin α/cargo complex  <cit> . recent modeling studies have shown that some cargo proteins can also bind directly to β -karyopherins  <cit> .

while active transport mechanisms are required for nuclear localization, targeting to the nucleolus has been shown to depend on interactions with nucleolar constituents. nucleolar localization sequences  have been shown to represent binding domains with resident nucleolar proteins, rrna, and other nucleolar components and function more as retention rather than targeting signals  <cit> . the affinity and stability of these interactions among nucleolar proteins has been shown to have functional consequences that are reflected in the dynamics of their nucleolar localization. many ribosomal proteins show higher immobility and slower recovery compared to processing and transcriptional factors, and these differences have been attributed to the stability and duration of their nucleolar functions  <cit> . mutations, truncations, and changes in posttranslational modifications that have functional consequences have also been shown to affect the immobility and recovery of classic nucleolar proteins such as npm  <cit> . together, these observations suggest the nucleolar localization is a factor of the affinity, stability, and abundance of nucleolar interactions and that the dynamics of nucleolar occupancy are a reflection of potential functions within the nucleus and nucleolus.

the purpose of this work was to determine the mechanism by which nol <dig> was transported into the nucleus, identify the minimal functional sequences required for nol <dig> nuclear translocation, and the relative influence each of these sequences may have on the rate and efficiency of localization. we further wished to define the elements responsible for the nucleolar localization of nol <dig> and characterize the dynamics of this targeting. together, the aim of this paper was to define the mechanism responsible for localization of nol <dig> within the cell and the functional consequences of the different components that comprise that mechanism.

RESULTS
nol <dig> is imported into the nucleus via an energy-dependent, nucleoporin-mediated mechanism
nol <dig> is predicted to have a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. some proteins of this size have been reported to enter the nucleus through passive diffusion, while others require active nls-mediated transport. to distinguish between an active transport and a passive diffusion mechanism of nuclear localization for nol <dig>  we subjected gfp-tagged nol <dig> to an in vitro transport assay using permeabilized hela cells  <cit> . in this assay, the cytoplasmic membranes are permeabilized with digitonin, which depletes the cells of their soluble endogenous cytosolic factors while leaving the nuclear membrane intact. in this fashion, the nuclear import of gfp-tagged proteins can be studied under various conditions. in these experiments, digitonin-permeabilized hela cells were incubated with gfp-tagged nol <dig> under various conditions to assay the mechanism of its localization. nol7-gfp alone was not sufficient for nuclear import . addition of cytosolic extract or atp alone was also insufficient for transport , suggesting that nol <dig> localization is energy and complex dependent. at 4°c or in the presence of heat-inactivated cytosol, nol7-gfp was restricted to the cytoplasm , demonstrating that nol <dig> requires cytosolic proteins and is localized via an active transport mechanism. at physiologic temperature, combination of cytosol and atp was sufficient for nol <dig> nuclear localization . however, this was blocked by pretreatment with wheat germ agglutinin  . together, these controls demonstrate that nol <dig> is actively targeted to the nucleus and nucleolus via an energy-dependent, nucleoporin-mediated mechanism.

protein prediction programs identify distinct biochemical domains and putative nlss in nol7
database analysis of the full length sequence of human nol <dig>  utilizing the protein domain prediction programs psort  <cit> , targetp  <cit> , saps  <cit>  and netnes  <cit> , identified five distinct biochemical domains and four putative nlss within nol <dig> . saps analysis revealed the existence of four highly basic regions and one acidic domain which correlates with its high pi of  <dig> . stretches of highly basic residues have been shown to participate in nucleic acid binding, nuclear transport, and may contribute to the tumor suppressive function and localization of nol <dig> . while nol <dig> lacks homology to other known proteins and domains, the significant sequence conservation among its orthologs suggests a consistent evolutionary role. in particular, four long stretches of basic amino acids are particularly conserved throughout evolution . not coincidently, the prediction programs also identified potential nlss within these basic biochemical domains. however, nol <dig> was not predicted to contain any ness. putative sequence   <dig>  amino acids 1- <dig> appeared to be a monopartite nls, while ps <dig>  amino acids 88- <dig> was predicted to be an example of the recently described tripartite nls. ps <dig>  amino acids 144- <dig> appeared to be bipartite nls and ps <dig>  amino acids 242- <dig>  was predicted to be a bipartite nls .

analysis of potential sequence conservation of each of the four putative nol <dig> nlss among its orthologs was performed using blast and aligned by the clustalw method . significant evolutionary conservation between mammalian species homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, macaca mulatta, bos taurus, canis familiaris, rattus norvegicus, and mus musculus was observed not only for the nls regions for the full-length protein as well. less striking but still significant homology was also seen in gallus gallus, tetraodon nigroviridis, danio rerio, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. while some stretches of the full-length protein showed typical divergence of the sequence, the basic stretches of residues that comprised the putative nlss were remarkably conserved. in particular, ps <dig>  which is composed of three basic residues contiguous to hydrophobic amino acids, showed highly significant homology between all of the nol <dig> orthologs. this suggests that ps <dig> may target nol <dig> to the nucleus despite its dispersed amino acid sequence.

interestingly, no homology could be detected between nol <dig> and any other proteins or domains. further, despite the significant conservation between human nol <dig> and its putative orthologs, no functional role can be extrapolated for nol <dig>  with the exception of s. cerevisiae ortholog bud <dig>  no functional data exists for any of these proteins. in the case of the putative yeast ortholog, initial studies suggest that the u <dig> snorna function of bud <dig> is not conserved, as nol <dig> is incapable of interacting with major bud <dig> cofactors that regulate its activity . further, no similarity could be detected between nol <dig> and other characterized proteins of any species, either in the context of the full-length nol <dig> or for shorter stretches of the protein. taken together, this data suggests that nol <dig> is a critical protein in higher eukaryotes that may function in a specialized manner. furthermore, the correlation between the regions of strongest sequence conservation and predicted nlss suggests the localization and function of nol <dig> may be linked.

nol <dig> contains three functional nlss that translocate cytoplasmic pk into the nucleus
in order to determine the functionality of the four putative nlss, we first generated a series of n- and c- terminal deletion mutants of nol <dig> with an ha tag that were transiently expressed in hela and 293t cells . the subcellular localization of the truncations was visualized by immunofluorescence with dapi costaining of the nucleus. while the majority of the deletion constructs retained nuclear localization, a deletion construct lacking all four pss  was cytoplasmic . further, ps <dig> and ps <dig> were shown to function individually as nlss, as constructs missing ps <dig>  ps <dig>  and ps <dig>  or ps <dig>  ps <dig>  and ps <dig>  were nuclear localized.

while these results demonstrated that ps <dig> and ps <dig> were sufficient to target nol <dig> to the nucleus, we sought to further clarify the role of ps <dig> and ps <dig>  therefore, five additional truncations were cloned together with inactivating mutations in the region of ps <dig> . ps <dig> was found to be sufficient for nuclear localization of nol <dig>  but a construct containing only an intact ps <dig>  remained in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the putative sequence of ps <dig> is not a functional nls.

to specifically determine if the three candidate nlss were sufficient to target proteins for nuclear import and further confirm that ps <dig> was not a functional nls, the localization of a series of fusion constructs containing each putative nls sequence and the cytoplasmic protein pk was evaluated. ps <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were cloned in frame with the c- terminus of the pk bearing an n-terminal myc tag and transiently transfected into hela cells . the subcellular localization of the chimeric proteins was visualized using an α-myc monoclonal antibody and cy3-conjugated secondary, with dapi costaining for visualization of the nucleus. both wild-type myc-tagged pk protein and the ps3-pk fusion were seen exclusively in the cytoplasm . in contrast, pk-ps <dig>  pk-ps <dig>  and pk-ps <dig> localized predominately to the nucleus . taken together, these results from the truncation and ps-pk fusion experiments confirm that ps <dig> is not a functional nls while ps <dig>  ps <dig>  and ps <dig> are functional nuclear localization signals. furthermore, the data demonstrate that each nls is capable of translocating a cytoplasmic protein into the nucleus independently. from this point forward, we will therefore refer to ps <dig>  ps <dig>  and ps <dig> as nls <dig>  nls <dig>  and nls <dig>  respectively.

identification of the amino acids required for functionality of each nls
the deletion and pk fusion constructs demonstrated the regions within nol <dig> that are individually capable of driving nuclear localization, but do not define the specifc sequence elements that comprise the individual nlss. to specifically define the minimal amino acids required for functionality of each nls, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert the basic amino acids of interest  to the nonpolar, electrically neutral amino acid alanine in each of the nlss. within each sequence, three individual basic amino acids  or clusters of basic amino acids  were identified and mutated individually to determine their relative contribution to the functionality of the nls. each intact nls and the mutant nlss were cloned in-frame with pk bearing an n-terminal myc tag . as before, fusion with all three wild type nlss resulted in nuclear localization of pk . mutation of any one of the three basic residues of nls <dig> abolished nuclear localization, suggesting that each of these amino acids is critical for functionality of nls <dig> . for nls <dig>  loss of the second or third cluster of basic residues resulted in cytoplasmic localization, while loss of the first basic cluster had no effect on nuclear localization of pk . these mutations suggest that the minimal region required for nuclear localization directed by nls <dig> resides within residues 95- <dig>  consistent with our predictions, both basic clusters of nls <dig> were required for nuclear localization , suggesting that nls <dig> is a monopartite sequence while both nls <dig> and nls <dig> are bipartite sequences. taken together, these data confirm the functionality of the nlss and define the specific amino acids present in each of the individual nls that are required for the nuclear import of pk.

while experiments using individual nls fused to pk are useful, there are several limitations to these types of studies. for example, burgess et al  <cit>  demonstrated that ebna3b has three functional nlss when investigated in truncation experiments but only two were found to be functional in the context of the full-length protein. to determine the contributions of each nls within full-length gfp-tagged nol <dig>  the arginine and lysine residues in each nls were mutated to alanine . the subcellular localization of the constructs was visualized using by gfp fluorescence, with dapi costaining of the nucleus. mutation of all three nlss resulted in cytoplasmic localization of nol <dig> but retention of only one nls was sufficient for nuclear localization . taken together, these results demonstrate that nol <dig> has three functional nls that can independently cause translocation of full length nol <dig> 

each nls contributes differentially to the rate and efficiency of nol <dig> nuclear import
while each nls was shown to be independently capable of directing nuclear transport of nol <dig>  it was unclear what the relative contribution of each signal to this function might be. to address this question, we determined the rate and efficiency of nuclear import for each nls construct. while fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  has been employed previously for measuring the rate of import, this method is limited to small bleaching areas and measures a combination of active nuclear import and nucleoplasmic diffusion, the magnitude of which can vary greatly between proteins  <cit> . in most cases, the nuclear diffusion can be considered equivalent among different constructs of the same protein. however, subnuclear targeting of proteins within the nucleus affects their nuclear diffusion and can no longer be discounted in the calculation of rate by frap. as mutant constructs of nol <dig> are differentially localized to the nucleoplasm and nucleolus, a different approach needed to be applied to investigate the role of different nlss in the rate of nuclear import that would not be influenced by mobility within the nuclear compartment. therefore, two complementary methods were adapted to measure both rate and efficiency of nol <dig> nuclear import, based on quantitative immunofluorescence methods previously established in the literature  <cit> . in both cases, ha-tagged nol <dig> constructs were transfected into hela cells and imaged by immunofluorescence against the ha tag. using imagej software, the fluorescence intensity was measured and reported as a ratio of nuclear to total fluorescence. while previous reports typically utilize the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, we normalized to total cell fluorescence to accommodate differences in subnuclear localization and expression level between the different mutant constructs.

for the efficiency experiments, data was collected twenty hours after transfection, when import had reached steady-state equilibrium . it was found that wt nol <dig> was most efficiently localized to the nucleus, and the strictly nucleoplasmic mutant n <dig>  was least efficiently targeted. the single mutants demonstrated nearly 10% more efficient nuclear targeting than the double mutants, with a p-value of  <dig> ×10- <dig>  the most dramatic loss in targeting efficiency was observed upon the combined loss of nls <dig> and nls <dig>  with over a 15% decrease in efficiency for n <dig> compared to wt nol <dig> and over 10% decrease compared to all other mutants. this decrease was highly significant, with a p-value of  <dig> ×10- <dig> compared to wt nol <dig> and  <dig> ×10- <dig> and  <dig> ×10- <dig> compared to the other double mutants n <dig> and n <dig>  respectively. together, these observations suggest that nls <dig> and nls <dig> are the major sequences involved in the efficient targeting of nol <dig> to the nucleus.

to determine the rate of nuclear import, a similar approach was used, this time measuring the relative nuclear fluorescence intensity over a four-hour time course. to ensure that this rate represented strictly nuclear import, the increase in fluorescence intensity was measured prior to the establishment of steady-state nol <dig> levels. to determine the time frame for measurement, we transfected cells with gfp-tagged wild type nol <dig> and measured the time posttransfection when fluorescent signal can first be detected until it accumulates to a steady-state level. it was determined that nol <dig> protein is detectable  <dig> hours posttransfection, and its accumulation reaches steady-state levels approximately  <dig> hours after transfection . therefore, the rate was calculated as the change in fluorescence intensity at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours posttransfection . loss of even one nls had a significant effect on the change in rate, regardless of identity. the single nls mutants had a significantly higher rate of import than the double mutants . the most dramatic decrease was observed with the n <dig> mutant, which was imported at a rate nearly 80% less than wt nol <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig> ×10- <dig>  this suggests that each nls plays a unique role in the targeting of nol <dig>  together with efficiency, this suggests that nls <dig> and nls <dig> in combination are critical for efficient and rapid targeting of nol <dig> to the nucleus.

nls <dig> and nls <dig> of nol <dig> comprise domains that are required for nucleolar localization
it has been previously demonstrated that nol <dig> localizes to the nucleolus via colocalization with the nucleolar protein npm  <cit> . in the analysis of the nlss, it was noted that loss of nls <dig> and nls <dig> together abolished the nucleolar but not nuclear localization of nol <dig> . interestingly, nls <dig> also significantly decreased both the rate and efficiency of nol <dig> nuclear transport . to identify the possible nols within these signals, systematic mutation of the basic residues within nls <dig> or nls <dig> was undertaken . restoration of any basic cluster in nls <dig> or in nls <dig> was sufficient to restore nucleolar localization, suggesting that these regions are capable of individually functioning as nolss . thus, nol <dig> contains at least four separate nolss within its nuclear targeting sequences that are individually capable of directing nucleolar localization.

nol <dig> demonstrates rapid recovery but low mobility within the nucleolus
protein occupancy and complex assembly in subnuclear bodies has been shown to relate to function for a majority of proteins  <cit> . therefore, the nucleolar occupancy of nol <dig> was evaluated by frap. the occupancy was described by the recovery half life  and mobile fraction  of gfp-fusion constructs. in order to define an upper and lower limit for nucleolar protein mobility, nol <dig> was evaluated with the controls ncl, a freely diffusing nuclear/nucleolar shuttle with functions in both the nucleus and nucleolus, and rps <dig>  a low-mobility resident nucleolar protein . these proteins represent typical controls within the literature and allow for comparison to other dynamic studies  <cit> . the t1/ <dig> of nol <dig> was found to be most similar to a shuttling protein such as ncl, suggesting that nol <dig> can freely exchange with the nucleoplasm . conversely, the immobile fraction  of nol <dig> was found to be most similar to an immobile, complexed nucleolar protein like rps <dig> . this is consistent with previous reports describing the nucleolar occupation of a number of nucleolar proteins, including npm, ncl, and rps <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that a large pool of nucleolar nol <dig> is functionally occupied in a nucleolar complex, while the free protein is able to shuttle rapidly between subnuclear compartments. compared to literature reports, this data indicates that nol <dig> is most similar to proteins with multiple nuclear and nucleolar roles like npm, which is both a nucleolar shuttle and associates in functional nucleolar complexes, than either ncl or rps <dig>  further, these data suggest that nol <dig> shuttles between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm and may play a functional role in both compartments.

nol <dig> localization is dynamically regulated by changes in rna composition
the shuttling of nol <dig> between the nucleus and nucleolus suggested that specific interactions within these compartments may regulate the nucleolar occupancy of nol <dig>  due to the highly basic nature of the protein, it was hypothesized that subnuclear localization of nol <dig> may be due to interactions with nucleic acids. to investigate, various cell treatments were employed to change the abundance of different nucleic acid species . cells overexpressing gfp-tagged nol <dig> were treated with rnase, dnase, actinomycin d , or α-amanitin and visualized by fluorescence microscopy for changes in subcellular localization. rnase treatment resulted in nucleolar loss and nucleoplasmic accumulation of nol <dig>  while cells treated with dnase did not show any significant change. culture of mammalian cells in low doses of actd selectively inhibit rrna synthesis while having no effect on trna, 5s rrna, nuclear rna and mrna synthesis  <cit> . similarly, treatment with low doses of α-amanitin inhibits rnapii and subsequent mrna synthesis without affecting the abundances of other rna species. loss of these specific rna species has been shown to selectively deplete their rna-binding protein counterparts from different cellular compartments, enabling visualization of binding activities that may participate in protein localization  <cit> . upon treatment with actd, nol <dig> was found to translocate to the nucleoplasm. upon treatment with α-amanitin, no change in the nucleolar localization of nol <dig> was observed. however, the nucleoplasmic localization of nol <dig> previously observed was absent. this data suggests that targeting of nol <dig> to both the nucleus and nucleolus results in multiple rna-dependent interactions.

discussion
active nuclear transport involves complex interactions between the transport machinery and protein cargo, mediated in part through nlss. typically composed of discrete patterns of basic residues, these sequences are recognized by the transport machinery and can vary in their affinity, rate, and efficiency of localization, which in turn can influence the function and biologic relevance of the cargo protein in different physiologic settings. here, we have shown that nol <dig> is targeted to the nucleus via an energy- and nucleoporin-dependent mechanism. this transport is mediated by three evolutionarily conserved but distinct nlss. in addition, each nls was found to be independently capable of directing the nuclear localization of the cytoplasmic protein pk or full length nol <dig>  each nls individually and additively contributed to the rate and efficiency of nol <dig> nuclear targeting, suggesting that each of the nlss has differential effects in driving the localization kinetics, likely reflecting differences in the regulation of import. taken together, these data indicate that nol <dig> localization is tightly regulated and may contribute to functions in various cellular compartments.

the transport of proteins and rnas into the nucleus occurs through the npc and is an important step in regulating the subcellular location of a number of different proteins, including transcription factors, signalling proteins, and various enzymes. although alternative mechanisms exist, the classic nuclear import pathway appears to be the predominate method of transport into the nucleus. a recent survey of saccharomyces cerevisiae screened over  <dig> genomic sequences and found that 45% contained classic nlss and nearly 60% of nuclear proteins contained monopartite or bipartite sequences  <cit> . this is likely true across species, as a number of studies have found that the nuclear transport machinery for essential proteins is highly conserved between animals, yeast and plants  <cit> . this observation is certainly true for the three nlss present in nol <dig>  where sequence alignment of the three nlss demonstrated significant evolutionary conservation and aided in the identification of putative targeting sequences. it further suggested that targeting may play a significant role in the regulation and function of nol <dig>  as these sequences were highly conserved across species but demonstrated little similarity to other proteins or domains.

nol7's three functional nlss are located in the n terminus, middle, and c terminus of the protein. while a single functional nls is sufficient for most proteins, the presence of multiple functional nlss is seen frequently among proteins whose function is critically determined by its localization. proteins such as p <dig>  <cit> , e2f <dig>  <cit> , c-abl  <cit> , p14arf, hpv e <dig>  <cit> , brca <dig>  <cit> , most ribosomal proteins including rps <dig>  <cit> , b-myb  <cit> , atf2/c-jun heterodimer  <cit> , pak- <dig>  <cit>  and others have been demonstrated to contain more than one nls. interestingly, many of these proteins are also implicated in cancer, and aberrant or mislocalized protein plays a significant role in the development and progression of the disease. as such, nuclear localization, and the rate and efficiency at which it occurs, has been shown to have many downstream functional consequences for proteins  <cit> .

terry, et al, have proposed a hierarchical regulation to classical nuclear transport via nlss, with multiple mechanisms acting at the level of the cargo, receptors, and npc  <cit> . the existence of multiple nlss within a single protein may therefore provide a mechanism to exploit these different targeting controls for proteins whose nuclear localization is critical for function  <cit> . the first level of regulation involves the npc, and the permeability, stability, and expression of the proteins that comprise this complex can affect the efficiency and targeting of cargo. the existence of multiple nlss within nol <dig> may therefore be used to achieve nuclear localization despite cellular conditions where npc is less accessible. the next level of regulation involves the transport receptors. here, differing accessibility, affinity, competition, and expression of the importins in various cell types and under different cellular conditions can affect transport  <cit> . in this case, the existence of multiple nlss can increase likelihood of transporter interaction regardless of environment, coordinate for better efficiency and rate of localization, or outcompete other nls-bearing proteins for these receptors. indeed, combined loss of nls <dig> and nls <dig> significantly impact both the rate and efficiency of nol <dig> localization, and the presence of more than one nls results in a statistically significant increase in nol <dig> nuclear accumulation . finally, at the level of the cargo, modifications and interactions of the cargo protein itself regulates its own localization. inter- and intramolecular interactions can provide or preclude access to nlss, and modifications within nlss can also affect transport, either inhibiting or promoting import to the nucleus  <cit> . the differential rate and efficiency of localization observed among nol <dig> mutants, particularly in the n <dig> mutant, suggests each nls may participate in different levels of this regulation. in addition, many nlss have also been shown to harbor subnuclear targeting sequences such as nolss. nolss typically represent interaction motifs between nucleolar constituents, making nucleolar localization a dynamic, multidirectional process compared to nuclear targeting  <cit> . our results have shown that nls <dig> and nls <dig> include four nolss. these sequences are composed of basic clusters and each is capable of individually driving nucleolar localization of nol <dig>  whether these regions represent unique binding domains or are functionally redundant to ensure efficient interaction with nucleolar cofactors is unknown at this time.

investigation of the nucleolar occupancy of proteins under various cellular conditions has demonstrated that the kinetics are often highly similar for functionally related proteins  <cit> . in particular, frap analysis of the recovery and mobility of proteins within this compartment has been shown to reflect their functional roles. the nucleolar mobility is typically viewed as a reflection of the stability of the interactions and size of the interaction complex within that compartment, while the recovery reflects the shuttling characteristics of a protein between the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. while many ribosomal proteins are highly immobile within the nucleolus, proteins such as ncl, ubf, and npm have higher mobility and rapid recovery, due to their multiple functional roles in the nucleus and nucleolus  <cit> . frap analysis of the nucleolar occupancy of nol <dig> demonstrates that a large fraction of nucleolar nol <dig> is involved in a relatively stable complex, as evidenced by its small mf. interestingly, free nol <dig> protein rapidly shuttles between compartments. these dynamics, with low mf and high t1/ <dig>  have been demonstrated in the literature to be unique to proteins that functionally interact with ribonucleoproteins  in both the nucleus and nucleolus such as npm  <cit> . together, this suggests that nol <dig> may interact in rnp complexes in both compartments. further support for the potential nuclear and nucleolar interactions of nol <dig> can be observed by the changes in localization for nol <dig> upon specific depletion of nucleic acid species. the pattern of nol <dig> expression is significantly altered by loss of rna but not loss of dna, suggesting that nol <dig> is an rna-associated protein, either directly or through rnp complexes. further, changes in rrna and mrna abundance affected the abundance of nol <dig> in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, respectively, suggesting that nol <dig> may be participating in distinct functional complexes within each compartment. whether this is a direct effect of rrna and mrna interaction, or an indirect consequence of changes in the transcriptome of the cell remains to be investigated. however, together these observations indicate that the rna abundance within the cell can influence the localization of nol <dig> protein, and the dynamics of this localization is similar to the kinetics of proteins that play functional roles in nuclear and nucleolar rnp complexes. while it is unknown what, if any, function nol <dig> may have in either compartment, it suggests that its localization is actively regulated and this differential targeting may influence its role in cancer development and progression.

localization and function within multiple cellular compartments has previously been observed for many proteins. in addition, regulation of protein function through localization mechanisms is known to be employed in multiple cancer signaling pathways, including the wnt, tgfβ, and hh pathways. oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as rb, c-myc, p <dig>  vhl, and p14arf have multiple, different functions depending on their localization or sequestration  <cit> . our evidence suggests that like many of these oncogenes and tumor suppressors, nol <dig> may have be regulated through its subcellular localization, and its targeting may be critically linked to its tumor suppressive activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have found that nol <dig> requires cytosolic proteins for active transport into the nucleus, consistent with a classical import mechanism. we have identified three functional nlss within nol <dig>  each of which is independently capable of directing the nuclear localization of the cytoplasmic protein pk or full length nol <dig> and contribute to different degrees to the rate and efficiency of nol <dig> nuclear import. further, these sequences harbor at least four nolss that are independently capable of mediating nucleolar localization. the nucleolar occupancy of nol <dig> is balanced by its rapid recovery and low mobility, similar to other proteins that play multiple functional roles in both the nucleus and nucleolus. further, the nucleolar localization of nol <dig> is dependent upon the presence of rrna, while the nucleoplasmic localization of nol <dig> is mediated by the abundance of mrna. this work provides the basis for further investigation into the levels, activity, and mechanism of regulation for nol <dig> and elucidation of its role in tumor growth suppression.
