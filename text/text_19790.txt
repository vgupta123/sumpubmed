BACKGROUND
repetitive elements comprise ~45%  <cit>  of mammalian genomes and are increasingly known to impact genomic function by contributing to the genomic architecture, by direct regulation of gene expression  <cit>  and by affecting genomic size, diversity and evolution  <cit> . the ubiquity and increasingly understood importance of repetitive elements  contribute to the need to identify and annotate res  <cit> . in recent years, several attempts have been made to automate the process of de novo identification and characterization of res  <cit> . the algorithms take into account the likely evolutionary history of the res – not only genetic drift, but also the processes that lead to the juxtaposition of res  <cit> . because knowing the evolutionary history of each re helps to define the type of re, these algorithms are valuable not only in identifying repetitive sequence, but also in increasing our understanding of the evolutionary role of the identified re. our initial attempt was to identify novel repetitive dna with a program called recon  <cit> , which produced  <dig>  families of res with  <dig> of those having count numbers of  <dig> or more. we decided a different approach was needed that would organize closely related elements in a parsimonious way. in this paper, we describe  <dig> novel porcine repetitive elements and estimate their prevalence in swine and other species.

RESULTS
we identified repetitive elements using a procedure similar to previously published methods  <cit> . first, we used repeatmasker  <cit>  on the bac sequences to mask out previously characterized repeat elements. second, we identified all pair-wise alignments among masked sequences using blast  <cit> . third, we identified multiple copy sequence segments with alignments to many sites . fourth, we clustered sites linked by pair-wise alignments and constructed phylogenetic trees. fifth, excessive variation  in copy number within a putative re caused it to be divided; co-localization of re among many sites caused them to be merged. sixth, we examined flanking sequences of putative re for clues about replication machinery or to consolidate re that should be merged. seventh, we estimated the prevalence of re in an independent set of porcine sequences as well as in the genomes of other species.

our method compared to recon
the bulk of the automated parts of our process, steps  <dig> through  <dig>  were very similar to recon  <cit> . recon does not appear to have analogues for steps  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  we utilized step  <dig> to steer us away from previously characterized repetitive. we utilized the manually intensive steps 5– <dig> to achieve a more parsimonious  than appeared to be possible with recon alone. in this sense, we envision that our method is a complement to recon, not a replacement.

steps  <dig> – 4
thirty-six percent of the sequence was masked by repeatmasker. comparing all unmasked sequence fragments  produced  <dig> , <dig> pair-wise alignments. one thousand five hundred seventy-nine highly redundant sequences  were identified that had a minimum of  <dig> hits for at least  <dig> contiguous bases. sixty putative repeat element families resulted from clustering the  <dig> highly redundant sequences. the repeat element families were labeled mpre <dig> – mpre <dig> . their lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and their copy numbers  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> 

steps  <dig> – 6
the  <dig> original mpres were consolidated into  <dig> because of overlap or co-localization at multiple sites. twenty-nine mpres were absorbed into 31; the  <dig> original mpre identifiers of the longer sequences were kept to maintain provenance. in addition, there were three combinations  of repeats that frequently appeared together in the same order with some variation in their relative spacing. the most consistent group contained two elements – mpre <dig> in reverse complement followed by a small gap, then mpre <dig>  all thirteen times that mpre <dig> occurred, it occurred in this grouping. mpre <dig> occurred  <dig> out of  <dig> times in this grouping. naturally, we concluded that mpre <dig>  and mpre <dig>  were two parts of a longer re that had a variable middle . after examining the alignment in clustalx, we could see that the middle was conserved except for an  <dig> bp deletion in one instance and a  <dig> bp insertion in another. further review of the bacs showed that the  <dig> groups containing mpre <dig> and mpre <dig> sometimes occurred in overlapping regions between pairs of clones in the bac collection, meaning that we only had  <dig> unique loci plus one very unique locus that had a pre1a  inserted into the gap. there was no pattern to the gap in the other instances. we include this longer repeat element in our list of novel porcine repeat elements as mpre <dig>  which is more fully described in a later section.

the final alteration to the list of mpres was the removal of mpre <dig> due to its low copy number in the set of  <dig>  porcine bac-ends supplied by the wellcome trust sanger institute   <cit> . surprisingly, mpre <dig> was found to appear less frequently, only six times, in bac-ends  than in the much smaller portion of the genome spanned by the set of fully sequenced bacs  from which the mpres were derived. that brings the final number of novel repeat elements reported here to  <dig>  although we decided against removing mpre <dig> from the fasta file of mpres, see additional file  <dig> 

step 7
the prevalence of these newly identified res was compared to that of known res. three of the newly discovered porcine res, mpre <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were more common than the line element l <dig> and one, mpre <dig>  was about as common as l <dig> . the other  <dig> mpres have lower count numbers. in the sanger archive of  <dig>  bac-ends, the number of elements for all sines was  <dig> , for all lines was  <dig>  and for all ltrs  was  <dig>  based on repeatmasker. looking specifically at the lines, the most common by far was l <dig> with  <dig> , followed by l <dig> with  <dig>  and l <dig> is third with  <dig> .

these newly discovered repeat elements did not appear to be duplicated genes, line elements or expressed sequence that was transposed by a line element. to address these questions, the mpres were translated and compared  to the genbank nr database and only one strong hit was found. mpre <dig> hit sus scrofa interferon alpha- <dig> precursor with a bit score of  <dig>  so it was eliminated from further consideration as a novel re. for comparison, the highest bit score of mpres reported here was less than  <dig>  the repeats were also compared  to vectors, mitochondrial dna, and trnas. the middle of mpre <dig> did have high similarity to trna-glu; otherwise, there were no substantial high-scoring pairs.

discussion
certain difficulties arise when defining repeat elements. one is that res often are present as mosaics of smaller subsets of commonly occurring sequences  <cit> . another is that res can often sustain considerable mutations, including large truncations and insertions. two extreme examples of this are the truncation of the 5' end during retrotransposition, and the insertion of one re into the middle of another. a third difficulty requiring resolution is that segmental duplication will create very long repeated sequences that do not retro-transpose together, and therefore should be broken up into their retro-transposable component parts. recon, the software for identification of res described by bao and eddy, handles all three of these difficulties  <cit> .

our approach was intentionally a bit more simplistic. we were able to create a much more parsimonious set of re than what we were able to generate with recon. whereas recon intends to recreate the full repeat elements in the way that will make for the best possible additions to the repeatmasker database, as well as aid in the study of the evolutionary history of the repeat elements, our goal was to mask out the most commonly repeated regions of the porcine genome. the technique we found most useful in refining the definitions of the mpres was to plot the frequency of blast hits as a function of position within the sequence of the putative repeat elements. from the criteria used to define them, the number of hits was at least  <dig> across the whole sequence – but many showed a much higher hit frequency along part of their lengths. for purposes of comparison, we applied recon to our pair-wise alignments from step  <dig>  recon divided the  <dig> , <dig> blast hits into  <dig>  potential repeat elements that were then grouped into  <dig>  families. only  <dig> of these families had  <dig> or more elements. note that it is possible for a family containing only one element to correspond to many blast hits. rather than continue with so many families, we found that our method yielded a more parsimonious classification of moderately repetitive elements. one difference between the two methods was that our method required a minimum copy number prior to the formation of families of repeat elements.

the mpres have no clear connections to known proteins. the ncbi blastx results for these sequences were typically a combination of description-less accessions and unrelated proteins in a variety of organisms. that remained true when the dataset was compared to the tigr gene index for sus scrofa  <cit> .

the novel repeat elements were compared to known types of repeats – sines, lines and ltrs – and did not fit the definitions for those classes of repeat elements. because repeatmasker would mask out low-complexity regions, the methods used here would not initially find the tail ends of ltrs. each mpre was tested for nearby low-complexity regions and none were consistently found. one of the characteristics of sines is the presence of trna coding sequence in their  <dig> prime regions  <cit> . only mpre <dig> had a region similar to trna, and that was in the middle of its sequence. lines are best characterized by their two orfs – one coding for a reverse transcriptase and the other for a protein with rna binding activity  <cit> . all the mpres were translated to potential proteins and compared to a comprehensive database . none of the results were similar to the possible translations of a line.

counting repeat elements is challenging
because of the degeneracy of repetitive elements it is difficult to arrive at an accurate count in the target genome. another difficulty in the quantification of repeat elements is that res are often composed of smaller repeat units that occur more frequently than the larger unit  <cit> .

to characterize the prevalence of mpres, we went to an independent data set, the sanger bac-ends from the chori- <dig> library archived at ensembl  <cit> . table  <dig> lists three different measures of prevalence of mpre within these bac-ends. the first measure  gives the number of hits that were at least half the length of the repeat element. an issue here is the typical size of the traces – an average of  <dig> bp. the longer res will tend to be under-counted due to edge effects in the trace archive. the next two measures of count number were calculated by plotting the number of blast hits as a function of position on the re. some of the resulting plots were smooth and flat across most of the re with an expected drop-off near each end. for these "regular" plots the count number was the average value of the middle 90% of the plot amplitude. other plots varied quite a bit in amplitude across the re. this was likely due to sub-repeats that hit in areas of the genome that the whole repeat did not. during this measure of count number there was no lower limit to the size of the hit other than that needed to get the expectation value below  <dig> . these were considered irregular and the algorithm for determining their count number was to take the smallest value on the plot after ignoring the first and last 10% of the plot. a few plots were only mildly irregular, and for those both the regular and irregular algorithms were used with both numbers reported in table  <dig> 

comparing the novel repeat element content across genomes
the sequences of novel porcine repetitive elements listed here were compared  to a recent build of the complete cow genome  as well as against the mouse and human genomes. in the case of mouse, there were no significant similarities found. the comparison to the human genome yielded only one significant hit – a  <dig> bp long section of mpre <dig>  matched once in chromosome  <dig> thousands of bp away from any annotated features. the comparison to the cow genome yielded a variety of results. five of the  <dig> mpres did not hit at all , and three others  had ten or fewer hits , despite the fact that the cow genome contains ten times more sequence than the collection of porcine bac-ends tested. fourteen of the  <dig> mpres appeared frequently in cow as well as pig, as indicated by having at least  <dig> blast hits to the cow genome.

not surprisingly, the bovine hits tend to be shorter than the porcine hits because the mpres were defined from pig sequence and as such would be expected to be more intact in porcine. what is interesting is that in both species the endpoints of the hits have a strong tendency to line up to particular spots in the mpre, as shown in figure  <dig> using mpre <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as examples. sometimes the common endpoints are the same in both species, sometimes not. this could be a result of the repeat elements being comprised of smaller repeat elements, not all of which have the same frequency of occurrence in either genome. the longer mpres often had more than one sub-region with multiple extra hits. this, too, could be evidence of internal repeat structure.

because the collection of bacs spans only 1% of the whole pig or cow genome, we cannot rule out the possibility that all of the mpres have at least one orthologous location in both species. the fact that  <dig> mpres did not have blast hits in any of the cow bacs makes it seem likely that those  <dig> are relatively recent evolutionary occurrences. of the  <dig> mpres that appear most frequently in the cow, only two, mpre <dig> and mpre <dig>  were observed to appear in orthologous locations among the tested set of fully-sequenced bacs.

a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the different integration sites of mpre <dig> from both the cow and pig bac libraries using clustalx , and the output  was then input into r  <cit>  to create figure  <dig>  the sequences that occurred at orthologous locations in swine and cattle are highlighted. as expected, the pig branches and cow branches tend to be separate. it is notable that the most similar sequences that occur in both species do not come from orthologous locations, but seem to be found in loci that originated after the cow and pig ancestral lines diverged. the evolutionary distance between them is represented by the sum of horizontal distances that one must travel along the tree to connect the two sequences. the leftmost part of that path represents a common ancestor. it is not surprising that the two sequences in question have individually diverged a significant amount from the original sequence of the common ancestor at that locus. the more surprising result is that some of the pig and cow sequences are more similar to each other than the sequences at the oldest loci. coincidental convergence is an unlikely possibility. a more likely explanation is that enough copies of the old sequence were created that some of them experienced much less mutation than the diverged sequences at the ancestral locus. the most recent common ancestors  occurred in a narrow window of time  relative to the full extent of the tree . the mrca among the orthologous sites occurred within the same time frame as the other mrca. the tree clearly shows considerable radiation following speciation as evidenced by large genetic distances from mrca to peripheral tips.

a closer look at mpre61
allelic differences or snp can be identified from cases where mpre <dig> sites coincide with overlaps among cvsi bacs. mpre <dig> sites coincide with  <dig> pairs of overlapping bacs,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . in addition, an mpre <dig> site coincided with a group of  <dig> overlapping bacs, including ac <dig>  ac <dig> and ac <dig>  overlapping bac pair  <dig> had two single base differences, and pair  <dig> had  <dig> single base differences and one  <dig> bp insertion/deletion. no sequence differences were observed within mpre <dig> for pair  <dig> or the group of  <dig> overlapping bacs.

to put the apparent allelic diversity rates into context, we examined the genetic sources of the dna used to construct the bac library . the source of dna for rpci- <dig> was a pooled sample with equal contributions from  <dig> male crossbred pigs each comprised of 3/ <dig> landrace, 3/ <dig> yorkshire and ¼ meishan  <cit> . the probability of identifying snp increases with the diversity of genomes sampled. for the cases of  <dig> overlapping bacs, the probability of sampling different genomes is  <dig> %, different breeds is  <dig> %, and one bac of western  origin and the other of meishan origin is  <dig> %. the probability of sampling diverse genomes is higher for the case of  <dig> overlapping bacs. the probability of sampling more than one genome is  <dig> %, more than one breed is  <dig> %, and at least one bac of western origin combined with one bac of meishan origin is  <dig> %. the fact that we didn't observe snp in one of the three pairs of overlapping bacs is not that unusual given that the probability of sampling identical genomes with at least one of the  <dig> pairs of overlapping bacs is 33% . on the other hand, the fact that we did not observe snp within the group of  <dig> overlapping bacs given the relatively high probabilities of diverse genomes being sampled is unexpected.

to bolster the relatively small number of distinct mpre <dig> loci  identified in the cvsi bacs, we further investigated the prevalence and diversity of mpre <dig> by cloning and sequencing pcr amplification products derived from  <dig> pigs sampled from  <dig> breeds . we used primers designed to match the highly conserved parts of mpre <dig> to amplify and clone  multiple and variable loci for the re that are differentiable by size as well as sequence. the different breeds showed indistinguishable smears on denaturing page gels including many different sizes. too many fragments and too many sizes were present to identify allelic differences in sizes among animals. the pcr products were sequenced to yield  <dig> reads that were not bacterial or vector contamination. the  <dig> sequences  were analyzed with clustal x  and displayed in figure  <dig> as a phylogenetic tree. the topology of the tree  is consistent with the estimated copy number of  <dig> sites in the whole genome given in table  <dig>  we speculate that the more similar sequences represented as tips close  to their common ancestor are probably allelic differences at the same locus. on the other hand, the more diverse tips and peripheral nodes probably represent different sites or loci. the amount of sequence diversity presented in figure  <dig> supports the idea that individual integration sites  and alleles of repetitive elements can be uniquely identified by high-throughput array based assays by hybridizing samples to short probes. this demonstrates that repetitive dna with similar properties to mpre <dig>  can be harnessed for genetic and physical mapping  <cit> . this dispels the long standing myth that repetitive dna should always be avoided because it is intractable. our results indicate that some classes  of repetitive dna would be tractable with high-throughput technologies.

mpre <dig> size differences are not randomly distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree. different sizes cluster on different branches of the tree; however, the clustering is not complete. this indicates that insertions and deletions  occurred throughout the evolution of mpre <dig>  and in some cases while the element was still replicating. the incomplete clustering of sizes indicates evolutionary plasticity and as a result recurrent insertions and deletions.

mpre <dig> was further characterized by plotting blast hits of it to the  <dig>  sequences in the trace archive of bac-ends submitted by sanger. these were plotted along with the repeat elements recognized by repeatmasker. the most interesting observations included the fact that three times among the  <dig> hits a pre <dig> was incorporated into mpre <dig>  pre <dig> is a porcine specific sine that is included in the repeatmasker library. several other examples existed of pre <dig> next to a section of mpre <dig>  but the trace end occurred next to the pre <dig>  so that it may or may not have had the continuing section of mpre <dig> on its other side. no other res were found to be incorporated into mpre <dig>  suggesting that mpre <dig> replicated relatively recently. another interesting observation was that the density of res on the 3' side of mpre <dig> was much higher than on the 5' side. to take a closer look at this, we collected the trace sequence 3' of the  <dig> hits that ended near  the 3' end of mpre <dig> . this flanking sequence, ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, was analyzed for repeat content and distance of that content from the end of mpre <dig> . running repeatmasker on the entire collection  of sanger bac-ends shows that the number of sine elements is 75% greater than the number of line elements . the lines tend to be longer than the sines, so the total percentage of sequence occupied by the lines is actually larger . the most obvious feature of figure  <dig> is that lines are significantly over represented on the  <dig> prime side of mpre <dig>  particularly in the region closest to the end of mpre <dig>  for the  <dig> lines that occur within  <dig> bp of the end of mpre <dig>   <dig> are oriented on the opposite strand and  <dig> on the same strand. at this point, there is no way to know which strand of mpre <dig> might be transcribed. we arbitrarily chose one of the strands and used it consistently. because the lines have a particular internal structure, the 5' and 3' ends are well defined. so another way of looking at the result would be to say that the lines occur on the 5' end of mpre <dig>  with  <dig> on the same strand and  <dig> on the opposite strand. either way, there is less strand conservation than would be expected if mpre <dig> used lines as a vehicle for either replication or integration.

CONCLUSIONS
from our experience, it seems that although some available programs may help with the process of identification of res, a level of judiciousness is also required. the blast and phylogenetic analyses are proven to be useful to improve the efficacy, particularly when comparisons are made across species. discovering the re in one dataset and characterizing their prevalence and diversity in another was crucial to our effort.

using an approach similar to previously published work but modified to fit our specific goals and data, several repetitive elements were identified in porcine and bovine genomes that do not exist in mouse or human. these elements do not contain signatures of previously identified retrotransposons, but seem to have undergone replication and mutation. because these elements are in a lower copy number than most of the res that make up mammalian genomes, they could be exploited in mapping or whole-genome association studies. as the porcine genome sequencing effort progresses, we should know more about the distribution, history and possible contribution of these repeats to the genomic architecture in artiodactyls.

the genuine challenge of genome sequencing and assembly would be enhanced with an improved understanding of repeat elements and their distributions, especially those repeat elements that are species specific.
