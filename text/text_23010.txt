BACKGROUND
the success of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is closely linked to a good match of the hla genes between donor and recipient  <cit> . to overcome the odds of finding a matching donor – given the high diversity of the hla system  – many organizations worldwide endeavor to characterize the hla types of volunteers. in  <dig> alone,  <dig>  million new potential donors were registered. typing potential donors upfront for  <dig> loci at high resolution would be highly beneficial in speeding up the search process, thereby saving precious time for patients in need of a transplantation  <cit> . however, due to the cost of high resolution hla typing based on sanger sequencing, many organizations restrict the number of loci typed to hla-a,-b and-drb <dig> or even restrict the number of potential donors to be recruited. after revolutionizing genome sequencing, ngs is expected to also markedly change the diagnostic market. hla typing by ngs has been demonstrated by performing long range pcr in combination with shotgun sequencing  <cit> . however, the required sophisticated sample preparation steps and associated costs make that approach currently more attractive for patient samples than for cost-sensitive high-throughput stem cell donor registry typing. several groups have demonstrated the feasibility of hla typing by short amplicon sequencing on the  <dig> system  <cit> . moonsamy et al. streamlined the workflow considerably by taking advantage of the fluidigm access array technology for performing up to  <dig> ×  <dig>  pcr reactions on a single chip  <cit> . given the improvements in read length to  <dig> ×  <dig> base pairs, the illumina miseq system seemed compatible for an amplicon sequencing approach as well. we have therefore set out to transfer the strategy of moonsamy et al. to the miseq. in contrast to the  <dig> system, the miseq features on-board clonal amplification, thereby greatly simplifying sample preparation and rendering the workflow more amendable for high-throughput routine operation. in addition, the operational cost is greatly reduced, with a more than  <dig> fold reduced cost per read compared with the  <dig> gs flx system. taken together, those features allowed us to develop a high-throughput low-cost hla sequencing workflow that would render typing of the transplantation-relevant genes and exons affordable for donor centers.

RESULTS
workflow
the workflow  consists of three straightforward steps starting with dna isolated from human blood. since we did not find a correlation between the number of reads and pre-pcr dna concentration , we have omitted dna normalization for the sake of cost and simplicity. hla-specific dna amplification by pcr is performed on fluidigm access array microfluidic chips  <cit> . these chips feature the combination of  <dig> samples with  <dig> primer groups for pcr amplification in  <dig> individual 35 nl reaction chambers. before application to the fluidigm chip, the  <dig> samples are mixed with primer sets containing unique indexing nucleotide sequences and adapter sequences to allow direct sequencing of the pcr products on the miseq without the need of additional library preparation steps . we take advantage of the capabilities of the miseq to sequence two indices in addition to the two paired-end  <dig> base pair sequencing reads. using  <dig> bases for each index, we employed  <dig> index sequences for index <dig> and  <dig> index sequences for index <dig>  resulting in  <dig> unique combinations. during each miseq run, we multiplex  <dig> samples. therefore,  <dig> out of  <dig> index combinations are not used in a particular run, minimizing index mis-assignments  <cit> . following pcr, the  <dig> samples of one fluidigm chip are pooled. the pool is purified using solid phase reversible immobilization  bead technology with a lower dna size cut-off of  <dig> base pairs to remove primer-dimer products. the purified pool is quantified by qpcr to adjust for slightly different amplification efficiencies of individual chips. aliquots of  <dig> purified pools corresponding to  <dig> samples are combined, denatured, diluted and loaded together with a spike of 10% phix onto a miseq instrument.

optimization of primers and pcr conditions
the primer sets are key to a successful short amplicon hla typing strategy. we developed primer sets targeting hla-a, -b, -c, -drb <dig>  -dqb <dig> and -dpb <dig>  restricting ourselves to exons  <dig> and  <dig> for all loci . exons  <dig> and  <dig>  represent the antigen recognition site and are therefore regarded as most relevant for unrelated stem cell transplantation  <cit> . however, limiting the sequenced region to exon  <dig> and  <dig> is a compromise which leaves unresolved certain allele ambiguities that are outside this region. since the medical relevance of such ambiguities  is uncertain, they are currently not considered for donor selection in the context of unrelated stem cell transplantation. therefore, in the context of registry typing, to focus on exon  <dig> and  <dig> is justifiable.

hla typing poses a particular challenge for primer selection. despite the enormous diversity, well-balanced amplification of both alleles – independent of the allele combination – needs to be assured. high specificity is required to distinguish several evolutionary related, highly homologous genes. furthermore, to cover the full exons of around  <dig> base pairs, the primers may not be too distant from the exon-intron boundaries. we developed a rigorous procedure based on the rich content of ngs data for testing the primer sets for specificity and even amplification using cohorts of  <dig> samples with known hla type . this allowed us to fine tune the primer sets for optimal performance:

in contrast to sanger based sequencing, using ngs unspecific amplification does not result in noisy sequencing data. due to the clonal sequencing, the unspecific amplification products are easily identified by the analysis software. nevertheless, specificity is preferred to maximize the relevant information of the available reads.

likewise, with regard to unbalanced amplification, the ngs approach is considerably more sensitive in detecting suppressed alleles than sanger sequencing which requires at least 5% to 20% of the weaker allele for detection  <cit> . in contrast, given sufficient read depth, our analysis software “nextype” identifies suppressed alleles down to 2% read count relative to the dominant allele. in addition, to avoid false homozygous results, nextype blocks homozygous calls with less than  <dig> reads . despite the increased sensitivity for suppressed alleles, we went through several rounds of primer optimization to come up with a set of primers with well-balanced amplification independent of the given allele combination . as part of our quality control, every new batch of primers is tested against a set of  <dig> samples to confirm well-balanced amplification, i.e. no second allele detected with less than 20% of the reads of the dominant allele. this set of samples was carefully selected to represent at least  <dig> samples for each allele group targeted by a particular primer in the primer group.

we also monitor the occurrence of artifacts previously reported in the literature: the generation of artificial “recombinant” or “chimeric” pcr products from the two alleles present in a sample. such “crossover” events have been described as potential error source of hla-drb <dig> typing, as particular crossover events of hla-drb <dig> and hla-drb3/4/ <dig> are identical to named hla-drb <dig> alleles  <cit> . we quantified the rate of crossover products . depending on the targeted exon, an average of up to 25% of the matched reads were identified as crossover products . while we are not aware of previous quantitative analyses in the context of hla, our findings are nonetheless in accordance with reports in the context of 16s sequencing  <cit> . since most of the crossover products are generated during the late pcr cycles, the artifact may be reduced by decreasing the number of pcr cycles  <cit>  . however, in the interest of maximum robustness with regard to samples with low dna concentration, we have chosen not to reduce pcr cycles below  <dig> cycles but have rather extended nextype to handle the artifacts properly.

hla allele calling
we developed the ngs hla typing software “nextype” to match the throughput of the workflow. nextype takes full advantage of q values and high coverage to automate data analysis as far as possible without compromising accuracy. statistical algorithms are implemented to a) identify new alleles, and b) distinguish between sequencing artifacts and closely related alleles. currently, more than 95% of the typing assignments do not require any manual corrections. taking advantage of the high number of reads per amplicon and the high quality of base-calls, we have chosen a set of highly conservative parameters for “autotyping”: those typing assignments  do not even need to be reviewed by a human analyst. to qualify for this category , homozygous calls are accepted only if the read count is high enough to safely exclude a potentially suppressed second allele, taking imbalanced amplification of up to 20: <dig> into account. the 18% of typings not meeting the autotyping criteria remain for analyst review and are divided into three categories: 13% require user confirmation,  <dig> % requiring user editing and  <dig> % failed typings. due to the high level of automation, analysis of  <dig> samples  can be performed in less than  <dig> hours by one trained analyst.

validation
we validated the workflow including nextype analysis software by analyzing  <dig> samples of known hla type. all common alleles with frequency > <dig>  in the german population were represented by at least  <dig> samples  <cit> . using  <dig> fluidigm access array chips we amplified  <dig> hla targeted exons per sample and sequenced them in  <dig> miseq runs. in the case of  <dig> sample-loci , data quality was insufficient and these were therefore excluded from further analysis. all alleles of the  <dig> sample-loci that failed were successfully typed by this approach in other samples. therefore, these failures were classified as technical failures independent of hla type. in routine operation those technical failures need to be repeated. those failures do however not compromise hla typing accuracy. subsequent to analysis using nextype, the results were compared with the typing results obtained by sanger sequencing: all ngs nextype results were concordant with the sanger sequences, demonstrating error-free typing for more than  <dig> sample-loci.

routine operation
upon successful validation, we started routine operations. within  <dig> weeks of operations, we achieved a throughput of more than  <dig> samples or  <dig>  sample-loci per week. using sanger sequencing, more than  <dig> sequencing runs  would be required for equal throughput. capacity was increased to  <dig>  samples per week within  <dig> months. the workflow has proven very reliable. analyzing  <dig> early runs, only  <dig> %  of the samples resulted in less than  <dig> reads per sample. depending on the targeted exon, we consistently obtain  <dig> to  <dig> fold coverage  with only  <dig> sample-exons  below  <dig> reads .

comparing the resolution obtained from sanger-based registry typing with our ngs workflow demonstrates that the ngs workflow yields an increased rate of high resolution typings . and this despite the fact that, an average of five gssp reactions per sample were performed and analyzed on the sanger to resolve phase ambiguities as far as possible.

rate of high resolution typing results. resolution of  <dig>  samples typed by the proposed ngs approach in september  <dig> was compared with  <dig>  samples analyzed by sanger sequencing in  <dig>  in accordance with the standards of the european federation for immunogenetics , we refer to allele typing results with no ambiguities in the antigen recognition site as “high resolution”.

CONCLUSIONS
comparing the proposed workflow with conventional sanger sequencing, it is apparent that the ngs workflow is more cost-efficient and easier to set up. in contrast to sanger sequencing, the individual sample needs to be handled only when it is combined with the barcode sequence, loaded onto the access array chip and pooled with other samples after pcr. to exclude sample mix up by design, we have set up  <dig> liquid handlers with barcode reading capabilities. however, the process as such could easily be handled by manual pipetting. therefore, it appears to be an attractive alternative to sanger sequencing even for labs with far lower throughput. given the combined chip and sequencing run costs of about $ <dig> , hla typing by ngs as proposed here seems to be more cost-efficient, starting with as few as  <dig> samples, even when compared with sanger sequencing costs alone. at the same time, it was possible to further increase resolution by sequencing more exons and introns of up to  <dig> targeted amplicons at no significant additional cost. for the purpose of typing for hla registries, we have restricted the number of amplicons to the exons most relevant for the donor search to routinely multiplex  <dig> samples. in high throughput operation, we achieved a cost reduction of more than 50% compared with cost-optimized sanger sequencing. these realized savings lower the cost for high resolution typing of volunteer donors, thus increasing the number of registered donors with the same budget and simultaneously improving typing resolution. both factors should facilitate and accelerate the search process and thus improve the outcome of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
