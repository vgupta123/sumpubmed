BACKGROUND
pine wilt disease , caused by the migratory plant parasitic nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus , is one of the most serious global forest diseases  <cit> . b. xylophilus and its vector beetles are listed as worldwide quarantine pests  <cit> . under laboratory conditions, b. xylophilus has been reported to be sufficient for pwd development  <cit> . however, because of their ubiquitous existence in the pwd environments, some bacteria have also been thought to be involved in the disease development. for example, some b. xylophilus-associated bacteria are beneficial to b. xylophilus growth and reproduction  <cit> , and others have been suggested or demonstrated to produce interesting bacterial traits that may contribute to b. xylophilus pathogenic potential and, ultimately, to pwd development  <cit> .

plant oxidative burst comprises in the production of reactive oxygen species  as a result of the interaction between plant cell receptors and pathogen-elicitors immediately after pathogen invasion  <cit> . being relatively stable and permeable to the cell membrane, hydrogen peroxide  is the most predominant ros in plant oxidative burst  <cit> . in addition, h2o <dig> leads to the formation of the radical oh, which is extremely reactive and for which there is no scavenging system  <cit> . h2o <dig> was found to be transversal in different plant-pathogen systems, being a fundamental diffusible signal in plant resistance to pathogens   <cit> .

plant pathogens have evolved different evasion features to protect themselves against plant oxidative stress   <cit> . bacterial defences include production of extracellular polysaccharides  coating and periplasmic catalases, and cytoplasmic catalase and superoxide dismutases  to counteract ros before and after entering bacterial cells  <cit> . other factors are related to the production of polyesters, poly-  also known as protective molecules  <cit> , or phytotoxins  that are able to manipulate or down regulate plant-defences for bacteria successful establishment  <cit> . in plant- or animal-parasitic nematodes, antioxidant enzymes have been found to be the important weapons against oxidative stress of their plant- or animal-hosts  <cit> . molinari  <cit>  detected different antioxidant enzymes in meloidogyne incognita, m. hapla, globodera rostochiensis, g. pallida, heterodera schachtii, h. carotae, and xiphinema index and their relationship with life stages. robertson et al.  <cit>  and jones et al.  <cit>  have studied, the role of host ros breakdown by peroxiredoxins  and glutathione peroxidases  in g. rostochiensis, respectively. bellafiore et al.  <cit>  reported the presence of several detoxifying enzymes, in particular glutathione s-transferases , in the secretome of m. incognita as means of controlling the global oxidative status and potential nematode virulence.

pinus thunbergii <cit>  and p. pinaster <cit>  are the b. xylophilus-susceptible pine trees found in japan and europe  to respectively, respond to a strong oxidative burst in the earliest stages of nematode invasion. most likely, b. xylophilus has developed an efficient antioxidant system to diminish the deleterious effects of oxidative burst in their invasion and colonization  <cit> , as well as other plant parasitic nematodes  <cit> . our study aimed to understand the tolerance of the b. xylophilus-associated bacteria under the os condition and its interaction with the nematode. also, we explored the bacterial attachment to the nematode cuticle for dissemination purposes.

RESULTS
b. xylophilus and associated serratia in stress conditions
firstly, we examined the os resistance of three b. xylophilus-associated bacteria   <cit>  and a control e. coli strain, op <dig>  compared to the control strain, all three serratia spp. were shown to comparably tolerate different concentrations of h2o <dig> ranging from  <dig> to 40 mm, . moreover, the three isolates were able to survive up to 100 mm h2o <dig>  .

next, we examined the os resistance of the two b. xylophilus isolates with and without bacteria . in the absence of bacteria , b. xylophilus isolates ka <dig>  are more resistant to os than the c14- <dig>  . at  <dig> and 20 mm, b. xylophilus ka <dig> presented 73% less mortality than b. xylophilus c14- <dig>  the difference of their mortality was 32% and 12% in  <dig> and 40 mm h2o <dig>  to test the effect of bacteria on b. xylophilus survival under these conditions, we treated b. xylophilus with serratia spp.  and e. coli op <dig> for 1 h, washed away bacteria by excess and measured their os resistance. in the presence of serratia spp., both ka <dig> and c14- <dig> were able to survive at all h2o <dig> concentrations tested, with mortality rates lower than 10%. similar to the previous results of serratia spp. under the os conditions , there was no significant difference between the os treatments of three bacterial isolates in association with b. xylophilus . serratia spp. pwn- <dig> was selected for further experiments. in the presence of the e. coli op <dig>  the mortality of the avirulent c14- <dig> isolate was higher and similar to that in nematode alone conditions . for virulent ka <dig>  association with the control strain lead to similar results at 40 mm h2o <dig>  at 30 mm h2o <dig>  there was a significant difference with ka <dig> alone , with control op <dig> , although under the same oxidant conditions, survival of e. coli op <dig> was significantly reduced . under the other h2o <dig> conditions, treatment ka <dig> in association with op <dig> was almost similar to ka <dig> alone. in non-stress conditions, all treatments were statistically equal, indicating that the bacteria used were not harmful to the nematodes.

observation of the nematode-bacteria association
after 1 h contact between b. xylophilus and its associated bacteria, microcolonies were found along the nematode body . after extensive washing, bacteria were still present in lesser amounts, and scarcely attached to the nematode cuticle . in order to test if the bacterial adhesion to the nematode became stronger, and if the nematode could uptake bacteria into its body, we performed co-culturing of the nematodes with the gfp-labelled bacteria on the same plate for 24 h. successful gfp-labelling of b. xylophilus-associated bacteria was only obtained for serratia spp. lcn- <dig> and serratia spp. lcn- <dig>  serratia spp. pwn- <dig> were previously found to be multi-drug resistant to the antibiotics available to select for gfp-containing minitransposons  <cit> . after 24 h contact with serratia spp. lcn- <dig>  the density of nematode-attached bacteria was sparse , and also no gfp fluorescence signal was detected in the nematode . taken together, the adhesion of these bacteria to the nematode surface and organs seems to be weak and non-specific.

relative gene expression of bxy-ctl- <dig> and bxy-ctl-2
using the c. elegans catalases  as the search queries, only two catalases were predicted in the b. xylophilus genome, bxy-ctl- <dig>  and bxy-ctl- <dig>   <cit> . both cdna sequences presented open reading frames . the longest orf for bxy-ctl- <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa protein with the molecular weight of ~59kda. the cdna to sequence of bxy-ctl- <dig> encoded a  <dig> aa protein with the molecular weight of ~ 55 kda. both bxy-ctl- <dig> and bxy-ctl- <dig> were predicted as non-secretory peroxisomal proteins. however, according to shinya et al. <cit> , bxy-ctl- <dig> was secreted after pine wood extract stimulation. blastp search for both catalases retrieved very similar orthologous catalases  from different species of caenorhabditis and other animal parasitic nematodes, suggesting the catalases are conserved among the phylum nematoda .

the relative gene expression of catalase genes of b. xylophilus ka <dig> and c14- <dig> with or without serratia spp. pwn- <dig> was studied under stress conditions . after 24 h exposure to 15 mm h2o <dig>  the expression levels of bxy-ctl- <dig> and bxy-ctl- <dig> genes in the b. xylophilus ka <dig> and c14- <dig> were measured . while virulent ka <dig> catalases  were significantly  up-regulated by nearly 2- <dig> -fold compared to the non-stress condition  the expression of bxy-ctl- <dig> in the avirulent c14- <dig> was unchanged and the expression of bxy-ctl- <dig> was slightly reduced  . these results seem to support the observations denoted in figure  <dig>  in the presence of the associated bacteria serratia spp. pwn- <dig>  the relative expression of ka <dig> bxy-ctl- <dig> was highly suppressed , nearly  <dig> -fold less than under non-stress conditions. under the same conditions, ka <dig> expression of bxy-ctl- <dig> was not affected. the expression levels of both catalases in the avirulent c14- <dig> showed no significant induction or suppression. in the presence of control strain e. coli op <dig>  the expression level of bxy-ctl- <dig> in the ka <dig> was induced four-fold under stress conditions, and bxy-ctl- <dig> expression level remained unchanged under non-stress conditions. similar result was obtained for c14- <dig>  in which e. coli op <dig> induced  <dig> times more bxy-ctl- <dig> expression under stress conditions, explaining the results obtained in figure  <dig>  the expression levels of bxy-ctl- <dig> were also induced , nearly  <dig> -fold .

discussion
tolerance to host-mediated os is an essential characteristic of plant-associated organisms. in this study, we tested if b. xylophilus-associated bacteria could tolerate prolonged oxidative stress conditions with or without the nematode, in an attempt to understand their behaviour in the oxidative burst conditions of the host tree in the early stages of pwd.

plant-associated bacteria, beneficial or pathogenic, have developed efficient detoxification systems to cope with host-ros  <cit> . this study demonstrates that serratia spp. lcn- <dig> and lcn- <dig>  and pwn- <dig>  associated to b. xylophilus could sustain growth independently, and promote the survival of the nematodes under strong os conditions. this result indicates, again, a beneficial and a potential helper effect to b. xylophilus. vicente et al.  <cit>  reported that some b. xylophilus-associated bacteria displayed plant pathogenic traits potentially related with pwd symptoms and b. xylophilus pathogenicity such as high cellulolytic activity, biofilm formation, eps exudation and siderophores production. in fact, some of these traits are used by environmental bacteria as protectants against os . more recently, chen et al.  <cit>  showed that b. xylophilus-associated bacteria could support the nematode in the degradation of host xenobiotics. based on our results, we suggest that b. xylophilus-associated serratia spp. has evolved an elaborate detoxifying system to express several antioxidant enzymes to cope with h2o2-mediated os.

in this study, we measured the transcript levels of two catalases in b. xylophilus in the presence of h2o <dig>  pwn catalase genes presented a high protein similarity with other nematode catalases, evidencing the conserved nature of this enzyme  <cit> . cap’n’collar  transcription factors are broadly conserved in eukaryotes except for plant and fungi  <cit> . c. elegans cnc transcription factor skn- <dig> regulates cellular differentiation of the pharynx and intestine during early embryogenesis, and also controls expression of many antioxidative and detoxification enzymes such as ctls, gpxs and gsts  <cit> . in c. elegans four pathways  are known to control skn- <dig> activity and the genomic structures of these pathways are fully conserved in b. xylophilus <cit> . bacterial effect was transversal to virulent and avirulent b. xylophilus. relative gene expression of catalase genes in b. xylophilus show that without bacteria, the basal expression of the both non-secreted bxy-ctl- <dig> and secreted bxy-ctl- <dig> genes in the virulent isolate ka <dig>  were higher than the avirulent c14- <dig> by  <dig> -fold, which explains their differential tolerance level to h2o <dig>  further investigation on the detoxifying system of b. xylophilus is imperative. when interacting with serratia spp. pwn- <dig>  both virulent and avirulent b. xylophilus catalase levels decreased to levels comparable to non-stress condition, which is also in agreement with mortality test results .

the correlation between virulence and the ability to cope with oxidative stress has been found in the plant parasitic nematode melodoigyne incognita <cit> . virulent b. xylophilus ka <dig> was more tolerant to h2o <dig> than the avirulent b. xylophilus strain c14- <dig>  hirao et al.  <cit>  reported that the susceptible p. thunbergii reacts to pwn invasion with a strong oxidative burst, which implies that virulent b. xylophilus must possess an efficient antioxidant system to cope with these conditions. shinya et al. <cit>  suggested that potential ros scavengers gst and gapdh are localized on the surface coat of b. xylophilus. li et al.  <cit>  proposed 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin on the nematode cuticle of b. xylophilus, as another antioxidant agent in opposing oxidative burst. recently,  <dig> anti-oxidant proteins were identified in the b. xylophilus secretome after plant extract stimuli, namely peroxiredoxin, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, nucleoredoxin-like protein, sod, and thioredoxin  <cit> . in this context, it is essential to further investigate the possible relation between virulence of b. xylophilus and its tolerance to oxidative stress, which was shown for the first time in this study.

to explore the bacterial interaction with b. xylophilus, we have studied bacteria attachment to the nematode cuticle, an important characteristic that, to our knowledge, has not been reported before. in our experiments, the associated-bacteria were not found to strongly attach to the cuticle of b. xylophilus. after 24 h contact with a high concentration of gfp-tagged serratia spp. lcn- <dig>  only a few bacteria could be detected on pwn cuticle . shinya et al. <cit>  have shown the presence of few bacteria on the nematode cuticle even after vigorous washing by scanning electron microscopy . b. xylophilus associated bacteria are reported to be carried on the nematode’s surface, and in average  <dig> were counted on the cuticle of pwn isolated from diseased trees  <cit> . if bacteria are not attached to the nematode surface, how can they be transported by b. xylophilus from and into a pine tree? a possible explanation could be that these bacteria are transported within the nematode  <cit> . however, the possible point of entry in b. xylophilus, the stylet opening, is very small compared with the bacteria size.

serratia is an environmental ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium, mostly free-living with an opportunistic lifestyle but also a pathogenic agent to plants, insects and humans  <cit> . in the plant context, s. proteamaculans is usually identified as an endophytic bacterium living in poplar trees  <cit> , characterized by colonizing in harmony and even expresses pgp  traits to promote host health. s. marcescens is also reported as a pathogenic agent of curcubit yellow vine disease  <cit> . in both cases, these serratia species are well adapted to the host plant  conditions, either as endophytes or pathogens, and are able to evade or suppress plant defences  <cit> . we could not ascertain a strong attachment of associated-serratia and b. xylophilus. it is not unlike that these bacteria may assist the nematode in an opportunistic or facultative way, and that perhaps these bacteria could be indeed host endophytes. this hypothesis can explain why diverse bacterial communities are associated to b. xylophilus, and why they possess such interesting traits and host-related lifestyle. moreover, it can help to explain the contrasting results obtained in pathogenicity tests conducted previously  <cit> . in this scenario, these multi-species consortia that present some in vitro plant-pathogenic traits that could aid the nematode inside the tree and contribute to pwd development as well  <cit> , they could be asymptomatic endophytes that can become pathogenic as soon as the host tree is weakened  <cit> . nevertheless, the host-colonizing ability of these bacteria requires further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report to show that b. xylophilus-associated serratia species can assist the nematode survival under prolonged os conditions, revealing a possible synergism between both organisms. this beneficial effect of bacteria towards nematode resilience to os has significant influence on pwd development. this disease is presently occurring in a variety of countries/climate zones, and might be influenced by much more various biotic and abiotic factors than previously thought.
