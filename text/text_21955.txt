BACKGROUND
transcriptomics, the parallel quantification of many, or all transcripts of an organism in given conditions, has become a favorite tool for basic research  <cit> . messenger-rna regulation patterns of model organisms under many different conditions have become available during the last years. however, these methods are still not applicable for many industrially important organisms, mainly due to the lack of dna microarrays targeting these organisms. a typical example is the yeast pichia pastoris, which is widely applied for the production of recombinant proteins. several approaches have been taken to derive transcriptomic data without specific microarrays. sauer et al.  <cit>  have applied heterologous hybridization of p. pastoris samples to saccharomyces cerevisiae microarrays. alternative methodological concepts like transcript analysis with the aid of affinity capture   <cit>  may be applied preferentially to subsets of the transcriptome  <cit> , provided that genome sequence data are available. if this is not the case, total cdna may be utilized as a source of probes, either by applying expressed sequence tags to microarrays  <cit>  or employing rna fingerprinting like cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , which has recently been applied to trichoderma reesei  <cit> . these unannotated methods bear of course the disadvantage that specific hits may only be identified after sequencing their respective probes.

therefore oligonucleotide microarrays have become the method of choice for many applications, although their design depends on the availability of a genomic sequence with good gene identification and annotation. the genome sequence of p. pastoris is not published yet. the data available from integrated genomics  contain a partial gene identification and annotation, so that additional effort in this direction was a first step necessary towards development of comprehensive dna microarrays for this yeast species. there is a wide choice of computational gene finders available at the moment which can be classified into intrinsic and extrinsic prediction programs. intrinsic or de novo gene finder only use information from the sequences to be studied, building statistical models to distinguish between coding and non-coding regions of the genome on the basis of biological sequence patterns  <cit> . extrinsic gene finder utilize homology search to determine where protein coding regions are in the genome. their applicability is therefore limited to organisms that have homologs in current databases that are correctly annotated. because of this limitation it is common to integrate homology search with de novo prediction  <cit> . most state of the art gene finders use a form of hidden markov model  differing in the implementation and complexity of the model as well as the ease in which users can adapt the application to their needs  <cit> .

it is well known that cross-hybridization can confound microarray results rendering good probe design an essential requirement for accurate microarray analyses. the specificity of oligonucleotides is determined by the gibbs free energy  of the hybridization reaction between potential binding partners. highly specific probes will bind their target transcript much more strongly than any other transcript. considering that microarray experiments are non-equilibrium measurements, it is desirable that microarray probes exhibit uniform thermodynamic properties, which many probe design tools aim to achieve by demanding a narrow distribution of the probe-target melting temperature tm. ideally, probes should have a uniform binding free energy at the hybridization temperature thyb  <cit> .

previous studies have demonstrated that industrial production strains may behave quite differently to laboratory strains and model organisms  <cit> , which emphasizes the importance of analytical tools for industrially relevant strains and species. as an example, the unfolded protein response , a regulation circuit of high relevance for heterologous protein production in eukaryotic cells  <cit> , has been shown to be differentially regulated in p. pastoris  <cit>  compared to s. cerevisiae  <cit> , which is the typical model species for hemiascomycete yeasts. the development of specific microarrays for p. pastoris was intended to allow a detailed analysis of upr regulation in p. pastoris. as in previous transcriptomics work with s. cerevisiae the induction of upr was either accomplished by addition of dithiothreitol  or tunicamycin, this work aimed at a comparison of dtt induced gene regulation in p. pastoris to that in s. cerevisiae published by travers et al.  <cit> . finally we aimed at the comparison of dtt induced regulation to the regulatory response to overexpression of hac <dig>  the transcription factor controlling the upr. transcriptional regulation of hac <dig> overexpression has not been studied for yeasts so far, so that we expected valuable data to better define the core upr regulated transcriptome.

RESULTS
gene prediction and oligo design
to evaluate available gene finders for their performance on yeast genomes, three de novo gene finders  were tested on the genome sequence of s. cerevisiae. genemark and glimmer <dig> work with a prokaryotic hidden markov model  whereas glimmerhmm employs a eukaryotic gene model. genemark was trained with coding and non-coding sequences of s. cerevisiae, building an hmm transition probability matrix of the 7th order. glimmer <dig> and glimmerhmm could be trained directly on the genome in question without specifying coding and non-coding regions. in lomsadze et al.  <cit>  and besemer and borodovsky  <cit>  the difficulty of eukaryotic gene finders in the prediction of genes for organisms with few introns is discussed and linked to a lack of data for representative exon – intron models. our results confirmed that a gene finder written for eukaryotes  could not be trained well on yeast genomes, introducing far too many introns into the predicted genes. both prokaryotic versions performed much better, with genemark predicting less false negatives but more false positives than glimmer <dig> . even though the positive prediction value was somewhat lower with genemark it was more important not to miss true positives than to achieve a lower rate of false positives. a further improvement could be achieved by a genemark model for lower eukaryotes, in which the prokaryotic algorithm is modified to use kozak start sites instead of prokaryotic ribosomal binding sites. p. pastoris genes were predicted using this version of genemark with the lowest possible threshold  so that filter conditions could be better controlled at a later state. the prediction yielded a total of  <dig>  putative genes for the genome of p. pastoris.

three different gene finders were tested on the genome sequence of s. cerevisiae chromosome  <dig> to evaluate the quality of gene prediction. sensitivity = tp/, positive prediction value = tp/; for glimmer hmm the column false positives contains the number of genes and in brackets the number of exons.

in a wu-blastn search against s. cerevisiae,  <dig>  sequences that were predicted by genemark, and  <dig>  of the ig predictions produced hits with s. cerevisiae using an e value  of < 10- <dig>  a hit length >  <dig> nucleotides and an identity of >50%. to reduce the redundancy within the data set the predicted genes were clustered into groups sharing more than 90% similarity using cd-hit  <cit> . from a total of  <dig>  candidate sequences ,  <dig>  cd-hit groups were obtained. from the cluster file it was clear that some of the clusters had to be analyzed further before selecting target sequences for the oligo design. after the removal of all sequences that had a short length and a low prediction value, complex clusters were defined as clusters for which the minimum relative length of all sequences was smaller than  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  clusters fell into this category and were excluded at a first design stage.

finally  <dig>  predicted target sequences remained to be tested in the first microarray experiments. oligoarray  <dig>   <cit>  was able to design oligonucleotide probes for  <dig>  sequences ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides.

validation arrays for the first list of predicted transcript sequences 
with these probes  <dig> ×  <dig> k slides were produced on the agilent microarray platform and employed for an initial validation of the predicted transcript sequences by hybridization with the pool samples of p. pastoris . one slide had to be discarded because of quality issues. for the remaining  <dig> arrays the number of probes showing a signal varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> . of these,  <dig>  had a signal on all  <dig> arrays, and only  <dig> probes showed no hybridization on all  <dig> arrays.

second, curated list of predicted target sequences and second oligo design
the results of the initial validation arrays were utilized to adapt the list of predicted genes, keeping all predictions for which a hybridization signal could be observed for all arrays plus all predictions with significant sequence similarity to annotated genes as well as all sequences with an average gene prediction score >  <dig> . this approach allows for the fact that not all genes will have been actively expressed in the target samples. additionally, predicted transcripts resulting from a subsequent analysis of the complex clusters were included at this stage. of the  <dig>  complex cluster that were not included in the design for the first batch of arrays, only  <dig> contained more than  <dig> sequences and for a further  <dig> no subsequence match of at least  <dig> nucleotides could be found within the last  <dig> bases at the 3'-end. these  <dig> clusters were manually curated while the rest could be automatically reduced to one sequence. to make full use of the  <dig>  features available on the agilent microarray platform, it was decided to also include predicted sequences with somewhat lower gene prediction score that showed a hybridization signal in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> arrays. finally, a selected set of  <dig>  predicted transcript sequences was used as targets for probe design of a comprehensive p. pastoris microarray. while it is obvious that this list is larger than the expected number of open reading frames , as judged in comparison to other yeast species  <cit> , we intentionally included more putative transcript sequences, as false positives with a distinct sequence will not negatively affect microarray design or experiments, in contrast to the damage of falsely excluding a potential transcript target.

oligonucleotide probes were designed using a probe design tool developed in-house, a thermodynamic model-based oligoset optimizer . thermodo designed probes for  <dig>  sequences, of which only  <dig> were predicted as having cross-hybridization potential. the thermodo design was compared to probe design with earray  <cit> . the distributions of Δg and tm of both designs are shown in additional file  <dig>  clearly the thermodo designed probes are more uniform in respect to the gibbs free energy Δg, indicating a superior hybridization performance  <cit> .

the final probe design was manufactured on  <dig> ×  <dig> k slides by agilent, and evaluated for reproducibility and biological meaningfulness. pool samples were applied to  <dig> arrays on  <dig> slides each, including dye swap. the scatterplots show uniformly high correlations > 97% both within and between arrays, both on same and different slides, indicating high reproducibility of hybridization signals between identical samples. exemplarily, a scatterplot of signal intensities derived from the same samples  is shown in figure  <dig>  for the final gene list the annotation was improved in addition to the annotation provided by ig. this resulted in  <dig> annotated orfs, of which  <dig> had an ig annotation.  <dig> newly annotated orfs were found, and the annotation of  <dig> hypothetical proteins was confirmed. all annotated genes are listed in additional file  <dig> 

biological evaluation of the new microarrays
the performance of the new arrays was examined by a hybridization experiment using samples, for which transcript regulation data have been obtained before  <cit> . the biological question evaluated was the regulatory response of p. pastoris to constitutive overexpression of the active form of s. cerevisiae hac <dig>  the transcription factor controlling upr target genes. by this approach, the regulation of  <dig> genes which have been studied before using trac  <cit>  could be verified, with 80% of these genes showing the same regulation pattern for both methods . this correlation is statistically significant based on calculating the regression .

the similarities and differences of upr induction and reaction to dtt stress have been discussed before  <cit> . to achieve further insight into this technologically relevant issue, we compared the gene regulation patterns of a hac <dig> overexpressing strain vs wildtype control with the regulation pattern of the wildtype treated with dtt for  <dig> min vs the untreated control. genes were qualified as significantly regulated with a p-value <  <dig>  .  <dig>  of all features on the microarrays appeared as differentially regulated either upon dtt treatment or hac <dig> overexpression, or both.  <dig>  reacted to hac <dig>  and  <dig>  to dtt, with an overlap of  <dig> . considering only the  <dig>  annotated genes, a similar pattern is observed with roughly half of the regulated genes overlapping between dtt and hac <dig>  and another half being typical only for either of the treatments . accordingly, the correlation of log fold changes of the two treatments is apparent but rather weak . while dtt treatment is widely accepted as a standard inducer of upr, these observations indicate that the gene regulation pattern triggered by the upr transcription factor hac <dig> differs to a significant extent from that exerted by dtt.

as previous research on transcriptome regulation upon upr induction usually employs a fold change  cut-off to highlight the strongly regulated genes, we decided to introduce fc >  <dig>  as a second criterion to identify more strongly regulated genes for further detailed analysis . although the introduction of a fc cut-off alters the absolute number of regulated genes, it does not alter the relative distribution of regulated genes categorized into functional groups , as can be seen in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

comparison of upr induction by dtt in p. pastoris and s. cerevisiae
in order to compare the effects of dtt treatment in s. cerevisiae with those in p. pastoris, the data published by travers et al.  <cit>  for  <dig> min treatment of s. cerevisiae with dtt were evaluated alongside with our results for p. pastoris. all genes of s. cerevisiae which were listed in  <cit>  and for which homologs in p. pastoris were identified were classified as upregulated, downregulated or unregulated. in order to compare the two data sets, a cutoff of  <dig>  fold differential expression was set in both to define regulated genes. a significance threshold on p-values could not be employed, as these data were not provided for s. cerevisiae. 48% of these genes defined as regulated or unregulated reacted in p. pastoris just as in s. cerevisiae.

a closer evaluation revealed that certain go groups were regulated very similarly in both yeast species, while others showed only a low degree of similarity . fisher's exact test was performed to evaluate the significance of groups with low similarity. especially the go groups 'translocation', 'protein folding', 'protein degradation', and to some extent 'glycosylation' and 'transport' showed high degrees of similarity. in some go groups, only some subgroups reacted similarly while others behaved differently in the two yeasts. of the 'glycosylation' group, core oligosaccharide synthesis and glycosyltransferase genes behaved very similarly, while glycoprotein processing, gpi anchoring and o-glycosylation related genes were regulated significantly different . in the 'protein degradation' group, more similarity was observed for erad genes than for ubiquitin/proteasome related genes. among the 'transport' gene group, budding, fusion and retrieval of er to golgi showed a high degree of similar regulation, contrary to the subgroup distal secretion. low similarities were observed for 'lipid metabolism', 'vacuolar protein sorting' and 'cell wall biogenesis' genes. it becomes obvious that core upr genes related to protein translocation, folding and er transport, as well as core n-glycosylation react similarly to dtt treatment in p. pastoris as compared to s. cerevisiae, while genes involved in processes which are more distal from er protein folding behave more differently, indicating that those processes  differ significantly between the two yeasts.

all genes that were indicated in  <cit>  as core upr genes in s. cerevisiae and having an annotation in p. pastoris were grouped by their go process functions. similar regulation of a gene means upregulated, downregulated or below cut-off, respectively, in both yeasts.

overexpression of hac <dig> triggers a different regulation pattern compared to dtt treatment
in most previous studies of the upr in lower eukaryotic cells, treatment with dtt or tunicamycin, or heterologous protein expression has been employed to trigger the upr. this study clearly indicates that the set of regulatory events triggered by dtt analysis only partially overlaps with the reactions to constitutive expression of the activated form of the upr transcription factor hac <dig> . interestingly, both treatments resulted in the same amount of genes being down-regulated as being up-regulated, a fact that has been neglected to some extent in the existing literature.

those genes appearing beyond the threshold  were subjected to a more detailed comparison between the effects of dtt treatment and hac <dig> induced regulation. the relative numbers of up- and downregulated genes in each go biological process term based on the sgd go slim tool  <cit>  are depicted in figure  <dig> 

a pattern common to both treatments is the down-regulation of major metabolic processes like carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism, as well as that of vitamins, cofactors and aromatic and heterocyclic compounds. this makes it obvious that the upr has a major impact on decreasing both catabolic and anabolic processes. on the other side, both treatments lead to up-regulation of protein folding and vesicular transport. these effects are in line with the published literature, indicating the cellular reaction towards alleviation of the upr  <cit> .

as expected, the genes coding for classical upr targets are induced both in hac <dig> overproducing and in dtt stressed cells, and genes underlined in the following paragraphs have been identified as upr targets in previous studies. especially the er folding catalysts pdi <dig> and ero <dig>  the dnaj homologs jem <dig> and scj <dig>  the er resident chaperones cne <dig> , kar2/bip and lhs <dig> and the mitochondrial chaperones hsp <dig> and ssc <dig> are significantly up-regulated in both conditions. among the functional group of 'protein modification' the majority of up-regulated genes belong to the core oligosaccharide synthesis , oligosaccharyltransferase complex , glycoprotein processing , gpi anchor biosynthesis  and golgi/o-linked glycosylation . besides these, several genes coding for the translocon pore complex , which aid the translocation of nascent polypeptides into the er, are induced. higashio and kohno  <cit>  describe the stimulation of er-to-golgi transport through the upr by inducing copii vesicle formation. in this context, we see sec <dig>  sec <dig>  sfb <dig>  yip <dig>  and erv <dig> upregulated. however, also proteins building the copi coatomer, which are required for retrograde golgi-to-er transport, show increased transcription levels upon er stress in our experiments .

while we cannot give any information on erad regulation, as hrd <dig> is the only annotated gene of this protein degradation process , we observed the down-regulation of some components involved in the assembly of the  <dig> s core of the  <dig> s proteasome  and ubiquitin ubi <dig> upon constitutive upr activation. in this context, shaffer et al.  <cit>  describe reduced degradation of newly synthesized proteins in xbp1-overexpressing human raji cells.

induction of genes encoding cytosolic chaperones  can only be seen in the hac1-overproducing strain. additionally, the er-resident pdi homolog mpd <dig> and two members of the ppiases  are only up-regulated in the engineered strain, but not upon dtt addition.

one of the most striking patterns is the significant up-regulation of a large number of genes with functions in ribosomal biogenesis . most of these genes are contributing to rrna processing  and ribosome subunit nuclear export and assembly, while the ribosomal proteins  themselves are not among the regulated genes for p. pastoris . no genes with a function in mrna decay show increased transcription levels. the induction of the above functional categories came as a surprise, as translational down-regulation of proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis was recently reported when s. cerevisiae cell were treated with dtt  <cit> . in contrast, the transcription levels of  <dig> out of the  <dig> mrnas listed by these authors are enhanced in our study. transcriptional down-regulation of ribosomal proteins during er stress conditions was also revealed when reanalysing the raw data provided by travers et al.  <cit> . however, shaffer et al.  <cit>  describe an increase in total protein synthesis as well as in the number of assembled ribosomes upon the overexpression of the mammalian hac <dig> homolog xbp <dig> in raji cells, but did not observe upregulation of genes related to ribosome biogenesis. a similar effect was observed after xbp <dig> overexpression in cho-k <dig> cells  <cit> . these results may be an indication that the positive effect of overexpression of the upr transcription factor on heterologous protein production  <cit>  results not just from stimulation of folding and secretion of proteins but also their synthesis. the induction of protein folding related genes upon hac <dig> overexpression is in line with the literature on upr effects, while an impact on organelle biosynthesis other than er and golgi has so far only been described for mammalian cells.

the stimulatory effects of xbp <dig> induction on ribosomes and organelle synthesis in mammalian cells like lymphocytes have been attributed to their function as dedicated protein factories. on the other hand the upr in lower eukaryotes should rather serve to alleviate the load of unfolded, aggregation prone protein. it will be of interest in the future to investigate whether hac <dig> stimulates ribosome biogenesis in other yeasts and fungi as well, and whether this leads to increased translation.

in this context, it is worthwhile to mention the induction of two pathways leading to the unusual post-translationally modified amino acid derivatives diphthamide and hypusine which are exclusively found in eukaryotic translation elongation factors  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . as these biosynthetic pathways are rather complex, and outstanding in the otherwise downregulated group of 'amino acid biosynthesis', this induction underlines the increased demand for protein synthesis.

furthermore, we observe that er stress leads to increased transcription of genes coding for the large and small subunits of the mitochondrial ribosomes , mitochondrial translation initiation and elongation factors  and mitochondrial dna polymerase . several essential constituents of the mitochondrial inner membrane presequence translocase  are also up-regulated, indicating increased necessity for protein import into the mitochondria. similarly, xbp <dig> was shown to increase mitochondrial mass and function in two types of mammalian cells  <cit> .

while previous studies analysing upr regulation mainly focus on up-regulated genes  <cit> , more than half of the genes identified in our study to be regulated are strongly down-regulated . as can be seen in figure  <dig>  anabolic processes such as vitamin production, amino acid and aromatic compound biosynthesis, heterocycle metabolic processes, carbohydrate, lipid and cofactor metabolism are among the most prominent repressed classes in both dtt-treated as well as hac1-overproducing cells. the down-regulation of energy consuming biosynthetic pathways emerges as a general picture during er stress conditions. however, it becomes obvious that the response to the folding perturbation agent dtt strongly differs from constitutive upr induction by hac1-overproduction. especially the prominent down-regulation of genes belonging to 'electron transport' and 'cellular respiration' can easily be explained by the strong reducing capacities of dtt. prominent members of the mitochondrial inner membrane electron transport chain such as subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase  and the ubiquinol cytochrome-c reductase complex  are significantly repressed upon dtt treatment. additionally, cytochrome c , cytochrome c <dig>  and cytochrome c heme lyase  are only under dtt-dependent repression . the reducing features of dtt are most probably also the reason for the up-regulation of genes involved in the upkeeping of 'cellular homeostasis' and clearly, addition of dtt is provoking a 'response to a chemical stimulus'.

down-regulated genes appearing in both hac <dig> and dtt in the 'protein modification' group focus on protein kinases  and components of the ubiquitinylation complex  involved in cell cycle regulation driving the cells towards mitotic exit . these effects are even more pronounced in the hac1-strain, where several more histone modifying enzymes as well as cycline-dependent protein kinases and components of the protein kinase c signalling pathway show reduced transcription levels compared to the wild type. unlike reported for the filamentous fungi t. reesei  <cit>  and a. nidulans  <cit> , genes encoding the histones h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> appear to be down-regulated upon secretion stress in p. pastoris.

no clear picture emerges regarding the regulation of 'lipid metabolism': while sterol and ergosterol biosynthesis tend to be inhibited, the production of sphingolipid precursor substances is enhanced. on the other hand, a down-regulation of the major cell wall constituents  and genes coding for proteins required for the transport of cell wall components to the cell surface  is manifest. taken together, these results indicate a significant remodelling process regarding the p. pastoris cell envelope during er stress conditions.

interestingly, the major groups of metabolic genes were down-regulated upon hac <dig> overexpression, indicating a decrease of the supply of metabolites. however, it should be noted that no reduction of the specific growth rate was observed as compared to the wild type strain . a reduction of metabolic processes, and amino acid synthesis in particular, is contradictory to translation stimulation. further research will be needed to elucidate the overall regulatory pattern of upr in respect to protein synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
additional gene finding and annotation added to the available data for p. pastoris lead to a list of approximately  <dig>  genes with a putative identification of their function, and  <dig>  more potential open reading frames. an oligonucleotide probe set was designed, the hybridization results were evaluated for reproducibility, and results from a biologically relevant analysis were tested for meaningfulness. in a direct comparison to s. cerevisiae employing dtt treatment for upr induction,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes reacted similarly. the differences thus observed between p. pastoris and s. cerevisiae underline the importance of dna microarrays for industrial production strains. hac <dig> overexpression in p. pastoris obviously leads to induction of many genes involved in translation: most genes of ribosome biogenesis, as well as many related to rna metabolism and translation were up-regulated, an effect that has never been observed in yeasts and filamentous fungi so far.

the upregulation of ribosomal biogenesis, rna metabolism, translation, and organelle biosynthesis is specific for hac <dig> overexpression and not observed with dtt treatment, while the latter leads specifically to the upregulation of genes related to chemical stimulus, and the downregulation in the groups electron transport and respiration, so that these reactions have to be regarded as specific for the treatment with a reducing agent rather than upr regulated.
