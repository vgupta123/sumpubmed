BACKGROUND
neisseria meningitidis, or the meningococcus , exclusively colonizes the oro- and nasopharynx of humans. it resides as a commensal in approximately 10% of healthy individuals  <cit> , but may become virulent, disseminating into the bloodstream and crossing the blood-brain barrier  <cit> . mc septicaemia and meningitis are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide  <cit> .

on the mucosal surface of the upper respiratory tract, mc is exposed to reactive oxygen species  produced by the immune system through the oxidative burst and by endogenous aerobic metabolism, causing damage to many cellular components, including dna  <cit> . oxidative dna lesions comprise single- and double strand breaks, abasic  sites, and base damages, among which one of the most common is the oxidation product of guanine,  <dig> -dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine . the mutagenic 8oxog can mispair with adenine during replication and cause g:c → t:a transversions  <cit> .  <dig> -diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine  is another oxidative modified form of guanine that inhibits dna synthesis  <cit> .

the base excision dna repair pathway  is the main defense against the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of endogenously damaged bases. this enzymatic pathway has been identified in all organisms studied to date  <cit> . a dna glycosylase initiates this pathway by cleaving the glycosylic bond between its specific base substrate and the sugar-phosphate backbone, leaving an abasic  site  <cit> . many dna glycosylases also have an inherent ap lyase activity that cleaves the sugar-phosphate backbone at the ap site, which is subsequently repaired by further ber enzymes. in e. coli, formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase  shows substrate specificity for 8oxog and fapy lesions, and exhibits ap lyase activity, in successive β- and δ-elimination steps, leaving a single strand break  <cit> .

in e. coli, the mutagenic effects of oxidated guanines are prevented by a triplet of enzymes termed the go system  <cit> . in go, fpg acts together with the dna glycosylase muty which removes adenine when mispaired with 8oxog, and mutt, a nucleotide hydrolase that converts 8oxogtp to 8oxogmp, preventing incorporation of oxidized gtps into the genomic dna. mc single fpg mutants only elicit a weak mutator phenotype  <cit> , however, mutyfpg double mutants exhibit a much higher increase in spontaneous mutation frequency than would be expected if fpg and muty were involved in unrelated repair mechanisms  <cit> . this synergistic effect of the two mc dna glycosylases confirms their essential role in the repair of oxidative dna damage and a relationship similar to that in the e. coli go system. in vivo mc fpg activity has previously been detected in whole cell extracts of clinical isolates by cleavage of 8oxog opposite c  <cit> , however, the mc fpg substrate specificity has not previously been investigated.

in this study, the mc fpg gene was cloned and its gene product over-expressed and purified to homogeneity. recombinant mc fpg was assessed with regard to its enzymatic activity towards recognized fpg dna substrates. the mc mc <dig> fpg dna sequence  <cit> , flanking regions and predicted amino acid sequence was analyzed. furthermore, sequences of fpg homologues and flanking regions in other neisserial species were aligned and examined. finally, an mc fpg mutant was assessed with regard to phase variation rate and compared to that of the wildtype strain and mismatch repair defective mutants. in essence, the mc fpg predicted structure and the activity pattern detected were similar to those of prototype fpg orthologues in other species.

bioinformatics analyses and search for signature motifs
an in silico search for functional domains and dna binding motifs was carried out on the deduced amino acid sequence of mc mc <dig> fpg , using the the expasy site http://us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protscale.pl and the prosite  <cit>  and pfam databases  <cit> . the electrostatic charge was calculated using the emboss package http://emboss.sourceforge.net/. the dna sequences of the fpg genes and flanking regions as well as the deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and compared in a panel of neisserial species for which the genome sequences were available. the following genome sequences  were downloaded from genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/: neisseria gonorrhoeae fa <dig> , mc mc <dig> serogroup b   <cit> , mc z <dig> serogroup a   <cit> , mc fam <dig> serogroup c   <cit>  and mc  <dig> serogroup c   <cit> . the temporary sequence data for neisseria lactamica st- <dig> was obtained from the pathogen sequencing unit at the sanger institute ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/nl/. access to the genome sequence of mc  <dig> serogroup c was provided by eduardo rocha, abi/institut pasteur, paris, france, with kind permission from vladimir pelicic, necker hospital, paris/imperial college london. prediction of the fpg secondary structure was performed based on a blast search http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi in the jpred program  <cit> . protein data bank  structural modeling was performed using smart http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/, pfam http://www.sanger.ac.uk/software/pfam/, phyre http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre/ and pymol http://www.pymol.org.

the mc fpg flanking regions were searched for the presence of transcriptional terminators with the gester genome scanner for terminators  before lysis by sonication. the cleared lysate was loaded onto a ni-nta agarose column  and the column washed with wash buffer containing  <dig> mm imidazole. bound protein was eluted with a step gradient of  <dig> column volumes of the elution buffer containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm imidazole. fractions containing purified protein were pooled and dialysed against  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl and 10% glycerol.

assay for base excision of 8oxog opposite c, a, g or t
duplex dna substrates containing a single 8oxog opposite of c, a, g or t were generated by 32p 5' end-labelling of oligonucleotides, using t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  followed by annealing to a complementary oligonucleotide  <cit> . the oligonucleotide sequences of the dna substrates are listed in table  <dig>  dna glycosylase reactions were performed by mixing purified protein with 10– <dig> fmol dna substrate in a total volume of  <dig> μl. the enzyme activities were assayed in the reaction buffer previously described  <cit>  and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. e. coli fpg  was included as a positive control. products of the reactions were separated by 20% denaturing page and visualized by phosphorimaging. the assay was performed in triplicate.

assay for formamidopyrimidine  dna glycosylase activity
n--n-methyl-n'-nitrosourea  was used to prepare poly dna   <cit> . dna glycosylase activity was assayed by mixing purified protein with substrate in a reaction buffer containing  <dig> mm 3- propane sulfonic acid, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm dithiothreitol  and 5% glycerol for  <dig> min at 37°c. removal of bases was measured in a total reaction volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> μg of dna substrate and  <dig> ng of purified meningococcal protein or  <dig> u of e. coli fpg . the assay was repeated  <dig> times.

screening for phase variation by use of a universal rate of switching  cassette
to promote efficient natural transformation, a 12-mer dna uptake sequence was inserted into plasmid parr <dig> containing a universal rate of switching  cassette   <cit> , creating plasmid pud. mc strain z <dig>  was transformed with pud and named nmz1099_uros. the muts and fpg genes of nmz1099_uros were inactivated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette as described by davidsen et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  in two separate genetic transformations creating strains nmz1099_urosΔmuts and nmz1099_urosΔfpg. the mononucleotide tract of  <dig> g residues preceding the spectinomycin resistance gene of the uros cassette was confirmed as an intact 8-mer by pcr and sequencing  in all three strains before switching frequency/phase variation was assessed. briefly, mc strains were grown overnight at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  before  <dig> colonies were resuspended in gc broth. serial dilutions were plated on gc agar with and without spectinomycin  and incubated overnight. the spectinomycin off to on switching rate was determined by dividing the number of colonies on gc plates containing spectinomycin by the number of colonies on plain gc plates. phase variation experiments were repeated at least  <dig> times for each strain. significance in differences in phase variation frequency was calculated by the kruskal-wallis test.

RESULTS
fpg is nearly ubiquitous among bacterial species and is highly conserved both within annotated neisserial genome sequences and clinical mc isolates  <cit> , as well as between evolutionarily distant prokaryotes. we examined the activity and specificity of recombinant mc fpg purified to homogeneity towards representative substrates resulting from oxidative dna damage, 8oxog and fapy, and detected prototype fpg glycosylase activity. previously, we have shown a synergistic effect between the two go components muty and fpg in mc  <cit> . together, these findings emphasize a distinct role for fpg in the defense against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species.

the putative mc fpg open reading frame  consists of  <dig> bp and contains a dna uptake sequence   . the mc genome harbours approximately  <dig> copies of this highly conserved  <dig> bp sequence, which is required for efficient transformation  <cit> . a 12-mer dus with two additional bp upstream of the core  <dig> bp repeat element improves the transformation efficiency  <cit> . the mc fpg gene contains one 11-mer. a single complete dus or at-dus  may promote the reacquisition of a gene by transformation if it is damaged or deleted and dus occurs at higher densities in genome maintenance genes than in other house-keeping genes  <cit> .

the organization of the fpg flanking region is unique for neisseria species http://string.embl.de/ . upstream of the fpg gene are the hypothetical orfs nmb <dig> and nmb <dig> . nmb <dig> is annotated as an ortholog to mltd http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cog/, which encodes a membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase of unknown function. nmb <dig> shows 30–40% amino acid identity with dna methyltransferases in a number of bacterial species http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi. downstream, fpg is flanked by the nlaa gene, encoding a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase involved in biosynthesis of the glycerophosholipid membrane  <cit> , about  <dig> bp of non-coding sequence containing two dus within a predicted terminator, and the opposite oriented hypothetical orf nmb <dig>  the nmb <dig>  fpg and nlaa genes are all oriented in the same direction and a putative promoter is found upstream of nmb <dig> while none are identified between these genes. at the end of nmb <dig> a terminator is predicted by transtermhp. between fpg and nlaa, a terminator is predicted by gester. this intrinsic terminator contains a dus and an imperfect dus as inverted repeat, a structure found in many putative mc transcription terminators or attenuators  <cit> . the vimss operon prediction suggests co-transcription of fpg and nmb <dig>  however, swartley and stephens have evidence by reverse transcriptase pcr that nlaa and fpg are co-transcribed in mc strain nmb  <cit> . in microarray analysis of an mc <dig> fpg mutant compared to wildtype, nlaa was the only gene significantly down-regulated at least  <dig>  fold, supporting the evidence for co-transcription of these two genes .

the mc fpg open reading frame encodes  <dig> amino acids containing a predicted n-terminal glycosylase catalytic domain, a helix-two-turn-helix and a c-terminal zinc finger . these regions contain long sequences with a positive electrostatic charge, enforcing binding to negatively charged dna . alignment of the deduced fpg sequence from the genomes of five mc strains reveals non-synonymous or synonymous substitutions in  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acid positions . the positions showing variation correspond exactly to those found in the fpg gene from  <dig> mc clinical isolates previously sequenced  <cit> . an additional  <dig> amino acids show non-synonymous or synonymous variation when the n. gonorrhoeae and n. lactamica sequences are included in the comparison. all known functional residues exhibit complete sequence conservation . comparison of the neisserial fpg sequences to those in species where the fpg crystal structure is solved  <cit>  also shows a high degree of conservation, especially in the functional domains and catalytic amino acid residues . this conservation was confirmed by in silico fusion of the crystal structure of lactococcus lactis fpg with mc fpg using the pdb . interestingly, the 11-mer dus sequence encodes amino acids that are not identified as functional residues and is localized in an fpg region showing relatively low sequence homology across species boundaries .

fpg has been extensively studied in e. coli and is characterized in several other prokaryotes as well  <cit> , displaying identical substrate specificities. in order to analyze the substrate specificity of mc fpg, the gene was over-expressed in e. coli and recombinant mc fpg protein purified to homogeneity . mc fpg has an apparent size in sds-page of approximately  <dig> kda, corresponding to the molecular weight predicted from the genome deduced amino acid sequence and similar to fpg of e. coli and l. lactis  <cit> . the preferred substrates for recognized fpg proteins are 8oxog and fapy residues. the ability of recombinant mc fpg to remove these lesions was investigated, using e. coli fpg as a positive control. activity towards c:fapy residues in a 3h-labeled poly substrate was identified . when assessing the 8oxog excision, the mc fpg displayed both dna glycosylase and ap lyase activity . equivalent levels of base excision of 8oxog opposite c, t and g and much lower activity toward 8oxog when mispaired with a was demonstrated . no activity was dectected in the absence of 8oxog residues . this discrimination of the base opposite the lesion is in keeping with findings on e. coli fpg  <cit> , although the remaining activity against 8oxog:a seen in mc fpg was not found in the original characterization of substrate specificity in e. coli. 8oxog:c is probably the most important physiological substrate for mc fpg, despite the similar levels of nicking observed in 8oxog:t and 8oxog:g, as the former is by far the most common substrate in vivo in e. coli  <cit> . the removal of 8oxog from the genome prevents g:c→t:a transversions in e. coli, but the mutation rates in single fpg mutants are too low in mc to detect these lesions  <cit> , despite this being the most likely event when 8oxog is preferentially mis-incorporated with adenine and left unrepaired. recent studies in m. smegmatis have identified an alternative pattern of preferential incorporation of guanine opposite 8oxog, creating g:c→c:g transversions or a:t→c:g transitions in the absence of fpg  <cit> . 8oxog:g and g:c→c:g transversions can also be found in e. coli and s. pombe, however, they are rare compared to 8oxog:a events. in conclusion, these results demonstrate that the protein encoded by the mc fpg gene excises base lesions that are typical substrates of other fpg orthologues and are consistent with this protein being an fpg dna glycosylase.

mc is a bacterium that seemingly spontaneously produces a plethora of variants upon which selection can act, instead of sensing the environment and changing accordingly  <cit> . one of the major processes governing genetic changes in neisseria sp. is phase variation. phase variation is mediated by unstable polynucleotide tracts allowing the gene expression to be switched on or off  <cit> . recently, several genome maintenance genes have been shown to modulate phase variation frequencies, including the mismatch repair components muts and mutl, the nucleotide excision repair gene uvrd and the translesion dna polymerase dinb  <cit> . since mc fpg is able to remove oxidized guanines, although in an error-free manner, we wanted to investigate a potential contribution of mc fpg on phase variation of polyg tracts. mc strains nmz1099_uros , nmz1099_urosΔfpg  and nmz1099_urosΔmuts  were constructed and examined by s <dig> ribosomal gene switching in a spectinomycin-selection assay . phase variation was, as previously reported  <cit> , significantly increased in the Δmuts  background compared to the wild-type level . however, the mc fpg mutant exhibited only moderate increase  compared to the wild-type level , and thus muts exerts a more profound effect on the stability of mc polyg tracts than fpg. likewise, the mc fpg mutant was recently shown to generate only a weak mutator phenotype when assessed for its spontaneous mutation frequency in a rifampicin assay  <cit> . in conclusion, fpg is not a major player in modulating mc mutation frequencies.

although mc fpg displays traits characteristic of the fpg family of proteins, survival rates of a mc fpg mutant were not affected by exposure to reactive oxygen species  <cit> . this is in contrast to findings in m. smegmatis, where h2o <dig> exposure proved to be lethal to fpg null mutants  <cit> , and in the photosynthetic cyanobacteria s. elongates where an fpg-deficient strain exhibited progressively reduced survival with increasing levels of oxidatively damaging irradiation  <cit> . considering the potential importance of oxidative dna damage in the mc habitat combined with the vulnerability of a relatively g+c rich genome obtaining such lesions, the explanation for the species discrepancy should be investigated further. the fpg family of dna glycosylases also contains endonuclease viii  and eukaryotic nei orthologues. the nei proteins excise oxidized pyrimidines and may also serve as a backup for removal of 8oxog in e. coli  <cit> , however, no mc nei ortholog has been identified  <cit> . on the other hand, the abundant mc anti-oxidant system provides particularly high protection towards the generation of such dna lesions  <cit> . in general, the elucidation of the mc dna repair profile is important for understanding the lifestyle of this important pathogen, commensal and model organism.

CONCLUSIONS
mc fpg contains dus both within its coding sequence and in close proximity to the open reading frame, potentially promoting reacquisition of this gene by transformation if it is damaged or lost. the fpg gene may belong to an operon together with a putative dna methyltransferase and a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, although the reasons for this gene organisation remain obscure. both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of neisserial fpg homologues are highly conserved. in addition, mc fpg amino acid sequence shows great conservation across species boundaries in functional domains, and mc fpg contains a predicted n-terminal glycosylase catalytic domain, a helix-two-turn-helix and a c-terminal zinc finger. accordingly, mc fpg exhibits dna glycosylase and ap lyase activities and remove both 8oxog and fapy lesions. when examining the stability of polyg tracts, muts was found to modulate mutation frequencies due to phase variation to a much higher extent than fpg. in conclusion, mc fpg predicted structure and activity pattern were found to be similar to those of prototype fpg orthologues in other species. together, these findings emphasize a distinct role for mc fpg in the defense against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species.
