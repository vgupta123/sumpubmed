BACKGROUND
plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly human malaria parasite, notorious for its immense disease burden, ability to persist in individuals for months if not longer, and rapid development of resistance to all currently available treatments . the symptomatic characteristics of acute p. falciparum malaria infection correspond to cycles of red blood cell  rupture, as merozoite parasites invade rbcs, asexually replicate into 8– <dig> new daughter merozoites, egress from the rbcs, and repeat the process every 48 h . this process can be readily modeled in the lab, in contrast to the sexual stage required for transmission, which takes 8– <dig> days in human rbcs and then an additional 8– <dig> days in mosquitoes  <cit> . due to the clinical symptoms associated with the asexual blood stage and the relative ease of obtaining samples, the vast majority of current anti-malarial compounds and research programs target this stage of the parasite life cycle  <cit> . however, the idea of targeting both the symptomatic and transmissible parasite form is garnering increased public attention, making research on sexual stage commitment and sexual development a priority as well .

the first p. falciparum genome sequence was published in  <dig>  <cit> . our understanding of malaria biology has advanced considerably since this milestone, largely due to genome-wide studies  <cit> . early transcriptome studies found that key p. falciparum protein-coding genes are typically transcribed only once per blood stage, ‘just-in-time’ for translation and function  <cit> . subsequently, global ribosome profiling and proteome studies revealed significant post-transcriptional regulation and a unique histone code involving at least  <dig> histone post-translational modifications and four novel histone variants . additionally, paired transcriptome-epigenome studies found dynamic chromatin remodeling and clonally variant gene expression  patterns during blood stage development . independent studies have confirmed a heritable epigenetic layer to monoallelic expression of the 60-member p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein  <dig> -encoding var gene family, as well as heritable epigenetic regulation of genes involved in invasion and nutrient uptake .

while it has become increasingly clear over the past decade that the p. falciparum genome is tightly regulated, the regulatory elements themselves are still largely uncharacterized  <cit> . for example, it is not mechanistically clear how the parasite transcriptionally silences, activates, or switches pfemp1-encoding var genes to evade the human immune system, or how the parasite switches from asexual to sexual development  <cit> . few sequence-specific transcription factors have been identified, and p. falciparum does not encode identifiable micrornas, microrna processing machinery, or rna-induced silencing complex  components . with the absence of many known transcription factors and the canonical rna interference pathway, master regulatory elements orchestrating immune escape, invasion, transmission, and other critical parasite processes remain to be discovered.

we hypothesized that further study of p. falciparum long non-coding rna  may provide missing insights into p. falciparum transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and chromatin state control. encouragingly, previous survey studies have demonstrated non-coding transcription in p. falciparum , and a growing body of evidence supports the crucial regulatory roles of lncrnas in humans and model organisms  <cit> . for example, it has been shown that lncrnas coordinate x chromosome inactivation in female mammalian cells, flowering time in plants, and gametogenesis in budding yeast . a handful of circrnas have been recently shown to function as microrna sponges as well  <cit> . while prior work has suggested the transcription of intergenic, antisense, and even circular rna  in p. falciparum, lncrna transcript models have not been defined and transcript properties have not been generalized on a broad scale .

in this study, we assemble  <dig> intergenic lncrna and  <dig> antisense transcript structures from strand-specific p. falciparum rna sequencing reads , compile a comprehensive catalog of transcript properties, summarize global trends, and experimentally validate the splicing structure of three p. falciparum lncrnas with exceptional properties. we also predict the transcription of hundreds of novel p. falciparum circrna candidates , and search for human microrna binding sites across p. falciparum coding sequences. to our knowledge, the latter analysis has not been reported previously, nor has a role for human microrna binding interactions within p. falciparum transcripts. on the other hand, lamonte et al. and others have shown that human micrornas do indeed translocate from the red blood cell into p. falciparum  <cit> .

although many studies, including our own, have provided insights into the p. falciparum non-coding transcriptome, an in depth strand-specific catalog was critically needed to accelerate hypothesis generation and experimental testing . as an example of the novel insights that this work provides, we have identified that lncrna and mrna expression dynamics differ during parasite invasion, have found evidence that antisense-sense transcriptional interference is prevalent during the blood stage, and have contributed the initial characterization and structural validation of a highly expressed, non-coding counterpart to p. falciparum gametocyte development  <dig> .

RESULTS
strand-specific rna sequencing of biological replicate blood stage time courses
to investigate p. falciparum lncrna transcription, we harvested fifteen blood stage samples from two biological replicate time courses . the first time course comprised eleven samples harvested over 56 h from a tightly synchronized p. falciparum 3d <dig> parasite population:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 56 h post-infection . as the asexual blood stage is an approximately 48-hour cycle, this sample set allowed us to profile gene expression during the critical process of rbc rupture and parasite invasion. the second time course comprised four samples harvested in synchronous p. falciparum 3d <dig> parasites approximately four hours before and after the ring to trophozoite and trophozoite to schizont morphological stage transitions, which occur during the blood stage at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, respectively.fig.  <dig> overview of p. falciparum rna sequencing sample set, computational pipeline, and read alignment metrics.  we harvested total rna from two independent p. falciparum blood stage time courses, including a 56-hour time course consisting of eleven samples. we combined samples harvested  <dig> and  <dig> hpi at equal ratios . similarly, we combined samples harvested  <dig> and  <dig> hpi at equal ratios . we harvested four additional samples from a second time course approximately 4 h before and after gross stage transitions. thus these samples correspond to the late ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, and early schizont stages, respectively. in total, we sequenced fifteen strand-specific rna sequencing  libraries on an illumina hiseq  <dig> machine. illumina sequencing yielded approximately  <dig> million 101-bp paired-end reads. we analyzed reads using the tuxedo suite  and according to the circbase circrna discovery pipeline  <cit> . using this approach, we identified  <dig> intergenic lncrna ,  <dig> antisense rna , and  <dig> circrna candidates. additionally,  <dig> genes,  <dig> transcripts, and  <dig> promoters reached statistical significance in terms of differential expression, alternative splicing, and alternative promoter usage, respectively. / normalized read alignment tracks across a pfemp1-encoding var gene  and the clag <dig>  gene  indicated that these challenging loci could generally be  mapped. annotated gene models are shown in dark green and dark blue. reads from each 56-hour time course sample mapping to the  strand are shown below each horizontal axis in light green, while reads mapping to the  strand are shown above each horizontal axis in light blue. uniqueness of 100mers is plotted in red as a mappability track, where the baseline represents a score of one, or uniquely mapping. / plotting the expression during the 56-hour time course of the dominant pfemp1-encoding var gene  and both the clag <dig>   and clag <dig>   genes showed, respectively, that var gene expression peaked during the ring stage, whereas clag <dig>  and clag <dig>  expression peaked during the schizont stage. moreover, as clag <dig> genes are mutually exclusively expressed  <cit> , we found that that the bulk of our parasites transcribed only the clag <dig>  gene. expression is plotted in units of log <dig>   the percent of reads in each library mapping to annotated transcripts in the proper orientation  ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. the average calculated from both reads is reported



given the high at content and dense genic structure of the p. falciparum genome, we then extensively optimized rna sequencing procedures, both experimental and computational, in order to derive a high-quality p. falciparum transcriptome. in terms of experimental optimization, we tested numerous variables and pursued technical developments shown to reduce sequence-based bias in dna sequencing libraries and to improve strand-specificity in rna sequencing libraries . subsequently, we established a library preparation protocol that uses multiple dnase treatments to remove genomic dna, ribo-zero beads to remove ribosomal rna, the dutp method with actinomycin d to preserve strand specificity, and the kapa hifi polymerase to amplify libraries in real-time for the minimum number of cycles necessary .

after harvesting samples from the two time courses and developing and validating our strand-specific library preparation protocol, we prepared libraries from the fifteen blood stage samples in parallel, and sequenced libraries on two lanes of an illumina hiseq  <dig> machine. illumina sequencing yielded  <dig> million  <dig> base-pair  paired-end reads in total, with sequencing depth ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million  alignable reads per sample. we noted high base quality scores and no significant adapter contamination .

aligning and benchmarking sequences
we took a conservative approach to read alignment, requiring read pairs to map perfectly and uniquely to the p. falciparum 3d <dig> reference genome. in support of this, we determined that  <dig>  % of all possible 100mers in the p. falciparum genome are unique. in addition, we tested our ability to map read pairs across repeated gene families, such as the pfemp1-encoding var gene family and the two cytoadherence-linked asexual gene  <dig>  loci, which we calculated share  <dig>  % sequence similarity. specifically, we visualized a lower bound to mappability across these repeated loci by plotting the uniqueness of 100mers as a mappability track. fig. 1b and c show the mappability track  compared to strand-specific read coverage across a pfemp1-encoding var gene  and the clag <dig>  gene , respectively. fig. 1c and d plot the expression profiles of these genes, as well as the clag <dig>  gene . using this stringent approach and paired-end information, we were able to uniquely map read pairs to these repeated loci, including through short stretches of non-unique sequence.

after conservatively aligning reads using tophat  <cit> , we assessed data quality following the rna sequencing benchmarking metrics put forth by deluca et al. and wang et al.  <cit> . we calculated the strand-specificity, coefficient of variation, duplication rate, gap rate, ribosomal rna rate, exonic rate, insert size, and gc content of each aligned set of reads . importantly, we found that greater than  <dig>  % of reads mapped to the reference strand in the expected orientation in each sample . this result was on par with yeast strand-specific sequencing libraries, and confirmed that our data was highly strand-specific  <cit> . we also found an average coefficient of variation  of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  across the top  <dig> expressed genes  in each sample . these cv values were lower than the lowest cv value reported in the benchmarking study referenced above , indicating more even read coverage in our samples  <cit> . taken together, the rigorous examination of our data quality demonstrated that it was comparable to the state-of-the-art in model organisms.

benchmarking time courses
comparing samples between two independent time courses is a known challenge in the field, and can be confounded by experimental factors such as culture conditions  <cit> . we thus developed a computational solution that leverages multidimensional scaling  to assess stage similarities on a transcriptome-wide scale. while mds has not previously been used for p. falciparum sample comparisons, its utility has been demonstrated in humans and in model organisms such as yeast, especially when periodicity is expected  <cit> . mds analysis using sample profiles from both time courses revealed the cyclical nature of the p. falciparum blood stage, with samples progressing in time around an approximately 48-hour clock . this analysis also confirmed that the four morphology-based samples corresponded to the 56-hour, high-resolution time course samples at expected intervals.fig.  <dig> multidimensional scaling and gene ontology confirm expected p. falciparum blood stage expression patterns. the mds plot of sample profiles embedded samples around a circle. traversing the circle, we found that samples progressed through the approximately 48-hour p. falciparum blood stage according to their time and morphology labels as expected. the 56-hour time course samples are labeled in red, green, and blue, with red corresponding to samples harvested within the predicted ring stage, green corresponding to samples harvested within the predicted trophozoite stage, and blue corresponding to samples harvested within the predicted schizont stage. the morphology-based labels correspond to the late ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, and early schizont stages, respectively



as a complementary analysis, we classified  <dig> ring-specific,  <dig> trophozoite-specific, and  <dig> schizont-specific genes according to their maximal expression time-point. we then computed go term enrichment on these stage-specific gene sets  <cit> . ring-, trophozoite-, and schizont-specific go terms were specific to host cell adhesion processes, metabolic processes, and protein catabolic processes, respectively, with dna replication spanning both trophozoite- and schizont-specific go terms . these go terms were highly consistent with our current understanding of p. falciparum biology. taken together, mds paired with global go term enrichment analysis validated the biological integrity of our time course samples.

transcript assembly
we next set out to assemble p. falciparum transcript structures, with or without the assistance of annotated transcript models, and to assess assembly performance using either cufflinks or genome-guided trinity  . specifically, we were looking for high contiguity , low chimerism , and for the final assembly to be manageable and high-confidence  <cit> . importantly, our calculations conservatively assumed that all of the chimeric predictions represent assembly artifacts. however, it is worth noting that some portion may represent bona fide products of the spliceosome machinery .

based on its performance features, we chose to further explore the high-confidence cufflinks transcripts . however, it may be possible to filter the genome-guided trinity results based on read support or expression level to yield a more manageable p. falciparum transcriptome assembly . using cufflinks without the assistance of annotation, we found that  <dig>  % of annotated transcripts had assembled transcripts contiguously spanning them, while only  <dig>  % of assembled transcripts were chimeric . with the assistance of annotation, the chimerism rate dropped to  <dig>  % and the contiguity rate naturally rose to 100 % . for reference, lu et al. reported a chimerism rate of 6 %, 14 %, and 22 % in human, mouse, and yeast cufflinks assemblies, respectively  <cit> . we thus considered the proportion of chimeric transcripts in our cufflinks assemblies to be acceptably low.table  <dig> comparative assessment of p. falciparum transcriptome assembly highlights the performance of cufflinks rabt


plasmodbv <dig> 
we compared the contiguity, chimerism, and feature counts of cufflinks versus genome-guided trinity transcriptome assembly, with or without the assistance of annotation. cufflinks incorporating reference annotation based transcriptome assembly  provided the optimal p. falciparum transcriptome.

contiguity is the rate of annotated transcripts covered by one assembled transcript over at least 90 % of the annotated transcript exonic length in the correct orientation. chimerism is the rate of assembled transcripts that span more than one annotated transcript in the correct orientation. total number of transcripts, number of intergenic transcripts, and number of antisense transcripts correspond to the total number of assembled transcripts, the number of assembled transcripts predicted between plasmodbv <dig>  annotations, and the number of assembled transcripts predicted antisense to plasmodbv <dig>  annotations. in total,  <dig>  transcripts are annotated in plasmodbv <dig> 


*rabt = reference annotation based transcript assembly



to further benchmark cufflinks assembly performance in p. falciparum, we compared the expression properties, gc content, and length of cufflinks-assembled transcripts to those of previous annotations. towards this end, we paired  <dig> and  <dig> assembled transcripts with plasmodbv <dig>  annotated transcripts in the unassisted and assisted cufflinks assemblies, respectively. we then calculated the correlation between paired expression profiles, finding a median correlation of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for unassisted and assisted transcripts, respectively. this led us to conclude that analyzing assembled transcript expression profiles was essentially interchangeable with analyzing annotated transcript expression profiles. we did, however, note a shift towards lower fpkm  expression level and lower gc content for assembled transcripts. this was largely because assembled transcripts included unannotated, likely untranslated regions  with reduced read support and gc content as compared to coding regions . we selected the annotation-assisted cufflinks transcriptome for further analyses, unless otherwise noted, as it represented the most complete p. falciparum transcriptome.

in sum, annotation-assisted cufflinks assembly predicted  <dig> transcripts, including  <dig> unannotated intergenic transcripts  and  <dig> antisense transcripts  . the  <dig> antisense loci overlapped  <dig> annotated genes in an approximately 1: <dig> ratio. this encompassed transcription of at least 73 % of the p. falciparum genome, a 13 % increase compared to annotation alone, and included the prediction of high-confidence antisense transcription from 8 % of annotated genes. annotation-assisted cufflinks assembly also predicted  <dig> novel splice-junctions . on the other hand, cufflinks assembly without annotation rediscovered  <dig> out of  <dig> annotated splice-junctions  and, as noted above, predicted contiguous transcripts spanning  <dig> out of  <dig> annotated transcripts  .fig.  <dig> characterization of  <dig> unannotated p. falciparum lncrnas reveals global trends as well as intriguing outliers.  without annotation assistance, at least  <dig> out of  <dig>  annotated transcripts could be contiguously assembled in our blood stage samples.  <dig> annotated transcripts could not be contiguously assembled, and we excluded  <dig> short and/or structural rnas from assembly. given this high reassembly rate of known transcripts, it is possible that the  <dig> intergenic lncrnas and  <dig> antisense rnas described here represent the majority of lncrnas transcribed in p. falciparum.  comparative inspection of non-clustering heatmaps showed that predicted lncrnas were developmentally regulated in a similar periodic fashion to annotated mrnas. however, it was also apparent that a subset of lncrnas strongly peaked in expression during parasite invasion, and that there was a paucity of antisense transcript levels during parasite invasion. the  <dig> hpi invasion time-point is indicated with purple arrows. transcripts are ordered by their angular position in the mds plot of transcript expression profiles, and samples are ordered by time. mean-centered expression is in units of log <dig>   the distribution of maximum expression levels for each transcript class suggested that both intergenic lncrnas  and antisense rnas  were robustly expressed, albeit they typically reached lower maximum expression levels than annotated mrnas .  pearson correlation during the 56-hour time course between  <dig>  random mrna gene pairs  as compared to  <dig> mrna-neighboring gene pairs ,  <dig> intergenic lncrna-neighboring gene pairs , and  <dig> antisense-sense gene pairs . to be consistent, we defined the neighboring gene used in both the mrna and intergenic lncrna pairings as the more correlated neighboring mrna.  the distribution of gc content for each transcript class indicated that intergenic lncrnas  and antisense rnas  typically had lower gc content than annotated transcripts , though a handful of intergenic lncrnas had unusually high gc content .  the distribution of transcript length for each transcript class showed that intergenic lncrnas  and antisense rnas  were comparable in length to annotated transcripts , with the average of each class being longer than 1 kb. markedly long intergenic lncrnas  are indicated with a purple arrow.  plotting the normalized distribution of antisense rnas relative to annotated gene bodies revealed a 3’ tail-to-tail bias



coding region identification
to determine the coding potential of the  <dig> previously unannotated transcripts, we used transdecoder and found that at least  <dig>  % represented bona fide non-coding rnas  <cit> . transdecoder predicted putative coding regions in  <dig> out of the  <dig>  possible protein-coding transcripts , but in just seven out of the  <dig> intergenic transcripts  and eleven out of the  <dig> antisense transcripts  . these proportions of putative coding regions in our candidate lncrna sets did not significantly differ from the proportions that transdecoder predicted in random regions . moreover, we did not find precedent for overlapping genes in p. falciparum  <cit> . given this body of data and the small proportion that the ambiguous transcripts represented in their respective data sets, we retained but noted these transcripts for further investigation .

lncrna transcript properties
after ensuring data integrity, including validating the non-coding nature of unannotated transcripts, we set out to characterize lncrna transcript properties. towards this end, we first compared the expression periodicity of lncrna transcripts to that of annotated mrna transcripts, as stage-specific expression is likely to correlate with function. indeed, when we visualized the expression of each transcript class in a non-clustering heatmap, we found a similar pattern of developmental regulation for both lncrnas and mrnas , although lncrnas typically reached lower maximum expression levels than mrnas . motif prediction in the putative promoter regions  of both lncrnas and mrnas also returned many motifs in common   <cit> . taken together, this global analysis revealed the remarkable similarity between lncrna and mrna expression cascades during blood stage development, and suggested stage-specific roles for p. falciparum lncrnas.table  <dig> global properties of p. falciparum lncrnas include reduced expression, length, gc content, and splicing as compared to annotated transcripts

we calculated the average of maximum fpkms and average of average fpkms across each transcript class during the 56-hour time course. average length and average gc content reflect exonic sequence only. annotated transcript properties refer to plasmodbv <dig>  transcript models



this visual approach also highlighted two distinct lncrna expression profile deviations during rbc rupture and parasite invasion . upon close inspection of the intergenic lncrna expression profiles shown in fig. 3b, we noted that a subset of intergenic lncrnas strongly peaked in expression during the  <dig> hpi invasion time-point. we found that this subset included all members of the family of telomere-associated lncrna-tares that we previously identified  <cit> . second, upon close inspection of the antisense rna expression profiles shown in fig. 3b, we noted a paucity of antisense transcript levels during parasite invasion. in fact, we calculated that out of the 35 % of antisense rnas  increasing in expression between 36– <dig> hpi, 72 % dropped in expression during parasite invasion and then increased in expression afterwards. a similar percentage of annotated mrna transcripts  increased in expression between 36– <dig> hpi, but only 19 % exhibited the invasion-specific expression drop .

we next investigated the correlation properties of p. falciparum lncrnas and annotated mrnas, as positive or negative correlation between lncrnas and neighboring genes may indicate a regulatory relationship  <cit> . specifically, we compared the expression correlation between randomly sampled mrnas  to that of the following location-dependent gene pairs:  annotated mrnas and their more correlated neighboring mrna,  intergenic lncrnas and their more correlated neighboring mrna, and  sense-antisense partners. we observed significantly more positively correlated intergenic lncrna-neighbor pairs and mrna-neighbor pairs than random mrna pairs  . on the other hand, we found that sense-antisense partners exhibited an entirely different expression correlation trend. namely, we observed significantly more negatively  correlated sense-antisense pairs than random mrna pairs  .

interestingly, we found that intergenic lncrna-neighbor pairs were significantly more positively correlated than mrna-neighbor pairs  . given this feature, we pursued numerous additional analyses of intergenic lncrna-neighbors and mrna-neighbors to explore whether positive correlation may be dependent on orientation and/or genomic distance between neighboring loci. in brief, we found that both lncrnas and mrnas had a significantly more correlated neighbor , that the distance between intergenic lncrna-neighbor pairs was not particularly indicative of higher correlation , and that lncrnas and mrnas were located at comparable distances from other annotated mrnas  . in terms of orientation, we found that expression correlation was equally distributed for tandem  and divergent  intergenic lncrna-neighbor pairs, although the expression correlation of convergent  pairs was similar to background correlation rates of mrna-neighbor pairs  . taken together, our results indicated that mrnas, intergenic lncrnas, and antisense rnas each have significantly different expression correlation properties with neighboring loci.

we next considered the gc content and length of lncrna transcripts. the gc content of intergenic lncrnas was generally lower than that of antisense rnas, which was lower than that of annotated transcripts . this was not surprising given the higher gc content of coding sequences, ribosomal rna, and transfer rna in the p. falciparum genome  <cit> . in terms of transcript length, both lncrna classes were quite long, with the average length of intergenic lncrnas, antisense rnas, and annotated transcripts being 1218 bp, 1413 bp, and 2197 bp, respectively . the small subset of relatively gc-rich  intergenic lncrnas generally corresponded to the subset of relatively long intergenic lncrnas , and included all members of the telomere-associated lncrna-tare family, whose high gc content and length we previously characterized   <cit> . the only two unannotated transcripts with greater than 40 % gc content shared 82 % pairwise sequence identity, and they were both situated between var pseudogenes and phistb genes. transdecoder predicted a coding region in one of these transcripts, and given their high gc content and sequence similarity, we reasoned that both of these transcripts likely represented unannotated pseudogenes.

we further considered the relative location of antisense rnas within annotated gene bodies and the splicing properties of lncrnas. this revealed that p. falciparum antisense rnas largely overlapped tail-to-tail with annotated genes, a property that has been described in previous viral, prokaryotic, and lower eukaryotic genome-wide studies   <cit> . specifically, the vast majority of p. falciparum antisense rnas initiated transcription downstream of annotated gene bodies and tended to terminate transcription towards the 3’ end of gene bodies as well . in terms of splicing, we found that  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of predicted intergenic lncrnas and antisense rnas were single exon, respectively, versus  <dig>  % of annotated transcripts .

notable lncrnas
based on the diverse characteristics examined above, we searched for transcripts with exceptional properties. for example, we found that a putative apicoplast rna methyltransferase precursor  and an early transcribed membrane protein  transcribe multi-exonic antisense rnas across their full gene bodies . expression of the apicoplast rna methyltransferase precursor sense-antisense pair was not particularly correlated , while expression of the etramp sense-antisense pair was moderately anti-correlated  . interestingly, etramp antisense transcription was substantially higher than etramp sense transcription, reaching a maximum fpkm of  <dig> in early stages. this was the highest expression level observed for predicted p. falciparum antisense rnas at any stage. both the apicoplast rna methyltransferase precursor and etramp antisense rnas also demonstrated the  <dig> hpi expression drop phenomenon, though their sense partners did not exhibit this pattern.fig.  <dig> notable lncrnas include multi-exonic and telomere-associated transcripts. / multi-exonic antisense transcripts span an apicoplast rna methyltransferase precursor  and an etramp  gene, respectively. annotated gene models are shown in dark green and dark blue, and assembled transcript models are shown in light green and light blue. reads from each 56-hour time course sample mapping to the  strand are shown below each horizontal axis in light green, while reads mapping to the  strand are shown above each horizontal axis in light blue. intron reads are shown in purple. uniqueness of 100mers is plotted in red as a mappability track. / pearson correlation between the pf3d7_ <dig> sense-antisense pair and etramp sense-antisense pair during the 56-hour time course was  <dig>  and − <dig> , respectively. notably, pf3d7_ <dig> and etramp antisense transcript levels dropped during parasite invasion, while sense transcript levels did not. expression is plotted in units of log <dig>   multi-exonic lncrnas are encoded in the pfgdv <dig> region on chromosome nine, antisense to pfgdv <dig> and between pfgdv <dig> and gexp <dig>  refer to / for a description of tracks. / pearson correlation between the pfgdv <dig> sense-antisense pair was  <dig> , while pearson correlation between the divergent intergenic lncrna and gexp <dig> pair was  <dig>  during the 56-hour time course. expression is plotted in units of log <dig>   as we have previously described, the telomere-associated repetitive element  2– <dig> region transcribes a family of lncrna-tares, with transcription always proceeding towards the telomere  <cit> . for example, lncrna-tare-2 l is transcribed on the left arm of chromosome two. pf3d7_ <dig> is a subtelomeric upsb-type pfemp1-encoding var gene. boundaries of the telomere, tares 1– <dig>  and rep <dig> are shown in purple. see / for a further description of tracks.  plotting the expression level of  <dig> lncrna-tare family members showed that lncrna-tare expression was co-regulated, with maximal firing coinciding with parasite invasion. expression is plotted in units of log <dig>   pearson correlation between lncrna-tare-2 l and the neighboring pfemp1-encoding var gene was − <dig>  during the 56-hour time course. expression is plotted in units of log2



remarkably, we also found that a region on chromosome nine required for early sexual development  <cit>  harbors a highly expressed, developmentally regulated, five-exon antisense transcript to p. falciparum gametocyte development protein  <dig> , as well as two intergenic lncrnas downstream of pfgdv <dig> . correlation during the 56-hour blood stage time course between pfgdv <dig> sense and antisense transcript levels was the highest of any predicted p. falciparum sense-antisense pair , with pfgdv <dig> antisense transcript levels typically exceeding pfgdv <dig> sense transcript levels . this was in sharp contrast to the majority of p. falciparum sense-antisense pairs, which displayed a trend towards anti-correlated expression. notably, while the expression correlation was again high between pfgdv <dig> sense-antisense transcript levels in the four biological replicate samples , the difference between transcript levels was greater, with the pfgdv <dig> antisense transcript reaching a maximum fpkm of  <dig> . the nearby, multi-exonic, intergenic lncrna exhibited moderately correlated expression to gexp <dig>  and evidence of alternative splicing  . in summary, the pfgdv <dig> antisense transcript’s expression properties, multi-exonic structure, and position relative to other genes made it a clear outlier in the genome.

while we have previously detected and characterized telomere-associated lncrna-tares, the properties of this yet to be annotated lncrna family again stood out in our analyses  <cit> . our results confirmed that lncrna-tares were long, high-gc, and transcribed towards the telomere . we also confirmed that lncrna-tare transcription was generally restricted to the expected tare 2– <dig> region, although we did find that in one case the entire tare 1– <dig> region was transcribed . to build on our previous results, long, paired-end, uniquely mapped sequencing reads showed that lncrna-tare transcripts likely originated from  <dig> chromosome ends in our parasite populations. moreover, the increased time resolution and scope of our samples showed that lncrna-tare transcript levels coordinately peaked during parasite invasion . interestingly, we found that sterile var transcript levels peaked during parasite invasion as well, but that not all var genes produced these non-coding transcripts   <cit> . for example, the subtelomeric var gene  neighboring lncrna-tare-2l was lowly expressed during the ring stage and did not produce appreciable sterile transcripts . collectively, these findings suggested co-regulated firing and coordinated function of lncrna-tare and sterile var transcripts during parasite invasion.

lncrna structural validation
to facilitate the future study of lncrnas, we sought to experimentally confirm novel lncrna transcript structures using pcr and sanger sequencing. towards this end, we amplified and sequenced across splice junctions predicted within the five-exon apicoplast rna methyltransferase precursor antisense transcript, three-exon etramp antisense transcript, and five-exon pfgdv <dig> antisense transcript. in total, sanger sequencing results confirmed nine lncrna junctions .

discovery and validation of circrnas in p. falciparum
to globally investigate rna circularization in p. falciparum, we used the analysis pipeline and criterion published by memczak et al.  <cit> . this approach identified  <dig> putative p. falciparum circrnas with at least two unique reads spanning their splice junction    <cit> . of these,  <dig> had five or more unique reads of support . as compared to the transcriptome-wide results reported in table  <dig>  we found that p. falciparum transcripts with predicted circrnas were more highly expressed on average . indeed, the circrna-producing gene set was enriched for ribosome-related components; ribosomal proteins are typically highly expressed .

in contrast to human circrnas, p. falciparum circrnas were generally predicted to be short, with the majority being less than 200 bp  <cit> . only  <dig> out of  <dig> predicted circrnas with at least two unique supporting reads were predicted to be 200 bp or longer. in the more stringent set of  <dig> circrna candidates with at least five unique supporting reads, only  <dig> were predicted to be 200 bp or longer. we defined circrna size as the genomic distance between predicted donor site and acceptor site, inclusive of the donor and acceptor site. thus, this should be read as a maximum size, as circrnas can span introns, which may be spliced out of the circrna sequence. in summary, short circrnas appeared to outnumber longer circrnas in p. falciparum and deserve further attention.

we predicted an intriguing top p. falciparum circrna candidate within the apoptosis-related protein , termed arp_circrna .  <dig> unique reads spanned the predicted splice junction between arp’s exon- <dig> donor site  and upstream exon- <dig> acceptor site  . to validate that this non-canonical splice junction was not the result of a library preparation or sequencing artifact, we reverse-transcribed total rna and amplified the predicted arp_circrna junction from the resulting complementary dna  using pcr and divergent primer pairs. we designed divergent arp_circrna primer pairs, as is depicted in fig. 5b, such that primer pairs could not amplify genomic dna  or cdna in the absence of the predicted arp_circrna splice junction.fig.  <dig> divergent primers and sanger sequencing validate circrna splicing in p. falciparum.
 the apoptosis-related protein  encodes a predicted circrna, termed arp_circrna, consisting of arp exon- <dig> and exon- <dig> sequence.  to validate the non-canonical exon- <dig> donor /exon- <dig> acceptor  splice junction in arp_circrna, we designed a divergent pcr primer pair. the primer pair is considered to be divergent, rather than convergent, because the reverse primer binds upstream of the forward primer.  pcr using divergent primers amplified a product of the expected size  when the template was cdna from either time course, but not water or gdna. the larger products in the divergent cdna reactions may represent non-specific or rolling-circle reverse transcription products  <cit> . on the other hand, pcr using convergent primers amplified products of the expected size when the template was cdna from either time course or gdna. we confirmed that the smaller product size in the case of convergent cdna reactions corresponded to intron removal.  sanger sequencing of divergent amplicons of the expected size confirmed the arp_circrna junction in both time courses. the extra gtag in the predicted sequence marks the non-canonical arp_circrna splice junction 



our results confirmed the non-canonical arp_circrna splice junction in cdna preparations from either biological replicate time course. specifically, the arp_circrna divergent primer pair produced amplicons of the expected size when the template was cdna, and did not produce specific amplicons with gdna or water as the template. on the other hand, the arp_circrna convergent primer pair amplified both cdna and gdna, with the smaller product size in the cdna reactions corresponding to intron removal . we further confirmed the identity of the arp_circrna divergent and convergent amplicons by sanger sequencing. sequence confirmation for the arp_circrna divergent amplicon is shown in fig. 5d, where the gtag splice donor-acceptor tag is included in the predicted sequence as a marker for the circrna splice junction.

we used the same experimental strategy of divergent pcr followed by sanger sequencing to validate additional p. falciparum circrna candidates. in total, we were able to validate six out of nine tested candidates . we selected the nine tested candidates according to certain criterion: read support, a donor or acceptor site in common with an annotated transcript, predicted size of at least 200 bp , and not within a ribosomal gene. two of the additional validated p. falciparum circrnas were associated with genes of unknown function, two were predicted within rhoptry-related genes, and the final validated candidate was within metacaspase-like protein , which is another gene involved in apoptosis. as has been suggested across other organisms, temporal expression of validated circrnas was moderately correlated with that of their linear counterparts   <cit> .

interestingly, using the recently described paccmit-cds algorithm, we found that our experimentally validated circrna candidates each contained predicted human microrna binding sites   <cit> . moreover, when we broadly searched plasmodbv <dig>  transcripts for human microrna binding sites, we found thousands of significant hits and that  <dig> transcripts harbored at least  <dig> predicted binding sites for a given human microrna  . at the highest stringency level , the gametocyte-specific transcript pf11- <dig>  harbored an impressive  <dig> predicted human microrna binding sites. taken together, we have predicted an unexpectedly widespread capacity for p. falciparum transcripts to form stable circular structures, as well as to bind human micrornas.

discussion
the mechanisms underpinning gene regulation in p. falciparum malaria remain largely uncharacterized  <cit> . however, long non-coding rnas  have been found to initiate and guide the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic status of specific loci across a broad range of organisms  <cit> . encouraged by these features and our previous discovery of an intriguing family of telomere-associated lncrnas in p. falciparum, we have developed strand-specific p. falciparum rna sequencing methods, deeply sequenced fifteen blood stage samples, and compiled a comprehensive catalog of p. falciparum lncrna transcript properties.

our results have several implications for parasite biology. for example, we observed numerous negatively correlated, tail-to-tail overlapping sense-antisense transcript pairs. this is consistent with a potential role for many p. falciparum antisense rnas in transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation of their sense mrna partners  <cit> . for example, a subset of p. falciparum antisense rnas may function through transcriptional interference, as has been extensively studied in saccharomyces cerevisiae . in the transcriptional interference model, antisense transcription interferes with sense transcription through either polymerase collisions or alternative mechanisms. as an alternative or additional model, antisense-mediated transcriptional suppression is also possible and has been described in human studies . in antisense-mediated transcriptional suppression, antisense rnas act as epigenetic silencers, catalyzing local heterochromatin formation.

we also observed rapid depletion of antisense transcript levels  during invasion. this pattern is intriguing and suggests that a specific subset of transcripts may be targeted for degradation during this critical timeframe. notably, we were not able to identify evidence of degraded transcripts in our dataset, though the size selections imposed during library preparation would likely eliminate such fragments.

searching our catalog for p. falciparum lncrnas with unique properties revealed that an essential protein in early gametocyte development, pfgdv <dig>  has a highly and coordinately expressed, multi-exonic antisense counterpart, as well as multiple neighboring intergenic lncrnas. though the regulation and mechanism of early gametocyte development events remain largely unknown, eksi et al. have shown that pfgdv <dig> complementation restores gametocytogenesis in pfgdv1-null parasites, and that episomal pfgdv <dig> over-expression increases gametocytemia in wild-type parasites  <cit> . this suggests that endogenous pfgdv <dig> expression levels likely correlate with gametocytemia, and that silencing the endogenous pfgdv <dig> locus could disrupt transmission. notably, kafsack et al. have also shown that a member of the apiap <dig> transcription factor family is involved in early gametocyte development  <cit> . however, loss of this factor did not affect pfgdv <dig> transcript levels  <cit> , suggesting that the pfgdv <dig> locus may integrate different or additional regulatory signals.

in light of these recent findings, and given that future strategies to block malaria transmission largely hinge on blocking the development of transmissible p. falciparum sexual stages, we highlight here the need for further study of the pfgdv1-associated lncrnas . specifically, we propose that single-cell experiments and dissection of the pfgdv <dig> locus using genome editing techniques may reveal a regulatory role for p. falciparum lncrnas in early gametocyte commitment events, perhaps similar to s. cerevisiae lncrna-mediated entry into meiosis  <cit> . in this system, lncrna transcription through the s. cerevisiae inducer of meiosis ime <dig> promoter region and ime <dig> antisense transcription are incompatible with ime1/ime <dig> sense transcription.

we have previously described and hypothesized that a family of telomere-associated lncrna-tare transcripts is involved in telomere maintenance and/or subtelomeric var gene regulation  <cit> . supporting such nuclear roles, siegel et al. then reported significant enrichment of telomere-associated p. falciparum lncrnas in the nuclear, as opposed to total and cytoplasmic, p. falciparum rna fractions  <cit> . adding to the lncrna-tare family profile, we have now shown that lncrna-tare transcripts are maximally expressed during parasite invasion, along with the sterile, non-coding var transcripts transcribed from bidirectional var intron promoters  <cit> . when parasites invade rbcs pre-loaded with episomal pfemp1-encoding var genes, these episomal var genes are not silenced during the first ring stage. var gene silencing is, however, somehow established by the subsequent ring stage and then remains the default status  <cit> . while it has been hypothesized that passage through s-phase is the critical requirement for var gene silencing, we suggest that expression of non-coding transcripts during parasite invasion may play an important regulatory role as well  <cit> . high-resolution studies of chromatin mark dynamics over episomal and endogenous var loci during parasite invasion may help to resolve these models.

this work represents the validation of six p. falciparum circrnas, as well as the prediction of hundreds more. we stress, however, that further curation of our circrna predictions will be required, as in silico prediction algorithms may yield false positives and pcr failures may yield false negatives for low copy number targets or otherwise. with this said, a more focused sequencing effort using circrna-specific protocol adjustments may reveal even more abundance of this intriguing class of non-coding rna. in support of this notion, most of our predicted p. falciparum circrnas were shorter than the average library fragment size, and thus could be selected against during library preparation. moreover, wang et al. recently mined the siegel et al. rna sequencing data set and validated two low-abundance p. falciparum circrnas  <cit> . as we did not find evidence for either of these candidates in our study, this further hints that library preparation and/or bioinformatic processing may be tunable to capture additional p. falciparum circrnas. alternatively, as our sample sets differed, these circrnas may be highly linked to the phenotypic state of the parasite.

notably, memczak et al. and others have hypothesized that circrnas may function as microrna sponges, and have demonstrated a handful of supporting examples  <cit> . in this model, the circrnas behave as competitive inhibitors, sponging up micrornas to reduce the microrna pool available to bind messenger rna targets. given that the lack of p. falciparum-encoded micrornas and microrna processing machinery has been extensively established, we did not anticipate microrna sponge roles for p. falciparum circrnas  <cit> . moreover, the only reported function for human micrornas in p. falciparum involves microrna integration into parasite transcripts rather than binding interactions  <cit> . nonetheless, we were curious to investigate the capacity for human micrornas to bind within our set of validated circrna transcripts and within p. falciparum transcripts more generally. challenging our a priori expectations, we predicted human microrna binding sites within each validated circrna, as well as across thousands of p. falciparum transcripts. taken together, our results may point to additional functions for circrnas across eukaryotes and/or to undiscovered functions for human micrornas in p. falciparum gene regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we develop strand-specific non-polya-selected next generation sequencing methods sensitive to the extreme at content of p. falciparum. we then apply these methods to the transcriptome-wide assembly and characterization of p. falciparum intergenic lncrna and antisense rna properties. our results support the conserved regulatory capacity of non-coding elements in p. falciparum, with different transcripts demonstrating distinct regulatory signatures, such as stage-specific expression, rapid firing, rapid destabilization, transcriptional interference, and circularization. in addition to a highly curated lncrna transcript catalog, we provide structural validation of three exceptional multi-exonic lncrnas and six circrnas. this work coupled with recent advancements in p. falciparum genome editing will greatly facilitate further insights into the function of these lncrnas in p. falciparum  <cit> .
