BACKGROUND
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor  promotes the survival, differentiation and proliferation of cells of the neutrophilic lineage  <cit> . it belongs to the group of lineage-specific hematopoietic colony growth factors. however, g-csf is able to pass the blood-brain-barrier despite of its high molecular weight  <cit> . moreover, in the central nervous system  g-csf is produced endogenously by neurons and its production can be enhanced by exogenous stimuli such as hypoxia  <cit> . the g-csf receptor , which is a single transmembrane protein, was recently found to be widely expressed in the cns of adult rodents and humans  <cit> . recombinant g-csf was first approved by the fda in  <dig> for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia to lower the incidence of infections  <cit> , and thus is a well established clinical drug with a favourable safety profile. besides occasional bone pain, subcutaneous administration of g-csf results in elevated white blood cell counts. however, long-term application of g-csf for patients with chronic neutropenia was safe, particularly in regard to hematological malignancies  <cit> .

in analogy to its anti-apoptotic effect in the hematopoietic system, g-csf was recently found to reduce infarct volume and to improve functional recovery in rodent studies of acute and subacute stroke  <cit> . consequently, several stroke trials on humans have been conducted . one small study with  <dig> patients showed reduced functional deficits after  <dig> months of treatment compared to the control group  <cit> . recently, we corroborated the neuroprotective effect of g-csf in the mptp model of parkinson's disease  <cit>  and g-csf was furthermore shown to attenuate striatal degeneration in a rodent model for huntington's disease  <cit> . moreover, elevated g-csf levels were found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a possible endogenous neuroprotective effect of g-csf for chronic neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . in addition to direct neuroprotective and -regenerative effects mediated by g-csfr expressed in the cns, indirect mechanisms based on systemic g-csf effects have also been discussed, such as immunomodulatory effects or the mobilization of bone marrow stem cells  <cit> .

here, we study the neuroprotective effect of g-csf in the rat optic nerve  transection model. on axotomy leads to retrograde degeneration of 85% of the retinal ganglion cells  within  <dig> days. in contrast to most other in vivo models for neurodegeneration, death of axotomized rgcs fulfils all criteria of apoptosis  <cit> . besides classic morphological signs  <cit> , axotomized rgcs show activation of caspase- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit>  antagonistic regulation of bax and bcl- <dig> expression  <cit> , downregulation of apoptosis-inhibiting activities of ras/raf/erk or pi3k/akt kinases  <cit>  and protective effects of caspase inhibitors  <cit>  and neurotrophins  <cit> . due to the possibility of either systemic or intraocular application, the optic nerve transection paradigm permits to compare both routes of application for neuroprotective agents.

the on axotomy model is thus an elegant in vivo paradigm for neurodegenerative diseases. in addition, with respect to the pressure-induced axonal damage found as a pathophysiological mechanism in glaucoma, it also reflects the selective degeneration of rgcs in this ophtalmological disease, which often continues despite adequate lowering of the intraocular pressure  <cit> .

in summary, we found further evidence suggesting that g-csf, a drug which has been in clinical use for almost twenty years with a very good safety record, is a potential clinical treatment option for both neurodegenerative diseases and glaucoma. moreover, we show that in the in vivo model used here, local application of g-csf to retinal ganglion cells is sufficient to induce neuroprotective effects independent of systemic mechanisms.

RESULTS
g-csf receptor expression in retinal ganglion cells in vivo
using immunohistochemical staining with an antibody raised against the c-terminus of the g-csfr we found expression in the retinal ganglion cell layer . dapi counterstaining showed that immunoreactivity could be found on rgc somata, but no axonal or dendritic staining was observed. g-csfr staining was largely restricted to the rgc layer, with only low immunoreactivity, hardly exceeding background levels, in the remaining retinal layers. prelabelling of rgcs by injection of a retrograde tracer  into the superior colliculus, resulting in retrograde, specific staining of rgcs, demonstrated that almost all rgcs were immunoreactive for g-csfr protein . g-csfr immunoreactivity remained unchanged  <dig> and  <dig> days after axotomy .

in vivo protective effects of systemic g-csf application
based on the positive g-csfr immunoreactivity on rgcs, we asked whether g-csf is able to prevent rgc degeneration following axotomy due to optic nerve transection. similar to earlier data  <cit> , we observed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  surviving rgcs/mm <dig>  <dig> days after optic nerve transection and daily subcutaneous vehicle injection . based on g-csf dosing in previous in vivo neuroprotection experiments  <cit> , we then applied a daily dose of  <dig> or  <dig> μg/kg bodyweight  g-csf subcutaneously, with the first injection approximately  <dig> h after axotomy. while application of  <dig> μg/kg bw showed a non-significantly enhanced survival of rgcs , a dose of  <dig> μg/kg bw g-csf s.c. resulted in a highly significant neuroprotective effect .

cell numbers are given as mean ± s.e.m. s.c.: subcutaneous; i.o.: intraocular; bw: bodyweight.

next, we tested whether additional pre-treatment with  <dig> μg/kg bw g-csf s.c. starting one day before axotomy could further increase rgc survival. we found that this pre-treatment resulted in a slight, but non-significant increase in rgc numbers compared to treatment starting after the lesion .

g-csf enhances survival of immunopurified rgcs deprived of neurotrophic factors
although distinct neuronal subtypes express the g-csfr, indirect mechanisms based on systemic g-csf effects have also been discussed as a mechanism for g-csf neuroprotection. therefore, in order to find further evidence for a direct action of g-csf on rgcs, we employed immunopurified rat rgc cultures. immunopurified rat rgcs provide a well-established in vitro model for studies on retinal ganglion cell death and apoptosis of cns neurons in general. moreover, they share important aspects of cell survival mechanisms with in situ rgcs  <cit> . a two-step immunopurification protocol  <cit>  was used to purify rgcs to near homogeneity. subsequently the cells were cultured in serum-free medium, supplemented with the neurotrophic factors forskolin, human bdnf, cntf, and insulin . g-csfr expression in purified rgcs was confirmed by rt-pcr and immunocytochemistry . after  <dig> day in culture, neurotrophins were withdrawn, and the number of surviving rgcs was determined after an additional  <dig> d in vitro. when g-csf was added concomitantly with the neurotrophin deprivation, survival of immunopurified rgcs was enhanced significantly , suggesting a direct neuroprotective effect of g-csf on rgcs.

topical application is sufficient for g-csf-mediated neuroprotection in vivo
our in vivo optic nerve transection paradigm offers the advantage that protective compounds can be applied locally to the neuronal population of interest by direct intravitreal injection. we thus performed intravitreal injections of vehicle or g-csf at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after axotomy  in order to test whether systemic effects are required for g-csf neuroprotection in vivo. we confirmed that, in contrast to the expected higher leukocyte counts after subcutaneous g-csf application, the intraocular injection protocol did not increase blood leukocyte numbers . in agreement with the observed protective effect of g-csf on purified rgcs in culture, we found that direct intraocular application of g-csf was sufficient for neuroprotective effects , and did not significantly differ from the effect of  <dig> μg/kg bw g-csf given subcutaneously .

discussion
g-csfr expression on neurons has been demonstrated few years ago  <cit> , and g-csfr expression by neuronal and non-neuronal cells has recently been identified in numerous regions of the brain  <cit> . besides other cell types, it was lately found to be expressed by neuronal populations that are subject to cell death in neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. motoneurons  or dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra  <cit> .

similar to the expression pattern of the erythropoietin receptor , another hematopoietic cytokine with neuroprotective action, we show for the first time constitutive expression of the g-csfr on the somata of rgcs. in contrast to the epor  <cit>  we could not find g-csfr expression on the dendrites of the rgcs in vivo. our finding that the g-csfr is expressed by rgcs prompted us to investigate possible neuroprotective effects of g-csf on rgcs. we demonstrate profound neuroprotection against axotomy-induced rgc death through g-csf.  <dig> μg/kg bw s.c. lead to a significant attenuation of rgc cell loss after optic nerve transection even when g-csf was given after lesioning. the mode of rgc death in the model we used was shown to homogenously exhibit classical features of apoptosis  <cit> . thus, based on the large body of evidence showing almost exclusively apoptotic cell death in this paradigm, the substantial reduction in rgc death can be explained by an anti-apoptotic activity of g-csf. an impact of g-csf on other confounding parameters, e.g. on the retrograde transport of fluorogold, is theoretically possible. however, retrograde fluorogold labelling of rgcs is already completed two days after axotomy  <cit> , while rats were processed  <dig> days after axotomy in our experiments. moreover, fluorogold was proven to be a reliable marker for rgc survival that correlates well with markers for apoptosis, also under treatment with protective neurotrophins or cytokines in several studies  <cit> . finally, our data from purified rgc primary cultures further support an anti-apoptotic effect of g-csf independent from retrograde axonal dye transport.

it has been postulated that g-csf may confer an improved outcome in animal stroke models by bone marrow stem cell mobilization and migration to the lesion site, followed by neuronal differentiation  <cit> . additional systemic mechanisms could be postulated, as g-csf has prominent systemic anti-inflammatory properties  <cit>  that might contribute to its neuroprotective action in this model. in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis  model of multiple sclerosis, g-csf was found to reduce t-cell-recruitment to the cns and protected from further inflammation  <cit> . moreover, g-csf could be neuroprotective by indirect mechanisms, e.g. inducing the release of neurotrophic factors from glial cells  <cit> . however, g-csf might also act directly on neural cells after systemic application as it passes the intact blood brain barrier  <cit> . furthermore, we  and others  <cit>  found the g-csfr expressed on neuronal target cells, and neuroprotection was described in cultures of neuronal cell lines free of non-neuronal cells, suggesting a direct protective action of g-csf within the nervous system  <cit> . our data presented here show that local application of g-csf to the retina is sufficient to induce neuroprotection in vivo. moreover, the results from our in vitro experiments using primary cultures of immunopurified rgcs argue in favour of a direct inhibition of neuron-specific apoptotic pathways by activation of neuronal g-csfr. nevertheless, this does not exclude an additional contribution of the above mentioned indirect mechanisms, e.g. glial cell-derived neurotrophic factors. similarly, potential systemic effects that might partially contribute to g-csf neuroprotection beyond its local activity can not be excluded at this point. however, the finding of substantial cns neuroprotection after local injection of g-csf could become of clinical relevance if, in order to avoid potential unwanted systemic effects of g-csf, intracerebral or intrathecal administration will be tested in future treatment studies for neurodegenerative diseases.

in contrast to most other neurotrophic molecules, g-csf is already used in clinical practice for many years to treat neutropenic patients, e.g. after chemotherapy or in cases of severe congenital neutropenia. especially the latter application, which often requires g-csf treatment for many years, yielded valuable safety data showing that also long-term treatment with g-csf is principally possible  <cit> . thus, g-csf could be immediately transferred to clinical studies. nevertheless, a safety record for the chronic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with g-csf, also with respective dose-finding studies, will have to be performed in phase iia/b studies.

as already outlined in the introduction, cell death in our optic nerve transection model displays the properties of classical neuronal apoptosis. therefore, it provides an elegant opportunity to study potential new treatment concepts for neurodegenerative diseases in an in vivo model. in addition, our model replicates important steps in the pathologic course of glaucoma, because axonal lesions due to increased ocular tension are thought to induce retrograde rgc death and vision loss  <cit> . therefore, besides its potential usefulness for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, g-csf may also be a powerful add-on drug to stop rgc degeneration and to stop or slow down vision loss, especially since lowering the intraocular pressure does not necessarily halt the continuous degeneration of rgcs. further, autoantibody-induced rgc apoptosis is a possible mechanism of autoimmune retinopathy in cancer patients and may represent another potential therapeutic application for g-csf in ophthalmology  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we provide further support for the use of g-csf as a neuroprotective molecule that could be transferred to clinical application in the near future. we demonstrate that g-csf exerts neuroprotection after local delivery to cns neurons in vivo and may also become a valuable therapeutic option in ophthalmology.
