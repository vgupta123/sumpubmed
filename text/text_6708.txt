BACKGROUND
endophytic fungi live within healthy plants without causing any apparent symptoms of disease  <cit> . in natural ecosystems, endophytic fungi have been isolated from almost all plants studied so far. they confer abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, increase biomass, and decrease water consumption of the host plant  <cit> . in recent years, they have been received increasing attention from natural product chemists due to their various novel and bioactive compounds  <cit> . the functions of bioactive natural products include antibiotics, anticancer agents, agrichemicals, and other bioactive compounds  <cit> . some of them could be developed into leads for therapeutics, such as the well-known taxol  <cit> . in addition, fungal endophyte is also proposed to be potential source of biocatalysts  <cit> . endophytes as important biological resources are waiting to be exploited.

the genus pestalotiopsis  includes many widely distributed species, occurring on a wide range of substrata such as on living plants as pathogens and endophytes and on dead plant materials as saprobes  <cit> . however, pestalotiopsis spp. have been extensively isolated from healthy plant tissues and considered as a main part of endophytes in the past decade  <cit> . the chemical investigations showed that pestalotiopsis spp. are important resource for natural product discovery  <cit> .

pestalotiopsis fici steyaert was first identified as a pathogen of ficus carica  <cit> . however, a strain of p. fici  was isolated as endophyte from the branches of camellia sinensis in hangzhou, china. chemical investigations revealed that this strain produces  <dig> secondary metabolites including  <dig> new natural products  <cit> . those include, for instance, pestaloficiols a-l and q-s  <cit> , pestalofones a-h  <cit> , pestalodiols a-d  <cit> , chloropupukeananin which is the first chlorinated pupukeanane derivative discovered in fungi  <cit> , chloropestolides a-g with unprecedented spiroketal skeleton  <cit> , chloropupukeanone a  <cit> , chloropupukeanolides a-e  <cit> . those compounds have shown various bioactivities, including inhibition of hiv- <dig> replication, cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines, and antifungal effects against aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the biosynthesis pathways for some of these secondary metabolites include a diels-alder reaction, which is vital for the observed abundance of secondary metabolites  <cit> . although putative biosynthesis pathways of some secondary metabolites are postulated, the actual biosynthetic pathways remain to be confirmed. however, access to the genes involved in secondary metabolism has been greatly enhanced, as the putative genes encoding for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites can easily be detected by in silico analysis of genomic data  <cit> .

both lifestyle and richness of secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi have not been comprehensive understood. in this study, the p. fici genome was sequenced and annotated. the gene families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes especially pectinases and transporters have undergone expansion. a large set of genes involved in secondary metabolism has been identified. the genomic information provides insight on how the living strategy as endophyte and how the richness and diversity of secondary metabolites.

RESULTS
tea branch colonization by pestalotiopsis fici
although p. fici was isolated as endophyte from the tea plant, the detailed knowledge about fungal colonization strategy is unknown. the twigs of the tea tree were inoculated with fresh mycelium of the gfp transformant of p. fici  and the colonization pattern was documented over a period of 21 days by confocal microscopy. a few hyphae were observed at seven  and 21 days  after inoculation respectively, in the living tea twigs without any disease symptoms.figure  <dig>

general genome features
the p. fici genome was assembled into  <dig> scaffolds  with n <dig> of 4 mb encompassing 52 mb . a total of  <dig>  genes were predicted, including  <dig>  orthologous genes and  <dig>  genes containing at least one domain/motif . among them,  <dig> genes were pseudogenes. repetitive sequences, including  <dig> % simple repeats,  <dig> % low complexity repeats, and  <dig> % transposable elements , made up only  <dig> % of the genome of p. fici. the tes were identified, grouped, and annotated as class  <dig> , class  <dig>  or unknown tes using the repet pipeline and repbase. the ltr group in class  <dig> comprised of two families: gypsy and copia. ripcal analysis showed index values of  <dig>  for /tpa and  <dig>  for /, which suggested heavy repeat-induced point mutation  in the p. fici genome and that the rip mutation was a classical pattern of cpa→tpa .table  <dig>

one of the most novel characteristics of the p. fici genome was that it contained more multigene families, compared with those of other reference ascomyceteous fungi in this study. the multigene families in the p. fici genome are  <dig>  that are similar to that in the genome of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete, laccaria bicolor . the average number of proteins per family in p. fici  was much higher than in other pezizomycotina species  but was similar to the endophytic basidiomycete, piriformospora indica  . the p. fici genome, however, contained a large number of replicated gene pairs with amino acid identities below 80% .figure  <dig>

cafÉ analysis revealed that  <dig>  families had expanded in the p. fici genome , indicated a considerable protein family expansion. the number of expanded gene family was significantly higher for p. fici than that of the reference fungi. gene family expansion occurred in those genes encoding for cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , heterokaryon incompatibility, major facilitator superfamily , short-chain dehydrogenase, tyrosinase, intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase, methyltransferase type, and cysteine-rich fungal-specific extracellular egf-like  domain-containing protein . the expanded gene families of the p. fici genome seem to be mainly involved in processes like secondary metabolism, pheromone response, detoxification, and virulence .figure  <dig>

carbohydrate-active enzymes  in p. fici
fungi can utilize monosaccharides or oligosaccharides, which were degraded from polysaccharides by secreting a variety of cazymes. p. fici has the highest number of putative cazymes genes  and the most abundant cazyme families , compared with those of  <dig> other genome-sequenced fungi , followed by parasites, saprophytes, and symbionts. these expanded cazyme arsenals of p. fici are similar to those of fusarium oxysporum and f. verticillioides, and the total cazyme repertoire for p. fici is similar to that of f. oxysporum and nectria haematococca. interestingly, those fungi  and p. fici are known to be pathogen on some host plants, but have been isolated as endophytes from others  <cit> .figure  <dig>

and  <dig> other fungal genomes. the numbers of enzyme modules in each genome are indicated and the background color changes from white to red are depicted as binary logarithm of folds  of each cazyme family gene numbers of each genome divided average each cazyme family gene numbers of all genomes analyzed. cazyme categories included glycoside hydrolase , glycosyl transferase , polysaccharide lyase  and carbohydrate esterase .



our analysis showed an extreme increase in the number of enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall  oligosaccharides and polysaccharides . compared with other sequenced fungi, p. fici has a higher number of candidate pectinases and covers all pectinase families known from fungi, including polysaccharide lyase family  <dig> , pl <dig>  pl <dig>  pl <dig>  glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> , gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> . the predominant families of pectinases in the p. fici genome are pl <dig> and gh <dig>  having  <dig> and  <dig> encoding genes, respectively . the results of subcellular localization of cazymes show that almost all the pectinases are secreted . as a component of the vegetal cell wall and the intercellular spaces, pectin might provide nutrient for endophytic fungi.

chitin deacetylase modules in the carbohydrate esterase family  <dig>  can convert surface-exposed chitin into chitosan to avoid host detection  <cit> . like the ectomycorrhizal fungus l. bicolor, p. fici has up to  <dig> ce <dig> modules that can benefit the endophyte by reducing its detection by the plant host .

expanded transporter gene families
the transportation system is involved in uptake of essential nutrients and ions, excretion of metabolic end products and deleterious substances, and communication between cells and the environment  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  genes encoding transporters were identified in the p. fici genome . the average index of expansion estimated by cafÉ software was higher in the p. fici genome  than in the  <dig> other analyzed genomes, indicating the significant expansion of this group of genes in p. fici.

mfs transporters are involved in the transport of monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, inositols, drugs, amino acids, nucleosides, organophosphate esters, krebs cycle metabolites, and a large variety of organic and inorganic anions and cations  <cit> . compared with the reference fungi, a significant increase in mfs transporters was observed in the p. fici genome, and a total of  <dig> mfs transporter-encoding genes in  <dig> different families were predicted, accounting for 68% of secondary transporters . the gene number of sugar porter  family of mfs subfamily was higher in the p. fici genome , indicating the uptake of more plant-produced nutrients. comparative analysis with other fungi revealed that the drug:h+ antiporter- <dig>  and dha <dig> family genes are overrepresented in the p. fici genome, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, suggesting export of more metabolism production . the anion:cation symporter  family had significantly expanded in the p. fici genome, i.e., p. fici had  <dig> acs family genes, that is four times higher than average found in other studied genomes . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> belong to the tna <dig> clade, a high affinity nicotinate permease that catalyzes nicotinic acid  uptake, reflecting that p. fici might be dependent from the host plant for vitamin b <dig> supply.

great biosynthetic capabilities of secondary metabolites in p. fici
secondary metabolites are involved in intracellular, intercellular, and interspecific interactions  <cit> . pestalotiopsis fici produces a wide variety of secondary metabolites, and this motivated us to find the molecular basis of this production by genome sequencing. the average number of core genes related to secondary metabolites synthesis in ascomycetes is only  <dig> . however, we identified  <dig> core genes related to secondary metabolism including  <dig> polyketide synthase ,  <dig> non-ribosomal peptide synthases , five dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases , four putative pks-like enzymes,  <dig> putative nrps-like enzymes,  <dig> terpenoid synthases , seven terpenoid cyclases , seven fatty-acid synthases  and five pks-nrps hybrids . besides the core genes, the tailing genes, regulators, transporters, and other genes that often clustered with the core genes are required for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in fungi. the prediction resulted from the combination of smurf and antismash illustrated that the majority of these core enzymes distributed into  <dig> secondary metabolite clusters , which is much more than the reference fungi containing an average of  <dig> gene clusters. among the  <dig> gene clusters, 32% contained at least one mfs transporter that might export metabolites out of cell and approximately 24% contained the ‘narrow’-domain tfs zn2-cys <dig> that may regulate the expression of gene clusters.table  <dig>

as shown in figure  <dig>  out of the  <dig> gene clusters detected in the genome sequence of p. fici, only  <dig> were identified to be active by expression profiling . notably, these data, along with the results on the numerous novel secondary metabolites already obtained, indicate the huge potential for the production of secondary metabolites of this fungus.figure  <dig>

fungal pks genes are mainly type i iterative pkss  that are further classified into fungal reducing pkss  and non-reducing pkss  based on the degree of reduction in their final products. although the numbers of pks genes are similar to those in plant pathogens, such as magnaporthe oryzae  and glomerella graminicola , pks genes in p. fici are more diverse, including three nrpks genes, one type iii pks gene , a 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase  gene, five hybrids of pks and nrps, and  <dig> rpkss. in addition, pks domain of pks-nrps hybrid is usually followed by nrps domain in fungal genomes. interestingly, four among the five pks-nrps hybrids from the p. fici genome are that nrps domain is followed by pks domain .

the ks domain is the most conserved and can be used to infer the genealogy of the pks genes. phylogenetic analysis based on ks domains showed that the p. fici proteins grouped in different clusters. one 6-msas  and four nrps-pks hybrid genes  from the p. fici genome are nested in the bacterial pks clade . hybrid pks-nrps genes pfici_ <dig> were grouped with several hybrid pks-nrps genes from m. oryzae and g. graminicola in the subclade iv of rpks clade, which were composed of a rpks and a truncated nrps module. the pks gene pfici_ <dig> was grouped with the lovastatin non-ketide synthase encoding gene mgg_11638t <dig>  the pks gene pfici_ <dig> was grouped with the fumonisins encoding gene fgsg_01790t <dig>  and they shared the same domain structure. in addition, pks gene pfici_ <dig> shared the same domain structure with pfici_ <dig>  the pks gene pfici_ <dig> was within the melanin pigment group, including the known pigment encoding genes mgg_07219t <dig> and glrg_ <dig>  the pks gene pfici_ <dig> shared 59% similarity with the gene fgsg_09182t <dig> that encodes for biosynthesis of the violet pigment in f. graminearum. however, modular analysis showed that pfici_ <dig> included a more reducing domain . the similarity between pfici_ <dig> and pfici_ <dig> , pfici_ <dig> and pfici_ <dig> , pfici_ <dig> and pfici_ <dig> , and pfici_ <dig> and pfici_ <dig>  respectively indicated that they were resulted from recent gene duplication.

putative genes for the diels-alder reaction
the diels-alder reaction is the most important step for the transformation in the biosynthesis of cyclohexene-containing secondary metabolites. diels-alderases in the prokaryotic actinobacterium saccharopolyspora spinosa have been identified  <cit> . although the diels-alderases in fungi have not been well documented, several purified enzymes, such as macrophomate synthase  <cit> , have been suggested to involve in the diels-alder-type cycloaddition. the p. fici genome contained the most putative genes  encoding diels-alderases, followed by the verticillium albo-atrum genome, with only  <dig> genes . of the  <dig> putative genes in p. fici,  <dig> were located in gene clusters involved in secondary metabolism. phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the putative diels-alderase genes in p. fici were grouped into different clades, suggested that they had higher diversity .

discussion
pestalotiopsis fici genome harbors more multigene families but lacks highly similar paralogs. the genome analysis of neurospora crassa and f. graminearum has indicated that the process of rip, in which duplicated sequences are subject to extensive mutation, may result in the lack of highly duplicated sequences  <cit> . the coexistence of more multigene families and higher rip in p. fici genome supports the viewpoint that gene duplication has occurred before the emergence of rips proposed for the n. crassa genome  <cit> .

the fungal endophyte-plant host interaction has been hypothesized to be determined by a finely tuned equilibrium between fungal virulence and plant defense  <cit> . endophyte-like pathogens possess virulence factors that are countered by plant defense  <cit> . the gene families involved in detoxification and virulence have undergone expansion in the p. fici genome, which may help p. fici counter the plant host. cyps are involved in many essential cellular processes, such as the conversion of hydrophobic intermediates of primary and secondary metabolic pathways and the detoxification of natural and environmental pollutants  <cit> . the expanded cyps in the p. fici genome mainly participate in primary metabolism, secondary metabolism, defense against host-secreted factors, and xenobiotic metabolism . cyps also evolve and thereby help fungi adapt to different ecological niches  <cit> . the cyp <dig> families, involved in defense against host secreting factors, had also undergone expansion in the p. fici genome . the high diversity of secondary metabolites is related to the diversity of the cyp genes. for example, the  <dig> cyp genes in the ganoderma lucidum genome resulted in a large number of different secondary metabolites  <cit> . the cyp families in p. fici associated with secondary metabolism such as cyp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had undergone significant expansion.

the cazymes analysis provides useful information about fungal life strategies  <cit> . though it lacks experimental supports, the numbers of cazymes seem to relate to the nutritional availability  <cit>  and lifestyle of fungi associated with plant. obligate parasitic fungi deriving nutrients from living tissues have the fewest cazymes  <cit> , followed by biotrophic pathogens, symbiotic fungi such as l. bicolor and tuber melanosporum have fewer cazymes  <cit> . the saprotrophic fungi have fewer cazymes than plant pathogenic fungi, especially lacking families involved in degrading living plant tissues, because they can obtain nutrients from plant residues. compared with obligate biotrophic plant pathogen and symbiotic fungi, necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic plant pathogens have relatively more cazymes  <cit> , because those fungi have relatively limited nutrients within plant tissue. the fungi with dual lifestyles as endophyte and pathogen have high diversity and number of cazymes because those fungi should adapt to endophytic lifestyle to utilize the limited intercellular nutrients from plant tissue. pectin is the major component between cells of the living plant tissues. the expansion of pectinase putative genes in p. fici genome provides more evidence for its endophytic lifestyle.

transporters involved in uptaking nutrients from plants have undergone significant expansion in bacterial endophytes  <cit> . the higher number of sp family genes in p. fici indicates an enhanced capacity for uptaking limited carbohydrates from plants. the expansion of tna <dig> clade belonging to acs family suggests that p. fici might be dependent from host for vitamin b <dig> supply. mfs transporters from dha <dig> family and dha <dig> family are able to export drugs to the environment  <cit> . consistent with abundant transporters from dha <dig> family and dha <dig> family, export of more metabolites facilitates that p. fici communicates with host plant.

fungi interact with other organisms and environment factors in their living niches. endophytic lifestyle is one of many factors that affect capacity of fungal secondary metabolites, and not all endophytes are rich in secondary metabolite production. compared with the endophytic ascocoryne sarcoides, epichloë festucae, and pi. indica, p. fici genome showed abundant secondary metabolites and a high diversity of core enzyme-encoding genes and gene clusters for secondary metabolites. however, the transcriptional profile indicated that only a few of these gene clusters are expressed under certain culture condition. although many gene clusters may be cryptic when p. fici is growing in vitro, the environment influences their secondary metabolites in planta considering the fact that endophytes reside within plants and are interacting with their hosts. the co-culture of an endophytic fungus with its host plant cells in vitro may enhance the production of fungal secondary metabolism and promote discovery of novel natural products.

the nrps/pks hybrids in dothideomycetes, eurotiomycetes, and sordariomycetes have been acquired from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer  in the relatively early evolution of the pezizomycotina  <cit> . our phylogenetic analyses of pks genes revealed the bacterial origination of four nrps/pks hybrids in p. fici genome via hgt. this result was also supported by the nrps/pks hybrid pfici_ <dig> which does not contain introns. however, another three hybrid genes pfici_ <dig>  pfici_ <dig>  and pfici_ <dig> contain seven, two, and eight introns, respectively. these results may be explained by the divergence time of those genes. appearance and evolution of introns in the genes acquired from bacteria remains unknown and need further investigation. in addition, a 6-msas gene  in p. fici was also apparently from bacterium via hgt. therefore, hgt could be one major approach for the diversity generating and maintaining of pks genes in p. fici.

the gene duplication is the second approach and may be more important than hgt for generating pks gene diversity in n. crassa  <cit> . genome analysis of p. fici revealed that four pairs of paralogous pks genes  may be generated by duplications. although high rip process in the p. fici genome may result in the lack of highly duplicated sequences, gene duplication has occurred before the emergence of rips. overall, the diversity of pkss in the p. fici genome may result from both gene duplication and hgt.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report on the genome sequencing, comparative genome analysis, and transcriptional analysis of secondary metabolite clusters in endophytic fungus p. fici of tea . the predicted gene clusters of secondary metabolism obviously enhance the identification of biosynthesis pathway of known compounds, and show the huge potential for drug discovery from natural products of p. fici. besides, the sequence data also offer a better understanding of life strategy of plant endophyte p. fici, namely that abundance of extracellular pectinase adapts to lifestyle of living tissue of plant and uses pectin as nutrient. the genome sequence will facilitate future studies into mining novel bioactive secondary metabolites of plant endophyte and plant-endophyte interactions.
