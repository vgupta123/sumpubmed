BACKGROUND
the silkworm, bombyx mori, is a holometabolous insect that has four distinct life stages including embryo, larva, pupa, and moth. it is a model organism for lepidoptera in molecular genetics and functional genomics and has greatly contributed to understanding of the mechanisms governing metamorphosis and diapause  <cit> . lepidoptera represent a diverse group of agricultural insect pests of food and fiber crops worldwide. hence, gaining a thorough understanding of gene function in lepidoptera is a critical step when developing new and targeted methods of pest control. the insect brain is a 'supraesophageal ganglion' which is interconnected by paired circumesophageal connectives with subesophageal ganglion <cit> . the insect brain is an important part of neurosecretory system. a large number of neuropeptide precursor genes have been characterized in insect brains  <cit> . as their major secreted molecules, neuropeptides play multiple functions. brain neuropeptides are mainly used for cell-to-cell communication by multicellular organisms and play essential roles in regulating the growth and development of insects  <cit> . in  <dig>  williams proved that the brain hormone  turns on the prothoracic glands which secrete a hormone directly responsible for stimulating the development of peripheral tissues  <cit> . a recent study showed that myosuppressin purified from pupal brains of b. mori functioned as a prothoracicostatic hormone and probably played an important role in controlling the development of silkworm  <cit> . additional evidence indicated that neuropeptides including corazonin, flrfamides, and myoinhibitory peptides  were involved in the orchestration of the ecdysis behavioral sequence  <cit> . research of targeted ablation of crustacean cardioactive peptide  neuropeptide-containing neurons found that ccap is also a key regulator of ecdysis and circadian regulation of drosophila  <cit> . one study also revealed that bombyx prothoracicostatic peptides whose gene transcripts were most prominent in brains of bombyx activate the sex peptide receptor expressed in the prothoracic gland to regulate ecdysteroid biosynthesis  <cit> . even single neuropeptide can be multifunctional and be expressed by different nerve cells at different stages. for instance, both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques showed that different cell types expressed ccap at specific developmental stages  <cit> . so studies related to the neuropeptide genes expression profiles in brains of silkworm will provide invaluable information. in our study, to provide new insights into activation of the ecdysis sequence during pupation and to better understand the regulating mechanisms during larval-to-pupal metamorphosis of silkworm, we investigated the gene expression profiles in the silkworm brain at selected stages v <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> which are critical to such biological processes.

the technology of microarray allows the monitoring of expression of hundreds to thousands of genes simultaneously  <cit> . importantly, this approach provides clues for elucidating the functions of genes underlying specific processes and identifying candidate genes predicted to regulate processes of interest. several researchers have used microarray to study the gene expression patterns of selected tissues and developmental stages of silkworm. a  <dig>  70-mer oligonucleotide microarray was designed and used to survey the gene expression in multiple silkworm tissues from mid-fifth instar larvae  <cit> . huang et al reported a genome-wide analysis of silkworm host response to pathogen bacillus bombyseptieus infection with microarrays  <cit> . using an oligonucleotide microarray containing  <dig>  probes, liang et al studied the gene expression patterns in epidermal cells of silkworm  <cit> . an oligonucleotide microarray containing  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes was used to analyze the global transcriptional profiles of host genes in bmnpv-infected silkworm cells  <cit> . recently a microarray system comprising  <dig>  oligonucleotide 70-mer probes was employed to compare differentially expressed genes in the midguts of bmcpv-infected and normal silkworm larvae  <cit> . however, the expression profiles of silkworm brains have not been reported yet.

this paper described the expression profiles of silkworm brains for the first time at v <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> stages. a total of  <dig>  genes were transcribed in at least one selected stage. the expression of several categories of genes encoding neuropeptide precursor, neuropeptide-like precursor , and cuticular protein was observed. these results provided useful information and expanded our knowledge of the gene expression patterns of silkworm brains.

RESULTS
developmental expression profiles of genes in silkworm brains
current oligonucleotide microarrays containing  <dig>  probes were used to investigate the developmental expression profiles of genes in brains at v <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  the complete sets of raw and normalized data from this study have been deposited in the gene expression omnibus  repository . based on the criterion of signal intensity more than  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  of genes were transcribed at v <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig>   genes were expressed in at least one selected stage.

clustering algorithms and treeview were used to analyze the expression profiles of these  <dig>  genes. from the heat map of hierarchical clustering, as shown in figure 1a, we found that two  of the selected  <dig> stages were clustered together, indicating that genes shared similar expression profiles in silkworm brains in these stages. k-means clustering was further performed , resulting in  <dig>  genes divided into four clusters. clusters i, ii, iii, and iv had  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes , respectively. genes in the four clusters showed distinctly different expression patterns. in cluster i, high levels of expression were observed in p <dig>  in clusters ii and iii, it was found that genes were more abundantly expressed in v <dig> and p <dig> than those in p <dig> and p <dig>  it is worthwhile to mention that genes in cluster iv were highly expressed in four stages. therefore, genes in cluster iv were considered as the stably expressed genes that is convenient for description.

stably expressed genes in silkworm brains along with development
genes whose expression was detected in silkworm brain were separated into two parts, stably expressed genes and variably expressed genes. automatic go analysis of molecule annotation system  was used to analyze the stably expressed genes. as shown in figure 2a, they were divided into three categories including molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. the molecular function category mainly consisted of five subcategories including catalytic, binding, structural molecule, hormone, and transporter activity. in the catalytic subcategory, a large number of genes encoding enzymes were expressed including helicase, hydrogen-transporting atp synthase, oxidoreductase, protein kinase, hydrolase, atpase, threonine- and serine-type endopeptidase, transferase, and ubiquitin-protein ligase. twenty-two neuropeptide genes were found in the subcategory of hormone activity. of these, eight bombyxin genes were detected. cuticular protein genes and ribosomal genes were predominant in the structural molecule subcategory. it should be noted that prior to this study the expression of  <dig> cuticular protein genes had not been detected.

using automatic analysis of kegg pathways in mas <dig> , we found  <dig>  stably expressed genes involved in  <dig> pathways including nine signaling pathways such as wnt, phosphatidylinositol, calcium, vascular endothelial growth factor , insulin, and transforming growth factor beta  signaling pathways. figure 2b also showed that a large number of expressed genes were involved in ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. the automatic go and kegg analysis of mas <dig>  for stably expressed genes was provided in additional file  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

variably expressed genes in silkworm brains along with development
of the  <dig>  genes expressed in brains at four stages,  <dig>  variably expressed genes were screened at a four-fold cut-off value. the ratio of more than  <dig> or less than  <dig>  represents up- and down- regulated expression, respectively. as shown in figure  <dig>  k-means clustering divided the  <dig>  genes into four clusters. genes in cluster i were highly expressed at v <dig>  whereas genes in cluster iii were highly expressed at p <dig>  genes in cluster ii were highly expressed in a pupal-biased manner but the expressions of genes in cluster iv were relatively repressed in pupal stages. in cluster i, eleven neuropeptide genes, one nplp gene, and one neurogenin related protein gene were found. genes encoding antennal binding protein, chemosensory related protein, and five cytochrome p450s were also detected. interestingly, some immune-related genes were detected including two immulectin genes and one immune-related hdd <dig> gene. in addition, the expressions of mbf <dig> gene, aquaporin gene, cuticular protein genes, time-ea <dig> gene, yellow protein gene, and wing disc-specific protein genes were observed in this cluster. in cluster ii, nine cuticular protein genes as well as the genes encoding carboxylesterase, chitin binding protein, lipase, silkworm trachealess, insulin-related peptide binding protein were identified. in cluster iii, the expressions of a pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  gene,  <dig> cuticular protein genes, and a atp-dependent rna helicase ddx <dig>  gene were detected. in cluster iv, a neuropeptide akh <dig> gene, a nplp gene, and two cuticular protein genes were transcribed. the homology blast results for  <dig>  variably expressed genes were provided in additional file  <dig> 

the expression profiles of neuropeptide genes in silkworm brains
based on the sequence homology and the structure conservation in the neuropeptides from other invertebrates,  <dig> putative neuropeptide genes rather than bombyxin genes were annotated by searching the silkworm genome and national center for biotechnology information  databases. the corresponding gene numbers were listed in additional file  <dig>  fifty-two oligonucleotide probes were designed for all silkworm putative neuropeptide genes including  <dig> bombyxin genes. three pairs of genes, namely, npf1a and npf1b genes, capaa and capab genes, and bombyxina- <dig> and a- <dig> genes shared the same probes because of the high sequence similarity. stringent quality threshold  clustering algorithm analysis was carried out to display the developmental expression profile of neuropeptide genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of  <dig> neuropeptide genes was detected. among them,  <dig> neuropeptide genes were expressed at all stages including short neuropeptide f , imfamide, neuropeptide f <dig> , sifamide, corazonin, bmk <dig>  and eight bombyxin genes with conservative motif of a, b, c, d, e, g subfamilies. genes for kinin, orcokinin, sulfakinin, eclosion hormone , allatropin, allatostatin-c, ccap, bombyxinb- <dig>  and bombyxinf- <dig> were expressed only at v <dig>  the pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  gene was expressed at a relatively higher level at p <dig>  the expression patterns of two genes, npf <dig> and growth-blocking peptide , were further confirmed by real-time pcr. as shown in figure 5a and 5b, the results of real-time pcr showed that their expression profiles were consistent with the results of the microarray.

the expression profiles of neuropeptide-like precursor genes in silkworm brains
neuropeptide like precursor  genes had been discovered in the central nervous system of drosophila melanogaster and sarcophaga crassipalpis  <cit> . six putative nplp <dig> genes were found in silkworm genome database by blast searches . of these, nplp4b has four copies. all the nplp <dig> proteins have three highly conserved amino acids yyx  at the c-terminal. the silkworm nplp <dig> genes are distributed in chromosomes  <dig> in a narrow region at the nscaf  <dig>  as shown in figure 6b.

six oligonucleotide probes were designed for these nplp <dig> genes. the result of qt clustering algorithm analysis showed that they had various expression patterns in silkworm brains . for example, the expression of nplp4c gene was repressed at p <dig>  whereas it expressed at a higher level at p <dig>  the real-time pcr data for this gene  showed a similar expression pattern.

the expression profiles of cuticular protein genes in silkworm brains
in the present microarray data, prominent among the brain-expressed genes were cuticular protein genes. the expressions of  <dig> cuticular protein genes were detected in silkworm brains. k-means clustering was performed , resulting in  <dig> cuticular protein genes divided into four clusters. cuticular protein genes in cluster i were highly expressed from p <dig> to p <dig>  the expressions of genes in cluster ii, iii, and iv were almost restricted to p <dig>  p <dig> and v <dig>  respectively. the results were also supported by the real-time pcr data .

in silkworm, cuticular protein genes are divided into six families including rr , tweedle, cpf, cpfl, cpg, and cph families based on conserved motifs  <cit> . to better understand the expression profiles of cuticular protein genes bearing particular motifs in the silkworm brains, the number of genes in each cluster and the distribution in different families were summarized . the cuticular protein genes belonging to rr, tweedle, cpfl, cpg, and cph families were exclusively expressed. but the expression of cpf gene was undetectable.

discussion
in the present study, we designed  <dig> additional oligonucleotide probes for previously unpredicted genes and monitored gene expression profiles of silkworm brains isolated from four developmental stages using the oligonucleotide microarray containing  <dig>  probes. the expression of  <dig>  genes was detected in these stages. it resulted in the first microarray-based gene expression profiles of a lepidopteran insect brain.

genes whose expressions were detected in silkworm brains were separated into two parts, stably expressed genes and variably expressed genes. of previously reported  <dig> b. mori house-keeping genes  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were transcribed in the category of our stably expressed genes. the remaining two house-keeping genes, mitochondrial citrate synthase precursor gene and neurofilament gene were classified to cluster iii and cluster i, respectively . the results of the go and kegg analysis of stably expressed genes showed that the ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were principal pathways, suggesting that metabolisms of protein were probably prominent in silkworm brains.

k-means clustering was carried out to study the expression patterns of  <dig>  variably expressed genes. the expressions of a neurogenin related protein gene, an antennal binding protein gene, and a chemosensory protein related gene were detected in cluster i. a mouse neurogenin related protein was once reported to function as a vertebrate neuronal determination factor analogous to those of the drosophila proneural genes  <cit> . antennal binding protein and chemosensory protein are responsible for sensory signaling and might be required for the correct recognition of some odors  <cit> . our analysis detected the expression of five cytochrome p <dig> genes in cluster i, none of which are silkworm halloween genes, which are involved in biosynthesis of 20-hydroxyecdysone  from cholesterol  <cit> . since the cytochrome p <dig> gene superfamily consists of  <dig> putative members  <cit> , the expression of these five cytochrome p <dig> genes in silkworm brain might provide clues for their functional study. the genes in cluster iii were highly expressed at p <dig> stage including a pban gene and a ddx <dig> gene. pban is secreted from the subesophageal ganglion and is required for pheromone synthesis  <cit> . along with pban peptide, a diapause hormone  and three additional fxpr/kl neuropeptides  were post-translationally processed from a polyprotein precursor well conserved in moths  <cit> . ddx <dig> proteins are putative rna helicases that function in all aspects of rna metabolism, including translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . in cluster iv, the reduced gene expression in pupal stage may be responsible for the decreased titer of molting hormone  <cit> .

the expression profiles for neuropeptide genes in silkworm brains revealed that there was no correlation between neuropeptide expression profile and conservative motif. for instance, eight bombyxin genes were expressed at all stages, and two bombyxin genes were only expressed at v <dig>  a time for initiation of pupation. bombyxin was purified from the heads of the male adult bombyx mori as a factor that stimulated the prothoracic glands  of samia cynthia ricini, but failed to stimulate the pgs of bombyx itself to synthesize and release ecdysteroid  <cit> . moreover, bombyxin neuropeptides were also involved in various biological processes in silkworm such as metabolism and growth  <cit> . another neuropeptide gene with highest expression level at v <dig> is ptth gene. ptth is necessary for the induction of larval-pupal metamorphosis and stimulates the pgs to synthesize and release ecdysteroids  <cit> . in our study the expression peak of ptth gene on v <dig> probably shows its ability to stimulate ecdysone biosynthesis, but whether it is same for two bombyxin genes will be further explored. besides two bombyxin genes and a ptth gene, many neuropeptide genes were highly expressed at v <dig> including the genes encoding eclosion hormone , ccap, kinin, orcokinin, sulfakinin, allatropin, and allatostatin-c, suggesting that in the face of impending pupation, these neuropeptide genes were abundantly expressed. previous studies have showed that eh, ccap, and ecdysis triggering hormone  probably coordinated the sequence of pre-ecdysis, ecdysis, and postecdysis behaviors  <cit> . corazonin, flrfamides, and mips were also involved in orchestration of ecdysis sequence  <cit> . our data will facilitate further exploration of the functions and the interaction of neuropeptides in ecdysis sequence. furthermore, our data clearly showed that some neuropeptide genes with opposing effects were expressed in a similar pattern in the silkworm brains, for example, ptth versus myosuppressin and allatropin versus allatostatin-c. in the pgs, ptth stimulates ecdysteroidogenesis whereas bommo-myosuppressin  inhibits the same process  <cit> . but bms was not the first reported inhibitor to ptth-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis, a prothoracicostatic peptide  characterized by hua et al. was proved to have such a function at both the spinning and feeding stages in the brain of silkworm  <cit> . bms and ptsp regulated the pgs activity via different receptors, and bms had a higher prothoracicostatic activity on larval pgs than ptsp  <cit> . according to our data, the expression of bms at v <dig> is more abundant than that of ptsp.

nplp genes were first identified by analysis of the peptidome of the d. melanogaster larval central nervous system  <cit> . however until now, none of nplps had a function assigned to them except that the expression of nplp <dig> in the brain and ventral nerve cord of d. melanogaster was observed  <cit> . in addition, s. crassipalpis nplp <dig> was uniquely expressed during diapause which suggested its potential role in diapause initiation and maintenance  <cit> . in the silkworm genome database, the putative nplp <dig> and nplp <dig> genes were found by homology search. according to the present microarray data, the expressions of six nplp <dig> genes were detected in silkworm brains. est evidence has shown that nplp4e was present in epidermis, ovary and prothoracic gland of silkworm . liang et al. also reported that several nplps, which correspond to the nplp4b, nplp4e, and nplp4f in our study, were highly expressed in epidermal tissues of silkworm when molting was initiated  <cit> . all these results indicated that the expression of nplp <dig> genes was not tissue-specific. the diverse expression patterns of these nplp <dig> genes in the different tissues of silkworm implied they may function in various physiological processes.

cuticular proteins are usually considered as major components of the insect cuticle. but in our study, a large number of cuticular protein genes were expressed in brains of silkworm at p <dig> and p <dig>  the observed expression of cuticular protein genes in brains was not a surprise since their est data had been identified in multiple internal organs such as ovary, brain, and posterior silk gland  <cit> .

our data revealed massive expression of a majority of cuticular protein genes at pupal stages, especially at p <dig> and p <dig>  a reasonable explanation for this observation is that these cuticular protein genes were transcribed and immediately translated to proteins participating in the morphologic and synaptic reorganization of brains acquiring new features as required by development  <cit> . the morphologic images of brains at four stages were provided in additional file  <dig>  the silkworm brain is composed of an optical lobe , antennal lobe , and central brain   <cit> . during metamorphosis, pronounced developmental alterations of the morphology of all these were observed in manduca sexta  <cit> . our data indicated that the reorganization of silkworm brain is very active at pupal stages. in addition, our data clearly showed no correlation between the expression profiles of cuticular protein genes and the presence of conserved motifs. this result is consistent with what was found in the expression profiles of cuticular proteins in silkworm epidermal tissues  <cit> . this led us to suspect that different cuticular protein genes were recruited to build the complex structures of silkworm brains.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, we have surveyed gene expression profiles in silkworm brains at v <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> by means of a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray. based on our microarray data, a total of  <dig>  genes were activated, among those,  <dig> % genes didn't change expression acutely during tested stages, which mainly were involved in protein metabolism. manual screening of  <dig>  variably expressed genes revealed different expression profiles reflecting intense stage-specific characteristics. thirty-two neuropeptide genes, six neuropeptide-like precursor genes and  <dig> cuticular protein genes were expressed in selected developmental stages, displaying diverse expression patterns. this dataset will provide some important clues and novel insights for further research.
