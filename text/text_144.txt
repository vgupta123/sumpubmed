BACKGROUND
celiac disease  is a disorder that is characterized by a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins from wheat, rye, and barley. over  <dig> % of the western population suffers from cd, which presents itself by chronic diarrhea, fatigue, osteoporosis, lymphoma, and several other clinical symptoms after prolonged gluten consumption. until now, the only treatment is a complete and life long elimination of gluten from the daily diet  <cit> . in the small intestine, several native gluten peptides can bind directly to specific human leukocyte antigen -dq <dig> or dq <dig> receptors on antigen presenting cells . however, after deamidation by tissue transglutaminase , the affinity of the peptides for these hla-receptors is strongly increased. the gluten peptides can be presented by apcs to gluten-sensitive t-cell lymphocytes leading to the release of cytokines, which will cause inflammation reactions and result in damaged intestinal villi  <cit> .

gluten are major storage proteins and have many interesting characteristics for food industrial applications, e.g. in baking bread. gluten proteins can be divided into three main groups: high molecular weight glutenin subunits , low molecular weight glutenin subunits , and gliadins. the hmw-gs are divided in x-type and y-type subunits  <cit> . the lmw-gs are divided into b-, c-, and d-type subunits  <cit> . gliadins are divided into α/β-, γ-, and ω-gliadins  <cit> . multiple t-cell activating gluten peptides were mainly found in α-gliadins, but also in γ-gliadins and both lmw-gs and hmw-gs  <cit> . especially peptides derived from α-gliadins are recognized by t-cells from most cd patients, while t-cell responses to γ-gliadins and glutenins are less frequently found  <cit> .

wheat varieties with very low amounts of t-cell stimulatory epitopes may be tolerated by many cd-patients  <cit> , while a diet based on wheat varieties reduced in t-cell stimulatory epitopes may help in the prevention of cd, as it has been observed that the amount and duration to gluten exposure is associated with the initiation of cd  <cit> . breeding for bread wheat  with less t-cell stimulatory gluten may result, however, in varieties with unwanted loss of technological properties, because glutenins and gliadins together contribute largely to dough quality. a correct mixture of both glutenins and gliadins is essential to obtain optimal viscoelastic dough  <cit> , and the quantity and the size distribution of the gluten proteins are important factors for polymerization  <cit> .

gluten-encoding genes are located on the three homoeologous genomes of bread wheat: a, b, and d. a few  to a hundred  gene copies are present in hexaploid wheat. sequences of individual gene copies within the same gluten family, such as the α-gliadins, are very similar and may contain multiple and different t-cell stimulatory epitopes  <cit> . gluten proteins are encoded by  <dig> major loci. the hmw-gs are encoded by loci on the long arm of group  <dig> chromosomes   <cit> . the lmw-gs are mainly encoded by the glu- <dig> loci on the short arms of group  <dig> chromosomes   <cit>  and are tightly linked to the loci encoding the γ-gliadins and ω-gliadins . most α/β-gliadins are encoded by loci on the short arms of group  <dig> chromosomes   <cit> .

in this study, deletion lines of triticum aestivum cv. chinese spring  were selected  <cit> . these deletion lines are generally lacking one locus containing gluten genes from one of the three homoeologous chromosomes. here, we explore the feasibility to reduce t-cell stimulatory epitopes in hexaploid bread wheat by screening with epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies  <cit> , while maintaining the technological properties.

RESULTS
protein database search
the ncbi protein database search was performed to analyze the number of proteins that contain the different sequences recognized by mab and t-cells. this search provided insight in how many proteins were expected to contain the different sequences and which different sequences were present within the proteins. the numbers of protein sequences that contain the various sequences involved in the onset of cd that are recognized by t-cells and mabs are shown in table  <dig>  it was observed that the mab and t-cell minimal sequences were specific for the epitopes in each of the expected protein group, with the exception of the mab recognizing glia-α <dig>  whose minimally recognized sequence was also present in a number of γ- and ω-gliadin proteins. the sequence recognized by the t-cells was not present within any other protein group except for the α/β-gliadins. the minimal sequences recognized by mabs lmw- <dig> and lmw- <dig> were more frequently found in the lmw-gs group than the sequence recognized by the corresponding t-cells. the sequences recognized by mab and t-cells for hmw-glt was present in nearly all hmw-gs protein sequences.

the number in each cell represents the presence of the recognized sequence by mab or t-cell within a protein group. '-' in a cell means that the sequence was not present.

sds-page
to obtain the gluten protein patterns from the cs deletion lines, gluten proteins were extracted and analyzed by sds-page followed by silver staining. major differences compared to cs wild type are indicated by boxes in figure  <dig>  differences in gluten protein content compared to cs wild type were mostly observed in the b-, c- type lmw-gs and α/β-, γ-gliadin region. lines with deletions of the short arms of chromosomes 1d were missing several gluten protein bands in the ω-gliadin/d-type lmw-gs region. the double deletion line, 1bs-19/6ds- <dig> , was missing the largest number of gluten protein bands because of two deletions in gluten encoding regions. unexpected results were obtained for deletion line 1bs- <dig>  which is the line with the smallest deletion of chromosome arm 1bs. this line is missing an extra band compared to the other 1bs deletion lines having larger deletions. this does not fit with reported results on deletion lines  <cit> . deletion line 6bs- <dig>  missed a gluten protein band that is present in the other deletion lines of chromosome 6b, even though deletion line 6bs- <dig> has been reported  to contain a larger deletion than 6bs- <dig>  deletion line 6bs- <dig> also contains the 5bs- <dig> deletion, but, to our knowledge, no gluten protein locus has ever been identified onto the short arm of chromosome 5b. we do not have any explanation for these discrepancies

gli- <dig> deletions
cs deletion lines were analyzed for their contribution to t-cell stimulatory epitopes by using various mabs recognizing different t-cell epitopes. in figure 2a, immunoblot results are presented using mabs glia-α <dig> and glia-α <dig> for deletion lines of the short arm of chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . major differences, compared to cs wild type, are indicated with arrowheads. deletion lines 1as- <dig> and 1as- <dig> were missing one gluten protein band by using mab glia-α <dig> and no gluten protein bands by using mab glia-α <dig> . this suggests that this missing gluten protein only contains the epitope sequence recognized by mab glia-α <dig> and the loci encoding these gluten protein map to bin 1as3- <dig> – <dig>   . all five deletion lines of the short arm of chromosome 1b  lacked one gluten protein band by using mab glia-α <dig> and no gluten protein band by using mab glia-α <dig>  the double deletion line 1bs-19/6ds- <dig>  was missing two extra bands using mab glia-α <dig> and four by using mab glia-α <dig>  which is caused by the 6ds- <dig> deletion. two gluten protein bands were recognized by both mabs glia-α <dig> and glia-α <dig>  all 1bs deletion lines  lacked the same gluten protein band recognized by mab glia-α <dig> and because of that the loci encoding corresponding gluten protein map to bin 1bssat18- <dig> – <dig>  . all three deletion lines of the short arm of chromosome 1d  lacked four gluten protein bands by using mab glia-α <dig> and two gluten protein bands by using mab glia-α <dig>  these missing protein bands correspond to the boxed  proteins in figure  <dig>  one gluten protein band did not completely disappear by using mab glia-α <dig>  this is probably because of the presence of gluten proteins from different loci but having the same molecular weights, therefore becoming visible only as one gluten protein band. the loci encoding the recognized gluten proteins map to bin 1ds5- <dig> – <dig>   . the two gluten protein bands recognized by mab glia-α <dig> were the same as recognized by mab glia-α <dig> 

gli- <dig> deletions
when analyzing cs deletion lines that are lacking parts of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  deletion line 6as- <dig>  lacked one gluten protein band in immunoblotting using mab glia-α <dig> and two bands by using mab glia-α <dig>  deletion line 6bs- <dig>  lacked one gluten protein band by using mab glia-α <dig>  but this was not the case for the other two 6bs deletion lines, 6bs- <dig> and 6bs- <dig> , which is not consistent with the reported sizes of the deletions. in the 6bs deletion lines, no changes were observed in gluten protein bands compared with cs wild type by using mab glia-α <dig> . these results suggest that the short arm of chromosome 6b encodes no gluten proteins containing t-cell stimulatory epitopes recognized by both mabs glia-α <dig> and glia-α <dig>  at least not mapping to bin 6bs- <dig> – <dig>   . deletion line 6ds- <dig>  the line with the largest deletion  lacked two gluten protein bands recognized by mab glia-α <dig> and four bands by mab glia-α <dig>  one gluten protein band has not completely disappeared probably because of the presence of different gluten proteins having the same molecular weight within one gluten protein band. the same gluten protein bands are also absent in the double deletion line 1bs-19/6ds- <dig> . these missing protein bands correspond to the boxed  proteins in figure  <dig>  hence, the loci encoding these gluten proteins map to bin 6ds4- <dig> – <dig>  .

glu- <dig> deletions
the immunoblot results using mab lmw- <dig> for the deletion lines of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  one band was observed in all the deletion lines and in cs wild type without significant differences. immunoblot results using mab lmw- <dig> showed similar patterns .

glu- <dig> deletions
within the protein database, nearly all hmw-gs had epitope sequences recognized by mab hmw-glt. the immunoblot results for the deletion lines of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> using the mab recognizing hmw-glt are shown in figure 4a. in cs wild type, all four hmw glutenin subunits were detected. no contribution to hmw-gs was observed for the long arm of chromosome 1a, as expected for a transcriptional silent locus. two hmw-gs, 1bx <dig> and 1by <dig>  were absent in deletion lines 1bl- <dig> and 1bl- <dig>  this suggests that the locus encoding hmw-gs 1bx <dig> and 1by <dig> map to bin 1bl1- <dig> – <dig>  . the two hmw-gs, 1dx <dig> and 1dy <dig>  were absent in deletion line 1dl- <dig>  this suggests that the loci encoding hmw-gs 1dx <dig> and 1dy <dig> map to bin 1dl4- <dig> – <dig>  .

rheological parameters of chinese spring deletion lines
the lines with the largest deletions from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  according to our results, were used for technological testing. parameters among flours of different deletion lines are presented in figure  <dig> and in the additional file 1: rheological parameters.

total protein content in flour  of all deletion lines was higher compared to cs wild type flour. especially protein content in flour of line 6as- <dig> was high , followed by protein content in flour of deletion line 1bs-19/6ds- <dig> .

the glutenin macro polymer  content expressed as volume per mg protein was decreased in deletion line 1bl- <dig> and was nil in deletion line 1dl- <dig> . gmp represents the highly aggregated glutenin protein network that is the prime determinant of dough elastic properties. a decrease in gmp is therefore expected to lead to a decrease in dough strength  <cit> . because of the low amount of gmp present in flour of the deletion lines 1bl- <dig> and 1dl- <dig>  it was impossible to estimate glutenin particle sizes for these lines. flours of the two deletion lines, 1bs- <dig> and 6ds- <dig>  showed a small decrease in gmp volume. for all other deletion lines, the gmp volume was increased.

glutenin particle size is a predictor of dough mixing properties  <cit> . average glutenin particle size was increased in flours of deletion line 1al- <dig> and 6as- <dig>  in deletion lines 6ds- <dig>  6bs- <dig>  1bs- <dig>  1bs-19/6ds- <dig> and 1as- <dig> the average particle size was decreased compared to cs wild type.

dough made from flours of the two deletion lines 1bl- <dig> and 1dl- <dig>  lacking hmw-gs, showed a significant decrease in dough development time  . dough made from all other deletion lines showed increase in ddt, especially the lines with deletions of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and 1as- <dig>  deletions of the gli- <dig> loci seem to have a substantial effect on increasing ddt.

bandwidth at peak resistance  is a measure of dough stability. the bwpr was slightly decreased for deletion line 1dl- <dig> and was increased for all other deletion lines compared to cs wild type dough . the bwpr was especially high for deletion lines 6as- <dig> and 1bs-19/6ds- <dig>  it is relevant to note that these are the same deletion lines having the highest protein content in flour.

dough elasticity, indicated by relaxation half time , was decreased in flours of deletion lines 1bl- <dig> and 1dl- <dig>  which lack hmw-gs, and in deletion lines 6bs- <dig> and 6ds- <dig> . in contrast, deletion lines 1bs-19/6ds- <dig> and 1as- <dig>  showed an increase in t1/ <dig>  indicating more elastic dough  <cit> .

to summarize, in figure  <dig> immunoblots are shown for chinese spring wild type and the gliadin proteins reacting with mabs glia-α <dig> and glia-α <dig> are numbered. in table  <dig> the relation is shown of these proteins together with their bin-location on the chromosomes and the rheological parameters if these proteins are missing in the deletion lines. deletions of the long arms of chromosome 1a, 1b, and 1d are not included because the hmw-gs encoded by the loci on these arms  seem to be required for good technological properties.

protein bands are numbered as shown in figure  <dig> and their bin location is determined. bin location is linked to rheological parameters. results are compared to chinese spring, which is set at "0". "+" in cell means value is up to 50% higher. "++" in cell means value is between  <dig> to100% higher. "-" in cell means values is up to 50% lower. "--" in cell means value is between  <dig> to100% lower. "yes" or "no" in cell means the reaction with the mab.

discussion
in this study, we examined the possibilities to develop a bread wheat variety with both reduced levels of t-cell stimulatory epitopes and good technological properties. we used a set of chinese spring deletion lines that lack different gluten protein-encoding loci from the group  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes to determine whether reduction in t-cell stimulatory epitopes can be achieved by removal of certain gluten protein encoding genes with minimal effect on the technological properties of bread wheat. many cytogenetic resources have been developed in t. aestivum cv chinese spring, which is considered as a model variety for hexaploid wheat. however, differences among varieties may exist.

cd immunogenic epitopes
on the short arm of the group  <dig> chromosomes, the gluten loci that encode α-gliadins are located. the α-gliadins are considered the most immunogenic concerning both the adaptive immune response and the innate immune response  <cit> . we observed that the locus on the short arm of chromosome 6d, mapped to bin 6ds- <dig> – <dig> , is responsible for most of the t-cell stimulatory α-gliadin proteins. these results are in agreement with the results obtained by molberg et al.  <cit>  who showed no decrease in response of dq2-α-ii t-cells for deletion line 6ds- <dig> and a significant decrease in t-cell response for deletion lines 6ds- <dig> and 6ds- <dig>  in addition, results are in agreement with results of van herpen et al.  <cit> , based on relative presence of cd-epitopes in α-gliadin ests from the three homoeologous loci, and with results of salentijn et al.  <cit>  on the presence in cdnas from two hexaploid and two tetraploid cultivars. when using mab glia-α <dig> in immunoblotting also two gluten protein bands were stained that were encoded by the short arm of chromosome 1d. we tentatively assign these as ω-gliadins/d-type lmw-gs containing the mab glia-α <dig> sequence. only a few ω-gliadin proteins have been sequenced so far because they are difficult to clone due to the presence of large repetitive domains  <cit> . it has been shown that ω-gliadins may have epitopes that are involved in gluten-sensitive response of cd patients  <cit> . the α-gliadins encoded by chromosome  <dig> seem to be related to gliadins encoded by chromosome  <dig> from which they might have originated through gene duplication and/or translocation  <cit> . analysis of the minimal sequence recognized by mab glia-α <dig> indicated that this sequence also occurs in some γ- and ω-gliadins. indeed, mab glia-α <dig> recognized gluten protein bands that disappeared in deletion lines of the short arm of chromosome 1a, 1b, and 1d . we observed that genes mapped to bin 1ds- <dig> – <dig>  had the highest contribution to the number of t-cell stimulatory epitopes.

technological properties
studies have shown that the technological parameters of wheat flours are influenced by alleles encoding different hmw-gs  <cit> , lmw-gs  <cit> , and gliadins  <cit> .

deleting parts of the short arm of chromosome 1a resulted in an increased dough development time  and volume of glutenin macro polymer . a decrease in lmw-gs or gliadins results in a relative increase of ratios for hmw-gs/lmw-gs or glutenins/gliadins. such a change was suggested to increase dough strength  <cit> . indeed, we found that removal of the locus from the short arm of chromosome 1a resulted in increased dough elasticity. in the deletion lines 1as- <dig> and 1ds- <dig>  higher gmp volumes were observed, while in deletion line 1bs- <dig> a decreased gmp volume was found together with decreased ddt. on chromosome 1b, also a glu-b <dig> locus is located encoding a b-type lmw-gs  <cit>  and a glu-b <dig> locus is located encoding two tightly linked genes for an ω-gliadin and a b-type lmw-gs  <cit> . this suggests that lmw-gs encoded by these loci are important for the formation of the gmp  <cit> . removal of the loci could affect the ratios for hmw-gs/lmw-gs or glutenins/gliadins. chromosome 1d encodes a d-type lmw-gs containing a single cysteine residue and therefore may act as a chain terminator  <cit> . the absence of the protein could increase the gmp volume in deletion line 1ds- <dig>  it would be expected that the gmp volume would decrease in deletion line 1as- <dig> because of removal of the locus encoding major lmw-gs. we observed, however, that no t-cell stimulatory epitopes present in lmw-gs disappeared from the immunoblot using mabs lmw- <dig> and lmw- <dig>  which is possible if expression from the deleted locus is compensated for by the other two loci present on the homoeologous chromosomes, for example by a higher expression of glu-b <dig>  compensation behavior of storage protein synthesis in wheat was observed by wieser et al.  <cit>  after inhibition of the expression of α-gliadins by rna interference . also gil-humanes et al.  <cit>  recently observed while rnai reduced the proportion of γ-gliadins by 55–80% and α-gliadins by 63%, this did not lead to similar reduction in proteins detected by the sandwich elisa using the r <dig> monoclonal antibody. the r <dig> assay was, however, developed for the detection of gluten proteins from different sources and not optimized to detect t-cell stimulatory gluten proteins  <cit> . hence, although the r <dig> assay is currently considered the standard test for identification of gluten contaminants, we regarded this test unsuitable in the context of this study.

with respect to technological properties, deletion line 6as- <dig> showed an increase in gmp volume and a strong increase in glutenin particle size. in contrast, deletion lines 6bs- <dig> and 6ds- <dig> showed a decrease in glutenin particle size and a decrease in gmp volume for deletion line 6ds- <dig>  gliadins of the α- and γ-type have been identified to contain an extra cysteine residue that makes them act as chain terminators. we suggest that the short arm of chromosome 6a in cs is encoding a chain terminating α-gliadin. the lower content of chain terminators could account for a larger size of glutenin particles as observed in deletion line 6as- <dig>  because of compensation, deletions of the short arm of chromosome 6b and 6d could lead to an increased expression of chain terminating α-gliadins encoded by the short arm of chromosome 6a and result in observed smaller glutenin particle sizes. the deletions of the short arm of chromosome 6b and 6d resulted in stronger dough as shown by increased ddt. this effect on dough strength is expected because a decrease in α-gliadins results in a relative increase of the glutenin/gliadin ratio. the gmp volume of flour from deletion line 6ds- <dig> was decreased, which indicates weaker dough, whereas the ddt was increased, which indicates stronger dough. because of this effect, the decrease in gmp volume in deletion line 6ds- <dig> resulted in decreased elasticity rather than decreased dough strength.

we observed that technological properties of flour from deletion lines were strongly affected by the removal of the different hmw-gs with the strongest effect in deletion line 1dl- <dig>  dough strength  and dough elasticity  were both strongly decreased, which is in agreement with published results  <cit> . deletion of the locus on the long arm of chromosome 1a resulted in some increase in dough strength  and elasticity . in addition, glutenin particle sizes were significantly increased. both the x-type and y-type encoding genes of cs at glu-a <dig> are silent  <cit> . in most studies, the silent locus at glu-a <dig> was not found to be important to determine dough strength compared to non-silent loci  <cit> , so the effect of deletion of the long arm of chromosome 1al might be because of the absence of other gene products. based on these results, the glu- <dig> loci of cs are considered inappropriate as a focus to breed for wheat with less t-cell stimulatory epitopes if technological properties are to be preserved.

CONCLUSIONS
a strategy to breed for bread wheat with less t-cell stimulatory gluten epitopes while retaining technological properties is feasible by focusing on eliminating genes present on the short arms of chromosome 1d and 6d. this will result in a wheat variety with highly decreased t-cell stimulatory epitopes. however, eliminating genes might decrease dough elasticity because of a changed ratio in glutenin and gliadin proteins. this ratio could be compensated for by the addition of monomeric proteins with no t-cell stimulatory to the flour, for example from safe sources like oats, or by the introduction through breeding or genetic modification of cd-safe gliadin genes. in addition, wheat varieties with limited but not complete reduced levels of t-cell stimulatory epitopes may still contribute to lower the gluten load for the entire population and it may reduce the development of cd in a number of potential patients.
