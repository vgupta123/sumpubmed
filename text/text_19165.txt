BACKGROUND
temperature is one of the pivotal factors influencing plant growth and development. both yield and quality are reduced when the temperature is above or below optimal levels  <cit> . the ipcc  forecasts that the extreme annual daily maximum temperature  will likely increase by about 1-3°c by mid-twenty-first century and by about 2-5°c by the late twenty-first centry , and direct grape yield losses in the range of  <dig> -16% for every 1°c increase in seasonal temperatures have been observed  <cit> . therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in thermotolerance would be greatly significant and would lay the theoretical foundation for formulating the strategies of adaptation to high temperatures.

direct injuries associated with high temperatures include protein denaturation, aggregation, and increased fluidity of membrane lipids. indirect or slower heat injuries include inactivation of enzymes in chloroplasts and mitochondria, inhibition of protein synthesis, protein degradation and loss of membrane integrity  <cit> . photosynthesis is a very sensitive process to heat stress. the inhibition of photosystem  ii leads to a change in variable chlorophyll a fluorescence, and in vivo chlorophyll may be used to detect changes in the photosynthetic apparatus, for example, with an o-j-i-p test  <cit> . heat stress also affects the organization of microtubules by splitting and/or elongating the spindles, forming microtubule asters in mitotic cells, and elongating the phragmoplast microtubules  <cit> . these injuries eventually lead to starvation, inhibition of growth, reduced ion flux, and the production of toxic compounds and reactive oxygen species   <cit> . to counter the effects of heat stress on cellular metabolism, plants and other organisms respond to temperature changes by reprogramming their transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and lipidome; that is, by altering their composition of certain transcripts, proteins, metabolites and lipids. such changes are aimed at establishing a new steady-state balance of metabolic processes that can enable the organism to function, survive and even reproduce at a higher temperature  <cit> . in general, most of the previous studies about heat stress focused on physiological or transcriptomic approaches. as protein metabolic processes, including synthesis and degradation, are most sensitive to heat stress, proteomics research on heat stress could have a large impact on the understanding of its consequences.

proteomics became popular in the 1990s and has greatly evolved to a mature stage today. the most frequently used proteomic technique is the two-dimensional  gel technique, where differentially expressed spots are excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry . proteomic responses to heat stress have been widely studied in many species, including rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , barley  <cit> , populus euphratica <cit> , norway spruce  <cit> , bitter gourd  <cit> . however, not all types of proteins are amenable to gel-based electrophoresis and the dynamic range is somewhat limited  <cit> . additionally, the co-migration and partial co-migration of proteins can compromise the accuracy of the quantification, and interfere with protein identification  <cit> . in recent years, a new technique termed itraq  has been applied for proteomic quantitation. itraq labeling overcomes some of the limitations of 2d-gel-based techniques, and also improves the throughput of proteomic studies. this technique has a high degree of sensitivity, and the amine specific isobaric reagents of itraq allow the identification and quantitation of up to eight different samples simultaneously  <cit> .

grapevines are widely cultivated fruit vines around the world, and are mainly used for juice, liquor and wine production  <cit> . heat stress is known to retard the growth and development of grapes, resulting in the decline of the yield and quality of the berry  <cit> . similar to other plants, the previous studies on the response of grapevines to high temperatures have mainly focused on physiological changes including photosynthesis, respiration, cell membrane stability, hormone changes and antioxidant systems  <cit> . however, the underlying mechanisms of heat stress are still unclear. transcriptomic analysis of grape  leaves was conducted using the affymetrix grape genome oligonucleotide microarray  under heat stress and subsequently recovery  <cit> . the effect of heat stress and recovery on grape appears to be associated with multiple processes and mechanisms including stress-related genes, transcription factors, and metabolism  <cit> . however, the transcription patterns are not always directly concomitant with protein expression levels  <cit> , and there are currently no reports on proteomic analyses in grapevines under heat stress. there have been, however, several reports of proteomic analyses of grapes . in order to understand the berry development and ripening process, martı’nez-esteso et al.  correlated the proteomic profiles with the biochemical and physiological change occurring in grapes. they identified and quantified  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed proteins in green and ripening phases, respectively, through a top-down proteomic approach based on difference gel electrophoresis  followed by tandem mass spectrometry   <cit> . basha et al. used the 2d-page to identify unique xylem sap proteins in vitis species with pierce’s disease , a destructive bacterial disease of grapes caused by xylella fastidiosa <cit> . martı’nez-esteso et al.  also identified  <dig> unique proteins in developing berries using the itraq labeling technique, with quantification of  <dig> proteins  <cit> . therefore, although there are many reports on the proteome of grapes, most have focused on fruit development  <cit>  and fruit disease  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, there are only a few grape proteomic studies which have addressed grapevine responses to abiotic stresses, including water or salt stress  <cit> . none of these studies have yet addressed heat stress of grape leaves. moreover, although the responses of some plants to stress are generally well-studied, relatively few studies have focused on the mechanisms associated with recovery after stress  <cit> . this recovery process from heat stress in plants is very important to survival, and the degree of recovery from stress is a direct index of plant thermotolerance  <cit> . as, there are potentially differences between the recovery and the direct heat response mechanisms in plants  <cit> , a proteomic evaluation and comparison of these processes is warranted.

in this study, we used the itraq labeling technique to assess proteome changes in 'cabernet sauvignon’ leaves of v. vinifera under heat stress and their subsequent recovery, in order to better understand the thermotolerance mechanism in grapevines.

RESULTS
thermostability of cell membranes in grapevine leaves under heat stress and subsequent recovery
the present study investigated changes in the cell membrane thermostability of 'cabernet sauvignon’ grapevine leaves under heat stress and subsequent recovery. we used the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances  concentrations as an indicator of the peroxidation and destruction of lipids with subsequent membrane damage  <cit> . one-way anova analysis showed that heat treatment  significantly increased the tbars concentrations in grape leaves , indicating the occurrence of damage to the cell membrane in the grapevine leaves under the heat treatment. after subsequent recovery, there was no difference in tbars concentrations between heat-treated and control leaves .

changes in the electron transport chain of psii under heat stress and subsequent recovery
the o-j-i-p test was used to investigate changes in the electron transport chain of psii. it has been shown that heat stress can induce a rapid rise in the o-j-i-p test. this phase, occurring at around 300 μs and labeled as k, is caused by an inhibition of the oxygen evolution complex . the amplitude of step k  can therefore be used as a specific indicator of damage to the psii donor site  <cit> . in addition, rcqa indicates the density of the active section of qa-reducing psii reaction centers. in the present study, compared with the control , heat stress resulted in an elevated wk and a lowered rcqa value . after recovery, wk declined and rcqa ascended to the control levels. figure 2c, d, e demonstrates the changes in maximum quantum yield for primary photochemistry , the quantum yield for electron transport , the probability that a trapped excitation moves an electron into the electron transport chain beyond qa-  in grape leaves during high temperature stress and recovery, respectively. φpo, φeo, ψeo decreased in grape leaves under heat stress, and went back to the control levels after recovery. δro signifies the redox state of photosystem i , i.e., the efficiency with which an electron transfers from plastoquinone  through ps i to reduce the ps i end electron acceptors. the δro value at 43°c rose significantly. however, these parameters returned to control levels after recovery .

protein response to heat stress and/or recovery in grape leaves revealed by itraq analysis
two hundred and seventy-four proteins were quantified with at least one significant peptide sequence and  <dig> of these characterized proteins were differentially expressed, i.e. an expression ratio >  <dig>  or <  <dig>   <cit>  under heat stress or recovery compared to their corresponding controls. heat stress and recovery affected protein expression levels in various ways. during heat stress,  <dig> proteins were upregulated, and  <dig> were downregulated, while  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated after recovery, compared to their corresponding control levels. there were  <dig>  proteins and  <dig>  proteins responding to only heat stress or recovery, respectively, while  <dig> proteins were differentially expressed in both heat stress and recovery. among these  <dig> proteins, eight proteins were upregulated both under heat stress and recovery, while nine proteins showed an opposing trend under the two conditions. seventeen proteins were upregulated under heat stress and downregulated during recovery, while eight proteins were downregulated under heat stress but upregulated during recovery. in addition, six upregulated proteins and two downregulated proteins were only identified under recovery from heat stress .

functional classification, subcellular localization and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins under heat stress and subsequent recovery
among the  <dig> differentially expressed proteins,  <dig> were characterized as hypothetical or unknown proteins under the grape genomics information category in uniprot . to gain functional information about these proteins, blastp  was used to search for homologous proteins against the ncbi non redundant  protein database. blast searching was able to align  <dig> of the unknown proteins . among these aligned proteins,  <dig> % had an e-value of less than  <dig> e- <dig> and showed very strong homology while the remaining  <dig> % had an e-value of between  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  the identities distribution defined  <dig> % of these aligned proteins as having a matched identity greater than 90%,  <dig> % between 60% and 90% and only one protein  lower than 60%. these results indicating that the unknown proteins might have similar function with the aligned proteins respectively. these differentially expressed proteins were classified into  <dig> functional categories according to mapman ontology as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the main categories included photosynthesis, proteins and stress. in addition, enrichment analysis against agrigo  showed that differentially expressed proteins were mainly enrich in response to abiotic stimulus , generation of precursor metabolites and energy  and photosynthesis  of biological process. moreover, subcellular localization of the  <dig> characterized proteins showed that  <dig> proteins  were located in chloroplast, five proteins  were assigned to the mitochondria,  <dig> proteins  belonged to secretory pathway, and  <dig> proteins  were classified as belonging to other locations. unfortunately,  <dig> of the differentially-expressed proteins had unknown locations . these results indicated that quite a lot of chloroplast proteins are related to thermotolerance of grapevine.

comparative analysis of common responsive proteins between heat stress and subsequent recovery
there were  <dig> proteins that were upregulated by heat stress, but were then downregulated after recovery . three of these proteins were categorized as being related to photosynthesis, including psi reaction center subunit n , atp synthase subunit beta , and rubisco large chain. interestingly, psan was upregulated  <dig> fold by heat stress but then downregulated more than  <dig> fold after recovery, compared with their corresponding controls. in addition, two of the proteins were related to metabolism: one is acetoacetyl-coa thiolase, which condenses two molecules of acetyl-coa to give acetoacetyl-coa, and this is the first enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids via mevalonate, the other is coproporphyrinogen-iii oxidase , a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of chlorophyll. universal stress protein , a transcription factor in abiotic stress, and thylakoidal ascorbate peroxidase , involved in h2o <dig> detoxification, were also induced by heat stress and decreased after subsequent recovery. moreover, proteins related to protein metabolism included one chloroplastic large subunit ribosomal protein  and one translation initiation factor . peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase and two transporters, the nascent polypeptide associated complex alpha and the mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit tim <dig> were also affected. one14-3-3-like protein, associated with a dna binding complex that binds to the g-box was also identified.

only eight proteins were upregulated by both heat stress and subsequent recovery . one psii subunit r , one psi subunit h  and a rubisco small submit were induced after heat stress and recovery. additionally, two ribosomal proteins  were also identified. moreover, heat shock protein   <dig> in chloroplast was induced  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold respectively by heat stress and recovery. nucleoside diphosphate kinase  <dig> , involved in purine metabolism, was also induced more than  <dig> fold under heat stress, and returned to almost the control level after recovery.

eight proteins were downregulated by heat stress but upregulated after subsequent recovery . among the eight proteins, two of them are related to photosynthesis, psi subunit l , psii protein d <dig> . biotin carboxylase subunit, a component of the acetyl coenzyme a complex was downregulated  <dig>  fold by heat stress but upregulated  <dig>  fold after subsequent recovery. in addition, two stress-related proteins of the hsp <dig> family  were also identified. the three remaining proteins in this group were not assigned.

additional file  <dig> shows nine proteins that were downregulated both by heat stress and subsequent recovery. light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex ii subunit b <dig>  in photosynthesis and a magnesium-chelatase  subunit chli- <dig> involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were identified in this group. cyanate hydratase which catalyzes the bicarbonate-dependent breakdown of cyanate to ammonia and bicarbonate in cyanogenic glycosides was also repressed both by heat stress and recovery. in addition, small subunit ribosomal protein sa and protein phosphatase 2c in protein metabolism was also repressed after heat stress and recovery.

analysis of proteins only responsive to heat stress
a total of  <dig> proteins showed a specific response to heat stress, with  <dig> upregulated proteins, and  <dig> downregulated proteins . five of the  <dig> upregulated proteins are related to photosynthesis, including psaf, three atp synthase subunits  involved in the photosystem electron-transfer reaction, and a fructose bisphosphate aldolase  involved in the calvin cycle. of note, the atp synthase cf  b subunit was upregulated  <dig>  fold by heat stress. ribosomal protein s <dig> involved in protein synthesis was also upregulated by heat stress. hsp <dig>  located in the endoplasmic reticulum, and hsp <dig>  located in the chloroplast, were induced  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively, under heat stress. cytoplasmic  superoxide dismutase , involved in redox, was also induced  <dig>  fold under heat stress. in addition, 14-3-3-like protein was upregulated  <dig>  fold by heat stress. among the  <dig> downregulated proteins , eight of them were involved in photosynthesis, including lhcb <dig> , psbp, and psal. many other proteins were involved in a variety of metabolic mechanisms, including glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, two malate dehydrogenase enzymes , nitrite reductase  <dig> in n-metabolism and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase involved in nucleotide metabolism. there are also some carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins, such as udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, which catalyze the reversible reaction between glycose-1-phosphate and udp-glycose, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle  and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway . three proteins were identified as being stress-related; including osmotin-like protein and hsp <dig>  two identified proteins, beta-1- <dig> glucanase and alcohol dehydrogenase, were annotated to miscellaneous enzyme families. in addition, ten proteins were involved in protein metabolism, including mitochondrial-processing peptidase subunit α and β, in protein targeting; methionine sulfoxide reductase a, in posttranslational modification; protease do-like  <dig>  and proteasome subunit α type- <dig> in protein degradation and a 20 kda chaperonin, involved in protein folding. there are also five proteins are not assigned.

analysis of proteins only responsive to recovery from heat stress
there were  <dig> proteins which were only upregulated after recovery from heat stress . four of these proteins are photosynthesis-related, including lhcb <dig> , psbs, petb. two upregulated stress proteins corresponded to the hsp <dig> family . hsp70- <dig> is located in the cytoplasm, while hsp70- <dig> is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in facilitating the assembly of multimeric protein complexes inside the endoplasmic reticulum. ribosomal proteins, including l <dig>  ef-ts, were also upregulated only upon recovery to heat stress.

thirty-six proteins were downregulated only after recovery to heat stress . eight downregulated proteins were involved in photosynthesis, including psbe, psad, petc, petd, fnr in light reaction and phosphoribulokinase, fba, fructose- <dig> - bisphosphatase in calvin cycle. two isoforms of fba, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase involved in glycolysis were also repressed after recovery from heat stress. down-expressed proteins involved in amino acid metabolism included aspartate aminotransferase, serine-pyruvate aminotransferase, ketol-acid reductoisomerase, and aminomethyltransferase. catalase  and apx involved in h2o <dig> detoxification were also downregulated after recovery from heat stress. several proteins from this group were unfortunately unidentified.

discussion
one of the many locations for heat stress injury in cells is the membrane. tbars is the product of lipid peroxidation in plants. the chlorophyll a fluorescence transient analysis  is a powerful tool to probe the psii reactions, which may help determine the state of the electron transport chain  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the tbars content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in grape leaves under heat stress and subsequent recovery . these results showed that young grapevines of the 'cabernet sauvignon’ varietal were damaged under heat stress at 43°c for 6 h, but they subsequently recovered at 25°c for 18 h. differential proteomic analysis of grapevines under these two conditions were also performed, and the findings are further discussed below.

electron transport chain and related proteins involved in the photosynthesis
photosynthesis is known to be one of the most heat sensitive processes due to its complex mechanisms and requirement for enzymes. it is directly related to plant productivity and energy utilization. in this study we identified  <dig> dysregulated proteins involved in photosynthesis, upon heat stress and subsequent recovery. these accounted for one fifth of all differentially expressed proteins in this study . moreover, enrichment analysis showed that photosynthesis was enriched under heat stress and/or recovery .

*the proteins were not quantified under heat stress or subsequent recovery.

hs refers to the fold change in heat stressed proteins, with respect to controls, while rc refers to the fold change in proteins after recovery, with respect to controls.

psii is thermally labile and is considered to be the most sensitive component of the electron transport chain  <cit> . the peripheral antennas of psii are composed of major trimeric and minor monomeric lhcii proteins. in this study, the expression of lhcii <dig>  and lhcii <dig>  was inhibited under heat stress and increased after recovery, which indicated that lhcii <dig>  and lhcii <dig> , might be thermally labile. lhcb <dig>  showed the same expression as control under heat stress while increased about  <dig>  fold after recovery, suggesting that lhcb <dig>  may be thermostable and solely involved in the recovery from heat stress. the oec activity is in close association with the 33 kda  and 23 kda . psbo is a key structural component of many different types of oecs and functions to stabilize the manganese cluster and modulate the ca2+ and cl- requirements for oxygen evolution  <cit> . additionally, the 10-kda psbr protein has also been found play a role in stable association of the psbp with the psii core for water oxidation  <cit> . in the present study, psbo- <dig> levels were not altered upon heat stress or subsequent recovery, the psbp precursor was repressed under heat stress but returned to control level after subsequent recovery, while psbr was elevated approximately eight fold with respect to its control under heat stress, and remained upregulated two fold upon subsequent recovery. in addition, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter wk showed that the oec of psii was damaged under heat stress, but returned back to the normal physiological level in the recovery phase . therefore, these combined results suggest that psbr may play an important role in maintaining the stability of the oec of psii compared to psbo and psbp in grape leaves.

in the present study, rcqa values decreased under heat stress and increased to the control level after subsequent recovery , indicating that the psii reaction center was inhibited by heat stress and then recovered when the stress was removed. the change of d <dig> protein corroborated this result . the multi-subunits  complex of cytb
6
/f is a crucial component for the acceptor side of electron transport chain of psii  <cit> . in the present study, three subunits petb, petd and petc were differentially expressed. the expression level of petb, petc and petd did not change significantly under heat stress, however, after recovery, the expression of petc and petd was largely inhibited while petb was induced. in addition, φeo and ψeo were reduced in grape leaves under heat stress, then returned to control levels with the subsequent recovery . this suggests that the function of the acceptor portion of the electron transport chain of psii including cytb
6
/f complex recovered from heat stress. these combined results suggest that petb may promote the cytb
6
/f complex to recover from heat stress.

the study showed that many proteins in the psi complex changed upon heat stress . psi consists of a core complex and a peripheral antenna. in plants, these two functional units result from the assembly of at least  <dig> protein subunits. the psi core complex contains  <dig> subunits, including psaa to psal and psan to psap which play important roles in psi function. for example, psaf is located in the thylakoid lumen, and contains a lysine-rich helix-loop-helix motif that has been demonstrated to interact with plastocyanin in plants and with plastocyanin  or cytochrome c
6
 in algae  <cit> . psan is necessary for the docking pc to the psi complex, and is the only subunit located entirely on the lumenal side of psi. in the present study, it was shown from the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter δro that psi was damaged under heat stress and recovered to the control level when returned to normal temperatures . consistent with this observation, the levels of psaa and psal declined under heat stress. however, the expression level of psaa remained  <dig> fold higher compared to the control after subsequent recovery, suggesting that psaa may have a positive effect in the recovery phase of psi. in addition, the expression of psaf, psah and psan increased by a  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold respectively under heat stress, which indicated that psaf, psah and psan might play a role of protection from heat stress in the psi complex of grape leaves. it is especially interesting that while all proteins of the psi complex inhibited under heat stress were hydrophobic, all proteins induced under heat stress were hydrophilic.

atp synthase produces atp from adp in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane. f-type atpase has two components, cf  - the catalytic core - and cf  - the membrane proton channel. cf  has five subunits: α, β, γ, δ and ϵ while cf  has four main subunits: a, b, b′ and c. the α chain is the largest subunit of the atp synthase. the γ chain is believed to be important in regulating atpase activity and the flow of protons through the cf  complex. in the study, all the identified atp synthase subunits ) were upregulated under heat stress, and all of them recovered to their control levels after subsequent recovery. especially, the expression of subunit b is increased by  <dig>  fold under heat stress. these result suggested that these three subunits may have a protective role against heat stress for atp synthase, and continue to provide energy for maintaining the normal physiological processes of grapevines.

proteins involved in abiotic stress and redox regulation
nineteen identified dysregulated proteins were functionally characterized as being involved in stress response . most of them were assigned to one of the four major classes of molecular chaperones, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and shsps, however, no proteins belonged to hsp <dig> family. plants respond to different abiotic stress by inducing the synthesis of proteins from the heat shock protein /chaperone family which have been shown to play a crucial role in protecting plants against stress by re-establishing normal protein conformations and thus cellular homeostasis  <cit> . in this study, nine hsps were differentially expressed under heat stress or after subsequent recovery. proteins from the hsp <dig> family do not only manage protein folding  <cit> , but also play a major role in signal-transduction networks, cell-cycle control, protein degradation and protein trafficking  <cit> . a previous study in p. euphratica showed that a putative hsp <dig> was upregulated early upon heat stress and later returned to control values  <cit> . in our study, three members of hsp <dig> family were identified and differentially expressed. two of them were inhibited, while the expression of hsp90- <dig> was not affected by heat stress. however, all of them were upregulated during subsequent recovery. proteins from the hsp <dig> family are essential for preventing aggregation and assisting re-folding of non-native proteins under both normal and stressing environmental conditions  <cit> . they are involved in protein import and translocation processes, and in facilitating the proteolytic degradation of unstable proteins by targeting these proteins to lysosomes or proteasomes  <cit> . previous reports have documented that hsp <dig> were accumulated under heat stress  <cit>  . in our research, three members of the hsp <dig> family were identified. one of the hsp <dig> family proteins was repressed under heat stress and recovered to the control level during the subsequent recovery  while the other two had no difference compared to their control under heat stress but were downregulated during the recovery phase . this suggests that the many isoforms of hsp <dig> play different roles under heat stress. in plants, the shsps are abundant and diverse, and can be classified into five families according to their cellular localization; including cytosol , chloroplast , endoplasmic reticulum , and mitochondrion   <cit> . in addition, shsps have been reported to be involved in protecting macromolecules like enzymes, lipids, nucleic acid, and mrnas from dehydration  <cit> . in our study, one protein  was predicted to be an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted shsp, whereas the other shsp  was predicted to be chloroplast-targeted. a previous study in arabidopsis showed the expression of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> significantly increased under heat stress  <cit> . in our study, the similar results were observed, and moreover, the expression of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> return to control levels after subsequent recovery. this also agrees with our previous findings, in which the mrna level of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> exhibited similar increases  <cit> . in addition, increased thermotolerance has been previously achieved by overexpressing the plastidial hsp <dig> in tomato  <cit> . therefore, these shsps may have the important functions in alleviating heat stress in grapevines.

the antioxidant enzymes are known to play important roles in scavenging or reducing excessive reactive oxygen species  which are produced under stress conditions, in order to maintain cell redox homeostasis  <cit> . in this study, we identified a group of antioxidant enzymes including  sod, cat, apx and thioredoxin.  sod which plays a central role in protecting against oxidative stress is generally found in the cytosol and chloroplasts . the cytoplasmic  sod showed considerable upregulation  under heat stress, followed by a return to the control level after subsequent recovery. this is in agreement with published results in the heat-tolerant agrostis scabra, while these redox proteins were not detected in the heat-sensitive agrostis stolonifera <cit> . in addition, the expression of apx increased under heat stress in our study. thioredoxins are small proteins catalyzing thiol-disulfide interchange, which is involved in the regulation of the redox environment in cells  <cit> . the most prominent candidates of proteins are thioredoxin h in populus euphratica oliv. and rice leaves, upon heat stress  <cit> . thioredoxin m <dig> was predicted to be located in chloroplast in our study, and was upregulated almost  <dig> fold under heat stress and maintained approximately  <dig> fold after subsequent recovery . these results suggest that cytosolic  sod, apx and chloroplastic thioredoxin have important roles in maintaining redox homeostasis in grapevine cells under heat stress .

proteins involved in metabolism
the expression of most proteins predicated to be involved in metabolism was slightly downregulated in grape leaves under heat stress , indicating that the metabolism of 'cabernet sauvignon’ grapevine was mildly affected under heat stress. in the present study, three proteins identified were involved in nucleotide metabolism. most significantly, ndpk <dig>  which plays a major role in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates other than atp was upregulated more than  <dig> fold under heat stress, and declined to  <dig>  fold following recovery, compared to controls. fukamatsu et al. showed that arabidopsis ndpk <dig> is a component of ros signaling pathways by interacting with three cats  <cit> . furthermore, in neurospora crassa, ndpk <dig> is suggested to control cats in response to heat, oxidative stress and light, and results have indicated that ndpk <dig> protein was translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in response to light, and may interact with cat  <cit> . together with our findings, we suggest that ndpk <dig> may play an important role in grape leaves in response to heat stress.

*the proteins were not quantified under heat stress or subsequent recovery.

proteins involved in glycolysis and tca in mitochondrial respiration
the regulation of the enzymes involved in respiratory carbon metabolism under heat stress has been a subject of debate. as shown in table  <dig>  there were six enzymes identified that are involved in glycolysis, which did not significantly change in expression level under heat stress while were downregulated after subsequent recovery. in addition, we found that five enzymes , which are involved in the tca cycle, were dysregulated in the study. with the exception of aconitase, the expression of these enzymes was inhibited under heat stress and recovered to the control level or showed a slight increase after subsequent recovery. the above results suggest that the glycolysis pathway was not influenced, while the tca cycle was inhibited by heat stress. we also hypothesize that during recovery, the tca cycle recovereds to control levels to consume the excess pyruvic acid produced by glycolysis. therefore, the glycolysis pathway may be more heat tolerant than the tca cycle in respiration in grapevines.

*the proteins were not quantified under heat stress or subsequent recovery.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a global look at the dysregulated proteins in grapevine leaves exposed to heat stress and after subsequent recovery using the itraq technique. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified in response to heat stress and/or subsequent recovery. on the basis of these findings, we propose that some proteins related to the electron transport chain of photosynthesis, antioxidant enzymes, hsps and the glycolysis pathway may play key roles in protecting grapevines from heat stress and enhancing their recovery capacity.
