BACKGROUND
a multitude of assays have been developed to measure t cell responses to a variety of antigens  <cit> . there is little agreement as to which method is the most superior for detecting immune responses. antigen specific t cell proliferation as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation and ifn-gamma elispot are two of the most commonly used methods to measure t cell immunity. we questioned if there was a difference in the ability of these assays to measure a broad range of t cell responses.

in this study we utilized t cells from cancer patients that had been immunized with both a her-2/neu protein based vaccine as well as a tetanus toxoid vaccine. both vaccines were successful in generating antigen specific antibody immunity, an indicator of immunization. evaluating three immunogenic proteins, her-2/neu, tt, and cmv in these patients as representative of low, intermediate, and robust responses we determined that the proliferation assay was a better discriminator of low level immune responses than elispot. these data highlight the need for immunologic monitoring core laboratories to define the performance characteristics of the methods chosen to assess the development of a t cell immune response.

RESULTS
antibody immunity to both foreign and tumor antigens is an indicator of a concomitant t cell response
a standard measure of successful immunization is the development of antigen specific humoral immunity  <cit> . furthermore, the presence of humoral immunity may serve as a marker for the presence of antigen specific cd4+ t cells  <cit> . breast cancer patients were immunized against the her-2/neu icd protein and tt, and humoral immunity to these antigens measured by elisa. antibody responses to cmv, a viral antigen presumed to stimulate a robust immune reaction, were also measured by elisa  <cit> . successful immunization against her-2/neu, as indicated by the presence of her-2/neu specific antibodies, was achieved in 89%  of patients. successful immunization against tt, as indicated by the presence of tt specific antibodies, was achieved in 100% of patients. forty-four percent of the patients were cmv seropositive. linear regression analysis of all results was performed to determine the correlation of antibody immunity to a detectable t cell response. antibody response predicted t cell response when t cell response was assessed by either proliferation assay  or elispot assay . humoral immunity significantly  predicted cd4+ t cell proliferation with an r <dig> of  <dig> , and humoral immunity significantly  predicted ifn-gamma secretion with an r <dig> of  <dig> . thus, humoral immunity and t cell immunity correlated in both foreign and tumor antigen systems.

the magnitude of the t cell response differed significantly between antigens . the range of t cell immunity to her-2/neu was low to moderate with a mean si of  <dig>   and a mean precursor frequency of  <dig>  precursors/ <dig> pbmc . responses to tt were moderate to robust with a mean si of  <dig>   and mean precursor frequency of  <dig> precursors/ <dig> pbmc . responses to cmv were robust with a mean si of  <dig>   and a mean precursor frequency of  <dig> precursors/ <dig> pbmc . mean antibody responses to her-2/neu, tt and cmv were  <dig>   ug/ml,  <dig>  ug/ml and  <dig>  ug/ml, respectively. we questioned the sensitivity of these two assays, cd4+ proliferation and ifn-gamma elispot, in detecting this wide range of responses.

t cell proliferation will detect t cell immunity whether the immune response is low, moderate or robust
roc curves were plotted to assess sensitivity and specificity of the proliferation assay, using presence of antigen specific antibodies as a marker of successful immunization. results show that si is a significant  predictor of immunity to the her-2/neu icd protein with an auc of  <dig>  . this yielded a sensitivity of 83%. a subset  of these patients was assessed by proliferation assay for cellular immunity to antigens tt and cmv. results show that si is a significant indicator of moderate cellular immunity to tt   with a sensitivity of 100%, and cmv  with a sensitivity of 100% . only  <dig> cmv seronegative patient had a positive cmv specific si. thus, the proliferation assay is capable of accurately detecting low, moderate, and robust t cell immunity.

ifn-gamma secretion as measured by elispot accurately detects robust t cell immunity
roc curves were plotted to assess sensitivity and specificity of the elispot assay, using presence of antigen specific antibodies as a marker of successful immunization. results show that elispot did not significantly detect low level immunity to her-2/neu or tt. precursor frequency is not a significant  indicator of immunity to the her-2/neu icd protein with an auc of  <dig>   and sensitivity of 64%. a subset  of these patients was assessed by elispot assay for cellular immunity to antigens tt and cmv. results show that precursor frequency is not a significant indicator of moderate level cellular immunity to tt  , but that elispot will significantly  predict robust t cell immunity to cmv with an auc of  <dig>  . the sensitivity for the elispot tt and cmv assays were 67% and 88%, respectively. thus, the elispot assay is most accurate when assessing robust t cell immunity.

there were few false positives in this population. that is, patients without an antibody response usually lacked a t cell response as well, by either t cell assay method. a cutoff of  <dig>  for si for the proliferation assay for her-2/neu specific cd4+ t cells accurately identified 78% of seropositive and seronegative samples, with  <dig> false positives and  <dig> false negatives. the her-2/neu elispot accurately identified 56% of seropositive and seronegative samples, with  <dig> false positives and  <dig> false negatives. the tt proliferation assay correctly identified all samples, and the tt elispot 67%, with  <dig> false negatives. the cmv proliferation assay correctly identified 88% with  <dig> false positive samples, and the cmv elispot correctly identified 92% of samples, with  <dig> false negative.

discussion
while infectious disease antigens, in general, stimulate a very robust t cell immune response that can easily be detected using a variety of assays, immunity to tumor antigens is generally low level. for this reason, to evaluate the immune response against cancer antigens, assays are needed that can detect a broad range of t cell responses i.e. from innate to induced immunity. we focused on evaluating the sensitivity of two commonly used methods for assessing tumor specific immunity; the proliferation of t cells after antigen exposure measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine and ifn-gamma elispot. compared to other methods of t cell assessment, such as flow cytometry or tetramer analysis, these assays are technically simple, easy to perform for all levels of lab personnel, require smaller numbers of cells, and reagents which are readily available and inexpensive.

very few studies have attempted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of assays that measure cellular immune responses after vaccination. a major problem preventing such an analysis is the definition of a parameter that predicts that immunity has been successfully elicited. we used the development of humoral immunity to indicate that tumor antigen and foreign antigen vaccinations were effective in stimulating a detectable immune response. humoral immunity has long been used as an accepted measure of successful immunization. presence of antigen specific antibodies indicates exposure to antigen and as such is considered proof of immunity  to common infectious diseases such as measles and influenza  <cit> . vaccine development for infectious disease continues to rely on antibody presence as an indicator not only of exposure to antigen  <cit> , but as a surrogate of protection against disease. indeed, antigen specific humoral immunity is an indicator for the development of an antigen specific t cell response. in one study, t cell responses measured by ifn-gamma elispot were significantly associated with antibody responses induced by vaccination against p. falciparum protein  <cit> . a recent population-based analysis of immune responses to mmr vaccination found that an antigen specific antibody response was significantly associated with antigen specific t cell proliferation, and that lymphoproliferation was in turn associated with production of ifn-gamma as measured by cytokine elisa  <cit> . thus, although not a perfect measure or "gold standard", humoral immunity can be used as a meaningful determinate of effective immunization by which the t cell assays could be assessed and compared.

antibody responses to tumor associated antigen demonstrate exposure to tumor, and may be significantly associated with antigen specific cellular responses. however, the relationship between presence of antigen specific antibodies, presence of antigen specific t cells, and clinical response in cancer is not as well characterized as the relationship between antibody and t cell responses, and clinical response in infectious diseases such as malaria. recently, the presence of tumor-infiltrating t cells has recently been associated with clinical response in various cancers, and antigen specific t cells have been shown necessary for tumor destruction  <cit> . thus, direct assay of t cell responses, both in terms of measuring quantities and frequencies of t cells and in terms of characterizing t cell function, remains an essential component in elucidating the relationship between immune responses and clinical outcome, and in the immunologic monitoring of clinical trials.

due to the large number of cells required to perform the proliferation and elispot assays, not all of the samples contained sufficient quantity to perform both assays. it is interesting to note that although the elispot assay for response to cmv tested only  <dig> samples, compared to the  <dig> samples tested for cmv responses by proliferation assay, both methods produced results which predicted positive humoral immunity to cmv. in contrast, all  <dig> samples were tested for her-2/neu specific responses using both elispot and proliferation assays, and only the proliferation assay produced results which were a significant predictor of antibody immunity. it is possible that the lack of concordance between tt specific results by elispot and tt specific antibody immunity is due to the difference in samples size between t cell assays, as only  <dig> samples were of sufficient quantity to obtain results by elispot, compared to the  <dig> available for testing by proliferation assay. similarly, cell quantities limited the elispot assay to measurement of only ifn-gamma. this may in part explain the elispot's lack of sensitivity in determining low level responses. although increasing the breadth of cytokine analysis to include measurement of other cytokine responses such as il- <dig> or il- <dig> may lead to greater sensitivity, the measurement of ifn-gamma alone is standard for most clinical trials.

CONCLUSIONS
the antigens we chose to evaluate, her-2/neu, tt, and cmv, represented a broad range of responses, from low level to robust. as the majority of patients developed humoral immunity to both her-2/neu and tt we were able to evaluate the two cell based analytic methods for the ability to detect low level t cell immunity. antigen specific t cell proliferation discriminated a broader range of responses than elispot. there have been few studies directly comparing t cell assays. one recent study, karlsson et al in  <dig>  compared elispot to cytokine flow cytometry and found a lack of association between results when considering low level responses, and that the elispot assay performed better in detecting such responses  <cit> . other groups compared thymidine incorporation proliferation assays to brdu elisa  <cit>  or cfse proliferation assay  <cit> . the first study found the brdu elisa performance superior to traditional proliferation assay in detecting low level responses; however, the study involved only cells obtained from rat lymph nodes, not human pbmc. the second study specifically looked at rare antigen specific t cells in human pbmc and found the cfse assay had superior sensitivity within a small sample set. the only study available which evaluates elispot and proliferation assays found that the proliferation assay was not sensitive enough to detect ca- <dig> specific t cells in  <dig> healthy controls or  <dig> patients with ovarian cancer  <cit> . data presented here, on a much larger number of individuals who have documented evidence of successful immunization, would suggest that there are marked differences in the ability of two of the most common cellular immunologic monitoring methods in measuring different levels of t cell immunity. these considerations should be taken into account when choosing analytic methods for assessing the development of t cell immunity, particularly when evaluating tumor specific immune responses which are, for the most part, of low to moderate magnitude.
