BACKGROUND
genetic linkage maps have been developed for several species. microsatellite markers have been commonly chosen in linkage maps because they exhibit codominant inheritance, have high degrees of heterozygosity, are widely distributed throughout the genomes, and provide comparative information between closely related species  <cit> . in aquaculture species, first generation, low resolution genetic linkage maps have been developed for many species, including tilapia   <cit> , channel catfish   <cit> , rainbow trout   <cit> , atlantic salmon   <cit> , brown trout   <cit> , european sea bass   <cit> , gilthead sea bream   <cit> , turbot   <cit> , atlantic halibut   <cit> , half-smooth tongue sole   <cit> , pacific abalone   <cit>  and oyster   <cit> . recently, second generation maps that span the genomes at higher resolution have been constructed. these maps contain several hundred of markers with microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with candidate genes. they have been constructed for tilapia  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , atlantic salmon  <cit> and channel catfish  <cit> .

japanese flounder, paralichthys olivaceus, is widely distributed along the coast of northeast asia and is one of the most economically important marine species in the region. p. olivaceus is successfully cultured in japan, china and korea. like other aquaculture species, japanese flounder is susceptible to several viruses, bacteria and protozoan pathogens, and may also show pigmentation abnormalities, which decrease its market price  <cit> . some economically important traits like disease resistance and growth are quantitative phenotypes and their genetic basis relies on the combined effects of quantitative trait loci   <cit> . information on genetic markers associated with qtl can be used in marker-assisted selection  breeding programs to identify and select individuals carrying desired traits. commercial production of japanese flounder could be increased by developing disease-resistant fish and improving commercially important traits. fuji et al.  <cit>  found a single major genetic locus associated with lymphocystis disease resistance in japanese flounder and succeeded in commercially producing a lymphocystis disease-resistant strain by marker-assisted selection .

linkage maps are essential tools to study qtl, therefore, sex-specific genetic linkage maps were first constructed for japanese flounder by coimbra et al.  <cit>  included a total of  <dig> di-nucleotide microsatellite markers and  <dig> aflp fragments and contained thirty linkage groups. that map was arbitrary named ba map, since it was based on a family bred out of strains "kp-a" and "kp-b" from kanagawa prefecture fisheries technology center. linkage maps need to be built mainly with codominant markers, which are representative of the same loci across studies. maps built with codominant markers can be used in different families and populations. therefore, new sex-specific maps  were constructed using  <dig> di-nucleotide microsatellite  <cit> . markers in those maps were distributed in  <dig> linkage groups; the number of linkage groups was in accordance with the haploid chromosome number of the japanese flounder  <cit> . moreover, gynogenetic diploids derived from the dam of the a <dig> map were used to estimate the centromeric regions in the map. additionally, a sex-averaged map was constructed based on  <dig> microsatellites from ba maps as well as other previously isolated markers and  <dig> newly developed est-derived microsatellites  <cit> .

haldane  <cit>  established that when meiotic recombination rates vary between sexes it is usually the heterogametic sex that has lower recombination. the sex with lower recombination rates is expected to transmit marker-qtl associations in tighter linkage. thus, the study of differences in recombination rates between sexes could be of great importance in mas programs  <cit> . though the sex determination systems of fish are variable, most fish species for which linkage maps have been developed exhibit male heterogamety. in these species, linkage mapping indicates that recombination rates in males are greatly reduced compared to females  <cit> . however, in a preliminary study of japanese flounder, males appeared to have higher recombination rates than females  <cit> . in this study, further analyses were performed using a larger number of markers. these analyses were performed with segregating data of the a <dig> family used for a construction of the a <dig> map, as well as the bace family of the improved genetic linkage map. this family was a hybrid from four strains from the kanagawa prefecture fisheries center, strains "kp-a", "kp-b", "kp-c" and "kp-e"  <cit>  and has been named bace.

in this report, we present significantly improved female and male maps , which contain  <dig>  markers, including microsatellites, snps  and two genes. these maps will facilitate the genome mapping efforts in japanese flounder and other related species. the mapping data could be compared to reference species and utilized for qtl analyses and further mas.

RESULTS
microsatellite markers
hybridization and sequencing results detected  <dig>  positive clones, containing  <dig>  microsatellite regions. a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed, and polymorphism was checked; 34% of the clones were polymorphic in both parents of the bace family and 21% of the clones were polymorphic in either the male or female of the family. among those markers,  <dig> microsatellites were selected and genotyped in the bace family. sequence data of the newly developed microsatellites have been deposited with the genbank data library under the accession nos: ef112585-ef <dig> and ab458899-ab <dig>  a list of the  <dig>  microsatellite markers included in the map is presented in additional file  <dig> 

snp markers
seventeen new "ab" snp marker, derived from new est sequences of japanese flounder were polymorphic in either the male or female of the bace family and were included in the map . they are represented in the bace map with their respective genbank accession numbers; ab <dig>  ab <dig>  ab275463-ab <dig> and ab275468-ab <dig>  the analysis of the est sequences obtained from the ncbi database resulted in  <dig> polymorphic snp markers .

markers in the bace map
a total of  <dig>  markers including  <dig>  microsatellites,  <dig> snps and  <dig> genes were mapped in sex-specific linkage groups. the male map contains  <dig>  markers and the female map contains  <dig>  markers . in accordance with the  <dig> haploid chromosome number of the families confirmed by a karyotype study  <cit> , markers were distributed along  <dig> linkage groups. the chromosomes of p. olivaceus are all acrocentric  <cit>  and centromeric regions have been estimated by centromere-mapping using gynogenetic diploids derived from a dam  <cit> . the linkage groups in figures  <dig> and  <dig> are represented with their predicted centromeric regions from the top of the group.

previous versions of the ba and a <dig> maps were built with only di-nucleotide microsatellites. the bace map includes di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide microsatellite markers as well as snp markers. as a general rule, the different kinds of markers appeared to be equally distributed along the linage groups. the microsatellite locus derived from the sequence of the mhc class ia genes in p. olivaceus was linked to jf <dig>  by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization , the locus in jf <dig> was identified in chromosome  <dig> among japanese flounder karyotypes characterized by c-band staining . mhc genes play an important role in the immune system. the genetic information developed in this work, together with the information of its location on chromosome  <dig>  could be of importance in the study of disease resistance. furthermore, other immune-related genes that have already been isolated for this species, like the immunoglobulin genes  <cit>  could be included in the map. in addition, the  <dig> s rrna gene was only polymorphic for the sire in the bace family and was placed in the linkage group jf <dig> m. by in situ hybridization, this gene was reported to be physically located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

map length and coverage
the total length of the male map is  <dig> . <dig> cm. linkage group sizes ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . the female map spanned  <dig>  cm. jf19f is unexpectedly short  and the longest linkage group  extends to  <dig>  cm. the maps contained several co-segregating loci. thus, the average resolution of the maps was estimated by collapsing those loci into "bins" and calculating the average inter-marker distances for all adjacent "bins" and single markers . the male and female maps had  <dig> and  <dig> unique positions, respectively, with average intervals of  <dig>  cm. and  <dig>  cm, respectively. the average estimated genome size of the male map  is longer than the speculated  <dig>  cm length found by coimbra et al.  <cit> . on the other hand, the female map  is in closer agreement with the length found by coimbra et al.  <cit>  . based on recent estimations of map lengths, the genome coverage of the male and female maps were 82% and 79%, respectively. the male map is  <dig>  times longer than the female map. however, this difference is not consistent along all linkage groups. some groups  are longer in the female map . a similar pattern was observed in turbot  <cit>  and atlantic halibut  <cit> .

over the entire length of the linkage groups, the distribution of the markers is not uniform. all linkage groups tend to be compressed in the estimated centromeric region in the male map and in the telomeric region in the female map . in females, a higher rate of recombination occurred in the centromeric regions across linkage groups. on the other hand, in males, a higher rate of recombination was observed in the telomeric regions. accordingly, a higher clustering of markers is observed in the telomeric regions of female maps and near the centromeric regions of male-specific linkage groups. despite the extremely large differences in the chromosomal localization of the sex-specific recombination spots in japanese flounder, when averaged over all markers in the genetic map, only small difference in female:male recombination ratios was observed .

annotation and synteny
a hundred and five ests showed high similarity to known protein . thirty-two of these ests significantly matched  sequences against t. nigroviridis, and  <dig> also matched d. rerio sequences . sixteen linkage groups  in the bace map could be associated with t. nigroviridis chromosomes, and nineteen jf lgs with d. rerio chromosomes. among jf lgs with at least two ests, seven jf lgs  were syntenic with individual t. nigroviridisn chromosomes, five of them  were also syntenic with individual d. rerio chromosomes and jf <dig>  jf <dig> and jf <dig> were associated to a single chromosome of both t. nigroviridis  and d. rerio . ests in jf <dig>  jf <dig>  jf <dig> and jf <dig> were associated with different chromosomes of d. rerio . no ests in a single jf lg were associated with more than one chromosome of t. nigroviridis. two t. nigroviridis chromosomes  and  <dig> chromosomes  of d. rerio were associated with ests from different linkage groups of the jf map .

discussion
recombination events in fish species usually occur once per chromosome arm, indicating the existence of interference after the formation of a single chiasma  <cit> . japanese flounder is a male-determined gonochoristic species  <cit>  and presents the same pattern of recombination as other fish species, in which the male presents a higher recombination rate closer to the putative telomere, and the female presents a higher recombination rate closer to the centromere. evidence of this phenomenon was reported in rainbow trout  <cit> ; brown trout  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit>  and atlantic halibut  <cit> . the a <dig> map  <cit>  and bace map of japanese flounder present the same pattern of recombination as other fish species. figure  <dig> is a schematic representation of linkage group  <dig>  and shows a clear example of this phenomenon, where a set of markers  is separated by  <dig>  cm from the centromeric region in the male map and  <dig>  cm in the male. in contrast, the first recombination point in the female map is located at  <dig>  cm from telomeric regions and  <dig>  cm in the male map. even though the lengths of the female and male maps were similar, coimbra et al.  <cit>  found an unexpected f:m 1: <dig> . in that study, because the male was gynogenetically produced, it is unclear whether the ratio was influenced by the genetic origin of the male. in addition, only a few markers from  <dig> linkage groups were used to perform the analyses. the actual positions of those markers in the chromosomes were determined in the marker-centromere map built by castaño-sánchez et al.  <cit> . all marker pairs analyzed by coimbra et al.  <cit> were placed far from the estimated centromeric regions, which are characterized by less recombination activity in the japanese flounder male map and higher recombination rates in the female map. reid et al.  <cit>  reported the recombination rate in female atlantic halibut to be twice that of the male, and observed a significant difference of f:m  <dig> : <dig>  analysis of overall recombination rates between males and females in the bace map confirmed a f:m ratio of 1: <dig> . the improved male map is  <dig>  times longer than the female map. conversely, the male sheep map  is  <dig>  times longer than the female map and cattle  maps present a very similar rate between sexes  <cit> . while all chromosomes in japanese flounder are acrocentric, the cattle karyotype contains  <dig> acrocentric autosomes and the sheep has  <dig> acrocentric and  <dig> metacentric autosomes  <cit> . in humans, there is evidence that recombination along the chromosomes depends on the chromosome structure  <cit> . the presence of acrocentric karyotypes in sheep and japanese flounder could explain the fact that the male map is slightly longer than the female map in those species, and accordingly, similar in length in the cattle map. these findings, together with the reported existence of gaps longer than  <dig> cm between adjacent markers in some linkage groups, might indicate poor coverage in certain regions of the female map. incomplete female maps might reflect that a higher proportion of crossovers in female generated maps will be missed, causing an underestimation of recombination rates in females relative to males, and therefore artificially decreasing f:m recombination ratios.

synteny among species or genera may provide opportunities to complement initial qtl experiments with candidate gene approaches from homologous chromosomal locations identified in related model organisms  <cit> . based on the sequence homology analysis, more of japanese flounder chromosomes were associated with t. nigroviridis chromosomes than d. rerio chromosomes; accordingly, japanese flounder is phylogenetically more closely related to t. nigroviridis than to d. rerio  <cit> . in addition, analysis results suggest that, during evolution, some chromosomes and regions have remained intact and others have been broken up. ancient actinopterygii  were postulated to have a  <dig> chromosome karyotype, composed of  <dig> a'-j' segments. those blocks were mosaically arrayed within the proto-actinopterygian karyotype and subsequently designated a-m . based on danzmann et al.  <cit> , the association of jf <dig> to d. rerio chromosomes dr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and jf <dig> with dr <dig> and  <dig>  might indicate a relation of those linkage groups to "m" ancestral grouping of actinopterygians. moreover, the association of jf <dig> to dr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> might suggests its relation to the "j" ancestral linkage groups, while jf <dig> is associated with dr <dig> and  <dig> and could be related to either ancestral "c" or "l" lineages, being "l" more likely. this data indicates that those linkage groups are likely remnants of regions that share a high degree of 3r duplicated segments.

low-density genetic linkage maps have been published for p. olivaceus  <cit> . the map developed in the present study was built with  <dig>  markers including  <dig>  microsatellites,  <dig> snps and two genes, which makes it more portable to other strains and families. this facilitates its application to qtl analyses as well as comparative mapping to reference animals. the average inter-marker distances  offer sufficient marker density for qtl studies  <cit> .

the improved maps, in addition to being useful for improving aquaculture strains, could be of assistance in the study of wild stocks in japan, where cultured p. olivaceus are being released into the wild. maintaining genetic variability is essential for the conservation of the species, not only to prevent inbreeding and bottleneck effects, but also to protect the genetic structure of natural stocks. several microsatellite markers included in the improved maps have been previously used in population studies, genetic tagging, parentage determination and genetic diversity  <cit> .

with  <dig>  markers, the new map is presently the densest flatfish linkage map. the number of genetic markers available for other flatfish species is relatively limited. in this report, we describe the production of a large number of polymorphic microsatellite markers for p. olivaceus which could be amplified in other closely related species. japanese flounder markers have already been used in the construction of the atlantic halibut linkage map  <cit> . despite the limited number of comparison points between japanese flounder and atlantic halibut, reid et al.  <cit>  found evidences of conserved syntenic regions as well as regions of chromosome rearrangements. the markers mapped in this study, could be an important tool for future comparative map studies and to establish the correspondence between linkage groups of different flatfish species.

the microsatellite markers included in previous versions of the map  <cit>  were consistently assigned to the same linkage groups in the newly developed maps. the order of those markers was conserved in most of the linkage groups. however, several markers co-segregate in clusters, preventing the determination of their precise order. several regions in the maps remain poorly covered. jf <dig> in both female and male maps is short and has only a small number of markers. the a <dig> map presented several gaps, which tended to occur towards the putative telomere in the male map and centromere in the female  <cit> . by adding more markers, several gaps were filled, but there is still the need to improve the centromeric regions of some linkage groups in the female map . further studies with segregating data from different families and larger number of progeny will be necessary to enhance the distribution of the markers in the linkage maps. physical maps could be constructed based on an existing bac  library  <cit>  and they could be useful to determine the precise distribution and order of the markers in the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the new high density genetic linkage map of japanese flounder indicated large differences in the location of sex-specific recombination hot-spots and produced comparative results against t. nigroviridis and d. rerio in synteny. this map could be of extreme importance for qtl analysis and mas breeding programs for economically important traits in japanese flounder as well as for comparative studies for related species and/or model fishes. the linkage maps have already been used in a mas breeding project to increase lymphocystis disease resistance  <cit> . the map is currently being used in qtl studies of edwardsiellosis, an infectious disease caused by edwardsiella tarda. qtl data will be eventually used to develop a new strain of japanese flounder with complex disease resistant traits.
