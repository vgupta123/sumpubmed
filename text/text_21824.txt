BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus belongs to the b. cereus group of organisms that comprises the genetically highly related organisms bacillus anthracis, b. cereus, bacillus mycoides, bacillus pseudomycoides, bacillus thuringiensis, and bacillus weihenstephanensis, which for the most part are capable of producing significantly different toxins. b. anthracis causes the fatal animal and human disease anthrax, whereas b. thuringiensis produces insecticidal toxins that are commercially used as biocontrol agents  <cit> . toxin producing b. cereus plays an important role as the causative agent of two types of food poisoning: diarrhea and emesis . the emetic syndrome caused by b. cereus is mainly characterized by vomiting a few hours after ingestion of the contaminated food while diarrhoeal poisoning is caused by heat-labile enterotoxins produced during vegetative growth of b. cereus in the small intestine  <cit> . the latter, diarrhea eliciting, toxins are well characterized at the molecular and the transcriptional level  <cit> . far less is known about the emesis causing toxin cereulide, which has twice been reported to have been involved in the death of a child due to liver failure  <cit> .

cereulide is a small, heat and acid stable cyclic dodecadepsipeptide which is chemically closely related to the potassium ionophore valinomycin  <cit> . it is toxic to mitochondria by acting as a potassium ionophore and has been reported to inhibit human natural killer cells  <cit> . according to its chemical structure one could expect cereulide to be synthesized enzymatically via nonribosomal peptide synthetases .

nrpss are large multifunctional proteins that have a modular organization. the modules, which show a conserved domain structure, selectively catalyze activation and thioester formation of one amino, α-hydroxy or carboxylic acid monomer  <cit> . a minimal module comprises an adenylation  that activates the cognate substrate and a thiolation domain  that binds the activated substrate. chain elongation of the peptide is catalyzed by condensation domains , located at n-terminal ends of modules which accept acyl groups from the preceding modules  <cit> . a c-terminal thioesterase domain  catalyzes the release of the mature nrps-bound peptide product  <cit> . some modules contain additional domains, like epimerization and methylation domains, that modify the incorporated constituents . the order of modules usually corresponds directly to the order of monomers in the peptide product  <cit> . quite recently, we identified a putative valine activating module that was highly conserved among emetic b. cereus. disruption of the corresponding gene by insertion mutagenesis revealed cereulide deficient mutants, providing for the first time unequivocal evidence for nonribosomal assembly of the emetic toxin cereulide  <cit> .

the main virulence factors of b. anthracis and insecticidal toxin genes of b. thuringiensis are located on large, well characterized virulence plasmids while diarrhea eliciting enterotoxins of b. cereus are located chromosomally. however, the exact genomic location and organization of the cereulide synthetase genes, which represent the main virulence factors of the emetic type of b. cereus, was hitherto unknown. the aim of this work was to completely sequence and characterize the genetic locus responsible for cereulide synthesis including the flanking genomic regions in order to gain insight into the synthesis mechanism of this peptide toxin, to determine the genomic location of the ces gene cluster and to study its conservation among b. cereus group members.

RESULTS
organization of the cereulide synthetase  gene cluster
the total sequence of the cereulide synthetase gene cluster  was dissected by module jumping and inverse pcr. sequence analysis showed that the ces gene cluster encodes  <dig> cdss: cesh, cesp, cest, cesa, cesb, cesc and cesd . cesh is located at the 5' end of the cluster  <dig> bp upstream of cesp in the same reading frame. cest is located  <dig> bp downstream from cesp while cesa overlaps with cest. cesb is separated by  <dig> bp from the stop codon of cesa. cesc and cesd are located in the 3' part of the ces gene cluster . no termination structures were predicted, neither between the cdss cesptabcd nor between cesh and cesp, but downstream of the cesd gene a hairpin structure was predicted using mfold  <cit> , indicative of the presence of a terminator sequence. the deduced protein sequence  from cesh  showed significant  identity to putative hydrolases/acyltransferases  from b. cereus group members. the following cds, designated cesp , showed high homology  to the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase from bacillus brevis and bacillus subtilis involved in nonribosomal synthesis of gramicidin s  and to surfactin , respectively  <cit> . cest starts with a gtg and is preceded by a putative rbs   <dig> bp upstream of the start codon. cest  showed significant similarity to bact from bacillus licheniformis , grst from b. brevis  and other thioesterases associated with nrps. the structural genes of cereulide synthetase are coded by the two large cdss  cesa and cesb. cesa and cesb, each of which is responsible for the activation and incorporation of two monomers in the peptide chain, show high homology to known nrps and pks-nrps hybrids. alignment of cesa and cesb revealed 32% identity and 53% similarity between these two proteins. cesc and cesd, located in the 3' part of the ces gene cluster, encode a putative abc transporter. abc binding cassettes and transmembrane domains, typical for the abc transporter family, were identified in these sequences.

analysis of the nrps domains of cereulide synthetases
the cesa synthetase harbors two modules with the domain structure ai-x-aii-t-c-a-t-e-c and the cesb synthetase shows the domain structure ai-x-aii-t-c-a-t-te . ai comprises the conserved core motifs a1–a <dig> while aii contains the core motifs a <dig> and a <dig>  and x refers to a region of unknown function. generally, the order of modules in a given nrps correlates to the order of monomers in the peptide product, hence cesa is expected to activate the precursors for d-o-leu  and d-ala , while cesb is expected to be involved in the activation of a precursor of l-o-val  and the activation and incorporation of the proteinogenic amino acid l-val . using the amino acid specificity code  <cit> , the substrate activated by the modules cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> could be clearly predicted to be ala and val, while no a domain specificities could be predicted for the modules cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> . however, alignment and genetic analysis of a domains revealed significant similarities between the latter modules, which are involved in the incorporation of the non-proteinogenic oxy acids . a comparison of the a domain core motifs showed that these are less conserved in cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> than in cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> . in addition, the a domains of cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> are interrupted by an insertion  of about  <dig> amino acids between the a <dig> and a <dig> core motifs. the inserted sequences from cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> showed 25% identity and 40% similarity. comparison to database sequences revealed no significant homology of the first  <dig> aa of these sequences, while the c-terminal part of the insertions showed significant similarities to enzymes belonging to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily . the module cesa <dig> contains an epimerase  domain, which is consistent with the d-stereochemistry of the ala residue of cereulide. in the c-terminal region of cesb a putative thioesterase  domain comprising  <dig> amino acid residues  was identified .

sequence and analysis of flanking regions of the ces operon
the flanking regions of the ces operon were sequenced by inverse pcr and the resulting sequences were searched against ncbi's non-redundant database using blast algorithms. the 5' region and the 3' region of the ces genes showed significant homology  to b. anthracis toxin-encoding pxo <dig> plasmid sequences and to pbc <dig>  <cit> . to gain additional sequence information primers were designed using b. anthracis plasmid pxo <dig> sequence information. a total of  <dig>  kb upstream and  <dig>  kb downstream of the ces operon was sequenced. the corresponding upstream cdss showed high identities  to hypothetical proteins located on virulence plasmids of b. anthracis, b. thuringiensis, and b. cereus , pbtoxis , pe33l <dig> , pbcxo <dig>  and pbc <dig> ). sequence analysis of the downstream region revealed  <dig> hypothetical proteins with homologies of more than 90% to hypothetical proteins from pxo <dig>  pbcxo <dig> and pbc <dig>  the region downstream of the ces genes is nearly identical to the corresponding sequence of pbc <dig> , while no significant homology to pbtoxis could be observed. the sequence of the dna region upstream from ces is 94% identical to the corresponding sequence of pbc <dig> and 88% identical to pbtoxis, respectively.

pfge and hybridization studies
undigested genomic dna from selected emetic and emetic-like b. cereus strains was separated by pfge, blotted on a membrane and hybridized to probes that were directed either against the cereulide synthetase genes  or against a cds located in the flanking region of the ces genes . the hybridization results  showed that the cereulide synthetase is located on a megaplasmid, designated pbce <dig>  of the same size as pbc <dig> . no hybridization signals were obtained from the non-emetic strains tested. emetic-like strains reacted positively with the pxo1- <dig> derived probe but not with the ces probe. however, the sizes of the plasmids reacting with pxo1- <dig> differed slightly from that of the emetic strains . additional probes targeting different modules of the cereulide synthetase operon and its flanking regions were designed, and slot blot analysis was carried out to determine if parts of the ces gene locus are conserved in non-emetic b. cereus group strains. none of the non-emetic strains reacted with any of the ces genes derived probes , while some of the strains, especially emetic-like strains, were positive in hybridization assays with pxo <dig> derived probes . the corresponding plasmid from one of these emetic-like strains, pbcel <dig> from b. cereus nvh 1519- <dig>  was partially sequenced using primers designed from pbce <dig> sequence with similarity to pxo <dig> 

discussion
the cereulide synthetase operon
we have sequenced a  <dig> kb genetic region in the b. cereus emetic reference strain f4810/ <dig> involved in the biosynthesis of cereulide. previous knock out mutants have shown that this toxin is produced by a multi-enzyme complex named cereulide synthetase  <cit> . the chemical structure of cereulide is reflected in the genetic organization of its synthetase genes . this gene cluster comprises, besides the typical genes such as a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase  essential for activating the nrps  and the structural genes responsible for the assembly of the peptide product, a putative type ii thioesterase  which could potentially remove misprimed monomers and regenerate the nrps  <cit> . a putative hydrolase  is located in the 5' part of the cereulide biosynthesis cluster and a putative abc transporter  is encoded in its 3' part. cesc/d might either be involved in the transport of cereulide or confer self resistance towards cereulide.

the structure of the ces genes and number of modules predicts a monomeric tetrapeptide but cereulide is a trimeric depsipeptide . a similar structure has been described for gramicidin s and enterobactin. synthesis of those peptides is carried out by one nrps that is regenerated and repetitively used for synthesis. in case of such iterative processes the te domains have additional functions allowing the collinear synthesis to be repeated two or three times . the exact mechanism of these iterative tes is not yet known, but mutation studies provided evidence that the te domain of e. coli entf catalyzes cyclolactonization as well as chain elongation  <cit> . a similar mechanism resulting in intramolecular trimerization might also be involved in cereulide assembly.

unusual structure of heterocompound activating modules
the a domains of the heterocompound activating modules cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> are less conserved than the a domains from cesa <dig> and cesb <dig>  which activate the amino acid moieties . especially, the core motifs a <dig> and a <dig> differ significantly from the typical consensus motifs described by marahiel et al.,  <cit> . nevertheless, they show some homology to the corresponding motifs of phenylacetate activating modules mycg-a and ndac and to aryl acid activating modules dhbe and ente  <cit>  . the crystal structures of the phenylalanine-activating a domain of gramicidin s synthetase and the structure of dhbe involved in bacillibactin synthesis revealed a decisive role of the core motifs a <dig> and a <dig> in substrate binding and selection  <cit> . the altered a <dig> and a <dig> core motifs found in cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> did not allow substrate prediction for these modules. the a <dig> motif usually represents the first anchor in amino acid activating domains, however this core motif is missing in dhbe as its substrate does not contain any α-amino-group. in dhbe the a <dig> motif, as well as the a <dig>  is replaced by another sequence motif that is thought to be specific for carboxy acid activating enzymes  <cit>  while the residue k <dig> is conserved in α-amino acid activating domains, in the carboy activating domain of dhbe, as well as in cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> . since the a <dig> and a <dig> motifs of the two hydroxy acid incorporating modules of the cereulide synthetase are quite similar, it is tempting to speculate that the motifs are characteristic for a special type of substrate . detailed biochemical and structural analysis will be necessary to clarify the substrate specificity of these modified a domains. nevertheless, the altered motifs found in cesa <dig>  cesb <dig> and other nrpss might be useful to identify yet unknown a domains activating new types of substrates.

in addition, about  <dig> amino acids are inserted between the core motifs a <dig> and a <dig> in cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> . different types of insertions in a domains located at this position have been described for bacterial nrps such as methyltransferases and oxidoreductases  <cit> . since the n terminal part of the insertion  in cesa <dig> and cesb <dig> did not reveal any significant homologies to characterized proteins from database entries, no decisive function could be attributed to these domains in the cereulide synthetase. however, the c terminal part of both insertions showed homologies to short chain dehydrogenases  and ketoreductases  . in addition to the rossmann fold motif, sdr catalytic tyr and ser residues, which are also highly conserved in reductase domains from polyketide synthetases   <cit> , were identified . as in kr domains the catalytic lys residue of sdrs is substituted by an asn in cesa <dig> and cesb <dig>  it is therefore tempting to speculate that the inserted domains x  might indeed catalyze the ketoreduction of the substrates bound to cesa <dig> and cesb <dig>  respectively.

the megaplasmid encoded cereulide synthetase genes are restricted to emetic strains
in order to investigate the distribution and conservation of the ces genes among b. cereus group members, southern blot analysis was performed using different probes that target all cdss belonging to the ces operon and hypothetical cdss located in the periphery of these genes. special emphasis was placed on emetic-like strains since these are closely related to emetic strains but do not produce cereulide  <cit> . our results revealed a strict confinement of ces genes to cereulide producers . the putative hydrolase encoded by cesh was not detected in the non-emetic b. cereus group strains and is therefore considered an integral part of the ces gene locus. however, several non-emetic strains, especially emetic-like strains, were positive in hybridization studies using probes derived from ces flanking pxo <dig> homolog cdss . a high conservation of pxo <dig> genes among b. cereus group members and other closely related bacilli has previously been reported  <cit> , but no information on emetic or emetic-like strains was provided in this study. recently it has been reported that cereulide production depends on the presence of a plasmid. cured emetic strains lost their ability to produce cereulide  <cit> . our hybridization experiments  showed that the cereulide synthetase encoding plasmid pbce <dig> is of the same size as the sequenced pxo <dig> related plasmid pbc <dig>  from b. cereus atcc  <dig>  <cit> . the latter, however, does not carry the ces genes. plasmid sizes from emetic-like strains were slightly variable, but partial sequences of the plasmid pbcel <dig>  from the emetic-like strain nvh1590- <dig> revealed an identity of nearly 100% to pbc <dig> and 90% to pxo <dig>  a comparison of virulence plasmids from b. cereus group members and the partially sequenced plasmids pbce <dig> from the emetic b. cereus reference strain f4810/ <dig>  and pbcel <dig> from the emetic-like strain nvh1519- <dig>  showed that the ces gene locus is inserted in a highly conserved part of these virulence plasmids between genes with similarities to pxo1- <dig> and pxo1- <dig> . however, the inserts differ: at this location on pxo <dig> and pbcxo <dig> are the genes for pxo1- <dig>  a hypothetical virulence factor, and pxo1- <dig>  whereas pbce <dig> contains the ces locus responsible for cereulide synthesis, and pbc <dig> and pbcel <dig> both possess an identical  <dig> kb insert of unknown function. downstream of this genetic locus a group ii intron has recently been described in pbc <dig>  <cit>  that is also present in pbce <dig> and pbcel <dig> . at the corresponding genetic region in pxo <dig> a group i intron has been identified  <cit> . group i and group ii introns were also found in other sequenced b. cereus group strains. quite recently, evidence was provided that the group ii introns splice in vivo  <cit> . this ability to splice is a prerequisite for mobility and insertion into new dna target sites, and could become beneficial for the organism under stressful conditions.

evolution of different toxin plasmids from an ancient virulence plasmid in a b. cereus ancestor?
the key role of the toxin plasmid pxo <dig> in anthrax pathogenesis and the importance of toxin harboring plasmids for insecticidal pathogenesis of b. thuringiensis are well known, whereas knowledge about the function of b. cereus plasmids is quite limited . our present work revealed a third type of b. cereus group toxins being encoded by a megaplasmid: the biosynthetical genes responsible for the emetic type of b. cereus food borne disease are also located on a pxo1-like plasmid . thus, all species specific toxins of the b. cereus group are located on megaplasmids while the enterotoxins, which are broadly distributed among b. cereus group members  <cit> , are localized on the chromosome. blast searches using the partial pbce <dig> sequence revealed high similarities  of the ces gene flanking regions to pxo <dig> and the b. cereus plasmids pbc <dig> and the pxo1-like plasmid pbcxo <dig>  and high similarities  in the 5' region of ces to the insecticidal toxin plasmid pbtoxis and a plasmid designated pe33l <dig> from a b. cereus strain isolated from a dead zebra. comparison of selected pxo1-like cdss from f4810/ <dig> revealed an overall identity of about 95% of bce <dig> to pbc <dig>  about 92% identity to pbcxo <dig>  and about 90% identity to pxo <dig>  like pbc <dig>  emetic strains seem to lack the b. anthracis pai encoded virulence genes since no hybridization signals were obtained with probes targeting these genes . the data presented in this work will contribute to developing a better understanding of the evolution and distribution of this group of plasmids. one might speculate that a plasmid in an ancestral form has been present in b. cereus group strains, which over time has acquired virulence genes conveying different disease causing phenotypes. nevertheless, a detailed phylogenetic analysis of plasmids-focusing on mobile elements- from all members of the b. cereus group will be necessary to unravel the role of plasmids in pathogenesis and evolution of the b. cereus group of organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
the characterization of the ces genes illustrated the high flexibility of the module organization of bacterial nrps. a new type of insertion in a domains has been observed in the modules cesa <dig> and cesb <dig>  no clear function could be assigned to the inserted domains, although hundreds of nrps modules have been sequenced and biochemically characterized. the characterization of the cereulide synthetase genes and its flanking regions revealed the extra-chromosomal location of the main virulence factor of emetic b. cereus on a plasmid with a pxo1-like backbone. sequencing of the entire plasmids from emetic and emetic-like strains could provide new insight into the evolution of toxin producing members of the b. cereus group, especially elucidation of the evolution of b. anthracis and the emetic lineage of b. cereus.
