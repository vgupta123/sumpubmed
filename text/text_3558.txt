BACKGROUND
in an effort to increase crop production, farmers and producers apply millions of tons of fertilizers such as nitrogen  each year. in  <dig>  demand for n fertilizer was  <dig>  million tons and is expected to steadily increase to  <dig> million tons by  <dig> worldwide  <cit> . only around 33% of the n applied is taken up by cereal crops such as maize  <cit> , while the remaining n is lost due to a combination of factors including leaching, de-nitrification, and surface runoff from the soil. these issues affect the environment and input costs negatively  <cit> .

the root system is essential for plant species to absorb and acquire mineral nutrients such as n. plant species such as maize  have two general mechanisms to increase nutrient acquisition: 1) develop a larger root system that allows plants to come into contact with a larger soil volume, and 2) increase the trans-membrane nutrient-uptake rate. increased root size allows plants to increase available nutrient uptake based on demand within a limited time frame  <cit> . root architecture and development has been shown to be a key component in nitrogen use efficiency   <cit> , and drought tolerance  <cit> . understanding root development and the molecular mechanisms that influence root architecture is thus important for increasing yield potential and yield stability under varying environmental conditions and soil profiles  <cit> .

maize has five main types of roots: crown, seminal, primary, lateral, and brace roots  <cit> . the primary and seminal roots make up the embryonic root system and their fate is largely determined by genetic background  <cit> . the major portion of adult root biomass is derived from postembryonic shoot-borne roots, crown roots which are formed below the soil surface and brace roots which are formed above the soil surface  <cit> . lateral roots are initiated from the pericycle of other roots and have a strong influence on maize root architecture  <cit> . their function is important to plant performance as they are responsible for a crucial part of water and nutrient uptake, such as n in maize. it has been shown that n rich soil environments enhance root growth and dry weight  <cit> . root size has been shown to be a key component in the uptake of phosphorus, calcium, in addition to n  <cit> . increasing root size and, therefore, root surface area might be a strategy plants use to increase absorption efficiency, when nutrients such as n are limiting  <cit> . thus genomic regions affecting root development and growth could affect nue, water use efficiency, and nutrient use efficiency as roots with increased root length and surface area may perform better in nutrient deficient environments. several genes have been described that affect the development of the root system in maize including rtcs , rth <dig> , rth <dig> , and rum <dig> . rtcs controls crown root and seminal root formation; rtcn and rtcl are thought to be paralogs of rtcs. rth <dig> and rth <dig> control root hair elongation with rth <dig> being shown to affect grain yield in maize  <cit> . while these genes have been identified, there are many loci effecting root growth and development that remain unknown.

a useful method for analyzing the genetic diversity of complex traits and identification of superior alleles is association mapping or linkage disequilibrium  mapping  <cit> . unlike traditional linkage mapping, where bi-parental populations are developed, association mapping uses ancestral recombination in natural populations to find marker-phenotype associations based on ld  <cit> . association mapping allows evaluation of a large number of alleles in diverse populations  <cit> , and offers additional advantages compared to traditional linkage mapping, including high mapping resolution and reduction in time to develop a mapping population  <cit> . there are two main association mapping strategies. the candidate gene approach focuses on polymorphisms in specific genes controlling traits of interest, while genome-wide association approaches survey the entire genome for polymorphisms associated with complex traits  <cit> . a candidate gene association analysis approach was employed using genes rtcl, rth <dig>  rum <dig>  and rul <dig>  <cit> . several polymorphisms within all four candidate genes were associated with seedling root traits. many of these significant polymorphisms affected putative functional sequence motifs including transcription factor binding sites and major domains. another study  <cit>  used  <dig> elite chinese maize lines to investigate sequence variation and haplotype diversity for the root development gene rtcs. they too found extensive variation between lines at the gene sequence level. the advent of more economic sequencing technologies facilitates genome-wide studies. using markers covering the entire genome increases the chance of identifying additional regions of the genome associated with seedling root traits, and establishing relevance of above mentioned candidate genes to other genes affecting root development. in this study, a panel of  <dig> inbred lines derived from the ames panel  <cit>  was used to conduct a genome-wide association study  to investigate root architecture at the seedling stage. our hypothesis is that root architecture is of quantitative inheritance and that there are multiple factors throughout the genome that contribute to root development. the objectives of this study were to i) study phenotypic variation of  <dig> root architecture traits within a maize association panel, ii) identify snp markers throughout the genome associated with root architecture traits, and iii) investigate locations of associated snp markers for possible candidate genes or functional markers having an effect on root development.

RESULTS
analysis of phenotypes of  <dig> ames panel inbred lines
almost all root traits captured followed a normal distribution with a slight left skew. trait descriptions are found in table  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  most traits had considerable variation within the current mapping population. the standard deviation for traits such as total root length  and secondary root length  varied the most with values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. all trait maximum, minimum, and standard deviations are listed in table  <dig>  a few lines’ phenotypes were consistently placed in the tails of the distribution for multiple traits. line pht <dig> had the highest values for trl, sel, surface area , and network area . these traits are all highly and significantly  correlated with one another  with r =  <dig> . nwa is also highly correlated with root median  and total number of roots , yet pht <dig> doesn’t have the highest values for these traits. this can be due to many reasons, one being that much of pht77’s root length comes from the individual length of its secondary roots; this also increases root surface area  and nwa. this also lowers pht77’s tnr and med as there are fewer number of secondary roots present for this maize line. a <dig> showed the lowest values for root perimeter , tnr, med, and maximum number of roots . interestingly, these traits were significantly  but not always, closely correlated, ranging from r =  <dig>  to  <dig> . heritability  estimates for all traits were low to moderate and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . due to the low heritability estimates of some traits, and in accordance with other similar studies analyzing root traits  <cit> , a cutoff of h2 ≥  <dig>  was made, and most traits with h2 <  <dig>  were excluded from further analysis.table  <dig>

pearson correlations were calculated comparing the same traits   measured in a previous association panel  <cit>  that used the same measuring techniques as in this study by comparing lines that were the same between both mapping populations. this was done to determine, if growing conditions were consistent and if aria calculated measurements were consistent with result obtained from image analysis software whinrhizo pro  <dig> . both traits were significantly correlated  between both methods with values of r =  <dig>  for trl and r =  <dig>  for tpb .

correlation coefficients were calculated for the  <dig> traits listed in table  <dig>  the two traits with the closest correlation were trl and sel , indicating that much of the root system is made up of lateral and seminal root length, not the primary root at the 14 day old seedling stage. correlations were lower between trl and primary root length   and between prl and sel . correlations for  <dig> kernel seed weight  were also calculated to determine whether kernel size had a major effect on seedling root size, which was collected prior to growing plants in the growth chamber. none of the seedling traits collected showed a strong  correlation with kernel weight .table  <dig>

linkage disequilibrium decay in ames panel subset
a random subset of markers spanning across all  <dig> chromosomes  was used to calculate ld decay. the rate of ld decay was similar across chromosomes with an average distance of reaching the ld threshold  within approximately 10 kb throughout the genome. chromosome  <dig> showed the slowest decay with an r <dig> value of  <dig>  reached at approximately 15 kb . these results are comparable to  <cit> , indicating that ld decayed within 1-10 kb.figure  <dig>

population structure
in order to define the number of subpopulations within the  <dig> line ames panel subset, the ad hoc statistic  was calculated. based on the ad hoc statistic values in structure  <dig> . <dig> the mapping population was sorted into two subpopulation . one subpopulation comprised of  <dig> lines or 83% of the total  <dig> lines used for gwas . this larger subpopulation is composed of mostly non-stiff stalk inbred lines with some tropical, popcorn, and mixed lines. the other subpopulation includes mostly genotypes from the stiff-stalk heterotic group. b <dig> is found within this subpopulation whereas mo <dig> is found in the larger subpopulation.figure  <dig>

genome-wide association studies
four snp markers were found to be significantly associated with two root traits using mlm. the threshold to account for multiple testing was determined by simplem at p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  specifically, one significant marker-trait association was found for bushiness  located on chromosome  <dig> , and three significant snp marker trait associations for standard root length  were located on chromosome  <dig> . based on heritability estimates both traits were found below the threshold to be examined in depth. due to the stringency of mlm, and the fact that significant markers found for both traits are located in regions of the genome consistent with significant markers for other root traits using glm, it was decided that these significant snps be used for further examination. all three significant markers for srl were found within gene models. marker s4_ <dig> was found within gene model grmzm2g <dig>  expression analysis based on b <dig> showed very little to no expression within roots. the two other markers  significantly associated with srl were found within gene model grmzm2g <dig>  this gene model did show expression both at germination and at v <dig> stage of maize development in the primary root with absolute expression levels of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . the one significant marker for bsh on chromosome  <dig> was found within gene model grmzm2g <dig> and showed very little to no expression in the roots throughout early development. no other traits were found to have significant marker trait associations using the q + k mlm model.figure  <dig>

using the glm model, an additional  <dig> significant markers were found using the same threshold of p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for root traits above the heritability threshold of h2 ≥  <dig> . clustering of significant snps using glm was analyzed. snps associated with root traits clustered on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . chromosome  <dig> also contained the snp marker with the highest significance. most significant markers on chromosome  <dig> were located in bins  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> . clusters on chromosome  <dig> were located within bins  <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  while clusters on chromosome  <dig> were within bin  <dig> . on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  four markers in total were significantly associated with multiple traits. chromosome  <dig> had  <dig> markers; marker s2_ <dig> was significant for prl, per, diameter , depth , shoot dry weight , tbp, and sua. marker s2_ <dig> on chromosome  <dig> is associated with traits sua, sdw, sl, and tpb. the third and final marker on chromosome  <dig> was marker s2_20252886; this marker is associated with both sua and tbp. these three significant markers are found within gene models grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig>  the final marker is s8_ <dig> and was associated with both per and dep. this marker on chromosome  <dig> is located in gene model grmzm2g <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> markers were found significantly associated with multiple traits. all  <dig> markers on chromosome  <dig> are located within 250 kb. nine of these markers are located within the same gene model, grmzm2g <dig>  of the remaining four markers on chromosome  <dig>  two are located in the same gene model grmzmzg427409; one is located in another gene model grmzm2g <dig> while the remaining marker is located in an intergenic region. four of the previously listed gene models have hypothetical protein products. an earlier expression analysis  <cit>  revealed that most of the predicted gene models described above had moderate to low expression levels in the primary root system at growth stage v <dig> in b <dig>  absolute expression levels measured in b <dig> for respective gene models are listed in table  <dig>  when looking at snps close to previously reported genes with an impact on root development , one significant snp marker at position  <dig> , <dig> on chromosome  <dig> is located a little more than  <dig> mbs from rum <dig>  no other significant markers were located in or near previously reported root development genes. a list of all significant marker trait associations is found in additional file 2: table s <dig>  manhattan plots for all marker trait associations using glm are found in additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

discussion
root traits are difficult and laborious to measure at the adult stage in a field setting. in the current study, measurements of seedling root architectural traits in our association mapping population were used as a first step for later comparison with adult plant traits. one of the traits studied, rdw, has been shown to be positively correlated with key adult plant traits such as yield at both hn and ln conditions  <cit> , suggesting that seedling root traits may be useful to predict adult root characteristics. one concern with studying seedling roots is that seed size might be confounded with overall seedling vigor including expression of root traits. however, all seedling root traits had low correlations  with kernel weight.

root architecture is a key plant characteristic but highly variable among maize genotypes. table  <dig> demonstrates this wide range of variation for most traits studied herein. for trl, a 9- to10-fold difference was found within the current mapping population, specifically three lines  that were all recorded as having the lowest trl average measurements and the three lines with the longest average root length . this range exceeded the 3- to 4-fold differences in a separate, albeit smaller  association panel  <cit> . this large range for average length of roots illustrates the extensive amount of phenotypic variation found for roots. this range in trait values among inbred lines can be compared to other studies of diverse maize panels  <cit> , where there was a 3- and 2-fold difference for plant height and days to anthesis, respectively. in conclusion, there is substantial unexploited variation for root traits.

heritability values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . previous studies have shown similar ranges of heritabilies for root traits at various stages of growth, both under controlled environmental  and field conditions  <cit> . root growth is highly plastic and of quantitative nature. by keeping all conditions equal, some root traits were more repeatable than others. biomass traits ) as well as tnr had mid-range heritabilities close to  <dig> . other traits that deal with total length of roots or a particular part of the root  also had heritabilities greater than  <dig> . this may be due to the software aria’s ability to accurately measure length based traits. some traits with low heritabilities in our study of 2d traits may be better suited for three dimensional images such as bsh, dep, length distribution , and width/depth ratio . prl showed a low heritability estimate . this could be due to limitations in aria’s ability to identify the primary root accurately each time, or is a product of prl sensitivity to micro environmental conditions. we included prl in the present study, as this trait has been shown to be important in water and nutrient acquisition  <cit> .

population structure and linkage disequilibrium
population structure analysis using the software package structure  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  revealed two subpopulations. the two identified populations fit the two major heterotic groups within temperate u.s. maize germplasm: stiff stalk  and non-stiff stalk . the larger subpopulation contained over 82% of the lines in the association panel, this subpopulation was made up of non-stiff stalk inbred and few mixed heterotic group lines. these results are consistent with results from a principle component analysis  of the entire ames panel consisting of over  <dig> lines  <cit> . in that study, most lines derived from the u.s. grouped in two distinct groups, stiff stalk and non-stiff stalk.

average ld decay  across the whole genome was close to 10 kb. these results agree with a ld decay of 10 kb across expvp, stiff stalk, and non-stiff stalk lines within the entire  <dig>  inbred lines within ames panel  <cit> . romay et al.  <dig>  used the same gbs marker data set in order to analyze the entire ames panel diversity. the subset of inbred lines from the ames panel used in this study lacks diversity from tropical lines that are available within the complete ames panel. if more exotic maize germplasm is included as in other association mapping populations, the rate of decay is usually more rapid  with added diversity  <cit> .

association analysis
there have been several large scale genome-wide association studies which have been used to identify candidate genes and putative functional markers that affect complex traits  <cit> . in the current study, four snps were significantly associated with root traits bsh, and srl using the q + k mlm. when fitting just population structure using glm,  <dig> snps were significantly associated with root traits. among those,  <dig> were significantly associated with multiple root traits. three of these  <dig> snps were located in similar positions on chromosome  <dig>  snp s2_ <dig> was significantly associated with seven traits, prl, per, dia, dep, sdw, tpb, and sua. all seven traits are closely and significantly correlated with one another . this trend continued for all traits sharing significant snps: all were significantly correlated with one another . other snps associated with multiple traits were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  three root qtl studies  <cit>  identified a qtl on chromosome  <dig> within bin  <dig> - <dig> . in this region,  <dig> of the shared, significantly associated snps were located. these results provide evidence that relevant candidate genes affecting root growth and development are likely located on chromosome  <dig> 

the only two traits  for which significant snps were detected using mlm had low heritability estimates. since associations were found fitting both the q and k matrix, the risk of type i error is low. bsh and srl are components of other traits . thus, significant polymorphisms for bsh and srl might act pleiotropic and affect traits with higher heritability. for a few traits, no significantly associated markers were detected , convex area , sel, and center of point ). the number of detected associations was not related to heritability. tpb had the highest heritability estimate with h2 =  <dig>  and  <dig> significant snps were detected for this trait, while only two snps were detected for tnr with comparably high heritability . conversely,  <dig> snps markers were significantly associated with diameter  . different reasons may account for this discrepancy, such as  tight linkage of multiple associated snps for a low heritability trait,  absence of detectable snps in genome regions impacting high heritability traits, and  unknown trait architecture, i.e., number of genes and distribution of gene effects with impact on traits of interest.

glm is less stringent than mlm. this explains the large discrepancy between vastly different numbers of significant associations detected by the two methods of calculation. as noted in other studies  <cit> , mlm can over fit a model and create type ii errors. thus, using both methods in conjunction is preferable. we made an effort to reduce type i error using glm by fitting the q matrix, and by applying correction for multiple testing. even though only few significant polymorphisms were identified using mlm, those were co-located in clusters of significantly associated polymorphisms identified by using glm.

candidate genes for seedling root traits
for the mlm analysis, gene model grmzm <dig> contained two of the significant markers for seedling root trait srl. this candidate gene is expressed throughout seedling development  <cit> . it should be noted that these expression information is based on b <dig>  and variation in transcriptome profiles between multiple inbred lines has been reported  <cit> . the gene model codes for three putative protein products within maize zea cefd homolog <dig>  tpa: isopenicillin n epimerase isoform  <dig> and isoform  <dig>  no confirmed function of these proteins has been determined.

the most noticeable candidate gene identified within this study is grmzm2g <dig>  this gene model is located on chromosome  <dig> and contained  <dig> of  <dig> significant markers found for two traits, dia and sua. haplotype analysis for this gene was examined with two haplotypes being identified within this region of the genome. one haplotype was found significant for both dia and sua at p-values of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> respectively. this strengthens our findings at the individual snp level. throughout seedling development this gene model showed expression is detectable in both roots and shoots  <cit> . the candidate gene is predicted to code for a putative protein 1-phospatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase. a blast search identified homologues in two species, sorghum bicolor and setaria italica , with greater than 85% sequence identity. both species have hypothetical protein products with currently unknown function. a homologue in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  plays an important role in root tip growth. if the function of the respective maize gene is similar, this candidate gene could be a vital player in regulating root development.

gene models grmzm2g <dig> and grmzm2g <dig> contained significant snps for multiple traits. blast results for grmzm2g <dig> cdna identified both sorghum bicolor, bamboo, and setaria italica with greater than 85% sequence identity, as was previously noted for garmzm2g <dig>  results from a blast of grmzm2g <dig> cdna revealed 100% identity with maize gene cef <dig>  which codes for an aspartate aminotransferase  superfamily  gene of pyridoxal phosphate -dependent enzymes. no phenotypes have been linked to this putative gene and protein product. expression of these genes was detected at v <dig> stage in the primary root in b <dig>  <cit> . these genes could play an active role in root development, especially at seedling growth stage.

wild type alleles of root development genes rtcl, rth <dig>  rum <dig>  and rul <dig> were studied with regard to their impact on seedling root trait expression using a candidate gene-based association mapping approach  <cit> . snps within these genes among the  <dig> inbred lines used as a mapping population were found to be associated with both root traits rdw and trl. in our study, rum <dig> was putatively detected by a linked significant snp. no snps within the remaining genic regions were significantly associated in this study. we used a candidate gene-based association mapping approach for those same four candidate genes in our population to determine, whether any snp in these regions would show significance due to a less stringent multiple testing threshold. nevertheless, we did not find significant snps within these root development genes. most lines used for the previous association panel  <cit>  were different from those in our panel, which would affect the significance of snps within those specific genes. in the previous study, sanger sequencing was used, which resulted in almost complete information of polymorphic sites within above mentioned candidate genes, giving much finer resolution within these specific genic regions. the same polymorphisms were likely not included within the current imputed gbs data due to different alleles being found in the different populations  <cit> . these differences in allele frequencies could lead to more or fewer loci being polymorphic within these genic regions. for example in the previous study for root gene rtcl,  <dig> polymorphisms were detected. in our population only five snps were present within this region. due to these discrepancies in allelic frequencies between populations, it can be expected that results can be inconsistent between association studies in different panels  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the putative snps identified within the current study might aid in selecting lines with these particular phenotypic root characteristics. respective snps can be used to breed for specific root types under various environmental conditions, thus enabling use of maize root architecture information as part of a selection strategy. the idea of an ideal root architecture or root ideotype has been presented  <cit> . ideotypes such as “steep, deep, and cheap” roots  <cit> , or deeper roots with vigorous lateral root growth, may increase nitrogen uptake efficiency under low n conditions  <cit> . other root traits that might play a pivotal role in increasing nutrient uptake efficiency include seminal root length and number, lateral root length and number, and root distribution. due to the extensive resource requirements needed to study adult plant roots, being able to connect seedling root traits to adult plant traits would be beneficial. understanding consistent relationships between seedling and adult root architectural traits would enable selection at the seedling level, and is addressed in ongoing research.
