BACKGROUND
aspergillus niger is a ubiquitous filamentous fungus. according to its saprophytic lifestyle, a. niger is capable of secreting large amounts of various plant polysaccharide degrading enzymes. its naturally high secretion capacity has long been exploited in industrial biotechnology for the production of homologous and heterologous proteins as well as organic acids
 <cit> . many of its products have acquired the gras status, meaning that they are generally considered as safe food ingredients
 <cit> . however, besides its positive economic relevance as an industrial workhorse, a. niger is a common storage mold causing spoilage of agricultural goods and contamination of food and feedstocks with mycotoxins
 <cit> . although to a much lesser extent than other species of its genus, a. niger is an opportunistic pathogen, which can cause invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients
 <cit> .

a. niger is exclusively known to propagate via an asexual life cycle, which finally leads to the formation of black airborne mitotic spores. core genes involved in signal transduction and conidiophore development in the model fungus a. nidulans <cit>  have also been identified in a. niger <cit> , suggesting that the regulation of asexual development is conserved. the first step in conidiophore development is the activation of the transcriptional regulator brla, which induces the expression of a number of conidiation-specific genes. brla expression is autoregulated, resulting in a strong accumulation of its mrna during asexual development
 <cit> . although most conidiation studies are performed at a substrate/air interface, conidiation can also be induced in submerged cultures by nutrient limitation such as severe carbon limitation
 <cit> . under these conditions, carbon from endogenous resources becomes mobilized to fuel maintenance and self-propagation. consequently, the fungal mycelium becomes highly heterogeneous, bearing empty compartments and those that are committed to conidiation
 <cit> . while this strategy is beneficial for self-propagation and the exploitation of new substrate sources during saprophytic growth, it may result in a decrease of the active biomass fraction during carbon-limited industrial production processes.

only a few studies have been conducted to investigate different aspects of aging carbon-limited fungal cultures. as discussed in the review by white et al. <cit> , most of them focus on physiological and morphological aspects. the generic term autolysis has been frequently used to summarize the involved processes. hallmarks of autolysis are biomass decline, hyphal fragmentation, release of ammonia and increased extracellular hydrolase activity
 <cit> . for different fungal species, the involvement of hydrolases, especially chitinases and glucanases but also proteases has been investigated in great detail
 <cit> . an early and strong transcriptional induction in response to carbon starvation was shown in a. nidualns for the two hydrolases chib and naga, which have been intensively studied because of their role in the degradation of the cell wall component chitin
 <cit> . in addition to physiological and biochemical hallmarks of aging fungal cultures, several approaches have been developed to quantify the decreasing fraction of active hyphal compartments in aging mycelium by  automated image analysis
 <cit> .

an increasing number of publications highlights the importance of programmed cell death  in aging fungal cultures
 <cit> . pcd is generally classified into three types, which are referred to as apoptosis , autophagy  and necrosis 
 <cit> . their physiological roles are very complex and their relationships are not completely understood. while apoptosis and necrosis are explicitly associated with cell death, autophagy is also a normal physiological process important for cellular homeostasis by lysosomal degradation and recycling. the cellular functions of autophagy have been proposed to exert roles that are both causative of and protective against cell death
 <cit> .

improving our understanding of processes induced by carbon starvation and their dynamic interactions is important to further optimize industrial production processes. the aim of this study is to provide a system-wide description of the carbon starvation response of the filamentous fungus a. niger. submerged carbon-limited bioreactor batch cultures were performed and maintained starving up to six days after carbon depletion. in addition to describing the physiology and morphology, we analyzed the secretome and established genome-wide transcriptional profiles for three distinct starvation phases. besides specifically dissecting expression data for groups of selected genes including proteases, chitinases and glucanases, we performed enrichment analysis to dissect the complex transcriptional changes.

our investigation shows that carbon starvation in submerged cultures caused complex morphological changes and cellular differentiation including emergence of empty hyphal ghosts, secondary growth of thin non-branching filaments on the expense of older hyphal compartments and formation of conidiating structures. concomitantly, autophagy and conidiation pathway genes were clearly induced on the transcriptional level. we propose that metabolic adaptation to carbon starvation is mediated by autophagy and that cell death rather than hydrolytic weakening of the fungal cell wall can be considered a hallmark of aging carbon starved a. niger cultures.

RESULTS
physiology of carbon starved cultures
the a. niger wild type strain n402
 <cit>  was cultivated under controlled conditions in bioreactors to study its response to carbon starvation during prolonged submerged batch cultivation . the defined medium had a ph of  <dig> and was balanced such, that carbon  was the growth limiting nutrient. during exponential growth , ph  <dig> was maintained by alkaline addition , which linearly correlated with the biomass accumulation and was previously shown to reflect ammonium uptake during balanced growth on minimal medium
 <cit> . the end of the exponential growth phase was detected by an increase of the dissolved oxygen signal  and depletion of the carbon source was confirmed by measurements of maltose and glucose concentrations . the corresponding time point  was used to synchronize replicate cultures insuring that samples were taken from equivalent physiological phases. the biomass concentration peaked at 5g·kg− <dig> culture broth .

after maltose was exhausted, ph  <dig> was maintained by acid addition . the metabolic activity of the culture decreased in response to the lack of an easily accessible carbon and energy source as indicated by the co <dig> production and o2consumption rates . protease activity rapidly increased and was already detected within  <dig> hours after maltose depletion. during the later starvation phase , the protease activity remained constant; however, extracellular protein levels doubled within  <dig> hours after carbon depletion and remained constant thereafter . towards the end of the starvation phase, the cell mass decreased by nearly 60% . importantly, co <dig> and o <dig> levels in the exhaust gas indicated that the cultures were still metabolically active, even  <dig> hours after depletion of the carbon source .

morphological differentiation during carbon starvation
throughout the entire cultivation, a. niger displayed a dispersed morphology. during exponential growth, the mycelium remained intact and no damaged or empty hyphae were observed . early after depletion of maltose and onset of starvation, empty hyphal compartments emerged and the diameter of growing hyphae significantly decreased . throughout prolonged starvation, the fraction of empty hyphal compartments increased, but the cell wall exoskeleton appeared to remain intact . fragmented, broken hyphal ghosts were rarely observed. outgrowing thin filaments emerged, which continued elongating in a non-branching manner. towards the later starvation phases , morphologically crippled asexual reproductive structures appeared which resembled low-density conidiophores without clearly distinguishable phialides and metulae . even  <dig> hours after exhaustion of the carbon source, surviving compartments were present, which often showed outgrowing hyphae bearing asexual reproductive structures . secondary growth of thin hyphae was even observed within empty hyphal ghosts .

similar to our results, morphological data from a. oryzae <cit>  indicate a sharp transition between thick and thin compartments  in response to carbon starvation, suggesting that hyphal diameters can be used to distinguish populations of old and young hyphae formed during primary growth on the supplied carbon source and secondary growth fueled by carbon recycling, respectively. to visualize the transition dynamics from thick  to thin  hyphae in response to carbon starvation, an image analysis algorithm was developed to analyze hyphal diameter distributions of the cytoplasm filled mycelial fraction. microscopic pictures from samples of various cultivation time points were analyzed and probability density curves were plotted for the distributions of hyphal diameters . diameters from exponentially growing hyphae resembled a normal distribution with a mean of approximately  <dig> μm. in response to carbon starvation, a second population of thinner hyphae with a mean diameter of approximately  <dig> μm emerged. throughout the course of starvation, there was a gradual transition from thick  to thin  hyphae for the cytoplasm filled fraction, suggesting that compartments of older hyphae originating from the exponential growth phase gradually underwent cell death and became empty while a new population of thin hyphae started to grow on the expense of dying compartments.

transcriptomic response to carbon starvation
to follow transcriptomic changes during carbon starvation, total rna was extracted from biomass harvested at different time points during batch cultivation. although difficulties to isolate intact rna from aging cultures were reported for a. nidulans <cit> , we could isolate total rna of high quality from samples up to  <dig> hours after depletion of the sole carbon source, as assessed by lab on chip quality control  and northern analysis . transient expression levels of the gamma-actin encoding gene acta , the glycosyl hydrolase naga  and the regulator of asexual sporulation brla  are exemplarily shown in figure
1c. while naga can be considered an early response gene whose expression peaked  <dig> hours after exponential growth, brla expression was induced later and remained constant after reaching a plateau at  <dig> hours of carbon starvation. expression levels of acta decreased considerably after exponential growth but remained constant during later cultivation phases.

rna samples from four distinct cultivation phases were subjected to genome-wide transcriptional profiling: exponential growth phase,  <dig> hours ,  <dig> hours  and  <dig> hours  post carbon depletion. differentially expressed genes were identified by a moderated t-test
 <cit>  applying a critical fdr q-value of  <dig> . compared to the exponential growth phase,  <dig>  of totally  <dig>  genes  were identified as differentially expressed during at least one of the starvation time points .  <dig>  genes were conjointly upregulated, whereas  <dig>  genes were conjointly downregulated during carbon starvation . enrichment analyses using gene ontology 
 <cit> , pfam domain
 <cit>  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes 
 <cit>  pathway annotations were performed to uncover major transcriptional trends. for a. niger, all three annotations are based on computational inference. among them, go annotation can be considered to have the best quality because it was inferred from the computationally and manually curated go annotation of the closely related species a. nidulans <cit> .

the go enrichment results are summarized in figure
 <dig> . they cover 20%  and 33%  of all up- and downregulated genes, respectively. among the genes induced under carbon starvation, common and time-dependent overrepresentation of go terms was observed. while go terms related to e.g. catabolic  pathway, fatty acid oxidation and trehalose catabolism) and reproductive  processes were generally enriched, other processes responded in a time-dependent manner constituting early, intermediate or late responses. among the transiently enriched processes were non-glycolytic fermentation and pcd , cell wall organization , regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter  as well as reactive oxygen metabolism . in contrast to the upregulated genes, the downregulated gene sets did not display any time-dependent differences with respect to the significantly overrepresented go terms. the commonly downregulated processes included transcription from rna polymerase i promoter, ribosome biogenesis, translation, secretion and respiration.

pfam domain and kegg pathway enrichment results are summarized in the supplemental data . although the three annotations have different sources, structures and levels of complexity, the individual enrichment results confirm each other. only in a few cases, pfam domain and kegg pathway enrichment analyses provided additional information beyond the go enrichment results. for example, among the upregulated genes at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  those having a putative sugar transporter domain  were strongly enriched . in consideration of the severe carbon limitation, it can be assumed that these predicted sugar transporters comprise high-affinity sugar transporters. indeed, msta  and mstf  encoding two high-affinity sugar/h+symporters
 <cit>  were significantly upregulated at day  <dig> and  <dig> as well as day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. furthermore, the cytochrome p <dig> domain  was significantly enriched among genes upregulated at day  <dig>  the biochemical roles of the majority of cytochromes p <dig> are unknown but many are expected to be involved e.g. in the formation of pigments, antioxidants and secondary metabolites
 <cit> . two of the  <dig> enriched cytochrome p <dig> domain proteins are physically associated with distinct  secondary metabolite clusters, of which one is the fumonisin cluster
 <cit> . obviously, induction of the fumonisin cluster constitutes an early and orchestrated response to carbon starvation. transcript levels for  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted open reading frames were exclusively elevated at day  <dig>  including the putative transcription factor encoded by an01g <dig> .

in addition, pcd-associated genes were specifically overrepresented  during the early adaptive phase at day  <dig> of carbon starvation. the encoded proteins include two predicted metacaspases  and a poly polymerase homologue . four proteins sharing nacht domains combined with ankyrin or wd <dig> domain repeats  and three proteins with a nb-arc domain  were upregulated as well .

as implied by the enrichment results for both go and kegg pathway annotations, carbon starvation coordinately induced the expression of genes involved in autophagic processes. to date, more than  <dig> autophagy  genes have been identified for saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi
 <cit> ,  <dig> of which have a predicted orthologue in a. niger. all except one were detected as significantly upregulated during at least one of the starvation time points . the expression level of atg <dig> , encoding a lipid-conjugated ubiquitin-like protein that controls the expansion of pre-autophagosomes
 <cit> , was the highest among all atg genes. at day  <dig> it reached 75% of the actin expression level during exponential growth. despite this concerted induction during carbon starvation, it is clearly evident from the expression data that autophagic processes also play an important role during exponential growth, because atg gene expression levels ranged from  <dig> %  to 24%  when compared with the actin gene expression level .

the induction of hydrolases, including proteases and glycosyl hydrolases, has been proposed as a key event in aging fungal cultures
 <cit> . during carbon starvation, glycosyl hydrolases are involved in both the liberation of carbon from fungal cell wall polymers and cell wall remodeling. we identified those upregulated genes that putatively encode glycosyl hydrolases active on fungal cell wall polymers such as chitin, glucan and mannan  by mining publicly accessible data
 <cit> . the expression profiles allow a general classification into early and late response genes. in agreement with literature
 <cit> , the chitinolytic genes chib  and naga  were among the highest induced early response genes. the rapid transient induction of naga as shown by northern analysis  exemplarily corroborates the microarray data. in addition to the chitinolytic hydrolases, the group of intensely induced early response hydrolases includes the α-glucanase agnb , multiple β-glucanases and one mannanase. besides a number of glycosyl hydrolases that were only marginally induced during the later time points, the chitinases cfci  and ctcb  showed strong specific induction during the two later time points. it is thus tempting to speculate that cfci and ctcb are rather involved in cell wall remodeling during asexual development than liberation of carbon from cell wall polymers.

the second group of hydrolases, namely proteases, fulfills diverse physiological functions ranging from signaling to nutrient recycling. in accordance to the rapidly increasing extracellular protease activity after carbon depletion , an early transcriptional induction of extracellular proteases was observed . compared to exponential growth, the expression levels of the two major secreted proteases pepa and pepb <cit>  were increased by more than  <dig> fold at day  <dig>  additionally, roughly  <dig> further predicted secreted proteases were induced during carbon starvation with transcript level changes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  in agreement, expression of the main transcriptional regulator of proteases prtt

secretomic response to carbon starvation
to identify extracellular hydrolases secreted at various cultivation time points, mass spectrometric analyses of tryptically digested proteins precipitated from culture filtrates were performed. neither chitin, α-glucan nor mannan active hydrolases were detected in the culture broth during exponential growth . in agreement to its high transcript levels during carbon starvation, naga  was the most abundant extracellular hydrolase involved in chitin degradation at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, the chitinase chib was, in contrast to its strong transcriptional upregulation, only marginally detected in filtrates at day  <dig>  both observations correspond well to the presence and absence of predicted signal peptide sequences for naga and chib, respectively. interestingly, chib of a. niger showed only low extracellular abundance, whereas the a. nidulans chib  was identified as the major extracellular autolytic chitinase during carbon starvation
 <cit> . the absence of chib in the culture broth of a. niger could explain why hyphal ghosts remained intact but were reported to fragment in aging cultures of a. nidulans <cit> . in concordance with its expression profile, the α-glucanase agnb  was detected extracellularly at day  <dig> and  <dig>  while geld  was the only reliably detected β-glucanase during exponential growth, various β-glucanases with predicted signal peptide sequences were detected at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of carbon starvation. among the predicted mannanases, only an04g <dig> was reliably detected in filtrates at later time points .

in agreement with increasing extracellular protease activity and expression profiles, a number of proteases with predicted signal peptide sequences were identified in culture filtrates of day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  among them, pepa , the major extracellular protease
 <cit> , was most abundant. however, although pepb  has a predicted signal peptide sequence and showed strong transcriptional induction, it was not detected in culture filtrates. transcriptionally induced proteases lacking predicted signal peptide sequences were not detected in culture filtrates, with the only exception of an01g <dig>  similar results have been previously reported for a. niger by braaksma et al. <cit> , who proposed that the high extracellular abundance of an01g <dig> is likely a result of non-classical secretion rather than lysis.

the secretome during starvation conditions was clearly enriched by an additional group of proteins with strong similarity to phospholipases. together the four putative phospholipases, an16g <dig>  an09g <dig>  an01g <dig> and an02g <dig> constituted on average about 7% of all detected extracellular proteins during day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all except an02g <dig> were transcriptionally induced during carbon starvation. this high abundance of predicted phospholipases during carbon starvation might be indicative for a role of membrane lipids as alternative carbon source during secondary growth. the complete list of identified extracellular proteins is given in additional file

discussion
the present study is the first system-wide description of the carbon starvation response in a filamentous fungus. the application of bioreactor technology allowed highly reproducible culture conditions and physiological synchronization of replicate batch cultures. the use of minimal medium with maltose as the sole limiting nutrient, constant ph, sufficient aeration and homogeneously dispersed mycelial biomass reduced biological and technical variations to a minimum and allowed us to highlight those differences in gene expression, which were in direct relation to carbon starvation.

submerged growth is fundamentally different from the natural fungal life style. fungi experience spatio-temporal gradients of various ambient factors such as nutrients, temperature and ph in their natural habitats. these gradients lead to heterogenity within the fungal colony. several studies have investigated this heterogeneity during growth on agar plates and have characterized differential concentric zones with respect to gene expression and protein secretion
 <cit> . recently, this heterogeneity has even been shown for microcolonies  in liquid shaken cultures of a. niger <cit> . in an ideally mixed bioreactor, all dispersed hyphae experience identical environmental conditions and temporal profiles can be monitored and controlled by process parameters. accordingly, many evolutionary acquired traits contributing to the natural fungal life style such as the formation of substrate exploring hyphae, secretion of certain hydrolases, cell death and conidiation are dispensable during industrial processes and might even negatively affect production yields.

in this study a. niger showed general hallmarks of autolysis
 <cit>  during prolonged carbon starvation. however, in contrast to a. nidulans <cit> , a. niger hyphae did not undergo substantial fragmentation. while an increasing number of hyphal compartments became empty after carbon depletion, microscopic analysis showed that hyphal cell wall skeletons remained mainly intact. thus disintegration of aging mycelia appears rather to be initiated by intracellular activities such as cell death and/or endogenous recycling of neighboring compartments leading to empty hyphal ghosts than by extracellular hydrolysis of fungal cell walls . this assumption is supported by studies in a. nidulans, where autolytic fragmentation of hyphae and cell death were described as simultaneous but independently regulated processes
 <cit> . while deletion of the major carbon catabolite repressor crea in a. nidulans resulted in increased hydrolase activities and mycelial fragmentation during carbon starvation, the viability of a. nidulans was not affected
 <cit> . consistently, we observed hyphal fragmentation and enhanced biomass decline in bioreactor cultures during the starvation phase only when the ph control was switched-off leading to an elevated ph of approximately  <dig>  towards the end of cultivation . we thus propose that hydrolytic weakening of the fungal cell wall and hyphal fragmentation is a secondary effect, which occurs after initial cell death events and only under favorable conditions .

in flow chamber experiments with a. oryzae, pollack et al. <cit>  followed single hyphae and studied their response to glucose depletion. similar to our results, they observed secondary growth fueled by carbon recycling, which was morphologically characterized by the formation of hyphae with significantly reduced diameters. for a. niger and a. oryzae <cit>  hyphal diameters were shown to linearly correlate with the specific growth rate, hence the reduction of hyphal diameters reflects the slow rate of secondary growth during the starvation phase. focusing on non-empty compartments, we analyzed hyphal population dynamics from statistically valid sample sizes for different cultivation time points . our data showed that older hyphae with larger diameters grown during carbon-sufficient conditions gradually became empty, giving rise to a new population of thinner hyphae. carbon for this secondary phase of growth might have been liberated from extra- and/or intracellular sources. in agreement with another study of a. niger <cit> , our secretomic data revealed that the relative contribution of lysis was very limited, even under starvation conditions . compared to exponential growth, no relative accumulation of proteins without predicted signal peptide sequences was observed in culture filtrates. however, because these results could also be explained by an equilibrium between proteolytic degradation and leakage of cytoplasmic proteins, it still remains to be shown whether intracellular resources are endogenously recycled by neighboring compartments or first leak into the culture broth where they are subsequently taken up by surviving compartments .

one process known to be important for endogenous recycling of cytoplasmic content in eukaryotes is macroautophagy. in filamentous fungi, it is thought to play an important role in nutrient trafficking along the hyphal network promoting foraging of substrate exploring hyphae and conidiation
 <cit> . however, besides endogenous recycling of nutrients, autophagy in general is clearly associated with cell death and is discussed to have protective roles related to the degradation of e.g. damaged mitochondria or unfolded proteins
 <cit>  . it is strongly evident from our transcriptomic data that the induction of autophagic processes is a hallmark of carbon-starved aging fungal cultures. to which extend autophagic processes play a role in the protection against apoptotic/necrotic pcd, endogenous recycling and autophagic pcd remains to be shown in future studies.

the go enrichment showed a joint downregulation of general protein biosynthesis and secretion pathways during carbon starvation. however, the extracellular accumulation of certain proteins with predicted signal peptide sequences including proteases, glycosyl hydrolases and phospholipases indicates a specification of those pathways which might be related to the emergence of the second population of thin poorly branching hyphae. this phenomenum has been observed, for example, during nitrogen starving surface cultures of phanerochaete chrysosporium for which thin hyphae rather than thick hyphae have been shown to secrete manganese peroxidase
 <cit> .

the liberation of carbon from polymers such as fungal cell wall carbohydrates and secreted proteins is indicated by increased expression of glycosyl hydrolases and proteases as well as by increased extracellular protease activity. strikingly, the major secreted protease pepa
 <cit>  was the second most abundant extracellular protein during carbon starvation, which was only excelled by protein levels of the maltose-induced alpha-glucosidae glaa  secreted during exponential growth. although transcripts of the chib/naga chitinolytic system accumulated simultaneously during carbon starvation as described previously for a. nidulans <cit> , only naga could be identified extracellularly in high relative abundances. while the low relative abundance of chib in filtrates from day  <dig> is in agreement with the absence of a predicted signal peptide sequence, it conflicts with results obtained in a. nidulans <cit> , where it was identified as the major extracellular autolytic chitinase. interestingly, despite its extracellular abundance, also a. nidulans chib lacks a signal peptide prediction. whether a. nidulans chib is released by non-classical secretion or lysis remains to be shown. it is tempting to speculate that cell wall degrading hydrolases lacking a signal peptide sequence are part of the fungal pcd program and accumulate intracellularly in dying compartments to be subsequently released upon cell death for recycling of the remaining hyphal ghost. in view of the natural emerse growth of fungi, this could be a successful strategy for survival - released hydrolases will remain localized to hyphal ghosts and not become diluted as under submerged conditions. future studies will be necessary to elucidate whether intracellular localization, retention at the cell wall, protein instability or inefficient translation explain the low abundance of chib in filtrates of a. niger.

carbon starvation provoked asexual reproduction of a. niger, which was clearly evident by the formation of condiospores  and by expression of respective conidiation-related genes . this elaborate developmental program requires liberation and recycling of carbon to proceed in aging batch cultures . increased heterogeneity and compartmentalization of the hyphal network resulting in empty, cryptically growing and conidiating compartments implies an ordered form of fungal cell death ensuring self-propagation to survive life-threatening starvation conditions. in a. nidulans it was shown that disruption of the flba gene, encoding a regulator of g-protein signaling acting upstream of brla, resulted in an enhanced autolytic phenotype
 <cit> . hence, vegetative growth, autolysis and conidiation are closely interwoven processes and future factorial genome-wide transcriptomic studies of wild-type and developmental mutants will allow deconstruction of fungal cell death and its link to developmental processes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comprehensive description of the carbon starvation response of the filamentous fungus a. niger during submerged cultivation. the impact of secondary growth by carbon recycling was indicated by hyphal population dynamics illustrating a gradual transition from old to young hyphae. the induction of autophagic and reproductive processes was clearly evident by major genome-wide transcriptional trends. hydrolases with strong transcriptional induction during carbon starvation include chib, naga, agnb, pepa and pepb. importantly, fragmentation of empty hyphal ghosts was not observed, thus constituting direct evidence that autolysis in aging submerged cultures of a. niger is rather initiated by cell death than by hydrolytic weakening and fragmentation of cell walls.
