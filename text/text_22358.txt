BACKGROUND
pathogen attacks from fungi  <cit> , viruses  <cit> , nematodes  <cit>  or bacteria  <cit> , compelled plants to prevent damages by engaging an “arms race” with these organisms. therefore, plants have developed a battery of defense mechanisms involving  pti  triggered by pamp   <cit>  and  eti  triggered by effectors leading to hypersensitive response . therefore, constant evolution leading to novel mechanisms is crucial for plant defense processes as well as adaptation to biotic stresses. the most studied disease resistance proteins encoding genes  or genes involved in disease resistance pathways are nucleotide-binding-sites   <cit> , leucine-rich repeats   <cit> , toll-interleukine <dig> receptors , wrky transcription factors  <cit> , lysine motif  families  <cit> , and protein kinase families   <cit> . r-genes can then be functionally classified into five distinct groups consisting in cnl , tnl , rlp , rlk , and rga  classes  <cit> . lrr-rlk, lrr, lysm, lysm-kinase act as pattern-recognition receptors  involved in the pti pathway, while nbs-lrr commonly responds in the frame of the eti pathway  <cit> . finally, wrky and protein-kinases, associated with protein domains encoded by r-genes , can also be activated by prrs in disease resistance pathways  <cit> .

r-genes have been reported to be ancient and conserved genes that have been detected in gymnosperms, plants and animals to ensure immunity  <cit> . however, comparative genomic analyses have shown that r-genes are associated with a great structural diversity in vertebrates and plants. for example, the presence of tir domains in conifers and mosses indicated that tir may represent an ancestral r-gene family with shared functionality with their mammalian or insect homologues regarding innate immunity  <cit> . tir genes typically expanded in eudicot genomes, while they have been reported to be absent  in grass genomes  <cit> . moreover, tandem and segmental duplications have been reported as a source of structural plasticity of nbs-lrr genes in plant genomes  <cit> . furthermore, pav  polymorphisms often exist in a population or between species  <cit> . overall, small-scale studies  have suggested r-genes as one of the most plastic gene family in plants associated with intense structural shuffling in the course of evolution leading to synteny erosion or alternatively loss  <cit> . for example, evolutionary investigations of r-genes in arabidopsis and rice have been conducted suggesting contrasted amplification of tnl and cnl families as well as clusterization of nbs-lrrs via segmental and tandem duplications or ectopic gene conversions  <cit> .

few studies have investigated the conservation of r-genes across a large set of plant species and at the whole-genome level. genome sequences from flowering plants that are derived from a common ancestor  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  are increasingly available in the public domain for evolutionary studies. recent paleohistorical studies demonstrated that modern grass genomes, including panicoideae , ehrhartoideae , and pooideae , were shaped from n =  <dig> to  <dig> ancestral grass karyotypes  containing a minimal set of  <dig> ordered protogenes with a minimum physical size of  <dig> mb  <cit>  through whole-genome duplication  and ancestral chromosome fusion events. likewise, the recent comparison of numerous eudicot genomes , including grape , poplar  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , soybean glycine max;  <cit> , and cacao , revealed that modern eudicot genomes derived from an n =  <dig> ancestor that went through a paleohexaploidization event to reach a n =  <dig> intermediate followed by numerous lineage-specific wgds and chromosome fusion events  <cit> . during the last  <dig> to  <dig> million years of evolution, the protein-coding gene families have been then shaped by various gene duplication mechanisms, including wgds , segmental duplications, and tandem duplications. it is now well established that all modern diploid plant species are highly shuffled paleopolyploids  <cit> .

duplication  were proposed as the major mechanisms driving r-genes family expansion or contraction from their traceable ancestral copies  <cit> . however, a systematic and detailed study of the paleohistorical evolution of r-genes across plant subfamilies including rosids species , and grasses  is still lacking. particularly, how r-genes have behaved following polyploidization events is not well established. such a precise investigation of the paleohistory of r-genes during the last  <dig> million years of evolution will unravel precise mechanisms that lead to the reduced conservation of r-genes observed between modern plant species.

RESULTS
disease resistance gene mapping, conservation and evolutionary patterns
to identify the largest set of plant r-genes, three complementary methods  were combined  consisting in  the detection of pfam  <cit>  domains,  the exploitation of public genome annotations, and  the use of the plant resistance gene database, prgdb . the integration of the three previous approaches allowed to construct a non-redundant set of putative r-genes in the plant species considered in this study . based on the genome annotation approach,  <dig> r-genes were identified in monocots, and  <dig> in eudicots, corresponding to a total set of  <dig> plant r-genes . regarding the pfam domain identification procedure,  <dig> sequences in monocots and  <dig> in eudicot species were identified, corresponding to  <dig> putative r-genes sequences in total . finally, the prgdb aligned on the  <dig> genome sequences investigated unraveled  <dig> sequences in monocots and  <dig> sequences in eudicot species. these three complementary methods lead us to deliver the most complete and non-redundant list in angiosperms consisting in  <dig> r-genes sequences,  <dig> for the monocots and  <dig> for the eudicots . the identified r-genes families deriving from the annotation, pfam and prgdb approaches are detailed in table  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  showing that the total number of non-redundant r-genes in plants is close to the dataset obtained with the pfam detection approach, suggesting that such method is the most appropriate in delivering the largest and most complete set of r-genes in any genomic sequence of interest.

the conservation of r-genes between genomes was then investigated using rice and grape as reference genomes respectively for monocots and eudicots as they represent the most closely related modern genome structures of the reconstructed plant ancestral karyotypes  <cit> . the  <dig> rice r-gene sequences were aligned against the three other monocot species available, i.e. sorghum, brachypodium and maize. similarly, the  <dig> grape r-genes sequences were aligned against the eight eudicot species investigated .  <dig> orthologous r-genes were identified in sorghum corresponding to  <dig> % of the reference dataset . similarly,  <dig> orthologous r-genes were found in maize  and  <dig> in brachypodium . this result suggests that r-genes may appear as more conserved than the total protein-coding genes, with respectively  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of rice orthologous r-genes characterized in sorghum, maize and brachypodium compared to  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of overall annotated protein-coding genes conservation observed for the same species . however, if the protein kinase family is excluded, as it consists in the largest  one compared to the six others , the synteny conservation observed for r-genes is similar to one observed for the total annotated protein-coding genes. the r-genes synteny  at the chromosome level between grasses is illustrated as figure 1a. in contrast to grasses, in eudicot species r-genes are significantly less conserved than the annotated protein-coding genes  with  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % orthologous r-genes identified in arabidopsis, poplar, soybean, apple, lotus, strawberry, and cacao compared to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for the conservation of total protein-coding genes for the same species . this result may suggest a reduced syntenic conservation of r-genes in eudicots compared to monocots.

r-genes were classified into seven distinct groups, according to their specific encoded protein domains . in monocots, we identified  <dig> lrr,  <dig> nbs,  <dig> tir,  <dig> lysm,  <dig> wrky,  <dig> protein-kinases, and  <dig> rg. in eudicots,  <dig> lrr,  <dig> nbs,  <dig> tir,  <dig> lysm,  <dig> wrky,  <dig> protein-kinases, and  <dig> rg were characterized. the distribution of the r-domain repertoire excluding pkinases in the  <dig> plant species investigated is illustrated as figure 1b with a color code that illuminates the six different r-domains . regarding the six different r-domains investigated, lrr and nbs are more abundant in the investigated plant genomes . lrr and nbs consist in, on average, more than 50% and 20% of detected r-genes in both eudicots and monocots respectively. few wrky domains were detected in plants . however, the number of tir domains appeared much abundant in eudicots than the monocot species  as previously reported  <cit> , which may indicated a specific amplification of such domain during rosids paleohistory. the distribution of r-gene families structured into pti , eti , other pattern recognition receptors  divided into r-domains combinations  and genes involved in disease resistance pathway  is available as additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the observed distribution of r-gene families in the investigated species from the more abundant is r-pathway  > pti  > r-combination  > eti .

in order to reconstruct the ancestral r-genes repertoire in plants, we used the recently reconstructed ancestral monocot  and eudicot  karyotypes to investigate the r-genes evolutionary dynamic. in figure 1c, the evolutionary scenario of the modern grass genomes deriving from a n =  <dig> ancestor is illustrated  <cit> . circular distributions illuminated the conservation rate of r-genes families excluding pkinases  and their abundances within the different species . in the four grasses, the distribution of r-domains appeared very similar, except for rg, more abundant in brachypodium compared to the other grasses investigated . this phenomenon can simply be explained by the differences in rga annotation and functional characterization efforts in the different species investigated. finally, wrky appeared less abundant in rice compared with the other grasses . according to the reconstructed five protochromosomes, dating back to ~50- <dig> mya before the speciation of the four modern species investigated , we were able to reconstruct a minimal founder  pool of  <dig> ancestral r-domains consisting in  <dig> lrr,  <dig> nbs,  <dig> tir,  <dig> lysm,  <dig> wrky, and  <dig> rg . based on the same strategy, the evolutionary scenario of the eudicots has been used to unravel a minimal founder pool of  <dig> r-genes . in order to understand in more details the evolution of the major pti/eti families, we have reconstructed their ancestral pools. the results suggests that pti genes content in the ancestors are significantly higher than observed in each modern species , while the eti genes content is lower in ancestors compared to modern species . this result may suggest an opposite evolutionary trend between pti and eti families that are respectively lost and gained in the course of evolution.

r-genes plasticity in response to duplication events
we wanted to investigate the impact of polyploidy  in shaping the modern r-genes repertoire deriving from a founder pool of  <dig>  and  <dig>  r-genes for respectively the grasses and rosids. while massive duplicated gene deletion in the course of evolution following wgd has been reported in the literature  <cit> , then leading to orthologous dominant  and sensitive  blocks, the particular evolutionary fate of r-genes in response of such diploidization phenomenon is still not well established. to understand the r-genes family plasticity in response to wgds, we used monocots as a model system to investigate the retention of r-genes  in duplicated fragment pairs . it has been shown that protein-coding genes behave differently in response to this diploidization process. diploidization resistant genes  are mainly transcription factors , transcription regulators  as well as mirnas to a less extent, whereas the remaining gene families are considered as diploidization sensitive in returning to a singleton status after wgds via selective gene deletion between dominant and sensitive chromosomal blocks  <cit> . at the whole genome level, we observed that only ~5%  ancestral r-genes mapped on the grass ancestor  were co-retained , a much lower rate than the one reported for transcription factors  as well as mirna genes with up to 50% of observed co-retention of ancestral duplicates  <cit> . therefore, the observed lower co-retention of ancestral paralogous r-genes may suggest that r-genes act as diploidization sensitive genes in returning to a singleton status after wgd. however, for  <dig> %  duplicated chromosome pairs, the previous characterized deletion of the diploidization sensitive r-genes does not follows the subgenome dominance hypothesis  in deriving dominant and sensitive blocks  <cit> . instead, we observed that r-genes retention after wgd is equally distributed between ancestral chromosome pairs a8/ <dig>  a11/a <dig>  a2/a <dig>  a3/a <dig>  and a3/a <dig>  in the four grass species. intriguingly, after the recent wgd in maize, for  <dig> %  of the duplicated chromosomes, r-genes deletion was partitioned between the paralogous pairs .

such observed absence in r-genes deletion partitioning in grasses between ancestral duplicated chromosomes may be due to r-gene clusters identified as more abundant in ancestral sensitive chromosomes compared to dominant chromosomal compartment . for example, between a <dig>  and a <dig> , there is no cluster located in the a <dig> in contrast to seven genes in three clusters on a <dig>  while between a <dig>  and a <dig>  more clusters in the a <dig>  do not reverse or reduce the reported dominance of a <dig> . in contrast, r-genes clusters in maize did not affected the observed bias retention of duplicated r-genes between paralogous fragments excluding for a <dig> , a <dig> , a <dig>  and a <dig> ; figure 2a , additional file 1: table s <dig>  this result may indicate that the random deletion of r-genes after wgd, not following the known subgenome dominance rule for the ancestral tetraploidization, may be a consequence of the high plasticity of such gene family evolving particularly in local tandem duplications  that may have compensated the ancestral biased deletion of duplicates in known sensitive subgenomes in the course of evolution. however, for the recent wgd in maize dating back to  <dig> mya, tandem duplications or clusters can’t offset the dominance/sensitivity effect in such short period of time. thus, our data led to the hypothesis that r-genes, identified as diploidization sensitive genes, may have followed the subgenome dominance hypothesis that was compensate in the course of history by a reshuffling return flow consisting in local tandem duplications, enriching sensitive genomic compartments in r-genes content.

r-genes plasticity via clusterization and transposition mechanisms
while r-genes have been reported to be clustered in grass chromosomes  <cit>  based on few species or loci investigated, a large-scale investigation of this phenomenon is still lacking in monocots and dicots. the structural definition of a r-gene cluster was considered following a previous study where linked  r-genes were not interrupted by more than eight non-r-genes  <cit> . in additional file 1: table s <dig>  we reported that there are about 69% and 63% r-genes on average organized in clusters in monocots and eudicots respectively, suggesting that r-genes families expanded by lineage-specific tandem duplications leading to duplicated gene copy variants associated with high sequence similarities. surprisingly, in poplar for example, we detected only 32% of r-genes organized in clusters using the same strategy, then unraveling possible specific patterns of r-gene clusterization between species. the typology of the r-genes clusters differs between species then reinforcing the concept of a recent clusterization process with most  of them consisting in clusters of two locally duplicated r-genes, especially in maize , while the largest and rare cluster, made of six r-genes, was only observed in rice .

the particular evolution of r-genes via clusterization was highly dynamic through lineage-specific rearrangements leading to the observed conservation/erosion of r-genes colinearity between grasses, referenced as copy number variation  and presence/absence variation . the figure 3a illustrates an orthologous r-gene locus in grasses involving a  <dig> kb rice region on chromosome  <dig> , a  <dig> kb region on the brachypodium chromosome  <dig> , a  <dig> kb region of the sorghum chromosome  <dig> , and the two orthologous regions in maize on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  both with no r-gene annotated. this example illustrates the extreme structural variation in r-gene content between orthologous regions. on the two maize paralogous regions no r-gene were identified, while transposable elements  are found with high concentration . their presences suggest that tes may be involved in the loss of r-genes through illegitimate recombination. the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of this locus illustrates the plasticity of the r-gene family where a single ancestral r-gene is retained in the modern brachypodium and sorghum genomes but evolved into cnv in rice  and pav  in maize.

the figure 3b illustrates the retention of duplicated loci with 90% of sequence similarity in cacao, one locus with one r-gene , and the duplicated locus harboring two r-genes . we located precisely tsd  motifs and long terminal reverse duplication, suggesting tc06p <dig> as the acceptor site  and the duplicated region with two genes as the donor site . the acceptor site is characterized by a 7 kb fragmental deletion, which is located in the intergenic region of the donor site between tc03p <dig> and tc03p <dig> . the deletion of the intergenic fragment between the neighbor genes may have led to the read through of the orfs leading the two neighbor genes fused into a single one  in the course of evolution. these paralogous regions from cacao may then suggest duplication as a major process resulting in domain shuffling  between tandem duplicated r-genes.

such r-gene structural plasticity may also be driven by tes as we illustrated in the figure 3c with two tandem duplicated r-genes with about 80% of sequence similarity from the rice genome, i.e. os06g <dig>  and os06g <dig> . using ltr_finder  <cit> , we identified a 240 bp ancient ltrs flanking the os06g <dig> gene  as well as 5 bp tsd motifs associated with  <dig>  kb recent ltrs  flanking two transposase genes, i.e. os06g <dig> and os06g <dig>  we then proposed an evolutionary scenario for this locus, where os06g <dig> is the ancestral gene  that have been partially  duplicated in tandem as os06g <dig> and finally physically separated by the te-based transposition of the two transposases . overall, this example of tandem duplication followed by te-based transposition events illustrates another source of r-gene plasticity reported in the current analysis, leading to r-gene synteny erosion between closely related species.

taking into account the previous case examples obtained from cacao and rice genomes and in order to investigate r-gene synteny erosion at the whole genome level, we aligned the non-syntenic r-genes with the total r-genes repertoire. using the parameters cip > = 70% and calp > = 70%  <cit>  to identify the paired non-self matches, and according to the similarity of flanked protein-coding genes between the paired r-genes using e-value < e- <dig> as a blast threshold, we distinguished segmental from single-gene duplications  from these gene pairs . in rice, brachypodium, sorghum, and maize, we found  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  r-genes loci  involved in single-gene duplications , which is higher than the 5% to 7% of single-gene duplication frequency reported for the total annotated protein-coding genes in grasses  <cit> . among grasses, the single-gene duplication frequency in maize is significantly higher than in rice, brachypodium, and sorghum respectively . in addition, we observed hotspots of single-gene duplications where r-loci showing higher sequence similarity with at least two other non-related r-loci was considered as hotspot . in maize,  <dig> %  of the single-gene duplications frequency was observed, a much higher rate compared to  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  in rice, brachypodium, and sorghum respectively . we can then speculate that the recent wgd in maize, dating back to  <dig> mya, may have promoted and accelerated r-gene singleton duplication frequency compared to the other grasses.

homologous r-genes sequences within clusters generated by tandem duplications provided the structural template to form novel r-gene informs though domain recombinations. we characterized all the different r-domains in modern clusters and observed a specific domain affinity for clusterization . nbs-lrr and lrr-pkinase combinations are observed as representing the majority of domain combinations in clusters , compared to rare observed combinations in clusters for lrr-nbs-pkinase-wrky or lrr-tir-wrky . more interestingly, we observed a preference or affinity in domain combinations where more than 90% of them included lrr , with a preferential observed r-domain association with pkinase  and nbs  domains. therefore, our data confirm and largely refine previous conclusions suggesting lrr as a ‘glue’ for domain association leading to new combinations of r-gene domains observed in modern species, one major source of r-gene plasticity. this dynamic recombination of r-domains within clusters, especially enriching nbs-lrr associations, may promote the development a novel source of disease resistance in the investigated species.

r-gene plasticity mediated by mirna/r-gene interactome
mirnas, as a versatile class of post-transcriptional gene regulator, are reported to be involved in a large variety of cellular processes, including development and defense responses in plants  <cit> . small rna cloning and high-throughput sequencing from plants infected by pathogens have shown that many micrornas  <cit>  and sirnas  <cit>  may be involved in biotic defense responses through up or down regulation of targeted gene expression. we wanted then to investigate whether the mirna/r-gene interactome had an impact on the r-genes evolutionary plasticity as the role of mirnas in plant immunity system has been largely reported in the literature  <cit> . to unveil if the plant paleoevolution has affected or even shaped the r-gene/mirna interactome, we investigated mirnas potentially targeting r-genes in the four monocots investigated  as well as in nine eudicots .

we considered resistance genes as in silico targets of mirnas based on sequence mismatch scores using targetfinder algorithm  <cit>  . on average, we characterized  <dig> % and  <dig> % r-genes predicted as in silico targets of mirna in monocots and eudicots respectively, significantly higher than for non r-genes with  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . no highly significant differences where observed between non-conserved and conserved r-genes targeted in silico by mirnas in monocot . in eudicots, these differences  are likely to be associated with the numerous rounds of wgd. we observed a correlation  between the number of wgd rounds and the number of in silico mirna/r-gene interactions that took place in the plant paleohistory . this observation may suggest that successive wgds may have increased or putatively shaped the r-gene/mirna in silico interactome. after recent wgds, for example, in soybean, ~50% of retained r-genes  are potential targeted by mirnas with mismatch score of < =  <dig>  one explanation could be that additional species-specific r-genes copies , then leading to r-gene functional redundancy, may be repressed at the expressional level through mirnas. such suggested impact of mirna regulation on duplicated r-genes expression may need to be biologically and functionally validated.

discussion
diploidization following duplication as a major source of r-genes structural plasticity
most of the investigated rosids  species experienced up to three wgd events, whereas the investigated grasses  went through one shared ancestral wgd during their evolution, except for maize which experienced a recent extra-wgd  <dig> mya  <cit> . biased erosion of duplicated gene redundancy between sister blocks has been characterized recently in plants defining dominant and sensitive blocks  <cit> . in our current analysis, the identification of  <dig> r-genes sequences in angiosperms established a higher r-genes conservation in grasses  compared to rosids  suggesting that successive rounds of wgds act as a decay into r-genes conservation, as a primer source of r-gene plasticity. the evolutionary investigation of the characterized r-genes repertoire allowed the reconstruction of minimal ancestral pool of  <dig> and  <dig> founder r-genes respectively for the grasses and rosids.

tandem duplication or clusterization played an important role in r-genes plasticity leading to structural variations such as cnv/pav between species, which are thought to contribute to the reported tremendous r-genes diversity  <cit> . special expansion of tandem duplications especially in sensitive chromosomes, as a rapid counterbalance flow of the duplicates deletion phenomenon, may have compensate r-genes loss in such chromosomal fragments as an expected consequence of the known diploidization process. r-genes clusters may have been shaped by classically proposed shuffling mechanisms such as replication slippage, segmental duplication via homologous/non-homologous unequal crossover, transposition via ectopic recombination/te capture  <cit> . such clusters may have been shaped by domain shuffling events  <cit> , domain breakage and fusion so that r-domain combinations such as lrr-nbs-pk-tir and lrr-nbs-pk-wrky might be the result of local shuffling and recombination events. altogether, r-gene clusterization, a center source of plasticity, triggered a serial of reshuffling events to make rapid copy variation leading to pavs and cnvs between species, as a putative source for r-gene structural diversity. in the current analysis we observed up to 60% of r-genes organized in clusters in grasses and rosids. genic and intergenic sequence repeats within r-clusters generated by duplication, transpositions and insertions provide a structural template that allows mis-pairing during recombination giving rise to unequal crossovers and interlocus gene conversions/rearrangements. the resulting r-domain combinations appeared not random with lrr as a ‘glue’ for domain association leading to new resistance gene isoforms in modern plant species.

microrna/r-gene interactome as a major source of r-genes functional diploidization
recently, new evidences have been proposed regarding mirnas regulating nbs-lrr in plants such as mir2109/mir2118/mir <dig> in medicago, mir482/mir <dig> in tomato, and mir6019/mir <dig> in tobacco guiding the cleavage of transcript of nbs-lrrs, and then triggering the secondary phased of sirna production by rna-dependent rna polymerase  <cit> . thus, mirnas may be involved in defense immunity in regulating r-genes expression level. our in silico analysis suggests that mirna may target preferentially duplicated r-genes either deriving from wgds and more interestingly from local tandem duplications . this observation may suggest that the presence of redundant duplicated r-genes copies, when retained after diploidization, may require modification or specialization in expression/regulation through possibly mirna interaction. moreover, a specific r-domain affinity was observed for mirna in silico interaction toward lrr/nbs/tir, which may indicate to some extant a domain preference for r-gene/mirna interaction. overall, our data may suggest mirnas as a dosage regulator playing a possible role in r-genes functional redundancy erosion following large or local duplication events. the preferential post-transcriptional regulation of duplicated r-genes by mirna can be proposed as part of a functional diploidization process in response to duplications to maintain a perfect dosage balance regarding the product of r-genes duplicates.

putative model of r-genes paleohistory in plants
based on our analysis and previous studies, we proposed an hypothetical evolutionary model in figure  <dig> illustrating the conclusion regarding the reported r-gene conservation/diversity, polyploidization, domain reshuffling as well as microrna/r-gene interactome. if duplicated r-genes are deleted between paralogous fragments after whole genome duplications following the general subgenome dominance hypothesis  <cit> , they can be then consider as dosage-sensitive genes in returning to singleton status after wgds and then are biased distributed on the modern pairs of duplicated chromosomes . however, during evolution, if the deletion of r-genes in sensitive chromosome is compensated by high frequency of tandem duplication  and/or transposition events, an equivalent number of r-genes between dominant and sensitive fragments is observed in modern plant genomes . despite the previous structural r-genes plasticity scenario, r-genes functional redundancy within clusters or in general between duplicated loci may be counterbalanced through micrornas regulation with a specific affinity for lrr/nbs/tir domains. therefore, r-genes colinearity as well as subgenome dominance following wgds has been eroded in the course of evolution. finally r-genes clusterization may be considered as r-domain recombination hotspots, potential source of new domain combinations then possibly facilitating the neo-formation or neo-functionalization of r-genes isoforms . overall, when comparing modern plant species for their r-genes content, copy number variation , or present/absent variation  are generally observed .

CONCLUSIONS
we reconstructed the r-genes paleohistory in plant unraveling duplications  as the major source of structural  or even potentially functional  plasticity that may have promote the development a novel source of disease resistance in the course of the evolution of the different investigated species. the conserved role of similar r-gene families  in both plant and animal defense systems suggest a common and ancestral origin. the current reconstruction of the ancestral gene pool in angiosperm opens the perspective to determine the origin of innate immunity mechanism in eukaryotes.
