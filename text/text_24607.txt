BACKGROUND
in the myotome of teleost fish, new muscle fibres continue to be produced far into adulthood, whereas in mammals postnatal growth depends only on the hypertrophy of muscle fibres that are formed during embryonic development  <cit> . the post-embryonic formation of muscle fibres in fish generally occurs in two successive phases  <cit> . in the first phase, which takes place in the late embryo stage and/or in larvae, new fibres are formed at the surface of the primary myotome. this regionalised phase of myogenesis, termed stratified hyperplasia, results from the differentiation of myogenic precursor cells that derive from the dermomyotome-like epithelium that surrounds the myotome  <cit> . in the second phase of neomyogenesis, termed mosaic hyperplasia, new muscle fibres are formed on the surface of existing muscle fibres throughout the entire myotome, producing the typical mosaic appearance observed in a muscle cross section. mosaic hyperplasia is responsible for the robust increase in muscle mass in larvae and in juveniles  <cit> . myogenic precursor cells that underlie the basal lamina of mature muscle fibres power mosaic hyperplasia  <cit> . these resident quiescent cells, which are the equivalent of mammalian satellite cells, express foxk <dig> protein  <cit> , a member of the forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors and one of the few known markers of quiescent satellite cells in mammalian muscle  <cit> . although it has not been formally demonstrated, it is likely that these satellite cells in fish also originate from the dermomyotome  <cit> . in most teleost species, the onset of mosaic hyperplasia follows stratified hyperplasia and begins only in the advanced larval stages  <cit> . in contrast, in trout, mosaic hyperplasia and stratified hyperplasia occur simultaneously, immediately following the differentiation of the embryonic myotome  <cit> . this mode of growth likely accounts for the intense embryonic body growth observed in salmonids  <cit> . little is known about the genetic mechanisms regulating the formation of new myofibres in fish, primarily as a result of the difficulty of accessing the zones of myotube neoformation. in this study we have combined laser capture microdissection  <cit>  with microarray analysis to compare the transcriptome of hyperplastic subdomains of the late embryo myotome with that of adult myotomal muscle, which displays only limited muscle hyperplasia.

methods
ethics statement
this work used early trout embryos. all experiments performed in this study followed the recommendations of the “comité national de reflexion ethique sur l’experimentation animale” of the ministry of higher education and research and were approved by local animal care and use committee .

animals and sampling
all experiments were performed using rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss . laser capture microdissection of myotome subdomains was carried out on 19 day-old prehatching trout embryos. rna extraction of adult myotomal muscle was carried out using three distinct animals from a mixed-sex trout population and weighing approximately  <dig> grams. the trout were rapidly anaesthetised with phenoxyethanol  before sacrificing. a transverse slice of fast muscle situated just beneath the dorsal fin was then sampled and was stored at −80°c prior to rna extraction using using trizol reagent .

selective isolation of superficial and deep domains of the myotome of the late embryo by laser capture microscopy 
superficial growth zones under the slow muscle layer and subjacent primary myotome-derived muscle mass were separately isolated using laser capture microdissection. for this purpose, late trout embryos were frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. ten-micron- thick transverse frozen sections were cut using a cryostat , mounted onto uncoated glass slides, fixed at −20°c in 70% ethanol for 1 min, washed briefly in 70% ethanol and sequentially dehydrated in 100% ethanol and xylene. the sections were then microdissected using a veritas laser capture microdissection system  . the infrared laser was used with the following parameters: spot diameter, 20 μm; pulse duration, 3500 ms; power, 90 mw. all areas were selected and collected within 30 min of the preparation of the slide. a total of 20– <dig> laser-captured area obtained from 2– <dig> late embryos were pooled for each rna extraction. total rna was isolated using the picopurerna isolation kit  and had an rna integrity number of  <dig>  .

microarray slides
microarray experiments were performed using an agilent-based microarray platform with 8 × 60 k probes per slide . this platform, which is based on a rainbow trout resource designed by salem et al.  <cit> , has been enriched with oligonucleotides designed using recent ngs data from trout  <cit> . the microarray gene annotations were reanalysed by sigenae . microarray data sets have been submitted to the geo-ncbi with the accession number gse <dig> 

rna labelling and hybridisation
rna from  four distinct pools of laser-captured superficial area of late trout embryo myotome,  three distinct pools of laser-captured deep area of late trout myotome and  three distinct adult fast muscles were used for labelling and hybridisation. rna samples were cy3-labelled according to the manufacturer’s instructions . briefly, rna was first reverse transcribed, using a polydt-t <dig> primer, cy <dig> was incorporated by a t <dig> polymerase-mediated transcription and excess dye was removed using an rneasy kit . the level of dye incorporation was evaluated using a spectrophotometer . labelled rna was then fragmented in the appropriate buffer  for 30 minutes at 60°c before dilution  in hybridisation buffer. hybridisations were performed in a microarray hybridisation oven  overnight at 65°c, using two agilent 8 × 60 k high-density oligonucleotide microarray slides. following hybridisation, the slides were rinsed in gene expression wash buffers  <dig> and  <dig> .

data acquisition and analysis
hybridised slides were scanned at a 3-μm resolution using an agilent g <dig> microscanner. data were extracted using the standard procedures contained in the agilent feature extraction  software version  <dig> . arrays were normalised using genespring software. a t-test  and an average fold change of > <dig> were used as the criteria for defining genes as differentially expressed between hyperplastic areas of the late embryonic myotome and adult myotomal muscle. for clustering analysis, data were log transformed, median-centred and an average linkage clustering was carried out using cluster software. the results were visualised using treeview  <cit> . biological functions and pathways were generated and analysed using ingenuity pathway analysis software .

in situ hybridisation
recombinant bacterial clones were obtained from the crb gadie resource centre  or the usda . plasmid were extracted and cdna inserts were amplified by pcr using vector-specific primers. pcr products were purified and used as templates for digoxigenin -labeled probe synthesis using the riboprobe combination system - t3/t <dig> rna polymerase .

in situ hybridisation experiments were performed in 17 day-old trout embryos. briefly trout embryos were dechorionated with fine forceps and were fixed overnight at 4°c with paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline . specimens were dehydrated and stored in methanol at −20°c. after rehydration in graded methanol-pbs, embryos were processed according to established automated procedures  <cit>  with minor modifications.

RESULTS
muscle hyperplasia in the late trout embryo
the zones of myotube neoformation in the trout late embryonic myotome were visualised by in situ hybridisation of the transcript encoding myogenin, a transcriptional activator associated with the differentiation of myogenic cells. transverse sections from 19-day-old trout embryos revealed that myogenin was strongly expressed in a discrete layer at the periphery of the myotome, including the dorsal and ventral extremes, and, in a scattered pattern, throughout the deep primary myotome-derived muscle mass . these observations indicate that the predominant mode of hyperplasia in trout late embryos is stratified and occurs at the periphery of the expanding myotome. however, a deeper, sparse distribution of myogenin labelling indicates the concomitant mosaic differentiation of new fibres in the primary myotome-derived muscle mass. this pattern is in agreement with that previously reported in brown trout  <cit> .

gene expression profiling overview
superficial growth zones located beneath the slow muscle and deep primary myotome-derived muscle mass were separately laser-captured from transverse sections of 19-day-old trout embryos . four distinct pools of laser-captured superficial domains, three distinct pools of laser-captured deep domains and three distinct adult fast muscles were used for microarray experiments. an average fold change of > <dig> and p < <dig>  were used as the criteria for defining genes as differentially expressed between laser-captured growth zones located at the periphery of the late embryo myotome and adult muscle. the supervised clustering of the differentially expressed genes is shown in figure  <dig> and is available online as a browseable file  <cit> . overall,  <dig> genes were found to be up-regulated and 5841were found to be down-regulated in superficial hyperplastic areas of the late embryo myotome compared to adult muscle. consistent with the hyperplastic growth pattern in trout  <cit> , hyperplasia-correlated genes exhibit intermediate expression in deep primary myotome-derived muscle mass compared to the expression observed in superficial hyperplastic areas and in adult muscle. this is exemplified in the expression of myogenic regulatory factors including myogenin . ingenuity pathways analysis software  was used to determine significant biological functions associated with hyperplastic areas. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as eligible by ipa and were used for functional analysis. as shown in additional file  <dig>  top networks and major molecular and cellular functions associated with muscle hyperplasia-correlated genes were related to rna processing, protein synthesis, dna replication recombination and repair and cell cycle. “embryonic development”, “organismal development”, “tissue development”, and “tissue morphology”, were the top significant categories in “physiological development and system function” . the category “embryonic development” included the functional annotation “myogenesis of embryonic cell lines” while the category “tissue development” included the functional annotation “morphogenesis of muscle” .

identifying genes associated with myotube formation
muscle fibre hyperplasia involves the proliferation, fusion and differentiation of myogenic cells. these events are regulated by an interplay of intrinsic factors and extrinsic signals. therefore, to further identify candidate genes of specific relevance in the regulation of muscle hyperplasia, we focused on transcripts encoding cell-autonomous  factors such as transcriptional regulators and membrane associated proteins, and on transcripts encoding extrinsic factors such as secreted factors, including growth factors and signalling molecules.

transcriptional regulators: dna-binding transcriptional regulators
more than  <dig> dna-binding transcriptional regulators were found to be up-regulated in the superficial hyperplastic areas of the late embryonic myotome when compared to adult fast muscle . among these factors were well known regulators of muscle-specific transcription such as the paired-box transcription factors, pax <dig> and pax <dig>  which mark immature myogenic cells, and the myogenic bhlh transcription factors such as myod , myf <dig>  mrf <dig> and myogenin, which act downstream of the pax3/ <dig> genes to trigger myogenic differentiation . in addition to these canonical myogenic regulators, we found a large set of genes encoding homeobox motif-containing transcriptional regulators such as members of the meis family , activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox protein, lbx <dig> and arx  . several genes found to be up-regulated in our analysis encode transcriptional regulators of the sox family, such as sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig>  also were found the winged helix factor foxc <dig> as well as tbx <dig> and tbx <dig> which are members of the t-box dna binding-containing protein family. among the transcriptional regulators with zinc finger motifs, we identified gli <dig> and snail <dig>  as well as zic <dig> and zic <dig>  a salient feature of the hyperplastic zones was the strong enrichment of genes encoding members of hairy/enhancer of split  family proteins such as hairy and enhancer of split  <dig>  as well as hes-related transcriptional factors including hairy enhancer of split with yrpw motif protein  <dig>  and  <dig>  . seven distinct c-myc paralogs were up-regulated in hyperplastic areas  along with their associated factor max and the upstream transcriptional regulators the fuse binding proteins fubp <dig>  fubp <dig> and fubp <dig>  finally, we observed an enrichment for members of the ap- <dig> family  in hyperplastic zones.

transcriptional regulators: epigenetic factors
a salient feature of the expression profiling of the superficial hyperplastic areas of the late embryonic myotome, when compared to adult fast muscle, was the strong enrichment for genes encoding epigenetic transcriptional regulators. among these regulators were proteins belonging to the polycomb groups , including polycomb protein scmh <dig>  polycomb-group ring finger proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  and polyhomeotic-like proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  all of which are components of the multiprotein prc1-like complex  <cit> . in our expression profiling we also identified the histone-lysine n-methyltransferase ezh <dig>  rbbp <dig>  polycomb protein suz12-b, polycomb protein eed and jarid <dig>  all of which associate with the pcr <dig> complex  <cit> . in addition, several histone modifying enzymes of the protein arginine methyltransferases  families, such as prmt <dig>  pmrt <dig>  prmt4/carm <dig>  prtm <dig>  prtm <dig> and prmt <dig> were found to be overexpressed in germinal zones . another group of up-regulated epigenetic regulators included several swi/snf chromatin-remodelling enzymes .

membrane-associated proteins
more than  <dig> membrane protein-encoding genes were found to be overexpressed in superficial hyperplastic zones of the late embryo myotome compared to adult fast muscle . among these genes we observed a large set of immunoglobulin superfamily cell surface proteins, including the promyogenic cell surface receptors n-cam, m-cadherin , n-cadherin , kin of irre  <dig>  brother of cdo  and protogenin . other transmembrane proteins containing ig domain were also identified, including jam 2b and the receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatases u, sigma and delta . transmembrane proteins overexpressed in hyperplastic zones also included adam  <dig> and adamts  <dig>  which are members of the disintegrin and metalloprotease family. in addition, cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein  <dig>  trophoblast glycoprotein, several tetraspanins, receptor binding cancer antigen expressed on siso cells /rcas <dig>  bmp receptor type ib, tissue factor/cd <dig>  integrin alpha  <dig>  the planar cell polarity effectors vang-like protein  <dig> and  <dig>  multiple ligand binding receptors such as fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  ephrin type a receptor  <dig> and ephrin type b receptor  <dig>  tnf receptor member  <dig> and frizzled receptors  were all up-regulated in the microarray.

signalling environment components and other secreted factors
when compared to adult fast muscle, superficial hyperplastic areas of the late embryo myotome were found to up-regulate a large set of secreted factors that are presented in figure  <dig>  some of these factors, such as bmp <dig> and wnt proteins , are morphogens known to regulate developmental processes. secreted antagonists of bmp , wnt  and myostatin ) were also found to be up-regulated. growth factors overexpressed in hyperplastic zones included fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  il <dig>  hepatoma derived growth factor, hepatoma derived growth factor-related protein  <dig>  anterior gradient proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  neurotrophin  <dig>  pleiotrophic factors alpha- <dig> and proheparin-binding egf-like growth factor. other factors overexpressed in the late embryonic myotome included nattectin, netrin  <dig>  netrin  <dig> and galectin  <dig> and  <dig>  which regulate cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions, cytolysin src- <dig>  which is involved in membrane reorganisation, fam3c, and several members of the semaphorin family, such as semaphorin 3d and 7a. finally, we observed the up-regulation of sulf- <dig>  an extracellular endosulfatase that regulates growth factor signalling for satellite cell differentiation.

in situ hybridisation of transcripts up-regulated in laser-captured peripheral hyperplastic domains of the myotome
one hundred fifty genes found to be up-regulated in laser-captured superficial hyperplastic areas versus adult fast muscle and representing a broad range of biological functions were selected and their expression was investigated by whole-mount in situ hybridisation on 17-day-old prehatching trout embryos. at this stage, the dermomyotome-like epithelium, which provides myogenic cell precursors for lateral fast muscle expansion, is still apparent at the surface of the myotome  <cit> . approximately 15% of the clones tested gave a clear signal within the myotome of the late trout embryo indicating that a large fraction of the transcripts up-regulated in hyperplastic zones are expressed at a level too low to be detected in situ using our hybridisation conditions. when present, signals were always observed at the surface of the myotome, either in the myogenic progenitors forming the dermomyotome-like epithelium, as in the case with gremlin, sfrp <dig>  brother of cdo  and kin of irre  <dig> or more medially, in the differentiating myofibres, as observed for hes- <dig>  m-cadherin and c-myc .

discussion
by taking advantage of laser capture microdissection and microarray technologies we aimed in this study to discover genes that potentially regulate myotube neoformation in fish. combining these experimental approaches we identified nearly  <dig> genes that were up-regulated in superficial growth  zones of the late trout embryo myotome compared to adult myotomal muscle. in these zones, our transcriptomic analysis revealed the up-regulation of canonical genes known to have a role in controlling myogenesis, such as pax <dig>  pax <dig> and the four bhlh myogenic factors. this observation indicates that muscle hyperplasia depends on the genetic regulatory pathways that regulate the initial  myogenesis. the overexpression of the muscle progenitor markers pax <dig> and pax <dig> is likely the result of undifferentiated dermomyotome-derived myogenic cells, which are transiently stockpiled in the lateral fast muscle before they differentiate into new myofibers , in the captured material. along with mrf genes, we observed the up-regulation of tsh <dig>  arx, meis <dig> and the homeodomain containing protein pbx <dig>  all of which have been reported to modulate the activity of mrf during skeletal muscle differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, we observed the overexpression of a variety of transcriptional regulators for which a function in myogenesis has not been shown or is poorly documented; for example, we noted the up-regulation of seven distinct members of the myc family. using in situ hybridisation, we further showed that c-myc transcript is detectable in differentiating myotubes indicating that c-myc not only regulates cell growth, apoptosis and metabolism as classically reported  <cit> , but may also activate, at least in myogenic cells, the differentiation machinery. among the hes gene family members overexpressed in hyperplastic zones, we found her <dig>  hey <dig> and hey <dig> which are transcribed in the developing primary myotome of zebrafish  <cit> . in addition, we showed in this study that hes <dig> and hairy related- <dig> transcripts are detectable in superficial hyperplastic zones using in situ hybridisation. in keeping with a possible role for hes <dig> in trout muscle hyperplasia, it is worth noting that the microinjection of hes <dig> rna into xenopus embryos induces an impairment of terminal differentiation and an expansion of the myotome  <cit> . sox <dig> and sox <dig> transcripts were also up-regulated in laser-captured samples from the peripheral domain of the myotome. we have recently shown that sox <dig> is expressed in myogenic cells from the dermomyotome-like epithelium notably at the level of the dorsal and ventral lips  <cit> . we report in this study a similar pattern of sox <dig> expression, indicating that these two genes are transcribed in dermomyotome-derived cells prior their differentiation. in addition to dna-binding transcriptional regulators, we observed the up-regulation in hyperplasic area of a large set of genes involved in chromatin remodelling. specifically, we observed the up-regulation of ezh <dig>  an essential component of the polycomb-repressive complex, which has been recently reported to control self-renewal and preservation of the transcriptional identity of skeletal muscle stem cells  <cit> . additionally, we report the overexpression of histone modifying enzymes including protein arginine methyltransferase  <dig>  and  <dig> , which, in zebrafish, have a major role in controlling mrf expression and proper myogenesis  <cit> . among the swi/snf chromatin remodelling enzymes overexpressed in our analysis it is worth noting that brg1/smarca <dig> has been shown to alter chromatin structure at myogenic loci facilitating transcription  <cit> .

myoblast fusion is required for muscle fibre formation. this step depends on cell-cell contact that is mediated by proteins present at the surface of the myoblats  <cit>  . among the large set of membrane proteins up-regulated in hyperplastic zones were found many genes encoding ig-domain containing transmembrane proteins such as kin of irre  <dig>  ncam, n-cadherin, m-cadherin and brother of cdo, all of which are known to influence cell-cell interactions during myoblast differentiation or fusion  <cit> . surprisingly, in contrast to m-cadherin, which is expressed in differentiating myoblasts located at the periphery of the expanding myotome  <cit> , kin of irre  <dig> and brother of cdo were found to be transcribed primarily in the external dermomyotome-like epithelium, similar to what is observed for n-cadherin  <cit> . this indicates that the transcription of kin of irre  <dig> and brother of cdo takes place early in the myogenic progenitor cells that participate in the second wave of myofibre formation and does not depend on mrf activity. interestingly, we found that junctional adhesion molecule jam2b which is closely related to jam2a  and jam3b , both critical for myocyte fusion  <cit> , was also up-regulated along with protogenin which is closely related to the promyogenic transmembrane protein neogenin  <cit> . the ig superfamily members cd  <dig> and cd  <dig>  which were up-regulated in our microarray, have also been detected at the surface of mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit> , suggesting a role for these two proteins in early myoblast-myoblast interactions. other membrane proteins that were both up-regulated in superficial hyperplastic zones in our study and that have been detected at the surface of c2c <dig> cells included cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein <dig>  trophoblast glycoprotein, tissue factor/cd <dig>  ephrin type a receptor  <dig>  tetraspanin  <dig> and  <dig> and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>   <cit> . fgfr <dig> is highly expressed during chick embryo muscle differentiation  <cit>   and muscle regeneration  <cit> . our data further support the involvement of fgfr <dig> in fish muscle hyperplasia as fgf <dig>  a secreted ligand that binds to fgfr <dig>  <cit> , is overexpressed in laser-captured hyperplastic zones. other secreted factors that may act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to regulate muscle hyperplasia included anteriorgradient protein  <dig> which acts as a growth factor for blastema cells during regeneration of salamander limbs  <cit> , and neurotrophin  <dig>  which acts as a regulator of the development, maintenance and regeneration of skeletal muscle fibres  <cit> . in addition, the expression of both hepatoma-derived growth factor and hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein  <dig> was up-regulated in hyperplastic zones. hepatoma derived growth factor is a heparin binding protein that promotes the proliferation, differentiation and migration of various cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> .

the sema3d and sema7a proteins that were up-regulated in our microarray, are also produced by c2c <dig> differentiating myogenic cells  <cit> . these secreted proteins were initially identified as regulators of axon guidance  <cit>  and, subsequently, were shown to participate in myogenic differentiation  <cit> . superficial growth zones exhibits high levels of expression of various morphogens or secreted antagonists of morphogens, suggesting that these areas are subjected to complex overlapping morphogenic signals. an example of this from our analysis is the up-regulation of both gremlin- <dig> and sfrp <dig>  gremlin- <dig> is known to inhibit tgfβ/bmp activity and thus favours myogenic cell differentiation  <cit> . however, sfrp <dig>  by inhibiting the myogenic activity of wnt, is predicted to prevent precocious myogenic differentiation. interestingly, the expression of wnt <dig> and wnt <dig> is up-regulated in hyperplastic zones along with the transmembrane receptors frizzled  <dig> and  <dig>  the protocadherin fat <dig>  the dishevelled interactor dact <dig> and the planar cell polarity effectors vang-like <dig> and vang-like <dig>  this suggests that a pathway similar to planar cell polarity  <cit> , which is notably involved in the oriented elongation of early muscle fibres  <cit> , may regulate the formation of new muscle fibres at the surface of the trout primary myotome.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, lcm and microarray analysis were used as tools to characterise the transcriptomal landscape of the superficial growth zones of the early fish myotome. our data provide a valuable resource for the further characterisation of individual genes, sets of genes and signalling pathways that may control the neoformation of myotubes in fish. in addition, this work serves as a potentially useful source of information for the identification of novel genes that regulate muscle regeneration in vertebrates.
