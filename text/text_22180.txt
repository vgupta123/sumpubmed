BACKGROUND
the genetics of olfactory system development is largely unexplored in most non-model insect species, including hematophagous disease vector mosquitoes, which use olfactory cues to detect blood meal hosts. to address this issue, we have begun a large-scale effort to develop the dengue and yellow fever vector mosquito aedes aegypti as a model for studying vector mosquito neurodevelopmental biology  <cit> . our recent study demonstrated that chitosan/sirna targeting can be used to knockdown genes during mosquito larval and pupal development  <cit> . here, this methodology is applied to assess how odorant receptor  expression is regulated in olfactory receptor neurons  during a. aegypti larval development.

the coordinated developmental regulation of orn targeting and or expression, both of which are critical to the sense of smell, dictates what odors will be detected by a neuron and which behaviors are elicited in response to these odors  <cit> . research in the genetic model insect drosophila melanogaster has provided insight into how these two processes are regulated during pupal development  <cit> . d. melanogaster orns are located in the antenna and maxillary palp. these orns typically express one of  <dig> possible or genes, the choice of which is determined through a process that produces a stereotyped receptor to neuron map  <cit> . systematic and genetic analysis of the regulation of drosophila or expression in pupae and adults has suggested that each or gene has a “zip code” which consists of enhancer elements that act positively to promote expression of particular ors in some neurons, as well as elements that restrict or expression in others  <cit> . recent work, including a large-scale rnai-screen, has revealed a number of transcription factors that bind these regulatory elements to regulate or gene expression in drosophila <cit> . these cis-regulatory factors are differentially expressed in orns and required for proper regulation of the expression of or genes  <cit> . the particular combination and levels of expression of these cis-regulators of transcription in specific neurons generates the or regulatory matrix, a code governing which particular or gene is expressed and which are repressed in any given orn. ultimately, orns expressing the same or gene project axons that converge on the same glomerulus, one of several spheroidal modules located in the antennal lobe of the insect brain  <cit> .

the insect larval olfactory system mimics the architecture of the olfactory system found in pupae and adults, but is reduced in cell number and therefore less complex  <cit> . this reduced complexity makes the larval antennal lobe an excellent tissue in which to track olfactory system development. it is presently unclear if any of the transcription factors that function to regulate or expression in d. melanogaster pupae/adults are required for or expression in larvae. moreover, although there is evidence that drosophila larval orns expressing the same or project to similar areas of the larval brain  <cit> , it is unclear how this process is regulated, or if a regulatory matrix exists for this less sophisticated larval olfactory system. our recent study detailed orn targeting in the developing a. aegypti larval olfactory system  <cit> . here, the regulation of or gene expression is examined in the developing a. aegypti larval antenna.

this investigation focuses on functional characterization of the a. aegypti ortholog of the transcription factor single-minded . although sim is known to regulate or expression in drosophila pupae/adults  <cit> , its function has not been assessed in the developing larval olfactory system. moreover, a requirement for sim to regulate or gene expression has not yet been assessed during olfactory development in other insects, including mosquitoes. furthermore, a requirement for sim in the regulation of orn innervation of the antennal lobe has not yet been described in any insect species, including drosophila. here, we use chitosan/sirna-mediated knockdown to test the hypothesis that sim is required for olfactory system development in a. aegypti larvae and pupae. the results of this study suggest that sim function is required for proper or expression and antennal lobe development during both the larval and pupal stages of a. aegypti development.

RESULTS
expression and chitosan/sirna nanoparticle-mediated knockdown of sim during a. aegypti olfactory development
a search for consensus binding sites in the 5’ flanking sequences of the  <dig> a. aegypti or genes  <cit>  uncovered multiple consensus binding sites for the transcription factors acj <dig>  fer <dig>  onecut, pdm <dig>  xbp <dig>  and sim . these data suggested that the transcription factors function to regulate a. aegypti or gene expression. in support of this notion, expression of each transcription factor was detected in developing antennal orns . furthermore, expression of aae e <dig>  and aae zf30c , aedes orthologs of two transcription factors that regulate drosophila or gene expression  <cit> , was also detected in developing antennae . expression of each of the eight transcription factors is detected in a subset of a. aegypti antennal orns, and expression levels of each gene vary from neuron to neuron within this subset. these expression data , in conjunction with detection of consensus binding sites adjacent to aedes or genes , suggest that the transcription factors may be required for a. aegypti or expression.

consensus binding site sequences  <cit>  for six transcription factors  expressed in the developing a. aegypti antenna are noted. numerous consensus binding sites  for these transcription factors were found in the  <dig> kb 5’ flanking sequences upstream of the open reading frame  of the  <dig> annotated a. aegypti or genes  <cit> . of these, sim was observed to have at least one binding site in over half of the or genes, suggesting it might be one of the major regulators of or transcription in a. aegypti.

sim consensus binding sites were identified in the 5’ flanking sequences of approximately half of the or genes . further analysis of sim expression in the developing olfactory system indicated that in addition to being expressed in l <dig> antennal sensory neurons , sim is transcribed in the l <dig> brain, where it is expressed in clusters of cells adjacent to the larval antennal lobe . based on these observations, we hypothesized that sim is required for a. aegypti olfactory system development and pursued sirna-mediated targeting of aae sim to test the hypothesis.

 . qrt-pcr assays with pooled brains dissected from whole animals indicated that in comparison to brains from control-nanoparticle fed animals, sim knockdown brains had on average a 47% reduction in sim transcripts . knockdown levels observed in the antennae, in which a 77% reduction in sim levels was observed with respect to control-fed animals , were even higher. despite some variability in the levels of knockdown between tissues and between animals, which is typical in rnai experiments, in situ hybridization experiments indicated that sim transcripts were undetectable in half of the knockdown animals following treatment with sim

 sirna . thus, use of the chitosan/sirna knockdown technique permitted knockdown of aae sim and analysis of its function during olfactory system development. moreover, use of the two separate sim knockdown sirnas throughout the investigation helped to ensure that the phenotypes generated were not simply the result of off-site targeting by either sirna.

sim is required for or gene expression in the developing a. aegypti larval antenna
the reduced complexity of the mosquito larval olfactory system, which mimics the adult architecture  <cit> , makes it an excellent tissue in which to assess the impacts of sim knockdown on or expression. for example, only a subset of the  <dig> a. aegypti or genes has been detected in the larval antenna, including  <dig> detected by qrt-pcr  <cit> , and an additional four  which were detected here through in situ hybridization experiments in the l <dig> antenna . consensus binding sites for sim were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> or genes expressed in the larval antenna , including orco  and ors  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  92a, and  <dig>  expression of these ors was assessed through in situ hybridization in fourth instar sim knockdown larval antennae. these experiments revealed that although expression of these genes could be detected in wildtype and control-fed l <dig> animals, transcripts of orco, or <dig>  or <dig>  or <dig>  and or <dig>  could not be detected in sim knockdown l <dig> animals, while expression of ors  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  is reduced in comparison to wildtype and control-fed larvae. in contrast, expression of or <dig> , which lacks an adjacent sim binding site, was not impacted by knockdown of sim. in addition to demonstrating that loss of or expression in sim knockdown animals correlates with the presence of sim binding sites, this result demonstrated that sim knockdown antennal sensory neurons, which do express or <dig>  do not simply die in response to sim knockdown. this was further confirmed through nuclear staining and a lack of expression of the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase- <dig> in sim knockdown antennae . moreover, acetylated tubulin staining of antennae revealed normal antennal sensory neuron axon bundles in sim knockdown antennae , suggesting that axonogenesis initiates properly in sim knockdown orns. in summary, the expression of or genes bearing flanking sim consensus binding sites was compromised during l <dig> antennal development in sim knockdown animals, but loss of sim did not impact cell survival or the initiation of axonogenesis in l <dig> orns.

antennal lobe phenotypes in sim knockdown larvae
the regulation of or gene expression and orn targeting are tightly coordinated during pupal olfactory system development  <cit> . it was therefore hypothesized that sim might also function to regulate orn targeting, even during these earlier larval stages of development. to test this hypothesis, anterograde antennal sensory neuron fills and immunohistochemical marker analyses were used to examine antennal lobe development in control-fed vs. sim knockdown l <dig> animals. as discussed previously  <cit> , in wildtype and control-fed l <dig> larvae, antennal sensory neuron tracts exit the antenna  and enter the developing antennal lobe region of the brain . expression of mab nc <dig>  which marks the synaptic neuropil in a. aegypti <cit> , labels the antennal lobe in wildtype  and control-fed  animals, where filled antennal sensory neurons synapse with projection neurons that are marked by expression of serotonin  in wildtype  and control-fed  animals. anterograde labeling experiments detected a reduction in the number of antennal sensory neurons targeting the antennal lobe in sim

  knockdown l <dig> animals. as discussed above, this reduced number of antennal sensory neurons in the antennal lobe does not appear to result from cell death  or a lack of the initiation of axonogenesis in these neurons . the sim knockdown l <dig> larvae were also assessed through staining with mab nc <dig>  and anti-5ht  antibodies. these experiments indicated that sim

deficient odorant tracking in sim knockdown animals
individual sim knockdown and control-fed fourth instar larvae were tested in an olfactory-driven behavioral assay utilized in a recent study  <cit>  which was modified from liu et al.  <cit> . in the assay, control-fed and sim knockdown individuals were assessed for attraction to a yeast odorant pellet. all control fed animals  touched the yeast pellet during the assay , and in situ hybridization experiments revealed wildtype levels of sim expression in the antennae and brains of these animals . knockdown of sim through nanoparticle delivery of either knockdown sirna sim

the data above represent a compiled summary of results obtained from four replicate experiments in which control-fed vs. sim knockdown  animals were tested in a yeast odorant attractant behavioral assay. the total number of animals  indicates the number of individuals that were tested in these assays. the number of individuals  that were attracted  or not attracted  under each condition  are indicated, and the percentages of total animals are indicated following the raw numbers. in situ hybridization was used to assess sim knockdown in the brains and antennae of animals attracted  or not attracted  to the yeast. the raw number/percentage of animals with normal , null , or moderate  levels of sim are indicated. loss of sim was found to correlate well with a lack of attraction to the yeast in this behavioral assay.

the decreased attraction of sim knockdown animals to the yeast pellet  correlated well with the or gene expression  and antennal lobe  defects noted in sim knockdown animals. however, given the complexity of larval feeding behavior, it is possible that the observed sim knockdown behavioral phenotype could result at least in part from other defects in sim deficient animals. neither the control nor sim knockdown nanoparticle-fed animals displayed any obvious locomotor defects, suggesting that locomotor deficit was not responsible for the observed behavioral defect. it is unlikely, albeit possible, that reduced attraction could in part result from gustatory defects in sim knockdown larvae that might be unable to taste any trace amounts of yeast which could diffuse through the water during the course of the assay. in the l <dig> brain of wildtype  and control-fed  animals, a subset of antennal sensory neurons project ventrally from the antennal lobe to the subesophageal ganglion. as discussed previously  <cit> , these neurons likely function as gustatory neurons. this subset of neurons is also substantially reduced in sim knockdown animals . thus, both olfactory receptor and gustatory receptor neuron defects are observed in the antennal lobes of sim knockdown animals . these sim knockdown defects, in addition to or gene expression defects , correlate well with the decreased attraction to yeast behavioral phenotype .

or expression and antennal lobe phenotypes in sim knockdown pupae
expression of sim is detected in both the pupal brain  and antenna . given this expression and the extent of olfactory system defects observed in larvae, it seemed likely that olfactory developmental phenotypes might also be detected in sim knockdown pupae. we therefore examined if olfactory phenotypes could be detected in sim knockdown animals at 36 hrs after pupal formation , a time point that more closely resembles the morphology of the adult olfactory system  <cit> . it was confirmed that chitosan/sirna-mediated sim knockdown in the olfactory system persists through the pupal stages in sim

discussion
sim is required for or expression during a. aegypti larval and pupal development
knowledge of the genetic control of or expression during the larval stages of insect development is extremely limited. moreover, the genes required for or expression had not been assessed during any stage of the mosquito life cycle. knockdown of aae sim resulted in decreased expression of multiple or genes during a. aegypti development . transcripts for a number of the ors assayed could not be detected through whole mount in situ hybridization in sim knockdown animals . this was the case for orco , the obligate co-receptor in the assembly and function of heteromeric or/orco complexes, which was recently shown to be required for a. aegypti human blood meal host preference and their ability to be repelled by volatile deet  <cit> . consensus binding sites for sim, a pas-bhlh transcription factor, were identified in over half the a. aegypti or genes, including orco, suggesting that sim likely functions directly as a cis-regulator of or expression . of course this will need to be tested more carefully in future experiments, which might include generation and comparison of transgenic reporters in which the sim consensus binding sites in or enhancers are in intact vs. mutated. such experiments will become more feasible as transgenic technology in mosquitoes advances.

in some cases, the impact of sim knockdown on or transcript levels appears to extend beyond the sim expression domain. for example, ors  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in proximal antennal sensory neuron cell bodies located outside the normal sim expression domain, yet expression of these ors is not detected throughout the sim knockdown antenna . these data suggest that sim may also regulate a. aegypti or expression indirectly and non-cell autonomously in some orns. the mechanism by which sim regulates the expression of these or genes remains to be determined. however, the non-cell autonomous impacts of sim knockdown on the levels of these or transcripts is not likely to be a non-specific consequence of sim knockdown. loss of sim function does not appear to result in antennal cell death . moreover, the normal expression pattern of or  <dig>  in the sim knockdown antenna suggests that these antennal sensory neurons begin to differentiate properly . thus, the sim knockdown or expression phenotypes reported do not appear to result from non-specific global or neural differentiation defects. this notion is further supported by acetylated tubulin staining data, which detected normal antennal sensory neuron axon bundles in sim knockdown antennae .

in the d. melanogaster developing cns, sim is known to repress gene transcription through the activation of repressive factors  <cit> . analysis of or expression in aae sim knockdown animals did not reveal any cases in which or expression was activated in response to loss of sim function. thus, although sim may have both direct and indirect roles in the regulation of or expression, sim knockdown data suggest that it functions as a positive regulator of or expression in a. aegypti.

loss of sim resulted in loss of or expression in both larvae  and pupae . these findings suggest that a least one transcription factor functions to regulate or expression at both the larval and pupal stages of insect development. it remains to be seen if this will be the case for other transcription factors expressed in the a. aegypti larval antenna . moreover, it will be interesting to identify the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the differential or gene expression in larval  vs. adult  a. aegypti mosquitoes that was noted in a previous study  <cit> . the results of this investigation suggest that the general mechanisms for regulation of or expression may be generally well conserved between dipteran insects. transcription factors with consensus binding sites flanking mosquito or genes , all of which are expressed in the mosquito larval antenna , also function in the d. melanogaster pupal/adult regulatory matrix  <cit> . although the roles of these transcription factors remain to be assessed in drosophila larvae, these observations are interesting given the expansion and rapid diversification of mosquito or genes with respect to d. melanogaster <cit> . the conservation of transcriptional regulation mechanisms may help to explain why comparative analysis of drosophila species suggests that although the sequences of particular ors have diverged between species, the odor response spectra and organization of orns are well conserved  <cit> .

coordinate regulation of or expression and orn targeting
although or expression does not play an instructive role in orn targeting, the regulation of or gene expression and orn targeting are tightly coordinated during olfactory system development  <cit> . pupal orns expressing the same or gene project axons that converge on the same glomerulus, one of several spheroidal modules located in the antennal lobe of the insect brain  <cit> . the genetic mechanisms responsible for the coordination of these two processes are not well understood in pupae. moreover, although there is evidence that drosophila larval orns expressing the same or project to similar areas of the larval brain  <cit> , it is unclear how this process is regulated. our studies indicate that in the absence of sim, larval and pupal or expression is disrupted, and orn projections are sparser and more disorganized . with respect to the antennal lobe phenotype, it is of course difficult to know if sim is functioning in the antennal sensory neurons or in the brain, as it is expressed in both tissues . moreover, the sophisticated tissue/cell-specific knockdown experiments that are routine in drosophila, a more genetically tractable system, are not yet possible in the developing mosquito olfactory system. the development of such technologies would permit us to pursue a more complete understanding of the role of sim in the regulation of orn targeting. still, in light of our present observations, it is interesting to consider that two drosophila cis-regulators of or transcription, acj <dig> and pdm <dig>  also function to regulate orn targeting  <cit> . combined, these results suggest that a single transcription factor can function to regulate both orn targeting and or expression during insect development. thus, it is possible that the regulatory matrix for or expression in any given insect neuron also serves as the regulatory matrix for orn targeting of that neuron. in other words, the transcriptional code that controls insect or gene expression in an orn also regulates axon targeting in that orn. it will be interesting to determine if the newly identified regulators of or gene expression uncovered in a recent d. melanogaster screen  <cit>  also control orn targeting in mosquitoes and fruit flies. such a combined transcriptional regulatory mechanism may underlie the precise coordination of or gene expression and orn targeting observed in the developing insect olfactory system.

a critical need to understand the regulation of gene expression in vector mosquitoes
knowledge of developmental gene regulatory regions has resulted in important advancements for the mosquito research community and vector control. for example, adelman et al. <cit>  used the regulatory regions of the developmental gene nanos to drive sex- and tissue-specific expression of transposase in female germ cells, a key innovation in mosquito transgenic technology. furthermore, the recent design and release of a. aegypti bearing a conditional dominant lethal gene that yields a female-flightless phenotype  <cit>  evolved from the identification and use of a tissue and sex specific regulatory element, aaeact- <dig>  which drives gene expression in the indirect flight muscles of female pupae. unfortunately, we presently lack drivers for temporal and tissue-specific gene expression in mosquitoes. the regulation of gene expression is a core aspect of developmental biology, as differential gene expression is central to cell patterning, differentiation, and most developmental processes. thus expansion of our efforts to study mosquito development will uncover information about cis-regulatory elements. such knowledge could be applied to the engineering of drivers that may be used to promote gene expression in specific orns. such tools, which have been developed in genetic model organisms such as d. melanogaster, would be a tremendous asset to mosquito researchers studying insect olfaction. knowledge of enhancers in the developing olfactory system may also inform the design of transgenics that could one day be used in integrated vector management strategies.

sirna chitosan/nanoparticle gene targeting in a. aegypti
the results of this investigation, in conjunction with our recent functional analysis of sema1a in a. aegypti <cit> , have demonstrated that chitosan/sirna nanoparticle-mediated gene targeting can be used to disrupt olfactory system development in insects. the average sim knockdown levels obtained in both the brain and antennae were reasonably high in this study, with average knockdown levels in the antennae exceeding those of the brain. these results, in conjunction with previous experiments  <cit> , demonstrate that the central and sensory nervous systems are not refractory to sirnas. moreover, within the population of sim knockdown animals, one finds that half of the animals display nearly complete loss of sim expression in their brains and antennae . thus, use of chitosan/sirna nanoparticle gene targeting allows for efficient knockdown and the ability to determine the time point in which knockdown is initiated. controlling the timing of knockdown initiation is helpful for pursuing analysis of developmental regulatory gene function, particularly given that we have not yet developed technology for pursuing mosaic clonal studies in a. aegypti, a routine strategy for characterizing embryonic lethal loss of function mutations in d. melanogaster. likewise, for this reason, talen-based strategies for site-directed mutagenesis will unfortunately not permit characterization of the late larval or pupal functions of genes for which loss of function mutations result in early developmental lethality. moreover, the short length of sirnas makes it more straightforward to design them to be both gene and species-specific, thereby decreasing the potential for off-site targeting, an advantage that is helpful both at the bench and perhaps even someday in the field if issues such as cost and delivery of chitosan/sirnas could be addressed. for now, chitosan sirna nanoparticle gene targeting is emerging as a very useful tool for analysis of late larval and pupal development in mosquitoes. this technique could likely be adapted to study olfactory system development in a wide variety of arthropod species. these additional studies are necessary given the paucity of information concerning development of this tissue in most insect species --which is extremely unfortunate given the wealth of diversity that exists in this insect sensory system.

CONCLUSIONS
chitosan/sirna-mediated knockdown experiments demonstrated that sim regulates both larval and pupal olfactory system development in the disease vector mosquito a. aegypti. sim positively regulates the expression of a large subset of larval or genes. the detection of sim consensus binding sites in the 5’ flanking regions of these or genes suggests that sim directly activates or gene expression. however, analysis of the expression pattern of sim suggests that it may also function non-cell autonomously as a regulator of or expression. thus, sim may regulate or gene expression through direct and/or indirect mechanisms, a question for future studies. sirna-mediated sim knockdown experiments also revealed antennal lobe defects, including decreased orn innervation of the larval antennal lobe. these antennal lobe and or expression defects correlated with a larval odorant tracking behavioral defect. or expression and antennal lobe defects were also observed in sim knockdown pupae. these results suggest that sim functions in multiple aspects of a. aegypti olfactory system development during both the larval and pupal stages of development.
