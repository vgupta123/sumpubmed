BACKGROUND
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia , a pulmonary disease caused by mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides sc  is a major constraint to cattle production in africa  <cit> . the current vaccines are not always fully effective  <cit>  and there remains an urgent need to control or even eradicate the disease. although the nucleotide sequence of the mmmsc type strain pg <dig> genome is available, the proteins responsible for protection have not been identified. accordingly, an important step towards a subunit vaccine would be to identify which of the potentially large number of antigens encoded in its genome  <cit>  actually trigger immune responses during infection. serum antibodies are likely to be involved in immunity since passive transfer of sera from recovered cattle can protect recipient calves  <cit> , but th <dig> memory lymphocytes and γδ t-cells are also active  <cit> . identifying which antigens evoke one or more of these immune pathways therefore remains a key step in developing a subunit-based cbpp vaccine  <cit> .

phage display  <cit>  makes it possible to identify antigenic proteins by using antibodies from an immune source to select binding peptides from a large repertoire of random amino acid sequences  <cit> . fragmented-genome or "shotgun" display libraries  <cit>  can directly identify genes that code for the proteins of which the immunoselected peptides form a part. provided that artefactual binders expressed by frame-shifted or incorrectly orientated inserts are excluded  <cit> , matching the sequence coding for an antigenic peptide with the sequence of the genome from which it is derived locates the encoding gene. the first mmmsc display library was constructed by persson and co-workers  <cit>  and more recently, the approach was also applied to mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  <cit>  as a way of identifying immunogenic polypeptides.

to locate genes coding for potentially immunogenic proteins, enzymatically-generated fragments of mmmsc chromosomal dna were used to construct a genome-specific filamentous phage display library which was subjected to selection using antibodies from a cbpp outbreak in botswana  <cit>  and an experimentally infected animal from mali designated c <dig>  <cit> . cd4+ t-cell activation and ifnγ release are associated with an igg <dig> humoral immune response  <cit>  while iga is associated with local mucosal immunity. accordingly, both immunoglobulin classes were used separately to select peptides as well as using total igg. using this approach together with computer algorithms designed to identify linear b-cell epitopes  <cit> , five genes were chosen to be expressed for further analysis and testing to establish whether they were recognised by sera from cattle obtained during a natural outbreak of the disease.

RESULTS
construction of a fragmented-genome library
a piii fusion protein phage display library of approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> primary clones displaying peptides derived from the mmmsc genome was constructed by ligating dna fragments ranging in size from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> bp as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis into a filamentous phage display vector. the probability of the genome being represented was  <dig>  if the average insert size was  <dig> bp. dna sequencing of  <dig> arbitrarily-chosen clones showed no obvious bias towards any particular region of the mycoplasmal genome. of the  <dig>  two copies of one of the sequenced dna inserts were in-frame and in the correct orientation. the largest insert was  <dig> base pairs and the smallest  <dig> 

to verify that the library was large and diverse enough to identify other unknown mmmsc antigens, it was first screened in a defined model system by panning on immuno-purified igg prepared from a rabbit immune serum directed against amino acid residues 328- <dig> of the proline-rich mmmsc glycoprotein which is coded for by orf <dig> . multiple copies of overlapping peptides that mapped to a defined region on the target glycoprotein spanning residues  <dig> to  <dig> were selected .

identification of antigenic peptides
panning experiments aimed at selecting phage displayed peptides that were recognised by the total serum igg, the igg <dig> component and the iga subpopulation of animal c <dig> and pooled serum from seven cattle affected by a cbpp outbreak in botswana were performed. clones selected by each immunoglobulin class were randomly chosen for dna sequencing. after panning, all clones were in-frame and without stops. fifteen peptides recognised by the total igg preparation from the serum of animal c <dig> matched regions in eight different mmmsc proteins in the embl/genbank database, while  <dig> peptides that had been selected using igg <dig> corresponded with regions on  <dig> different proteins . the library was not panned with total serum igg from botswana but peptides were selected using igg <dig> which matched parts of four of the proteins identified by the c <dig> antiserum . bronchoalveolar lavage  iga from animal c <dig> specifically selected four peptides that could be correlated with portions of mmmsc proteins while the botswana serum selected six peptides that matched three mmmsc proteins. a single c <dig> igg <dig> peptide matched mmmsc glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  which was also identified by one c <dig> iga peptide. four peptides that were isolated with c <dig> igg <dig> matched the abc transporter, substrate-binding component protein . this protein was also identified by the igg from mali  and igg <dig> and iga from the botswana serum pool. glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase  was selected by peptides from both c <dig> and botswana serum igg <dig>  three of the botswana iga peptides matched to the mycoplasmal prolipoprotein b  amino acid sequence. this protein was also selected with both the c <dig> and botswana igg <dig> serum antibodies. the pts system, glucose-specific iibc component  was identified by four peptides .

expression and antigenicity of mmmsc polypeptides
given the difficulty of easily expressing recombinant mycoplasmal proteins due to codon usage, a short list of genes to be expressed in e. coli was compiled. based on predetermined selection criteria discussed below and using algorithms for antigenicity and surface location together with knowledge of their established characteristics, this list comprised the abc transporter abc, gapn, glpo, lppb and ptsg. site-directed mutations allowed 62% of the abc transporter abc , 96% of glpo  and 61% of lppb  to be expressed. fifty percent of gapn  and 38% of the ptsg  polypeptides could be expressed without mutating .

four of the resulting recombinant polypeptides were found in the e. coli insoluble pellet fraction. their mrs were within the range expected from their amino acid sequences. the calculated mrs were: abc transporter abc, mr ~ <dig> kda; gapn, mr ~ <dig> kda; glpo, mr ~ <dig> kda; and lppb, mr  <dig> ~kda . ptsg was isolated from the soluble fraction using nickel chelation, but it manifested in page as two bands with mrs ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> kda .

the pool of the seven sera obtained from the botswana outbreak was also used in immunoblotting. the pool reacted with the expressed abc and lppb polypeptides . the ptsg polypeptide bands were probed separately with serum obtained from an experimental infection. this immunoblot, however, showed multiple bands that apparently reacted with the pooled sera .

discussion
when a pathogen infects an animal, its epitopes leave an "imprint" in the form of a spectrum of disease-specific antibody paratopes in the serum. most animals are therefore likely to have antibodies directed against a large number of foreign epitopes. the strategy pursued in this study was to use this complex mixture of antibodies to select binders from a limited repertoire of sequences derived from the genome of mmmsc, thereby focussing the phage display selection process on relevant epitopes. these binders were matched to open reading frames present in the genome. unlike immunoblotting, this approach also identified the genes that coded for the antigenic proteins.

the fragmented genome library covered approximately 97% of the mycoplasmal genome. while adequate for its purpose, it cannot, however, be considered to have been completely random since among the  <dig> proteins encoded in the genome of mmmsc type strain pg <dig>   <dig>  contain at least one ugatrp codon, which is read as stop codon in e. coli. moreover, the frequency of ugatrp codons in coding sequences of mmmsc genes is relatively high:  <dig> % in contrast to  <dig> % of uggtrp codons. this means that epitopes containing such stops could be disrupted. moreover, in a phage display system, the secreted phages would be unlikely to display large oligopeptides or those that resisted being transported through the bacterial membrane or periplasm. the functionality of the library was therefore first tested by selecting peptides with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against a single recombinant mmmsc polypeptide, i.e., the c-terminal proline-rich portion of orf <dig>  the orf <dig> gene product  <cit>  corresponds to the  <dig> aa protein having embl/genbank accession number cae <dig>  <cit> . the orf <dig> antiserum selected a series of overlapping peptides thereby identifying a b cell epitope and confirming that polyclonal serum could specifically select antigenic peptides from the phage displayed repertoire. a further important indication that the peptides had been specifically selected was that prior to panning, only  <dig> % of the sequenced inserts contained in the library were both in-frame and in the correct orientation for translation as mycoplasmal peptides. in contrast, after panning, all were in-frame and without stops. this finding, together with the way in which immunoselection yielded multiple copies of some peptides , provided additional evidence that the strategy was essentially sound.

while  <dig> different mmmsc genes matched sequences selected by phage display, those chosen for expression in e. coli were required to have fulfilled criteria which were considered to have a bearing on their usefulness as possible vaccine antigens. firstly, since the pathogen enters the animal via the nasal passages, preference was given to genes selected by iga from mali and botswana. secondly, only genes that were identified by multiple overlapping copies of each phage displayed peptide qualified. thirdly, peptides that fulfilled the first two criteria, but which were selected with a negative bovine serum were excluded. finally, the protein's likely function or structural position was taken into account with a focus on previously-identified membrane-associated proteins  <cit>  which also fulfilled antigenicity criteria as predicted by bioinformatics analyses. although not excluded as being potentially useful, any overlapping sequences that coded for internally located proteins e.g. the dna gyrase subunit b  were not investigated in this study. applying these criteria allowed us to focus on the abc transporter, substrate-binding component protein , the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , the glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase , the prolipoprotein b  and the pts system, glucose-specific iibc component  for expression in e. coli. by applying these criteria we do not exclude further studies on any of the other apparently antigenic proteins as vaccine or diagnostic targets. even though the proliporotein lppc fulfilled our criteria, some of the peptides which matched the amino acid sequence included sequences of unknown origins which did not align with the target orf .

abc transporter proteins act on a wide variety of substrates that include sugars, peptides, proteins and toxins  <cit> . for example, the atp-binding cassette  transporter gtsabc together with glpo forms part of the glycerol catabolism pathway associated with mmmsc virulence  <cit> . glpo itself has been identified as a significant mmmsc virulence factor  <cit> . gapn, in contrast, may play a role in transcription  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit> . membrane lipoproteins that interact with host cells can stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit>  and are major antigens  <cit> . the lipoprotein  identified by the phage display is found in african and australian strains of mmmsc, but not in the less virulent european strains  <cit> . the ptsg gene, which occurs in duplicate in many mmmsc strains  <cit> , encodes the permease of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system. it has also been implicated in intraclonal antigenic variation  <cit> , a possible factor in the evasion of the host immune response. with the exception of gapn, these proteins are likely to be involved in pathogenicity or to be accessible to b cell receptors. they therefore have potential either in vaccine or diagnostics development. only two of the expressed polypeptides, however, reacted in immunoblots, possibly because their epitopes in the denatured state most faithfully resembled the phage displayed peptides that were originally bound in the selection process. although phage display of necessity identified b cell epitopes, it is not yet clear whether it is this response, or a cell-mediated one based on cd <dig>  <cit> , which is a primarily responsible for protection. the proteins identified using phage display will therefore also need to be tested for their ability to cause primed lymphocytes to proliferate and produce ifnγ.

CONCLUSIONS
constructing a phage library that displays peptides derived from the actual organism of interest made it possible to narrow the search for genes that code for antigenic and hence potentially immunogenic proteins of the mycoplasma that causes cbpp. because of their interaction with antibodies in the serum of infected animals, these proteins may be regarded as potential vaccine targets, in particular those selected using igg <dig> and iga. a model epitope discovery system has shown that many antigenic peptides obtained from such phage libraries have potential as vaccine antigens  <cit> . it may therefore also be worth examining the actual antigenic mmmsc peptides that were selected from the epitope library as possible components of a subunit vaccine. knowing which proteins are antigenic may help to identify targets for generating knockout mutants for use as genetically defined vaccines  <cit> . lastly, phage display was able to identify polypeptides that were recognised in immunoblotting by serum from animals that were affected by a natural disease outbreak. as well as having potential as vaccine antigens, such peptides may be useful diagnostic targets.
