BACKGROUND
in mammals, the early antigen independent phase of b lymphopoiesis takes place in the intersinusoidal spaces in the bone marrow . here, the b cell progeny mature from hematopoietic stem cells  via early lymphoid progenitors , pro-b, pre-b and immature b developmental stages characterized by successive steps in the rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes and consecutive expression of cellular markers  <cit> . using immunohistochemical doublestaining we have revealed earlier that all developmental stages of the b cell lineage in human bm tissue are in close contact with slender cd10+ stromal cells or their extensions  <cit> . this finding correlates with the consensus that b lymphopoiesis is tightly regulated by signals provided by mesenchymal stromal cells and components of the intracellular matrix in the bm microenvironment in vivo  <cit> . however, the elements of this signaling are yet inadequately identified; stromal factors like il  <dig>  flt <dig> ligand  <cit> , il- <dig>  <cit>  and sdf <dig>  <cit>  are essential, but not sufficient for bm b lymphopoiesis  <cit> . clearly, there is a need for further characterization of both the stromal phenotype as well as the autocrine and paracrine factors that participate in the regulation of bm b lympopoiesis.

wnt proteins belong to a large and highly conserved family of secreted, cystein-rich glycoprotein signaling molecules, consisting of  <dig> members. they are likely to act locally because of their limited solubility  <cit>  and tendency to associate with the cell surface extracellular matrix  <cit> . signaling is initiated by wnt proteins binding to receptors of the frizzled family  on the cell surface. this binding is promiscuous and the ligand/receptor specificities are not yet properly determined. depending on particular wnt/fzd combinations, at least three signaling cascades may be activated. most studied is the canonical wnt pathway, which is activated by members of the wnt <dig> class   <cit> . a key regulatory molecule in this pathway is β-catenin, which in the absence of a wnt signal is kept low through continuous phosporylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3β , resulting in a subsequent proteasome dependent destruction of β-catenin. binding of wnt ligands to fzd receptors and coreceptors lrp5/ <dig>  leads to inactivation of gsk3β and thereby accumulation of nonphosphorylated β-catenin, which enter the nucleus. here, β-catenin acts as a coactivator of members of the lymphoid enhancer factor- <dig> /t-cell factor  family of transcription factors to stimulate transcription of wnt target genes  <cit> . activation of wnt signaling can be inhibited by soluble antagonists, including the dickkopf  family and the soluble fzd related proteins   <cit> .

recently, wnt proteins have drawn attention as a set of factors operating in embryonic development, growth regulation of adult tissues and cancer formation  <cit> . moreover, wnt signaling plays a central role in the communication between hsc and stromal cells  <cit>  as well as in several other stem cell niches  <cit> . several observations have established direct roles for wnt signaling in the maturation process where hematopoietic stem cells lose their pluripotency and commit to specific lineages  <cit> . lef- <dig> and fzd <dig> knockout mice show defect b lymphopoiesis  <cit>  and wnt signaling seems to be involved in development of leukemia  <cit>  and malignant myeloma  <cit> . moreover, in murine b lymphopoiesis this signaling pathway has a stimulatory effect on pro-b cells from fetal liver  <cit> . as early b lymphopoiesis in mice and humans to a certain extent shows distinct factor dependency  <cit> , and since fetal and adult lymphopoiesis takes place in different maturation niches, the aim of the present study was to investigate wnt signaling in human bm b lymphopoiesis in more detail. we have examined which wnt signaling pathway molecules that are expressed in b progenitor cells and stromal cells from human bm, and analyzed the regulated expression of several wnt receptors , β-catenin and plakoglobin as well as the central transcription factors lef- <dig> and tcf- <dig> during the early b lymphopoiesis. furthermore, we have investigated the effect of recombinant wnt3a on progenitor b cells. we found that wnt3a induced β-catenin stabilization and inhibited in vitro b lymphopoiesis in a coculture with stromal cells by suppression of initial cell proliferation. thus, canonical wnt signaling may be involved in human bm b lymphopoiesis.

RESULTS
a distinct set of wnt ligands, fzd receptors and wnt antagonists is expressed in b progenitor cells and stromal cells from human bm
previous work has demonstrated expression of wnt5a, wnt2b and wnt10b in pooled human bm populations  <cit> . however, the expression pattern of wnt ligands, fzd receptors and wnt antagonists in human b lineage cells has not been explored. in the absence of available antibodies to detect these large families of proteins, we performed conventional rt-pcr on rna isolated from facs sorted b progenitor cells  pooled from three different donors, using primers designed specifically to detect mrna expression of all known wnt ligands and fzd receptors as well as the wnt antagonists dkk <dig>  dkk <dig>  sfrp1- <dig> and wif <dig> . in b progenitor cells, wnt 2b, 5b, 8a, 10a and  <dig> mrnas were readily detected. interestingly, the wnt <dig> pcr product had two bands of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively . the  <dig> bp band represents the full-length form and the  <dig> bp band represents a possible splice variant lacking exon  <dig>  potentially giving rise to a truncated wnt <dig> form. in addition, expression of several other wnt mrnas was detectable, however, less readily . the fzd receptors showed on average much higher mrna expression levels than the wnts, where fzd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mrnas were easily detectable in the b progenitor population, as demonstrated by strong pcr bands. fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> mrna expression was also demonstrated, but at lower levels than the other fzds . we also detected expression of the wnt antagonists dkk <dig>  dkk <dig>  sfrp <dig> and wif <dig> mrnas in the bm b progenitor cells . of these, sfrp <dig> mrna was most readily detectable, suggesting the highest expression level. sfrp <dig> and sfrp <dig> mrnas were variably detected , suggesting low expression levels.

genes expressed , not expressed , variably expressed between experiments, not determined . n =  <dig>  bm b progenitor cells: cd10+igm-cd45+ cells sorted by facs and pooled from three different donors. total rna from human fetal brain was used as control.

rt-pcr performed on rna from bm stromal cells showed expression of wnt2b, wnt5a, wnt5b and wnt8b. mrna expression of wnt9b was also demonstrated in these cells, although at a lower levels. moreover, fzd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mrnas were detected in bm stromal cells, as well as expression of the wnt antagonists dkk <dig>  sfrp <dig> and sfrp <dig> mrnas .

regulated expression of wnt receptors, β-catenin, plakoglobin, lef- <dig> and tcf- <dig> mrnas during human bm b lymphopoiesis
identification of differential expression of wnt signaling molecules during the b lymphopoiesis may reveal at which window in the process wnt signaling is active. thus, using quantitative real-time pcr, we examined the expression of a selection of wnt receptors, β-catenin, plakoglobin and transcription factors in facs sorted human bm b lineage cells representing different maturation levels; elp cells , pro-b cells , large pre-b cells , small pre-b  and immature b cells . due to limited number of cells, expression analysis in elp cells was restricted to seven out of ten mrnas.

the results showed regulation of several of the important wnt-signaling molecules, and different expression profiles were recognizable . mrna levels for the plasma membrane receptors lrp <dig>  lrp <dig>  fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> dropped considerably as the cells develop from small pre-b cells into immature b cells. furthermore, fzd <dig> mrna levels were strongly up-regulated as the cells commit to the b lineage , with a further up-regulation as the cells differentiate to pre-b cells. fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> mrna levels, on the other hand, seemed to increase somewhat throughout the differentiation, with highest levels in small pre-b and immature b cells. in small pre-b cells, the mrna levels of lrp <dig> and fzd <dig> were about two-fold higher than in the large cycling pre-b cells. the expression levels of all receptors were low compared to the expression levels of e.g. lef- <dig> and β-catenin, indicating relative low mrna expression levels. fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> mrnas were not detectable with the amount of rna template used in these assays.

the mrna expression of β-catenin and plakoglobin showed little variation as the cells differentiate. β-catenin mrna was evenly expressed in elp, pro-b, large pre-b and immature b, with a small increase  in small pre-b cells. plakoglobin mrna levels, in contrast, decreased 2-fold as the cells became large pre-b cells .

lef- <dig> and tcf- <dig> mrna expression is highly regulated during the early b lymphopoiesis, as shown previously by microarray analysis . our results showed a strong up-regulation of lef- <dig> mrna as the cells commit to the b lineage, and the expression was kept continuously high until the cells become immature b cells, where the level was reduced to the same as in uncommitted progenitors. here, low lef- <dig> expression was further confirmed by the absence of lef- <dig> protein in b lymphocytes from peripheral blood . the relative tcf- <dig> mrna levels, on the other hand, were high in both elp and pro-b, and decreased  as the cells passed through ig rearrangement  . it should be noted that the lef- <dig> mrna expression was detected 5– <dig> cycles earlier than the tcf- <dig> mrna expression, indicating that lef- <dig> mrna is much more abundant than tcf- <dig> mrna.

wnt3a induces β-catenin stabilization and accumulation in bm b progenitor cells
our data demonstrated that human bm b progenitor cells express a set of central players in the canonical wnt signaling pathway, potentially allowing a wnt signal to be conveyed. to further examine whether b progenitor cells could respond to treatment with wnt proteins, we looked for the stabilization and subsequent accumulation of the vital signaling molecule β-catenin in cd10+ b progenitor cells. when these cells were treated with wnt3a, the amount of β-catenin increased substantially compared to the very low levels in untreated cells . although there were some donor variations, the results showed that the b progenitor cells are able to receive and communicate a signal from the wnt pathway.

wnt3a inhibits human in vitro b lymphopoiesis
having identified expression of central molecules in the canonical wnt pathway in bm b progenitor cells, we performed two variants of b lymphopoiesis assays to investigate whether wnt signaling  had a functional effect on b lymphopoiesis in vitro. both assays were based on coculture with the murine stromal cell line ms- <dig>  in assay  <dig> hematopoietic progenitor cells  were tested for their capacity to develop into b lineage cells, whereas in assay  <dig> b progenitor cells were measured for survival and expansion. at the endpoint of the assays, each sample was subjected to quantitative flow cytometry and the total number of cells positive for the pan b cell marker cd <dig> was measured. in assay  <dig>  analysis of the differentiation marker cd <dig> was included.

initial analyses demonstrated that wnt3a had an inhibitory effect when bm hpc  were grown on stromal cells for  <dig> weeks at conditions that favored b lymphopoiesis . the number of cd19+ cells in the samples treated with wnt3a was  <dig> times less than the number measured in the control samples . the inhibited b lymphopoiesis could result from wnt3a suppressing differentiation of the hsc pool found in the hpc population  <cit> , an indirect effect mediated by the stromal cells  <cit> , or, alternatively, wnt3a could target more committed lymphoid progenitor cells. to examine the latter possibility in more detail, we tested whether wnt3a acted on later stages of in vitro b lymphopoiesis. bm b progenitor cells  were grown on stromal cells in the presence of wnt3a or medium only for  <dig> weeks . in accordance with the results from the assays using hpc, it was demonstrated on average near 50% reduction in the total number of cd19+ cells in samples treated with wnt3a compared with control . when added every third day, both sfrp <dig> and dkk <dig> were able to counteract the effect of wnt3a almost completely, demonstrating a specific effect of wnt3a on in vitro b lymphopoiesis . similar results were obtained using wnt3a protein from another source; wnt3a conditioned medium . moreover, the effect was independent of the source of stromal cells as the use of primary human bm stromal cells  as supportive layer did not change the outcome of the experiment .

to check whether wnt3a affected distinct early b subpopulations differently, the cells in assay  <dig> were additionally analyzed for expression of the cd <dig> differentiation marker to distinguish between pro-b and pre-b cells. the relative frequency of cd34+ cells  decreased from  <dig> % before culturing , to approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % after one and two weeks of culturing, respectively. this decrease was independent of treatment with or without wnt3a . furthermore, separation of the pre-b population into large cycling and small resting pre-b cells by surface expression of cd <dig>  <cit>  revealed inhibitory effect of wnt3a on all subpopulations . thus, we conclude that wnt3a does not affect the relative proportions of different bm b subpopulations, but has a general inhibitory effect on pro-b, pre-b and immature b cells in a stroma coculture.

bm cd10+ cells were cultured on a layer of the murine stromal cell line ms- <dig> in the presence of wnt3a-conditioned medium  or control-conditioned medium , or on a layer of human bone marrow stromal cells  in the presence of rmwnt3a or control medium. the numbers in the table represent the mean of duplicate wells ± sd. *number of cd19+ cells in wells containing wnt3a divided by number of cells in wells containing control-medium.

wnt3a inhibits bm b progenitor cell division in vitro
the inhibitory effect of wnt3a on in vitro b lymphopoiesis could be explained by increased apoptosis, an inhibitory effect on proliferation, or both. however, measurements of apoptosis in cells cultured without stromal cells for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days showed no effect of wnt3a , suggesting an effect on proliferation only. to verify this, we used high-resolution cell division tracking to study the initial effects of wnt3a on b progenitor cells grown on a stromal layer. sorted cfse labeled cd10+ b progenitor cells were cocultured with ms- <dig> for  <dig> days in the presence of wnt3a or medium only, and examined for the number of cell divisions by flow cytometry as well as the surface markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  the data clearly demonstrated that wnt3a inhibited the initial divisions of b progenitor cells taking place in the coculture . when gating for pro-b cells  and pre-b cells  separately, we found that wnt3a inhibited proliferation of both these populations in a dose-dependent manner . this effect was blocked by the wnt antagonist sfrp <dig> .

discussion
several studies have identified the canonical wnt pathway as a regulator of the homeostasis of human and murine hsc and hematopoietic progenitor cells  <cit> . furthermore, knockout studies  in mice have indicated a central role for wnt signaling in b lymphopoiesis  <cit> . the wnt pathway also seems to be involved in development of leukemia  <cit> . in the present work, we wanted to study in more detail the implications of canonical wnt signaling in human bm b lymphopoiesis. here, we describe that a set of wnt ligands, fzd receptors and wnt antagonists is expressed in bm b progenitor cells, allowing a wnt signal to be conveyed and modulated in these cells. we demonstrate regulated expression of several wnt receptors, β-catenin and plakoglobin as well as the transcription factors lef- <dig> and tcf- <dig> mrnas during early differentiation steps in the b cell lineage, supporting the hypothesis that wnt signaling is active in bm b lymphopoiesis. furthermore, we show that canonical wnt signaling, as measured by the accumulation of β-catenin levels, is induced in human bm b progenitor cells. finally, we demonstrate that wnt3a inhibits human stromal dependent b lymphopoiesis and that this effect is a consequence of decreased cell proliferation.

we show that cd10+ human b progenitor cells express a set of wnt ligand mrnas , of which wnt <dig> is of particular interest, since this gene is activated by the e2a-pbx <dig> translocation in some cases of acute lymphocytic leukaemia   <cit> . however, several pre-b leukemia cell lines studied  <cit>  do not express wnt <dig>  suggesting a distinct role for this factor in early b lymphopoiesis that is turned off during leukemiagenesis, except in cases where wnt <dig> is aberrantly activated by the e2a-pbx <dig> fusion protein. further, we demonstrate that primary bm stromal cells express mrna of several wnt ligands, including wnt2b, wnt5a, wnt5b, wnt8b and wnt9b. this is partly in accordance with previous studies  <cit> . taken together, these results show that both hematopoietic cells and the supporting stromal cells may produce wnt ligands. different wnt ligands may have distinct effects during early b lymphopoiesis, which is a topic for future investigations.

so far, only scarce knowledge is available about both ligand specificity and tissue-restricted expression of the fzd receptors. in our studies we found expression of a wide range of fzd receptor mrnas, including fzd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in bm b progenitor cells. compared to the wnt mrnas, these are more readily detectable, indicating higher expression levels, which suggests that wnt-signaling is important for b progenitor cells. real-time pcr assays demonstrated differential expression of several fzd receptor mrnas, including fzd <dig> and fzd <dig>  which are strongly down-regulated as the cells become immature b cells. notably, lrp <dig> and lrp <dig> mrnas showed a similar down-regulation. furthermore, both fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> are up-regulated as the cells commit to the b cell lineage and go through differentiation. interestingly, fzd9-/- mice show a depletion of developing b cells in the bm, particularly in the cycling pre-b population  <cit> . in contrast to this, our results show that the large cycling pre-b cells express lower levels of lrp <dig>  lrp <dig>  fzd <dig>  fzd <dig>  β-catenin and plakoglobin than the small resting pre-b cells. although one should be cautious in trying to predict functional consequences from mrna expression data, this trend suggests that wnt signaling is not likely to be involved in a positive regulation of cycling of the large pre-b cells after ig heavy chain rearrangement. and even though the absolute expression levels of the receptor mrnas are low, these data suggest that during a narrow window of the development comprising pro- and pre-b cells, b progenitor cells might be target for wnt signaling through these receptors.

to be able to convey a wnt-signal, the cells have to express either of the two important molecules, β-catenin or plakoglobin. our results show that levels of β-catenin mrna change little during the differentiation. although it has been demonstrated that levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin protein may vary throughout the development of thymocytes  <cit> , these variations may not necessarily be reflected by the mrna levels. in fact, as β-catenin is needed both for signaling purposes as well as for adhesion purposes, the mrna levels may have to be kept relatively stable. plakoglobin mrna, on the other hand, decreases after the pro-b differentiation level. this corresponds to the observations made in developing murine thymocytes  <cit> , where plakoglobin is down-regulated at the level of immature single positive thymocytes, suggesting that plakoglobin may play a central, but hitherto unexplored role in conveying a wnt signal during lymphopoiesis. in fact, the lack of effect of knocking down β-catenin in early hematopoiesis, including b and t lymphopoiesis  <cit> , prompted the authors to suggest that plakoglobin may stand-in for β-catenin in this respect.

the lef-1/tcfs are directly activated by canonical wnt signaling, and lef- <dig> knockout mice show defects in pro-b cell proliferation and survival  <cit> . however, it cannot yet be ruled out that this effect might be a result of abolishment of the repressive functions or other non-wnt related activities of lef- <dig>  <cit> . here, we have verified microarray data showing regulation of lef- <dig> and tcf- <dig> during b lymphopoiesis . interestingly, it has been reported that lef- <dig> is a target gene for the b lymphopoiesis key transcription factor pax- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, lef- <dig> interacts with pax- <dig> and c-myb to activate the rag- <dig> promoter  <cit> , but the accurate role of lef- <dig> in b lymphopoiesis is still elusive. in contrast to lef- <dig>  we found tcf- <dig> mrna levels to be high in elp and pro-b cells, and lower in the more mature pre-b and immature b populations. although expressed at lower levels, one could speculate that tcf- <dig> steps in for lef- <dig> in the earliest lymphoid progenitors before lef- <dig> is properly switched on, potentially in conveying a wnt signal or, alternatively, in acting as a transcription repressor of b lineage genes before commitment. these are topics for further studies.

wnt antagonists play important roles in preventing or fine tuning the wnt signal  <cit> . our data show expression of the wnt antagonists dkk <dig>  dkk <dig>  sfrp <dig> and wif <dig> mrnas in b progenitor cells. dkk <dig>  sfrp <dig> and sfrp <dig> were expressed in bone marrow stromal cells. of these factors, dkk <dig> in particular is known to be involved in a feedback loop to adjust or shut down canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . it is likely that these factors are important in adjusting the incoming wnt signals in the bone marrow microenvironment, where several cell types are able to express a wide range of ligands and wnt receptors.

the inhibitory effect of wnt3a on the generation and cell division of b progenitor cells in vitro, both with regard to pro- and pre-b cells, is in contrast to several reports on the functional effects of canonical wnt signaling in mice. both in murine hsc  <cit> , developing thymocytes  <cit>  and a wide range of cancer cells  <cit> , elevated levels of β-catenin lead to increased cell proliferation. furthermore, in fetal murine pro-b cell  <cit> , wnt3a conditioned medium leads to increased brdu incorporation. our divergent results may be due to different species, microenvironments and/or cell context. for instance, murine and human b lymphopoiesis require to a certain extent differing factor dependency  <cit> . however, by culturing murine bm b progenitor cells, we have not been able to demonstrate increased cell proliferation in the presence of wnt3a . thus, we suspect the wnt response to be different in fetal and adult b progenitor cells, potentially affected by the cellular microenvironment and/or context. indeed, the fetal pro-b cells are exposed to the microenvironment of the liver and this is very different from that of the bm. for instance several regulators of the wnt pathway are more highly expressed in fetal liver stroma than in bm stroma  <cit> , which suggest that wnt signaling might be regulated in a different manner and have a different role in the fetal liver than in the bm. another important aspect that has to be taken into consideration, is that different wnt ligands, although able to activate canonical wnt signaling, indeed show distinct activities  <cit> . in addition there may also be species and location differences. however, as mentioned above, cobas et al have demonstrated a lack of an essential role for β-catenin in bm hematopoiesis, including proliferation of b lymphocytes  <cit> . thus, in contrast to findings in the fetal liver, our results may very well represent a physiological situation in the adult organism, where wnt signaling via β-catenin is not essential for b lymphocytes, but may be used to fine tune the delicate balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis taking place during early bm b lymphopoiesis.

in support of our data on an inhibitory effect of wnt3a on cell division, it has been reported that canonical wnt signaling hampers fibroblast cell proliferation through cell cycle blocks, potentially mediated via p <dig>  <cit> . moreover, wnt signaling inhibits proliferation and regulates cell-cycle arrest at distinct stages of development in drosophila wing development  <cit> . thus, it is likely that the cellular context, in some cases represented by the ability of a central regulatory molecule like p <dig> to respond, will affect how the cells react to vital stimuli like wnt. it has been speculated that aberrant p <dig> is necessary to convey the strong tumor promoting effect of abnormal wnt signaling seen in colon cancer  <cit> . it is also interesting that wnt5a has been found to inhibit b cell proliferation and can function as a tumor suppressor in hematopoietic tissue, albeit via the non-canonical wnt/ca2+ pathway  <cit> .

we show expression of wnt2b, 5b, 8a, 10a and  <dig> in bm cd10+ cells and of wnt2b, wnt5a, wnt5b, wnt8b and wnt9b mrnas in human primary bms cells. further we demonstrate that wnt3a acts directly on b progenitor cells by increasing the levels of β-catenin, suggesting that the microenvironment may use wnt signaling to regulate the fate of developing b lymphocytes. yet, we cannot exclude that the functional effect of wnt3a on in vitro b lymphopoiesis is indirect and mediated via the stromal cells, as observed for in vitro hematopoiesis  <cit> . the bm microenvironment is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells including fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells and osteoblasts, all derived from a common mesenchymal precursor  <cit> . in particular, the role of wnt signaling in adipogenesis may be relevant here, as it has been demonstrated that wnt10b  <cit>  inhibits adipogenesis, and there seems to be a positive correlation between adipogenesis and hematopoiesis  <cit> . this emphasizes the complexity of the interactions in the b lymphopoiesis maturation niche and opens for the possibility that b progenitor cells may manipulate the stromal support via these wnt factors. however, it is not uncommon in developmental niches that morphogenic signals have the potential to act on several cells in the microenvironment. therefore, it has been suggested that wnt signaling might influence the hscs both directly and indirectly by maintenance of the cellular elements of the stem cell niche  <cit> . in line with this theory, several studies have demonstrated expression of multiple wnt mrnas in thymocytes and the thymic microenvironment. it is likely that particular wnts serve distinct roles, thus, cell specific effects may be achieved by "playing the wnt repertoire" as well as through combinations with other signaling events.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated mrna expression of several wnt ligands, fzd receptors and wnt antagonists in human bm b progenitor cells and regulated expression of fzd receptors and co-receptors, β-catenin, plakoglobin, lef- <dig> and tcf- <dig> mrna in these cells during differentiation. furthermore, we find that wnt3a induced an accumulation of β-catenin in the bm b progenitor cells and inhibition of in vitro b lymphopoiesis. these results suggest the wnt/β-catenin pathway as a negative regulator of human stromal dependent b lymphopoiesis. this is in contrast to observations on wnt effects in fetal murine pro-b cells, and may represent a distinction between the fetal liver and adult bm microenvironments.
