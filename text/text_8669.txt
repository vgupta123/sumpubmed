BACKGROUND
the human ntereronnducibleransembrane  genes were originally identified by their differential response to stimulation by interferon  <cit> , mediated by interferon-stimulated response elements . the family consists of five genes , ifitm <dig> ifitm <dig> ifitm <dig> and ifitm10) all on chromosome  <dig> . all five genes encode proteins with 125– <dig> amino acids and two transmembrane domains and ifitm <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> have isres just 5' to their start codons  <cit> . numerous biological roles have been attributed to ifitm <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> but little is known of the roles of ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig> in humans. ifitm <dig> is expressed by leukocytes and endothelial cells, has anti-proliferative effects and promotes homotypic cell adhesion  <cit> . ifitm <dig> also inhibits cell proliferation  <cit> , while ifitm <dig> induces both cell cycle arrest and subsequent p53-independent apoptosis in numerous cell lines  <cit> . ifitm proteins are also important components of the interferon-mediated innate immune system, and interest in these proteins has increased recently with the discovery that ifitm <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> offer protection against numerous viruses, including influenza a, dengue and hiv  <cit> . they may also act as tumor suppressors because of their ability to control the cell cycle. supporting this idea, cells transitioning from a normal to a pre-malignant state often exhibit abnormal ifitm expression  <cit> .

the ifitm gene family has been well characterised in mice. ifitm <dig> , the first murine ifitm gene to be characterised, was identified by a screen for genes expressed specifically in early primordial germ cells   <cit>  and also in a subtractive cdna screen comparing migrating pgcs with inner cell mass cells  <cit> . ifitm <dig> is on mouse chromosome  <dig>  together with ifitm <dig> , ifitm <dig> , ifitm <dig> , ifitm <dig>   <cit>  and ifitm <dig> , whereas ifitm <dig>  is on mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . murine ifitm genes encode proteins with 104– <dig> amino acids and two transmembrane domains. ifitm1- <dig> and − <dig> also have isres  <cit> . mouse ifitm1- <dig> and − <dig> genes are not respectively orthologous to human ifitm1- <dig> and − <dig> genes, and sequence comparisons between human and mouse ifitm genes suggest that duplication of the ifitm genes occurred independently in human and mouse lineages  <cit> .

ifitm <dig> was renamed bone restricted ifitm-like protein  because its expression in both humans and mice is restricted to bone, especially osteoblasts, and functional studies in mice suggest a role in bone matrix mineralisation and maturation  <cit> . nothing is known of the functions of ifitm6- <dig> or − <dig>  during murine embryonic development, ifitm <dig> is expressed in the extraembryonic and embryonic mesoderm until the mesoderm differentiates  <cit> . ifitm <dig> is ubiquitously expressed from e <dig> , and ifitm <dig> expression mirrors the development of the germ cell lineage: it is expressed in the proximal epiblast from e <dig>  and its expression is gradually restricted to pgcs as gastrulation proceeds  <cit> . ifitm <dig> and − <dig> are not expressed in the embryo between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit>  but ifitm <dig> is expressed from e <dig>  in developing bone  <cit> .

ifitm <dig> expression delineates cells competent to become pgcs as early as e <dig>  and it may have a role in germ cell development, possibly by promoting the formation of a discrete cell population that distinguishes presumptive pgcs from somatic cells via homotypic cell adhesion  <cit> . ifitm <dig> and − <dig> may also control pgc migration. application of ectopic ifitm <dig> and − <dig> or silencing of ifitm <dig> via short hairpin rna  knockdown in embryos results in abnormal pgc migration  <cit> . ifitm <dig> could also be required for somite epithelialisation and formation of paraxial mesoderm, as these processes are defective when ifitm <dig> is silenced in vivo by rna interference  <cit> . knockdown of ifitm <dig> in osteoblast cell lines in vitro results in reduced bone mineralisation, implicating ifitm <dig> in matrix mineralisation and maturation  <cit> . mice homozygous null for ifitm <dig> have smaller skeletons than heterozygous or wild type mice but their relatively mild phenotype suggests that the function of ifitm <dig> can be compensated for by some other factor  <cit> . the possibility of redundancy of ifitm genes is supported by another study in which the locus containing the ifitm cluster  was deleted by floxing out a 120-kb region. the resulting mice, even those homozygous for the deletion, apparently developed normally and were fully fertile, suggesting that these ifitm genes are not essential for normal germline development or any other developmental process  <cit>  and that their roles can be compensated for by other genes.

the studies described above focused on human or mouse ifitms, and aside from a rudimentary description of ifitm genes in the cow and rat  <cit> , the only other published descriptions of ifitm genes are for the electric eel  <cit>  and trout  <cit> . interest in ifitms in humans has increased with the discovery of their roles as anti-viral agents and as markers of cancer and inflammatory diseases  <cit> . such roles have not been described in the mouse, in which the main focus on ifitms has been with respect to their role in the development of the germ cell lineage. the lack of sequence conservation of ifitms between human and mouse suggests that their roles may vary between species. marsupials diverged from eutherians approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and the australian and south american marsupials have evolved independently since the break-up of gondwana approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . comparing marsupial and eutherian ifitm genes will provide new information on the conservation and evolution of this gene family in mammals. this study therefore describes ifitm genes in two marsupial species, the australian tammar wallaby macropus eugenii  and the south american short-tailed grey opossum monodelphis domestica  and compares them with existing genomic databases.

RESULTS
marsupial ifitms
the tammar and opossum genomes each have five ifitm paralogues . tammar ifitm genes identified were ifitma <dig> , ifitma <dig> , ifitmb , ifitm <dig>  and ifitm <dig> , encoding predicted protein sizes of  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. opossum ifitms identified were ifitma, ifitmb <dig> ifitmb <dig> , ifitm <dig>  and ifitm <dig> , encoding predicted protein sizes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. the only evidence of an opossum orthologue to tammar ifitma is a short  sequence  in the opossum trace archives that contains both coding exons. there are several gaps in the current opossum genome assembly  within the ifitm locus, so ifitma may well be located within the ifitm cluster.

marsupial ifitms contain two exons and encode two transmembrane domains. the highest level of sequence conservation occurs within the first transmembrane domain and in between the two transmembrane domains , similar to eutherian ifitm genes. conservation of ifitm protein sequences both between and within the two marsupial species is quite low  with the exception of the comparisons listed in table  <dig>  the motif aggaaatagaaact is an interferon stimulated response element  in human ifitm <dig> <cit>  and tammar ifitma <dig> and ifitma <dig> both have an identical putative isre  located close  to the start of their open reading frames. no such motifs were identified in the other tammar ifitms or in any of the opossum ifitms, although minimal 5′ sequence is available for opossum ifitma.

screening of the tammar bac library with probes against ifitma <dig> and ifitm <dig> yielded two positive clones. sequencing of the ifitma2-positive bac clone showed that ifitma <dig>  -a <dig>  -b and − <dig> are clustered together within a  <dig>  kb region and share the same orientation . using fluorescence in situ hybridisation , the ifitm cluster was localised to chromosome 5q and ifitm <dig> to chromosome 2p . the chromosomal location of the opossum ifitm genes is unknown but at least ifitmb <dig>  -b <dig> and − <dig> are clustered, whereas ifitm <dig> is not within the main ifitm gene cluster. the location of ifitma relative to the ifitm cluster is unknown.

many of the human and some of the mouse ifitm genes have multiple transcripts, which differ either in their 5′, 3′ or both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions . northern blots were attempted for each tammar ifitm gene but were unsuccessful ; probes to ifitma <dig> and -a <dig> cross-reacted with each other whereas no distinct bands were obtained for ifitmb- <dig> or − <dig>  despite the use of multiple tissue samples and different probes. therefore each tammar ifitm gene was used to search the tammar transcriptome and est  databases  <cit> . no transcripts representing ifitm <dig> or ifitm <dig> were identified. two sequences containing at least the second exon and the polya signal of ifitma <dig> and one for ifitmb were obtained and all supported the 3′ utr identified by the bac sequencing. there were four matches for ifitma <dig>  with two supporting a short 3′ utr and the other two suggesting longer 3′ utrs, only one of which contained a polya signal. thus, ifitma <dig> appears to have several transcripts. a similar analysis for ifitma <dig> also suggests several transcripts – whether these differ in the length of their 5′ or 3′ utrs or contain additional exons upstream of the ones presented here is not known. the human and mouse genomes also each contain several ifitm processed pseudogenes. searching the tammar genomic database  <cit>  using tammar ifitm genes yielded one match for each gene, and in each instance this sequence contained an intervening intron.

the expression of ifitm genes in the tammar was examined in adult tissues and also in peri-gastrulation and fetal stages by rt-pcr. in adult organs, ifitma <dig>  -a <dig> and -b were widely expressed , whereas ifitm <dig> is only expressed in bone. ifitma <dig>  -a <dig> and -b were also the most widely expressed  ifitm genes during embryonic and fetal development , although ifitmb expression was very low in bilaminar  yolk sac . ifitm <dig> expression was also absent from the bys and was not detectable until slightly later in development, during early somitogenesis. ifitm <dig> was not expressed at any pre-natal stage examined.

ifitms in other taxa
ifitm genes were identified in representatives from all seven major vertebrate classes . there is no genome database available for urodelian amphibians and only a rudimentary one for chondrichthyes  so results in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s  <dig> are based on est data. an ifitm protein has also been described in the cartilaginous electric ray torpdeo marmorata <cit> . only one small ifitm protein of approximately  <dig> amino acids was found for the lamprey  and this aligns to ifitm <dig> and −3-like ifitm genes from the turkey, zebrafish and frog with a higher score than it does to any ifitm <dig> or − <dig> orthologue . ifitm <dig> appears to have arisen in bony fish, and ifitm <dig> in tetrapods. the apparent lack of either of these genes in urodeles probably reflects the paucity of genomic data currently available.

a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree constructed using ifitm amino acid sequences showed four distinct ifitm clusters . two of these contained orthologues of ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig> respectively from many different species, the third and fourth clusters contained the remaining eutherian and marsupial ifitms respectively. the ifitm <dig> orthologues are the most highly conserved, exhibiting > 61% amino acid similarity between all species . the ifitm <dig> orthologues share > 32% amino acid similarity .

discussion
this study is the first to describe ifitm genes in marsupials. marsupial ifitm genes are similar to those in eutherians with respect to their size , structure  and their arrangement within a gene cluster. it also appears that like in mouse and human, there may be multiple transcripts for some of the tammar ifitm genes. two tammar ifitm genes have a potential isre, similar to eutherian ifitms. the apparent lack of any isres in opossum ifitms is probably an artifact of lack of sufficient 5′ sequence for ifitma, rather than an actual absence of this motif. isres may not be essential for ifitm expression; murine ifitm <dig> has two isres  <cit>  but mutation of both motifs does not affect the expression of ifitm <dig> in the gastrula stage mouse embryo or in fetal gonads  <cit> . in the tammar several ifitms are expressed during gastrulation, raising the possibility of a role for ifitm genes in marsupial germ cell development, although localisation of the transcripts is required before any conclusions can be drawn.

although ifitm genes have been annotated in the genomes of numerous mammalian species , ifitms from only three mammalian species, the human, mouse and rat, were used for the current comparison. the mouse and human were chosen both because their ifitms have been well studied and also because these species diverged from each other about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , approximately the same length of time as the split between australasian and south american marsupials  <cit> . the rat was included to allow comparison of ifitm genes between two closely related species.

phylogenetic analysis of ifitms in various vertebrates has been undertaken previously  <cit>  but the current analysis has expanded the data, including all identified marsupial ifitms and also amphibian ifitms. in contrast to  <cit> , we also included ifitm <dig> paralogues. the definition of an ifitm within the literature is vague. all ifitms contain the human leukocyte antigen cluster of differentiation cd <dig>  yet not all proteins that contain cd <dig> are ifitms. the sequences classified as ifitms by  <cit>  for their analysis included cd225-containing genes that had  <dig> exons and encoded proteins with a transmembrane domain. these proteins range from 102– <dig> amino acids in length, with a median length of  <dig> amino acids. marsupial, chicken, lizard and rat ifitm <dig> orthologues all consist of  <dig> exons and encode proteins 120– <dig> amino acids long. mice and humans each have several ifitm <dig> transcripts, which vary in the number of exons they contain, similar to other ifitm paralogues in these species. thus, we decided to include ifitm <dig> paralogues as bona fide ifitm family members.

our phylogenetic analysis showed that only ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig> have clear orthologues in a range of vertebrate taxa. the orthologous relationships among other ifitm genes are often not very clear. a previous phylogenetic analysis of ifitm genes concluded that there is a high probability of primate-specific gene duplications  <cit> , although concerted evolution cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the higher sequence similarity between paralogues rather than orthologues for many of the ifitms. the low conservation among ifitm genes, even between species from the same subclass, suggests that either the roles of the different ifitm genes are not conserved between species or, more likely, that there is redundancy between them. the latter idea is strongly supported by an experiment in which the entire ifitm locus was deleted in mice without any apparent effects on normal development  <cit> . in fact, the study by  <cit>  also suggests that at least during embryonic development, the ifitm family itself may be redundant. further work is needed to clarify how critical ifitms are for both embryonic development and general survival. the rapid evolution of ifitms could be linked to their capacity to act as anti-viral agents; frequent mutation and duplications of these genes may act to counteract virus adaptations  <cit> .

the lack of sequence conservation is mirrored by the lack of conservation of the expression patterns of the different ifitm genes between tammar, mouse and human. expression data for human and mouse ifitm genes is available from the unigene expressed sequence tag collection database  <cit>  and some rt-pcr data is also available for the mouse  <cit> . even the expression pattern of the most highly conserved ifitm, the tetrapod-specific ifitm <dig>  differs between the three species although expression is more similar between human and tammar than either of these species are to mouse. in mouse ifitm <dig> is expressed in the brain and spleen, yet it is absent from these tissues in both the tammar  and human. conversely, ifitm <dig> is expressed in bone in tammar and human but not in mouse. the exceptionally high sequence conservation suggests that this gene has an important and conserved function, making it hard to reconcile the apparent lack of conservation in expression patterns. it is also curious that there is almost no information available on this gene in any species: the exception is a brief mention that ifitm <dig> ests are over-represented in the mouse brain  <cit> .

examining the expression of ifitm <dig> in various taxa suggests that both the bone-specific expression of ifitm <dig>  and the specialised role of ifitm <dig> in bone production  <cit>  is a recent adaptation specific to therian mammals. it would be interesting to examine ifitm <dig> expression in tissues from a monotreme mammal but such samples were not available for this study. in zebrafish, in contrast to mammals, ifitm <dig> is absent from bone, and instead is present in the brain, muscle and liver. the chicken est database  <cit>  does not include bone but does show high ifitm <dig> expression in liver, muscle and spleen, with lower levels in the ovary and brain. the expression patterns of ifitm <dig> in reptiles and amphibians are unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has described ifitm gene clusters in two marsupial species and has found evidence to demonstrate that the bone-specific expression of ifitm <dig> is specific to mammals. it is also the first to recognize the exceptionally high sequence conservation of ifitm <dig> between different taxa, which suggests an important and conserved  role for ifitm <dig>  this study also suggests that ifitm genes have acquired many different roles during their evolution in vertebrates.
