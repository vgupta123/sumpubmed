BACKGROUND
thanks to dna microarrays the gene expression profiling can nowadays be extended to a genome-wide analysis. since the first prototypes of the mid nineties  <cit> , microarray technology has advanced considerably in terms of reproducibility and cross-platforms agreement  <cit> . quite some effort was also devoted to the development of data analysis tools, which process the raw experimental fluorescence intensities through background subtraction, normalization and eventually summarization. different microarray platforms, for instance two-color versus single-color arrays, require also different data processing. most of the current algorithms for dna microarrays data analysis  <cit>  rely on complex statistical transformations for the above mentioned preprocessing steps. microscopically based methods  <cit>  offer an interesting alternative to purely statistical approaches. these methods use estimates of physical quantities involved in the underlying microscopic processes, as for instance the hybridization free energy, which measures the transcript-probe affinity. the fluorescent intensities are then linked to gene expression levels by means of thermodynamic functions. input from physics and chemistry is expected to offer a simpler, but still accurate handling of the experimental data.

here we describe a thermodynamic approach for the calculation of gene expression levels from microarray data, which will be referred to as the inverse langmuir method . as will be shown below, the ilm determines changes in the expression level accurately, using a simple computational scheme involving a minimal number of adjustable parameters. in affymetrix genechips  <cit>  transcripts are interrogated by oligo sequences , which are referred to as the probes. the collection of  <dig> to  <dig> probes complementary to the same transcript forms a probe set. the ilm allows for the identification of "outlying" probes, for instance due to a faulty genomic annotation, or a high sensitivity for cross-hybridization. the ilm thus also provides feedback for the improvement of the microarray design.

RESULTS
to assess the quality of the ilm, we use in this paper the publicly available data from gene expression omnibus with number gse <dig>  these data originate from a study  <cit>  of a multi-laboratory comparison of hybridization of the same mrna sample on three different platforms: affymetrix oligo, two-color cdna and two-color oligo arrays. using mixtures of knockout human cell lines two samples were created in which the expression of few genes is expected to be altered. the study  <cit>  focuses on  <dig> genes whose expression level was measured by rt-pcr in both samples, in order to compare the log-fold changes with those obtained from microarray data analysis. here we are concerned only with affymetrix data, which were produced by five different laboratories, with two technical replicates each.

in a microarray hybridization experiment several different types of chemical reactions take place simultaneously. a transcript sequence in solution does not only bind to its complementary probe, but may be involved in, for instance, self-folding, it may bind to other partially complementary transcripts in solution, or to non-complementary probes. a review of the physical chemistry of these processes can be found in ref.  <cit> . the ilm takes into account a subset of these processes. nevertheless, a comparison with rt-pcr data shows that it is an accurate method for the estimation of the fold changes of the transcript concentrations.

with the ilm, we determined the global transcript concentrations in each sample, and from the ratio of concentrations in the two different conditions we obtained the fold-change in concentration. fig.  <dig> shows two plots of the log2-fold change in the concentration for the  <dig> selected genes from the ilm, plotted versus the log2-fold change concentration as measured from rt-pcr . each plot refers to a single laboratory, as each laboratory performed two replicate experiments; the figure shows the log <dig> fold change for each replicate. if the ilm agreed perfectly with the rt-pcr experiments, all data points shown in fig.  <dig> would lie on the diagonal. to assess the accuracy of the ilm, we use the method used by irizarry et al  <cit> : we apply a linear regression line through the data, constrained to cross the origin, and then use as a quality measure the agreement with the ideal value for this slope, which is unity. for a complete comparison of all experimental data, table  <dig> reports the accuracy of the ilm for the five different laboratories. a comparison with the accuracies obtained from robust multiarray analysis  is also shown. table  <dig> presents a list of log <dig> fold changes as obtained from ilm, rma and the rt-pcr data. the performance of the ilm in this test is good.

comparison of accuracies of the inverse langmuir method and robust multi array algorithm for the experimental data of ref.  <cit> . the accuracy is the slope of the regression line as shown in fig.  <dig>  which has zero intercept. the accuracy for the rma is taken from ref.  <cit> . the fourth column reports the rmse in the log <dig> fold changes between the ilm and rt-pcr data. as a check for possible biases in the ilm, we repeated the linear regression, this time allowing for intercepts. the resulting values for these intercepts are reported in column  <dig>  the same column also reports the p-values on the intercept, which show these intercepts are not statistically significant.

table of log <dig> fold changes of the  <dig> genes in the lab  <dig> and lab  <dig> experiments, as obtained from rt-pcr measurements, and from affymetrix experiments analyzed with the ilm and rma. the sub-indices for ilm and rma distinguish the technical replicates of the same oligonucleotide microarray experiment. the gene alox <dig> was not detected in the rt-pcr analysis, hence its ratio is undetermined . this gene was not considered in the accuracy calculation.

to assess the effects of different labs and genes in the analysis, we used a general linear model of the type Δ = gene + lab + gene : lab where Δ is the difference between log <dig> fold changes for rt-pcr and ilm data. a similar analysis was done also for rma data. in both cases the lab and gene-lab interaction effects are not significant. the p-values are for ilm plab =  <dig>  and pgene:lab =  <dig> , while for rma plab =  <dig>  and pgene:lab =  <dig> . the majority of the variation in both methods is explained by the gene effect.

we also performed a more detailed investigation of the performance of individual probes. fig.  <dig> shows the background-subtracted intensities for some of the  <dig> genes for which rt-pcr measurements of expression levels exist. data are plotted as function of rt log = Δg + rt log α, which is calculated from eq. . a perfect agreement of the data with eq.  would imply their alignment along a single line, associated to a single value of the concentration c. in reality some spreading is always observed. the amount of spreading is linked to the accuracy of the determination of the transcript concentration in solution. the central line in the plots corresponds to the median value of the concentration, while the dashed lines are calculated from the median absolute deviation of the logarithm of the individual concentrations. further details on the transcript concentration for each individual probe are given in table  <dig> which presents few examples. the median of all concentrations per probe set and the median absolute deviation  calculated from the logarithm of the concentrations are also given. typically, only few probes deviate strongly from the median concentration, as for instance is the case for probe  <dig> in probe set 202859_x_at, probe  <dig> in probe set 205828_at, and probe  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in probe set 205479_s_at. a narrow spreading  is a signature of an accurate and consistent determination of the concentrations. besides giving an estimate of the concentration, the ilm provides also quality control of the performance of each individual probe in the probe set. for instance, probe  <dig> in the probe set 205828_at gives a systematically higher intensity than what is expected from the langmuir model; this is probably due to cross-hybridization.

examples of individual concentrations  for each of the  <dig> probes of three given probe sets used in the study of ref.  <cit> . the gene symbol, probe set number and laboratory number, following ref.  <cit>  are given. each laboratory performed two replicate experiments  for two different mrna samples . the median value and the median absolute deviation  of the logarithm of the concentrations are also given.

the absolute concentrations in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig> are given in picomolar . the estimated values of the concentration depend in the ilm on some parameters, see ref.  <cit>  and methods. in the present work we have taken these parameters from ref.  <cit> , where they were fitted against affymetrix spike-in data. hence, no adjustment of the parameters is done in the present analysis. however the absolute picomolar values should be interpreted with some care. as hybridization conditions may vary from experiment to experiment, the parameters from ref.  <cit>  may not be fully adequate for the present experiment. a retuning of the parameters should mainly affect the absolute concentration estimates, but not the fold-changes. the agreement between fold-changes of ilm and rt-pcr data indicates that this is plausible.

to evaluate to what extent slight variations in the experimental handling of the microarrays causes fluctuations in the ilm estimates of the transcript concentration, we present in fig.  <dig> a plot of concentration vs. concentration of two replicate experiments performed in the same laboratory; in the left and right panels, laboratory  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. concentrations are calculated from the median of each probe set of eq. . the diagonal line is also traced. in both cases a good degree of correlation is found . the degree of correlation between replicate experiments is an indicator of good quality of the experiments. we note that in fig.  <dig>  a slight unbalance is observed at very low concentrations , which are typically below the biologically relevant range of concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS
most of the current algorithms for oligonucleotide microarray data analysis rely on purely statistical methods and use complex transformations for normalization, background subtraction and summarization  <cit> . due to its importance in many biotechnological applications, dna hybridization when both strands are free in solution has been widely investigated during the past decades . it is therefore natural to seek for an application of the insights obtained during those studies to the case of hybridization in dna microarrays. the advantages of microarray data analysis algorithms based on physico-chemical properties of the underlying hybridization process were indeed emphasized in few studies  <cit> .

here we presented the inverse langmuir method, a new algorithm for affymetrix genechips data analysis which is based upon dna and rna hybridization thermodynamics. the ilm consists of two steps: the background subtraction and the transcript concentration estimation for the background-subtracted intensities. these two steps, which were accurately fine-tuned and tested separately on affymetrix spike-in data in previous publications  <cit> , are here combined into a single algorithm.

to validate the ilm, we applied it to publicly available microarray data from a multi-lab comparison study  <cit>  in which microarray experiments were performed on mrna samples where different expression levels of few genes are induced. the log <dig> fold change between these two samples, as obtained from rt-pcr experiments, agrees well with the log <dig> fold change as obtained with the ilm, indicating that the ilm determines changes in the expression level accurately. a comparison of replicated experiments shows that the ilm is not very sensitive to slight variations in the experimental handling of the microarrays, and hence gives a very good degree of reproducibility. since the ilm yields independent concentration estimates per probe, it allows for the identification of outlier probes. differently from other physico-chemical inspired algorithms  <cit>  the ilm uses a much smaller number of adjustable parameters. this is because the hybridization free energies Δg and Δg' entering in eq.  are obtained from rna/dna and rna/rna tabulated stacking parameters obtained from melting experiments in solution  <cit> .

in the near future, we plan to make a freely available version of the ilm available through .
