BACKGROUND
extreme pathways  of a metabolic network are the irreducible set of vectors that define the basis of the null-space of the network's stoichiometric matrix. every allowable solution to the flux balance equations of a reaction network in steady state, s·ν =  <dig>  can be represented as a non-negative linear combination of the extreme pathway vectors. expas are biochemically and thermodynamically feasible pathways that transform a selection of the given substrates to a selection of allowable products. expas have been extensively used for the analyses of metabolic networks . typically, such analyses used expas to define possible phenotypic states of metabolic networks under different simulation conditions, to identify network redundancy, and to reveal eigenpathways that effectively characterize all relevant physiological states of a metabolic network. modified versions of expa analyses have also been applied to regulatory networks  <cit>  and signaling pathways  <cit> . such applications are still in their infancy and are important research topics. however, as the size of a network increases, the redundancy of the network, that is, the number of different pathways that transform given substrate to given product  <cit> , becomes more apparent, and the number of expas increases rapidly. redundancy also exists in small systems but this can be easily handled and even provide insights to legitimate alternative pathways. as the number of expas increases at a drastic rate, performing insightful analyses using expas become increasingly difficult.

the fact that the set of expas of a biochemical reaction network defines the boundaries of its convex steady-state solution space makes them a valuable tool for metabolic network analysis. further, they emphasize alternative pathways that exist in a network, which may otherwise be overlooked, and that can enrich the understanding of its possible physiological states. however, the increasing details included in reconstructed metabolic networks lead to the combinatorial explosion of the number of expas and their computation time. a method providing a good estimate for the final number of expas for a given system will enable researchers to decide whether expas analysis is a appropriate tool for their objectives.

another method often used for characterizing the steady-state solution space for a biochemical reaction network is known as elementary modes   <cit> . both expa and em analyses require the resulting solution vectors to be non-decomposable and unique. in addition, expa vectors are required to be systemically independent  <cit> . as a result, expas for a system are a minimal set of ems, and the number of expas is less than or equal to the number of ems. since both expas and ems are biochemically and thermodynamically feasible pathways, the number of these pathways cannot be estimated using traditional graph theoretical algorithms, such as the dijkstra's algorithm  <cit> , for finding all shortest paths.

the combinatorial complexity of elementary modes of a network was previously described by klamt et al.  <cit>  by providing an upper-bound for the number of ems. in their work, the authors considered the following combinatoric problem: given a network with n reactions and m metabolites, the maximal number of independent pathways occurs when each possible subset of the reactions consisting of the m metabolites are independent. this maximal number was found to be

in this study, we investigated the relationship between the number of expas for a given network, p = |{pi}|, and its basic network measurements. several network measurements are commonly used in describing the topological features of a network and include connectivity, clustering coefficient, network diameter, and degree distribution  <cit> . the number of expas for a network can vary dramatically under different simulation conditions, that is, different environmental constraints. consequently, basic network information such as the numbers of reactions and metabolites of the network cannot be solely used to provide a meaningful estimate. since expas are connected reactions, we hypothesized that the higher the reaction connections, the larger the number of expas. based on this hypothesis, we demonstrated an exponential relationship between log  and log⁡

RESULTS
the number of extreme pathways , p = |{pi}|, for a metabolic network increases drastically with the complexity and size of the network. an estimate for p for a given network can help one decide whether expa analysis is a feasible tool for one's research objective. in this study, we investigated the relationship between p and a number of factors, θi, formed by simple network measurements such as the incoming and outgoing degree of reactions, d∓ = d∓i

identification of significant contributing factors
we aimed to identify factors that can be used for establishing appropriate estimating functions. desirable factors must be i) easily obtained and ii) specific for a given model. for example, network measurements such as the incoming and outgoing degrees of each reaction, d∓ = d∓i

a number of potential factors for the estimating functions were formed using the aforementioned network measurements . the correlations of these potential factors and p were evaluated using the pearson's product-moment correlation, r, and spearman-rank correlation, ρ. the pearson's correlation is generally used as an indicator for the strength and direction of a linear relationship and is considered to be robust enough to handle non-parametric data. on the other hand, the spearman's correlation describes the monotonic relationship between two variables without making any assumptions about the frequency distribution of the variables. we used both of these correlation coefficients on the original and logged data to avoid misinterpretation due to the wide ranges of data . for the original data, the factor with the highest pearson correlation before was found for θ1=∑i=1rd−id+ici

a good factor for an estimating function must have a high correlation to that is being estimated. we further required that the factor must grow consistently with the number of expas. the rows labelled 'pre-' and 'post-' log show the pearson's correlations, r, between the number of expas and the corresponding factors. these factors were created using the following basic networks measurements: r = reff the number of active reactions given the environmental conditions, d± = d± the incoming/outgoing connectivity of reaction ri, c = c the clustering coefficient of the ith reaction, ℐ

the relationships between log  and equations  and  are displayed in figure  <dig>  in this case, the pearson's correlation before the inclusion of rω was  <dig> , and was improved to  <dig>  after scaling.

similar to the case for θ <dig>  the errors were reduced after scaling . the unscaled estimating function, equation , again, described most of the models  to within a a factor of  <dig> with respect to the actual expa numbers . the inclusion of the scaling factor resulted in less outliers, a better correlation and reduced errors .

performance of estimations functions
the performance of the estimating functions  was tested using an additional  <dig> models. these models were reduced but functional models of the central metabolism derived from reconstructed metabolic networks of  <dig> different organisms, namely h. pylori  <cit> , m. barkeri  <cit> , and h. influenzae  <cit> . all four estimating functions successfully predicted  <dig> out of the  <dig> test models  to within a factor of  <dig> . for all four estimating functions, the number of expas of seven models were overestimated by a factor greater than  <dig> while none were under-estimated beyond that factor. in particular, the estimating function f <dig> yielded the smallest error range for all models. the  <dig> test data points had the highest correlation with f <dig>  as did the  <dig> data points used for its formulation . we concluded that the estimating function f <dig> can typically successfully estimate the number of expas of a metabolic network to within a factor of  <dig>

discussion
the goal for this study was to produce an estimating function using basic network measurements. specifically, we aimed to obtain a function such that only a single factor is used for estimation. in principle, it was possible to use a multivariate  regression method using a number of the factors described in the section 'identification of significant contributing factors'. however, the independence assumption upon which this method is based was not applicable as the factors themselves tend to be highly correlated. furthermore, it would have been difficult to interpret which factors were truly responsible for the increase in p, and would probably lead to inaccurate estimations in test models. here, the most descriptive factor was θ <dig>  which includes the clustering coefficients. the interpretation of the clustering coefficient used in this study is also often used in sociology and biochemical networks . there are other interpretations of the clustering coefficient, such as that described by soffer et al.  <cit> . their definition eliminates degree-correlation biases, thus, quantifying the connectivity amongst the neighbors of a vertex independent to its degree and the degree of its neighbors. it would be interesting to use a similar definition for directed graphs and investigate its effects on expa estimation. additionally, it is possible that other factors may provide a more accurate estimation for the number of expas. however, these factors may only be found by detailed analyses of network structures.

the estimating function given by equation  typically estimated the number of expas of the test models to within a factor of  <dig>  in cases where it failed, it did not under-estimate the number of expas. the version of the e. coli reconstructed network used by klamt et al.  <cit>  was not elementally- and charge-balanced and has since been replaced by updated versions  <cit> . we used a revised version ije660a, which was found to be the closest to what they used, and is publicly available  <cit> , to compare our method with klamt's. when the estimating function was applied to this version, assuming that all reactions were active concurrently,  <dig> ×  <dig> expas were estimated with our method, whereas klamt's method yielded an upper-bound of  <dig> ×  <dig> after disregarding inactive reactions in the unbalanced and smaller model. given that ije660a has  <dig> more reactions and all the reactions are elementally- and charge-balanced, we are confident that our estimating function can also serve as a conservative upper-bound of the number of expas after some adjustments. for larger networks such as the latest published reconstruction of e. coli consisting of  <dig> cited reactions  <cit> , we estimate  <dig> ×  <dig> expas, the human reconstructed network with  <dig> reactions  <cit>  is predicted to have  <dig> expas when all reactions were active concurrently.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated the possibility of estimating with confidence the number of extreme pathways , p, for metabolic networks. our effort concentrated on the use of simple network measurements, namely the incoming and outgoing degrees, d∓i

the set of extreme pathways is the convex basis used for biochemical characterization of the null-space of the stoichiometric matrix for a biochemical reaction network. expa analyses have typically been used to characterize phenotypic states of metabolic networks and identify network redundancy. beyond these uses, the singular value decomposition of the extreme pathway matrix has been used to identify eigenpathways that are capable of characterizing phenotypic states of a system  <cit> . nevertheless, applications such as these require expas to be calculated prior to any analysis. the number of expas is set to increase dramatically with network size and complexity. in particular, with the increase in details of metabolic network reconstructions and the emergence of reconstruction of global transcription/translation networks, new techniques for calculating and analyzing expas are much needed. since the goal of systems biology is to study an organism as a whole, different types of biochemical networks will eventually be combined so that the system can be studied in its entirety. to over-come future computational challenges as well as being equipped with the necessary analytical techniques should become our immediate goal.
