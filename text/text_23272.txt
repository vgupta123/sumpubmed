BACKGROUND
continuum models are used to describe cell migration in a number of contexts including wound repair  and malignant invasion  <cit> . here, we consider a continuum partial differential equation to describe the motion of a population of cells, with cell density c, where x and y are the cartesian coordinates, and t is time. the continuum model allows the cell migration mechanism to involve an undirected  and directed  component. conservation arguments lead to 
  <dig> ∂c∂t=∂∂xd∂c∂x+∂∂yd∂c∂y−∂∂xχ∂s∂xc−∂∂yχ∂s∂yc, 


where d> <dig> is the cell diffusivity, and χ is the tactic sensitivity function. in this keller-segel  <cit>  type model, the tactic flux is proportional to the gradient of some signal, s, and the strength of the tactic response is governed by the tactic sensitivity function, χ  <cit> . setting χ> <dig> represents attraction, since the directed component of the cell flux is in the direction of increasing s. alternatively, setting χ< <dig> represents repulsion. to maintain generality, the cell diffusivity d> <dig> is also written as a function of the signal, s  <cit> . if d is increasing, this model represents an increase in undirected motility with the signal, as in the case of chemokinesis  <cit> . since there is no source/sink term in eq.  we are focusing on cell migration processes on short time scales so that cell proliferation and cell death have a negligible impact on the cell density.

directed cell migration can occur in response to various types of external spatial gradients. in eq.  we have not specified the physical interpretation of s. in a model of chemotaxis s would represent the concentration of a chemical signal, whereas in a model of thermotaxis s would represent the temperature. in a model of electrotaxis s represents the electric potential. in this work we focus on stimulating directed cell migration in an electric field.

electrotaxis plays an important role in guiding epithelial and corneal wound healing processes, and could potentially be used to design novel therapies . while the precise molecular-level mechanisms behind electrotaxis remain unresolved, a common hypothesis is that exposing cells to an electric field leads to changes in plasma membrane potentials  <cit>  with the membrane facing the cathode becoming depolarized, and the membrane facing the anode becoming hyperpolarized  <cit> . in a cell with negligible voltage-gated conductance, the hyperpolarized membrane attracts calcium ions, leading to a contraction of this side of the cell which propels the cell toward the cathode  <cit> . in a cell with voltage-gated calcium channels, the channels near the depolarized side open to allow an influx of calcium ions leading to a rise in the intracellular calcium ion level throughout such a cell. the direction of cell movement in this situation will depend on the balance between the opposing contractile forces  <cit> .

a key question in applying eq.  is to determine the functional forms of d and χ. in many theoretical studies focusing on directed cell movement, an explicit relationship between the tactic response function and the signal, s, is emphasized. often, particularly in more theoretical studies, an argument about saturation of receptor cites on cells is made to suggest that χ ought to be a decreasing function of s, so that dχ/ds< <dig>  <cit> . several putative functional forms have been put forward. for example, relationships such as χ = χ
0/s and χ = χ
0
k /  <dig>  and several others, have been suggested . in contrast, other studies simply adopt a constant χ=χ . under the situation where we treat d and χ as constants, eq.  simplifies to 
  <dig> ∂c∂t=d∂2c∂x2+∂2c∂y2−χ∂∂x∂s∂xc+∂∂y∂s∂yc. 


the advantage of working with eq.  compared to eq. , is that there are just two unknown parameters in eq. , χ and d. in contrast, the more complicated models involving receptor saturation effects can involve six or more unknown parameters .

making a distinction between choosing models where the tactic sensitivity incorporates receptor saturation effect ) and a simpler model where the tactic sensitivity coefficient is constant ) is not obvious unless we are guided by a reasonable quantity of experimental data. from a theoretical point of view, it might be attractive to incorporate receptor saturation dynamics into a mathematical model, but this comes with the trade off that this is typically achieved by introducing a complicated relationship between the tactic sensitivity coefficient and the attractant concentration, which can introduce several unknown parameters into the mathematical model thereby over complicating the process of model calibration  <cit> . to provide some insight into this question, here we analyze a suite of cell migration data. the data we analyze comes from an electrotaxis experiment where the strength of the attraction gradient is carefully varied so that we can analyze both the random component of the cell migration as well as the directed component over a range of applied gradients.

RESULTS
qualitative assessment of trajectory data
cell trajectory data, describing the motion of  <dig> randomly-chosen 3t <dig> fibroblast cells  <cit>   under a range of gradients, ef= <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> mv/mm, within the experimental apparatus  are analysed  <cit> . since 3t <dig> fibroblast cells are known to migrate towards the cathode in these types of experiments  <cit> , the cartesian coordinate axes are aligned so that the positive x-direction points towards the cathode . we note that there is no gradient in the y-direction .

a, under the action of no gradient, shows an approximately symmetric distribution of the end points of the trajectories. in this case the trajectories extend no further than approximately  <dig> μm away from the origin. since these trajectories appear to follow no particular preferred direction, this cells seem to undergo an unbiased migration process. in comparison, the scatter plot in fig. 2
b shows that there is some drift in the positive x-direction when the cells move under the action of a gradient. despite the fact that there is an obvious drift in the positive x-direction in fig. 2
b, there remains some randomness in the distribution of ,y). therefore, under the action of the electric field, these 3t <dig> fibroblast cells move with both a directed and an undirected component. comparing results in fig. 2
b-d confirms that the drift in the positive x-direction increases with the increasing electric field, and there appears to be some randomness in the distribution of cells regardless of the strength of the electric field. to provide more information about the roles of directed and undirected motion in these experiments, we will now interpret this data using a biased random walk model that is related to an advection-diffusion equation.

quantitative assessment of trajectory data
we first quantify the directed component of the motility depicted in fig.  <dig>  estimates of the drift velocity are obtained, in both the x and y directions, for each of the  <dig> trajectories, under the four different gradient conditions. these data are presented as histograms in fig.  <dig>  results in fig. 3
a-b characterize the estimates of v
x and v
y when there is no gradient, and averaging these  <dig> estimates gives us an approximation of the average drift velocity in each direction. this gives 〈v
x〉=−1μm/h and 〈v
y〉=−1μm/h. therefore, the average drift velocity in both directions is approximately zero, as we anticipate intuitively by inspecting the data in fig. 2
a. results in fig. 3
c-h show estimates of v
x and v
y for ef= <dig>  and  <dig> mv/mm, respectively. in each case we see that 〈v
y〉≈0μm/h, which is consistent with the experimental design since there is no gradient in the y direction . in contrast, estimates of 〈v
x〉 increase with ef, as we have 〈v
x〉=− <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> μm/h when ef= <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> mv/mm, respectively. in addition to characterizing the mean drift velocities, 〈v
x〉 and 〈v
y〉, the data in the histograms in fig. 3
a-h show how the individual estimates of v
x and v
y are distributed for each of the  <dig> trajectories considered. a qualitative assessment of these distributions indicates that, for each value of the ef, estimates of v
x and v
y are approximately symmetrically distributed about the mean. furthermore, the spread about the mean appears to be approximately constant for each value of the ef.

given our estimates of 〈v
x〉 and 〈v
y〉 , we now estimate the diffusivity coefficients, d
x and d
y, for each experiment. results showing estimates of d
x and d
y under the application of no gradient are summarised in fig. 3
i-j. averaging our estimates across the  <dig> trajectories we obtain 〈d
x〉= <dig> μm2/h and 〈d
y〉=50μm2/h for the experiments in which there is no gradient. the magnitude of these estimates of cell diffusivity are consistent with previous estimates 3t <dig> fibroblast cells obtained using single cell trajectory data  <cit> . additional estimates of d
x and d
y, and 〈d
x〉 and 〈d
y〉 are shown in fig. 3
k-p for cell migration under the influence of gradients of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mv/mm, respectively. for each of these data sets we have 〈d
x〉≈〈d
y〉, indicating that the random motility coefficient is isotropic. furthermore, unlike our estimates of 〈v
x〉, our estimates of 〈d
x〉 and 〈d
y〉 appear not to depend on the electric field.

relationship between the applied gradient, cell diffusivities and drift velocities
to further explore the relationships between d
x, d
y, v
x, v
y and the applied gradient, we calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation for each of the  <dig> histograms in fig.  <dig>  results in fig.  <dig> show 〈v
x〉, 〈v
y〉, 〈d
x〉 and 〈d
y〉, each plotted as a function of the electric field. the plots show the variation in the average transport coefficients with the ef. in addition, the variability in the estimates of the average transport coefficients is indicated by the error bars. the error bars indicate the sample mean plus or minus one sample standard deviation.

y〉 as a function of ef. in each plot the sample mean is shown , and the error bars indicate the variability. in this case the variability is reported as the one sample standard deviation about the mean. in each case an unconstrained linear regression is superimposed in each subfigure




results in fig. 4
a-b show 〈v
x〉 and 〈v
y〉 as a function of the ef. as we anticipate, 〈v
x〉 increases with ef whereas 〈v
y〉≈ <dig> for all ef considered. to examine the putative relationship between 〈v
x〉 and ef, and between 〈v
y〉 and ef, we perform an unconstrained linear regression. the coefficient of determination for the 〈v
x〉 data is very high, r
2= <dig> , suggesting that the linear relationship between 〈v
x〉 and ef provides a good explanation of the variability. in contrast, the coefficient of determination for 〈v
y〉 is very low, r
2= <dig> , suggesting that the null hypothesis is valid and there is no relationship between 〈v
y〉 and ef. in summary, these results imply that a linear relationship between 〈v
x〉 and ef is consistent with the observed data. to match the drift term in eq.  with the advection-diffusion ) we require that v
x=χ∂
s/∂
x. since our data is consistent with a linear relationship between v
x and the applied gradient, ∂
s/∂
x, it appears that a constant tactic sensitivity function, χ=χ, provides the simplest explanation of our experimental results.

results in fig. 4
c-d show 〈d
x〉 and 〈d
y〉 as a function of ef. visually, we see no discernible trend in the data for different values of ef. this visual interpretation is consistent with the fact that we obtain a small coefficient for each of the linear regressions in fig. 4
c-d. therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the cell diffusivities appear to be independent of the electric field. if we accept this assumption and further average the data in fig. 3
i-p in each direction we obtain overall estimates of 〈d
x〉=48μm2/h and 〈d
y〉=46μm2/h. again, this suggests that the diffusion of 3t <dig> fibroblast cells is approximately isotropic since we have d
x≈d
y, across all the experimental conditions considered.

now that we have summarised the estimates of the directed and undirected components of cell migration in the experiments, we can quantify the relative roles in terms of the dimensionless peclet number  <cit> , 
  <dig> pe=vld, 


where v is the drift velocity, d is the diffusivity and l is a relevant length-scale, which here we will take to be the cell diameter of fibroblast cells, l≈25μm  <cit> . the peclet number is a measure of the time scale of advection to the time scale of diffusion  <cit> . when pe≪ <dig>  undirected diffusive transport dominates, when pe≫ <dig>  directed transport dominates, and when pe≈ <dig> to two mechanisms are in balance. comparing estimates of the drift velocity and the diffusivity in the x-direction suggests that our experiments deal with a range of peclet numbers from pe≈ <dig> when ef= <dig> mv/mm to pe≈ <dig> when ef= <dig> mv/mm. therefore, our experimental data covers a wide range of transport conditions ranging from purely undirected, diffusive transport to highly directed, advection-dominant conditions.

to summarise our findings, results in fig.  <dig> suggest that 〈v
x〉 increases linearly with ef, whereas the data suggests that the other transport coefficients, 〈v
y〉, 〈d
x〉 and 〈d
y〉, appear to be independent of ef. guided by these results, we assume that 〈v
x〉 increases linearly with ef, and that the other transport coefficients are independent of ef. comparing the results in fig. 1
c and d also allows us to also consider whether there is any possible relationship between the transport coefficients and the electric potential. repeating the process of plotting our estimates of the four transport coefficients as a function of the electric potential  suggests that there is no obvious trends in the data. furthermore, linear regressions between each transport coefficient and the associated value of the electric potential reveals a low coefficient of determination, r
2< <dig>  therefore, based on the data, we assume that the transport coefficients appear to be independent of the electric potential in these experiments.

discussion
our results indicate that when we quantify the roles of directed and undirected migration of 3t <dig> fibroblast cells under the influence of an applied electric field, the undirected component of the migration appears to be independent of the ef, and the directed migration appears to increase linearly with ef. furthermore, we observe no consistent differences in the cell diffusivity estimates in the x and y cartesian directions, implying that the undirected migration is isotropic. the simplest way to explain these results in terms of a keller-segel-type continuum model ) is that we have a constant diffusivity, d=d, and a constant chemotactic sensitivity function, χ=χ. while the assumption that the chemotactic sensitivity function can be treated as a constant is widely invoked , this assumption is infrequently tested using experimental data collected under a range of gradient conditions. the question of whether the tactic sensitivity function ought to be treated as a constant or a more complicated expression is of interest because many theoretical models incorporate these kinds of details, such as receptor saturation, without necessarily being guided by experimental observations .

CONCLUSIONS
by examining trajectories of 3t <dig> fibroblast cells under a range of physiologically-relevant electric gradients  <cit> , we quantify the roles of directed and undirected migration. in summary we find that the undirected migration is isotropic and the cell diffusivity is approximately  <dig> μm2/h, and that the drift velocity increases approximately linearly with the applied electric field, suggesting that the tactic sensitivity function is a constant.

although our results apply to 3t <dig> fibroblast cells, we anticipate that repeating the experiments and analysis outlined here for different cell lines would provide insight into the roles of directed and undirected motility for any cell line of interest. although we have found that the drift of fibroblasts to increase approximately linearly with the electric field in the range of ef=0− <dig> mv/mm, it is possible that we may observe a different response for different cell lines, or we may observe a different response for the same cell line when we apply a stronger electric field. however, here we deal only with gradients in the range of 0- <dig> mv/mm because this is a physiologically relevant range  <cit> .
