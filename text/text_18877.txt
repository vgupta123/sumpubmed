BACKGROUND
the hemoglobin molecule has evidently been optimized for oxygen binding under vastly different environmental and physiological conditions by the structural and functional divergence of the vertebrate globin chains  <cit> . the tetrameric hemoglobin consists of two α and two β subunits each containing eight alpha helices , and the amino acids are numbered either from the n-terminus  or according to helical positions. whereas the amino acid sequences of both α and β subunits are highly variable with very few invariant positions, adaptive modifications of hemoglobin functions seems to be attributable to a very small number of amino acid substitutions at key positions  <cit> . these genetically based adaptations have evolved under the influence of natural selection and involve adjustments in heme-protein contacts, intersubunit interactions and binding sites for heterotropic ligands  <cit> . the cooperative oxygen binding results from the allosteric equilibrium between the low-affinity t  state and the high-affinity r  state, and the α1β <dig> and α2β <dig> dimeric interfaces undergo the principal changes during the deoxy-to-oxy transition  <cit> . in addition to these sliding contacts, the oxygen binding also involves the α1β <dig> and α2β <dig> subunit contacts, which play a key role in stabilizing the bound oxygen  <cit> . several studies of human hemoglobin mutations have documented that even small changes in these packing contacts may affect hemoglobin stability and oxygen binding affinity  <cit> . further, allosteric effects of chloride ions at the intradimer interfaces cause significant changes in the rates of proton exchange upon ligand binding  <cit> . intriguingly, the leu55β- > ser and pro119α- > ala replacements at the α1β <dig> interface in the bar-headed  and andean geese , respectively, were found to increase the hemoglobin oxygen affinity in these high-altitude species by the elimination of intersubunit contacts  <cit> . correspondingly, replacing met with the smaller val residue in position  <dig> of the polymorphic β <dig> globin of atlantic cod  was predicted to increase the intrinsic oxygen binding affinity as demonstrated in the human met55β- > ser mutant  <cit> .

human hemoglobin mutants have demonstrated the importance of the interaction between arg b <dig> and phe gh <dig> at the α1β <dig> and α2β <dig> interfaces for proper stability and function. replacement of arg with the smaller lys residue containing only two n atoms caused slight anemia in chinese hb kairouan  mutants  <cit> , while normal functional properties was found in the unstable hb prato  mutant  <cit> . corresponding arg b <dig> mutations in the β globin are found in the unstable human hb tacoma , but also in the rat zero β globin  <cit> , while the mutant protein and transcript were undetectable in human hb monroe   <cit> . the importance of the interacting phe gh <dig> was demonstrated by the polar ser replacement in hb caruaru  causing chronic haemolytic anaemia  <cit> , but the stability and oxygen binding affinity of hb bushey  were identical to those of hba  <cit> . phe gh <dig> seems to be highly conserved in the β chains of other tetrapods, but has been replaced by leu and tyr in the αa and αd chains, respectively, of birds and reptiles   <cit> . phe gh <dig> mutations in human α globin include hb foggia  exhibiting a phenotype typical of α thalassemia and was found to impair interactions with both β globin and the alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein   <cit> .

a leu122met polymorphism was recently reported in the atlantic cod β <dig> globin, which also harbors the polymorphic positions met55val and lys62ala that modify the oxygen binding properties of the hbi- <dig> and hbi- <dig> isoforms  <cit> . this marine fish is widely distributed in temperate and arctic waters in the north atlantic, and the hbi- <dig>  and hbi- <dig>  variants dominate in southern and northern populations, respectively  <cit> . it is plausible that the diversification of atlantic cod globin has been driven by positive selection, since these non-synonymous mutations alter hemoglobin function and likely confer an adaptive advantage. in protein coding genes, the ratio  between non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitution rates is related to evolutionary constraints at the protein level  <cit> . a value of ω >  <dig> indicates positive darwinian selection, whereas ω <  <dig> suggests negative selection. to gain insight into the evolutionary history and the functional implications of phe gh <dig> mutations, we 1) searched for amino acid replacements at this position in gnathostome β globins, 2) modeled the structural variants of atlantic cod hemoglobin, 3) examined the distribution of the leu122β1met polymorphism in trans-atlantic cod populations, and 4) investigated genetic signatures of positive selection amongst gadiform β <dig> sequences.

RESULTS
invariant arg31α and novel phe122β mutations
we searched all known hemoglobin sequences from a broad range of gnathostome species for conservation of the interacting residues arg b <dig> and phe gh <dig>  which correspond to positions 31α/30β and 117α/122β, respectively . arg b <dig> was invariantly found in all α globins examined and was also highly conserved in the β globins with a few exceptions. arg was replaced by asn and ser in the pig β-like and in tree shrew β globin, respectively, while gly, cys, asn and lys substitutions were found in the β <dig> and β <dig> globins of scaled reptiles  .

whereas phe gh <dig> has been replaced by leu or tyr in the sauropsid α globins  <cit> , the position has been highly conserved in the β globins with a very few exceptions . we identified a phe- > leu substitution in the β <dig> globin of five marine gadoid species and gilthead seabream , but also the lobe-finned fish comoran coelacanth . further, the freshwater gadiform species burbot  β <dig> globin possessed cys at position gh <dig>  while ile was identified in the large yellow croaker . gadoids possess up to five different β globins  <cit> , but replacements of phe gh <dig> were only found in the β <dig> chain. similarly, the second β globin of gilthead seabream and comoran coelacanth contains the conserved phe gh <dig>  based on the nucleotide sequences available we predicted the sequential point mutations causing the identified phe gh <dig> replacements .

modelled 3d structure of mutated α1β <dig> contacts
computational mutation analysis was performed to examine the structural changes at the α1β <dig> interface in the atlantic cod hemoglobin caused by replacing phe122β  with leu or met, but also with the cys residue identified in burbot. the involvement of the amino acid replacement in the allosteric transition was addressed by generating computational models of both the t- and r-states of the atlantic cod hb <dig> tetramer comprising α1-α1-β1-β <dig>  <cit> . the resulting structures passed all stereochemical and geometric checks in procheck and showed that phe122β forms van der waals contacts across the interface with arg31α, val108α and ile112α in both t- and r- states . both the phe- > leu and phe- > cys substitutions slightly decreased the number of intersubunit contacts in the t-state compared to the r-state, while the phe- > met change did not promote any difference in contacts at the α1β <dig> interface. we therefore predict a mild destabilization of the t-state as a consequence of the leu or cys replacement that might slightly increase the oxygen binding affinity of these variants. in contrast, replacing phe122β with leu in human hba caused no difference in the number of van der waals contacts with arg31α and val107α in the t-and r-state . consistently, the hb-bushey mutant exhibited identical stability and oxygen binding affinity as hba  <cit> .

leu122β1met polymorphism in trans-atlantic cod populations
the distribution of the leu122β1met polymorphism in trans-atlantic populations of atlantic cod was examined by snp genotyping a total of  <dig> adult fish representing  <dig> populations . population pairwise fst values demonstrated a clear genetic separation between northeastern and northwestern cod samples with intermediate icelandic and greenland populations . the met allele dominated in the three canadian populations , and almost 50% of the labrador and newfoundland cod were homozygous for this allele . the allele frequency of met <dig> decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, in the sisimiut and nuuk populations, and only one greenland fish was identified as homozygous met. even lower frequencies of this allele were found in icelandic coastal and frontal populations , northeast arctic cod  population in barents sea , faroe bank and plateau populations  and in spawning neac fish outside lofoten islands , while the met allele was not identified in the north sea, kattegat and baltic sea populations . all samples conformed to hardy-weinberg expectations .

the polymorphic positions met55val and lys62ala of atlantic cod β <dig> globin that discriminate between the hbi- <dig>  and hbi- <dig>  isoforms  <cit>  were included in the genotyping to examine the distribution of the haplotypes. the met <dig> variant was not identified in any hbi- <dig> fish and so exhibited the single haplotype met55-lys62-leu <dig>  while the leu122met polymorphism in the hbi- <dig> fish resulted in the two haplotypes val55-ala62-leu <dig> and val55-ala62–met <dig>  the latter haplotype was rarely found in northeast-atlantic populations, while the val55-lys62-met <dig> recombination was identified in two individuals from labrador and georges bay, and a sisimiut recombinant exhibited the val55-lys62-leu <dig> haplotype.

positive selection
to detect genetic signatures of positive selection acting on the evolution of the β <dig> globin gene in gadiformes, a site-specific likelihood analysis was performed using paml and datamonkey . the one-ratio m <dig> model, which assumes the same ω ratio between non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitutions for all branches, had a log-likelihood value of − <dig>  with ω =  <dig> . the log-likelihood value for the m <dig> model with three discrete site classes was − <dig>  with ω0 =  <dig> , ω1 =  <dig>  and ω2 =  <dig> . comparison of the two models using a likelihood ratio test revealed that model m <dig> provided a significantly better fit to our data set. when compared to a χ <dig> distribution with  <dig> degrees of freedom , the difference in log-likelihood values  of  <dig>  supports the rejection of the one-ratio model m <dig> . similarly, the other two evolution models that allowed for positive selection fitted the data better than those that did not . models m2a, and m <dig> identified positively selected sites at positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  with a ω ratio of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the same codons were identified in model m <dig> with ω =  <dig>  and similar probability values greater than  <dig> . the rel algorithm implemented in datamonkey recognized positively selected sites with a bayes factor greater than  <dig> at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the consensus from all methods indicated that codons  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are under positive selection .

discussion
the vast phylogenetic variation and adaptive modifications of the hemoglobin molecule have fascinated scientists since the pioneering work of braunitzer  <cit>  identifying only eight invariant positions in multiple vertebrate hemoglobins. the post-genomic era has later provided numerous hemoglobin protein and gene sequences from a variety of organisms and even from extinct species to investigate evolutionary conserved positions as well as adaptive changes in specific lineages. here we show that all α globins available from the gnathostomes exhibit the invariant arg b <dig>  which is predominantly coded by the agg codon, whereas the six different arg codons are found in other positions of the α globins in warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates  <cit> . genomic sequences revealed that the arg b <dig> codon spans the exon 1-exon  <dig> boundary of a phase  <dig> intron, and ag↓g is the most frequent signal for exon splicing  <cit> . hence, the functional constraints of the invariant position are accompanied by independent requirements of exon splicing. accordingly, the agg- > acg mutation in human hb monroe  inhibited pre-mrna splicing and no mutant protein and transcript was detected  <cit> . further, the rare aga codon is found in the β-like δ globin gene of primates, and higher primates produce only a small amount of hb a <dig> , while δ globin is a silent gene in old world monkeys  <cit> . this contrasts with the gadoid β <dig> globin, which also has the aga codon, but is highly expressed in the adult atlantic cod at similar levels of β <dig> globin containing the conserved agg codon  <cit> . the additional mutations identified at this position in β globins of pig, tree shrew and scaled reptiles raise the question about the importance of this codon for correct mrna splicing. possible effects of these amino acid replacements on hemoglobin function warrant further studies although the multiple changes identified at subunit contacts and heme contacts in cobra and sea snake hemoglobin appeared compatible with conserved overall functional properties  <cit> . the lizard β <dig> and β <dig> globins are probably products of a lizard-specific duplication event, and the phylogenetic positions of the β paralogs suggest that the common reptile ancestor may have possessed a fairly diverse repertoire of β-like globin genes  <cit> .

the highly conserved arg b <dig> interacts with phe gh <dig>  which has been replaced by leu and tyr, respectively, in the sauropsid αa and αd chains forming the major hba and minor hbd together with a common β chain  <cit> . the higher intrinsic oxygen affinity of avian hbd compared to hba was proposed to involve substitutions at three positions in the α1β <dig> packing contacts, including the leu117α- > tyr change  <cit> . this mutation might represent an evolutionary adaptation to air breathing in reptiles and birds, while the reported leu55β- > ser and pro119α- > ala replacements have further increased the oxygen affinity in high-altitude birds  <cit> . we found phe gh <dig> in the β globins of all sarcopterygians examined, except for the phe- > leu replacement in a “living fossil”; the comoran coelacanth. it should be noted that the phe122β- > leu replacement is also found in the human hb bushey mutant, but the stability and binding affinity were shown to be identical to normal hba  <cit> . on the other hand, multiple heme contacts and positions involved in subunit interface contacts have been replaced in the coelacanth hemoglobin, including the loss of an α1β <dig> contact that might be responsible for the easy dissociation of the tetrameric molecule  <cit> . the coelacanth genome harbors two α and two β globin genes, and the phylogenetic tree grouped the adult β <dig> and embryonic β <dig> globins together with amphibian embryonic β-chains in a clade that was lost in the amniote tetrapods  <cit> . whereas the phe122β- > leu mutation has disappeared in the amniote β globins, the same amino acid change has occurred in the sauropsid αa chain. our site-specific analyses identified six consensus codons under positive selection in gadiform β <dig> globins, and several amino acid substitutions observed at these positively selected sites produce significant changes in charge, size or hydrophobicity, which may affect hemoglobin function. intriguingly, the identified sites under positive selection include positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are polymorphic in atlantic cod; amino acid substitutions at two of these positions in avian hemoglobin seem to offer a selective advantage in air-breathing vertebrates. altogether, the results support the theory of perutz  <cit>  that adaptive changes in hemoglobin functions are caused by a few amino acid substitutions at key positions.

the adaptability of atlantic cod to variable environmental conditions in arctic and temperate north atlantic waters seems to involve several genomic regions containing multiple polymorphic genes  <cit> . the selective advantage of possessing functionally different hemoglobin isoforms has been well documented in atlantic cod, although contradicting results exist  <cit> . the hbi- <dig> and hbi- <dig> allelic variants differ in oxygen binding affinity and temperature sensitivity and are differentially distributed along a temperature gradient in northeast atlantic populations  <cit> . the hbi- <dig> variant predominates in northwest-atlantic waters, but the met122β1leu polymorphism in these populations might further increase the plasticity of this successful species to fluctuating environments. paleoecological modelling and genetic studies of nuclear and mitochondrial markers suggest that cod populations have survived as least for  <dig>  000 years on both sides of the atlantic  <cit> . the leu122β1met polymorphism likely originated in the canadian populations and has expanded in these waters probably over a short historical time and driven by positive selection acting on this codon. consistently, strong temporal shifts were observed in several gene-associated snp loci in canadian populations over an 80-year period indicating ongoing selection over short time-scales  <cit> . the intermediate frequencies of the met <dig> allele in west greenland populations and the rare distribution in icelandic populations are supported by the occasional migration of adult cod from canada to west-greenland waters and the age-specific migration towards east greenland and iceland  <cit> . consistently, postglacial gene flow was suggested by the spatiotemporal snp analysis of trans-atlantic cod populations demonstrating that samples from west greenland offshore showed the greatest genetic affinity to canada  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the importance of the α1β <dig> and α2β <dig> subunit contacts for hemoglobin stability and oxygen binding affinity is strongly supported by the conservation of the interacting residues arg b <dig> and phe gh <dig> in the gnathostomes. on the other hand, amino acid replacements identified at these positions in β globins of scaled reptiles and gadiform fishes might offer a selective advantage under certain conditions as indicated by the modeled interactions and genetic signatures of positive selection in the latter group. intriguingly, the intradimer contacts b12-gh <dig> and h2-d <dig> are both polymorphic in atlantic cod, while amino acid replacements at these positions in avian hemoglobin seem to be beneficial for air-breathing.
