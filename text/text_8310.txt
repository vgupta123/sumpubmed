BACKGROUND
molecular profiling of clinical tissue specimens is frequently complicated by their cellular heterogeneity. laser capture microdissection  has successfully been used to tackle this problem by isolating pure cell populations from tissue sections  <cit>  and the combination of lcm with standard genomic and proteomic methods has revolutionized molecular analysis of complex tissue. it has allowed for the discrimination of genomic changes, differential expressions and subsequent signaling effects for a variety of proteins in diagnostic tissues  <cit> . despite these advances, the quantity and quality of material recovered after lcm is often still limited for analysis by using whole genomic and proteomic approaches  <cit> .

micrornas  play important regulatory roles in various cellular pathways including development, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . demonstrated abnormal expression patterns of mirnas in human disease tissues highlight their potential use as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, especially in the case of cancer  <cit> . in fact, mirnas have already been demonstrated to function as both tumor suppressors and oncogenes  <cit> . furthermore, mirnas have advantages over mrnas as cancer biomarkers, since they are very stable in vitro  <cit>  and long-lived in vivo  <cit> . so far, the large majority of published mirna expression studies utilized whole tumor tissues without separating the truly transformed cancerous cells from those other cell types commonly present within a tumor . analysis of such complex tissues could conceal the specific signature of the particular cell type of interest. a potentially powerful method to develop diagnostic tests would be to correlate cell type-specific mirna profiles with pathologic and clinical outcomes.

combination of lcm and whole genome analysis is an ideal method for cell type-specific expression profiling in complex tissue, however, such a combination has not been widely applied to discover mirna biomarkers in solid tumors. to explore the possibility of using lcm for genome-wide mirna analysis, we optimized the procedures on tissue preparation and then compared the mirna expression profiles of  <dig> colorectal tissues in lcm selected epithelial cells and stromal cells using agilent mirna microarrays. we then applied quantitative rt-pcr to cross-verify the expression patterns of  <dig> different mirnas using  <dig> lcm-selected epithelial cells. in this study, we demonstrate a significant improvement in rna quality and quantity by prolonged ethanol fixation of tissue sections. we further present  <dig> significantly differentially expressed mirnas between the epithelial and stromal cells from colorectal tissues. we then show that the mirnas in the epithelial cells could differentiate adenomas from normal and carcinomas, however, the mirnas in the stromal and mixed cells could not separate adenomas from normal tissues. we finally illustrate the correlation of the fold changes between the microarray and quantitative rt-pcr. to our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility and potential power of using a combination of lcm with genome-wide mirna analysis on discovering cell type-specific mirna biomarkers in complex tissue.

RESULTS
effect of ethanol fixation on rna quality and quantity
to assess the effect of ethanol fixation on rna quality and quantity, we immediately fixed fresh tissue sections with 100% ethanol for  <dig> minutes, and then stored the slides at -80°c for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. the experimental conditions and their corresponding rin scores are shown in table  <dig>  rna quality and quantity of these sections in presence and absence of ethanol fixation are displayed in figure  <dig>  overall, the ethanol fixation significantly improved rna quality  and quantity . the maximum improvement of the quality  and quantity  were observed in storing the sections with 100% ethanol at -80°c for  <dig> hours .

effect of rnase inhibitor on rna quality and quantity
besides the fixation, we evaluated the effect of rnase inhibitor treatment on the tissue preparation. rna quality and quantity of the tissue sections in presence and absence of an rnase inhibitor are shown in additional file  <dig>  the presence of the rnase inhibitor reduced both rna quality and quantity of one sample , whilst slightly improved the rna quantity in two samples . essentially, there was no considerable improvement in both quality and quantity of rna recovered from the tissue sections with the inhibitor treatment.

effect of lcm on rna quality
using the improved protocol for tissue preparation, we first determined rna quality in the hematoxylin-stained sections with and without lcm. all the samples were subjected to the same fixation and staining processes but the only difference was the use of microdissection. the rin score was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for the sections without lcm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for the sections with lcm . compared to the sections without lcm, the rin score was decreased by 30% during the microdissection . we then examined the consistency of rna quality for the lcm selected epithelial cells derived from  <dig> colorectal tissues . on average, the rin score was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for normal,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for adenoma and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for carcinoma tissues .

reliability of lcm and mirna analysis
replicate experiments were performed to determine the reliability of combining lcm with genome-wide mirna analysis. the epithelial cells were microdissected on  <dig> individual colorectal tissues including  <dig> normal,  <dig> tubular adenomas and  <dig> dukes' c carcinomas. we performed array hybridizations on these epithelial cells and determined the correlation amongst individual samples derived from the same tissue type . the average correlation  of epithelial cells isolated from normal tissues, tubular adenomas and dukes' c carcinomas was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. to determine the variability of the lcm protocol, we performed triplicate lcm experiments on the same tumor tissue and hybridized the lcm-selected epithelial cells on three individual microarrays. as shown in figure 3d, the correlation  amongst the triplicate experiments was  <dig> .

cell type-specific mirna expression profiles
using agilent mirna microarrays containing  <dig> human mirna probe sets, we profiled the mirna expression of  <dig> colorectal tissues in lcm selected epithelial and stromal cells. significance analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> mirnas as differentially expressed between the epithelial and stromal cell types . figure 4a illustrates an unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these differentially expressed mirnas and shows that the clustering placed 18/ <dig> epithelial cells in one group and 18/ <dig> stromal cells in another group. expression levels of  <dig> human mirnas in the epithelial and stromal cells of colorectal tissues are given in additional file  <dig> 

we then assessed the mirna expression profiles of the colorectal tumors in the epithelial cells and identified  <dig> mirnas that could differentiate adenomas from normal and carcinoma tissues . we further evaluated the mirna profiles of the colorectal tumors in the stromal cells and identified  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas that separated normal-adenomas into one group and carcinomas into another group . we finally examined the mirna profiles of the colorectal tumors in the mixed cell types  and identified  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas amongst normal, adenoma and carcinoma tissues . the similar cases were observed in both stromal and mixed cell types where the mirnas could not separate adenomas from normal tissues.

we compared the expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas in colorectal tumors with data previously published  <cit> . schetter et al. used whole colorectal tissues while our study used lcm selected epithelial cells. using the whole colorectal tissues, significant fold changes were identified in only one mirna for adenomas and  <dig> mirnas for carcinomas, while considerable changes were seen in  <dig> mirnas for adenomas and  <dig> mirnas for carcinomas when we used the pure epithelial cells . the overall fold-changes obtained on the whole colorectal tissues were considerably lower than those determined using the pure epithelial cells.

across-platform comparison
to examine consistency with other platform, data from quantitative rt-pcr were generated on  <dig> mirnas using  <dig> lcm-selected epithelial cells derived from  <dig> pairs of colorectal tumor tissues. the correlation  of fold changes between agilent mirna microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr was  <dig> . the expression patterns of the mirnas for  <dig> pairs of the colorectal tumors are shown in figure  <dig>  the results demonstrate that the mirna signatures discovered using agilent mirna microarrays are highly reliable.

discussion
combination of lcm with genome-wide mirna analysis has not been widely applied to discover mirna biomarkers in solid tumors. this is due to the facts that the tiny amounts of mirna present in the cells  and rna recovered from lcm is typically very poor in both quality and quantity using conventional lcm procedures  <cit> . rna degradation is primarily due to endogenous rnases that are activated in an aqueous environment. based on this observation, we tested ethanol fixation and rnase inhibitor treatment on tissue preparations to procure high-quality yields of rna. we used ethanol fixation to minimize the tissue sections for exposure to water, whereas rnase inhibitor treatment was used to inhibit the reactivation of endogenous rnases during the staining process.

we found that ethanol fixation of tissue sections is the preferred procedure for ensuring the highest quality and yield of rna from lcm. to maximize the balance between tissue morphology and rna quality, the sections on the slides should be immediately fixed with 100% ethanol at -25°c in the cryostat for  <dig> minutes, and then stored at -80°c for  <dig> hours. this ethanol fixation procedure produced a  <dig> -fold improvement in rna quality and a  <dig> -fold increase in rna quantity compared to the sections without the fixation. in agreement with previous reports discussing lcm protocols  <cit> , the sections should not be dried on the slide at room temperature. all reagents for fixation, staining and dehydration should be cooled to 4°c. the staining should be carried out on ice.

the efficacy of rnase inhibitor treatment on tissue sections during the staining process is uncertain. kube et al. reported that rnase inhibitors could significantly improve rna quality  <cit> , however, we did not observe considerable improvement on either rna quality or quantity in the sections treated with rnase inhibitor. in agreement with our observation, a recent study revealed no difference in the quantity and quality of rna recovered from microdissected colon cancer samples with and without rnase inhibitor treatment  <cit> .

it has been shown that rna can be damaged by heat, uv light, chemical components of histological staining and enzymatic degradation. therefore, lcm itself can affect the quality of total rna. on the other hand, the procedure of tissue dissection will destroy the integrity of cells especially in an aqueous environment, meanwhile, endogenous rnases will be released and have much chances to connect with rna. in our study, applying lcm lowered 30% of the rin values demonstrates that lcm can introduce rna damage during its procedure. it is crucial to thoroughly air-dry the slides before placing them into the lcm instrument for preserving rna degradation.

we could not directly compare rna quantity in the tissue sections with and without lcm. using our improved protocol for tissue preparation, the yield of total rna from ~ <dig> ×  <dig> lcm selected epithelial cells was between  <dig> and  <dig> ng. the time required to select and capture such an amount of relevant cells is usually 1- <dig> hours when isolating cells located in a complex tissue. the order of rna quality after lcm is carcinoma  > adenoma  > normal tissue . this could be due to the fact that rnase activity in the carcinoma tissue is lower than that in the normal tissue  <cit> .

recently, ibberson et al. reported that rna degradation compromised the reliability of mirna expression profiling and stated that total rna degradation with rin values less than  <dig> should not be used for analysis of individual mirnas  <cit> . in our study, we used a mirvana mirna isolation kit to prepare total rna for the mirna analysis. the rna isolation procedure combining the advantages of organic extraction and solid-phase extraction can effectively recover small rnas. the rna quality recovered from our lcm and isolation procedures is 37% with rin ≥  <dig>  39% with rin ≥  <dig> and 24% with rin <  <dig>  to minimize experimental variations, we chose to use agilent mirna microarray, since the platform features the direct end-labeling and profiling of mature mirnas from total rna without any size fractionation or amplification. obviously, the different rna isolation methods and microarray platforms used in the studies can affect the rna quality and thus the mirna profiles. the tissues shall be procured immediately after surgery, cut into small pieces , embedded in oct compound, fast-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°c. using such frozen tissue processing, the rna quality of our frozen tissues is 79% with rin ≥  <dig> and 21% with rin ≥  <dig>  methods upstream of rna isolation are crucial for preserving rna integrity.

we determined the correlation of lcm selected epithelial cells derived from the same tissue type and variability of the triplicate lcm experiments using the microarray platform. we show that the correlation of the individual samples from the same tissue type is between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while the correlation amongst the triplicate lcm experiments is  <dig> . we further applied quantitative rt-pcr to cross-verify the expression patterns of  <dig> different mirnas using  <dig> lcm selected epithelial cells. the correlation of the fold changes between agilent mirna microarray and quantitative rt-pcr are excellent . the highly reproducible data demonstrate that rna quality with rin value ≥  <dig> obtained from our lcm and rna isolation procedures is generally sufficient for genome-wide mirna analysis.

high-throughput microarrays have significantly enhanced our knowledge of cancer biology  <cit> . the accuracy of microarray data, however, is determined by the specificity of the input rna. we can imagine difficulties arising during microarray analysis of tissue when there are varying levels of tumor cells versus normal and stromal cells. for example, a tissue comprised of 60% tumor, 30% normal and 10% stromal cells, would have non-cancer cell types contributing to more than 40% of the overall signal. since the amount of non-cancer tissue in colorectal tumors is highly variable , taking a "whole tissue" approach to microarrays may yield great variations in the results, as compared to those attainable using lcm selection of only epithelial cancer cells. in our study on  <dig> colorectal tissues, we found that the mirnas in the epithelial cells could differentiate three categories of colorectal tissues , however, the mirnas in both stromal and mixed cell types could not separate adenomas from normal tissues. when we compared the expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas from the report of schetter et al.  <cit>  with those collected in our study, we found that the overall fold-changes obtained on the whole tissues were considerably lower than those determined by using the pure epithelial cells, especially in the case of adenomas. for carcinomas, we observed the significant concordance of the regulation trends between the two studies, although the total rna source and microarray platforms used for both experiments were not identical. for adenomas, we found the considerable differences of the fold changes between the whole colorectal tissues and lcm-selected epithelial cells. such differences observed in both studies are mainly due to the varying levels of the tumor cells in the whole tumor tissues. in some cases, the tumor cells may be less than 10%. it is clear that the expression levels of the whole tumor tissue cannot only represent the signals from the tumor cells, but also from the normal epithelial cells and other cell types of interstitial tissue. this demonstrates the potential power of discovering mirna biomarkers in a complex tissue using the combination of lcm with genome-wide mirna analysis.

most cancers are epithelial in origin and arise through a stepwise progression from normal cells, through dysplasic cells, into malignant cells  <cit> . focusing research on cell-specific molecular biomarkers can help in the development of novel concepts for diagnosis and treatment of epithelial cancers. in our study, we discovered  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in the pure epithelial and stromal cells. the mirnas that are specifically expressed in the epithelial cells hold potential utility in the further discovery of cell-specific mirna biomarkers for epithelial cancers. other mirnas that are highly expressed in the stromal cells might have values in the establishment of their roles on immune function and relate to cancer progression and recurrence in solid tumors  <cit> . our small study presents a good example using the microdissection for elucidation of mirna biomarkers in specific cell populations. additional confirmatory studies, however, are required to establish the full significance of our findings.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show good quality and quantity of rna recovered from lcm using our improved procedures on tissue preparation. by comparing the mirna expression profiles of colorectal tissues in the mixed cell types with the pure epithelial cells, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential power of discovering mirna biomarkers in complex tissue using the combination of lcm with genome-wide mirna analysis. additionally, we discovered  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in epithelial and stromal cells. such cell type-specific mirnas have great potentials in the development of novel approaches for diagnosis and treatment of epithelial cancers. we expect that our optimized ethanol-fixation protocol will serve as a basic tool for molecular analysis of frozen tissues. the protocol is simple and shall be easy to implement in a standard biology laboratory.
