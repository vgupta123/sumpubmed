BACKGROUND
bacteriophage therapy is one of the emerging methods used to overcome bacterial infections  <cit> . bacteriophages are viruses that infect and kill bacteria. theoretically, phages have several advantages over antibiotics. they are highly specific and very effectively lyse targeted pathogenic bacteria. they are safe because they have no activity against animal or plant cells. phages are ubiquitous, so isolation of new phages is a relatively rapid process that can frequently be accomplished in days or weeks. the use of phages as therapeutic agents was initiated in  <dig>  3 years after their discovery, for the treatment of bacillary dysentery and continued until the 1940s. over this time period, phages were used to treat a variety of infectious diseases  <cit> . however, with the advent of antibiotics, commercial production of therapeutic phages ceased in most of the western world  <cit> . currently, there is renewed interest in phage research and the applications of bacteriophages as potentially powerful antibacterial agents due to the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens and the dearth of new antibiotics. several studies have shown that bacteriophages can be used successfully for therapeutic purposes, both in humans and animals  <cit> . however, more research is required before clinical use can be re-initiated. before using a phage for therapeutic purposes, the isolation of lytic phages and characterization of the phage are essential.

in this study, clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii were collected and used as indicator hosts to screen phages from water samples. a. baumannii mostly infects debilitated patients in intensive care units and is associated with high mortality rates  <cit> . since its discovery, a. baumannii has become resistant to many common antibiotics  <cit> . the increasing prevalence of multidrug- and pandrug-resistant a. baumannii strains in clinics has rendered it one of the most important nosocomial pathogens  <cit> . fortunately, lytic phages specific to a. baumannii might provide an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of infections caused by this bacterium. however, to the best of our knowledge, very few detailed characterizations of a. baumannii phages have been published  <cit> . this paper describes the isolation and characterization of a novel virulent phage, zz <dig>  that infects a. baumannii clinical isolates.

RESULTS
isolation of zz <dig> and its morphology
twenty-three a. baumannii clinical isolates were screened for phage present in a sample of fishpond water. among these, only the strain ab09v could serve as an indicator for zz <dig> in the initial screening. this phage formed clear plaques of approximately 1-2 mm in diameter on ab09v lawns. ab09v was thus used to propagate, purify and characterize the phage. as shown in figure  <dig>  the phage zz <dig> has a 100-nm icosahedral head and a 120-nm long contractile tail. morphologically, phage zz <dig> can be tentatively classified as a member of the myoviridae family in the order of caudovirales. most of the input phages rapidly adsorbed to ab09v cells. appearance of ghost particles 5 min after mixing phages with bacteria suggested that ejection of dna from the phage head occurred rapidly.

host range of zz <dig> and identification of bacterial strains
two additional natural bacterial hosts, ab <dig> and ab <dig>  were found when the other  <dig> of the  <dig> a. baumannii clinical isolates were used to investigate the host range of zz <dig> by spot test. this test used a higher concentration of phage  than the original screen. interestingly, some differences were observed in the ability of the phage to lyse the  <dig> bacterial hosts . for example, as shown figure  <dig>  zz <dig> was capable of forming transparent areas on lawns of the strains ab09v, ab <dig>  and ab <dig>  however, the minimum phage concentrations required to form clear spots on each lawn were different: ab09v required  <dig> pfu/ml, ab <dig> required  <dig> pfu/ml, and ab <dig> required  <dig> pfu/ml. the values suggest that under the same culture conditions, the antibacterial activity of zz <dig> was highest in strain ab09v, followed by ab <dig> and then ab <dig>  there might be natural resistance mechanisms in ab <dig> and ab0902; thus, the strain ab09v is likely the most sensitive indicator of the phage titer of the  <dig> strains and is the best host for phage propagation.

the  <dig> strains that can be infected by zz <dig> were selected for further detailed study. they were resistant to all of the antibiotics tested except polymyxin . partial 16 s rrna genes of the  <dig> strains were sequenced and deposited in genbank under the accession numbers  ,  , and  . nucleotide blast analysis further confirmed that the three strains were a. baumannii.

stability investigation
temperature and ph stability are two important parameters in the storage of therapeutic phage. thus, the stability of zz <dig> was investigated at different phs and temperatures. as shown in figure  <dig>  no obvious effect on zz <dig> activity was observed after 1 h of incubation at ph levels ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  however, the phage completely lost its infectivity at ph  <dig> or higher and ph  <dig> or lower. within 1 h of incubation at ph  <dig>  the phage infectivity decreased by approximately 87%, and a titer of  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml of active phage zz <dig> was detected at the end of the incubation. the maximum stability of the phage was observed at a ph between  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, the results of thermal stability tests shown in figure  <dig> suggest that zz <dig> was relatively heat stable over 1 h at temperatures between 50°c and 60°c, and no significant loss in phage activity was observed. at 70°c, the phage titer quickly dropped, and no viral particles were detected after 40 min. furthermore, phage activity was completely lost at 80°c within the first 1 min of incubation. the zz <dig> phage lysate retained almost 100% of its infection activity when stored at both 25°c and 4°c for several months .

investigation of antimicrobial activity of zz <dig> against ab09v at different temperatures
optimal a. baumannii growth occurs over a very broad temperature range  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the ab09v lawns grew well on nutrient agar plates at temperatures ranging from 25°c to 42°c. however, the antimicrobial activity of zz <dig> is clearly influenced by temperature variations. when the plates were incubated at different temperatures, the minimum phage concentrations required to form clear spots on ab09v lawns were different:  <dig> pfu/ml at 35°c, 37°c, and 39°c;  <dig> pfu/ml at 30°c and 40°c;  <dig> pfu/ml at 25°c; and  <dig> pfu/ml at 42°c. thus, we concluded that zz <dig> exhibits the most efficient antibacterial activity against the ab09v strain at temperatures ranging from 35°c to 39°c, which suggested that zz <dig> could exhibit powerful antibacterial activity against ab09v at body temperature.

phage growth attributes on ab09v
the growth characteristics of zz <dig> on the sensitive indicator strain ab09v were characterized under optimal growth conditions. phage zz <dig> exhibited high infection efficiency after mixing the phages and ab09v cells. we inferred that almost all of the a. baumannii ab09v were infected prior to the burst time of the first infected cell because the number of bacteria surviving at 9 min was less than 100 cfu/ml. moreover, as shown in figure  <dig>  the total plaque count was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml at the beginning of infection , and only  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml remained after 9 min. the difference  originated from adsorption of multiple phage particles to one susceptible bacterial cell. the decrease in the number of phages was greater than 6-fold higher than the initial number of bacterial cells . these results further confirmed that almost all of the bacterial cells could be infected within the latent period . the number of unattached phages at the end of the latent period  can be estimated as the difference between the number of the total plaque count and the initial number of bacterial cells. the calculated number of unattached phages was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml, which is negligible compared to the phage number at the end of the experiment . moreover, the number of bacteria surviving at the end of the experiment is less than 50 cfu/ml, which can also be considered negligible when compared to the initial number of bacterial cells . therefore, the average burst size was approximately  <dig> pfu/cell, which can be calculated as the ratio of the final count of phage particles to the initial count of infected bacterial cells.

genome analysis
the phage nucleic acid was susceptible to degradation by dnase and some restriction endonucleases  but unaffected by rnase. thus, zz <dig> is a dsdna phage . the zz <dig> genome has a total length of  <dig>  bp and a gc content of  <dig> %, which is slightly lower than that described for the a. baumannii atcc  <dig> strain . an initial ncbi nucleotide blast analysis  of the complete genome sequence indicated that zz <dig> shares limited similarities with other known phage nucleotide sequences, which confirmed its status as a novel acinetobacter phage species. the top  <dig> most similar sequences found were of the acinetobacter phages acj <dig> , acj <dig> , ac <dig> , and  <dig> . the max scores were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the four acinetobacter phages were recently deposited in genbank and were previously annotated as t4-like phages  <cit> . no other acinetobacter phages were hit by blastn. in addition, enterobacteria phage t <dig> ranked tenth, and its max score was  <dig> , suggesting that the zz <dig> phage might be a new member of the t4-like phage family.

a sequence search using the ncbi open reading frame  finder revealed a total of  <dig> putative orfs of  <dig> or more codons in the zz <dig> genome that have limited similarity to other known phage proteins. among them,  <dig> orfs have the highest similarity to predicted orfs from the acinetobacter phage acj9;  <dig> orfs are most similar to predicted orfs from the acinetobacter phage acj61;  <dig> orfs most closely resemble predicted orfs from the acinetobacter phage 133; and only  <dig> orfs have the highest score with predicted orfs from the acinetobacter phage ac <dig>  in addition, of the  <dig> orfs,  <dig> orfs showed homology with sequences in genbank with annotated function;  <dig> orfs had matches with uncharacterized entries; and the remaining  <dig> orfs had no match to sequenced genes in the database.

discussion
phage therapy has been the subject of several recent reviews, and the present study reinforces the view that it is worth exploring  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, the characterization of lytic phages of a. baumannii has rarely been studied, although ackermann et al.  <cit>  described the classification of an a. baumannii phage, and soothill et al.  <cit>  tested the efficacy of phage therapy for experimental a. baumannii infections in mice. in this study, we focused our efforts on the isolation and characterization of a. baumannii phages with potential for prophylactic/therapeutic use.

phages are thought to be found wherever bacteria thrive  <cit> . acinetobacter spp. are ubiquitous organisms that can be readily isolated from non-clinical sources, such as soil, drinking and surface waters, sewage, and a variety of different foods  <cit> , which suggests that phages specific to a. baumannii might also be easily isolated from nature. recently,  <dig> phages were obtained from wastewater using  <dig> clinical isolates of a. baumannii as indicator hosts  <cit> . these phages were designated ab <dig> to ab <dig> and ab <dig>  examination by transmission electron microscopy suggested that phages ab1- <dig> and ab <dig> belonged to the podoviridae family, and phages ab <dig> and ab <dig> belonged to the myoviridae family. two of the  <dig> phages, ab <dig> and ab <dig>  were further characterized at 35°c and 37°c, respectively. based on morphology and genomic analysis, the two phages were classified as new members of the ϕkmv-like phages  <cit> . in this study, the phage zz <dig>  which is specific to a. baumannii, was isolated from fishpond water, which further confirmed that phages specific to a. baumannii are waiting to be exploited as an abundant natural resource. the ability of phage zz <dig> to form clear plaques on lawns of ab09v is indicative of lytic phage, and a large burst size with a short latent period is further suggestive of the lytic nature of phage zz <dig>  morphologically, zz <dig> exhibits features similar to the myoviridae family , which, broadly, are tailed phages with icosahedral head symmetry and contractile tail structures. genome analysis of zz <dig> showed that it is fairly similar to four other acinetobacter phages . in a recent review by petrov et al.  <cit> , the four acinetobacter phages were initially assigned to the “t4-like viruses” genus. each of these acinetobacter phages has a unique set of orfs that occupy ~35% of the genome. that is, each represents a different type of t4-related phage genome  <cit> . the genome size of the phage zz <dig>  is also close to the genome size of t4-like phages. these genomes vary between ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  bp  <cit> . therefore, the above features confirmed that the phage zz <dig> is most likely a new member of the t4-like virus family of acinetobacter phages. however, according to the  <dig> virus taxonomy list  from the international committee for the taxonomy of viruses , only the acinetobacter phage  <dig> can be searched and classified in the unassigned genus of the myoviridae family, most likely because the phage is inadequately characterized. at the very least, the current sequence database for the myoviridae phages should prove to be a rich source of genetic markers for bioprospecting and a mine of reagents for basic research and biotechnology. our future research will focus on further detailed analysis of the whole zz <dig> genome to understand the genetic characteristics of this phage.

the main aim of this study was the isolation and characterization of a lytic bacteriophage with potential for prophylactic/therapeutic use. therefore, the antibacterial activity of the phage against its different host cells was the focus of our research. through the preliminary in vitro host range investigation, zz <dig> was found to have different antibacterial activity against  <dig> of its natural hosts. the antibacterial activity of zz <dig> was highest against the strain ab09v, followed by ab <dig> and then ab <dig>  based on the minimum phage concentration required to form clear spots at 37°c. the natural resistance mechanisms of ab <dig> and ab <dig> against zz <dig> are worth further investigation in future studies. with respect to its life cycle in the sensitive strain ab09v, zz <dig> proliferates efficiently, with a short latent period , a large burst size , and a high adsorption rate. remarkably, only less than 50 cfu/ml of the ab09v cells remained viable 30 min after ab09v cells were mixed with zz <dig> particles at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> at 37 °c. moreover, zz <dig> exhibited the most powerful antibacterial activity at temperatures ranging from 35°c to 39°c, suggesting that the phage would be highly effective when placed inside the body at normal or near normal body temperature. in addition, zz <dig> was stable over a wide ph range  and was strongly resistant to heat. all of these features have implications for the use of this phage as a stable therapeutic agent for the treatment of a. baumannii infections, especially those caused by the strain most sensitive to the phage, ab09v. the differences in the antibacterial activity of zz <dig> against the strains tested will be the focus of our future research both in vitro and in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides information about a novel virulent a. baumannii phage. our future research will examine the application of this characterized phage in treating infections by a. baumannii clinical isolates both in vivo and in vitro.
