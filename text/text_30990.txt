BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is one of the major health problems in mozambique. it is estimated that  <dig>  deaths caused by tb occur each year with an estimated incidence and prevalence rate of  <dig> and  <dig> per  <dig>  population, respectively <cit> . mozambique ranks 19th on the list of  <dig> tb high-burden countries in the world. a steady increase in the prevalence rate of human immunodeficiency virus /acquired immune deficiency syndrome   makes the situation even more precarious. mozambique, with around  <dig> million inhabitants, shares geographical borders with six other countries where tb is also endemic, i.e., south africa, swaziland, zimbabwe, zambia, malawi and tanzania.

at present mozambique has  <dig> district laboratories performing smear microscopy for tb diagnosis and one national reference laboratory that performs culture and drug susceptibility testing of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex  isolates.

molecular genotyping is an important tool for the understanding of tb epidemiology. despite the high tb burden in the sub-saharan africa region, there is currently a paucity of information regarding the genetic diversity of mtc strains in mozambique and no published data is available.

various methods have been used for phylogenetic and population genetic studies  <cit> . spoligotyping is a polymerase chain reaction -based genotyping method that permits the assessment of the mtc genetic biodiversity in a rapid, reliable and cost effective way  <cit> . on the basis of the variability of the direct-repeat locus  <cit> , spoligotyping has been used worldwide to type large numbers of strains in population based studies.

in the present study, we characterized by spoligotyping  <dig> mtc isolates from a drug resistance surveillance study performed in mozambique over a 1-year period , in order to identify the predominant spoligotypes responsible for the prevalence of tb in mozambique.

RESULTS
patients
the study included a total of  <dig> m. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients in mozambique recruited during a resistance surveillance study over a 1-year period . the preliminary results of the drug resistance surveillance study provided by the national tuberculosis control program indicate that  <dig> % of all new cases analysed in their sample presented any resistance and  <dig> % were multi-drug resistant  <cit> . of the isolates included in the present study,  <dig> were from the south region of the country and  <dig> were from the north .

the demographic information of the patients showed that  <dig>  were male while  <dig>  were female. the patients' median age was  <dig> years  with a range of 15- <dig> years. stratification according to age showed that  <dig>  of the patients were aged 15- <dig>   <dig>  were 35- <dig> years while  <dig>  were 55+. in  <dig>  cases, information about age was not available.

of all the patients,  <dig>  were hiv positive,  <dig>  hiv negative and  <dig>  were not tested for hiv. the majority of the hiv positive patients were from the south 89/ <dig> , while 9/ <dig>  were from the north. the age distribution among patients that were tested for hiv and the ones that were not tested were similar, patient's median age were  <dig>  and  <dig>  years  respectively.

spoligotyping
spoligotyping produced a total of  <dig> different patterns for the  <dig> strains studied. forty-nine patterns corresponded to orphan strains that were unique among more than  <dig>  strains recorded in the sitvit <dig> database , as opposed to  <dig> patterns from  <dig> patients that corresponded to shared-types , i.e. an identical pattern shared by two or more patients worldwide , as shown in additional file  <dig>  the genotypic clade designations, the percentage distribution of all sits observed in this study; for each of the sit shown, their binary/octal description, the number of total strains and percentage in the present study as compared to the same in the sitvit <dig> database are summarized in additional file  <dig>  phylogenetic lineage description for each sit was also provided. for the  <dig> sits recorded a total of  <dig> sits  matched a pre-existing sit in the sitvit <dig> database, whereas  <dig> sits  were newly-created either within the present study or after a match with an orphan in the database. irrespective of the database comparison,  <dig> patterns corresponded to clusters in the present study ;  <dig> clusters containing  <dig> isolates , amounting to an overall clustering rate of  <dig> % .

when the spoligotyping results and clade definitions were linked to the distribution of clinical isolates within principal genetic group   <dig> versus pgg2/ <dig> , it was evident that  <dig> or  <dig> % of the isolates belonged to pgg <dig>  as compared to  <dig> or  <dig> % to the pgg2/ <dig>  .

if one takes the sample of clinical isolates with newly created sits in the database and orphans as an indication of newly documented diversity of tubercle bacilli, a total of 39/ <dig> or  <dig> % pgg <dig> strains were newly documented as opposed to 38/ <dig> or  <dig> % pgg2/ <dig> strains.

as illustrated in fig  <dig>  the  <dig> most predominant lineages comprised both pgg <dig> and pgg2/ <dig> lineages: latin-american mediterranean , n =  <dig> or  <dig> % ; ancestral east african-indian , n =  <dig> or  <dig> % ; an evolutionary recent but yet ill-defined t clade, n =  <dig> or  <dig> % ; and the globally-emerging beijing clone, n =  <dig> or 7% . the rest of the lineages were in the following order: haarlem , n =  <dig> or  <dig> % ; x clade, n =  <dig> or  <dig> % ; central asian , n =  <dig> or  <dig> % . moreover, we found  <dig> isolates with manu patterns  or  <dig> % , that were further investigated for region of difference   <dig> polymorphism.

a high spoligotype diversity was documented for eai, lam and t lineages . indeed, out of the  <dig> sublineages reported so far worldwide for the lam clade  <cit> , a total of  <dig> sublineages were present in our  <dig> year recruitment. a high diversity was also evidenced for other pgg <dig> clades , as well as pgg2/ <dig> clades .

furthermore, no m. africanum or m. bovis were found in this study.

we also attempted to describe the worldwide distribution of predominant sits  encountered in this study. as shown in table  <dig>  we observed that many of the predominant sits in our study belonging both to ancient pgg <dig> strains  and evolutionary recent pgg2/ <dig> strains  were more frequently present in eastern and southern africa . furthermore,  <dig> lineages or sublineages in table  <dig> were made-up of their prototypes in the sitvit <dig> database; these concerned sit <dig> for lam <dig>  sit <dig> for lam <dig>  sit <dig> for lam <dig>  sit <dig> for eai1-som, sit <dig> for t <dig>  sit <dig> for lam11-zwe, and sit <dig> for x <dig> sublineages.

* worldwide distribution is reported for regions with ≥5% of a given sits as compared to their total number in the sitvit <dig> database. the definition of macro-geographical regions and sub-regions http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm is according to the united nations; regions: afri , amer , asia , euro , and oce , subdivided in: e , m , c , n , s , se , and w . furthermore, carib  belongs to americas, while oceania is subdivided in  <dig> sub-regions, aust , mel , mic , and poly . note that in our classification scheme, russia has been attributed a new sub-region by itself  instead of including it among rest of the eastern europe. it reflects its geographical localization as well as due to the similarity of specific tb genotypes circulating in russia  with those prevalent in central, eastern and south-eastern asia.

** the  <dig> letter country codes are according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-1_alpha-3; countrywide distribution is only shown for sits with ≥5% of a given sits as compared to their total number in the sitvit <dig> database.

geographical distribution of spoligotypes
m. tuberculosis genotype distribution of the predominant lineages from the south and north regions of mozambique is illustrated in fig  <dig>  a comparison of spoligotype distribution among the two regions indicates that the lam, eai and t lineages were common across the country, while the beijing lineage was found to be more common in the south 27/ <dig>  compared to the north 4/ <dig> .

rd <dig> analysis of manu pattern isolates
since the manu <dig> pattern  may eventually correspond to a mixed pattern due to concomitant beijing and euro-american lineage strains , we further investigated the five manu pattern isolates for the presence of rd <dig>  in one of the manu <dig> pattern samples  we observed a  <dig> banded rd <dig> pattern, yielding an intact pcr product  as well as a deleted product , indicating a mixed infection. the second manu <dig> pattern sample  showed only one band, with the rd  <dig> deletion, indicating that the original culture contained a mix of two strains  which on subculture and subsequent rd analysis had retained only the beijing strain. the third manu <dig> pattern sample  yielded a one band pattern with an intact rd <dig> product. we therefore conclude that two manu <dig> patterns may be attributed to mixed infections by beijing , and t <dig> sublineage strain , or due to simultaneous presence of beijing and t <dig>  or t2_uganda sublineages . on the other hand, the third manu <dig> pattern  represents a true manu <dig> strain.

in the two samples with manu <dig> pattern we did observe the presence of the genomic region rd <dig> 

discussion
this study represents the first report on the genetic diversity of circulating mtc strains in mozambique. we found that tb lineages frequently isolated in mozambique may be nearly equally attributed both to ancestral and evolutionary modern m. tuberculosis lineages with a high spoligotype diversity documented for eai, lam and t lineages. the spoligotype diversity within these lineages suggests that they have circulated in mozambique for some time. spoligotype diversity was also evidenced for other pgg <dig> clade  as well as pgg2/ <dig> clades . however, the "t" genotype does not represent a clade in a strict evolutionary sense since it was defined by default to include strains that may not be classified in one of the established genotypic lineages with well-established phylogeographical specificity such as the h, lam, cas, and eai lineages  <cit> .

the wide diversity may be attributed to the extensive human movement in the country mainly due to mozambican migration to neighbouring countries and internal migration to look for better life conditions. the structure of the tb population is determined by geography, demography and human migration.

with the exception of ubiquitous spoligotypes , the patients in mozambique mainly harboured m. tuberculosis spoligotypes prevailing in eastern and southern africa. thus, in two studies conducted in tanzania lam  and eai were found to be abundant, although the cas  lineage was predominant  <cit> . in another study conducted in zimbabwe,  <dig>  of  <dig> isolates were lam  <dig>   <cit> . in kenya, on the other hand,  <dig> % of  <dig> isolates were of the cas lineage, while 11% were lam  <cit> .

a study conducted in zimbabwe, zambia and south africa identified a predominant group of strains  in zimbabwe and zambia with a unique spoligotype signature where spacers 21- <dig>  27- <dig> and 33- <dig> were deleted  <cit> . in our study, 44/ <dig>  isolates had the mentioned signature , five were orphan and  <dig> matched a pre-existing shared type in the sitvit <dig> or were newly-created either within the present study or after a match with an orphan in the database.

a remarkable feature was the presence of the ancestral manu lineage strains . at the time of this comparison, the sitvit <dig> database contained only  <dig> manu lineage isolates representing less than  <dig> % clinical isolates worldwide, out of which only  <dig> were isolated in africa , however none was yet reported from mozambique. furthermore, with the exception of  <dig> manu <dig> lineage strains isolated in tanzania, all the remaining m. tuberculosis strains isolated from africa belonged to the manu <dig> sublineage. hence our study constitutes the first evidence of the presence of the manu lineage in mozambique. with both beijing and euro-american strains  circulating in mozambique, some of the manu <dig> patterns on the other hand appear to result from mixed infections of beijing and euro-american tb. such a mixture has been described in adjacent south africa  <cit> .

sit <dig> corresponding to the beijing genotype was the third most frequent single spoligotype in mozambique. the beijing lineage has spread globally during recent years  <cit> , and is seen as an indicator strain for recent import of m. tuberculosis into a setting. interestingly, only one of the  <dig> beijing isolates was drug resistant ; in spite of the multidrug-resistance linked to this emerging clone worldwide. a high and increasing incidence of the beijing lineage has been described in neighbouring south africa. in a study conducted in cape town the proportion of w-beijing strains in children increased drastically from  <dig> to 33% from  <dig> to  <dig>  showing that this strain has a significant selective advantage to spread within the community  <cit> . in the same region, an association between the beijing lineage and hiv has recently been reported  <cit> . moreover, another study carried out in malawi demonstrates an increase over time of the proportion of tb due to beijing genotype strains  <cit> .

no m. africanum isolates were detected. m. africanum is highly prevalent in west african countries, with its epicentre in guinea bissau  <cit>  but is rarely seen in east and southern africa  <cit> . the m. tuberculosis genotype t2-uganda  was shown to be mainly responsible for the tb epidemic in kampala, uganda  <cit> , although not so common in other east african countries as kenya  <cit>  and the mozambican neighbour tanzania  <cit> . in our study, no strains of the m. tuberculosis genotype t2-uganda  <cit>  were found.

the total absence of m. bovis in this one year study is noteworthy. although bovine tb is an important disease of cattle and other domestic animals in mozambique, no m. bovis, the causative agent of bovine tb, was found. one reason could be that we have studied only sputum isolates. m. bovis is thought to spread through unpasteurized milk, and hence would mainly cause abdominal or disseminated tb.

this study represents a first baseline study of the m. tuberculosis population structure in mozambique, a useful guide for future epidemiological studies in the country and extending the picture of global tb distribution.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that the tb epidemic in mozambique is caused by a wide diversity of spoligotypes with predominance of four genotype lineages: lam, eai, t and beijing. the beijing genotype was the third most frequent single spoligotype in mozambique.
