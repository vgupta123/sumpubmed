BACKGROUND
rhizobia are widely occurring soil bacteria that are able to establish nitrogen-fixing symbioses with legumes. bacterium-plant interaction is a complex process in which specific plant and bacterial signals are exchanged resulting in formation of nodules, where rhizobia in the form of bacteroids fix nitrogen  <cit> .

rhizobial genomes are large and multipartite, composed of a single circular chromosome and a set of large plasmids  <cit> . the genes responsible for nodulation  and nitrogen-fixation  are either carried by large plasmids  or are incorporated in the chromosome as symbiotic islands  <cit> . large genomes of rhizobiaceae and bradyrhizobiaceae  are considered more ecologically advantageous in an environment that is scarce in nutrients but diverse as regards carbon and energy sources. these genomes are disproportionately enriched in regulation and transport genes and in genes involved in secondary metabolism in comparison with medium-and small-size genome containing bacteria  <cit> .

"core" and "accessory" components of rhizobium genomes can be distinguished. chromosomes with conserved gene content and order  are considered as core. accordingly, plasmids constitute the accessory genome. plasmids are more flexible than the chromosomes, as defined by more frequent gene gains and losses, even in the same species. they are heterogeneous in size and gene content and lack synteny even in closely related species, except for genes involved in plasmid replication and symbiotic properties  <cit> . in some species, such as rhizobium leguminosarum, plasmids may comprise up to 35% of the total genome  <cit> .

rhizobial plasmids are maintained in the cells via repabc cassettes, comprising genes required for active segregation  and initiation of replication   <cit> . the presence of several repabc operons within a single genome, which are subjected to individual selection pressure and divergence, could be the key element of the existence of different plasmid incompatibility groups in cells and could drive the rearrangement of gene organization and of their functions  <cit> . it was proposed that repabc plasmids coexisting in the same strain most probably emerged by separate events of lateral transfer, which required evolution of different incompatibility groups allowing simultaneous residence of plasmids equipped with a similar replication/partition system in a single bacterial species  <cit> . thus, the degree of divergence of the plasmid replication apparatus, whose sequence is subject to strong evolutionary pressure and determines the ability to evade incompatibility between plasmids  <cit> , and horizontal gene transfers are potential forces that shaped rhizobial genomes.

recently, some  extrachromosomal replicons that have properties distinct from both chromosome and plasmids were reported and named "chromids"  <cit> . chromids are characterized by presence of some important genes essential for growth under all conditions, with nucleotide composition and codon usage similar to the chromosome of the parental strain, and, by contrast, plasmid replication and partition systems  <cit> .

furthermore, recent analyses of rhizobium etli strains  <cit>  showed that this species has a pangenomic structure. by definition, a pangenome "determines the core genome, which consists of genes shared by all the strains studied and probably encoding functions related to the basic biology and phenotypes of the species"  <cit> . the basis of the pangenome concept emerged from an observation that each newly sequenced genome enriched the pool of species-specific genes with new ones  <cit> . this makes it possible to detect, besides the core genomes, the dispensable genomes composed of both chromosomal and plasmid genes, present only in some of the strains, which contribute to the species diversity and allow adaptation to new ecological niches and a specific environment. despite the overall genomic divergence, r. etli pangenome comprises a core genome composed of both chromosomal and plasmid sequences, as well as highly conserved symbiosis-related genes on the psym plasmid. the unusual variability observed in rhizobial genomes may further result from several types of alterations, such as point mutations, deletions, amplification of dna, and from intragenome re-assortment of sequences  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to evaluate the divergence of genomes of a small population of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  nodule isolates from clover plants grown in the same site in cultivated soil. like the other members of the genus rhizobium, the rlt genomes were partitioned into the chromosome and several large plasmids, one of which carried symbiosis-related genes. the variability of the genome architecture involved not only the number and size of the plasmids, but also the location of specific genes on the particular replicons. distribution of repabc operon markers and other genes in the three genome compartments: the chromosome, chromid-like and 'other plasmids' was assessed. we found "stable" genes that were permanently located in a specific genome compartment, as well as "unstable" ones, which were detected in different replicons of the sampled strains. sequences of selected chromosome and plasmid genes were subjected to an assessment of adaptation to a particular genome compartment by analyses of codon usage and codon adaptation index. a potential evolutionary pathway of rlt strains was proposed on the basis of gene sequences and their distribution.

methods
r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  strains
 <dig> r. leguminosarum isolates were obtained from nodules of red clover  growing in sandy loam . plants were grown on  <dig> m <dig> plot for six weeks between may and june  <dig>  afterwards, ten randomly chosen clover plants growing in each other's vicinity were harvested, the nodules were collected, surface-sterilized, crushed and their content plated on 79ca medium  <cit> . strains isolated from the nodules were purified by successive streaking of single colonies and pure cultures were used in further experiments.

dna methods
standard techniques were used for labeling of dna, southern hybridization and agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> . dna probes for southern hybridizations were obtained by pcr amplification with rtta <dig> genomic dna as template and appropriate primers . the probes were labeled with non-radioactive dig dna labeling and detection kit . southern blotting, gel pretreatment and capillary transfers were done using standard procedures  <cit> . hybridizations were performed at high stringency at 42°c using 50% formamide in pre-hybridization and hybridization solutions. analyses of the plasmid content of the  <dig> isolates were performed as described by eckhardt  <cit> .

preparation of high molecular weight dna and pfge conditions
the plugs were formed with  <dig> ml  <dig> h culture of rlt strains, which after centrifugation were resuspended in te buffer and mixed with 2% lmp agarose . agarose embedded cells were incubated with te and lysozyme  for  <dig> h at 37°c, and then in cell lysis buffer  supplemented with proteinase k  at 37°c for additional  <dig> h. the proteinase k was inactivated by pmsf  at 37°c for  <dig> h. plugs were washed tree times  with te buffer and finally stored in te at 4°c. pfge was performed with the contour-clamped homogenous electric field mode with the bio-rad system . dna samples were separated in 1% megabase agarose gels  in  <dig> × tae buffer, refrigerated at 12-14°c, with switch time 100- <dig> seconds, angle 106°, voltage gradient  <dig> v/cm for  <dig> h. estimation of plasmid size was performed with bio-profil biogene , using r. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain  <dig>  <cit> , r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii ta <dig>  <cit>  and sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig>  <cit> .

computer assisted analyses
sequence data were analyzed with lasergene analysis software . data base searches were done with the blast and fasta programs at the national centre for biotechnology information  and european bioinformatic institute . for the dna sequences multiple alignments clustal-w algorithm was used  <cit> . codon usage of sequenced genes was calculated using acua  <cit> . codon adaptation index  was calculated with cai program  <cit> . in codon usage discriminant analyses with two grouping methods were applied to studied sequences:  based on the localization of genes in defined part of the rhizobial genome , or  based on the origin of the genes . the results of this multivariate analysis give us the information about separation of studied groups on the basis of discriminant functions i.e. linear combinations of studied variables maximizing distances between groups and orthogonal to each other  <cit> .

for every grouping method set of variables included the relative frequency of alternative codons , leading to the investigation of  <dig> variables .

complete discriminant analysis was performed but from among many obtained results we focused on chi-squared test providing the number of statistically significant discriminant functions, squared mahalanobis distances between the group centroids , scatterplots of discriminant scores i.e. cases located in the property space formed by first two discriminant functions  <cit>  as well as the classification table containing information about the number and percent of correctly classified cases in each group.

the application of discriminant analysis was preceded by tolerance test, which enable us to remove redundant variables out of the model  <cit> . the tolerance tests were performed using classify/discriminant unit of spss software  while other results were obtained using discriminant function analysis units of statistica software system .

RESULTS
strain selection based on variable genomic organization
a group of  <dig> isolates was selected from among a collection of  <dig> r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  isolates recovered from nodules of ten clover plants grown in the vicinity of each other in cultivated soil. the main criterion of strain selection, beside the ability of effective nodulation of clover , was their different plasmid pattern obtained by eckhardt's lysis procedure . the strains harbored from  <dig> to  <dig> plasmids whose size, as assessed by pfge analysis of high molecular weight  genomic dna, ranged approximately from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb . the plasmids will be referred to as prlea to prlef throughout this report. the isolates that differed in the plasmid pattern were assumed to be distinct strains. in all the strains studied, the single symbiotic plasmid , with average molecular weight of  <dig> kb  was identified by southern hybridization with noda and nifne probes, derived from the r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii ta <dig>  laboratory strain  <cit> . a set of  <dig> strains  with a highly variable number and size of plasmids was chosen for further hybridization assays. noteworthy is the presence of very large plasmids with molecular weight above  <dig>  mb, identified in a majority of the sampled strains .

*-symbiotic plasmids

average molecular weight  of all the plasmids in each of the  <dig> isolates was calculated as  <dig>  mb . with regard to the average genome size ~ <dig>  mb of recently sequenced r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii wsm <dig>  and wsm <dig>   <cit> , in which extrachromosomal replicons constitute 34% and 36%, respectively, the extrachromosomal dna content in our strains was calculated to range from 26% to 45% .

similarity of replication-partition genes in the plasmid pool of selected strains
one of the methods to assess the phylogenetic relatedness among plasmids is to compare their replication systems. thus, at the beginning of our study, similarity and/or diversity of replication regions between the plasmids of the nodule isolates were examined. recently, the replication systems of four plasmids , each equipped with repabc genes, were analyzed in rtta <dig>  <cit> . an experimental approach comprising a series of southern hybridizations with repa and repc genes derived from plasmids prleta1a-prleta1d of rtta <dig> as molecular probes was used . the repa and repc genes were pcr amplified from the rtta <dig> genome and probed against pfge-separated hmw dna of the sampled strains. the choice of two different genes from each of the replication system identified in rtta <dig> as molecular probes seemed to be justified by lack of single universal phylogenetic history within the repabc operon and by repa and repb evolution, partially independent from repc  <cit> .

distribution of the given rep marker was assessed with regard to its location in one of the extrachromosomal replicons of the tested strains. repa and repc genes of the largest prleta1d were jointly detected on the largest plasmids in all the sampled rlt strains . similarly, repa and repc of the prleta1b jointly hybridized to one of the plasmids of different size in all the rlt strains. in contrast, repa and repc of the prleta1c were rarely localized together . the repa of the prleta1c was not similar to any of the plasmids in most of the sampled strains, but repc hybridized frequently  to psym plasmids. repa and repc of prleta1a  commonly showed sequence similarity to non-symbiotic plasmids of the sampled strains and only exceptionally hybridized to symbiotic ones .

repabc of prleta1d and prleta1b display similarity with replication systems of the extrachromosomal replicons, which were recently described as chromids  <cit> . within the group of closely related strains rtta <dig>  r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> , r. etli cfn <dig> , rltwsm <dig> and rltwsm <dig> clusters of replicons carrying the most similar replication systems can be distinguished. they comprise prleta1d-prl12-p42f-prlg201-pr <dig> and prleta1b-prl11-p42e-prlg202-pr <dig>  respectively. therefore, detection of positive hybridization signals with probes derived from rep genes of rtta <dig> chromid-like replicons  to any of the replicons of the sampled strains allowed regarding those as a chromid-like. based on the similarity of replication-partition genes detected in our assays, we divided the replicons of the studied strains into three genome compartments: chromosome, chromid-like and 'other plasmids' . the compartment designated 'other plasmids' also comprised psym. such replicon division was taken into consideration in the subsequent analyses of distribution of other markers in the studied strains.

variability of chromosomal and plasmid marker location
in further studies, the extent of gene content diversity in the sampled nodule isolates was examined. we aimed to estimate whether, besides repa and repc displacement events, we could demonstrate changes in the location of the chromosomal and plasmid genes. the same experimental approach was used, i.e. a series of southern hybridizations with different genes with a well-defined chromosomal or plasmid location in rtta <dig>   <cit> .

for assays of chromosomal marker variability, essential bacterial genes were chosen: rpoh <dig>  dnak, dnac, rrn, lpxq as well as genes that are not essential or with unspecified essentiality but chromosomal in rtta <dig>  i.e. bioa, stbb, exor, pssl  and rfbadbc  . in addition, location of fixgh genes was assayed, even though they are known to be plasmid located on the sequenced rltwsm <dig>  rltwsm <dig>  <cit> , rlv  <cit>  and rhe  <cit>  genomes, but chromosomal in rtta <dig>  <cit> .

a majority of the studied genes  were located on the chromosome in all the sampled strains, showing considerable conservation of chromosomal markers . exceptionally, the pss-v region was identified on the chromosome of the k <dig> , k <dig>  and rtta <dig> but it was missing in the other strains  moreover, fixgh symbiosis-related genes, which were chromosomal in the rtta <dig>  k <dig> , k <dig>  and k <dig>  strains, were located mainly in the genome compartment designated as 'other plasmids'  in the remaining strains. the variable location of fixgh genes which were found on the chromosome, psyms and chromid-like replicons  could be accounted for by location of these genes on the putative genomic island flanked by  <dig> bp repeats in r. leguminosarum and r. etli  <cit> .

southern hybridizations with probes comprising markers previously identified on different rtta <dig> replicons  <cit> , such as prc and hlyd of prleta1d; lpsb <dig>  orf16-orf17-otsb, taua and orf <dig> genes cluster of prleta1c; nada and pssm  of prleta1b, were carried out. these analyses demonstrated that prleta1d markers were almost always jointly detected in the largest chromid-like replicons . prleta1c markers in almost all  of the sampled strains were located in the genome compartment designated as 'other plasmids' . from among markers of prleta1b, nada, mind, huti and pcag had always chromid-like location, while the pssm gene was located in the chromosome of  <dig> strains, in chromid-like replicons of four strains including rtta <dig>  and was absent in the genome of k <dig>  strain, respectively .

besides the symbiotic genes noda and nifne used for identification of psym plasmids, stability of thic and acds  of the prleta1a symbiotic plasmid  was examined . only thic was identified in all the strains, however, located in different genomic compartments: most frequently on the chromosome , and in the 'other plasmids' . the acds gene was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> strains, in each case on psym . the thic gene, similarly to fixghi, showed high variability in location; however, its putative mobile element location is unknown  <cit> . thic was reported as plasmid located in sequenced genomes of rlv  <cit> , rlt <dig>  <cit>  and rhe  <cit> .

as a result, genes with a stable location in specific genome compartments in all the strains, as well as unstable genes with variable, strain-dependent distribution were distinguished . stable markers for each compartment of the sampled strains were established i.e. chromosomal: rpoh <dig>  exor, dnak, dnac, bioa, rrn, lpxq, pssl and stbb; chromid-like: prc, hlyd, nada, mind, huti and pcag; 'other plasmids': otsb, lpsb <dig> , taua and orf <dig>  including noda and nifne symbiosis-related genes of psym . loss of some of the examined markers was noticed, i.e. pss-v from the chromosome, pssm from chromid-like replicons, and acds from the 'other plasmids' . only two of the sampled strains, i.e. k <dig>  and k <dig> , contained all the studied markers, while others lacked at least one of the genes.

a dendrogram demonstrating similarity of the strains was constructed with the upgma clustering method based on markers distribution among their different genome compartments. it showed one k <dig>  strain apparently split from the others , and two groups of clustered strains: a small one, including rtta <dig>  k <dig>  and k <dig> , and a large one comprising the remaining strains, which was further subdivided into two smaller subgroups of strains with identical marker distribution .

sequence divergence of chromosomal and plasmid genes
to assess the overall phylogenetic similarity of the sampled strains, several genes from a subset of  <dig> different strains displaying divergent plasmid profiles  were partially sequenced and analyzed. the sequenced genes comprised exclusively chromosomal , chromid-like replicons , and 'other plasmid' markers  as well as those with unstable location found in different genome compartments . afterwards, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on concatenated sequences of a distinct genome compartment, allowing description of the genetic similarity of the strains using the multilocus sequences analyses  approach .

in general, a low number of nucleotide substitutions were found in the examined genes in most strains. similar groups of clustered strains were obtained in dendrograms constructed both on the basis of concatenated chromosomal sequences , as well as concatenated chromid-like replicon genes . in both cases, a smaller group containing rtta <dig>  k <dig>  and k <dig>  strains, and a larger group consisting of the remaining strains was observed. interestingly, k <dig>  chromosomal genes split off from all remaining strains suggesting their considerable divergence . sequence similarity within the rtta <dig>  k <dig>  and k <dig>  group is also visible on a dendrogram exclusively based on plasmid gene sequences, derived from psym . when all the concatenated sequences  were used in dendrogram construction, the grouping of the strains was very similar to that obtained on the basis of stable chromosomal markers . in conclusion, quite a similar phylogenetic history of the studied strains was demonstrated based on both stable and unstable chromosomal, chromid-like as well as 'other plasmid' genes .

to further evaluate the degree of sequence differentiation between the alleles with respect to their distribution in the genome and eo ipso the rate of adaptation to the genome compartment, we performed discrimination analyses focused on alternative codon usage. discrimination analysis was applied to  <dig> variables . genes belonging to the chromosome, chromid-like and 'other plasmids' differed substantially with respect to this parameter . apart from the well-separated sequences belonging to the three distinct genome compartments, one can observe a subgroup localized between chromosomal and 'other plasmids' gene pools . this subgroup comprised genes thic, fixgh, which frequently changed their location and their codon usage was not adapted to any genome compartment. comparison of the results of gene grouping based on hybridization data and discrimination analysis demonstrated very high accordance equal to 96%.

the discrimination analysis of codon usage performed on individual strains harboring the set of the tested genes  revealed only minor differences between the resultant groups and almost no accordance  with the grouping performed on the basis of hybridization. however, some level of similarity between the strains can be demonstrated. as a consequence, one more discrimination analysis of codon usage was done, and the strains were divided into three groups:  k <dig> ,  rtta <dig>  k <dig> , k <dig>  and  all the remaining strains . this resulted in 92% accordance between codon usage-based and strain-dependent grouping of sequences . it was concluded that codon usage was not significantly influenced by the individual strains but may be characteristic for the group of strains.

finally, the codon adaptation index  of the sequences studied was calculated. the cai can be used to "evaluate the extent to which selection has been effective in molding the pattern of codon usage"  <cit>  as well as to compare the codon usage of foreign genes versus that of highly expressed native genes  <cit> . here, we applied cai analyses to assess the degree of adaptation of sequenced genes to the host by comparing the obtained cai values with those of genes encoding ribosomal proteins in r. leguminosarum. the calculated cai values for each sequence were arbitrarily grouped and subsequently submitted to anova evaluation, which measures the significance of differences between groups. cai values can range from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> .

the cai values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the fixg and thic had the cai equal to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, suggesting weaker adaptation to their genome compartments and further confirming their unstable location as indicated in hybridization analyses. we did not find significant differences with respect to the cai values calculated for the particular strains, but strains rtta <dig>  k <dig> , k <dig> , and k <dig>  previously observed as most divergent had a high average cai of the studied sequences , possibly indicating good adaptation of the genes to the host. finally, the cai values were evaluated according to the location of genes in the different genome compartments . the cai values of genes located on the chromosome and chromid-like replicons were high and significantly differed from each other. the genes located on the 'other plasmids'  had the lowest cai values significantly different from the former ones. these results demonstrated weaker adaptation of plasmid genes to the host genome in comparison to the chromosome and chromid-like genes.

discussion
three genome compartments that differed genetically and functionally can be distinguished in the nodule population of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii: the chromosome, chromid-like and 'other plasmids' including psym. chromid-like replicons were distinguished in southern analyses on the basis of repa and repc sequence similarity to rtta <dig> and to the respective replication genes of such replicons described in the sequenced genomes of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae, r. etli and r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii  <cit> . the chosen name "chromid-like"  was the result of data scarcity concerning their gene content, insufficient to justify the name "chromid"  <cit> . moreover, it is known that genes of the repabc operon are peculiar genetic markers because of the complex phylogeny of particular genes within the operon, whose evolutionary history could not be strictly connected with other genes of particular replicons  <cit> .

in the study of the distribution of several chromosomal and plasmid markers within a group of  <dig> nodule isolates, stable genes permanently located in a specific r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii genome compartment: chromosome, chromid-like and 'other plasmids' including psym were distinguished. unstable genes  that changed their location at various rates or were lost from the genome were also detected. only two of the sampled  <dig> strains possessed all the studied markers. a majority of strains differed in the gene content and gene distribution, supporting the hypothesis of the pangenomic structure of r. leguminosarum, in which each strain of a given species contains, besides the core genome, additional genetic information specific for the strain  <cit> .

the distribution of the plasmid replication-partition genes was even more dynamic than that of genes not connected with replication. independent transfer events of repa and repc genes of the putative repabc operon were frequently observed, especially in the 'other plasmids' compartment, which confirmed different evolutionary pathways for various elements of the repabc operon, recently evidenced in alphaproteobacteria  <cit> . such considerable dynamics of replication/partition gene distribution in rhizobium may account for changes in the plasmid number and, consequently, gene content observed in the sampled population. beside the dynamics of replication/partition gene distribution, some level of conservation of replication genes, especially those of chromid-like replicons, was also observed. it was reflected in positive hybridizations with prleta1d and prleta1b derived rep probes, to the respective replicons of rlt strains. one could speculate that the conservation of replication genes of chromid-like replicons may be related with their distinct properties e.g. stability. however, the gene content rather than the properties of the replication system, resulting e.g. from conservation of replication genes, seem to be crucial for replicon stability  <cit> .

redistribution of genes between the different genome compartments could further trigger their sequence divergence under different selective pressures  <cit> . examination of sequence divergence of several stable and unstable chromosomal and plasmid genes showed a low level of substitutions in genes of all the compartments. nearly identical nucleotide sequences of nifne markers were found in different psym plasmids of the studied population , confirming the core character of symbiotic genes and their high conservation, despite the overall genome differentiation  <cit> .

the extent of gene adaptation to a given compartment in the host genome was assessed by analyses of alternative codon usage. three groups of well separated genes were obtained corresponding to the chromosome, chromid-like and 'other plasmids' genome compartments  with 96% accordance with hybridization data. in conclusion, the sequence divergence of particular genes may be affected by their location in the given genome compartment. when all the sequences of the individual strains studied were subjected to a discrimination analysis, we obtained good separation of k <dig>  and a group of strains related to rtta <dig>  that formed the outermost branch in the phylogenic tree. the remaining strains were randomly mixed with each other but apparently separated from k <dig>  and ta1-related strains, which suggested no differences in codon usage within the main group.

the cai analyses of the evaluated sequences confirmed good adaptation of chromosomal and chromid-like genes  to host genomes and lower cai values for 'other plasmids' genes. the cai values also reflect the level of transcriptional and translational activity of particular genes  <cit> . while the activity of most of the chromosomal and chromid-like genes could be considered at least to some extent constitutive, the 'other plasmids' and especially symbiosis-related genes are expressed only transiently in the symbiotic stage  <cit> . therefore, in the rhizobium model, the differences in codon usage in translation reflect the balance between the selection pressure and random mutations in the functionally differentiated genome compartments. the differences in codon usage and cai values between the genome compartments are most likely a consequence of differential gene expression and adaptability to optimal codon usage in host genomes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study showed that, even within a small rhizobial population of clover nodule isolates, substantial divergence of genome organization can be detected especially taking into account the content of extrachromosomal dna. despite the high variability with regard to the number and size of plasmids among the studied strains, conservation of the location as well as the dynamic distribution of the individual genes  of a particular genome compartment was demonstrated. the sequence divergence of particular genes may be affected by their location in the given genome compartment. the 'other plasmid' genes are less adapted to the host genome than the chromosome and chromid-like genes.
