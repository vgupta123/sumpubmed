BACKGROUND
the bunyaviridae family of segmented negative stranded  rna viruses constitutes a diverse group of over  <dig> members separated in five genera namely hantavirus, nairovirus, orthobunyavirus, phlebovirus, and tospovirus. together these viruses infect a bewildering array of animals and plants, as well as causing serious disease in humans. one of these human pathogens is crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever virus , which is a member of the nairovirus genus and is the causative agent of crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever , a human disease that can progress to haemorrhagic manifestations and death in up to  <dig> % of cases  <cit> . cchfv reservoirs are maintained in a wide variety of both wild and domestic mammals, and the virus is transmitted to humans by either cchfv-infected ticks of the hyalomma species, or from direct contact with the blood or tissue of an infected human or animal . cchfv is the second most widespread medically important arbovirus after dengue virus, and is currently endemic or potentially endemic in  <dig> countries throughout africa, asia, the middle east, the balkans and europe  <cit> . a recent in silico study predicted the continuing spread of cchfv to northern european countries  based on predicted increases in climate temperature that would lead to an expansion in the habitat suitable for the tick vector  <cit> . due to both the extreme pathogenicity of cchfv in humans, and a current lack of effective preventative or therapeutic measures, cchfv is classified within hazard group  <dig>  requiring the highest level of biological containment.

hazv is classified in the same serogroup as cchfv; however, hazv has not been documented to cause serious disease in humans and consequently is categorised as a hazard group  <dig> pathogen. the global distribution of hazv has not been thoroughly investigated, however antibodies against hazv have been detected in wild rodent sera  <cit> , and hazv has been isolated from ixodes redikorzevi ticks in western pakistan  <cit> . experimental infection of several different mammalian species  with both hazv and cchfv has resulted in successful virus replication  <cit> . in both cases the only animals that display clinical symptoms with fatal outcome are suckling mice and interferon receptor knockout mice  <cit> . given the similarity in cchfv and hazv disease progression in the interferon receptor knockout mouse model, it is thought that hazv could represent a valid model for cchfv infection, enabling the investigation of this serogroup of viruses and the development of antivirals without having to work in a containment level  <dig>  environment.

the genomes of cchfv and hazv comprise three negative sense rna segments, named small , medium  and large , which encode the nucleocapsid protein , the viral glycoproteins  and the viral rna dependent rna polymerase , respectively. as with all sns rna viruses, these rna segments are encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein  to form ribonucleoprotein  complexes  <cit> . genome encapsidation by n is required for multiple stages of the virus life cycle, including replication and transcription of the viral genome, as well as segment packaging during virus assembly  <cit> . for a comprehensive review on the molecular biology of these viruses refer to  <cit> .

the crystal structures of the full length cchfv n protein  have been reported from several different virus strains. n from the yl <dig> strain was determined to a resolution of  <dig>  Å  <cit> , n from the baghdad- <dig> strain to a resolution of  <dig>  Å  <cit> , and n from the ibar <dig> strain to  <dig>  Å  <cit> . these structures revealed two domains; a globular domain and an arm domain, which are linked by a flexible loop. the globular domain of the baghdad- <dig> strain is formed from  <dig> alpha helices which are derived from both the n- and the c-terminal regions of the n protein. alpha helices from the n-terminus surround the c-terminal alpha helices, which form the core of the globular domain  <cit> . two long and three short alpha helices form the arm domain, which extends away from the globular domain and is located in a different position in each of the three cchfv n crystal forms  <cit> . in all cases the structure of monomeric, rna free cchfv n was determined. cchfv n and hazv n share  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity , with hazv n encoding three extra amino acids in comparison to cchfv n. it is thought that cchfv n and hazv n perform the same function in their virus replication cycles, therefore to determine the extent of cchfv n and hazv n structural similarities we have solved the crystal structure of full length hazv n, at a resolution of  <dig>  Å.fig.  <dig> amino acid sequence alignment of cchfv n strains baghdad- <dig>  yl <dig> and ibar <dig> with hazv n strain jc <dig>  alignment was carried out using clustal omega and espript  <cit> . completely conserved residues are white with a red background. residues which do not share similar properties and are not conserved are black



RESULTS
expression and purification of hazv n
hazv n was expressed as an n terminal glutathione s-transferase  fusion protein  and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. following overnight incubation with human rhinovirus  3c protease to remove the gst tag, the oligomeric status of hazv n was investigated using size exclusion chromatography . hazv n eluted as several different species; the protein that eluted most rapidly likely represents hazv n multimer forms, and the slower eluting and most-abundant protein species likely represents the hazv n monomer . the cleaved gst co-eluted with the hazv n monomer due to the fact that gst has a molecular weight of  <dig> kda, and dimerises in solution  and so we concluded that sec was unsuitable for further hazv n purification.

hazv n was therefore purified from uncleaved gst-hazv n and gst by cation exchange chromatography using a resource s column . hazv n has an isoelectric point of  <dig> , therefore ion exchange was performed with all buffers equilibrated to ph  <dig>  where hazv n should be positively charged and bind to the negatively charged resource s column, and all other proteins should pass through the column without binding . hazv n was eluted from the column  as the concentration of nacl was increased from  <dig> mm to  <dig> m over  <dig> column volumes. cation exchange chromatography removed the majority of protein contaminants leaving only hazv n, then circular dichroism was used to analyse the thermal stabilities of both hazv n, and cchfv n proteins  as previously described  <cit> . when monitoring the ellipticity at  <dig> nm the melting temperature  of hazv n was found to be  <dig>  °c and of cchfv n is  <dig>  °c. this indicates both proteins are correctly folded and potentially share a similar secondary structure.fig.  <dig> hazv n purification by ion exchange chromatography. hazv n was separated from gst-hazv n and gst using ion exchange chromatography. a protein elution was monitered with an a <dig> absorbance trace; protein that flowed through the column without binding is represented by peak  <dig>  whereas protein that bound to the column and was then eluted by an increasing nacl gradient  forms peak  <dig>  b sds page analysis of peak  <dig> and peak  <dig>  peak  <dig> contains primarily hazv n, whereas peak  <dig> contains a mixture of proteins that flowed through the column without binding

crystallisation of hazv n and structure solution
hazv n was concentrated to  <dig> mg ml− <dig> and used in crystallisation trials. commercially available sparse matrix screens were initially used to determine conditions under which hazv n crystallised. successive rounds of optimisation were then performed to determine the condition under which the best diffracting crystals grew; the final diffraction data were collected from crystals that grew in  <dig> % peg  <dig> ,  <dig>  m sodium citrate ph  <dig>   <dig>  m nacl and  <dig> % dioxane.

after data collection, the structure of hazv n was solved by the molecular replacement method with the globular domain of cchfv n ; residues 1– <dig>  and 296– <dig> as the initial search model. the final structure of the full length hazv n model was refined to rcryst =  <dig>  % and rfree =  <dig>  % with good geometry: overall molprobity score =  <dig>  .

the crystallographic asymmetric unit  contains four hazv n monomers. a single hazv n monomer  is presented in fig.  <dig>  in each of the four hazv n monomers in the au, only  <dig> amino acid residues were built into the model; residues 187– <dig> are missing in the electron density and are thought to form a disordered loop that links the arm domain to the n terminus of the globular domain. in agreement with the circular dichroism data, hazv n is mostly alpha helical  and is composed of two distinct domains, a globular domain and an arm domain. the globular domain is formed from a central core comprising c-terminal helices α <dig> – α <dig>  surrounded by n-terminal helices α <dig> - α <dig> . the arm domain  extends away from the globular domain, and is formed from two long alpha helices , which are supported by a small three-helix bundle . there is a loop on the apex of the arm domain which exposes a potential caspase cleavage site , however it is unknown whether hazv n is cleaved during the course of the virus replication cycle. a single alpha helix  provides the only link visible in this model between the arm domain and the globular domain, as the loop linking the n-terminus of the globular domain to the arm domain  is not visible in the electron density and is presumed disordered.fig.  <dig> the crystal structure of the hazv n monomer and alignment of the sequence of hazv n with the secondary structural elements. a monomer a from the hazv n au. a blue sphere indicates the n-terminus and a red sphere indicates the c-terminus of hazv n. the globular domain contains amino acids residues from the n-terminus , and the c-terminus . the arm domain  is linked to c-terminus of the globular domain by a single alpha helix , and to the n-terminus by a disordered loop , which is not visible in this model. helices are numbered according to . b alignment of the sequence of hazv n with the secondary structural elements. alpha helices are numbered 1– <dig> from the n-terminus to the c-terminus. horizontal bars below the sequence are coloured according to  and indicate the position of the secondary structural elements in . helix α <dig> - helix α <dig> comprise the n-terminus of the globular domain, helix α <dig> – helix α <dig> the arm domain, and helix α <dig> – helix α <dig> the c-terminus of the globular domain. . tt denotes a strict β-turn and ɳ denotes a helix with  <dig> residues per turn. all models were generated using pymol



monomer interactions within the hazv n au
the four hazv n monomers in the au are arranged as two pairs of monomers running anti-parallel to each other. within each pair, contact is between six residues from both the apex of the arm domain and the supporting three helix bundle of one monomer  and the base of the globular domain of the second monomer . it is thought residue pro <dig> from the base of the globular domain from one monomer is buried within a hydrophobic pocket formed from the six residues on the arm domain of the second monomer .fig.  <dig> crystallographic interfaces between adjacent hazv n monomers in the au. a interaction between hazv n monomers is thought to occur between pro <dig> on the base of the globular domain, which is buried in a hydrophobic pocket is formed by six residues  of the arm domain of an adjacent monomer. b the arrangement of hazv n monomers in the au: two pairs of monomers are packed anti-parallel to each other. electron density for the 4th monomer  was poor compared to the other monomers in the au. potential lateral interactions between hazv n monomers are indicated by vertical arrows. all models were generated using pymol



interestingly, hazv n and the cchfv n monomers in the au of all three cchfv n structures are packed in a similar way, with the base of the globular domain of one monomer making contact with residues on the arm domain of the adjacent monomer. this interaction between adjacent monomers results in the formation of long helical chains of hazv n and cchfv n, which are visible throughout each of the four different crystal forms. the helical chains of n have been well described by wang et al.  <cit> . the buried surface area at this site is also conserved . the conserved nature of this interaction between multiple crystal forms suggests it may be a common feature of nairovirus n proteins, and the structures observed in the crystals may reflect those that form during rnp assembly in infected cells. the fact that the pairs of monomers in the hazv n au are arranged anti-parallel to each other suggests this potential multimerisation arrangement resembles that recently reported for influenza a virus  rnps, which comprise two anti-parallel n-rna strands connected by a short loop at one end, and associated with the polymerase complex at the other end  <cit> . however, in contrast to the interaction between the base of one globular domain and the arm domain of the adjacent monomer, the lateral interaction between the pairs of monomers in the hazv n au is not conserved and varies between hazv n and the three cchfv n crystal forms .

hazv n protein electrostatic surface potential in relation to proposed function
as hazv n is a proposed rna binding protein, the electrostatic surface potential of hazv n was analysed to identify potential rna binding sites. surface representations of the hazv n protein colour-coded red to blue according to charge  are presented in fig.  <dig>  the surface representation of hazv n reveals several areas of positive charge , which are often associated with an increase in rna binding potential. hazv n has a positively charged ‘platform’ adjacent to the arm domain  in a similar position to a positively charged platform on the surface of the cchfv n protein. this platform is one of the largest areas of continuous positive charge on the surface of both hazv n and cchfv n, and was therefore suggested to be a possible rna binding site. another possible rna binding site is a crevice on the opposite face of the hazv n monomer to the positively charged platform . this crevice contains positively charged residues and extends across the length of the globular domain from helix α <dig> at the beginning of the arm domain, to the base of the globular domain. this crevice is also present in the cchfv n model, and rna sequestered here could be protected from degradation.fig.  <dig> surface representation of apo-hazv n electrostatic potential. the electrostatic surface potential of hazv n is shown colour coded from red  to blue  in dimensionless units of kb.t/ec, where kb is boltzmann’s constant, t is the temperature, and ec is the charge of an electron . potential rna binding sites, the platform and the crevice are labeled

we previously revealed structural similarity between the globular domain of the cchfv n protein and the n-terminal rna binding domain of the nucleocapsid protein  of lassa virus , which is a segmented negative stranded rna virus classified within the arenaviridae family  <cit> . not surprisingly, we show here that the hazv n protein also is structurally similar to lasv np. overlay of hazv n with rna-bound lasv np strongly suggests that the hazv n protein residues within the ‘crevice’ mediate rna binding .fig.  <dig> model of hazv n bound to rna. after superposition of the hazv n core domain with the n structure from lassa bound to rna, the lassa protein has been removed to leave a model for how hazv n may bind to rna 



the structure of hazv and cchfv n in relation to other bunyavirus n proteins
hazv n and cchfv n likely perform the same function in their viral replication cycles, and share approximately  <dig> % sequence identity; this is reflected in their structural similarity. superposition of hazv n with cchfv n strain baghdad- <dig>  reveals that the globular domains of these proteins align extremely closely , as do the arm domains . however the relative position of the arm domain with respect to the globular domain varies between the two structures . the arm domain of cchfv n is rotated by  <dig> ° around a pivot at serine  <dig> when compared with the arm domain of hazv n resulting in a translation of  <dig>  Å of the tip of the arm domain .

indeed, the arm domain adopts a different position in all three cchfv n crystal structures as well as in the hazv n structure . different amino acid sequences could account for the change in the position of the arm domain, or the difference in the position of the arm could be related to differences in crystal packing. however the flexibility in the n protein of cchfv and hazv that allows the arm domain to adopt different positions is likely a fundamental property of these proteins that allows them to carry out their function effectively.

the structure of the n protein of several members of the bunyaviridae family of segmented rna viruses have recently been solved, including that of rift valley fever virus, bunyamwera virus, schmallenberg virus, leanyer virus, toscana virus and la crosse virus . although the nucleocapsid proteins of bunyaviruses are structurally diverse  they do all possess at least two separate domains; a largely alpha-helical globular domain with a positively charged groove that binds viral rna, and another domain that is often arm-like and which is involved in oligomerisation of neighbouring globular rna binding domains. these domains are linked by highly flexible hinge regions that allow n proteins to adopt a number of different conformations, which enables the formation of rnps having variable morphologies  <cit> . it has been proposed that the flexibility of the sns rnps may be required for different stages of the virus replication cycle, such as genome replication and segment packaging. for example, the viral genomic rna strands form open circular pan-handle structures mediated in part by sequence-specific interactions with the viral polymerase  <cit> , as well as complimentary base pairing between the rna strand termini. when encapsidated by n, it is thought the inherent flexibility of the rnp chain may be essential to allow the physically distant rnp ends to find each other to permit this intra-terminal interaction to occur  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the crystal structure of hazv n to a resolution of  <dig>  Å and found the structure of hazv n to be very similar to the structure of cchfv n, supporting the use of hazv as a model for cchfv infection. the n proteins of cchfv and hazv both contain a globular domain and an extended arm domain that are linked by a flexible hinge region. although both domains of cchfv n and hazv n superpose on one another closely, the arm is in a different position in each structure. however the arm is also in a different position in all three cchfv n models, possibly reflecting the inherent flexibility between these two domains. the different arm positions in each model means that the angle between the core of one monomer and the core of the adjacent monomer are different in the helical arrays mediated by the well conserved arm:core interactions . the different arm position may well reflect a real function, and the differences in helical arrangements of the protomers may reflect different n conformations that form during the viral replication cycle – rnp assembly, transcription and replication for instance. the identification of areas of structural similarity between cchfv and hazv n could potentially be exploited in the structure-guided design of small molecule inhibitors, whose efficacy against hazv could be rapidly tested under cl- <dig> conditions, prior to testing against cchfv.
