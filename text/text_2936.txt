BACKGROUND
plant metabolism strongly depends on the availability of visible light as it is the driving force for photosynthesis which converts carbon dioxide into organic compounds that are used by the plant for growth and development  <cit> . the light reaction of oxygenic photosynthesis is characterized by water oxidation and by the light driven transport of the electrons from water to nadp producing a proton gradient that facilitates the synthesis of atp  <cit> . one key problem of this process is the constant generation of reactive oxygen species  such as singlet oxygen, superoxide hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . if not detoxified these substances are capable of oxidizing membrane components and proteins and can lead to the degradation of nucleic acids, lipids, pigments, membranes, proteins, rna, and dna, causing mutation and eventually cell death  <cit> . the generation of ros is naturally higher when plants are exposed to high light conditions as it overstrains the electron transport chain  <cit> . thus, plants have to adapt to high light conditions by several metabolic and morphological changes such as reduction in the size of the light-harvesting complex  <cit> , by an increase in the number of cells layers within leaves  <cit> , and by the movement of chloroplasts and leaves in order to avoid the light source  <cit> . other effective defense mechanism against high light include non-photochemical quenching which dissipates excess light as heat  <cit> , and the detoxification of ros by enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, oxidoreductases or antioxidants  <cit> . antioxidants are molecules which are able to detoxify ros by reducing them into less harmful substances or by inhibiting the oxidation of other molecules  <cit> . besides carotenoids and α-tocopherol, which are lipohilic antioxidants within chloroplasts  <cit> , two global antagonists against ros are the water soluble antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione. as reducing agents they play important roles during the elimination of ros individually or through the ascorbate glutathione cycle  <cit> . in opposite to carotenoids and α-tocopherol, which antioxidative effects in plants are restricted to the chloroplasts, ascorbate and glutathione and related enzymes can be found in different concentrations in the different cell compartments  <cit> . thus ascorbate and glutathione can protect plants from oxidative damage in other cell compartments besides chloroplasts as well. considering that h2o <dig> production is just as high in peroxisomes during photosynthesis as a result of glycolate oxidation in the photorespiratory pathway  <cit>  and that ros can leak from chloroplasts and peroxisomes in other cell compartments such as vacuoles and the cytosol  <cit> , sufficient levels of ascorbate and glutathione in the different cell compartments are important for the plant to fight ros during high light conditions. in arabidopsis plants highest levels of ascorbate were found in peroxisomes and the cytosol and lowest ones in vacuoles with intermediate labeling in nuclei, mitochondria and plastids  <cit>  whereas glutathione contents were found to be highest in mitochondria followed by nuclei, the cytosol, peroxisomes, plastids and vacuoles  <cit> . changes in subcellular ascorbate and glutathione contents during abiotic and biotic stress are valuable stress indicators within plants and can determine the fate of the plant during situation of oxidative stress.

the aim of this study was to investigate subcellular changes in ascorbate and glutathione contents in arabidopsis plants during the exposure to different low and high light conditions  in order to clarify the dynamic compartment specific protection of these key antioxidants against ros produced during high light conditions. plants grown at 150 μmol m-2 s- <dig> were considered as controls  as this light intensity is considered to be ideal for growing arabidopsis plants and commonly used in experiments involving arabidopsis thaliana. different light intensities were applied for 4 h or  <dig> d in order to evaluate differences in short and long term adaptation strategies of the antioxidant system to high light intensities. additionally, we compared dynamic changes of the antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione in ascorbate and glutathione deficient mutants, vtc2- <dig>   <cit>  and pad2- <dig>   <cit> , respectively, in order to clarify possible compensatory effects of low ascorbate and glutathione contents by glutathione and ascorbate, respectively. other parameters such as catalase activity and h2o <dig> contents, number of chloroplasts and changes in the fine structure of chloroplast were additionally monitored in order to correlate different defense and adaptation strategies of arabidopsis plants to changes in the antioxidative protection during high and low light conditions.

RESULTS
high light intensity had a major impact on the appearance and anatomy of the leaves  and also altered the overall phenotypes of the plants. plants exposed to high light conditions formed the same amounts of rosettes as plants grown under control conditions. whereas fully developed leaves from older rosettes  developed a similar size as leaves grown under control conditions leaves developed after the exposure to high light conditions remained much smaller. thus, leaves from the 3rd and 4th rosette which were taken for the investigations described in this study had similar size and developmental stage . these results differ from the overall phenotypes of wildtype plants and vtc <dig> mutants which were much smaller when grown for full 6 weeks under high light conditions  <cit>  but are similar to phenotypes of the same plants exposed in adult stage for 5 days to high light conditions  <cit> . when leaves of arabidopsis thaliana col- <dig> were exposed to a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> first blue spots -indicating the accumulation of anthocyanins in vacuoles- were visible on the leaves and on the main vascular vein . on leaves of the wildtype small necrotic spots on the edge of the leaves could be observed when the plants were exposed to 700 μmol m-2 s- <dig> . the pad2- <dig> and vtc2- <dig> mutants showed dark blue stained areas on the leaves at this light intensity but necrotic spots were not visible . when leaves were exposed to  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> advanced browning and necrotic areas at the leaf edge could be observed on arabidopsis col- <dig>  the vtc2- <dig> and pad2- <dig> mutants . investigations of leaf anatomy by light microscopy revealed that wildtype plants and the pad2- <dig> and vtc2- <dig> mutants grown at a light intensity of  <dig> and 150 μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d showed a similar ultrastructure with one tightly-packed palisade cell layer and three layers of spongy parenchyma cells with many intercellular spaces between the upper and lower epidermis cell layer . at a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> leaves of the wildtype plants and the pad2- <dig> mutant contained two tightly-packed layers of palisade cells and three layers of loosely arranged spongy parenchyma cells . in vacuoles of epidermis cells of leaves from wildtype plants dark stained precipitations indicating the accumulation of anthocyanins could be observed . when plants were exposed to light intensities of  <dig> and  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d the accumulation of anthocyanins became more prominent and could also be found in palisade and spongy parenchyma . at these light intensities a differentiation between palisade and spongy parenchyma was difficult in leaves of the wildtype and the vtc2- <dig> as large intercellular spaces appeared in both cell layers. additionally, the palisade parenchyma was reduced to one cell layer . leaves of the pad2- <dig> mutants exposed to a light intensity of  <dig> and  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d showed similar anatomy as plants exposed to 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d containing two tightly-packed palisade cell layers and about  <dig> to  <dig> layers of spongy parenchyma. in general leaves of the wildtype, pad2- <dig> and vtc2- <dig> mutants appeared thicker at  <dig> and 700 μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d in comparison to leaves exposed to the other light intensities .

subcellular changes of ascorbate and glutathione labeling were investigated by transmission electron microscopy  4 h and  <dig> d after the application of different light intensities on arabidopsis thaliana col- <dig> plants and the vtc2- <dig> and pad2- <dig> mutant. the distribution of glutathione and ascorbate specific gold labeling in wildtype plants and the mutants grown at this light intensity was similar as observed in previous studies  <cit> .

chl contents
contents of chl a, b and carotenoids of plants exposed to control conditions did not significantly differ between the wildtype , pad2- <dig>  and vtc2- <dig> mutants . a significant decrease in chl a and b contents  was observed when plants were exposed to 700 μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d in comparison to wildtype plants raised at control conditions . when wildtype plants were exposed to  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> chl a, b and carotenoids contents were significantly decreased of 56%, 45%, and 41%, respectively when compared to wildtype plants exposed to control conditions . leaves of the pad2- <dig> mutant contained significant less chl a, b and carotenoid contents when plants were exposed to a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> , 700 μmol m-2 s- <dig> , and  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig>  and compared to pad2- <dig> mutants raised at control conditions . chl a, b and carotenoid contents were strongly decreased in leaves of the vtc2- <dig> mutants when exposed to a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> , 700 μmol m-2 s- <dig> , and  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig>  and compared to vtc2- <dig> mutants raised at control conditions .

catalase activity was significant increased after the exposure of wildtype plants, pad2- <dig> and vtc2- <dig> mutants to a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> for 4 h . a similar increase of 109% , 122%  and 59%  could be observed in these plants when exposed to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for 4 h in comparison to plants exposed to control conditions . wildtype plants, pad2- <dig> and vtc2- <dig> mutants showed significant decreased activity of catalase  when exposed to a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d and compared to the same plants raised at control conditions. a significant decrease of 27% and 41% was found in wildtype plants and the vtc2- <dig> mutants, respectively when they were exposed for  <dig> d to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> . contents of h2o <dig> in plants exposed to control conditions for 4 h and  <dig> d did not significantly differ between the wildtype , pad2- <dig>  and vtc2- <dig> mutants . these results correlated well with the situation on the subcellular level where an accumulation of h2o <dig> visualized by cecl3-staining within the cells could not be observed . after the exposure of wildtype plants, pad2- <dig> and vtc2- <dig> mutants to a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- <dig> for 4 h a significant increase in h2o <dig> contents of 63%, 85%, and 95%, respectively, could be observed when compared to plants exposed to control conditions. a similar increase of 94% , 74%  and 89%  could be observed in these plants when exposed to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for 4 h . under these conditions h2o <dig> accumulation visualized by cecl3-staining could mainly be observed along the tonoplast and within vacuoles but also occurred in the cytosol and in cell walls in wildtype plants . no significant differences were observed when plants were exposed to high light conditions for  <dig> d .

discussion
compartment specific analysis of ascorbate and glutathione in arabidopsis plants exposed to different light conditions revealed several important aspects for the subcellular protection of these antioxidants against ros production during high light stress. the application of a short high light stress  induced a drastic increase in overall glutathione and ascorbate labeling in wildtype plants. on the subcellular level glutathione accumulated in chloroplasts, peroxisomes and the cytosol reaching highest values in plants exposed to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig>  whereas ascorbate accumulated under these conditions in chloroplasts and vacuoles. these results highlight the importance of these antioxidants in chloroplasts and peroxisomes in the detoxification of ros that are formed in these cell compartments and accumulate in the tissue within a few hours during high light conditions due to disturbance in the electron transport chain and photorespiration, respectively  <cit> . nevertheless, the accumulation of h2o <dig> in the tissue observed in this study indicates that the ascorbate-glutathione cycle and other defense mechanisms  were not capable of detoxifying h2o <dig> at a rate necessary to reduce and control h2o <dig> contents under high light conditions. it has been proposed recently that under such circumstances h2o <dig> would leak into the cytosol and vacuoles  <cit> . such effects could be verified in this study as cecl3-staining revealed the accumulation of h2o <dig> mainly in these two cell compartments in wildtype plants. this could be one explanation for the strong increase of ascorbate in vacuoles of wildtype plants as it is involved in the detoxification of h2o <dig> that diffuses into vacuoles  where ascorbate helps to reduce phenoxyl radicals  and is oxidized to mono- and dehydroascorbic acid which is then transported into the cytosol for reduction to ascorbic acid  <cit> .

after the exposure of wildtype plants to high light for  <dig> d most cell compartments contained highest subcellular glutathione and ascorbate contents when plants were exposed to a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s- or 700 μmol m-2 s- <dig> and a strong decrease after the exposure to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig>  these changes correlated with a significant reduction of chl and carotenoid contents and the accumulation of anthocyanins after the exposure of wildtype plants to a light intensity of  <dig> and  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d. these results complement previous studies that have demonstrated increased global ascorbate levels in whole leaves exposed to long term high light conditions  <cit>  and correlate well with the increase of the overall ascorbate labeling of up to 200% calculated for the whole leaf in this study. excess light represents a potential danger to the plant as it leads to the accumulation of ros by overstraining the reactions in chloroplasts during photosynthesis  <cit> . thus, an accumulation of ascorbate and glutathione, especially in chloroplasts as observed in wildtype plants that were exposed to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> seems to be a logical consequence in order to avoid an excess production of ros. as h2o <dig> contents remained at control levels in wildtype plants exposed to excess light for  <dig> d it seems that the observed compartment specific adaptation in ascorbate and glutathione contents as well as modification of leaf structure , accumulation of anthocyanins in vacuoles, decrease in chl contents, and adaptations of chloroplast fine structure were sufficient for the adaptation of wildtype plants to excess light conditions to avoid excess production of h2o <dig>  chloroplasts of wildtype plants showed a strong decrease in chl and carotenoid contents with increasing light conditions which was similar as observed under comparable conditions  <cit>  and correlated with a decrease in thylakoid contents, chloroplast size and starch contents in the wildtype. similar effects have been observed during drought stress in spinach and spruce tree where a decrease in starch contents, chloroplast size and an increase in plastoglobuli size could be observed  <cit> . an increase in plastoglobuli size was also observed in the present study in correlation with the exposure to high light conditions and decreasing thylakoid contents. such a correlation seems likely during high light conditions as plastoglobuli are considered to be an important storage subcompartment of degrading thylakoid membranes  <cit>  and play an important role in the breakdown of carotenoids  <cit> .

in order to clarify the compartment specific importance of ascorbate and glutathione in the protection against high light conditions, subcellular ascorbate and glutathione contents were also evaluated in mutants deficient in ascorbate and glutathione contents. the glutathione deficient pad2- <dig> mutant, showed a significant increase in glutathione and ascorbate contents only in mitochondria  after the exposure to different high light regimes for 4 h which highlights the importance of glutathione and ascorbate in mitochondria for cell survival in situation of stress. the pad2- <dig> mutant, which develops a phenotype similar to the wildtype, is characterized by glutathione levels similar to col- <dig> in mitochondria, despite a strong drop of glutathione in all other cell compartments of up to 90%  <cit> . in previous studies we have demonstrated that distorted plant development is correlated with low glutathione contents in mitochondria as the glutathione deficient rml <dig> mutant which develops a severe phenotype  <cit>  shows a decrease in glutathione contents in all cell compartments including mitochondria of up to 97%  <cit> . thus, we can conclude that the accumulation of antioxidants in mitochondria during high light conditions in the pad2- <dig> mutant seems to be an important mechanism for the survival of plants with low glutathione contents during situation of stress. long term exposure to high light conditions induced a strong decrease of glutathione and ascorbate contents in the pad2- <dig> mutant. only chloroplasts and peroxisomes reacted with unchanged levels of glutathione and ascorbate, respectively. nevertheless, in comparison to the wildtype which showed a strong decrease in ascorbate contents in peroxisomes the pad2- <dig> mutant showed about 470% higher levels of ascorbate in peroxisomes after the exposure to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d. such effects could not be found for chloroplasts, where ascorbate contents were about 50% lower than in the wildtype which indicates that the accumulation of ascorbate in peroxisomes in the glutathione deficient pad2- <dig> mutant might be an important long term strategy to detoxify h2o <dig> which is produced in peroxisomes under high light conditions  <cit> . this conclusion is supported by the observation that chloroplast number, fine structure, chl contents, h2o <dig>  catalase behaved similar as the wildtype and the vtc2- <dig> mutant to high light conditions, indicating that the pad2- <dig> did not suffer more oxidative stress than the other plants. nevertheless, the pad2- <dig> mutant had thicker leaves with two palisade cell layers than the wildtype and the vtc2- <dig> mutant which both had only one palisade cell layer when exposed to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d. thus the increase in leaf thickness at this light intensity seems to be an additional strategy of the pad2- <dig> mutant in order to adapt to high light conditions. an increase in leaf thickness and higher leaf mass per unit area due to more cell layers is a commonly observed adaptation strategy to high light conditions also in other plant species  <cit> .

the ascorbate deficient vtc2- <dig> mutant reacted to high light conditions with a surprising strong increase of ascorbate in most cell compartments during long and short time exposure, despite alterations in ascorbate synthesis  <cit> . glutathione was increased in most cell compartments after the exposure to high light conditions for  <dig> d but remained mostly unchanged during short term exposure. these results correlated well with the calculated overall labeling density of ascorbate and glutathione, which was significantly increased of up to 50% and 215%, respectively, when vtc2- <dig> mutants were exposed to high light conditions for  <dig> d. these results are in line with an accumulation of total ascorbate and glutathione contents in vtc2- <dig> mutants observed after the long term exposure to high light  <cit>  but extend the data on the subcellular level. there it becomes obvious that the strongest accumulation of glutathione in the vtc2- <dig> mutant was found in chloroplasts where an increase of 600% could be observed when plants were exposed to a light intensity of  <dig>  μmol m-2 s- <dig> for  <dig> d. additionally, ascorbate accumulated in chloroplasts under these conditions indicating that the accumulation of both ascorbate and glutathione in chloroplasts are an important adaptation strategy of the vtc2- <dig> mutant to high light stress. the vtc2- <dig> mutants contain about 60–80% less ascorbate under low light conditions than the wildtype  <cit>  and despite an increase in ascorbate levels during high light stress, vtc2- <dig> plants did not reach wildtype levels. thus, the accumulation of glutathione in chloroplasts and also in the other cell compartments observed in this study seem to be an important adaptation strategy of the vtc2- <dig> mutant especially as other mechanisms could be ruled out in this study as catalase, chl contents, thylakoid contents, leaf anatomy, chloroplast number and the accumulation of h2o <dig> behaved similar to what has been observed in the wildtype and the pad2- <dig> mutant. another interesting aspect in the vtc2- <dig> mutant is the general accumulation of glutathione  in nuclei at high light conditions reaching or even succeeding levels found in the wildtype. it has been proposed previously that the accumulation of reduced glutathione could serve to protect dna and redox-sensitive nuclear proteins from oxidation, as well as driving glutaredoxin-related processes. this will influence the binding of transcription factors which will results in adaptations of gene expression patterns. additionally, glutathione can bind to nuclear proteins and protect them from oxidation  <cit> . an accumulation of glutathione in nuclei, followed by a depletion from the cytosol has also been related to increased synthesis and rapid accumulation of cellular glutathione contents  <cit> . thus, it is very well likely that the massive accumulation of glutathione in nuclei of the vtc2- <dig> is additionally used to activate glutathione synthesis in order to increase cellular glutathione contents in this mutant. this hypothesis is supported by the general accumulation of glutathione in the vtc2- <dig> as discussed above and by the observation that a similar accumulation has not been observed in col- <dig> and pad2- <dig> mutant during high light conditions.

another interesting aspect of the adaptation of plants to high light stress was the obvious accumulation of ascorbate and glutathione inside the thylakoid lumen in wildtype, pad2- <dig> and vtc2- <dig> mutants exposed to high light conditions . ascorbate inside the thylakoid lumen is important in respect to non-photochemical quenching which decreases the formation of ros by dissipation of excess absorbed light as heat. one important mechanism for non-photochemical quenching is the formation of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin that is catalyzed by the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase. this enzyme is located inside the thylakoid lumen and uses ascorbic acid as a reductant  <cit> . additionally, ascorbate can be used as an alternative electron donor by photosystem ii and i which is especially important in situation of stress when the linear electron transport is impaired  <cit> . thus, the accumulation of ascorbate in the thylakoid lumen of plants exposed to high light conditions and the general increase inside the stroma highlights the importance of high ascorbate contents for the compartment specific protection of chloroplasts during high light conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
summing up, we can conclude that in arabidopsis wildtype plants the accumulation of ascorbate and glutathione especially in chloroplasts, peroxisomes and the cytosol and an increased activity of catalase and enzymes involved in the ascorbate glutathione cycle are important mechanisms to protect plants against ros produced during high light stress in the short term. long term exposure to excess light caused an accumulation of ascorbate and glutathione in chloroplasts and several other adaptations such as the accumulation of anthocyanins in vacuoles, decrease in chl contents and adaptations of chloroplast fine structure. additionally, the accumulation of ascorbate in vacuoles of wildtype plants indicates an important role of this antioxidant in vacuoles for the detoxification of h2o <dig> leaking from peroxisomes and chloroplasts into the cytosol and vacuoles . the accumulation of ascorbate in peroxisomes in the glutathione deficient pad2- <dig> mutant and of glutathione in the chloroplasts of the ascorbate deficient vtc2- <dig> mutant relative to the wildtype col- <dig> during long term exposure to high light conditions indicates an important role of these antioxidants in these cell compartments in order to protect the mutants against high light conditions.
