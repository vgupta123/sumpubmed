BACKGROUND
nuclear receptors  are one of the most abundant classes of transcription factors in metazoans and coordinate diverse processes ranging from developmental patterning to physiological regulation. nrs appear to be restricted to animals because extensive work has shown nuclear receptors are present in all metazoan phyla  but not in plants, fungi or choanoflagellates  <cit> . the signature motifs of nrs are the dna-binding domain , which includes a cys-cys zinc coordinating region, and the ligand-binding domain , a carboxy-terminal domain that binds ligands and facilitates receptor dimerization and coactivator recruitment . high sequence conservation within these domains, particularly the dbd, has permitted identification of nrs from a number of animals and phylogenetic analysis of the nr superfamily  <cit> .

genes in the nr superfamily have been classified into six major nr families, many of which are further divided into subfamilies of orthologs and paralogs. all six families are represented in both the protostome and deuterostome lineages, supporting the hypothesis that nrs had undergone extensive radiation prior to the divergence of triploblastic animals. an analysis by bertrand et al.  <cit>  of nrs from nine bilaterian genomes did much to resolve the evolutionary history of this superfamily. they inferred  <dig> nrs that likely existed in the urbilaterian with at least one gene from each of the six families. after this divergence, many nrs underwent extensive duplication in the vertebrates, particularly fishes, and one gene underwent extensive duplication in nematodes  <cit> . with the increasing availability of sequenced genomes and pcr-based surveys of nr diversity, particularly from non-ecdysozoan protostomes  <cit> , it has become apparent that a number of nrs have also been lost since the urbilaterian ancestor, particularly in insects and nematodes.

because the nr superfamily had already diversified prior the divergence of the protostomes and deuterostomes, it is essential to characterize nrs in "basal" metazoans to understand not only when the nr families evolved but also the evolutionary relationships among these families. nrs have been reported from a handful of cnidarians from three of the four classes  and two sponges  <cit> . sequence and phylogenetic analyses of identified nrs have led these authors to suggest that many or all of these genes belong to nr family  <dig> with homologs of tll  in corals  <cit> , hnf <dig>  in coral  <cit>  and sponge  <cit> , rxr  in the box jelly  <cit> , and coup-tf  in coral and hydra .

despite the importance of understanding how nr regulation of development and physiology has evolved, little has been reported regarding the expression and function of nrs in non-bilaterian animals. some cnidarian nrs have been shown to share conserved features with their vertebrate orthologs. for example, the rxr homolog in the box jelly tripedalia cystophora specifically binds 9-cis retinoic acid with an affinity similar to that of vertebrate rxrs, supporting a conserved function of rxr in these evolutionary distant taxa  <cit> . the coup-tf homolog from hydra is expressed in neuronal cells, suggesting an evolutionary origin in nerve cell specification  <cit> . many of the identified nrs in cnidarians are orphan receptors . cnidarian tissues contain diverse lipids including prostaglandins, fatty acids, sterols and steroids, and it is plausible that some of these compounds act as ligands for nuclear receptors  <cit> . in addition, the developmental expression of most cnidarian nrs remains uncharacterized. temporal patterns of expression can provide significant insight into the potential role for nrs during development and metamorphosis as well as the opportunity for co-expressed nrs to interact with one another  <cit> .

here we present the first genomic analysis of nuclear receptors in the starlet sea anemone, nematostella vectensis, and quantify expression of all identified nrs throughout the life cycle. we identified seventeen nuclear receptors in the genome of n. vectensis. many of the nrs did not show clear orthology to bilaterian nrs, and some n. vectensis nrs appear to have resulted from lineage specific gene duplications. expression of most nrs varied significantly during development, with clusters of nrs exhibiting similar expression patterns.

RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships of n. vectensis nuclear receptors
we identified  <dig> nrs from n. vectensis with a combination of bioinformatic searches of the assembled n. vectensis genome  <cit> . we have designated these as nvnr1- <dig> . all of these genes were amplified from cdna preparations and confirmed as expressed transcripts.

when dbd plus lbd were used for phylogenetic analyses of n. vectensis and bilaterian nrs, the topology of the tree with the highest likelihood was consistent with monophyletic relationships of the recognized nr families. nodes for nr families 1- <dig> were each supported by high bootstrap scores . although nr families  <dig> and  <dig> were each weakly supported , a clade grouping these two families was fairly well supported  as previously shown by thornton  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses using just the dbd or portion of the lbd resulted in more poorly supported nodes throughout the tree and in some cases failed to recover monophyletic nr families . in addition, a complementary analysis using neighbor joining with the dbd and lbd also resulted in weakly supported nodes for the nr families . therefore, we inferred the phylogenetic relationships of the n. vectensis nrs from the likelihood analysis based on the dbd plus lbd.

nvnr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cannot be unambiguously assigned to a family and nest as equally related to nr families  <dig> and  <dig>  a majority of n. vectensis nrs  are strongly supported as homologs of genes in nr family  <dig>  these n. vectensis nrs are associated with four subfamilies within family  <dig>  nvnr <dig> is an ortholog of hnf <dig> , which has also been identified in vertebrates, insects, and nematodes  <cit> . nvnr5- <dig> cluster with subfamily 2e . nvnr <dig> and  <dig> are most closely related to tll with moderate bootstrap support. nvnr7- <dig> do not have a clear orthologs with the bilaterian genes from this subfamily and thus may represent a cnidarian-specific radiation. nvnr10- <dig> group with subfamily 2f , and among these, nvnr <dig> is most closely related to the bilaterian coup-tfs. nvnr15- <dig> are supported as homologs of the testicular orphan receptors . an rxr homolog  has been identified in the box jelly tripedalia cystophora  <cit> , but an rxr homolog is not apparent in the n. vectensis genome. nvnr <dig> groups with nr family  <dig>  but with relatively weak support. in the neighbor joining analysis, nvnr <dig> was positioned as an outgroup to nr families  <dig> and  <dig> but with low bootstrap support. a gcnf-like gene has not been previously reported from a cnidarian.

gene structure
n. vectensis nrs are composed of between  <dig> and  <dig> exons and span  <dig> to  <dig> bp of genomic sequence . because we currently have complete transcript sequence with 5- and 3- prime untranslated region  for fewer than half of the nrs , additional exons may be identified when complete transcripts are confirmed. in some cases , exons were composed completely of utr sequence; thus it is likely that additional exons will be identified for some of the nrs with uncharacterized utr sequence.

phylogenetic analyses indicated that several nrs in n. vectensis are most closely related to one another suggesting potential lineage-specific duplication. with the exception of two genes , the nrs in n. vectensis are located on different scaffolds. thus, the nr diversity in n. vectensis does not appear to have resulted from recent tandem duplications, but instead may represent more ancient duplications within the cnidarian lineage. some closely related genes also shared conserved intron-exon structure . for example, nvnr <dig> and nvnr <dig> group together with 100% bootstrap support and share two of three splice sites.

developmental expression of nuclear receptors
one-way anova indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nrs varied significantly in their level of expression during development . even with relatively coarse developmental staging, we observed clear temporal patterns of gene expression . nvnr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were primarily expressed during embryonic and/or early larval stages with little expression in the juvenile and adult stages. nvnr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were most highly expressed during larval and juvenile stages. nvnr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed increased expression during larval and juvenile stages and continued high expression in adults. finally, nvnr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were primarily expressed in adults, and nvnr <dig> was only minimally expressed in earlier stages. 18s expression did not vary significantly across the stages and is apparently a good housekeeping gene with respect to n. vectensis development. we also tested gapdh as a potential control gene to standardize gene expression. gapdh expression was highly variable across these developmental stages and was not used for comparisons of nr expression among stages.

absolute levels of gene expression, normalized to plasmid standards, indicated large differences in number of expressed transcripts among genes . although its expression was developmentally variable , nvnr <dig> was the most highly expressed nr over all stages . nvnr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> also showed high levels of overall expression.

in several cases, phylogenetically closely related genes showed divergent temporal expression patterns during development. for example, nr <dig> was expressed at very low levels , primarily during embryonic and early larval stages . in contrast, nr <dig> was expressed at moderate levels, mostly in adults.

principal components analysis  is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset, in this case facilitating identification of nrs with similar expression patterns. pca was conducted for all  <dig> genes from all developmental stages . the first principal component  accounted for 39% of the overall variance in gene expression and second principal component  accounted for 36% of the variance. when the values for pc <dig> and pc <dig> are shown on a scatter plot , three clusters emerged, nvnr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clustered to the exclusion of other genes along pc <dig> and were each highly expressed in early developmental stages . a second cluster contained nvnr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which are most strongly expressed in adults. the remaining genes constituted a third cluster and were not strongly distinguished from one another by this analysis.

discussion
cnidarians both occupy a key evolutionary position and are ecologically important as predators, prey and structure-builders in marine and freshwater environments. as "basal" metazoans, cnidarians form an outgroup to the bilaterian animals and are intermediate in complexity between sponges and bilaterians. in spite of the acknowledged importance of understanding cnidarians from both an ecological and an evolutionary perspective, cnidarian physiology is poorly understood, particularly at the molecular level. thus, characterizing cnidarian nrs provides insight both into evolution of nr signaling and bioregulatory processes in a major group of aquatic animals.

homology and expression of nvnrs
analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among nrs from the starlet sea anemone, nematostella vectensis, provides strong support for the diversification of nr family  <dig> prior to the divergence of the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages. phylogenetic analyses of n. vectensis and bilaterian nrs revealed cnidarian orthologs of hnf <dig>  coup, tll, and tr2/ <dig>  grasso et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> nrs in the coral acropora millepora, including several members of nr family  <dig>  our results support their conclusion that family  <dig> was well diversified prior to the split between the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages.

nvnr <dig> is an apparent homolog of hepatocyte nuclear factor  <dig> , which has also been identified in vertebrates, insects, nematodes, and corals  <cit> . in mammals, hnf4α binds endogenous fatty acid ligands  <cit>  and regulates hepatocyte differentiation, energetic metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification. hnf <dig> also regulates insect gut development  <cit> . hnf <dig> underwent extensive duplications in c. elegans  <cit>  such that inferring homologous functions for hnf <dig> from the nematode is difficult. one c. elegans paralog, nhr- <dig>  is involved in energetic metabolism as a regulator of fat storage  <cit> . in addition, an hnf <dig> homolog has been cloned from sponges and may be similar to the ancestral nr  <cit> . sponge hnf <dig> is expressed throughout development in ciliated column cells of the outer epithelium  <cit> . in n. vectensis, nvnr <dig> was expressed at all developmental time points with higher mean expression from larval to adult stages. we predict that nvnr <dig> will be expressed in endodermal tissue, which would be consistent with conserved roles in development of the digestive epithelium, energetic metabolism, and/or detoxification.

nvnr5- nvnr <dig> cluster with subfamily 2e ; members of this subfamily have previously been reported in corals  <cit> . in our phylogenetic analyses, we were unable to fully resolve the evolutionary relationships of n. vectensis and bilaterian nrs within subfamily 2e . in other animals, members of subfamily 2e are involved in neural differentiation. tailless homologs in mammals  and insects  are particularly important for eye and forebrain development  <cit>  and embryonic anterior-posterior patterning  <cit> . fax- <dig> regulates neural patterning in c. elegans  <cit> , and pnr plays a more specialized role by regulating retinal development in vertebrates  <cit> . several n. vectensis members of subfamily 2e  were highly expressed during early developmental stages coinciding with neurogenesis and embryonic patterning  <cit> . the stage of maximal expression varied among members of this subfamily, indicating potential diversification of function within the cnidarian lineage.

nvnr10-nvnr <dig> group with subfamily 2f ; coup-tfs have also been identified in corals, hydra, flatworms, sea urchin, and lancelets  <cit> . nvnr <dig> was most closely related to bilaterian coup-tfs, while nvnr11- nvnr <dig> are supported as an independent radiation with this subfamily. coup-tfs generally act as transcriptional repressors and regulate development of muscles, the heart and the nervous system, particularly differentiation of the hindbrain and photoreceptors  <cit> . in hydra, coup-tf is expressed in nematoblasts  and in a subset of neuronal cells, consistent with a conserved role of coup-tf in regulating neural differentiation  <cit> . coup-tfs can also affect reproductive processes through cross-talk with estrogen receptors and ecdysteroid receptors in vertebrates and insects, respectively  <cit> . coup-tf homologs from n. vectensis showed diverse expression patterns during development. for example, nvnr <dig> and <dig> were primarily expressed during embryonic and/or early larval stages with little expression in the juvenile and adult stages. the expression of these coup-tf-like genes coincides with neurogenesis and embryo patterning  <cit> . in contrast, we observed relatively high expression of nvnr <dig> in adults but lower expression during embryogenesis and larval development.

we identified two members of the subfamily 2c/d . tr2/ <dig> homologs have been identified in a range of animals including vertebrates, sea urchins, ascidians, nematodes, insects, flatworms, and corals  <cit> . protostomes and most deuterostomes have a single tr2/ <dig> homolog. interestingly, both n. vectensis and the coral acropora millepora  <cit>  contain two tr2/ <dig> homologs, suggesting a cnidarian-specific duplication. in general, tr2/ <dig> homologs act as transcriptional repressors through several mechanisms including competition with other nuclear receptors for binding sites and co-factors  <cit> . tr2/ <dig> homologs are broadly expressed in vertebrate tissues  <cit>  and throughout development in mammals  <cit> , ascidians  <cit> , and flatworms  <cit> . we observed similar ubiquitous expression in n. vectensis where both nvnr <dig> and  <dig> were expressed throughout all developmental stages.

nvnr <dig> forms a monophyletic grouping with nr family  <dig> . although bootstrap support for this assignment is relatively weak, likelihood analyses of the dbd plus lbd and each of these domains individually group nvnr <dig> as a homolog to the gcnfs. while neighbor joining analysis placed nvnr <dig> as an outgroup to nr families  <dig> and  <dig>  bootstrap support for deep nodes of this tree were low relative to the maximum likelihood analyses, potentially obscuring evolutionary relationships. gcnf has been reported from a number of bilaterian phyla. this is the first report of a putative cnidarian homolog from this nr family. expression of gcnf homologs varies greatly among taxa. in d. melanogaster, dmhr <dig> is expressed following pulses of 20-hydroxyecdysone during discrete stages of embryogenesis, the second larval instar and prepupal development  <cit> . in c. elegans, cenhr- <dig> is expressed in response to atp-binding cassette protein e in embryos, larvae and several adult tissues  <cit> . in vertebrates, gcnf is expressed primarily expressed in gonadal tissues and during embryogenesis  <cit> . in vertebrates, gcnf is involved in neuronal differentiation, germ cell development, and axial patterning, and gametogenesis  <cit> . in our study, nvnr <dig> expression increased throughout the sampled developmental stages. highest expression was in adult tissues, which may reflect a role in gametogenesis.

nvnr1- <dig> did not group well with any previously defined nr family. these genes are most closely related to nr family  <dig> and  <dig>  with the available data, we cannot conclude whether these represent the descendents of ancient nrs that later diversified into recognized nr families or if these genes represent an independent radiation somewhere within the cnidarian lineage. further sampling within the cnidaria will be necessary to help resolve the evolutionary relationship of these nrs.

we did not identify a member of nr family  <dig> in n. vectensis. nr family  <dig> is represented in protostomes and deuterostomes  <cit> , and has been more recently identified in the placozoan trichoplax adhaerens  but has not yet been reported from any cnidarian. thus, nr  <dig> homologs have apparently been lost early in the cnidarian lineage. nr family  <dig> contains the vertebrate-type steroid  receptors. while nr <dig> family members were not identified in n. vectensis, estrogens and other steroids have been detected in cnidarian tissues  <cit> , are apparently released during spawning events  <cit> , and can experimentally affect coral growth and reproduction  <cit> . the mechanism for steroid action in cnidarians is currently unknown and may be mediated through nuclear receptors that are not orthologs of the vertebrate steroid receptors or through alternative mechanisms.

rxr loss in n. vectensis
n. vectensis appears to have lost the ortholog of rxr because this gene is present in another cnidarian, the cubozoan tripedalia cystophora  <cit> . the rxr homolog  from t. cystophora bound 9-cis retinoic acid, and heterodimerized with vertebrate thyroid hormone receptor  <cit> . this evidence suggests that this cnidarian rxr functions in a similar way as vertebrate rxrs. in contrast to the box jelly, an rxr ortholog was not identified in a pcr-based survey of nrs from the coral acropora millepora  <cit> . however, rxr immunoreactivity has been reported in epithelial nerve tissue of the coral a. millepora and the sea pansy renilla koellikeri, but the genes were not identified  <cit> . indeed the authors of the immunological study indicated that the epitope for the antibody has highest sequence similarity to a. millepora nuclear receptor  <dig>  but phylogenetic analyses indicate that amnr <dig> is most similar to tr2/ <dig>  <cit> . the absence of an rxr ortholog in n. vectensis and in corals is particularly interesting from a functional perspective because vertebrate and insect rxrs form heterodimers with many other nuclear receptors to regulate gene expression  <cit> . in a parallel example, c. elegans independently lost an rxr ortholog, but another nr  can dimerize with several other nrs  <cit> . thus, it has been suggested that nhr- <dig> may have assumed an rxr-like function as a common heterodimerization partner  <cit> . similarly, n. vectensis and other cnidarians may have one or more receptors that "promiscuously" form heterodimers with other nrs in a manner similar to bilaterian rxrs. alternatively, it is possible that rxr has been lost and not replaced with a functional equivalent.

gene duplication and divergence
within nr family  <dig>  our data from n. vectensis support independent radiations of several subfamilies. phylogenetic analyses support two tr2/ <dig> genes and multiple coup-tf-like nrs in n. vectensis. similarly, we observed  <dig> n. vectensis nrs that group with bilaterian nrs in the subfamily nr 2e. these genes are likely cnidarian-specific radiations within these nr  <dig> subfamilies and may represent interesting cases for better understanding the diversification of nr function within an early diverging metazoan.

after gene duplications, paralogs may be selected for divergent functions that may be reflected by different expression patterns  <cit> . previous reports of n. vectensis paralogs have suggested that duplicated genes have varying degrees of distinct spatial and temporal gene expression patterns . in some cases, nvnrs supported as likely lineage specific duplications showed divergent temporal gene expression patterns consistent with subfunctionalization. for example, nvnr <dig> was highly expressed in the larval and juvenile stages, and the closely related nvnr <dig> was most highly expressed during cleavage and in adults. in situ hybridization studies of n. vectensis will reveal spatial expression patterns , providing further insight into the potential subfuctionalization of duplicated nrs.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have identified  <dig> nuclear receptors in the sea anemone nematostella vectensis. phylogenetic analyses indicate that a majority of these nrs are members of nr family  <dig> and are consistent with previous studies indicating that this family had diversified prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian split. we also identified a putative homolog to gcnf in nr family  <dig> as well as three nrs that do not group with any previously identified nr family. expression of n. vectensis nrs varied during development, consistent with stage-specific functions related to development, metamorphosis and adult physiology. future studies of nr function in n. vectensis will provide a critical understanding of the evolution the nuclear receptor superfamily in animals.
