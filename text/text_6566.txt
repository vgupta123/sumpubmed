BACKGROUND
dna sequence periodicity with the period about 10– <dig> base pairs  has been long known in eukaryotic dna sequences. it was discovered recently in prokaryotic sequences as well  <cit> . the periodicity in eubacteria sequences usually shows the period close to  <dig> bp  <cit> . this period is clearly different from the structural helical period of  <dig> – <dig>  bp/turn  <cit> . the difference was interpreted  <cit>  as a possible reflection of the sequence dependent writhe of prokaryotic dna. in the work  <cit>  it was demonstrated that the periodicity in the bacterial genomes, in e. coli as well, is distributed in a non-uniform way, in scattered segments of the size 100– <dig> bases. it was also known for a long time that quite a few dna promoter regions of e. coli possess the sequence periodicity of aa and tt dinucleotides  <cit> .

the sequence periodicity of aa/tt dinucleotides is frequently associated with sequence-dependent dna curvature, which is known to play an important role in the initiation of transcription of many genes . using different models and approaches for prediction of intrinsic dna curvature it was shown that many e. coli promoters have upstream curved sequences  <cit> . pedersen et al.  <cit>  showed that promoter area frequently has an unusual sequence structure. this region possesses higher dna curvature, more rigid and less stable. moreover, in our study of prokaryotic terminators of transcription  we have found that in e. coli dna curvature peaks are frequently located downstream of the cds.

since the dinucleotide periodicity with the period close to the helical repeat is associated with dna intrinsic curvature  <cit> , the curvature distribution along dna would suggest similar distribution of dna sequence periodicity.

in this work, the sequence dinucleotide periodicity in e. coli and its distribution along the genome are systematically analyzed. a strong preference of intergenic regions to express the sequence periodicity of aa, ac, gc, and tt dinucleotides is discovered.

RESULTS
positional autocorrelation analysis of the nucleotide sequences is an appropriate tool to detect all major characteristic distances in the sequences, the periodicities in particular. the complete genome of e. coli, as well as its coding and noncoding regions, was subjected to this procedure. resulting autocorrelation profiles for all  <dig> dinucleotides  were further analyzed by fourier transform. in fig.  <dig> the corresponding spectra are shown. the analysis demonstrates presence of the sequence periodicity of aa and tt dinucleotides with a period close to  <dig> bp mostly in intergenic regions, and weaker periodicity of ac and gc notably exclusively in intergenic regions. all  <dig> dinucleotides show periodicity of  <dig> bp, a well-known characteristics of the coding sequences, e.g.  <cit> . weak  <dig> bp periodicity of at and ta is also observed in intergenic regions. it indicates, perhaps, presence of tandem apt repeats. a weak  <dig> bp periodicity of gc in intergenic regions, probably, corresponds to terminator regions . the amplitudes of the  <dig> bp periodicity of aa and tt are the highest, even comparable with  <dig> bp coding periodicity. we, thus, focused on aa and tt distributions.

to screen the genome of e. coli and find out where the periodical regions are located, we chose the period  <dig>  bp  <cit>  and this study ; and the window of  <dig> bp  <cit> . we used periodical aa and tt probes with the above periodicity to correlate with the e. coli genome sequence and to detect the periodical sites. this calculation shows that the periodicity is not evenly distributed along the e. coli genome.

in fig.  <dig>  the typical maps for several large segments of the e. coli genome are shown. the periodicity is distinctly located in certain regions. many of the peaks observed are found to correspond to the intergenic regions . for example, two such peaks of periodicity in fig. 2a correspond to the intergenic regions. three such maxima are observed in fig. 2b, three in fig. 2c, and two in fig. 2d. for the genome sections in fig.  <dig> about 2/ <dig> of the intergenic regions are associated with the local periodicity.

to verify the apparent strong correlation between the intergenic regions and aa/tt periodicity, we split intergenic regions in several families by size and analyzed the subsets separately by aligning  the regions and summing up the respective local periodicity distributions. the combined maps for intergenic regions with a size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and from  <dig> to  <dig> bp are shown in fig.  <dig>  this figure demonstrates, indeed, that intergenic regions are typically periodic, irrespective of the size. the average amplitudes of the observed periodicities –  <dig> – <dig>  units – are comparable with the amplitudes in fig.  <dig>  which indicates that, indeed a large proportion of the intergenic regions are periodical.

to verify the choice of the period  <dig>  bases, we calculated the periodicity maps for highly populated group of the regions of the size  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, by assuming different periods in the range  <dig> – <dig>  bases. the resonance 3d plot in fig.  <dig> indicates that the best-fit period is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bp, which confirms earlier estimates of the e. coli dna sequence periodicity.

the spectral analysis  and examples of the periodicity distribution maps  show that apart from described correlation among the intergenic regions and aa/tt periodicity, there are numerous sites of periodicity located within coding sequences. work is in progress to find out the functional relevance, if any, of these sites.

CONCLUSIONS
the observed concentration of the sequence periodicity in the intergenic regions corroborates earlier results and suggests that the periodicity is a typical property of the intergenic regions.
