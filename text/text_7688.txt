BACKGROUND
during recent decades, global warming and climate change have been important topics in modern biology. the world’s average temperature, atmospheric co <dig> concentration, and tropospheric ozone concentration  are increasing, thus leading to climatic extremes  <cit> . high temperature exposure results in reduced plant growth and productivity, including broccoli, tomato and wheat . broccoli, brassica oleracea l. var italica, is an important vegetable crop containing multiple nutrients and anti-cancer phytochemicals such as glucoraphanin and its derivative sulforaphane  <cit> . floral heads of broccoli are harvested at an average daily temperature below 22 °c. broccoli head is characterized by a fused inflorescence of several arrested floral spikes with proliferation of almost fully developed floral buds. the head formation of broccoli is sensitive to and irreversible with high temperature, so the yield and quality of the crop decreases  <cit> . heat stress is limiting for the production of vegetable crops in many areas of the world. therefore, the investigation of molecular mechanisms into heat-tolerant head-forming capacity in broccoli can help decipher the biological basis of the response to heat and the selection of broccoli with improved heat tolerance.

the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase during plant development is strictly intermingled in response to environmental and endogenous cues  <cit> . temperature and photoperiod are the two major environmental cues that influence i) duration of juvenile period , ii) those for floral initiation, iii) for development of floral primordia, iv) inflorescence organ identity and v) final floral development . the acceleration of flowering by prolonged exposure to low temperature is called vernalization. without environmental signals, endogenous cues include the developmental or autonomous pathway that still can modulate flowering time  <cit> . leaf primordia derive from the peripheral zone of the shoot apical meristem  during the vegetative phase. then, cauline leaf primordia subtend axillary inflorescence meristems in the early reproductive phase and the floral primordia form a bractless flower during the late reproductive phase  <cit> . molecular genetic analyses have revealed that flowering locus c  is a major flowering repressor in the autonomous and vernalization pathways regulating flowering time in arabidopsis. expressing flc from the phloem or sam strongly inhibits both flowering locus t  and suppressor of overexpression of constans <dig>  expression by directly binding to their regulatory regions. ft and soc <dig> activate the specification of floral organ identity genes, such as cauliflower  and apetala <dig>  that are required for flower formation in the meristem  <cit> . despite a highly conserved molecular mechanism for the precise orchestration of flowering time, species-specific differences exist in signal perception, transduction and integration in flowering time pathways  <cit> . further open questions are how these networks evolved and the topology of the gene networks in different species.

endogenous small non-coding rnas are of four groups -- micrornas , trans-acting small interfering rnas, natural antisense transcripts sirnas, and repeat-associated sirnas -- and are implicated in the plant response to abiotic stress  <cit> . plant mirnas are 20–to 24–nt single-stranded rnas and are processed from stem-loop precursors by the ribonuclease iii dicer-like i  and its interacting partner, the rna binding protein hyponastic leaves <dig>   <cit> . mirnas negatively regulate the gene expression of target mrnas at the nearly perfect base complementarity via endonucleolytic cleavage or translational inhibition at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . evidence indicates that mirnas have various functions during plant development in response to environmental signals and are essential and effective regulators . in one of the pioneering studies, mir <dig> was found to target squamosa promoter binding protein like  <dig> , and mir172b was found to target apetala2-like  transcription factors  to regulate the temporal coordination of vegetative phase change and floral induction  <cit> . genome-wide analysis of mirnas showed that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are induced by heat stress in wheat  <cit> . many mirna-target genes were discovered, and the identification of lower-level non-conserved mirnas was feasible by high-throughput degradome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis in various species .

in all,  <dig> mirnas have been identified in brassicaceae, including arabidopsis thaliana, brassica napus and brassica rapa, and are deposited in the mirna database mirbase   <cit> . one of these mirnas, mir <dig>  induced at early embryonic developmental stages in seeds, could target spl family genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . overall,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified by deep sequencing  technology; bra-mir <dig> and bra-mir <dig> were found to be up-regulated and bra-mir <dig> and bra-mir1885b. <dig> down-regulated under heat stress in b. rapa. the predicted target of bra-mir1885b. <dig> is involved in the regulation of plant heat tolerance  <cit> . a total of  <dig> potential mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were predicted by computational analysis of brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis  <cit> . many predicted mirna targets encode transcription factors that play vital roles in plant development. for example, the mir <dig> family is the largest family of mirnas and has  <dig> potential target genes including dre-binding transcription factor, nac-domain protein, and wrky transcription factors  <cit> . although hundreds of plant mirnas have been identified, only  <dig> conserved mirna families were reported in b. oleracea by experimental or computational studies  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated the importance of temperature requirements for flowering in brassica plant species  <cit> . however, the regulatory roles of broccoli mirnas with changed expression profiles during head formation in response to heat stress have yet to be thoroughly explored.

in this study, the broccoli inbred lines that are capable of undergoing floral initiation to produce head at high temperature are unique varieties in taiwan. the head-forming capacity at high temperature of the desired traits is developed through natural selection followed by conventional breeding programs  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the head-forming capacity at high temperature in broccoli remain to be elusive. it is important to identify novel mirnas and uncovered differently expressed mirnas in two representative broccoli genotypes to deduce the molecular regulation underlying head-forming capacity at high temperature. two comprehensive small rna  libraries from the two broccoli genotypes were constructed by a deep sequencing approach. one broccoli genotype exhibited heat-tolerant head-forming capacity  and the other line is heat-sensitive . overall,  <dig> , <dig> total sequence reads representing  <dig> , <dig> unique srnas were sequenced, and most were  <dig> to 24 nt in length. from sequencing library information and bioinformatics analysis,  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas with significantly differential expression between the ht and hs genotypes were discovered. the potential targets of the differentially expressed mirnas were predominantly involved in development, response to oxidative stress, and energy metabolism. here the regulatory interactions between mirnas and their target genes provide new insights into mirnas in broccoli associated with heat-tolerant head-forming capacity.

RESULTS
head-forming capacity changes under different temperature in two broccoli genotypes
to understand the relationship between head-forming capacity and temperature in two ht and hs broccoli genotypes, the genotypes were grown under different temperatures under long-day conditions. the temperature treatment was applied to plants at 40 days post-germination  . ht and hs genotypes showed similar head-forming capacity at 15 °c at  <dig> dpg . the head of ht genotype continued to produce completely opened flower as compared with clusters of tight green flower buds of hs at  <dig> dpg . both ht and hs genotypes exhibited head-forming capacity at 15 °c, but only the ht genotype showed head-forming capacity at 22 °c and 27 °c at  <dig> dpg . leaf numbers at head formation were lower in the ht than hs line at 22 °c at  <dig> dpg . the hs line failed to produce heads at 22 °c throughout cultivation.fig.  <dig> differential heat tolerance of two broccoli lines. a head-forming capacity of heat-tolerant 'b295'  and heat-sensitive 'br <dig> op'  broccoli  under different temperatures  at 130 days post-germination . scale bars = 1 cm. b head-forming capacity of ht and hs genotypes under 15 °c at  <dig> and  <dig> dpg, respectively. c total leaf number under long-day conditions at 22 °c 



overview of srna sequencing
to examine srnas linked to the regulation of head-forming capacity in the two genotypes, deep sequencing were used to construct two srna libraries from shoot apexes of the ht and hs genotypes at  <dig> dpg at 22 °c prior to head formation. the total sequence reads of  <dig>  million , on average, from each library were obtained after discarding the adapter and low-quality sequences . the mean number of unique reads in the two libraries was  <dig>  million . sequences were aligned to the collected brassica-related transcriptomic and genomic libraries. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % srna sequences, representing  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of unique sequences, respectively, were perfectly mapped for further computational analysis. about  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, of the unique sequences as known mirnas were identified, which account for  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, of the total srnas. srna reads that might be from known rrna, trna, small nuclear rna , and small nucleolar rna  were excluded. the remaining unique sequences  could be used to identify novel mirna candidates.table  <dig> different categories of small rnas from ht and hs broccoli under heat stress

srnas showed wide variation in length, from  <dig> to 30 nt , with three major peaks at 21–, 23–, and 24-nt in the redundant sequence reads . in the two libraries, the major classes of total srnas were 24 nt:  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. the 24-nt srnas were also predominant in the non-redundant sequences, implying that the srnas sequences are diverse in broccoli .fig.  <dig> length distribution of redundant  and non-redundant  small rna sequences. data from shoot apexes of ht and hs broccoli. ht: heat-tolerant broccoli, hs: heat-sensitive broccoli, nt, nucleotides



known mirnas in broccoli
use of computational algorithms revealed  <dig> known mirnas belong to  <dig> families with an average of about three mirna members per family . the size distribution of known mirnas were mostly 21 nt . a total of  <dig> corresponding mirna* sequences for known mirnas were detected . although most were present at a very low expression, the abundance was higher for some mirnas* than their corresponding mirnas. in particular, the expression of mir398b* was greater by  <dig> -fold that of mir398b in the ht library in transcripts per million . an advantage of deep sequencing is the ability to determine individual members within a mirna family. in general, the solexa sequencing results showed similar expression of members in the same family, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig> families. the sequencing analysis also revealed varied expression of some members in certain families . in the ht library, the expression of the mir <dig> family ranged from  <dig>  tpm  to  <dig>  tpm  and that of the mir <dig> family from  <dig>  tpm  to  <dig>  tpm . in addition, mir164a was more highly expressed than other members of the mir <dig> family in both the ht and hs libraries.

expression profiling of known mirnas
to determine which mirnas correlated with the heat-tolerant head-forming capacity, the expression of mirnas in the ht and hs lines were compared. there were  <dig> differentially expressed known mirnas in the ht and hs libraries . in the ht genotype, the expression of mir156/mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were significantly up-regulated, whereas that of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> was down-regulated as compared with the hs genotype. most of the mirnas showed greater expression in the ht than hs genotype. the differential expression profiles of these mirnas in the two genotypes may contribute to heat-tolerant head-forming capacity.table  <dig> differentially expressed known mirnas in shoot apexes between ht and hs broccoli under heat stress

newly identified mirnas in the libraries of ht and hs genotypes
novel mirna candidates were selected on the basis of the secondary structure of precursor sequences, the mirna/mirna* duplex and the minimal folding free energy  value. using their precursor sequences, their stem-loop hairpin secondary structures were predicted. most of novel mirnas are located in the 5′ arm of the hairpin structure. to identify the novel mirnas associated with heat-tolerant head-forming capacity, the fold-change in expression of novel mirna candidates were analyzed between the ht and hs genotypes. a total of  <dig> novel mirna candidates showed significant differential expression between the ht and hs genotypes  . the mean of mfe was– <dig>  kcal/mol  . five novel mirna candidates displayed well-formed secondary structures with lower mfe values were considered potential candidates for further study . search of corresponding mirna* sequences showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirna candidates were expressed in the libraries. the rest of corresponding mirna* sequences may be hardly found due to their quick degradation or particular spatial/temporal expression pattern. these novel mirna candidates were inspected in mirna sequences of other plants for orthologs or homologs, but there was no match in other plant species, which suggests that they are novel and broccoli-specific mirnas . the expression of novel- <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher in the hs than ht genotype. however, the expression of novel- <dig> and novel- <dig> was  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, higher in the ht than hs genotype. this is inconsistent with previous observation that novel mirnas are usually expressed at lower levels, assuming that some novel mirnas accumulate only in a conditional restricted manner.table  <dig> differentially expressed novel mirnas in shoot apexes between ht and hs broccoli under heat stress

prediction of different expression of mirna targets in ht and hs
to investigate the biological functions of the known broccoli mirnas, putative targets of these mirnas differentially expressed between the ht and hs genotypes were predicted by using psrnatarget  <cit> . of the  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families,  <dig> unique potential targets were identified . the potential target transcripts were used for a blastn search against the arabidopsis transcript database to identify their homologs in arabidopsis. a high proportion of mirna targets belonged to transcription factors, including those encoding squamosa promoter binding protein , nuclear transcription factor y alpha , the ap2/erf domain protein  and the mads-box transcription factor   <cit> . on analysis of  <dig> novel mirnas with differential expression between the two genotypes,  <dig> potential target genes were predicted . unlike the conserved mirnas, the targets of novel broccoli mirnas were mainly related to transporter activity, kinase activity, and energy pathways. the novel mirnas may be responsible for regulating diverse biological processes, including developmental processes, signaling transduction pathways and energy metabolic pathways.table  <dig> potential targets of differentially expressed novel mirnas between ht and hs broccoli under heat stress



experimental validation of mirna-mediated cleavage of their corresponding target mrnas
we performed rlm 5′-race experiment to verify the cleavage sites of the mirna-mediated target genes. as expected, the transcripts of toe <dig> and aps <dig> were mostly cleaved in the regions complementary with mir172d and mir395a. in case of toe <dig> , mostly were detected to be cleaved between 11– <dig> bases relative to the 5′ end of the mirna. similar to cleavage of aps <dig>   <dig> among  <dig> sequenced clones had a cleavage site between 11– <dig> nucleotide . four cleavage sites of jmj <dig> were located at 1– <dig>  14– <dig>  4– <dig> downstream or 7– <dig> downstream from the bol-novel- <dig> complementary region.fig.  <dig> mapping of target mrna cleavage sites by rlm 5′-race. the cleavage sites are indicated by vertical arrows and the numbers refer to the ratio of the total number of clones sequenced



validation of the expression levels of broccoli mirnas
to confirm the expression profiles of mirnas obtained from solexa sequencing,  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas were chosen to analyze their expression using stem-loop semi-quantitative pcr  and stem-loop qrt-pcr . these mirnas were selected based on the following reasons:  they were high sequencing counts in either ht or hs lines, or  they displayed significantly expression differences between ht and hs lines. these potential novel mirnas were further confirmed by stem-loop rt-pcr . the expression pattern of the validated mirnas by stem-loop qrt-pcr was mostly in agreement with by the sequencing data . overall, these data demonstrated that deep sequencing was a reliable method for detecting and measuring the expression profiles of mirnas. however, bol-novel- <dig>  and bol-novel- <dig> displayed different expression patterns by qrt-pcr and sequencing data . the discrepancy may be due to  the difference in sensitivity of different fluorescent dyes and methods, or  the cloning preferences in deep sequencing  <cit> . additionally, we confirmed the expression levels of their corresponding targets by qrt-pcr . in most of the cases, the inverse expression patterns of mirnas and their targets have been observed and this is in accordance with the cleavage of target mrnas mediated by mirnas. the transcript levels of spl <dig> and toe <dig> were negatively correlated with the accumulation of mir156b and mir172d, respectively. the abundance of cat <dig> and arf <dig> transcripts increased with the down-regulation of mir827* and bol-novel- <dig>  respectively. contrarily, the expression of nf-ya <dig>  aps <dig>  and paps showed a modest increase while the transcript levels of mir169f, mir395a, bol-novel- <dig> and bol-novel- <dig> were up-regulated. the transcripts of jmj <dig> and phb were up-regulated, whereas the expression of bol-novel- <dig> and bol-novel- <dig> remained constant.fig.  <dig> expression validation of the selected known and novel mirnas and their putative target genes from shoot apexes of ht and hs broccoli under heat stress. a and  stem-loop qrt-pcr or rt-pcr showing relative expression of the selected mirnas. u <dig> was used as a loading control . c qrt-pcr analysis of their putative target genes. 18s rrna was used as an internal control. asterisks denote significant differences from the ht 



gene ontology of mirna target genes between the ht and hs lines
these targets from known and novel mirnas with differential expression between the ht and hs genotypes were further categorized using agrigo analysis  <cit> . significant go terms were related to post-embryonic development, nitrogen compound metabolic process, reproductive developmental process, response to temperature stimulus, and transcription  . for biological process,  <dig> genes were assigned to  <dig> different categories. the target genes encoding transcription factors such as ap <dig>  toe <dig>  toe <dig> and spl were implicated in the reproductive developmental process . in addition, the target genes associated with response to temperature stimulus were enriched. thus, the expression profiles of differentially expressed mirnas and their targets may contribute to heat-tolerant head-forming capacity in broccoli.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  classification of the predicted target genes of differentially expressed mirnas between ht and hs broccoli during heat treatment. percentage of mirna target genes mapped to the go term against the input genes. the background/reference list is the percentage of total annotated reference genes mapping to go terms



expression of floral regulatory and heat shock protein genes between the ht and hs lines
to further address the mirna-mediated regulation of floral initiation underlying head-forming capacity in the two genotypes at various temperatures, the mrna expression of the floral regulators bo-ft , bo-flc <dig> , and bo-ap <dig>  at  <dig> dpg before head formation were analyzed. at 15 °c, bo-ft was expressed in both ht and hs genotypes. at 22 °c and 27 °c, the expression of bo-ft was predominately expressed in the ht rather than hs genotype. in contrast, the expression of bo-flc <dig> was higher in the hs than ht genotype at 15 °c, 22 °c and 27 °c. bo-ap <dig> was weakly expressed in both genotypes at all temperatures at  <dig> dpg . the expression level of bo-ap <dig> was induced in the ht genotype at 15 °c at  <dig> dpg . to further explore the temporal expression pattern of floral identity genes in the two genotypes at 22 °c, bo-ap <dig> and bo-cal expression were detected at different times. at  <dig> dpg, no bo-ap <dig> or bo-cal transcripts were detected in either genotype. at  <dig> and  <dig> dpg, bo-ap <dig> and bo-cal transcript levels were higher in the ht than hs genotype . from molecular analysis of floral regulators, the ht genotype underwent floral initiation at  <dig> dpg at 22 °c . subsequently, the head in ht was developed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpg.fig.  <dig> comparison of floral regulatory and heat shock protein gene expression between the ht and hs lines. a rt-pcr analysis of mrna expression of flowering-time control genes  and heat stress-responsive genes  under different temperatures at  <dig> dpg. 18s rrna was used as an internal control. b floral meristem identity genes  after  <dig> dpg at 15 °c. c floral meristem identity genes  after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpg at 22 °c. d microarray heatmap of genes encoding plant heat shock proteins, including hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> gene family. the cdna sequences encoding proteins were annotated on the basis of arabidopsis genes in tair . the black box indicates the difference in expression level between ht and hs at 22 °c. the log <dig> expression values derived from  <dig> biological replications corresponding to each sample were shown



we also examined the effects of elevated temperatures on transcript levels of heat stress-responsive genes, bo-hsp <dig> and bo-hsp <dig>  in the two genotypes. the expression level of bo-hsp <dig> was higher in the hs than ht genotype at 22 °c . similarly, the bo-hsp <dig> transcript level was slightly induced in the hs line, but not in the ht genotype at 22 °c . microarray expression profile analysis of hsp-related genes also showed higher transcript level of hsps in hs than that of ht at 22 °c . expression level of bo-hsp <dig> and bo-hsp <dig> in hs genotype was 10- and 2-fold higher than those of ht, respectively . on the basis of the expression of hsp genes, it is suggested that ht was less sensitive to high temperature  than hs. taken together, the head-forming capacity at high temperature of the unique ht line  was correlated with less sensitivity to heat stress as well as autonomous regulation of bo-ft and bo-flc <dig> genes .

genotypic variation in response to high temperature during head formation
to scrutinize the relationship of genotypic differences and head-forming capacity at high temperature, we obtained the other heat-tolerant ’avs1′ line  to test the head-forming capacity at 22 °c at  <dig> dpg. the ht <dig> line had a similar phenotype as the ht line with normal head formation under high temperature as compared with the hs line . the expression of bo-ft was significantly expressed in the ht <dig> rather than hs genotype . the expression of bo-flc <dig> was preferentially expressed in the hs than ht <dig> genotype. then, we examined the expression of the selected mirnas and their targets in comparison to ht <dig> and hs lines using stem-loop qrt-pcr. eight of these ten mirnas  shared the same expression patterns in response to high temperature in the ht <dig> and ht genotypes as compared with the hs genotype . the inverse relationship between mirnas  and their corresponding targets  expression profiles in the ht <dig> line was consistent with in the ht line. changes in mir169f, mir172d, and mir395a abundance did not have a negative effect on the abundance of nf-ya <dig>  toe <dig> and aps <dig> . it is suggested that enhanced head-forming capacity through the thermotolerance mechanisms could be attributed to genotype-specific expression of mirnas and their targets.fig.  <dig> genotypic variation and characterization of the heat-tolerant 'avs1'  and heat-sensitive 'br <dig> op'  genotypes in broccoli during head formation under heat stress. a different head-forming capacity of ht <dig> and hs lines after  <dig> dpg at 22 °c. scale bars = 1 cm. b semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of mrna expression of bo-ft and bo-flc <dig> after  <dig> dpg at 22 °c. 18s rrna was used as an internal control. c stem-loop qrt-pcr showing relative expression of the selected known and novel mirnas in comparison with ht <dig> and hs lines. u <dig> was used as a loading control. d comparison of the gene expression profiles of their mirna putative targets between ht <dig> and hs lines using qrt-pcr analysis. 18s rrna was used as an internal control. asterisks denote significant differences from the ht 



discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
several studies have provided strong evidence for a beneficial role of broccoli consumption against cancer  <cit> . however, global warming and climate changes have reduced broccoli crop yields worldwide  <cit> . the broccoli inbred lines  that are capable of producing head at high temperature  described in this study are unique varieties in taiwan. to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying head formation in broccoli under heat stress, deep sequencing to systematically characterize the mirnaomes in shoot apexes of ht and hs broccoli genotypes were used . go classification and functional analysis of predicted mirna targets resulted in main four subgroups related to transcription, temperature, hormones and energy metabolism . autonomous regulation of the bo-flc <dig> and bo-ft genes as well as less sensitivity to heat may contribute to floral initiation to produce broccoli heads in the unique ht line as compared to hs . the targets involved in phase change, sam activity, reproductive developmental process, cellular redox state, protein homeostasis, hormone signalling pathways and photosynthesis were enriched for heat-tolerant head-forming capacity .fig.  <dig> the potential functional network regulated by mirnas in the ht line of broccoli during head formation in response to heat stress



the targets of the first subgroup of mirnas are correlated with regulation of sam development, phase change from vegetative to the reproductive growth, and flowering time . with the exception of target of bol-novel- <dig> and bol-novel- <dig>  all of the first subgroup from the predicted target genes is transcription factor. broccoli mir <dig> was predicted to target seven spl transcription factors for the coordination of vegetative development and floral transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . the two predicted broccoli mir <dig> target genes were homologous to the arabidopopsis nf-ya <dig> and nf-ya <dig> transcription factors. the expression of mir <dig> was detected in sam. overexpression of nf-ya <dig> and nf-ya <dig> resulted in late flowering  <cit> . arabidopsis mir <dig> family target the atnf-ya transcription factor to represses atflc, allowing atft expression to induce flowering  <cit> . in this study, it is suggested that accumulation of mir <dig> in the ht genotype may in turn inhibit the expression of bo-flc <dig> gene expression . the putative targets of mir <dig> were four members of the apetala <dig> -like family of transcription factors, including ap <dig>  toe <dig>  toe <dig>  and schlafmÜtze   <cit> . the complex pleiotropy of ap <dig> functions in maintaining floral meristem size, determining floral organ identity, and affecting flowering time  <cit> . toe <dig> and toe <dig> are essential for the juvenile-to-adult transition, the vegetative-to-reproductive transition, and the regulation of flowering time, and the mir172/smz module is a flowering time regulator  <cit> . jung et al.  found 35s:156 × 35s: <dig> and 35s: <dig> transgenic plants exhibited early flowering, whereas 35s: <dig> transgenic plants were late flowering as compared with the wild type  <cit> . in addition, the early flowering phenotype of 35s: <dig> transgenic plants was temperature-insensitive  <cit> . it has been reported that downregulation of mir172-regulated ap2-like transcription factors enhanced the expression of ft. ft protein is transported to sam through phloem and stimulates flowering  <cit> . in this study, the expression of mir <dig> was up-regulated in the ht genotype as compared with the hs . the expression of bo-ft was predominately expressed in the ht rather than hs genotype at 22 °c . therefore, it is suggested that induction of mir <dig> in the ht genotype may negatively regulate ap <dig>  toes and smz, which in turn to induce floral integrator ft. modulation of mir <dig> expression may be a key regulation mechanism linking the thermosensory and flowering-time pathways for heat-tolerant head-forming capacity in broccoli. bol-novel- <dig> and bol-novel- <dig> target transcripts encoding canonical nuclear poly polymerase <dig>  paps <dig>  to extend poly tail at the 3′ end of pre-mrnas  <cit> . the metabolism of pre-mrna poly tail is a temperature-dependent process. we suggest that paps <dig> could mediate the formation of pre-mrna polyadenylation by altered expression of bol-novel- <dig> and bol-novel- <dig> to protect from heat damage  <cit> . the target of bol-novel- <dig> was predicted to be a jumonji-class transcription factor with h3k <dig> demethylase activity, jmj <dig>  jmj <dig> repressed the expression of flc by reducing the level of h3k <dig> methylation in flc chromatin to promote the expression of ft in companion cells to stimulate flowering  <cit> . phb, the hd-zip iii transcription factor gene, was predicted as the target of bol-novel- <dig>  mutation in phb resulted in temperature-sensitive growth defect, altered leaf polarity, and enlarged meristem  <cit> . therefore, the first subgroup targets about transcription may trigger a series of developmental processes to regulate meristem development, phase change, and flowering time during head formation under heat stress.

the second subgroup of mirnas and their potential target genes are related to temperature. heat stress uncouples enzymes and metabolic pathways which result in the accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species . cellular antioxidant defense systems protect plants from heat stress-induced oxidative stress so that they can survive under high temperature  <cit> . the target genes of mir165/ <dig> encode the h2o2-scavenging enzyme, cytosolic ascrobate peroxidase . overexpression of capx enhanced tolerance to heat stress in tomato  <cit> . in addition, the downregulation of apx <dig> in the thermosensitivity of the wrky <dig> mutant led to increased generation of reactive oxygen species  under heat stress  <cit> . catalase  <dig> , a predicted target gene of mir <dig> in broccoli, is an ros detoxifying the enzyme catalase in arabidopsis  <cit> . cat <dig> is the antioxidant enzyme that removes h2o <dig> for heat tolerance and is also connected to light entrainment in the circadian rhythm  <cit> . because the circadian clock has a critical role in the flowering transition, the activities of antioxidative enzymes might be necessary for regulating flowering time and thermotolerance mechanisms  <cit> . heat stress-induced ros level can modulate the expression of hsp  <cit> . in this study, the potential targets of the second subgroup mirnas are related to antioxidant systems such as cat <dig> . the transcript level of bo-hsp <dig> and bo-hsp <dig> was lower in the ht genotype than that of hs line . in the ht genotype, it is suggested that the heat stress-induced ros level could be detoxified by the ros-scavenging enzymes cat <dig> leading to decrease in hsp expression. bol-novel- <dig> and bol-novel- <dig> target transcripts encoding carboxylate clamp-type tetratricopeptide repeat proteins and er-resident j-protein, respectively. they are involved in er-resident chaperones and folding enzymes . recent investigations have shown that chaperones are important to facilitate protein homeostasis in response to heat stress  <cit> . the target of bol-novel- <dig> is hexokinase-like <dig> , which mediates a cross-talk between glucose and ethylene response pathways  <cit> . recent evidence showed the involvement of ethylene  in protecting against heat-induced oxidative stress  <cit> . thus, maintaining cellular redox state and protein homeostasis by the ros/redox signaling network, ethylene response pathways, and chaperones may work in concert to mediate heat-tolerance head formation in broccoli.

in the third subgroup of mirnas, target genes were associated with homeostasis of hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid . auxin is an important signal for cell division, elongation or differentiation during inflorescence meristem formation  <cit> . the target mrna for bol-novel- <dig> encodes auxin response factor  <dig>  in response to auxin to regulate developmental transitions, such as seed germination and flower formation  <cit> . pin <dig>  a predicted target gene of bol-novel- <dig> in broccoli, was an auxin efflux carrier to maintain auxin gradients for floral meristem formation  <cit> . aba pathways potentially contribute to increase thermotolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . the target gene of bol-novel- <dig> encodes protein phosphatase 2c , involved in mediating the aba effects in signaling pathways to coordinate various developmental processes and environmental stresses  <cit> . the complex regulatory role of mirnas may participate in auxin and aba homeostasis, which in turn contributes to head formation and thermotolerance mechanism in broccoli.

the fourth subgroup of mirnas may act on energy metabolism. the three predicted broccoli mir <dig> target genes include two families of genes, atp sulfurylases  and sulfate transporter 2; <dig> , are involved in sulfate transport and assimilation  <cit> . sulfate uptake activity and sulfur assimilation depend on light energy harvesting by consumption of atp, glutathione, and ferredoxin  <cit> . the downregulation of aps <dig> and aps <dig> expression may reduced atp consumption with maintenance of energy supply in ht under heat stress. gene encoding the light-harvesting complexes  was potential targets of bol-novel- <dig>  the lhcs of photosystem i  and psii are important for photosynthesis to absorb light, transfer energy, and form atp and nadph  <cit> . in tomato, photosynthesis is significantly reduced under heat stress, but the tolerance lines show a normal photosynthetic rate under high temperature  <cit> . thus, downregulation of these mirnas may lead to maintaining energy homeostasis under heat stress. moreover, loss of function of psad <dig>  the d-subunit of psi, resulted in decreased photosynthesis and delayed flowering by blocking the photosynthetic electron flow  <cit> . the expression of lhcb <dig> /cab <dig> through the circadian cycle could also mediate flowering pathways  <cit> . these evidences imply that these mirnas may target lhc genes, which in turn affect photosynthesis as well as flowering pathways. the target gene of bol-novel- <dig> encode an integral membrane protein of the thylakoid membrane, oxidase assembly  <dig> , and are involved in the assembly of the photosynthetic complexes in arabidopsis  <cit> . taken together, these energy-related targets of broccoli mirnas may play a role in maintaining energy homeostasis for heat-tolerant head formation.

this is the first report of a systematic investigation of mirnaomes between the two genotypes during head formation under high temperature. the expression of mir398b* was greater than that of mir398b in the ht library in transcripts per million . one possible explanation is that the accumulation of mirna* could regulate genes with sufficient complementarity or regulate its corresponding mirna precursor itself during specific developmental stages . four cleavage sites of jmj <dig> were located downstream from the bol-novel- <dig> complementary region . the analogous phenomenon was reported in b. rapa that the broad variance of cleavage sites of the target mrnas were observed as the occasional positional heterogeneity for the cleavage site  <cit> . additionally, the cleaved products of targets might be very unstable, or secondary sirnas were triggered by mirna-mediated cleavage of target mrnas  <cit> . understanding the mirna-mediated regulation network may help in the molecular breeding of broccoli with heat-tolerant head-forming capacity.
