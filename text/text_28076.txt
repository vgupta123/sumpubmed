BACKGROUND
parthenocarpy is defined as fruit set in the absence of fertilization or other stimulation  <cit> . it has the potential to increase yield, especially under unfavorable conditions, e.g. in protected cultivation. moreover, parthenocarpic fruits tend to be firmer and fleshier than seeded ones  <cit> . therefore, development of parthenocarpy cultivars is one of the most important targets in plant breeding.

parthenocarpy can be influenced by environmental, physiological, and genetic factors. environmental conditions such as low temperatures and short day lengths promote parthenocarpy. parthenocarpy has been shown to be dependent certain hormones. for instance, endogenous iaa concentrations in parthenocarpic ovaries or on fruits have been found to be higher than in pollinated organs in cucumbers . there is also evidence that exogenous plant growth-regulating chemical, including auxin and auxin transport inhibitors, gibberellin, cytokinin, and brassinosteroids can induce parthenocarpy . parthenocapy fruit set can be induced with the application of compatible foreign pollen to stigma  because pollen contains auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids  <cit> . moreover, introducing the defh9-iaam auxin-synthesizing gene into cucumber  <cit> , eggplant and tobacco  <cit>  can stimulate parthenocarpy. overexpression of sltir <dig>   <cit> , down-regulated expression of slarf <dig>   <cit>  and sliaa <dig>  transgenic tomatoes  <cit>  also give rise to parthenocarpy. genetic analyses have led to the successful identification of some genes associated with parthenocarpy in tomato and eggplant. in tomatoes, eight parthenocarpic genes—pat, pat- <dig>  pat-3/pat- <dig>  pat <dig> /pat <dig> , and pat <dig> /pat <dig>  were identified. among them, pat, pat <dig> , pat <dig> , pat <dig>  and pat <dig>  were mapped on genetic linkage maps  <cit> . in eggplant, qtl analyses revealed two qtls on chromosome  <dig> and on chromosome  <dig>  which were denoted as controlling parthenocarpy <dig>   and cop <dig> , respectively  <cit> .

parthenocarpy is widespread in cucumber germplasm resources, and so cucumber is a promising model plant for the study of parthenocarpy. genetic studies of parthenocarpy in cucumber started in  <dig>  hawthorn  <cit> , juldasheva  <cit> , and meshcherov  <cit>  found that parthenocarpy in cucumber is controlled by one recessive gene, whereas kvasnikov  <cit> , using a european processing type, proposed that many incompletely recessive genes are responsible for controlling parthenocarpy. kim and pike  <cit>  report that a single incompletely dominant gene controlled parthenocarpy. ponti and peterson  <cit> , conducting an incomplete diallel cross between different pickling cucumber lines, came to the conclusion that three independent, isomeric major genes, control parthenocarpy in conjunction with additive genes. while most recent studies suggest that inheritance of parthenocarpy in cucumber is consistent with characteristics of quantitative traits , and sun  <cit>  identified ten qtls associated with parthenocarpy distributed across four genomic regions as well as eight linked aflp markers in cucumber. however, the location of these qtls on the chromosomes is still unknown, and the related linked markers have neither been confirmed nor been shown to be breeder friendly. hence, qtl mapping of parthenocarpy based on cucumber genome is needed as a means of finding novel qtls and developing effective linked markers. traditional qtl analysis approaches are laborious and time-consuming due to less polymorphic markers for map construction and difficulties of candidate gene prediction. whole genome sequencing methods can overcome these limitations. for example, researchers have used whole genome re-sequencing to genotype  <cit>  or to qtl-seq  <cit> , thereby speeding up the process of qtl mapping.

in this study, we performed a two-season qtl study for parthenocarpy in cucumber in f2: <dig> families from an ec1 × 8419 s- <dig> cross. the major-effect qtl was confirmed with rhl97- <dig> . the effectiveness of linked markers to this qtl was validated in f3: <dig> plants and in  <dig> inbred lines. whole genome re-sequencing allowed us to develop polymonrphic markers and predict candidate genes. the ascertainment of the major-effect qtl of parthenocapy will provide a good foundation for its fine mapping with large segregating population and the linked markers to this qtl will be useful for molecular breeding of parthenocarpy in cucumber.

RESULTS
evaluation of parthenocarpy ability
the phenotypic means, standard deviation and range of parthenocarpy from two seasons are presented in table  <dig> which is based on simple averages of observations. all phenotype data in our study were arcsin transformed. parthenocarpy percentage  means of ec <dig> in spring and fall in  <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . 8419 s- <dig>  by comparison, aborted easily and showed extremely low pp . f <dig> derived from these two parents exhibited medium pp . results from anova and variance component analysis for parthenocarpy from the f2: <dig> population are presented in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and table  <dig> respectively. f2: <dig> family in two seasons both revealed significant difference between f2: <dig> families , seasons , and family × season interactions . the broad sense heritability estimate  for parthenocarpy was  <dig>  %. a significant positive correlation   was also found between pp of f2: <dig> family in different environments. the frequency distribution of pp in f2: <dig> in both seasons was a continuous distribution skewed towards non-parthenocarpy . these results indicate that parthenocarpy is a quantitative trait significantly affected by environment and pp means of families in different seasons could be used for subsequent qtl analyses.table  <dig> phenotypic means and range of parthenocarpy in two parental lines , their f <dig> and 123 f2: <dig> families in spring and fall in 2013

genetic map construction and qtl mapping
after screening  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> indel markers between two parental lines, we identified  <dig> polymorphic pairs . some markers that didn’t show good amplification products or segregate in f <dig> plants were deleted. among them,  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> indel markers were successfully mapped . most of markers fit the expected 1:2: <dig> segregation ratio, with the exception of  <dig> markers  , which exhibited distorted segregation in χ <dig> tests . the map covered a total of  <dig>  cm and contained  <dig> chromosomes. the number of markers on each chromosome was between  <dig> and  <dig>  and the average marker interval of this map was  <dig>  cm . most of marker orders were well consistent with their physical position in  <dig> genome , so we used this linkage map to detect qtls for parthenocarpy in cucumber.

seven qtls for parthenocarpy were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> on the basis of the pp means of f2: <dig> families in spring and fall  <dig> . the additive effects of qtls on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were positive, which indicated the alleles that increase pp come from ec <dig>  whereas qtls on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> had negative additive effects and the alleles that increase pp come from 8419 s- <dig>  in spring, five qtls were detected including parth <dig> at  <dig>  cm  of chromosome  <dig>  parth <dig>  at  <dig>  cm  of chromosome  <dig>  parth <dig>   at  <dig>  cm of chromosome  <dig>  parth <dig>  at  <dig>  cm of chromosome  <dig>  parth <dig>  at  <dig>  cm of chromosome  <dig> . we detected three qtls in fall: parth <dig>  , parth <dig>  at  <dig>  cm  of chromosome  <dig> and parth <dig>  at  <dig>  cm  of chromosome  <dig>  parth <dig>  flanked by ssr <dig> and ssr <dig> was considered as a major-effect qtl since it was the only qtl detected in two seasons and could explain more than 10 % of the phenotypic variance fig.  <dig> qtl mapping of parthenocarpy based on phenotypic data in spring and fall  <dig>  a. all qtls detected in seven chromosomes. b. lod curves of the qtl on chromosome 2

confirmation of the major-effect qtl, parth <dig> 
we confirmed the presence of parth <dig>  with  <dig> plants of rhl97- <dig> segregating for parth <dig>  . plants carrying homozygous alleles of ec <dig> in parth <dig>  region have significantly higher pp  compared to those with homozygous 8419 s- <dig> alleles  at p <  <dig> . similarly, plants harboring the heterozygous alleles of the qtl  were statistically significantly higher than those containing homozygous 8419 s- <dig> alleles but significantly lower than those with homozygous ec <dig> alleles at p <  <dig> . these results confirmed the qtl effect, with  <dig>  % higher pp for plants containing the homozygous ec <dig> alleles over plants with homozygous 8419 s- <dig> alleles at parth <dig> . moreover, pp of the donor parent ec <dig>  was significantly higher than plants having homozygous ec <dig> alleles in the parth <dig>  qtl region , implying that the other qtls also contributed to parthenocarpy in addition to parth <dig> .fig.  <dig> confirmation of the parth <dig>  based on genotype of  <dig> plants in parth <dig>  region. each bar is the mean parthenocary percentage of each category. error bars represent the t value * standard errors of each category with t value from a student-t table. the distinct letters show significance at p <  <dig>  based on anova



a linkage map of parth <dig>  with a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm was constructed based on genotyping of  <dig> plants of rhl97- <dig> with  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> newly developed indel markers . this linkage map was shorter than the map constructed by f <dig> population  and the mean distance between two neighboring markers was  <dig>  cm. linkage mapping analysis showed a major-effect qtl of parthenocarpy with a pve of  <dig>  %. the highest lod score of  <dig>  located between ssr <dig> and indel-t- <dig> according to a 2-lod drop for a confidence interval of the qtl , verifying that the qtl was very likely located in this region.fig.  <dig> high-resolution genetic map in parth <dig>  region and qtl analysis results based on  <dig> plants



validation of the effectiveness of the markers linked to parth <dig> 
indel-t- <dig>  indel-t- <dig> and two flanking markers, ssr <dig> and indel-t- <dig> of parth <dig> , were used to genotype 99 f3: <dig> plants. we classified these plants into three groups according to their genotypes. χ <dig> test results of indel-t- <dig>  indel-t- <dig>  ssr <dig> and indel-t- <dig> were χ2 =  <dig>  > χ <dig> , <dig>  χ2 =  <dig>  > χ <dig> , <dig>  χ2 =  <dig>  > χ <dig> , <dig> and χ2 =  <dig>  > χ <dig> , <dig> respectively indicating that these markers were significantly related to parthenocarpy. the pp means of plants with homozygous ec <dig> alleles at loci indel-t- <dig>  indel-t- <dig>  ssr <dig> and indel-t- <dig> were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively which were significantly higher than those plants with homozygous 8419 s- <dig> alleles  at p <  <dig> . the pp means of plants with heterozygous genotype at loci indel-t- <dig>  indel-t- <dig> and indel-t- <dig> were significantly lower than those with homozygous ec <dig> alleles at p <  <dig>  but not significantly different with those with homozygous 8419 s- <dig> alleles whereas at locus ssr <dig> showed the opposite way .table  <dig> pp means for 99 f3: <dig> plants with different genotypes at ssr <dig>  indel-t- <dig>  indel-t- <dig> and indel-t- <dig> loci

analysis of candidate genes based on re-sequencing and rna-seq of two parents
we carried out whole genome re-sequencing of the two parents to obtain polymorphism data set . the polymorphic nucleotide sequences between ec <dig> and 8419 s- <dig>  including indels, were obtained by comparing the whole genome sequences of ec <dig> and 8419 s- <dig> with the reference ‘9930’ sequence. there were  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels in ec <dig>   <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels in 8419 s- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> .

referring to the cucumber genome database ,  <dig> genes located within the parth <dig>  region. by comparing the whole genome sequences of ec <dig> and 8419 s- <dig> with the reference  <dig> sequence, we found  <dig> candidate genes containing the polymorphic snp/indels in the coding sequence regions that led to missense or frameshift mutations . we further investigated the orthologs of these candidate genes in arabidopsis thaliana using tair  databases. most of them have been functionally characterized . three of  <dig> genes, csa2m <dig> , csa2m <dig>  and csa2m <dig>  were identified as phytohormone related genes. csa2m <dig>  encodes aux/iaa like protein, which functions in various biological processes, e.g. lateral root development, fruit development  <cit> . the tomato aux/iaa transcription factor iaa <dig> is involved in fruit development and leaf morphogenesis  <cit> . the solanum lycopersicum auxin response factor  <dig>  regulates auxin signaling during tomato fruit set and development  <cit> . csa2m <dig>  encodes wd- <dig> repeat family protein, which functions in cytokinin responses  <cit> . csa2m <dig>  encodes prokaryote sensory transduction proteins, which functions in ethylene binding and has ethylene receptor activity .

furthermore, we used the transcriptome data within the parth <dig>   <cit>  and found that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between parthenocapic fruit of ec <dig> and abortive fruit of 8419 s- <dig>  . interestingly, the phytohormone related genes csa2m <dig>  also expressed differentially. moreover, qrt-pcr suggested that transcription of csa2m <dig> , csa2m <dig>  and csa2m <dig>  were continuously up-regulated whereas csa2m <dig> , csa2m <dig>  and csa2m <dig>  were continuously down-regulated during the parthenocarpic fruit set . csa2m <dig>  encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in mitochondrial rna editing. csa2m <dig>  encodes a protein with beta-hexosaminidase activity. csa2m <dig>  encodes vhs domain-containing protein or gat domain-containing protein involved in cyanide biosynthetic process. csa2m <dig>  encodes dna heat shock n-terminal domain-containing protein involved in protein folding. csa2m <dig>  encodes heat shock related-protein involved in protein metabolic process. compared to 8419 s- <dig>  csa2m <dig>  and csa2m <dig>  showed significant expression at p <  <dig>  at  <dig> dpa in ec <dig>  csa2m <dig>  and csa2m <dig>  showed significant expression at p <  <dig>  and  <dig>  at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa respectively in ec <dig> , which were in accordance with transcriptome data . obviously, cshexo <dig> and cswd <dig> were identified by both coding sequence  and qrt-pcr analysis .fig.  <dig> expression level of  <dig> genes by quantitative real-time pcr. a, b and a, b indicate the least significant difference at  <dig>  and  <dig>  between ec <dig> and 8419 s- <dig> at corresponding day post anthesis  respectively. values are the mean ± t * se, with t value from a student-t table



discussion
map construction
it is widely known that cucumber has a narrow genetic base  <cit> , which results in low polymorphism among cultivars. this can be seen from the marker polymorphism between two parents  in this study. in particular, chromosome  <dig> cannot be well covered with published ssr markers. as a result, we used  <dig> indel markers on chromosome  <dig> developed by re-sequencing to screen polymorphic markers and nine of them were assigned to the target region. almost one fifth of the mapped markers deviated from the expected segregation ratio, with some small distorted segregation clusters on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  to test their effects on the linkage map, we constructed the map with or without these deviated markers. finally, we found that marker orders and intervals were not influenced by them. segregation distortion and marker clustering have been reported in cucumber  but the reason for these phenomena is yet unclear. it is difficult to compare the map constructed by sun  <cit>  with the map constructed in this study due to different parents and marker types. although it’s not a high-resolution linkage map, it’s enough for qtl mapping with mapping population size of 100– <dig>  <cit>  because qtl detection power cannot be improved with the increase of the marker dense when the mean marker interval is 5–10 cm  <cit> .

qtls for parthenocarpy in cucumber
expression of multiple genes is influenced by the environment. therefore, it is necessary to identify stable qtls in different environments by using segregated populations. in this study, the values of pp means of donor parent and f <dig> were much higher in spring than in fall. anova showed significant family  × season interaction differences  as well, which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by sun  <cit>  and kikuchi  <cit>  that environment significantly affects expression of parthenocarpic genes. the pp means among the f2: <dig> families in two seasons also exhibited wide genetic variations   and continuous distribution within the range of 0– <dig>  %  . moreover, the close correlation of pp means of f2: <dig> families between two seasons  demonstrated that there was a stable association between phenotype and genotype of parthenocarpy. thus, using these phenotype data in two seasons can detect stable and environment-dependent qtls for parthenocarpy.

we identified five significant qtls in spring and three in fall in this study. five of these qtls showed positive additive effects, which indicated that alleles increasing pp come from high parthenocarpic parent ec <dig>  however, parent 8419 s- <dig> also carried the alleles increasing pp on two qtls of parth <dig>  and parth <dig>  that could explain why 8419 s- <dig> produced parthenocarpic fruits in some plants although pp is pretty low. therefore, the linked markers at parth <dig>  and parth <dig>  from 8419 s- <dig> should be used during mas for parthenocarpy in cucumber. the qtl parth <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  which contributed over 10 % of pve and expressed in both seasons, was a stable and major-effect qtl. the rest of qtls were environment-specific with low pve, indicating that a major and many minor effects mainly contribute to the genetic component of parthenocarpy in cucumber. a study has been carried out for qtl mapping of parthenocarpy in cucumber. sun  <cit>  detected  <dig> qtls in four genomic regions by using f2: <dig> families derived from a cross between two u.s. processing type of lines, however, these qtls were not mapped on chromosomes and thus difficult to infer their locations to the map constructed in this study. therefore, all qtls detected in this study were novel parthenocarpic loci. although parth <dig>  was detected in both seasons, the multiple peaks of the lod curves in this qtl region made it difficult to find the exact qtl . the reason might be the moderate-sized population for phenotypic collection  and moderate marker density that provide less opportunities for recombination and subsequently limit the precision of qtl detection. to improve this situation, a high resolution map in the target region and an advanced population segregating only in this region will be beneficial.

qtl confirmation is an indispensable step to make sure a target qtl that can be further studied and to measure its effect more accurately. using a segregated population, rhl97- <dig>  the major-effect qtl parth <dig>  was confirmed in a homozygous background at other qtls . parth <dig>  provided a  <dig>  % increase in pp in contrast to non-parth <dig>  alleles at parth <dig> , which was significant at p <  <dig> . likewise, pp of plants with homozygous ec <dig> alleles was significantly higher than those with the heterozygous genotype in the qtl region, suggesting a dominance effect, in contrast to the original qtl study which showed a larger additive effect for parth <dig> .

based on the re-sequencing information of two parents, we developed new indel markers to construct a high-resolution linkage map in parth <dig>  region. linkage mapping analysis revealed a major qtl with higher pve of  <dig>  % compared to the original qtl study , demonstrating that the more homozygous the background was, then the higher phenotypic variance could be explained. however, parthenocarpy is a complex trait that phenotypic data of a target individual can be influenced when fertilization is being conducted at the same time. therefore, segregating population construction from one target individual can only be attained by cuttings, which make it difficult to produce enough seeds for further study before the coming planting season and fine mapping of this trait will take longer time. currently we are developing a large segregating population by cuttings from the target individual to fine map this qtl.

linked markers as effective markers in mas of parthenocarpy
attaining closely linked marker is the prerequisite for mas but not all of them can be well applied in breeding. hence, maker validation before application is very important. sun  <cit>  found eight aflp markers linked to parthenocarpy through qtl mapping whereas they were not validated and applied in cucumber breeding. in this study, we validated the effectiveness of the linked markers ssr <dig>  indel-t- <dig>  indel-t- <dig> and indel-t- <dig> with 99 f3: <dig> plants. it was also applied to  <dig> gynoecious and  <dig> monoecious cucumber inbred lines to test its accuracy. among  <dig> gynoecious inbred lines, the extreme phenotype of parthenocarpic lines all showed the same genotype with corresponding parents, which demonstrated that the major-effect parth <dig>  does exist and play roles in extreme parthenocarpy materials. whereas, all monoecious cucumber inbred lines showed low pp , and thus no relationship between the genotypes at these loci and the phenotype was observed. it probably due to fewer female flowers on monoecious plants produce less parthenocarpic fruits, or parthenocarpy in monoecious cucumber is controlled by different qtls which need to be proved. as breeding parthenocarpic cultivars is labor intensive and time-consuming, these dna markers will be effective tools for mas in cucumber.

prediction of parthenocapic candidate genes
mutations between the genes of ec <dig> and 8419 s- <dig> in cds sequences have the potential for transcriptional or functional differences that can regulate parthenocarpic/non-parthenocarpic fruit set. in the present study, we found that  <dig> genes located in parth <dig>  contains missense or frameshift mutations  including three phytohormone related genes. auxin-dependent transcriptional regulation is mediated by regulatory proteins belonging to auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  and auxin response factor  families of transcription factors  <cit> . for example, arf <dig>  a member of arabidopsis arfs family, negatively regulates fruit set and leads to parthenocarpy in tomato and arabidopsis by genetic alterations of arf <dig> function  <cit> . in tomato, solanum lycopersicum arf <dig>  acts as a negative regulator of fruit set and transgenic plants with decreased slarf <dig> mrna levels forms seedless  fruits  <cit> . since csa2m <dig>  is homologous to a member of arabidopsis arfs, arf <dig>  this indicates that it is a promising candidate gene involved in auxin signaling and it may trigger parthenocarpy. another gene, csa2m <dig> , is an ortholog of arabidopsis wd <dig> that plays a role in cytokinin responses  <cit> . it is also a promising candidate gene related to parthenocarpy because cytokinin is another phytohormone that can induce parthenocarpy  <cit> . moreover, a reduction of ethylene production in the zucchini flower is able to induce fruit set and early fruit development, and therefore ethylene is actively involved in fruit set and early fruit development  <cit> . csa2m <dig>  is an ortholog of arabidopsis ethylene insensitive  <dig> that negatively regulates ethylene-activated signaling pathway . this indicates that csein <dig> is also a promising candidate gene possibly involved in ethylene signaling pathway, and may result in parthenocarpy.

previous studies in our lab suggested that endogenous hormones in the ovaries of ec <dig> maintain low levels during the process of fruit formation and development. there is a possibility that ec <dig> displays a hormone insensitive parthenocarpic fruit set  <cit> . so we did not exclude five non-phytohormone related genes, csppr, cshexo <dig>  csmdl, csdjc <dig> and cssmax <dig> as candidate parthenocarpy genes because of their different expression patterns during parthenocarpic fruit set and fruit abortion . furthermore, more evidences are necessary to confirm the exact parthenocarpy genes and the mechanism of parthenocarpic fruit set of ec <dig> is remained to uncover in future study.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a major-effect qtl parth <dig>  and six minor-effect qtls that contribute to the phenotypic variation of parthenocarpy in cucumber. whole genome re-sequencing of two parents is an efficient method for development of polymorphic dna markers and prediction of candidate genes. the marker closely linked to the parth <dig>  is an effective tool for mas of parthenocarpy in cucumber. results from this study improve our understanding of the possible genetic mechanisms that give rise to parthenocarpy in cucumber, and will provide guidance in manipulating it by biotechnology-assisted improvement.
