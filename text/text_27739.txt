BACKGROUND
in the last 50 years, the mean human life expectancy in most developed countries, including south korea, has increased from approximately  <dig> to 80 years, with women having a higher mean life expectancy than do men  <cit> . while genetic factors are the most important determinants of lifespan, it has been suggested that environmental factors such as diet also influence lifespan  <cit> .

during gestation, the fetus develops and grows in the sterile environment of the mother’s uterus. during delivery and immediately afterward, the infant’s external surfaces, such as the gut and skin, are colonized by microbes transmitted from the mother, the environment, and the diet. such colonization is pivotal to development of the gastrointestinal mucosa and the immune system  <cit> . in contrast to the typical viewpoint that healthy intestinal microbiota are relatively stable throughout adulthood, intestinal microbiota are disturbed by exogenous and endogenous factors such as diet, antibiotics, and stress  <cit> . for example, high-fat diets lead to increased levels of gram-negative bacteria that induce lipopolysaccharide production in the intestine, which can lead to inflammation, obesity, and cancer  <cit> . while development of beneficial and stable intestinal microbiota during infancy and childhood is of great interest, a few studies have focused on genetic and physiological factors that affect intestinal microbiota during ageing and on the impact of these modifications on health and longevity  <cit> . recent reports employed advanced molecular characterization techniques such as 16s rrna amplicon sequencing to study intestinal microbiota in ageing individuals, focusing on variability of intestinal microbiota among older subjects and on different effects of ageing, lifestyle, and dietary habits on intestinal microbiota  <cit> .

previous studies have not considered potential differences in gut microbiota between elderly people from urbanized town communities  and those from longevity village communities . in this study, we analyzed fecal microbiota collected from individuals living in  <dig> utc  and  <dig> lvc , selected on the basis of indices for superlongevity  and longevity , as reported by the korea national statistical office  <cit> .

methods
subjects
nine of  <dig> counties in south korea, including  <dig> longevity  rural areas and  <dig> urbanized downtown areas, were investigated according to the methods described by park et al.  <cit> . the lvc selected were damyang , gurye , and sunchang . the mean age of the lvc individuals was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  y and included  <dig> men and  <dig> women . the male age group distribution was:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> . the female age group distribution was:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> . they were selected on the basis of indices for superlongevity  and longevity , as reported by the korea national statistical office  <cit> . lvc were chosen with a superlongevity ratio greater than  <dig> centenarians per  <dig>  populations and a longevity ratio greater than 7%. urbanized south korean communities chosen for the study were seoul, with a population greater than  <dig>  million, and chuncheon with populations greater than  <dig>  million. the mean age of the utc adults was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  y and included  <dig> men and  <dig> women. the male age group distribution was:  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the female age group distribution was:  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the mean age of utc children was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  y and consisted of  <dig> boys  and  <dig> girls . individuals who were under medication, especially those that took antibiotics regularly or during the time of the study, were excluded. recruitment and collection of stool samples were approved by the committee for the care and use of clinical study in the medical school, kyung hee university . enrolled subjects were recruited from kyung hee university medical center, seoul, republic of korea and provided written informed consent to participate in the study. as shown in table  <dig>  no significant difference between utc and lvc in the characteristics of the study subjects was found.table  <dig>

dna extraction, pyrosequencing, and data analysis
genomic dna was extracted from fecal samples using a commercial dna isolation kit  following the manufacturer’s protocol. amplification of genomic dna was performed using barcoded primers that targeted the v <dig> to v <dig> regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene. the amplification, sequencing, and basic analysis were performed according to methods described by chun et al.  <cit>  and completed by chunlab inc.  by using a  <dig> gs flx titanium sequencing system . sequences for each sample were sorted by a unique barcode and low quality reads  were removed. sequence reads were identified using the eztaxon-e database  on the basis of 16s rrna sequence data  <cit> . the number of sequences analyzed, observed diversity richness , estimated otu richness , and pyrosequencing coverage indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig> were calculated using the mothur program and defined considering a cut-off value of 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences.  <dig> pyrosquencing reads have been deposited in the ncbi’s short read archive under accession number srp <dig> 

limulus amoebocyte lysate assay
fecal endotoxin contents were determined by using the diazo-coupled limulus amoebocyte lysate  assays  according to manufacturer’s protocol. briefly, fresh stools were carefully suspended in 9-volumes of pbs in a pyrogen-free tube and sonicated for 1 hr on ice  <cit> . after centrifugation at 400 g for 15 min, the upper 10 ml was collected, sterilized by filtration through a  <dig>  μm filter followed by re-filtration through a  <dig>  μm filter, and inactivated for 10 min at 70°c. filtered sonicate was then incubated with lal solution to continue the analysis.

statistical analysis
the data are expressed as the means ± standard deviations. statistical analysis of the data was performed with one-way analysis of variance . differences with a p <  <dig>  were considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
we used pyrosequencing to analyze gut microbiota compositions in fecal samples from utc adults and children and lvc adults. the rarefaction curves , number of sequences analyzed, and estimated operational taxonomic unit  richness  indicated that the bacterial richness and diversity between lvc and utc was not significantly different.

taxonomy-based analysis showed that the distributions of the major phyla  were consistent with the results of previous human gut studies . however, the main dominant phyla identified in lvc were firmicutes, bacteroidetes, and proteobacteria, whereas those in utc were firmicutes, bacteroidetes, tenericutes, and proteobacteria. the relative abundance of firmicutes, tenericutes, and actinobacteria was significantly lower in lvc than in utc . the relative abundance of firmicutes, bacteroidetes, and proteobacteria in lvc was similar to those in children. due to an increase of firmicutes and a reduction of bacteroidetes, the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes in the gut microbiota was greater in utc adults than in utc children or lvc adults . at the family level, the three most abundant genera in both lvc and utc were ruminococcaceae, bacteroidaceae, and lachnospiraceae . the relative abundance of bacteroidaceae in lvc was higher than that in utc . at the genus level, the  <dig> most abundant genera were bacteroides, prevotella, faecalibacterium, dialister, roseburia, and subdoligranulum, which accounted for an average of 50% of the sequences . the relative abundance of bacteroides, prevotella, and lachnospira in lvc was higher than those in utc but that of subdoligranulum, ruminococcaceae_uc, megamonas, clostridiales_uc.g, am275436_g , blautia, clostridium_g <dig>  and eubacterium_g <dig> in lvc was lower than that in utc .figure  <dig>

discussion
all surfaces of the human body, including the skin, mucosal surfaces, and the genital and gastrointestinal tracts are occupied by habitat-specific microorganisms. during adult life, the composition of gut microbiota is relatively stable. the colon contains  <dig> to  <dig> microbial cells per gram. the community composition of gut microbiota could be influenced by host genetics, health, diet, ageing, and probiotics  <cit> . in culture studies of gut microbiota related to ageing, mitsuoka found that bifidobacteria declined in elderly people compared with younger adults, whereas c. perfringens, lactobacilli, and enterococci increased  <cit> . hopkins et al. found that bifidobacterium and lactobacillus were lower in elderly people than in younger adults, whereas bacteroides and eubacterium were the same  <cit> . health-promoting bacteria such as bifidobacteria have been thought to decrease with advancing age, but the most recent studies based on high-throughput sequencing techniques contradict these previous reports  <cit> . nevertheless, levels of facultative anaerobes, including streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and enterobacteria were higher in the elderly than in younger adults.

recently, it has been reported that clostridium cluster xiva, one of the firmicutes phyla, was decreased in japanese, finnish, and italian elderly and centenarians, whereas it was increased in german older adults  <cit> . faecalibacterium prausnitzii, belonging to the clostridium cluster iv, was markedly decreased in italian elderly and centenarians, but this result was not confirmed in other european populations  <cit> . in addition, bacteroidetes was increased in german, austrian, finnish, and irish elderly, but not in italian elderly and centenarians.

in this study, most of the identified microorganisms belonged to the bacteroidetes and firmicutes phyla. proteobacteria, fusobacteria, and actinobacteria phyla were less than 10% of the total community, similar to previous reports  <cit> . therefore, at the phylum level, the community composition of korean gut microbiota was similar to compositions previously reported for other human populations  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio in utc adults was higher than that in lvc adults and children. interestingly, we found no difference in the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio between children and lvc. these changes are consistent with the results from the principal coordinate analysis.

in the present study, anthropometric characteristics and eating as well as smoking habits were not different in both adult samples. however, according to the study by yon et al.  <cit>  which investigated food consumption and dietary pattern in middle aged and older adults  living in gugoksundam  longevity area where we selected the lvc adults for the present study, the average total daily food intake was significantly decreased with aging and animal food intake ratio to total food intake was ranged 10– <dig> % which is significantly lower than the korean average animal food intake reported in the korea national health and nutrition examination survey in  <dig>  furthermore, kim et al.  <cit>  reported that the intake of vegetables in the rural elderly was significantly higher than in the urban elderly when they performed the survey to evaluate dietary behavior, food intake, and satisfaction with food-related life between the elderly living in urban and rural areas of korea. in addition, the rural elderly had better balanced diet and were more satisfied with food related life than those of the rural elderly. these results suggest that animal food and vegetable intakes may alter the gut microbiota composition.

we also found that the compositions of faecalibacterium spp. and bacteroides spp. in utc and lvc samples were different. although the levels of faecalibacterium prausnitzii in utc and lvc were not significantly different, ef402172_s and ef404388_s, belonging to faecalibacterium spp. were the predominant intestinal microbiota  identified in lvc samples but not utc samples. some bacteroides spp., acwh_s, ef403317_s, and ef403722_s, were detected only in lvc samples, but they constituted less than  <dig> % of the gut microbiota. some intestinal bacteria, 4p001066_s , 4p000016_s , dq905574_s , gq073186_s , and am277319_s  were detected only in utc samples. in these conditions, the fecal lps content was significantly higher in utc adults than lvc adults. these results suggest that the increased levels of gut microbiota lps by increased animal food intake, decreased vegetable intake, and increased and/or only detected intestinal bacteria in utc adults may induce unresolved chronic inflammation which is described as an underlying mechanism of aging and age-related diseases reviewed in  <cit> . in addition, the anti-inflammatory faecalibacterium spp. ef402172_s and ef404388_s might play an important role in preserving individuals’ health in lvc by inhibiting the production of lps. in this study, the comparative analysis of gut microbiota in children and elderly people of urbanized towns and longevity villages suggest that maintaining gut microbiota of healthy children with dietary interventions could be beneficial to promote healthier ageing.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the gut microbiota composition and lps levels of the elderly people of utc were significantly different from that of the elderly community of lvc, which is quite similar to that observed in utc children. among bacteroides spp., acwh_s, ef403317_s, and ef403722_s were detected in lvc and children samples only. ef402172_s and ef404388_s, members of faecalibacterium spp., which are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, were detected in lvc and children samples only . in addition, the fecal lipopolysaccharides  content was significantly higher in utc than in lvc. our findings suggest that the alteration in the composition of gut microbiota and decrease in lps levels provably driven by diet may play an important role in preserving residents’ health in lvc.
