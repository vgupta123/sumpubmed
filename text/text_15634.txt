BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium causing many kinds of infections from mild respiratory tract infections to life-threatening states as sepsis. it produces many toxins and has a remarkable ability to acquire resistance to antimicrobial drugs. many s. aureus strains have acquired resistance to commonly used antibiotics and some strains are becoming multi-resistant. methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus  is the principal cause of severe nosocomial infections which can be fatal to compromised patients. whole genome sequencing of two mrsa strains in  <dig> was regarded as a way to find targets for novel antibiotics against infections caused by mrsa  <cit> .

prsa protein is found ubiquitously in gram-positive bacteria, including s. aureus , but not in gram-negative ones  <cit> . by sequence homology prsa contains a parvulin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase  domain and flanking n- and c-terminal domains. ppiases are enzymes that catalyze cis-trans-isomerization of the peptide bonds preceding proline residues  <cit> . biological role of ppiases is to act as chaperones or foldases in protein folding and remodelling. fk <dig> binding proteins , cyclophilins and parvulins form the three classes of ppiases each having their own fold, substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism.

prsa is localized at the space between plasma membrane and cell wall and it is bound to the cell membrane through a lipid-anchor attached to the n-terminal cysteine residue  <cit> . it has been shown to have a role as folding catalyst of secreted proteins. in bacteria, secreted proteins include enzymes important for formation of the cell wall and toxins. due to importance of the catalyzed reaction in protein folding prsa is a potential target for novel antimicrobial drugs. prsa has been previously shown to be an essential protein for viability of b. subtilis  <cit> .

parvulin-type ppiases are ~ <dig> residues long globular protein domains folding into a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet core surrounded by four α-helices   <cit> . parvulin-type ppiases have been found both in bacteria and in eukaryotes. at present there are structures of  <dig> different parvulins available in the protein data bank: human pin <dig>   <cit>  and par <dig>  <cit> , pin1at from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , par <dig>   <cit>  and sura  <cit>  from escherichia coli, ess <dig> from candida albicans  <cit>  and prsa-ppiase from bacillus subtilis  <cit> . also several other parvulin-type ppiases are known, e.g. par <dig> from bordetella pertussis  <cit> , but their structures are still to be solved. the subtypes of parvulins differ in length and composition of the s1-h <dig> loop. in hpin1-type parvulins the loop has a high number of positively charged residues and this is thought to induce the preference for substrates having a negatively charged residue, preferably a phosphorylated serine/threonine, before the processed proline  <cit> . in par14-type parvulins this loop is missing and in sura ppiase domain i the s1-h <dig> loop contains mainly hydrophobic residues  <cit> .

prsa of s. aureus shows 24% amino acid sequence conservation to prsa protein from bacillus subtilis . the ppiase domain is the most conserved area of the sequence . sequence comparison of b. subtilis and s. aureus prsa-ppiases shows that they differ in length and nature of the s1-h <dig> loop. s. aureus prsa-ppiase contains a long loop rich of lysine residues whereas in b. subtilis prsa the loop is very short. this suggests that the structure and the substrate specificity of s. aureus prsa-ppiase would rather resemble hpin1-type parvulins than b. subtilis prsa-ppiase.

since prsa is known to be an essential protein for other gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  it is a potential target for antimicrobial drugs against s. aureus infections. exact knowledge of the structure and catalysis mechanism of prsa-ppiase is a prerequisite for successful design of efficient and selective enzyme inhibitors to be used as antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria. we have studied structure and function of the parvulin-type prsa-ppiase from s. aureus using nmr spectroscopy.

RESULTS
protease-coupled ppiase assay
the results of protease-coupled ppiase assay confirm the prolyl isomerase activity of s. aureus prsa-ppiase . the highest catalytic activity  was observed with suc-aepf-pna peptide. comparison with the results obtained with prsa-ppiase from b. subtilis indicates difference in the substrate preference. the enzyme from s. aureus prefers a substrate having a negatively charged residue before the proline residue . the same enzyme from b. subtilis has the highest catalytic activity towards suc-akpf-pna peptide.

structure determination
1h-15n-hsqc spectrum of prsa-ppiase  shows clearly resolved signals of a well-folded protein. however, there is a second set of signals with about one fifth of intensity of the main signals. despite attempts to change the sample conditions and the protein construct we were unable to remove this extra set of signals from the 1h-15n-hsqc spectrum. both sds-page analysis and mass spectra indicate that there is only one kind of polypeptide present in the sample. narrow distribution of the 1h chemical shifts of the minor signals implies that they originate from an unstructured polypeptide. a closer inspection of the noesy spectra showed that these resonances have practically no noes. from this we concluded that the extra signals belong to an unfolded form of prsa-ppiase which probably would not interfere with the structure determination and we proceeded with this sample. sequential assignment of the extra signals  indeed confirmed they originate from the same polypeptide sequence as the main signals.

all backbone amide signals except k <dig> are visible in the 1h-15n-hsqc spectrum and were sequentially assigned. assignments were found for 97% of all 1h-, 13c- and 15n-resonances. majority of the missing assignments belong to the overlapping side chain resonances of numerous lysine residues. peak picking of the three-dimensional 13c- and 15n-edited noesy-hsqc spectra yielded  <dig> and  <dig> cross-signals, respectively. total of  <dig> distance restraints were extracted from the noesy spectra with the automatic noesy signal assignment and torsion angle dynamics procedure of cyana  <dig>  software  <cit> . after the final molecular dynamics refinement with amber program  <cit>   <dig> structures were chosen to the representative structure family. the final set of structures contains neither distance restraint violations over  <dig>  Å nor dihedral angle restraint violations exceeding 7°. according to the structure statistics  and the quality analysis with procheck-nmr  <cit>  and what_check  <cit>  the structure determination yielded a structure family of excellent quality. rmsd between the structures  is  <dig>  Å for the backbone and  <dig>  Å for all the heavy atoms. if the somewhat less ordered residues of the s1-h <dig> loop  are excluded, rmsd drops to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively. over 99% of the residues reside on the favoured regions of the ramachandran plot.

since there is a distracting difference in the orientation of the two conserved active site histidines between the crystal  <cit>  and the solution  <cit>  structures of parvulin ppiases, we decided to look into the construction of the active site of the enzyme more closely. the results of protonation and tautomeric state determination of the active site histidines  are represented in figure  <dig>  due to partially overlapping h <dig> and h <dig> h2-c <dig> signals the protonation state determination yielded only an average value of the two residues for peptide-unbound form of prsa-ppiase. based on the average value one can judge that the histidines are in deprotonated state. the suc-aepf-pna titration however separated the two h2-c <dig> signals and enabled separate determination of the protonation states. protonation state and tautomeric state of the active site histidines were not affected by the presence of substrate peptide suc-aepf-pna. both h <dig> and h <dig> are in deprotonated state but they differ in tautomeric state of the side chain. h <dig> is in n3-protonated state whereas h <dig> binds the proton through n <dig> . also the c <dig> chemical shifts of the histidines support this conclusion  <cit> .

structure description
structure of prsa-ppiase  is a typical parvulin-fold consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet core  and four α-helices  surrounding it. prsa-ppiase has a ten-residue extended loop containing four positively charged lysine residues  between s <dig> and h <dig>  this loop is more loosely defined compared with the rest of the structure, and it lacks regular secondary structure. the hydrophobic core of the protein on the concave side of the β-sheet is formed by l <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  l <dig> and i <dig> and by the two histidines  occupying the active site. on the convex side of the β-sheet the main hydrophobic residues attaching the helices h <dig> and h <dig> are i <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  v <dig> and i <dig>  the antiparallel orientation of the active site histidine ring planes brings the n <dig> nitrogens next to each other . the differing tautomeric state of the two histidines enables a hydrogen bond to be formed between the histidine rings.

peptide titrations
location of the active site and structural changes during enzyme action were probed by titration experiments with proline containing tetrapeptides previously shown to be substrates for parvulin ppiases  <cit> . titration of prsa-ppiase with suc-axpf-pna  substrate peptides induced chemical shift perturbations in the 1h-15n-hsqc spectrum. however, large excess of peptide was needed in all three cases in order to achieve clear changes in the spectrum. the binding affinity of the peptides was in millimolar range . largest chemical shift perturbations were observed at helix h <dig>  strand s <dig> and at s2-h <dig> and s3-s <dig> loops which reflects the typical substrate binding site of parvulins   <cit> . upon titration with the suc-aepf-pna peptide chemical shift changes were observed also at the s1-h <dig> loop. this behaviour was not observed with other peptides used. the s1-h <dig> loop contains a cluster of positively charged lysines which presumably participate in binding of the negatively charged glutamate side chain of the substrate. during suc-aepf-pna titration chemical shift changes of the aromatic side chains were also followed using 1h-13c-hsqc spectrum. h <dig> proton resonances of the both active site histidines moved about  <dig>  ppm upfield  which reflects a close proximity to the peptide binding site.

dynamics and exchange
the dynamical behaviour of the protein was depicted through generalized order parameter s <dig>  which was extracted from r <dig> and r <dig> relaxation rates and heteronuclear noes of the backbone amides. additional information on dynamics was gained through backbone amide exchange rates. the generalized order parameters and the exchange rates were determined both in presence and in absence of the suc-aepf-pna peptide substrate. the data for k <dig> and s <dig> and the relaxation data for d <dig> are missing due to low intensity of the 1h-15n-hsqc signals, and the data for v <dig> and e <dig> are missing due to signal overlap. the relaxation analysis was successfully applied for all the residues containing complete set of relaxation data. graph of generalized order parameter s <dig> as function of sequence  shows an overall s <dig> of about  <dig>  and a consistent decrease at the s1-h <dig> loop. presence of suc-aepf-pna peptide induced changes in the order parameter at the loops surrounding the active site but also at the h <dig> helix . the backbone amide proton exchange rates are slow within the secondary structure elements and the regions of faster exchange reflect the dynamical behaviour of the protein demonstrated by the order parameters . the fastest exchange rates are observed for residues at the s1-h <dig> loop and at the loops facing the active site cavity.

discussion
in this study we have investigated the structure and function of the parvulin-type ppiase domain of prsa protein from s. aureus. nmr spectroscopic structure determination of prsa-ppiase yielded a high-quality structure which enabled investigation of the catalytic site in detail. solution structure of prsa-ppiase shows close structural similarity to hpin1-type parvulins but also some important differences in constitution of the active site. the original hypothesis on the catalysis mechanism of the parvulin-type ppiases is based on the crystal structure of hpin <dig>  <cit> . however, the recent studies of hpin <dig>  <cit>  have provided new insight into the functional status of the active site residues and thus have brought the original catalysis mechanism into question. the solution structure of s. aureus prsa-ppiase supports these findings but also brings out some new aspects into the debate.

the results of protease-coupled ppiase assay indeed confirm that prsa-ppiase functions as a prolyl-isomerase. the most efficient catalysis was observed with suc-aepf-pna peptide. the substrate preference of s. aureus prsa-ppiase resembles that of hpin <dig> which was somewhat expected based on common s1-h <dig> loop rich of positively charged residues. binding of multivalent anions to the s1-h <dig> loop of prsa-ppiase was also confirmed by nmr titrations with sodium sulphate . clear chemical shift perturbations resembling the ones bayer et al. observed with hpin <dig>  <cit>  were detected at the s1-h <dig> loop. paradoxically, the protease-coupled ppiase assay showed practically no prolyl-isomerase activity towards suc-apf-pna peptides.

the overall structure of prsa-ppiase shows resemblance to the previously published parvulin ppiase structures. a structure similarity search with dali program  <cit>  gave hpin <dig>  and c. albicans ess <dig>  as the two closest hits with  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å backbone rmsds, respectively. the h1-s <dig> loop of positively charged residues is also present in hpin <dig> and ess <dig>  being a potential target for anticancer drugs, the human mitotic regulator hpin <dig> is the most studied parvulin. overlay of prsa-ppiase and the crystal structure of hpin <dig> containing alapro dipeptide substrate  <cit>  shown in figure 8a indicates that the largest differences between the two structures are found at the loosely defined s1-h <dig> loop and at the h1-h <dig> loop. prsa-ppiase of b. subtilis lacks the extended loop between the s <dig> sheet and the h <dig> helix. overlay of the secondary structure elements the two prsa-ppiases reveals the difference in the orientation and length of the h <dig> helix . otherwise the backbone traces of the two prsa-ppiases are fairly similar.

the active site of prsa-ppiase was mapped by nmr titrations with parvulin substrate peptides. our results conform well with the previous studies with other parvulins  <cit> . largest chemical shift changes occurred at h <dig> helix, s <dig> strand and at s2-h <dig> and s3-s <dig> loops which face the active site and contain the residues thought to participate in the catalysis mechanism . based on the nmr titrations the dissociation constant for all tested peptides was in millimolar regime and most of the spectral changes were practically the same with all the three peptides. during the suc-aepf-pna peptide titration, but not with the other peptides, we observed consistent chemical shift perturbations at the s1-h <dig> loop. backbone amide titration data demonstrates involvement of the s1-h <dig> loop in substrate binding when the substrate contains a negatively charged glutamate residue before the processed proline.

referring to previously published nmr titration data, bailey et al. concluded recently that parvulin active site histidines are not involved in substrate binding  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that nmr chemical shift perturbation studies are commonly done using only backbone n-h correlations . participation of the active site histidines  in the substrate binding is not easily observed in 1h-15n-hsqc-based nmr titrations since backbone amides reside quite far from the peptide binding site. involvement of the histidine side chains in substrate binding is however clearly evidenced by the chemical shift perturbations in the 1h-13c-hsqc spectrum of the aromatic residues .

a plot of generalized order parameters s <dig> as function of sequence demonstrates a tightly folded protein . reduced s <dig> values at the s1-h <dig> loop indicate that the loop is more flexible than the rest of the structure. conformational variation of the structure family at the s1-h <dig> loop is thus an indication of real dynamic behaviour, not solely a lack of noe distance restraints . this flexibility enables induced fit mechanism during binding of negatively charged substrate peptides. especially interesting is the rather low s <dig> of t <dig>  this threonine also stands out in the amide proton exchange rate plot with a high exchange rate . order parameter of the solvent exposed t <dig> might be distorted due to chemical exchange of the amide proton with water. presence of peptide substrate  induces some changes in the order parameters and exchange rates . most of the changes are, as expected, at the loops surrounding the active site and carrying the catalytic residues. however, somewhat unexpected changes are observed in the helix h <dig> which is rather distant from the peptide binding site. since the relaxation experiments were conducted in presence of suc-aepf-pna peptide, which has a negatively charged residue before the proline, the changes in s <dig> values for the h <dig> helix might be due to rearrangement of the s1-h <dig> loop during peptide binding. the s1-h <dig> loop can be acting as a hinge twisting the h <dig> helix.

tautomeric state of the active site histidine residues was determined using nmr spectroscopy . the active site histidines are highly conserved in all parvulin ppiases. there is a systematic discrepancy regarding the conformation of these histidines between the crystal structures and the solution structures  <cit> . in the crystal structures the histidine side chain n <dig> nitrogens point to opposite directions whereas in the solution structures they face each other . the ring planes of both histidines are flipped 180° changing the exact location of the ring nitrogens. the noe distance restraints define the orientation seen in the nmr structures unambiguously . this difference is crucial regarding the discussion on the catalysis mechanism. the original hypothesis of the catalysis mechanism of parvulin ppiases was made based on the crystal structure of hpin <dig>  <cit> . changing the orientation of the histidine ring planes affects the location of the transferable protons of the imidazole moieties. using nmr spectroscopy we were also able to determine the tautomeric state of the histidines: in s. aureus prsa-ppiase h <dig> is n3-protonated and h <dig> is n1-protonated . this combination of tautomeric states enables hydrogen bonding between the n <dig> nitrogens of the two histidines and it also creates prerequisites for a charge relay system through the active site of the enzyme   <cit> . the role of the parvulin active site histidines was recently discussed in detail by bailey et al.  <cit> . using a thorough array of active site histidine mutants of hpin <dig> they showed that the histidines are not essential for the catalytic activity of hpin <dig> but rather have a structural role and impact on the stability of the ppiase domain. it was noted that the capability of these residues to form hydrogen bonds is not an absolute requirement for proper enzyme function and that the double-mutant h59l/h157l even exhibited surprisingly high activity. the double-mutant was regarded to enhance the integrity of the catalytic site and the stability of the enzyme through additional hydrophobic contacts in the protein core. the hydrogen bonding between the active site histidines might also be a way to stabilise the parvulin fold. when this interaction is interrupted by single histidine mutation the stabilisation is lost but the double-mutant, even through a different mechanism , restores some of the stabilisation. whether the histidines actively participate in the catalysis or solely serve as structural support for the catalytic machinery remains to be confirmed.

the original parvulin catalysis mechanism presented by ranganathan et al.  <cit>  has been disproved  <cit> . comparison of the active site structure of s. aureus prsa-ppiase and other parvulin ppiases questions the residues proposed to be responsible for the catalysis in parvulins  <cit> . the cysteine residue c <dig> of hpin <dig> was originally claimed to act as a nucleophile starting the catalysis . this residue is replaced in s. aureus and in b. subtilis prsas by an aspartate  which is also a potential nucleophile. in fact, behrsin et al. have proved that the pin <dig> c113d mutant remains functional  <cit> . forthcoming steps of the original catalysis mechanism  <cit>  include participation of a serine residue  acting as a proton donor. in s. aureus prsa-ppiase this residue is replaced by phenylalanine  which is not capable of carrying out protonation/deprotonation steps. the same situation is also faced with other parvulin ppiases e.g. e. coli par <dig>  <cit>  and hpar <dig>  <cit> . in some parvulin ppiases this residue is replaced by valine and for example in b. subtilis prsa by tyrosine  <cit> . evidently the original catalysis mechanism proposed based on the crystal structure of hpin <dig> cannot be a universal route of the reaction for all parvulins. a closer inspection of the active site of s. aureus prsa-ppiase reveals a somewhat symmetric assembly of aspartate and serine residues on both sides of the histidine pair . similar set of residues is also found in b. subtilis prsa  <cit> . mutation studies of b. subtilis prsa have shown that d154a substitution  destroys only half of the catalytic activity of prsa  <cit> . obviously some other residue can perform the role of the nucleophilic residue when it is inactivated by mutation. the symmetrical assembly of aspartates and serines and the charge relay system through the active site histidines would imply a protonation/deprotonation step as part of the catalytic mechanism. the charge relay system  could facilitate deprotonation of the aspartates which would enhance their nucleophilic character. in light of the diverse structural and functional data on parvulin ppiases one inevitably raises a question whether all parvulin ppiases even share the same catalysis mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
the solution structure of prsa-ppiase from s. aureus enables detailed study of its function and target based design of inhibitors. highly conserved protein sequences are also found in other staphylococcus subspecies. exact biological role and importance of prsa are still unclear although it is known to act as a foldase of secreted proteins   <cit>  and it is shown to be essential for b. subtilis  <cit> . natural substrates of s. aureus prsa-ppiase are not known at present, but the enzyme may prefer substrates where a negatively charged residue precedes the processed proline. the structure of the catalytic site of s. aureus prsa-ppiase conflicts with the original hypothetical catalysis mechanism of parvulin ppiases. recent studies also recognize the deficiencies of the parvulin catalysis mechanism  <cit> . the orientation and the tautomeric state of the active site histidine residues of s. aureus prsa-ppiase suggest that the catalytic mechanism includes a protonation/deprotonation step facilitated by a charge relay system through the active site histidine pair. on the other hand, the hydrogen bonding between the active site histidines might merely serve as a structural stabilisation mechanism of the enzyme fold. apparently the catalysis mechanism of parvulin-type ppiases still needs some clarifications. existing structural data on parvulins can be used to design further experiments, e.g. site-directed mutagenesis, to decipher the detailed catalysis mechanism.
