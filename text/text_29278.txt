BACKGROUND
the pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease  have been researched intensely. in general, it is believed that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. when ibd was originally described, a close resemblance to infectious diseases of the gut was noticed. therefore, many different bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms have been suspected to cause ibd. it is now well established that luminal factors in the intestine are involved in the inflammatory process of crohn's disease  and ulcerative colitis . for example, diversion of the continuity of the intestines results in healing of the resting gut, whereas the inflammation will return when continuity is reestablished  <cit> . furthermore, several animal models have documented the participation of bacteria in the inflammatory process  <cit> . more importantly, the recent finding of a defect in the caspase recruitment domain family, member  <dig> , gene among cd patients, has reawakened the search for specific involved pathogens  <cit> . nod2/card <dig> is believed to be involved in the innate immune system including the production of defensins; therefore, defects in this gene could indicate that the host is more susceptible to microorganisms  <cit> . it has also been shown that the number of viable internalized s. typhimurium in caco <dig> cells was higher when the caco <dig> cells were transfected with a variant card15/nod <dig> expression plasmid associated with crohn's disease  <cit> .

escherichia coli are among the most interesting bacteria in the human gut. certain e. coli clones with specific virulence factors are involved in extraintestinal infections the so called extraintestinal pathoghenic e. coli , and these bacteria often cause both urinary tract infections and septicemia. furthermore, specific e. coli are involved in childhood diarrhea, , tourist diarrhea , and recently, bloody diarrhea associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome .

in the 1970's, it was found that hemolytic e. coli were linked to active uc, although it was believed that the hemolytic e. coli were innocent bystanders, and their presence in the colon was assisted by the inflammation but did not cause it  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been shown that apathogenic e. coli prevents relapse of uc just as well as mesalazine  <cit> . furthermore, e. coli has been linked to cd, since an abundance of specific adherent-invasive e. coli was found in resected ileum from patients with cd, compared to non inflamed ileum resected due to other causes  <cit> . very recently, it was demonstrated by ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis that enterobacteriaceae are more abundant in tissue samples from patients with ibd compared to controls, and after culture, specific phylogenetic groups of e. coli were found to be more frequent among patients with uc and cd  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that e. coli are very predominant in inflamed mucosa of patients with uc, and that these strains based on  <dig> s rrna pcr are "active" and overrepresented in comparison with the microbiota of healthy controls, who generally had a higher biodiversity of the active microbiota  <cit> . in addition, an exuberant inflammatory response to e. coli has been demonstrated among patients with uc  <cit> .

the aim of our study was to characterize possible differences in phylogenetic group, serotype, expec genes and virulence between e. coli isolated from patients with active ibd, patients with inactive disease and healthy controls, as well as to examine whether multilocus sequence typing  could further distinguish between these e. coli. mlst is considered the most stable and appropriate of currently available molecular typing techniques for long term epidemiology and for the identification of bacterial lineages that have an increased propensity to cause disease  <cit> .

RESULTS
fecal samples were collected from  <dig> patients with ibd with present or past involvement of the left side of the colon and from  <dig> healthy controls. in both patients and controls, a sigmoidoscopy was performed. ten patients were found to have a non-inflamed mucosa, whereas  <dig> had clear inflammation in the sigmoid colon. more detailed characteristics of patients are presented in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> e. coli strains were isolated from study subjects. from  <dig> patients and  <dig> control, no e. coli could be isolated. from one patient with active ibd and one patient with inactive ibd two different e. coli strains from each patient were isolated based on mlst, serotyping and phylogenetic typing. from all controls and all other patients only one strain of e. coli from each subject was isolated.

e. coli strains were studied with respect to phylogenetic group, expec genes, multilocus sequence type, serotype and virulence factors. interestingly, among patients and controls with a positive e. coli culture, b <dig> strains were cultured most frequently from patients with ibd, 60% , compared to 11%  from healthy controls . in addition, b <dig> e. coli strains were cultured most frequently from patients with active ibd, 86% , compared to 38%  among patients with inactive colitis, but this difference did not reach statistical significance . however, when comparing the number of b <dig> e. coli strains with at least one positive expec gene among different groups , significantly more strains, 86% , were found positive among active ibd patients, compared to 13%  among inactive ibd patients  and 11%  among healthy controls . among the  <dig> e. coli strains, representing  <dig> o-serogroups,  <dig> sequence types were identified using multilocus sequence typing  . the b <dig> phylogenetic group associated with ibd was found in a specific cluster based on mlst, confirming a common ancestry of these ibd associated b <dig> e. coli, but no further separation was achieved between strains involved in active compared to inactive ibd. from most patients with active ibd, 71%, e. coli were cultured with o-serotypes normally categorized as uropathogenic, compared to 25%  in ibd in remission and 11% among healthy controls . although hemolytic e. coli were isolated more frequently from patients with ibd  compared to healthy controls ; this difference did not reach statistical significance .

discussion
in our study based on fecal samples from patients with previous or present left-sided colitis and from controls, we found a strong correlation between isolation of e. coli of the phylogenetic group b <dig> and ibd; no correlation was found with other phylogenetic groups including group d. further, we found a trend toward an association between the presence of b <dig> e. coli and active colitis. a recent study has demonstrated that the presence of specific e. coli , in colonic biopsies, are associated with ibd, however patients were not stratified according to activity of the disease or to disease localization  <cit> . our patients were well-defined regarding disease localization , which could explain the very specific association between b <dig> e. coli and ibd in our study. controls  were younger than ibd patients, however, in broad terms the colonic microbiota is generally viewed as being a stable entity within an individual  <cit> . moreover, previous studies of b <dig> e. coli did not show an increase in the probability of detecting a b <dig> e. coli with increasing age in the age groups participating in our study  <cit> .

b <dig> strains are often found among expec strains and when testing for  <dig> genes commonly associated with expec  <cit> , we found a statistically significant association between active ibd and b <dig> strains with at least one positive expec gene, when comparing to both controls and to patients with inactive disease. the enhanced virulence potential of expec strains is thought to be caused mainly by their multiple virulence factors such as adhesins, siderophores, toxin polysaccharide coatings; e.g., these virulence factors would help the bacteria to avoid host defenses, injure or invade host cells and tissues and stimulate a noxious inflammatory response  <cit> . it has been suggested that features, which commonly have been regarded as virulence factors in expec isolates, are also factors promoting intestinal colonization  <cit> . this could explain why expec strains are more prevalent in patients with uc, where the inflamed mucosa could prevent colonization with e. coli of a more commensal nature.

whether ibd associated b <dig> e. coli can be differentiated from other b <dig> expec strains is at present not known. in this regard it was interesting to find a possible association of the ibd associated b <dig> e. coli with afa, afimbrial adhesin, an adhesin which exist in different subtypes depending on the physiological site from which the afa positive e. coli were isolated  <cit> . furthermore, the afimbrial adhesin has been demonstrated to cause functional lesions in the intestinal brush border, impairment of the epithelial barrier and proinflammatory responses in cultured human intestinal cells that express the structural and functional characteristics of human enterocytes  <cit> .

mlst confirmed the common ancestry of the b <dig> e. coli, since they were all found in the same phylogenetic group, but unfortunately, no further information could be obtained regarding stratification of the b <dig> e. coli from active ibd patients compared to inactive ibd patients. previously b <dig> e. coli strains have been described using mlst and subgroups have been identified  <cit> , but our b <dig> strains were of sequence types typically found in different subgroups, making further information regarding these strains using mlst unlikely.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the clonal nature, based on mlst and phylogenetic group, of e. coli isolates from ibd patients with left-sided colitis contradicts an assumption that ibd through an impaired immune system simply allows an overrepresentation of e. coli at random. some active participation by the microorganism is certainly indicated, either due to colonization advantages or as a part of ibd pathogenesis. future studies of the effects of ibd associated e. coli in both cell assays and animal models will help to clarify the role of these bacteria in the inflammatory process.
