BACKGROUND
it is well known that bone tissue has the capacity to alter its mass and structure in response to mechanical strain. osteocytes are terminally differentiated cells derived from osteoblasts, which first become embedded and surrounded by osteoid matrix that subsequently mineralizes  <cit> . they are regarded as the mechanosensory cells that respond to mechanical loading and a variety of hormones such as vitamin d and pth, and sends signals to other bone cells to initiate bone formation and remodeling  <cit> . a better understanding of the gene networks regulating osteocytes can therefore lead to new therapies for osteoporosis, loss of bone in space travel and extended bed rest. however, even though osteocytes are the most abundant cells in bone, the regulatory pathways controlling osteocyte biology have not been identified.

as osteocytes are embedded within the bone matrix, with a complex network between the different stages of cells within the osteoblast-osteocyte lineage, studies of osteocytes have been hampered by their inaccessibility and by the lack of molecular and cell surface markers that could be used to isolate and characterize this cell population  <cit> . dentin matrix protein  has been shown as a good marker for the osteocyte lineage and is specifically expressed along and in the canaliculi of osteocytes within the bone matrix, suggesting a role for dmp <dig> in osteocyte function. recently, we generated a mouse model containing a dmp <dig> region, - <dig> to + <dig> bp , driving gfp and thus directing expression to osteocytes  <cit> . this enables us to purify osteocytes from osteoblast cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and compare the gene expression profiles in these two types of cells directly using microarray.

in this work, we developed a systems biology approach to study osteocyte biology by integrating data from microarray experiments, functional annotations and comparative genomics. this type of approaches has been shown to greatly eliminate noises contained in individual data sources, and improve the understanding of complex biological phenomena, such as alzheimer's disease and cancer  <cit> . typically, this type of approaches starts with identifying a set of differentially expressed genes, and then clusters genes according to their expression profiles or functions, followed by an analysis of cis-regulatory elements presented in the promoter sequences. our method differs from those approaches in two important aspects. first, we only considered cis-regulatory elements that are both over-represented and evolutionary conserved. this significantly reduced the effective lengths of promoter regions when searching for cis-regulatory elements, and therefore eliminated many spurious matches. moreover, we developed a graph theoretical method to identify transcriptional regulatory modules   <cit> , which revealed interesting combinatorial relationships between several transcription factors.

briefly, from microarray experiments, we obtained  <dig> osteocyte-specific genes, many of which have functions in bone or muscle development and contractility. we then identified enriched and evolutionarily conserved cis-regulatory elements from the  <dig> kb upstream promoter regions of a subset of  <dig> bone- and muscle-related genes, and used these data to construct a transcriptional regulatory network that links tfs to their putative binding sites on these  <dig> genes. we further proposed a graph-partitioning algorithm to identify possible cis-regulatory modules  <cit> . our results show that many osteocyte-specific genes, including two well-known osteocyte markers dmp <dig> and sost, have highly conserved clustering of muscle-related cis-regulatory modules, thus supporting the concept that a muscle-related gene network is important in osteocyte biology and may play a role in contractility and dynamic movements of the osteocyte.

RESULTS
bone and muscle-related genes are over-expressed in osteocyte cells
to identify potential regulatory networks of osteocytes, we obtained gene expression profiles from osteocytes purified from calvariae of 5â€“ <dig> day-old mice expressing  <dig> kb dmp <dig> promoter driving gfp. as a control, we also obtained gene expression profiles from gfp-negative cells, which contain about 60% osteoblasts at different stages  and some macrophages. the microarray data is then normalized using gcrma  <cit>  and significantly differentially expressed genes were identified. we identified  <dig> genes that are over-expressed by at least  <dig> fold in osteocytes with a fdr-corrected p-value <  <dig>  .

using the david functional annotation tool  <cit> , we found that the  <dig> osteocyte-specific genes are significantly enriched in several go terms, which are further grouped into several functional clusters . as expected, the most significant clusters include go terms such as "extracellular region", "ossification", "bone remodelling" and "system development". interestingly, our results also showed that osteocytes express many genes and transcription factors  known to control muscle differentiation and contractility. for example, over  <dig> myosin-related genes are over-expressed in osteocytes, as well as several tfs such as myogenin, mef2c, and myf <dig> 

 <dig> over-expressed in osteocyte cells were input into the david bioinformatics tool for functional annotation clustering. sample clusters and their top two protein information resource  and go terms are provided here, with cluster  <dig> relating to bone and cluster  <dig> relating to muscle.

conserved cis-regulatory elements in osteocyte-specific genes
to study the transcription regulation of the osteocyte-specific genes, we combined the  <dig> genes in the bone- and muscle-related functional clusters and analyzed the cis-regulatory elements occurring on their promoters. using the web tool whole genome vista   <cit> , we searched for known tf binding motifs that are conserved between the mouse and human genomes from the  <dig> kb promoter sequence upstream to the transcription starting site for each gene. as expected, many motifs identified are known to be related to bone and muscle functions, including myf <dig>  ets family, smad <dig> sites, and foxo1/ <dig> cis-elements. strikingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes had  <dig> or more conserved mef <dig> binding sites in their  <dig> kb promoter regions. furthermore, mef2c is also a direct target of mef <dig> with over  <dig> conserved binding sites, suggesting that this gene regulates itself .

modular structure of the transcriptional regulatory network

in order to identify possible combinatorial affects of tf binding sites, we created a transcriptional regulatory network including the  <dig> over-expressed genes and the known tf binding sites that are not only conserved between mouse and human, but are also determined by wgv to be enriched in some genes . this increases the reliability of edges, while reducing the network size to a management size. a total of  <dig> over-represented tf motifs were identified for the  <dig> gene set. we created a network of these genes and tfs, with edges between genes and tfs representing an over-representation of that tf's binding site on that gene. we next applied qcut  <cit> , a spectral-based graph clustering algorithm for finding relatively dense subnetworks , to this initial regulatory network . by optimizing a statistical score called the modularity, the qcut function can determine by itself the most appropriate number of communities in the network. we identified  <dig> communities, each containing some genes that share a large set of common tf binding sites ). cluster  <dig> shows a strong community between  <dig> genes and their common tf binding sites, which is representative of many tfs coordinately regulating a small set of genes ). cluster  <dig> shows potential co-regulation of mef2c, myf <dig> and irx <dig> by a common set of tfs ).

a putative model of the transcriptional network
a proposed regulatory network model  has been created using our network results and our prior biological knowledge. the model demonstrates the regulation of dmp <dig> and sost, two genes highly expressed in osteocytes, by mef2c and myogenin. it is also observed that mef2c contains a high level of mef2c binding sites, suggesting that this gene regulates itself. these putative models can be used to generate hypotheses for experimental validation. we now have an ex vivo culture system for pure osteocytes in their proper microenvironment in which they make appropriate levels of osteocyte specific genes, and experiments from this model are currently underway.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we introduced a systems biology method for identifying and analyzing transcriptional regulatory networks in the osteocyte. we integrated data from microarray experiments, functional annotations, comparative genomics, and graph-theoretic analysis to create a putative model of the transcriptional regulatory networks in osteocytes. many parts of the network can be confirmed by the literature, and more direct experimental validations are underway. our model shows that many osteocyte-specific genes, including two well-known osteocyte markers dmp <dig> and sost, have highly conserved clustering of muscle-related cis-regulatory modules, thus supporting the concept that a muscle-related gene network is important in osteocyte biology and may play a role in contractility and dynamic movements of the osteocyte.
