BACKGROUND
in response to environmental stresses, plants have evolved an impressive diversity of chemical defenses  <cit> . in particular, plant specialized metabolites involved in protection against insect herbivores can function as feeding deterrents, antinutritive factors or toxins to protect plant tissues or act as cues to attract natural enemies of plant pests  <cit> . synthesizing and maintaining these defense metabolites, such as glucosinolates , is costly and plants must efficiently balance the trade-off between growth and defense . however the current picture might change as atmospheric carbon dioxide  levels are predicted to rise dramatically, doubling by the end of the century  <cit> . according to the scripps research institute , monthly mean co <dig> concentrations have reached 400 ppm and are predicted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change to reach 880 ppm by  <dig> . co <dig> enrichment is known to promote photosynthetic and nitrogen use efficiency, particularly in c <dig> plants, through an increase in the rate of co <dig> fixation. even though, as a consequence, plants are predicted to be more tolerant to nitrogen deficiency, there also may be limitations in readily available nitrogen fertilizers due to increasing production costs. this problem may be exacerbated in countries with limited access to costly farming inputs  <cit> . therefore, global changes in atmospheric co <dig> levels combined with potential limitations of nitrogen fertilizers will alter plant nutrient patterns in agricultural fields.

understanding how plants adapt to these rapidly changing environmental conditions still remains a challenge  <cit> . the recent availability of unbiased metabolite profiling to simultaneously measure hundreds of metabolites in plant tissues combined with analysis of underlying metabolic pathways are valuable tools to evaluate metabolic shifts in response to changing environmental conditions to determine the potential impact of nutrient availability on plant defenses  <cit> . in the first part of this study, an unbiased, exploratory approach was used to gain a “global” view of metabolite profile in vegetative arabidopsis thaliana  heynh.  plants that were grown under conditions of ambient or elevated co <dig> and fertilized by 1 mm or 10 mm nitrate 440 ppm vs 880 ppm. rosette leaves were wounded and changes in metabolite profile were also monitored.

thale cress, arabidopsis thaliana, is a fast-growing herbaceous plant  <cit> . like most plants in the order brassicales, the main group of specialized metabolites produced by a. thaliana are glucosinolates . these nitrogen- and sulfur-rich compounds are constitutively present in plant tissues and their biosynthesis is stimulated by biotic stress and mechanical wounding  <cit> . the second part of the study focused on gsl biosynthesis in response to co <dig> and nitrate fertilization.

the basic gsl structure is an s-glycosylated thiohydroximate sulfate ester linked to an amino acid derived side chain  <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana produces ~ <dig> different gsls that are classified as aliphatic or indole based on the nature of the amino acid precursor  <cit> . six r2r3-type myb transcription factors regulate gsl biosynthesis  <cit>  . myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> regulate the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in indole gsl biosynthesis  <cit> . these three myb transcription factors show some degree of functional redundancy and tissue-specific expression patterns  <cit> ; myb <dig> and myb <dig> are predominantly associated with the root tissues, whereas myb <dig> is found in leaves  <cit> . myb <dig> positively regulates genes involved in the biosynthesis of trp and indole-3-acetic acid as well as genes encoding cytochrome p <dig> enzymes cyp79b2/ <dig> and cyp83b <dig> in the gsl biosynthetic pathway. overexpression of atmyb <dig> leads to the accumulation of glucobrassicin , the most abundant indole gsl in arabidopsis  <cit> . overexpression of atmyb <dig> results in the accumulation of indole alkaloids and results in reduced consumption of leaves by caterpillars of the beet armyworm spodoptera exigua  <cit> . in comparison, myb <dig> has a minor but complementary role in indole gsl biosynthesis  <cit> .

in contrast, myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> positively regulate aliphatic gsl biosynthesis  <cit> . myb <dig> induces the expression of mam1/ <dig>  cyp79f <dig> and st5b/c transcripts that encode enzymes in the aliphatic gsl pathway. myb <dig> induces the accumulation of short-chain gsls and may serve as an integrator of signals from myb <dig> and myb <dig>  as it is upregulated by both these transcription factors and has a direct inhibitory effect on myb <dig>  <cit> . double myb28/myb <dig> mutants lacking aliphatic gsls had significantly reduced resistance to the generalist herbivore mamestra brassicae  <cit> . myb <dig> is believed to play a minor role in the regulation of aliphatic gsl biosynthesis as atmyb <dig> mutants have similar gsl profiles to those of wildtype plants  <cit> . sønderby et al.  <cit>  reported that myb <dig> overexpression leads to an increase in long-chained gsls. myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> function antagonistically and repress expression of myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> transcripts  <cit> . how expression of these six key myb transcription factors that regulate gsl biosynthesis are affected by elevated co <dig> conditions and nitrate availability is unknown.

the impact of elevated atmospheric co <dig> on gsl accumulation has been assessed in several brassicaceae species. karowe et al.  <cit>  found that a shift in gsl levels was not correlated to the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of plant tissues as this ratio increased in the tissues of all plant species tested while foliar gsls increased, decreased or remained unchanged in a stage- and species-specific manner. other studies have either found no difference in gsl content or slight changes in the concentrations of a few compounds between plants grown under ambient or elevated co <dig> levels . bidart-bouzat et al.  <cit>  reported a co <dig> x herbivory effect in arabidopsis ecotypes cvi-o and edi-o; a. thaliana plants with lower constitutive defenses accumulate significantly more gsls after damage by caterpillars of the diamondback moth plutella xylostella under elevated co <dig> levels. in comparison, gsls remained unchanged in herbivore-attacked plants grown under ambient co <dig> levels.

given that these are nitrogen- and sulfur-rich plant metabolites, the influence of nitrogen availability on gsl biosynthesis has mainly been studied in relation to plant sulfur status in brassicaceous plants. brassica oleracea var. capitata accumulates more gsls when grown under nitrogen-limited conditions  <cit> . in comparison, in brassica rapa nitrogen stress led to an overall reduction in gsl accumulation in plants receiving adequate sulfur fertilization  <cit> . in. b. oleracea var italica  changing nitrogen fertilization rates had a non-linear effect on foliar gsl profiles, suggesting that nitrogen stress favours the synthesis of gbc  <cit> . in contrast, b. oleracea var. alboglabra  plants suffering nitrogen stress had higher total gsl levels than those receiving adequate or excess nitrogen fertilization under ambient co <dig> conditions   <cit> . elevating co <dig> levels to 800 ppm results in a greater increase in aliphatic and total gsls in nitrogen-derived plants than in adequately fertilized plants suggesting a significant co <dig> x nitrogen interaction. moreover, the increase in carbon-to-nitrogen ratio under co <dig> enrichment did not lead to depressed gsl levels in bolting stems  <cit> .

mechanical damage activates hormone-associated signaling pathways that modulate gene expression and lead to the production of specialized metabolites  <cit> . key wound-activated octadecanoid signaling molecules are 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid , jasmonic acid  and the biologically active form of ja, 7-jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine   <cit> ; cellular increases in these hormones lead to wound-induced plant responses  <cit> . changes in abscisic acid  levels are also often observed in response to wounding, possibly as a response to water losses at the site of damage  <cit> . in contrast, constitutive salicylic acid  levels increase as part of the hypersensitive response to pathogens leading to systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . between all these hormones, there can be cross-talk between signaling pathways that modify the final metabolic response  <cit>  .

mechanical wounding activates the expression of myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig> and cyp79b2/ <dig>  <cit> . however, there is limited information on the effects of wounding on gsl levels. higher levels of indole gsls, gbc and 4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethyl-gsl , were found after wounding or feeding by crucifer specialist flea beetle phyllotreta cruciferae damage of b. napus cv. ‘tobin’ and b. juncea cv. ‘cutlass’ compared to b. napus cv. ‘westar’ where only gbc levels increased  <cit> . in contrast, wounding did not affect gsl levels in sinapis alba cv. ‘ochre’ cotyledons, but this species has higher constitutive gsl levels compared to other plant species. in a. thaliana, foliar indole gsl levels  increased 24 h after damage by ribbed forceps  <cit> . in comparison, levels of aliphatic gsls  and indole gsls  increased after methyl jasmonate treatment.

bidart-bouzat and imeh-nathaniel  <cit>  stress the need to study co2-dependent changes in stress-induced foliar defense metabolites profiles as they could provide valuable predictions on future plant-herbivore interaction patterns. as nitrogen supply is known to affect plant responses to co <dig> enrichment  <cit> , these two factors need to be studied simultaneously to accurately predict the outcome of increasing atmospheric co <dig> changes on plant defense mechanisms. the aim of this project is to evaluate the combined effects of co <dig> enrichment and nitrate levels on metabolite levels in mechanically damaged a. thaliana leaves. a non-targeted approach using liquid chromatography-quadrapole time-of-flight mass spectrometry  was used to explore overall patterns of foliar metabolites occurring in response to these environmental stresses  <cit> . this was followed by a focused study on the foliar phytohormone and gsl transcription factor expression and levels. in response to plant damage , a shift from aliphatic to indole gsls is often observed  <cit> . therefore, we measured the expression of key myb transcription factors involved in the regulation of gsl biosynthesis. in arabidopsis, mechanical damage induces the expression of myb <dig> and myb <dig>  responsible for the regulation of genes encoding enzymes in the aliphatic gsl pathway, as well as myb  <dig>  responsible for the regulation of genes encoding enzymes in the indole gsl pathway  <cit> . these two pathways are antagonistic; myb factors in the indole pathway are believed to downregulate the aliphatic pathway and vice versa  <cit> .

methods
plant growth conditions
arabidopsis thaliana ) seeds were cold stratified at 4 °c for two days to obtain a constant germination rate  <cit> . after sowing in 16 cm pots containing fafard pv <dig> agromix, pots were transferred to one of two growth cabinets  under ambient  or elevated  co <dig>  after two weeks, seedlings were transferred to pots and randomly assigned to one of the two fertilization groups; the first set was subjected to nitrogen stress  and the second group was given sufficient nitrate . to make up these fertilizers, concentrations of all other components were the same with the exception of cl−; the difference in cl− concentration is considered insignificant as it is at a supra-optimal level and below potentially toxic levels  <cit> ; cl− was approximately 9 mm higher in the nitrogen-stressed plants. plants were fertilized every two days with watering.

wound treatment and sample collection
at approximately 6 weeks , half of the plants for each treatment were randomly selected to be mechanically damaged; approximately 20 % of each rosette leaf in the mechanically wounded treatment was removed using a hole punch. to minimize volatile signalling between different groups of plants, a plexiglass panel was placed between wounded and control plants. after 24 h, the entire rosette was harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c until subsequent analysis. for hormone, gene expression, gsl and untargeted metabolomic analyses, two biological replicates were taken and the experiment was temporally repeated .

untargeted metabolite extraction and mass spectrometry
metabolite extraction and analysis was conducted as described by de vos et al.  <cit> . lyophilized leaf samples were finely ground using a tissuelyzer  and metabolites extracted in 75 % aqueous methanol  acidified with  <dig>  % formic acid . following vigorous vortexing  and sonication , samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 10 min and the supernatants transferred to clean tubes. supernatants were then filtered through  <dig>  μm ptfe syringe filters and transferred to hplc vials.

metabolite separation and identification was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography  interfaced with a quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer  at the high resolution mass spectrometry facility at the university of iowa. randomized samples were separated on a c <dig>  column using a gradient solvent at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min; the mobile phase was increased from 5 % acetonitrile  with  <dig>  % formic acid to 75 % acn with  <dig>  % formic acid over 20 min, 75 % acn with  <dig>  formic acid was maintained for 5 min and then acn levels were lowered to initial conditions over 1 min and re-equilibrated for 4 min. column temperature was maintained at 40 °c. for ms detection, negative mode electrospray ionization  was used and data were collected in the centroid mode following the procedure described by de vos et al.  <cit> . full scan mass spectra for the ions in the mass range of 100–1500 da were collected every 900 ms with an interscan delay of 100 ms.

liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  processing and metabolite identification
data pre-processing and alignment was performed with mzmine program   <cit> . briefly, raw data from the waters q-tof-ms were converted to net cdf format. in mzmine, data were filtered using the savitzky-gravity filter, then base-corrected and peaks were detected in the centroid mode. the chromatogram was built using a  <dig>  m/z tolerance and deconvoluted using the algorithm “local minimum search”. peaks were aligned using the “join aligner” algorithm allowing 100 ppm m/z tolerance and followed by gap filling . changes in metabolite levels  were analyzed using metaboanalyst  <dig>  . within each treatment , data were analyzed as 2-factor independent samples. data were filtered using an interquantile range  and log-transformed and auto-scaled  to normalize the data. an overview of the data was then observed using principal component analysis  and heatmaps to understand global patterns.

phytohormone extraction and analysis
lyophilized and finely ground foliar tissues were sent to the proteomics and mass spectrometry facility at the danforth plant science center  for the analysis of phytohormone  levels by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. plant samples were spiked with deuterium-labelled internal standards of sa , aba , and ja  and extracted in ice cold meoh:acn . following centrifugation , the supernatants were collected and pellet extraction was repeated. the pooled supernatants were evaporated using a speed-vac and the resulting pellet redissolved in 30 % meoh.

phytohormone analysis was performed using a c <dig> column . separation was achieved using a mobile gradient of 40 % solvent a  to 100 % solvent b  over 5 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min− <dig>  a 4000-qtrap  was used to obtain the mass spectra using parameters set as follows: esi in the negative mode , capillary voltage − <dig>  nebulizer gas   <dig> arbitrary units , heater gas 50 a.u., curtain gas 25 a.u., collision activation dissociation high, temperature 550 °c. compounds were detected using multiple reaction monitoring transitions that were optimized for each phytohormone and deuterium-labelled standards  <cit> . concentrations were determined from standard curves of known compounds.

glucosinolate  extraction and analysis
gsls were extracted and analyzed following van dam et al.  <cit> . briefly, 50 mg of lyophilized leaf material was finely ground using a tissuelyser. following incubation at 90 °c for 6 min to inactivate plant myrosinases, samples were ultra-sonicated for 15 min in 70 % meoh. after centrifugation at 2975 g for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and the pellet was re-extracted. supernatants were pooled and cleaned up using a diethylaminoentyl sephadex a- <dig> ion exchange column preconditioned with sterile milliq water. after washing with 70 % meoh , milliq water  and 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, ph  <dig>  , gsls were treated with  <dig> u of arylsulfatase and incubated at rt for 12 h. the desulfated gsls were eluted in sterile milliq water  and the eluants were lyophilized.

gsl extracts were separated by high performance liquid chromatography . compounds were separated on a reverse-phase c <dig> column  using a mobile gradient from 2 % acn to 35 % acn in 30 min at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml min− <dig>  compounds were detected by a photodiode array detector  at 229 nm . gsls were identified based on retention time, uv spectra and mass spectra. reference standards of gsls , glucoerucin , progoitrin , sinigrin , gluconapin , glucobrassicanapin , glucobrassicin , sinalbin , glucotropaeolin , and gluconasturtiin ; phytoplan, heidelberg, germany) were employed as standards in the hplc analysis. correction factors were used to calculate gsl concentrations from an external sinigrin standard curve .

gene expression analysis
total rna was extracted from leaf tissue samples using an rneasy plant mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. rna quality and concentration were determined spectrophotometrically . the absence of dna contamination was verified by polymerase chain reaction  using primers designed against an intronic region of ethylene-insensitive-like <dig>    <cit> . pcr amplicons were separated on a 1 % gel. genomic dna was included as a positive control.

the relative transcript expression of myb transcription factors involved in gsl biosynthesis  was measured by quantitative real time-pcr  using absolute blue sybr green with low rox . the qrt-pcr reaction contained  <dig> x sybr green, cdna  and  <dig> nm of gene-specific forward and reverse primers . the thermal cycling program was: 95 °c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s, 58-60 °c for 30 s  and 72 °c for 30 s. the presence of a single amplicon was confirmed by a sharp dissociation curve. samples were analyzed in duplicate and two technical plates were performed. non-template controls were included on every plate.

the relative expression of the target genes was calculated as a ratio  to the geometric mean of two reference genes  where the initial template concentration, r <dig>  was calculated using the formula r0 = 1/ct where e is the average efficiency of gene in the exponential phase and ct is the threshold cycle  <cit> .

statistical analysis
for hormone, gene expression and gsl analyses, statistically significant differences  were identified by conducting a 3-factorial analysis of variance  using spss . when significant interactions were detected, differences were further teased apart by the appropriate 2-way anova . the effect of mechanical damage was determined by comparing constitutive vs wounded levels using a student’s t-test.

RESULTS
global changes in arabidopsis foliar metabolite profile
in arabidopsis, the constitutive foliar metabolite profile of plants grown at lower nitrate fertilization levels  strongly reflects atmospheric co <dig> levels . pca analysis segregates constitutive metabolites in plants grown under ambient or elevated co <dig> levels in nitrate-limited plants. this stark differentiation between metabolite profiles was absent when plants were fertilized by 10 mm nitrate. in response to mechanical wounding, induced metabolic profiles are affected by atmospheric co <dig> levels and nitrate fertilization . at ambient co <dig> levels, wound-induced metabolite profiles are similar, regardless of nitrate fertilization . this same general pattern is seen in plants grown at elevated co <dig> under nitrate-limited conditions. a strikingly different wound-induced metabolite profile is seen in plants grown at elevated co <dig> and high nitrate fertilization  . at elevated co <dig> levels, the strong difference in induced metabolite profile observed in plants fertilized with 1 mm nitrate is not as pronounced in plants fertilized with the higher nitrate level .fig.  <dig> principal component analysis  of foliar metabolite profiles of arabidopsis grown at different levels of co <dig>  nitrate fertilization and wounding stress. plants were grown under two different atmospheric co <dig> levels  or elevated ) and fertilized with either 1 mm or 10 mm nitrate and either not treated  or mechanically damaged . the average of  <dig> independent samples were compared by 2-way analysis of variance. a constitutive foliar metabolic profile. the purple shaded area denotes constitutive metabolites extracted from plants fertilized by 1 mm nitrate and grown at ambient co <dig> compared to the red shaded area denotes constitutive metabolites extracted from plants grown at elevated co <dig> levels. b wound-induced metabolite profile. the red shaded area denotes metabolites extracted plants fertilized with 10 mm nitrate and grown under elevated atmospheric co <dig>  c metabolite profile of plants grown at ambient co <dig> levels . the blue shaded area denotes constitutive metabolites extracted from plants fertilized by 1 mm nitrate. d metabolite profile of plants grown at elevated co <dig> levels . blue shaded area denotes constitutive metabolites compared to the green shaded area that denotes wound-induced metabolites extracted from plants fertilized with 1 mm nitrate. the red shaded area denotes constitutive and wound-induced metabolites extracted from plants fertilized with 10 mm nitrate. e metabolite profile of plants fertilized with 1 mm nitrate. the purple shaded area denotes constitutive metabolites extracted from plants grown at ambient co <dig> levels compared to the red shaded are that denotes constitutive metabolites extracted from plants grown at elevated atmospheric co <dig>  f metabolite profile of plants fertilized with 10 mm nitrate. green circle denotes wound-induced metabolites extracted from plants grown at ambient co <dig> levels



under elevated co <dig> conditions, the jasmonate burst is limited by nitrate excess
under ambient and elevated co <dig> levels, ja and ja-ile levels, representing a strong jasmonate burst, increase in response to wounding . at elevated co <dig> levels, an enhanced ja burst is observed in wounded plants that are subject to the lower nitrogen fertilization regime  ; this is over three times the level of ja induced in plants fertilized by 10 mm nitrate. a similar but more striking increase is observed in the biologically active form of ja, ja-ile, where, under conditions of elevated co <dig>  a 12-fold difference in induced ja-ile level is observed between plants fertilized with 1 mm or 10 mm nitrate . therefore, nitrate fertilization dampens the wound-induced jasmonate response in plants grown under elevated co <dig>  sun et al.  <cit>  also observed that arabidopsis plants grown at elevated atmospheric co <dig> levels showed a decline in jasmonate-dependent defenses in response to attack by the peach aphid, myzus persicae. increases in the level of the signaling molecule and biosynthetic precursor to ja, opda, is only observed in mechanically damaged plants fertilized with 1 mm nitrate, regardless of the co <dig> environment .fig.  <dig> foliar phytohormones in arabidopsis grown at different levels of co <dig>  nitrate fertilization and wounding stress. plants were grown under ambient  or elevated  carbon dioxide  levels and fertilized with either 1 mm or 10 mm nitrate . at 6 weeks, arabidopsis rosette leaves were mechanically damaged  or untouched  and phytohormone levels analyzed. a jasmonic acid  b 7-jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine  c 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid . statistical differences were determined by 3-factor analysis of variance . when interactions were significant, data were separated to show treatment effects. significant differences in response to wounding are denoted by alphabetical letters . an asterisk indicates significant differences between grouped variables



glucosinolate biosynthesis and levels
the key arabidopsis defensive compounds, gsls, are nitrogen-rich compounds, therefore, co <dig> enrichment and nitrogen-limitation may influence their biosynthesis and levels and, ultimately, influence plant resistance to herbivory. focusing on myb tfs that regulate aliphatic gsl biosynthesis, atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  3-way anova analyses detected an induction in response to wounding but this was often not identified by student’s t-test . expression of atmyb <dig> reflects nitrate and atmospheric co <dig> conditions ; arabidopsis grown under higher atmospheric co <dig> levels have increased atmyb <dig> transcript levels when plants are fertilized at a higher nitrate rate. overall, these results suggest that in response to wounding of plants grown at elevated co <dig>  one might expect an increase in aliphatic gsl levels.fig.  <dig> foliar myb transcription factor gene expression in arabidopsis grown at different levels of co <dig>  nitrate fertilization and wounding stress. arabidopsis plants were grown under ambient  or elevated  carbon dioxide  levels and fertilized with either 1 mm or 10 mm nitrate . at 6 weeks, rosette leaves were mechanically damaged  or untouched . expression of transcription factors that regulate glucosinolate biosynthesis a) atmyb28
b) atmyb29
c) atmyb76
d) atmyb <dig> and e) atmyb <dig>  statistical differences were determined by 3-factor analysis of variance . when interactions were significant , data were separated to show treatment effects. in co <dig> levels and nitrate fertilization treatments, only significant changes in gene expression are highlighted. significant differences in response to treatments are denoted by alphabetical letters



overall, a significant increase in total foliar levels of aliphatic gsls was not observed in response to these treatments . in fact, a decrease in aliphatic glucosinolates is observed in wounded plants grown under elevated co <dig> conditions and high fertilization. this was unexpected given the expression of the myb transcription factors known to regulate aliphatic gsl biosynthesis and points to the possible multiple levels of regulation of aliphatic gsl biosynthesis as proposed by burows et al.  <cit> . a closer inspection of specific aliphatic gsls shows that levels of the aliphatic 3c class 3-methylsulfinylpropyl gsl glucoiberin  and 4c class 4-methylsulfinylbutyl gsl glucoraphanin  are lower in wounded, nitrate-fertilized plants grown at elevated co <dig> levels .fig.  <dig> foliar glucosinolate levels in arabidopsis grown at different levels of co <dig>  nitrate fertilization and wounding stress. plants were grown under ambient  or elevated  carbon dioxide  levels and fertilized with either 1 mm or 10 mm nitrate . at 6 weeks, rosette leaves were mechanically damaged  or untouched . a total glucosinolates, white bars represent aliphatic gsls and hatched bars represent indole gsls. significant differences  in response to wounding of aliphatic gsls are denoted inside the white bar, of indole gsls are denoted inside the hatched bar and total gsls are denoted on top of the bar by alphabetical letters. b aliphatic glucosinolates bi) glucoiberin , bii) glucoerucin , biii) glucoraphanin  and biv) d) glucoalyssin . c indole glucosinolates ci) glucobrassicin , cii) neo-glucobrassicin  and ciii) methoxyglucobrassicin . statistical differences were determined by 3-factor analysis of variance . when interactions were significant, data were separated to show treatment effects. significant differences in response to wounding are denoted by alphabetical letters . an asterisk indicates significant differences between grouped variables



aliphatic glucosinolate levels show strong nitrate fertilization x atmospheric co <dig> interaction. in plants grown at ambient co <dig>  levels of the 4c class 4-methylthiobutyl gsl glucoerucin  are lower than in plants grown at higher co <dig> levels . unexpectedly, for ibe and the 5c class 5-methylsulfinylpentyl gsl glucoalyssin , higher levels of these compounds were observed under lower nitrate fertilization rates in plants grown at ambient co <dig> conditions . in contrast, in arabidopsis plants grown under enriched co <dig> conditions, nitrate fertilization has a positive effect on eru levels and negatively effects aly levels .

atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb  <dig> regulate indole gsl biosynthesis  <cit> ; atmyb <dig> plays the predominant role in regulating foliar indole gsl biosynthesis in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . expression of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> is higher in plants grown at elevated co <dig> levels . in comparison with previous reports  <cit> , atmyb <dig> is not strongly induced in response to mechanical damage ; wound-induced atmyb <dig> expression was only observed in plants fertilized with 10 mm nitrate grown at ambient co <dig> levels. expression of both atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> was higher in plants grown under elevated co <dig> conditions . atmyb <dig> expression levels were below the detection limits used in this experiment.

unlike aliphatic gsls, atmospheric co <dig> rather than a co <dig> x nitrate interaction appears to play a greater role in influencing indole gsl levels. increased foliar levels of 4-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl gsl  and 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl gsl  levels and lower levels of their biosynthetic precursor 3-indolylmethyl gsl  are observed in arabidopsis grown under elevated co <dig> conditions ; this suggests increased flux toward methoxy-indolyl gsls under enriched co <dig> levels. total foliar indole gsl levels increase in response to wounding under all environmental conditions except in plants grown under nitrogen- and co2-fertilization . in particular, gbc levels are strongly induced in response to mechanical damage . neogb levels are induced only when plants are grown under nitrogen-stressed conditions .

CONCLUSIONS
atmospheric co <dig> levels and nitrate fertilization play an important role in shaping the constitutive and wound-induced metabolic profile in arabidopsis leaves. constitutive metabolic profiles reflect atmospheric co <dig> levels, particularly under nitrate-limited conditions . in contrast, at elevated co <dig>  wound-inducible metabolites show a distinct profile in response to high nitrate fertilization . in fact, the enhanced jasmonate burst observed in wounded arabidopsis grown under an enriched co <dig> atmosphere is suppressed in plants fertilized with the higher rate of nitrate . this is also reflected in gsl levels . wound-induced levels of the indole gsl gbc and neogb are observed , although the increased levels of neogb are only seen in nitrate-limited plants. as well, a wound-related reduction in the aliphatic gsls ibe and raph is observed in plants grown in enriched co <dig> and nitrate conditions .

one possible explanation for these results is that under elevated atmospheric co <dig> levels, as photorespiration decreases in c <dig> plants, cytosolic malate, an important source of reducing power  for nitrate assimilation, also decreases  <cit> . if the readily available nadph is used for nitrate assimilation, then this may affect the cellular redox balance and the plants’ ability to respond to stresses, such as mechanical damage, may be impaired  <cit> . we are presently further investigating this possibility. results from this study suggest that changing atmospheric conditions and nitrate fertilization may affect the plant’s ability to identify and cope with oxidative stress, such as in response to insect damage  <cit> , and, therefore, has important implications for future agricultural management practices for c <dig> crops.
