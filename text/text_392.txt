BACKGROUND
globins are heme-containing proteins that bind o <dig> and other gaseous ligands between the iron atom at the center of the porphyrin ring and a histidine residue of their polypeptide chain  <cit> . in addition to supporting aerobic metabolism of cells by providing o <dig> supply, globins fulfill a broad range of other functions, including o <dig> sensing, detoxification of harmful reactive oxygen species , the generation of bioactive gas molecules like no and others  <cit> . thus it is not surprising that the versatile globins are found from bacteria to fungi, protists, plants, and most animal groups  <cit> .

the intensively studied hemoglobins  and myoglobins  are present in almost all vertebrate species, being responsible for o <dig> transport and storage, but also the production and elimination of no  <cit> . some years ago, the vertebrate globin gene family was expanded by the discovery of two additional globin types, neuroglobin and cytoglobin  <cit> . neuroglobin  is preferentially expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, and its expression patterns suggest an association with oxidative metabolism and the presence of mitochondria  <cit> . cytoglobin  is expressed in fibroblast-related cell types and distinct neuronal cell populations  <cit> . the exact physiological function of both proteins are still uncertain, and several, partially contradictory hypotheses have been proposed, including functions in o <dig> supply, ros detoxification, signal transduction and inhibition of apoptosis  <cit> . in the biomedical field, ngb and cygb have created considerable interest because these proteins appear to convey protection to cells and organs, e.g. after ischemia/reperfusion injury of the brain  <cit> .

due to the high number of available sequences, globins have become a popular model for the investigation of gene and gene family evolution  <cit> . in vertebrates, there are multiple α-hb and β-hb genes, which form distinct clusters. in birds and mammals, the α-hb and β-hb gene loci are found on separate chromosomes, while these loci are joined in fish and amphibians  <cit> . mb, ngb and cygb, however, are typically single copy genes that are not associated with any other globin locus. molecular phylogenetic studies and genomic comparisons may permit more refined insights into the function of ngb and cygb. both of these proteins and genes are subject to strong purifying selection in all vertebrates studied so far, suggesting an essential cellular role  <cit> . phylogenetic trees have shown that ngb is distantly related to nerve hemoglobins in invertebrate worms, suggesting that its function is required in nerve cells of prototomian and deuterostomian animals, which diverged more than  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . cygb, however, is a paralog of the muscle-specific mb and may have been created by a duplication event only after the separation of agnathan and gnathostomian vertebrates about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in addition to the widespread ngb and cygb, some vertebrate lineages possess specific additional globin variants of unknown function, named globin ×  in fish and frogs, globin y  in frogs, lizards, and monotreme mammals and globin e  in birds  <cit> . to evaluate the resulting scenarios of vertebrate globin evolution, and to identify important, evolutionary conserved protein structure and ligand binding characteristics of human ngb and cygb, it is mandatory to identify and study candidate globin orthologs in non-vertebrate taxa.

in the 'new deuterostome phylogeny'  <cit> , urochordates  appear to be the closest relatives to vertebrates, while the cephalochordate amphioxus , believed for a long time to be the vertebrate sister taxon, now appears to be basal to the vertebrate/tunicate clade. we have previously reported the globin gene repertoire of the tunicate ciona intestinalis , consisting of at least four globins, clustered in a monophyletic clade. these genes are about equally distantly related to the vertebrate ngb and gbx lineage, so that no clear orthology could be established  <cit> . in cephalochordates, the existence of a globin protein in notochord cells and myotome tissue of branchiostoma californiense and b. floridae has been demonstrated by biochemical studies  <cit> . this intracellular globin is a dimer consisting of  <dig> kda subunits with a high o <dig> affinity . because of this high affinity and the absence of cooperativity, a possible role of the globins in facilitating diffusion of o <dig> into the notochord cells was discussed  <cit> . however, recent publications based on the genome sequence of b. floridae have yielded no hint at the presence of globin genes in this most basal chordate taxon  <cit> . to address this shortcoming, here we report the genomic organization of b. floridae globin genes  and their evolutionary implications.

methods
database searches and sequence analyses
blast searches  <cit>  were performed on whole genome shotgun data from the ncbi trace archive  <cit>  and the branchiostoma floridae genome project versions  <dig>  and  <dig>  at the jgi  <cit> . searches of expressed sequence tags  were performed using the b. floridae cdna resource  <cit>  and the ncbi est database  <cit> . nucleotide sequences were extracted from databases, assembled and translated using the dnastar  <dig>  program package .

pairwise percentage sequence identities and similarities of proteins were calculated using the matrix global alignment tool  version  <dig>   <cit>  using a pam <dig> scoring matrix. dotplots for detecting repeat structures were made using zpicture  <cit> . prediction of subcellular localization of proteins was done by psort ii  <cit> . n-myristoylation sites were predicted by myristoylater  <cit> .

molecular phylogeny
the conceptionally translated amino acid sequences of the b. floridae globins were manually added to an alignment of selected globin sequences  <cit> . the sequences used are homo sapiens neuroglobin , cytoglobin , myoglobin , hemoglobin α , and hb β ; mus musculus ngb , cygb  and mb ; ornithorhynchus anatinus gby , gbe ; taeniopygia guttata gbe ; xenopus tropicalis gbx , hb α , hb β , gby ; xenopus laevis gby ; danio rerio ngb , gbx , cygb <dig> , mb ; carassius auratus gbx ; myxine glutinosa hb <dig> , hb <dig> ; lampetra fluviatilis hb ; medicago sativa leghemoglobin ; lupinus luteus leghemoglobin ; casuarina glauca hb <dig> . in our deuterostome globin analysis, we refrained from inclusion of protostome globin sequences, because these tend to behave polyphyletically in the tree , possibly due to long-branch attraction artifacts. our trees were therefore rooted by plant globin sequences.

phylogenetic tree reconstructions were performed using mrbayes version  <dig>   <cit>  using the wag model of amino acid evolution  <cit>  assuming a gamma distribution of rates, as suggested by analysis of the alignment with prottest version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . metropolis-coupled markov chain monte carlo sampling was performed with one cold and three heated chains that were run for up to  <dig> , <dig> generations. trees were sampled every 10th generation and 'burn in' was set to  <dig> . maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis was performed by raxml version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  assuming the wag model and gamma distribution of substitution rates. the resulting tree was tested by bootstrapping with  <dig> replicates.

rt-pcr confirmation of b. floridae globin coding sequences
adult specimens of b. floridae were collected at tampa bay, florida, usa. total rna was isolated from whole animals using the rneasy kit according to the supplier's instructions . to remove genomic dna a dnase i digestion step was included in the preparation. reverse transcription of  <dig>  μg total rna was performed using superscript ii reverse transcriptase  with an oligo primer. using one-tenth of a cdna reaction and  <dig> u taq dna polymerase  the complete or partial coding sequences of the bioinformatically predicted globin genes were amplified in a standard pcr protocol. missing 5' and 3' regions were obtained using the generacer kit with superscript iii reverse transcriptase . pcr products were sequenced directly or were cloned into the pgem-teasy vector system  and both strands were sequenced by a commercial sequencing service . nucleotide sequences were deposited in the database under the accession numbers listed in table  <dig> 

gene models, corresponding haplotypes, identities and similarities of haplotype proteins, nucleotide evolution rates of haplotypes, evidence for gene expression by ests and accession numbers of cdna sequences are listed.

recombinant globin expression and characterization
amphioxus globin variant bflgb <dig> coding sequence was isolated by rt-pcr, cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pet15b, verified by re-sequencing and ultimately expressed and affinity-purified from e. coli bl21plys host cells by a ni-nta superflow column . the kinetics of ligand binding by the flash photolysis method was measured to determine functional properties of the bflgb <dig> globin. after photolysis of the co form, the subsequent completion of rebinding of the co and any internal protein ligands provides information on the association and dissociation rates. samples of  <dig> μm protein, on a heme basis, were placed under a controlled atmosphere of co, oxygen or a mixture of both ligands, and photolyzed with  <dig> ns pulses at  <dig> nm.

RESULTS
identification and annotation of b. floridae globin genes
systematic tblastn searches were carried out on the database of the b. floridae genome project versions  <dig>  and  <dig>  at the jgi  <cit>  and the branchiostoma cdna resource  <cit>  and complemented with the data of the whole genome shotgun sequences at the ncbi trace archive. using vertebrate ngb and cygb sequences as query, fifteen distinct bona fide globin genes were identified in branchiostoma genome v.  <dig> , which reports a single haplotype at each locus  <cit>  . this is substantially more than the four gene copies identified in the tunicate c. intestinalis  <cit>  but less than the largest globin gene families known from invertebrates . the reason for the higher globin gene copy number in branchiostoma vs. ciona is unknown. it may reflect differences in life-style  and/or the threefold higher genome size in amphioxus compared to the tunicate, which is thought to have undergone substantial gene loss  <cit> . eight of the  <dig> gene models annotated in the database required extensive changes, which were performed by visual inspection of dna sequencing traces, comparative amino acid sequence alignments and after cdna verification by rt-pcr. one additional gene model  contains  <dig> amino acids of globin-related sequence embedded in a large protein of  <dig> residues, annotated to be a calpain-like protease. we do not include this aberrant structure in the present analysis of bona fide globins.

due to the still highly fragmented nature of the branchiostoma genome draft, the picture of genomic organization of globin genes is currently incomplete. only eight out of  <dig> gene copies co-localize to the same scaffold, with four globins being located on genomic scaffold  <dig> . here, bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig> are situated in head-to-tail orientation only  <dig>  kb apart from each other, and their amino acid similarity  may suggest their origin by a relatively recent gene duplication. the distance between bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig> is  <dig> kb, between bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig> even more than  <dig> mbp, showing that amphioxus globin genes are widely disseminated instead of featuring the vertebrate-typical dense clustering. genes bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig> reside in head-to-head orientation separated by  <dig> kbp on scaffold  <dig> of the genome draft. this annotation is inconsistent with data of the trace archive, showing a head-to-tail orientation indicated by paired-end read information. bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig> reside on scaffold  <dig> at a distance of  <dig> mbp. all other seven globin genes are located on individual genomic scaffolds .

protein sequence comparisons and allelic differences
the lengths of the deduced branchiostoma globin sequences  range from  <dig> amino acids , which is consistent with the average length of the globin fold of 140- <dig> amino acids, to  <dig> residues . such elongations, observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> amphioxus globins, result from n-and c-terminal extensions of the globin fold. the functional relevance of these extensions, previously reported e.g. for vertebrate cygb  <cit>  and nematode globins  <cit> , is unclear. however, computer predictions using the psort ii program  <cit>  indicate that none of the amphioxus globins appears to contain a leader signal peptide, and all variants are predicted to be located in the cytoplasm. notably, eight branchiostoma globins , five of which are phylogenetically related to vertebrate gbx , possess a predicted n-myristoylation site. this may suggest an at least transient interaction with the cell membrane, thereby precluding an oxygen-supply function of these globins.

the comparison of the conceptionally translated amino acid sequences of b. floridae globins with human ngb, cygb and mb shows the conservation of the typical functional residues of globins  <cit>  in most of the amphioxus proteins, such as the distal histidine , the proximal histidine  and the phenylalanine at cd <dig> . while the proximal histidine, which coordinates the heme iron atom, is conserved in all  <dig> putative globins, the distal histidine is replaced by leucine in bflgb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the same replacement was previously reported in globins of glycera dibranchiata  <cit>  and in nematodes  <cit> . it creates an unusually hydrophobic ligand-binding site and may reduce affinity for polar ligands like o <dig>  <cit> . the same branchiostoma globin variants also show a change at amino acid position cd <dig> from phenylalanine to tryptophan, and bflgb <dig> displays an exchange of this residue by a tyrosine. position cd <dig>  is even more conserved during globin evolution than the distal histidine. in human hb, substitutions of cd <dig>  to non-aromatic amino acids usually lead to unstable globins and oxygenation problems  <cit> . the functional consequences of the more conservative cd <dig> changes in amphioxus variants, however, are unclear.

pair-wise comparisons of the branchiostoma globins display a substantial degree of divergence between the fifteen proteins. the most distant variants display a sequence identity of only 12%  and a similarity of 31% . as such, they are as distinct as vertebrate mb and cygb, which have separated before radiation of gnathostomes  <cit> . the most similar amphioxus paralogs  have 60% sequence identity and 83% similarity .

possibly due to a large effective population size, b. floridae is highly heterozygous, and the genome sequencing of one specimen has revealed two haplotypes for two-thirds of the approximately  <dig>  protein-coding loci  <cit> . we have identified allelic copies for  <dig> of the  <dig> globin variants . amino acid similarities/identities between alleles are high, ranging from 97/95% to 100%. taking into account these interallelic comparisons, the overall conservation of the globins on the protein level and the expression evidence on the rna level , we propose that most, if not all  <dig> globin gene variants in amphioxus can be considered active genes and at least  <dig> genes may encode functional globin proteins.

evidence for globin gene expression
est data provide evidence of transcription only for five branchiostoma globin genes . represented by  <dig> est entries, bflgb <dig> may be the most strongly expressed globin in whole adult animals. based on the est data and in silico-predictions, the coding regions of the fifteen genes were amplified by rt-pcr and completed by 5' and 3' race. amplicons were cloned and sequenced for verification . together, these data demonstrate transcriptional expression of all branchiostoma globin genes. of special interest is the assignment of est entry au <dig>  representing bflgb <dig>  to notochord tissue, as this facilitates further studies of the amphioxus globin components, which possibly serve to supply o <dig> to sustain the contractile function of notochord cells  <cit> . bflgb <dig>  however, has a predicted molecular mass of  <dig> kda and thus may not represent the major  <dig> kda notochord globin fraction, as isolated biochemically by bishop et al.  <cit> . several other globin variants  have predicted molecular masses between  <dig> and  <dig> kda.

identification of putative branchiostoma orthologs to vertebrate globins
the amino acid sequences of the  <dig> globin genes of branchiostoma were included in an alignment of selected vertebrate and invertebrate globins  <cit> . bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction revealed possible orthology relationships between amphioxus and vertebrate globins . most importantly, bflgb <dig> forms a common clade with vertebrate ngb. these two globins show 27%/49% identity/similarity. corroborating evidence for orthology was obtained by inspecting the organization at the genomic level. within vertebrates, the gene region containing ngb is strongly conserved in gene order and arrangement  <cit> . the human ngb gene resides on chromosome hsa14q <dig>  between the genes for protein-o-mannosyltransferase  <dig>  and transmembrane protein 63c   <cit> . while a tmem63c ortholog was not detectable on genomic scaffold  <dig> containing bflgb <dig>  the amphioxus orthologs of pomt <dig> and glutathione transferase zeta  <dig> , located on the distal, telomeric side of the human ngb gene, reside in close proximity to the bflgb <dig> gene . these findings are in agreement with putnam et al.  <cit> , who reported extensive micro-syntenic conservation of gene arrangement between amphioxus and humans on the whole-genome level. together with the phylogeny, the data are convincing evidence that we have identified an ortholog of vertebrate ngb in a basal chordate.

phylogenetical interpretation of the tree reconstruction  further suggests that the monophyletic clade comprising bflgb <dig>  bflgb <dig>  bflgb <dig>  bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig> contains the putative orthologs of vertebrate gbx, a distant relative of the ngb lineage, which is found only in fish and frogs, but not in birds and mammals  <cit> . this corroborates the scenario that gbx was already present in early chordates, but has been lost secondarily during tetrapod evolution. syntenic conservation of gbx flanking genes in xenopus tropicalis and tetraodon nigroviridis is restricted to three proximate genes encoding a pleckstrin domain containing protein , phospholipase and signal recognition particle srp <dig>  <cit> . notably the genome of b. floridae revealed the linkage of a plekhg gene to bflgb <dig>  substantiating the assumption of a possible gbx orthology .

another amphioxus globin clade comprising bflgb <dig>  bflgb <dig>  bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig> is paralogous to all other vertebrate globins . this clade also groups with the four monophyletic globin variants from the genome of the tunicate c. intestinalis  <cit> , which confirms our view that the c. intestinalis globins are not 1: <dig> orthologous to vertebrate globins.

a third monophyletic group of amphioxus globin variants, comprising bflgb <dig>  bflgb <dig>  bflgb <dig> and bflgb <dig>  joins the vertebrate mb-hb-cygb-gbe-gby lineage in the tree. it is noteworthy that this clade of amphioxus globins contains bflgb <dig>  which may be expressed in notochord tissue, possibly serving the mb-like role in o <dig> supply suggested by bishop et al.  <cit> . unfortunately, analysis of syntenic gene relationships of the mb, cygb and hb loci  <cit>  did not generate further positive evidence for 1: <dig> gene orthology between amphioxus and vertebrate globins, possibly due to the fragmentary nature of the draft genome assembly. the absence of clear cygb, mb, hb and gbe/y orthologues in branchiostoma may confirm that the gene duplications, which gave rise to these diverse vertebrate globin types, indeed happened after the split of cephalochordates and the vertebrate ancestor  <cit> . nevertheless, the phylogenetic predictions will facilitate guided functional comparisons of cephalochordate and vertebrate globins.

implications for the evolution of the ancestral vertebrate globin gene cluster
according to the current model of vertebrate globin evolution, the mammalian α-hbs constitute the ancestral vertebrate globin gene locus, while the β-cluster is the result of a transposition of globin genes into a region containing olfactory receptor  genes  <cit> . looking deeper into the evolutionary past, wetten et al.  <cit>  suggested a common origin of the vertebrate α-hb locus and two globin gene-containing regions in the c. intestinalis genome, as evidenced by the syntenic relationships of three globin-flanking genes. however, these genes do not show linkage to globins in the amphioxus genome. wetten et al.  <cit>  therefore proposed that they were secondarily linked to globin genes by a fusion of conserved genomic linkage groups   <cit>  to produce the ancestor of the vertebrate α-hb locus before the divergence of urochordates and vertebrates. our own analyses of gene synteny, however, do not provide support for this model, since we could not detect any of the b. floridae globin genes within the respective clgs. instead, we find that branchiostoma globins bflgb <dig> and  <dig> reside on the same genomic scaffold as the amphioxus orthologue of integrin-linked kinase , a conserved flanking gene of the β-hb cluster in men, chicken and marsupials  <cit> .

additionally, a detailed inspection of the clg's architecture  <cit>  reveals that the amphioxus genomic scaffold including bflgb <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> corresponds to human chromosomal region 11p <dig> - <dig> , the location of the β-hb cluster in man. of course, this hypothetical ancient orthology is at odds with the transpositional model for a more recent origin of the β-hb locus during vertebrate evolution . clearly, a reliable reconstruction of the pre-vertebrate globin loci will require the analysis of additional deuterostome genomes.

kinetics of ligand binding of the putative ngb ortholog, bflgb4
the ligand binding kinetics of recombinantly expressed bflgb <dig> after co photodissociation is biphasic , as previously observed for ngb and cygb  <cit> . the rapid phase is the competitive binding of co and the internal ligand , and can be simulated by a bimolecular reaction with co and a fixed rate of 4000/s for the protein ligand. from the slow phase, a rate for histidine dissociation of 2/s was extracted. this indicates that bflgb <dig> globin, like its vertebrate ortholog ngb  <cit> , is a hexacoordinated globin, which adopts a his-fe-his coordination in the absence of external ligands. the hexacoordination of the heme fe atom in bflgb <dig> underlines the view that this binding scheme represents an ancestral feature of animal and plant globins, from which penta-coordinated globins like hb and mb evolved  <cit> . the exact adaptive value of hexacoordination is still unclear. however, it may confer some unusual thermal and acidosis stability to the globin fold  <cit> , which could be relevant under environmental or cellular stress.

the co and o <dig> ligand association rates of bflgb <dig> are quite high , which places the amphioxus globin with ngb in terms of ligand binding kinetics. the overall oxygen affinity of bflgb <dig>  is about twice that for human ngb , due to a higher intrinsic o <dig> affinity. however, values are close enough to suggest similar functional roles of the orthologous proteins. in contrast to human ngb, bflgb <dig> apparently lacks internal cysteine residues, which have been hypothesized to modulate oxygen affinity depending on the cellular redox state  <cit> . note that the oxygen affinity for bflgb <dig> is intermediate to the two allosteric states of human ngb, and there is preliminary evidence in the kinetics of bflgb <dig> of an additional conformational state. clearly, further detailed comparisons are needed to extract conserved and taxon-specific features of these globins.

globin intron evolution and the presence of minisatellites in amphioxus globin genes
the ancestry and conservation of globins has stimulated studies to trace the evolutionary behavior of introns in these genes, aiming at contributing to the long-standing introns-early versus introns-late debate  <cit> . two introns at positions b <dig>   and g <dig>  are conserved in all vertebrate globins, in many invertebrate and even plant globin genes. they are therefore thought to have already existed in the globin gene ancestor  <cit> . both these intron positions can also be found conserved in all  <dig> amphioxus globin genes . in addition to the strictly conserved b <dig>  and g <dig>  introns, there are introns at slightly differing positions of the globin e-helix  present in globin genes of diverse taxa , which raised speculations on the presence of such a central intron already in the globin ancestor  <cit> . subsequent findings of different e-helix introns in globin genes of closely related insect species casted doubt on this view and argued for an intron gain scenario  <cit> . interestingly, the amphioxus globin genes reveal four different intron positions within the e-helix , of which only positions e <dig>   and e <dig>   have been reported before. this situation can in principle be explained by a positional shift of ancestral introns , intron loss or insertional intron gain. intron sliding, however, is thought to explain only very small intron shifts  <cit> . an intron loss scenario would require many such independent events on several branches of the phylogenetic tree . therefore, the most parsimonious explanation is that the divergent central intron positions in globin genes in amphioxus and other taxa are due to convergent intron gain. this is corroborated by the lack of a central intron in bflgb <dig>  the amphioxus ortholog of vertebrate ngb. intron gain may also be responsible for the presence of introns at the unprecedented positions hc <dig>   in amphioxus globin gene variants bflgb <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and intron position na <dig>   in gene bflgb <dig> .

detailed annotation of the genomic organization of amphioxus globin genes revealed conspicuous structures, which are interesting with respect to intron evolution. in gene bflgb <dig> we observed minisatellite-like tandem duplications, comprising the 3' end of the b <dig>  intron and the 5' part of exon  <dig>  while bflgb <dig> contains a duplicate of the 3' boundary of exon  <dig> . such tandem repeats spanning an exon-intron boundary have previously been reported in the alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  gene of b. floridae and b. lanceolatum and have been termed "mirages"  <cit> . other gene loci with similar structures have been reported in amphioxus  <cit> , possibly making this a more general phenomenon in cephalochordates. the genomic mechanism of generation of these minisatellites is unclear, and repeat units vary in length . the adh <dig> data as well as our globin rt-pcr results suggest that mirage structures do not interfere with regular splicing of the mrna, although many, but not all of the tandem repeats contain ag/gt splice signals  which could be used as cryptic splice sites producing alternative  transcripts. like other minisatellites, mirage clusters display length instability, possibly due to unequal or intra-strand crossing-overs, and even somatic instability has been detected at the adh <dig> locus  <cit> . for haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> of bflgb <dig>  we have observed  <dig> and  <dig> repeat units, respectively . the repeat units of bflgb <dig> display between  <dig> and 100% nucleotide sequence identity . reconstruction of cluster evolution by phylogenetic trees  reveals typical features of tandem repeat turnover  <cit> , namely concerted evolution within clusters  and exclusion of cluster boundaries  from such intra-allelic homogenization.

with respect to the evolution of introns, mirage repeats immediately offer a suggestive model to explain intron gain within the globin genes over evolutionary times . an exonic part of a repeat unit  may secondarily turn into a real exon, if its boundary cryptic splice signals are being used. if a suitably positioned splice acceptor site is already present or created by mutation within the original exon  <dig>  the mirage repeats in between will become intronic. in support of this model, we recognize degenerate tandem repeats within the hypothetically gained intron e <dig>  of bflgb <dig> . the general idea of intron gain by duplication events encompassing ag/gt proto-splice sites was originally introduced by rogers  <cit>  and has received renewed interest by studies of intron evolution in ray-finned fishes  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . recently, the systematic examination of six fully sequenced model organism genomes including humans, mouse and drosophila has emphasized the importance of internal gene duplications as a mechanism for intron generation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of putative orthologs of vertebrate globin variants ngb, gbx and the mb/cygb/hb lineage in the b. floridae genome emphasizes the particular value of cephalochordates as a reference taxon for vertebrate evolution. although the urochordate lineage may be overall more closely related to vertebrates, the tunicate  does not appear to harbour any 1: <dig> orthologs of vertebrate globin genes  <cit> . the present study facilitates detailed functional studies of the amphioxus globins in order to trace conserved properties and specific adaptations of respiratory proteins at the base of chordate evolution.
