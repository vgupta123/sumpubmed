BACKGROUND
several studies have now connected members of the mismatch repair pathway with the binding and metabolism of non b-form dna, but in a way that is different than simple heteroduplex repair. classically defined as a post-replication repair pathway, mismatch repair is initiated through lesion recognition by the muts homologs. this is accompanied by an adp-atp nucleotide exchange that modulates muts to signal downstream repair . both e. coli muts and the eukaryotic muts homologs, msh2/msh <dig> , have the extraordinary capacity to recognize and initiate repair of unrelated types of dna damage, such as uv photoproducts  <cit> , 8-oxoguanine pairings  <cit> , methylated or platinated dna  <cit> , and deoxyuracil  <cit> . in addition to base modifications, dna structural alterations are recognized. human msh2/msh <dig>  binds disease-associated hairpins folded from cag repeats  <cit> , mutsα and msh4/msh <dig> recognize four-stranded holliday junctions  <cit> , and human mutsα binds specifically to g quadruplexes  found in the immunoglobulin switch regions  <cit> . this incredibly broad substrate range for the muts homologs suggests that non-b form dna structures may be conserved substrates for the complex across species.

repetitive dna sequences promote secondary structure formation, and this is affiliated with site-specific gene rearrangements and genome instability . g quadruplex  is a four-stranded structure that folds from guanine-rich repetitive dna and can adopt multiple potential conformations . tandemly repetitive guanines support g <dig> formation under physiological ionic and ph conditions with four hydrogen bonded guanines forming individual tetrads which are stacked on top of one another to form g <dig> structures  <cit>  . at a minimum, sequences able to sustain g <dig> structure formation must contain a motif of at least three guanines repeated four times or more with up to a few non-guanine nucleotides separating the motifs  <cit> . exceeding this minimal standard are repetitive non-coding sequences found throughout the human genome which show extensive g <dig> folding potential  <cit> . genome analyses reveal that g <dig> dna structures are abundant genome residents and have likely been retained over evolutionary time to facilitate various molecular activities. for instance, pillin gene rearrangement in neisseria depends on upstream g <dig> structure formation, and sequence disruption or chemical stabilization of g4-folding capacity at these sites interferes with break formation and recombination  <cit> . in mammals, immunoglobulin gene class switch recombination requires the transcription of intronic switch regions and this results in the formation of co-transcriptional g <dig> dnas . roles for g <dig> dna in gene regulation are supported by informatic analyses identifying g <dig> capable sequences at upstream gene regulatory regions in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  <cit> , human  <cit> , and prokaryotic  <cit>  genomes. it has been suggested that structure formation in these regions influences gene expression rates because 5’ transcriptional pausing correlates with g <dig> folding potential  <cit> .

while retention of g <dig> dna sequences in diverse genomes suggests genetic roles, structure formation appears to come at a cost to genome stability. in a few examples, minisatellites in mice and humans with high g <dig> potential are hypervariable , dna breakpoints in cancer genomes associated with somatic copy number variations regularly map to g <dig> sequences , and reciprocal translocations of the c-myc gene and the immunoglobulin switch regions occur at g <dig> sequences .

evidence has emerged that connects the highly conserved mismatch repair proteins with cellular responses to g <dig> dna. human msh2/msh <dig>  has been directly visualized by electron microscopy bound to the g-rich and g <dig> capable strand of expressed immunoglobulin switch regions, enriched in chromatin ips of the transcriptionally activated switch regions, and shown to specifically recognize g <dig> oligonucleotide dna via mobility shift assays  <cit> . also in humans, demonstration that fancj helicase specifically unwinds g <dig> dna  <cit> , coupled with co-immunoprecipitations finding muts and mutl homologs associated with members of the fanconi anemia pathway  <cit> , suggests similar roles with regard to g <dig> metabolism. while precise functions in structure-associated genome instability are not clear, it does appear likely that non-b form binding is a shared property of the muts proteins based on the broad substrate range and apparent recognition of g <dig> dna binding by the human homologs. here, we test the model that e. coli muts recognizes g <dig> dna structures. further, we ask if such binding is affiliated with canonical mismatch repair. with mobility shift assays, we identify g <dig> dna as a high-affinity substrate for e. coli muts. interestingly, we also find that g <dig> dna and heteroduplex binding constitute separable muts functions. our results argue that the genome instability and recombination associated with g <dig> dna may involve repair-independent functions of highly conserved mismatch repair proteins.

RESULTS
e. coli muts specifically recognizes g <dig> dna
the observations that human muts homologs specifically recognize four-stranded holliday junctions  <cit>  and g <dig> dna  <cit>  prompted us to ask if alternative dna structure binding is a property of prokaryotic muts proteins and the mismatch repair pathway. sequence motifs characteristic of g <dig> formation have been documented in various prokaryotes, including e. coli <cit> , but highly repetitive g-rich sequences are rare when compared to the more complex genomic structure characteristic of many multicellular eukaryotes. therefore, we used two model sequences known for strong g <dig> folding ability and for utility in g <dig> molecular assays. these sequences are derived from a recombination hot-spot, the g-rich mammalian switch regions, and have utility in binding assays because they readily adopt well-documented g <dig> dna structures  <cit> . we folded a four-stranded g <dig> structure from the tp oligonucleotide   <cit> , and a second longer sequence  that supports more complex fold-back g <dig> structures. tp-g <dig> dna was folded using published conditions  <cit> , and structure formation measured by circular dichroism . as expected, cd spectra analysis combined with salt-dependent denaturation profile confirmed the formation of g4-dna by agreeing with anticipated g <dig> spectra, showing a peak at ~260 nm and a ~240 nm minima  <cit>  with peaks being thermally stable in the presence of k+ ion but not li+ ion . having confirmed that our oligonucleotide-based structure forms g <dig> by mobility shift  and cd spectrometry, we used this tp-g <dig> dna to assay muts structure-binding properties in vitro.

in the cell, g <dig> dna is expected to be unimolecular, a fold-back structure occurring within genomic dna that has been transiently freed from complement during transcription or replication . therefore in order to further examine mismatch repair responses to dna with potential to adopt non-b form structures, we also examined a longer molecule previously demonstrated to adopt co-transcriptional g <dig>  <cit> , a fragment of the human sγ <dig> switch region. we cloned a 564 bp g-rich region of sγ <dig> into m <dig> and into pcr <dig>  phagmids for g <dig> detection assays . in these phage, when single-stranded dna is replicated for packaging and export, one strand is liberated from perfect complement and thus permitted to adopt alternative dna structures. template g <dig> dna structures present physical blockades to advancing dna synthesis, which marks structure formation sites  <cit> . therefore, we used klenow extension reactions to detect structure formation by priming the two single-stranded templates with a 32p end-labeled oligonucleotide  just upstream of the sγ <dig> sequence. when the extension reactions were resolved by denaturing page, sites of stalled synthesis were evident for the single-stranded g-rich template but not the c-rich complement . this stalling is very likely to be due to g <dig> structure formation because polymerase pause sites mapped to guanine repeats, determined by comparison to di-deoxy sequencing of the g-rich template. furthermore, we always observed products of complete extension when the c-rich complement was used at a template . this g-rich sγ <dig> fragment was therefore used in this study to assay muts-dependent responses to structure-capable dna in two strains of e. coli.

mobility shift assays identify g <dig> dna as a substrate for the muts homologs
we first asked if purified e. coli muts was able to recognize g4-containing oligonucleotides and if binding was comparable heteroduplex recognition. using a mobility shift assay, we observed that muts specifically recognized an oligonucleotide carrying a single g-t mismatch, a well-known high-affinity substrate for muts  <cit>  . identical mobility shift assays containing end-labeled g <dig> dna in place of labeled g-t heteroduplex clearly showed a muts dose-dependent reduction in g <dig> mobility on native page . this g <dig> binding cannot be attributed to non-specific interactions by muts because all assays contained a 10-fold molar excess of non-specific competitor, an unlabeled homoduplex oligonucleotide . muts bound g <dig> in the low nm range, showing an apparent kd of  <dig>  nm, a dissociation constant more than 2-fold lower than what was observed with heteroduplex oligonucleotides under identical assay conditions . strikingly, progressively slower migrating bands are observed with increasing muts concentrations for the g <dig> but not g-t oligonucleotides . multiple muts dimers may associate with g <dig> dna as protein concentration increases, a binding state that is clearly distinct from simple heteroduplex recognition and a binding pattern similarly observed for other g <dig> binding proteins, such as the recq homologs  <cit> . regardless, the relative affinity and binding characteristics are remarkably close to human mutsα, which showed in the same assay up to a  <dig> fold higher affinity for g <dig> folded oligonucleotide compared to g-t heteroduplex  <cit> . we conclude from these assays that g <dig> dna is a conserved and specific substrate for the muts homologs, from e. coli to humans.

mismatch discrimination is not required for g <dig> recognition
muts recognition of heteroduplex dna in vitro and activation of the mismatch repair pathway depends on the highly conserved phenylalanine at position  <dig>  studies in which this phe is replaced with ala  established this highly conserved residue as critical for heteroduplex recognition and mismatch correction  <cit> . we therefore reasoned that if g <dig> structure recognition followed canonical heteroduplex binding activities and repair, muts binding to g <dig> dna should require phe <dig>  we replaced the phenylalanine at position  <dig> of e. coli muts in the ptx <dig> plasmid  with alanine  using site-directed mutagenesis. his-tagged muts was over-expressed, and the gene product purified to homogeneity . nickel-affinity purified muts f36a failed to recognize mismatched dna in mobility shift assays at all protein concentrations tested , as expected and consistent with the previous study  <cit> . in contrast, muts f36a decreased the mobility of g4-containing oligonucleotides in a dose-dependent manner , demonstrating that the phe <dig> residue is not required for g <dig> dna recognition. notably, muts f36a does not bind g <dig> dna as effectively as wild-type muts. at a concentration of  <dig> nm, 90% of the labeled g <dig> is bound by muts whereas only 63% of the g <dig> is bound at the same concentration of muts f36a . this attenuated binding may indicate that substitution of phe <dig> influences the muts structure in a way that changes g <dig> affinity. nevertheless, it appears likely that phe <dig> itself is not critical to the discrimination of g <dig> dna structures from properly paired duplex dna, in sharp contrast to muts heteroduplex recognition activity.

muts remains bound to g <dig> dna in the presence of atpγs
during mismatch repair, the muts homologs must release from heteroduplex to activate dna excision and resynthesis . addition of either atp or slowly hydrolyzing analogs to binding assays interferes with specific complex formation between muts and heteroduplexes  <cit>  reflecting muts movement away from the lesion to signal downstream repair. if g <dig> dna binding by muts is accompanied by mismatch repair, addition of atp to the binding reaction is expected to interfere with g4-muts complex formation. using mobility shift assay and sub-physiological concentrations of atpγs, muts was not able to shift g-t oligonucleotides, as expected . atpγs concentrations above 250 μm resulted in appearance of completely free heteroduplex, and muts mismatch complex was unstable even at 60 μm atpγs . this was not the case for mobility shift assays using g <dig> oligonucleotide as the substrate. under identical assay conditions, muts and muts f36a binding to g <dig> dna was largely unaffected by atpγs  and kd values for g <dig> binding were essentially unchanged in the presence and absence of up to 1 mm atpγs . while the apparent kd is similar, muts f36a-g <dig> binding in the presence or absence of atpγs does show an altered binding pattern compared to muts mobility shift of g <dig>  which may indicate that the f36a substitution influences the interaction with g <dig> dna. consistent with mobility shift assays in the absence of atpγs, progressively slower migrating bands are observed with increasing muts protein  indicating that muts is unresponsive to atpγs when bound to g <dig> dna. based on a requirement for muts nucleotide binding status to modulate heteroduplex binding and subsequent repair activities in the mismatch repair pathway, our results support a model whereby muts is not able to activate atp-dependent canonical mismatch repair in response to g <dig> dna structures.

muts f36a facilitates efficient infection by g-rich m <dig> phage
mobility shift assays with purified protein and model g <dig> oligonucleotides in vitro imply that e. coli muts will respond to non-b form dna structures, independent of repair activation, in vivo. while the genome of e. coli is mostly coding and generally non-repetitive compared to higher eukaryotes, the genomes of bacteriophage are characteristically non-b form. in particular, filamentous phages, such as m <dig>  infect e. coli and replicate by rolling-circle replication using a circular duplex intermediate. by nature of a single-stranded circular genome, these viruses present a dna molecule that is already non-b form, although we have increased the structure forming potential of m <dig> even further by introducing the g-rich sγ <dig> fragment . we use this m <dig> variant  and the parent molecule  to ask if the presence of muts or mismatch repair activities influences phage infection success.

to ask if there are repair-independent and structure-associated roles for muts in the cell, we infected several e. coli strains with m <dig> phage containing the g <dig> capable sequence shown in figure 1h. importantly, the g-rich strand from the sγ <dig> fragment forms robust structures that stall dna synthesis , most likely attributed to g <dig> formation when the molecules are single-stranded circles free from prefect complement. we placed this sequence within m <dig>  such that rolling circle replication will liberate the cloned g <dig> capable  single-strand. we then infected muts proficient , deficient nm <dig> muts::tn <dig> , or jw <dig> expressing muts f36a  to ask if muts and mismatch repair are needed for infection efficiency when m <dig> harbors this additional non-viral dna sequence. phage infection success for muts defective strain was measured by counting plaques normalizing to an isogenic muts proficient strain.

successful m <dig> phage infection of bacteria results in the formation of a plaque on lb agar plates. we first titered phage stocks of m13-g and m13mp <dig> using nm <dig> and defined the volume required to generate ~ <dig> plaques/plate for each stock. using identical volumes and conditions, m13mp <dig> infection showed nearly equal plaques/plate for both nm <dig> and jw <dig>  indicating that the muts protein is not required for efficient infection by m13mp <dig> phage. in contrast, infection with m13-g resulted in ~50% fewer plaques relative to nm <dig> infection suggesting that disruption of muts interferes with phage infection when their genomes harbor exogenous sequences. this is most likely not associated with mismatch repair because expression of muts f36a in jw <dig>  a mutant defective in mismatch binding and repair but functional for g <dig> binding ability , resulted in near complete restoration of m13-g phage infection to that of nm <dig>  although this experiment does not define g <dig> dna structures or a g4-specific pathway as the target for muts in the cell, it does support physiological roles for the muts complex that are outside of heteroduplex recognition. however, it seems likely that muts does physically interact with sγ <dig> g <dig> dna in the cell because immunoprecipitations using muts antibody weakly enriched for endogenously expressed muts physically bound to the g-rich sγ <dig> expressed in the g4-capable conformation, but not when this sequence placed in the reverse and g <dig> incapable orientation . further, previous em experiments visualized g <dig> structure formation of intracellularly expressed murine sγ <dig> dna  <cit> . considering that filamentous single-stranded phage dna is already non-b form, a condition that is enhanced in m13-g due to the additional sγ <dig> sequence , we conclude that muts has functional roles in the cell associated with dna structure formation, activities that cannot be easily attributed to mismatch binding or to the canonical mismatch repair pathway.

discussion
our experiments tested the hypothesis that muts homologs are capable of recognizing non-b form dna structures, and that such binding is independent of the classically defined mismatch repair pathway. we show here that e. coli muts specifically recognizes g <dig> dna with apparent affinity higher to that of g-t mismatched binding. structural analysis and binding studies of the muts homodimer previously demonstrated that recognition of mismatched bases is facilitated by one highly conserved phe at position  <dig> which facilitates mismatch recognition by stacking with one of the mispaired bases  <cit> . the utility of such a mechanism is a capacity to recognize multiple types of different base mismatches  <cit> . substitution of this residue completely blocks mismatch recognition and repair  <cit> . nevertheless, muts f36a retains moderate affinity for g <dig> structuresas measured by mobility shift assay . further, expression of a muts f36a transgene rescued the ability of g4-capable phage to efficiently infect muts deficient cells . our findings indicate that the phe at position  <dig>  required for recognition of heteroduplexes, is not required for structure recognition. this strongly points toward a distinct mechanism for structure recognition by muts. even so, it seems most likely that the g <dig> dna binding domain of muts overlaps with that of the heteroduplex domain because g <dig> binding was reduced by ~20%  for purified muts f36a compared to wild type protein. we cannot, however, exclude the possibility that an alternate binding domain is collaterally perturbed by substitution of phe <dig> in a way that influences structure binding affinity, or that the muts f36a protein has lower activity overall.

the licensing of mismatch repair activities by muts depends upon conformational changes and communication between two distant muts domains, one for dna recognition and the other for atp binding and hydrolysis. in binding experiments nucleotide status modulates muts complex formation with heteroduplex dna, and the addition of atp results in movement of muts away from the mismatch  <cit> . consistent with that activity, we did not observe stable muts-bound g-t mismatched oligonucleotides at atpγs concentrations tested in mobility shift assays . in contrast, and under identical reaction conditions, both muts and muts f36a remained associated with g <dig> dna in the presence of atpγs , although the binding pattern appears different for muts f36a compared to wild-type muts . therefore it appears that atp-induced muts conformational changes that promote heteroduplex release are inadequate to dissociate muts from g <dig> dna. this is a deviation from well-defined binding properties of the muts homologs, and supports the notion that g <dig> recognition is not affiliated with mismatch repair as currently defined. indeed, atpγs-independent binding to g <dig> dna is not confined to e. coli muts as this binding mode is shared with the human muts homologs. both holliday junctions and g <dig> dna are bound with high affinity by human mutsα in the presence of atp  <cit> . in contrast with e. coli muts, the human complex may have additional responses to dna structures because synthetic four-way junctions do not appear to be specific binding substrates . regardless, it seems likely that the muts homologs have at least two binding activities; one is affiliated with heteroduplex recognition and atp-induced mismatch repair, and the other responsive to g <dig> dna and independent of methyl-directed mismatch repair.

genomic regions rich in repetitive guanine are common in higher eukaryotes, but rarer in prokaryotes. g-rich introns located at the 5’ end of expressed loci have been correlated with transcriptional pausing, providing a gene regulation rational for why genetically unstable g-rich dna may be retained in mammals  <cit> . however, and relevant to recombination, many hot-spots for genetic rearrangement in mammals contain guanine repeats, such as the immunoglobulin switch region, telomeres, and the rdna . this is in striking contrast to prokaryote genomes because, with the exception of the pillin genes in neisseria recombination  <cit> , few recombination-associated sites with strong g4-forming potential have been described. generally, the prokaryotic loci with g <dig> potential are short in sequence and located within promoter regions  <cit> . in other words, g4-capable sequences found within extensive non-coding repetitive elements are rare in prokaryotes, and this is consistent with the more minimalist genomes of single-celled organisms. it is possible that the genetic instability inherent to large sequences with g <dig> potential is not well tolerated in prokaryotes, and any gene regulatory benefits attributed to g <dig> structure formation are not sufficient to outweigh the negative consequences associated with the higher potential for genome instability.

considering the paucity of extensive g <dig> dna in prokaryotes, our findings raise an interesting question regarding the reason e. coli muts has such a robust g <dig> binding ability. we consider it unlikely that the high affinity g4-binding activity of e. coli muts , or even that the mammalian homologs  <cit> , has been evolutionarily retained for gene regulation activities through binding promoter-proximal g <dig> structures. this notion is based exclusively on well-established roles for the complex in repair and recombination. instead, we find it more plausible that the muts homologs play yet to be defined roles in alternative dna structure resolution or site-specific recombination. in humans, mutsα directly interacts with the blm helicase  <cit> , and blm has a g <dig> dna unwinding activity  <cit> . further, human mutsα was shown to inhibit fancj unwinding of g <dig> dna structures  <cit>  suggesting muts homologs may play a role in pathway selection for g <dig> resolution. however, additional studies will be required to determine g4-specific functions in the cell. nevertheless, the g <dig> binding we observe with e. coli muts may reflect a mechanism for discouraging domestication of repetitive dna elements.

the specific pathways remain to be identified, but it is feasible that muts helps facilitate replication when structures are present or allows unstable dna elements to be removed by recombination. either way, it is clear that the function of muts in g <dig> dna metabolism is not associated with the methyl-directed mismatch repair as currently defined. mismatch repair factors in e. coli mediated instability at non-b form structure sites within a plasmid-encoded intron from the pkd <dig> gene  <cit> . this possibly reflects structure-dependent responses. such activities may explain the reduced plaques upon m13-g infection of jw <dig>  however, such functions cannot be attributed to mismatch recognition because return of muts f36a to jw <dig> recovered m13-g infection success to m13mp <dig> levels . muts homologs may contribute to genomic stability at non-b form dna by rearrangement at dna structures or another pathway that permits replication through difficult templates. these pathways are not defined for g <dig> dna, and further experimentation will be required to determine how muts proteins participate in cellular responses to non-b form dna.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have found that e. coli muts has a specific g <dig> structure binding activity. based on the inability of muts or mutsα to release from g <dig> in the presence of atp, it is likely that non-b form structure recognition follows a pathway distinct from heteroduplex repair. it is interesting to speculate that part of the genome instability associated with g <dig> dna may be associated with blockage of canonical repair processes attempting to operate in the vicinity of g <dig> structures. additional experiments are required to determine the relationship between conserved g <dig> binding capacity and mismatch repair activities and the functional consequences to genome stability.
