BACKGROUND
anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan-3-ols belong to the group of the ubiquitous secondary metabolites known as flavonoids. they represent the main classes of phenolic compounds in fruit  <cit>  and play a central role as determinants of fruit quality. the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments in fruit provides essential cultivar differentiation for consumers and represents an important factor for marketability, while the flavan-3-ols  can be a major influence on fruit flavour. proanthocyanidins impart astringency to fresh fruits, fruit juices and wine, oxidise to form brown pigments in seeds and other tissues and may act as feeding deterrents in reproductive tissues and developing fruits  <cit> . anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan-3-ols influence the health attributes of our fruit thanks to their natural antioxidant capacity  <cit> . several studies correlated the intake of these compounds with the lower incidences of certain chronic diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disease  <cit> .

peach is an important global rosaceous fruit with world production of over  <dig> million tonnes in  <dig>  concentrated in centres such as china, italy, spain and usa . peach and nectarine  are characterized by a wide range of different cultivars, with their health attributes and colour of both skin and flesh being important factors for consumer choice. red colour in peach fruit has been the object of most breeding programs. in particular, high levels of red colouration have been sought in cultivars for the fresh market. in contrast, reduced pigment content in any part of the fruit has been the aim of most breeding programs for the canning industry because of the possibility of staining in the processed product. the primary pigment responsible for red colouration in peaches and nectarines is cyanidin and, in particular, cyanidin 3-glucoside, one of the most common anthocyanin pigments in fruit  <cit> . the main flavan-3-ol identified in peach is catechin, while the flavonols are dominated by three glycosylated quercetins   <cit> .

anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan-3-ols are synthesized via the flavonoid pathway, whose genetics and biochemistry have been well characterized in several plant species  <cit> . the pathway consists of several steps, which are common to the synthesis of different flavonoids, and branch steps, which are more specific for each type of flavonoid . the flavonoid pathway appears to be mainly regulated at the level of transcription of genes encoding the enzymes of the pathway  <cit> . several transcription factors  have been isolated in a diverse group of plants  <cit>  which control this transcription. in particular, interacting r2r3-myb and bhlh type tfs, form a complex with wd <dig> proteins , to activate the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthetic genes. the mbw complex usually regulates groups of flavonoid biosynthetic genes, which vary between species  <cit> . this regulation is via specific binding to motifs in the promoters of the pathway genes  <cit> .

several studies conducted on apple  confirmed that all the biosynthetic genes leading to the anthocyanin synthesis are co-ordinately regulated  <cit> . the r2r3-myb and bhlh tfs responsible for the anthocyanin accumulation have been isolated and characterized  <cit> . in contrast, the grape r2r3-myb tf vvmyba, which regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis, appears to activate only the udp-glucose:flavonoid-3-o-glycosyltranferase  gene. this plays a key role in colour development in grape skin, distinguishing white and red grapes  <cit> . a peach tf, ppmyb <dig>  has been shown to activate both the tobacco anthocyanin pathway, and the arabidopsis dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  promoter, when assayed transiently  <cit> .

flavonols are synthesized from the dihydroflavonols by flavonol synthase  enzymes . in peach the major flavonols are quercetin derivatives  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the regulation of flavonol biosynthesis has been investigated. three closely related mybs atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  regulate atfls <dig> and other steps  <cit> . in maize, the orthologue of fls is regulated by uv exposure via activation of maize’s myb/bhlh orthologous transcription factors  <cit> . in grape vvmybf <dig> regulates grape fls in a light dependent manner  <cit> .

the genes encoding enzymes specific for the proanthocyanidins  have been isolated from, amongst others, apple and grape  <cit> . takos et al.,   <cit>  showed that the proanthocyanidin biosynthetic genes in apple appear to be differentially regulated in comparison to other flavonoid biosynthetic genes. studies in grape report the characterization of at least four myb tfs  that regulate steps in the flavonoid pathway, which could affect the accumulation of the proanthocyanidins in leaves, flowers and early in berry development, before the véraison stage. these mybs induce the expression of both the proanthocyanidin branch genes and several of the general flavonoid pathway genes, but not ufgt <cit> .

adding to the complexity of the transcriptional control of flavonoid biosynthesis is a group of myb tfs which act as repressors of the pathway  <cit> . in particular, the regulatory activity of an r3-myb tf called atmybl <dig>  has been characterized in arabidopsis, where it plays a crucial role in the repression of anthocyanin biosynthesis. a model has been proposed whereby atmybl <dig> interferes with the activity of the mbw complex  <cit> . in apple  <cit>  and strawberry  <cit>  myb repressors have been examined and shown to increase with fruit maturity, even though anthocyanin levels are increasing, suggesting competition with myb activators.

most of the genes encoding enzymes leading to the anthocyanin synthesis in peach fruit have been studied  <cit> . crosses of red and non-red peaches suggest that a major gene controls peach colour  <cit> . however, there is no data about either the flavonol  or flavan-3-ol specific genes  or the regulation of the flavonoid metabolism in this plant. in this study we report the transcript levels of the main biosynthetic genes leading to the synthesis of anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavan-3-ols in ‘stark red gold’ nectarines during fruit growth, ripening, and environmental manipulation. we also identified key tfs, which appear to play a crucial role in the regulation of the flavonoid pathway in peach/nectarine acting to activate  or potentially repress . members of these transcriptional complexes activated the peach ufgt and lar <dig> promoters, and were responsive to both developmental and environmental stimuli.

RESULTS
anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol accumulation during fruit development and ripening
the development series of ‘stark red gold’ nectarine, and the anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol accumulation in fruit tissues, are shown in figure  <dig>  during fruit growth there were two peaks of anthocyanin accumulation in peel: one early in development  and the other at the end of fruit growth . very low concentrations of anthocyanin were observed for fruit in the middle stages of development. the anthocyanins detected were either cyanidin 3-glucoside or cyanidin 3-rutinoside as seen in previous studies  <cit> , with cyanidin 3-rutinoside present only at the beginning of fruit development  at low concentration. in contrast, the concentration of proanthocyanidins or flavan-3-ols, in both peel and flesh, was low at the beginning of fruit development , strongly increased at mid-development, and finally decreased again during ripening . flavonols  showed a similar pattern to anthocyanin, being skin located, but showed no increase at maturity .

no anthocyanin was detected by hplc analysis in the flesh at any developmental stage. however, a few red stripes were observed near the stone during the sampling of the ripe fruit . this suggests that this cultivar can accumulate anthocyanins in flesh, but in the sampled tissue concentrations were too low for detection by hplc analysis.

rna expression profile of the flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes in nectarine fruit
the sequences of nine putative flavonoid biosynthetic genes were identified in the publicly available peach nucleotide and est databases. for each biosynthetic gene, we selected the peach sequence expressed in fruit which showed the highest homology in blast searches to the malus × domestica corresponding protein. the levels of transcription of these nine selected flavonoid biosynthetic genes were determined, in both peel and flesh of ‘stark red gold’ nectarines, during fruit development and ripening using quantitative pcr .

the early biosynthetic genes common to both anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol biosynthesis within the phenylpropanoid pathway  and the late biosynthetic steps specific for proanthocyanidins and anthocyanin  showed contrasting patterns . the transcript levels of most of these genes were very low at the beginning of fruit development , strongly increased up to  <dig> dafb and then decreased again through to fruit maturation  in both peel and flesh. a slightly different expression profile was recorded for the ldox gene, which encodes the enzyme that is the last common step shared by anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol biosynthesis. its transcript level in both peel and flesh was low at the beginning of fruit development, increased from  <dig> dafb up to  <dig> dafb, and then remained high throughout fruit maturation .

in contrast, the expression profile of the ufgt gene was significantly different to all the other biosynthetic genes examined . its transcript in peel was most abundant at the beginning  and end  of fruit growth, remaining low throughout the middle of development . ufgt transcript was detected also in flesh, but only in the last ripe fruit time point . this pattern of expression correlated with the pattern of anthocyanin accumulation in fruit, but was not statistically significant .

transcript levels of fls were well correlated with the accumulation of flavonols . fls showed no flesh expression suggesting tight skin-specific regulation of the gene. lar and anr showed very similar patterns of expression to each other and were expressed in both skin and flesh. this followed the profile of proanthocyanidin levels  which is present in both skin and flesh.

quantitative pcr expression analysis of putative transcription factor genes in nectarine fruit
candidate genes encoding tfs involved in the regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis were selected within prunus sequences in the genome database for rosaceae  or by homology with malus × domestica and arabidopsis tfs. in particular, the sequences showing the highest homology to members of the anthocyanin regulating transcriptional complex  and polyphenolic-related mybs were selected for primer design. lead candidates for expression analysis were peach myb <dig> and bhlh <dig>  because of their high homology to the activators of anthocyanin synthesis in apple . a candidate gene showing high blast homology to the wd <dig> ttg <dig>  protein was found . r2r <dig> mybs with homology to vvmybf <dig>  vvmyb5a, atmyb <dig> , vvmybpa <dig> and vvmybpa <dig> were selected by best blast match. potential repressor mybs, peach myb <dig> and myb <dig> showed homology to apple repressors  <cit> . a phylogeny of full length predicted proteins was generated .

the expression profiles of candidate tf genes, myb <dig>  bhlh <dig> and wd <dig>  were investigated in both peel and flesh of ‘stark red gold’ nectarines at different developmental stages . transcript of myb <dig> was detectable only in fruit peel, where its level was highest from  <dig> to  <dig> dafb and lower at the beginning  and end of fruit growth . two notable features of the myb <dig> profile were the absence at all stages of any flesh myb <dig> transcript and the lower levels of transcript in mature skin at a stage when ufgt and anthocyanin accumulation is at its maximum. expression profiles of the bhlh <dig> and wd <dig> genes in both peel and flesh followed the pattern of most of the genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes, with a maximum at  <dig> dafb in fruit development. its transcript was also well expressed in ripe fruit , as was observed for the ldox and ufgt genes.

the potential proanthocyanidin regulating myb, mybpa <dig>  was expressed in both peel and flesh with transcript level correlating with the profiles of flavan-3-ols . in ripe fruit, where ldox and ufgt were most up-regulated and lar and anr down-regulated, the transcription of mybpa <dig> was barely detectable. the other potential regulator of proanthocyanidins, ppmybpa <dig>  showed no expression in fruit . myb <dig> and myb <dig>  both good candidates for flavonol regulation, show both skin-specificity and a decline at maturity. this correlates with the flavonol levels which are restricted to skin, early in development .

the potential repressor mybs, myb <dig> and myb <dig>  were expressed in both peel and flesh with transcript level correlating well with the profiles of most of the biosynthetic genes up to  <dig> dafb . however, in ripe fruit, where ldox and ufgt were most up-regulated, and anthocyanins are accumulated, the transcription of myb <dig> was barely detectable.

differential activation of nectarine biosynthetic gene promoters by myb <dig> and mybpa1
to test the role of myb <dig> and mybpa <dig> on the activation of nectarine/peach flavonoid synthesis, the promoters of peach ufgt, dfr and lar were isolated and cloned into the dual luciferase assay system  <cit> . n. benthamiana was transiently transformed by infiltration with an agrobacterium suspension containing a luciferase reporter construct with fragments of each promoter and a separate agrobacterium suspension containing 35s:ppmyb <dig>  35s:ppmybpa <dig> and 35s:ppbhlh <dig>  while the control infiltration  showed only minimal activity, co-infiltration of myb <dig> with 35s:ppbhlh <dig> showed a large rise in ufgt and dfr promoter activity with a ratio of luc to ren of  <dig>  or  <dig>  respectively . infiltration of the reporter with bhlh <dig> or myb <dig> alone resulted in low activation. in contrast, mybpa <dig> had little activity against the ufgt promoter, and good activity in promoting luc expression if driven by the dfr and lar promoters. this activation required bhlh <dig>  myb <dig> showed little ability to activate the lar promoter.

light-induced accumulation of anthocyanin in nectarine fruit correlates with the expression of the myb-bhlh tfs
mature fruit were harvested from shaded areas of the tree, which showed low levels of colour. these fruit were either given a light treatment  or covered for 72 hours. treatment with artificial light was able to strongly increase the red colouration of the peel , inducing the biosynthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins. the other polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonols and proanthocyanidins showed no significant increase with uv + white light . the influence of the light treatment on the levels of expression of dfr, ufgt, myb <dig>  ppbhlh <dig> and wd <dig> genes was investigated by qpcr analyses . the transcripts of all the assayed genes, except the wd <dig>  were elevated in the bright red peel of the fruit exposed to the light treatment, in comparison to low levels of transcript in the yellow peel of the fruit at harvest time and after 72 hours in the dark.

the transcript of the dfr and ufgt genes were respectively eightfold and fourfold more abundant in the light-exposed fruit than in those just harvested or kept in the dark, correlating well with the fruit peel colour. transcripts of myb <dig>  and bhlh <dig> genes were induced by the light treatment. in particular, the expression of the myb <dig> gene was the most strongly responsive to the light, showing a 30-fold elevation in the light-exposed fruit compared to the fruit at harvest time. transcript level of myb <dig> declined to not detectable levels in the fruit kept in the dark.

other flavonoid related genes were also analysed . only fls showed a slight stimulation by uv/light exposure, while the regulatory mybs mybpa <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> were also up-regulated by the treatment.

discussion
regulation of anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol biosynthesis in nectarine/peach
the regulation of anthocyanin and flavan-3-ol biosynthesis has been studied in a diverse range of crops such as apple  <cit> , grape  <cit> , strawberry  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and pepper  <cit> . this is due to their influence on fruit and vegetable colour, flavour and health attributes. however, there is apparently no data about the transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid metabolism in peach and nectarine .

our results showed that anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols have different patterns of accumulation in ‘stark red gold’ nectarines during development, as observed previously  <cit> . flavan-3-ols mainly accumulated at mid-season in both skin and flesh, whereas anthocyanin pigments were detected only in peel and showed peaks of biosynthesis at the beginning and end of fruit development .

a similar profile for the anthocyanin accumulation was observed in the peel of ‘flavortop’ nectarines by tsuda et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . in this cultivar anthocyanin accumulation correlated with the transcript levels of four anthocyanin biosynthetic genes , assayed by rna gel-blot analysis. our qpcr results showed that only the transcript level of the ppufgt gene showed weak correlation with the accumulation of anthocyanin in fruit peel, whereas all the other flavonoid biosynthetic genes correlated with the concentration of the flavan-3-ols . fls expression was correlated well with flavonol profile. these findings suggest that ufgt and fls in peach fruit might be regulated more specifically than the other flavonoid genes, as observed in grape  <cit> .

transcription factors controlling flavonoid biosynthesis
several studies have shown that the expression of the ufgt gene in grape is regulated by the r2r3-myb tf vvmyba <dig>  which closely correlates with anthocyanin accumulation in grape skin  <cit> . other biosynthetic genes of the grape flavonoid pathway appear to be regulated by other r2r3-myb tfs  which were recently isolated and characterized in grape  <cit> . the pattern of expression of the candidate tf genes assayed in developing ‘stark red gold’ nectarines suggests a tight regulation of ufgt expression, which controls accumulation of anthocyanin in the peel. lar and anr may well be regulated by mybpa <dig> in peach, while myb <dig> and myb <dig> are both good candidates for controlling fls expression . furthermore, transient expression of these candidate tfs showed that they could directly and differentially regulate promoters of the biosynthetic genes for peach polphenolics . the expression profiles of myb <dig>  bhlh <dig> and mybpa <dig> are consistent with these tfs regulating anthocyanin and proanthocyanidins in a complex composed of both activators and repressors, as observed in arabidopsis <cit> .

this regulatory complex, composed of myb <dig>  bhlh <dig> and wd <dig>  might control the biosynthesis of the anthocyanin in peach, and the competing presence of mybpa <dig> may explain the induction of flavan-3-ols. evidence for this comes from peach flesh, where no myb <dig> expression was detected , yet abundant expression of mybpa <dig> and all the genes except ufgt is seen . there is accumulation of flavan-3-ols suggesting a functioning pathway until at least ldox. peach mybpa <dig> was shown to be able to activate the dfr and lar promoters .

light-induced anthocyanin accumulation in peach skin is regulated by myb-bhlh complex
a previous study conducted by kataoka and beppu.,  <dig>  <cit>  showed that anthocyanin accumulation in peach peel was enhanced by uv light. our expression analyses of the ufgt, myb <dig>  and bhlh <dig> genes in the peel of ‘stark red gold’ nectarines under different light conditions suggest that the regulatory complex described above might be responsive to environmental stimuli .

flavonol accumulation was not significantly affected by light, although the 72 hour treatment may be too short for this compound class. the accumulation of anthocyanin in the peel of the light-exposed fruit correlated with enhanced transcript levels of all the assayed genes. in particular, the myb <dig> gene was the most strongly responsive to the light, with transcripts not detectable in the fruit kept in the dark and 30-fold more abundant in the light-exposed fruit compared to the fruit at harvest time. these results suggest that anthocyanin biosynthesis was not activated in the fruit kept in the dark because of the absence of myb <dig>  in the light-exposed fruit, instead, abundant myb <dig> might be able to form the protein complex for the induction of the ufgt expression even in the presence of repressors such as myb <dig> and myb <dig> , as suggested by matsui et al.,   <cit>  in studies using arabidopsis. in arabidopsis the repressor atmybl <dig> is involved in a positive regulatory loop with the bhlh tt <dig> and r2r <dig> myb pap <dig>  <cit> , so up-regulation of peach myb <dig> by the activation complex may also be occurring.

CONCLUSIONS
the patterns of accumulation of flavonols, flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins in developing ‘stark red gold’ nectarines suggest that the biosynthesis of these phenolic compounds is differentially regulated in peach/nectarine fruit. the expression levels of the main flavonoid biosynthetic genes confirmed this hypothesis. the ufgt gene transcript level correlates with anthocyanin accumulation in peach fruit, whereas the patterns of expression of all the other biosynthetic genes correlate with the concentration of flavan-3-ols. these patterns of gene expression might be explained by the involvement of different transcription factors. in particular, we showed that a regulatory complex composed of a myb, bhlh <dig> and wd <dig> controls promoters of polyphenolic biosynthetic steps in peach fruit, activating ufgt  or lar  gene transcription.

the characterization of these transcription factors involved in anthocyanin regulation provides essential information for peach fruit breeding programs with the final aim of selecting new cultivars with improved aesthetical and nutritional properties.
