BACKGROUND
pre-mrna splicing of eukaryotes requires three basic signals  for the recognition of introns. the splicing motifs are the 5' intron end  and the 3' intron end , and the branch site. the splicing motifs at the 5' and 3' splice sites, known as "ag|gtragt"  and "12-17nag|g"   <cit> . a human expressed sequence tag-based study showed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of introns are flanked by gt-ag and gc-ag dinucleotides , respectively  <cit> . other types of splice dinucleotides are also found in the human genome; these are at-ac and others   <cit> . irrespectively of these variations at the splice dinucleotides, there are two well-studied splicing mechanisms  <cit> . one mechanism utilizes a major spliceosome, an assembly of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles . the other mechanism uses the minor spliceosome, consisting of u <dig>  u <dig>  u4atac, u <dig>  and u6atac, instead. thus, most of exons are flanked by the virtually "invariant" gt and ag dinucleotides   <cit> . other additional splicing motifs, such as enhancers and silencers located in exons and introns have vast variety in motif signals and locations, but contribute to splicing fidelity.

some single base-pair substitutions occurring at the "invariant" splice dinucleotides cause alteration of splice patterns and are associated with serious diseases, for example, nf <dig>  <cit> , gstm <dig>  <cit> , cyclin d <dig>  <cit> , nudt <dig>  <cit> , and ldlr  <cit> , . the human genome mutation database  at the institute of medical genetics in cardiff  <cit>  has annotated a total of  <dig> entries for mutations in the vicinity of splice sites, which include  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> entries for mutations at splice dinucleotides at sites '+1', '+2', '-2', and '-1', respectively  <cit> . the databases dbass <dig>  <cit>  and dbass <dig>  <cit>  contain  <dig> and  <dig> details of aberrant splice sites, respectively  <cit> , which are generated as a result of disease-causing mutations in humans.

while other single base-pair substitutions at splicing dinucleotides are known to be maintained as single nucleotide polymorphisms  in human populations  <cit> , the question is: "what determines whether a single base-pair substitution at a splice dinucleotide will be maintained as a snp or eliminated from the population?"

to address this question, we evaluated snps at splice dinucleotides  in the context of selective pressure in the course of evolution. generally, functional constraints on exons differ between alternatively spliced exons  and constitutively spliced exons . ases are subject to relaxed negative selective pressure, which is suggested by their significantly higher ka/ks values compared with other exons  <cit> . this relaxation is the most fundamental conceptual constituent of exon creation via alternative splicing  and was first proposed at the time of the discovery of the exon/intron structure in the 1970s  <cit> . recent studies revealed that as is an important mechanism for creating new exons  <cit>  and that accelerated accumulation of snps at additional splicing motifs after gene duplication enhances exon generation  <cit> .

current advances in genome informatics and comparative genomics demonstrate that ases can be sub-divided into two contrasting categories. when ases are classified as conserved or non-conserved in exon structure, low synonymous rates are characteristic of conserved ases but not of those with non-conserved exonic structure  <cit> . moreover, when they are classified as boundary-shifting  ases or non-boundary shifting  ases , complex ases are under stronger selection pressure at the amino acid level but less pressure at the rna level than cses, while reverse trends were observed in simple ases  <cit> . these opposite evolutionary effects between different as patterns have been discussed as a key role of as in the 'switch-like' regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

if it is supposed that sdsnps are related to variation within populations in the regulation of gene expression through alterations in splicing patterns, the evolutionary profiles of sdsnp may differ between sdsnps flanking ases  and those flanking cses .

here, we extracted the sdsnps from all human genes, and evaluated them by comparing flanking exon properties between ases or cses. each group was subsequently divided into three subgroups according to exon conservation status between human and mouse, namely transcript-conserved, genome-conserved, and non-conserved . we found that sdsnps exist in the human genome with high allele frequencies, and with no significant difference in flanking exon properties between ases and cses. moreover, we also found that these sdsnps are prone to be maintained at the splice dinucleotides of newly generated exons. these results suggest that sdsnps are associated with relaxed selection pressure for newly generated exons.

RESULTS
validated snps at splice sites
we surveyed  <dig>  <dig> transcripts, defined by the h-invitational database   <dig>   <cit> , containing  <dig>  <dig> ases and  <dig>  <dig> cses  classified on the basis of information on exon usage  determined by h-dbas  <cit>  . the numbers of splice sites counted after mapping these transcripts on the genome were  <dig>  <dig> ,  <dig>  <dig> , and  <dig>  <dig>  in ases, cses, and total exons, respectively.

snp distribution and density at splice dinucleotides
we calculated the proportions of snp sites among the total sites at splice dinucleotides. these were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  for ae dinucleotides, ce dinucleotides, and intron regions, respectively. the densities of sdsnps in both ae and ce dinucleotides were significantly lower than that in introns, as is generally known . on the other hand, there was no significant difference between snp density for sdsnps at ae and ce dinucleotides .

1) average heterozygosity of sdsnps.

2) density of snps in splice dinucleotides. note that the snp density in intron regions is  <dig> %.

3) number of transcripts whose splice sites satisfy the gt-ag rule with the predicted allele/number of transcripts performed allele prediction assuming ld with the nearest csnp. see process  <dig> in figure  <dig> 

4) average score of splice sites with the predicted alleles meeting the gt-ag rule. splice scores were calculated using the maxent program.

5) average differences in score between the two splice sites from the two alleles of each sdsnp.

conservation of exons flanked by snps
we examined the conservation statuses of exons flanked by sdsnps by aligning genome sequences with full-length transcripts of human and mouse. the conservation statuses of exons flanked by sdsnps are available for  <dig> sdsnps . these exons flanked by sdsnps were classified into three categories according to whether exon and genome sequences are conserved between mouse and human, i.e., transcript-conserved, genome-conserved, and non-conserved . the proportions of these three categories were compared between exons flanked by sdsnps  and all exons in the human . the proportion of non-conserved exons was dramatically increased when exons were flanked by sdsnps  vs. all , χ <dig> =  <dig> , p < 10- <dig>  total in figure 3). this tendency was also observed for both exon types when they were classified into ases and cses.

allele prediction and matching to the gt-ag rule
to predict the alleles of sdsnps for each transcript, we searched another snp located in the transcribed region  and combined both alleles of these two snps, supposing that linkage disequilibrium  held between them and that the combination of alleles observed in the bac sequences used for the reference genome was a haplotype . before applying this prediction to sdsnps, we predicted alleles of all transcripts in h-invdb and found that  <dig> % of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> ce dinucleotides and  <dig> % of  <dig>  <dig> ae dinucleotides followed the gt-ag rule. we could predict alleles in  <dig> out of  <dig> transcripts with sdsnps at ae dinucleotides and in  <dig> out of  <dig> transcripts with sdsnps at ce dinucleotides . within these, we observed that the predicted alleles of the snps satisfied the gt-ag rule in  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts with sdsnps at ae and ce dinucleotides, respectively . in this process, we defined sdsnps as "constantly consistent" when only one allele of sdsnp was predicted to be consistent with the gt-ag rule in every transcript. sdsnps whose predicted allele was inconsistent with the rule in every transcript were defined as "constantly inconsistent." when both alleles of a sdsnp were predicted , the sdsnp was defined as "both cases." the six sdsnps at ce dinucleotides were predicted to be "both cases;", accordingly, these six sdsnps were counted in both categories--consistent and inconsistent with the gt-ag rule. no "both cases" were predicted in sdsnps at ae dinucleotides . consequently,  <dig> sdsnps at ce dinucleotides were placed in three categories according to whether their predicted alleles satisfied the gt-ag rule; there were  <dig> sdsnps with both alleles,  <dig> sdsnps with constantly consistent alleles, and  <dig> sdsnps with constantly inconsistent alleles . among sdsnps in ae dinucleotides,  <dig> and  <dig> were predicted to have constantly consistent alleles and constantly inconsistent alleles, respectively . dinucleotide patterns obtained by the prediction of the snp alleles are presented in table  <dig>  in ae dinucleotides, the most abundant non-canonical dinucleotide pattern was gt-ac, which was found in three transcript-snp pairs involved in three snps . in ce dinucleotides, the most abundant non-canonical dinucleotide patterns were gt-tg and gt-aa, which were found in  <dig> transcript-snp pairs and  <dig> snps, respectively . the widely known non-canonical splice dinucleotide gc-ag was observed in one out of  <dig>  and seven out of  <dig>  transcript-snp pairs not satisfying the gt-ag rule at ae and ce dinucleotides, respectively.

1) only a single allele is predicted for all transcripts. this includes all snps flanked by as exons.

2) both alleles were predicted depending on transcript. this was found only in constitutive exons.

comparison of splice site scores
the observation that more predicted alleles followed the gt-ag rule at ae dinucleotides  than at ce dinucleotides  may suggest that recognition of cse is robust against snps at their dinucleotides, while recognition of ase is sensitive to snps . we checked whether exon strength of ases was generally weaker than that of cse, and whether this explains the observation.

the differences in splice site scores between two alleles for each snp are shown in figure  <dig>  the sdsnps for which both alleles were predicted showed slightly lower differences than others, although differences between other categories were not significant.

we did not find any evidence to suggest that multiple sdsnps interact with each other to maintain exon strength. first, exons flanked by multiple sdsnps and introns with a sdsnp at both ends were not observed. second, a splice dinucleotide located in two consecutive sdsnps  was observed; however, these did not affect our analysis because the predicted haplotype did not follow the gt-ag rule, i.e., the aa haplotype was predicted at the 3' splice site.

discussion
the snp dataset includes validated snps only . the heterozygosities of these selected snps indicate that most of them are common snps ; the average heterozygosities of sdsnps in ae and ce dinucleotides were  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively ; the difference was not significant . the snp validation and heterozygosity data therefore suggest that snps observed in sdsnps are not mutations related to serious disease but polymorphisms that are maintained in the human population.

all comparisons of various properties of the sdsnps, including average heterozygosity, snp density, the ratio of predicted alleles satisfying the gt-ag rule, and splice scores using the predicted allele, show no significant differences between ases and cses . this suggests that sdsnps are maintained regardless of whether the flanking exon is of the ase or cse type.

we mapped  <dig> sdsnps in the human genome by searching the total human transcriptome. it is worth noting that  <dig>  of these sdsnps mapped to ce dinucleotides, and  <dig> sdsnps  mapped to ae dinucleotides . the  <dig> sdsnps mapped to ae dinucleotides suggests that these sdsnps are potential candidates for as polymorphisms, which are snps that alter the splicing pattern  <cit> . in contrast to sdsnps at ae dinucleotides, it is an intriguing discovery that sdsnps exist at ce dinucleotides: this means that exons adjacent to these snps would be recognized constitutively regardless of allele. one explanation for the existence of sdsnps at ce dinucleotides is that they represent an inconsistency between the definition of cse based on publicly available human transcript data and on diversity in exon usage, which is affected by cell or tissue type, developmental stage, external stimuli  <cit> , and genetic variation  <cit> . the number of ases is increasing as detection methods develop  <cit> . because we defined cses based on publicly available human transcript data, our cse category may include some ases if defined according to deep sequencing technology. moreover, the number of specimens used for the current full-length cdna data is smaller than that for snp surveys in the dbsnp database. this may also lead to a difference between our definition of ases and that after taking polymorphism into consideration. thus, cses are defined arbitrarily and vary with the amount of transcript data, which means that the ases in our dataset are likely to be highly alternatively spliced but that the cses are not necessarily constitutive. comparison between genome and transcript sequences using common numerous specimens may resolve this uncertainty.

another explanation is that cse is robust against snps at their splice dinucleotides because of an unknown mechanism that can work even if the gt-ag rule is partially violated. u1-independent splicing may be an example that supports this explanation  <cit> . although the detailed mechanism of u1-independent splicing is unclear and further research is needed, hf1γ intron  <dig>  whose 5' splice site sequences are different from the consensus sequence at positions - <dig> and + <dig>  spliced out without u <dig> snrnp. in this way, the 5' splice sites of these cses may be relaxed from selective pressure, which leads to maintenance of the sdsnps at ce dinucleotides.

our observation that the proportion of non-conserved exons was higher than that of conserved exons when the exons were flanked by sdsnps suggests a relationship between exons with sdsnps and newly generated exons . a question arises whether maintained sdsnps lead to the generation of new exons, or whether newly generated exons bring about the maintenance of new flanking sdsnps. previous studies reported a lower degree of conservation of ases than cses and constructed models in which exons were generated as ases  <cit> . a previous study using the same datasets as the present study also showed that a limited proportion  of as variants was conserved between human and mouse  <cit> . taking account of these, it is unlikely that as many cses are generated as ases. consequently, our finding of no significant difference between ases and cses regarding sdsnps suggests only a low possibility that sdsnps lead to the generation of new exons. instead, newly generated exons can be considered to serve additional functions and to be subject to relaxed selective pressure, in accord with the relaxation that occurs with duplicated genes   <cit> . our results suggest that newly generated exons allow the maintenance of flanking sdsnps because of relaxed selective pressure on these exons.

CONCLUSIONS
we found  <dig> validated sdsnps in the dbsnp database that were consistent with the gt-ag rule at either allele. proportion of non-conserved exon was higher when the exons were flanked by sdsnps. we found no significant difference in the properties of sdsnps between the two types of flanking exon . this includes average heterozygosity, snp density, the proportion of predicted alleles satisfying the gt-ag rule, and scores for splice sites formed with predicted alleles.

the sdsnps flanking ases can be explained by snps that alter the splicing pattern by their alleles, while the existence of sdsnps flanking cses requires an explanation for constitutive splicing even when an expressed allele violates the gt-ag rule. although this may be explained by the arbitrariness of the definition of the cse, which varies among dataset, it suggests that a novel splicing mechanism makes cses robust against sdsnps, such as u1-independent splicing.

taking account of previous studies suggesting an exon generation model through ases, there is little likelihood that sdsnps provide as much opportunities to generate cses as ases. our finding of similar properties of sdsnps between ases and cses does not suggest the possibility that sdsnps are exon generators. instead, the increased proportion of non-conserved exons found in exons flanked by sdsnps suggests the hypothesis that sdsnps are maintained at the splice dinucleotides of newly generated exons whose negative selection pressures are relaxed.
