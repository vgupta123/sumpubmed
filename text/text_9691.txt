BACKGROUND
cytokinins regulate various plant growth and developmental processes, including cell division, apical dominance, chloroplast biogenesis, leaf senescence, vascular differentiation, photomorphogenic development, shoot differentiation in tissue cultures and anthocyanin production, primarily by altering the expression of diverse genes  <cit> . the recent genetic and molecular studies in plants have suggested the involvement of two-component sensor-regulator system in cytokinin signal perception and transduction, comprising sensor histidine kinase  proteins, histidine phosphotransfer  proteins, and effector response regulator  proteins  <cit> . such signal transduction systems, once thought to be restricted to prokaryotes, have also been found in many eukaryotes, including yeast, fungi, slime molds and higher plants  <cit> . in arabidopsis, proteins with homology to all the elements of two-component system have been identified  <cit> .

the analysis of arabidopsis genome revealed the existence of  <dig> putative response regulator genes  <cit> . based on the predicted protein domain architecture and amino acid composition, the response regulators have been broadly categorized into three distinct families: type-a, type-b and pseudo-response regulators. the type-a response regulators are relatively small, containing a receiver domain along with small n- and c-terminal extensions  <cit> . the type-b response regulators comprise a receiver domain fused to the dna-binding domain and are supposed to be transcriptional regulators  <cit> . the pseudo-response regulators share significant sequence similarity with the receiver domain of other response regulators but the invariant d-d-k motif is not present  <cit> . the pseudo-response regulators are also considered to be the elements of the circadian clock in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> .

the type-a response regulator genes in arabidopsis  are rapidly and specifically induced by exogenous cytokinin, although with varying kinetics, and have been characterized as primary cytokinin response genes  <cit> . the transcription of type-a arr genes is regulated in part by type-b arrs  <cit> . some of the type-a arrs perform partially redundant functions, acting as negative regulators of cytokinin responses by a feedback mechanism  <cit> . in contrast, arr <dig> was claimed to be a positive regulator of cytokinin signaling because its over-expression enhanced the cytokinin responsiveness of transgenic arabidopsis plants  <cit> . however, the loss-of-function mutant did not reveal a positive role for arr <dig> in cytokinin signaling  <cit>  and this discrepancy remains to be resolved. the tissue distribution of arr <dig> overlaps to a large extent with that of phytochrome b  and it has been found to interact with n-terminus of phyb to stabilize its active form  <cit> . the transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing arr <dig> are specifically hypersensitive to red light  <cit> , indicating that arr <dig> may be involved in integrating red light and cytokinin signaling.

the type-a response regulators have been isolated and characterized from maize  <cit> . however, there is no report on the characterization of any type-a response regulator from other monocot species, although several est/cdna sequences are available in the databases. here, we report the identification and analysis of type-a response regulator gene family in rice , the model monocot plant. the exon-intron organization, chromosomal distribution and sequence homology have been analyzed for all ten members. the osrr genes express differentially in various organs examined, and also in response to light. the application of exogenous cytokinin induced osrr genes in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. evidence has also been provided for a probable role of osrr <dig> in abiotic stress signaling.

RESULTS
identification of type-a response regulators in rice
the information on rice genomic sequence  <cit>  provides a powerful tool to identify putative homologous proteins by database searches with genes of known function from other organisms. in an attempt to identify type-a response regulators in rice, the whole rice genome, dynamically translated in all reading frames, was analyzed employing tblastn search, using arabidopsis type-a response regulator proteins as query. this search identified a total of ten genes showing high sequence similarity with the arabidopsis type-a response regulators. these predicted proteins contain a characteristic receiver domain  with short n- and c-terminal extensions and were designated as oryza sativa response regulator  proteins. we amplified  and sequenced nine osrr cdnas . their sequences were confirmed by comparison with the corresponding genomic sequences. the cdna sequences have been deposited in the genbank, and their accession numbers, predicted protein length and genomic locus are given in table  <dig> 

exon-intron organization and chromosomal distribution
a comparison of the full-length cdna sequences  with the corresponding genomic dna sequences  showed that the coding sequence of majority of the osrr genes  are disrupted by  <dig> introns , suggesting their origin from a common ancestral gene with a classical pattern of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. however, variations in their basic gene structure were observed for other members, implicating gain  or loss  of introns. the highly conserved intron phasing and the position of introns with respect to their amino acid sequences  also indicate their evolution from the same ancestral gene by exon shuffling  <cit> .

the bac  or pac  clones carrying the genes for osrr proteins were identified . the chromosome map positions of bac/pacs given in centimorgans  from top of the chromosome, and the nearest marker to each osrr gene are indicated in table  <dig>  the ten osrr genes were found to be distributed on  <dig> of the  <dig> rice chromosomes . three osrr genes are present on chromosome  <dig>  two on chromosome  <dig>  and one each on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the distribution of osrr genes on rice chromosomes did not reveal evident clusters. however, osrr <dig> and osrr <dig> are present on the duplicated block between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

sequence analysis
the type-a rrs are mainly composed of a receiver domain with short n- and c-terminal extensions  <cit> , essentially similar to the e. coli response regulator  chey involved in chemotaxis, and lack a typical output domain. all the osrr proteins also contain the highly conserved lys and two asp residues  in the receiver domain . pairwise analysis of the full-length osrr protein sequences indicates that the overall identities range from 28% to 71% . however, the amino acid identity within the receiver domain reaches up to 95%. the receiver domain of type-a rrs in arabidopsis also showed 60% to 93% identity among them but less than 30% with that of type-b rrs. the predicted amino acid sequences of n- and c-terminal extensions of osrr proteins are more variable , like arabidopsis rr proteins  <cit> . the c-terminal extensions of arr <dig> and arr <dig> were shown to be responsible for their nuclear localization  <cit> . the rice type-a response regulators, osrr <dig>  osrr <dig>  osrr <dig>  osrr <dig> and osrr <dig>  also possess c-terminal extensions rich in acidic and charged residues . however, osrr <dig> and osrr <dig> have n-terminal extensions rich in gly and asp residues . these n- and c-terminal variable regions may play a role in their localization to different cellular compartments.

to examine the phylogenetic relationships of rice, maize, and arabidopsis type-a response regulators, an unrooted tree was constructed from alignments of their full-length protein sequences . the osrr proteins formed four sister pairs . this pairing of type-a rrs is consistent with recent evolutionary duplications postulated to have occurred in the rice genome  <cit> . the type-a response regulators in arabidopsis also formed five sister pairs and all of them were found to be located on homologous duplicated chromosomal segments  <cit> . thus, it is remarkable that the duplication of the sister pairs of type-a response regulator genes is associated with chromosomal block duplications in both rice and arabidopsis. recently, the extensive duplication and preferential retention of early auxin-responsive aux/iaa genes have been reported in both arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . the retention of the duplicated type-a response regulator genes in rice  also supports the idea that the genes involved in transcription and signal transduction have been preferentially retained in arabidopsis  <cit> . also, most of the osrrs clustered together alongwith maize rrs , in clades distinct from arabidopsis rrs  . in an earlier study with arabidopsis rrs, a phylogenetic analysis, including only a few of the monocot rrs, revealed that the type-a arrs fall into clades distinct from rice and maize  <cit> . the present study corroborates this observation and strengthens the view that the progenitor of monocots and dicots probably had only a small family of rrs and the expansion occurred subsequently, in both monocots and dicots, by gene duplication.

organ-specific expression of osrr genes
to examine the expression pattern of each osrr gene in different plant organs, and to assess the effect of light, quantitative real-time pcr analysis was performed with total rna isolated from etiolated seedlings, green seedlings, green shoots, roots, mature leaves, and flowers. the transcripts of all the osrr genes were detected in various organs examined but they displayed a complex expression pattern . most of the osrr genes were expressed at relatively higher level in mature tissues . the expression of osrr genes was also higher in roots , which is essentially similar to most of the arrs  <cit> . the transcript levels of osrr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were significantly higher in etiolated seedlings as compared to green seedlings . however, osrr <dig> exhibited higher expression in green seedlings. interestingly, in a recent study, the arr mutants in arabidopsis exhibited altered red light sensitivity  <cit> . also, arr <dig> has been found to interact with phytochrome b and stabilize its active form  <cit> . these results suggest that osrr genes exhibit overlapping and differential expression patterns, playing predominant roles in specific organs and may also be involved in light signal transduction.

osrrs represent primary cytokinin response genes
cytokinin regulates the expression of a large number of genes including type-a response regulators in arabidopsis and maize  <cit> . to study the effect of cytokinin on the transcript levels of individual osrr genes, the light-grown rice seedlings were treated with exogenous cytokinin for various durations over a  <dig> h period, and real-time pcr analysis was performed. consistent with the results reported earlier with arabidopsis  <cit> , the steady-state transcript levels of osrr genes were elevated within  <dig> min of exogenous cytokinin application . the kinetics of induction with cytokinin was similar for most osrr genes, with the transcript levels reaching its maximum in  <dig> h, and declining thereafter. there was, however, no significant change in the transcript abundance of osrr <dig> and  <dig> following cytokinin treatment . the rapid induction of type-a arrs by exogenous cytokinin has been shown to mediate a feedback mechanism, which decreases the sensitivity of the plant to the hormone, indicating that type-a rrs act as negative regulators of cytokinin-induced responses  <cit> . the type-b rrs are the transcription factors that are involved in the transcriptional activation of the type-a response regulators in response to cytokinins  <cit> .

many primary response genes, such as auxin-induced aux/iaa genes, are induced in the absence of de novo protein synthesis  <cit> . the genes encoding type-a rrs in arabidopsis have also been described as the primary cytokinin response genes  <cit> . to determine whether the osrr genes also belong to the same category, their induction by cytokinin was examined in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide . the steady-state transcript levels of most of the osrr genes increased  on treatment with cycloheximide, suggesting that the transcription of these genes is regulated by a short-lived repressor protein. the increase in transcript abundance  of rice aux/iaa genes examined   <cit>  in the same rna samples , confirmed that cycloheximide treatment was biologically effective in our experiments. further, cycloheximide failed to block the induction of these genes by cytokinin; the transcript levels of osrr genes were higher in the samples treated with bap in the presence of cycloheximide as compared to bap alone . these results suggest that osrr genes constitute a class of primary cytokinin response genes.

the expression of osrr genes in response to other plant hormones, including auxin, brassinosteroid, gibberellin and ethylene, was also examined. however, no significant effect of these hormones could be detected on the steady-state transcript levels of osrr genes , indicating their role primarily in cytokinin signaling.

expression of osrr genes under stress conditions
it has been claimed earlier that the expression of some of the type-a response regulators in arabidopsis is induced by different environmental stresses such as drought, salinity and low temperature  <cit> . to investigate, whether some of the osrr genes are also involved in stress responses, their expression levels were examined by real-time pcr analysis of the rna isolated from young rice seedlings subjected to various abiotic stress treatments. the expression of a majority of osrr genes was not significantly altered under stress , with the notable exception of osrr <dig>  the expression of osrr <dig> gene was induced to significant levels by salt, dehydration and low temperature treatments , and results were reproducible. this indicates that osrr <dig> may play an important role in abiotic stress signaling in rice, besides acting as a component in cytokinin signaling. it is noteworthy here that a transmembrane hybrid-type histidine kinase, ahk <dig>  closely related to cytokinin receptors, is a putative osmosensor in arabidopsis  <cit> .

what are the probable functions of osrr proteins?
the type-a rrs in arabidopsis have been shown to act as the negative regulators of cytokinin signaling with partially redundant functions  <cit> . in addition, some of these arrs and other elements of the two-component sensor-regulator phosphorelay participate in cross-talk between cytokinin and light signaling  and also with the gaseous hormone ethylene  <cit> . the role of one of the type-a rrs, i.e. arr <dig>  has also been ascribed in red light mediated photomorphogenesis  <cit> . in fact, arr <dig> physically associates with phytochrome b to prolong the stability of its active conformation, pfr, and accentuates red light signaling. the role of type-b arrs  has also been envisaged in a cross-talk between ethylene and cytokinin signaling, although they may regulate these components differentially to control diverse plant processes  <cit> . to have an inkling about the functions of osrr genes, the rice tos <dig> insertion mutant database  <cit>  providing the phenotype of rice tos <dig> retrotransposon insertion mutants  <cit>  was accessed using the blast program. we could identify insertion mutants corresponding only to osrr9/ <dig> gene ; it was difficult to demarcate whether the sequence flanking the tos <dig> insertion represents osrr <dig> or osrr <dig> because of more than 99% similarity between them. despite the fact that osrr <dig> and osrr <dig> genes are so similar and may function redundantly, the phenotype of the insertion mutants  showed dwarfism, sterility, lesion mimic and vivipary. it can thus be speculated that osrr9/ <dig> genes may quantitatively affect different cellular processes influenced by both light and cytokinin. a detailed analysis of the insertional mutants already available and rnai strategy for the remaining osrr genes will greatly help in elucidation of the precise role of these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of structural analyses of rice type-a rr proteins and their phylogenetic relationship with arrs will be helpful for their functional validation in rice. the organ-specific differential expression profile of osrr genes suggests that their products most likely perform diverse and overlapping functions in different cell types of rice. this study also reflects the role of osrr genes in both light and cytokinin signaling. the induction of osrr <dig> by different abiotic stress stimuli provides a molecular link between stress and cytokinin signaling as well. these results provide a foundation for future work on the elucidation of cellular functions of type-a response regulators in rice.
