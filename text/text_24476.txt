BACKGROUND
fish possess a large diversity in hearing sensitivities. several non-related groups of bony fish - often termed hearing specialists  <cit>  - have evolved mechanisms which transmit vibrations of air-filled cavities to the inner ear. these mechanisms enable them to detect the pressure component of sound, enhance their absolute hearing sensitivity and broaden the range of detectable frequencies up to several kilohertz  <cit>  versus several hundred hertz in species without such specialization. otophysi, a group of mainly freshwater fishes comprising the orders siluriformes , cypriniformes , characiformes  and gymnotiformes  are characterized by possessing such an accessory auditory structure, the weberian apparatus. the weberian apparatus consists of a chain of one to four ossicles that transmit oscillations of the swimbladder in the sound field directly to the inner ear. catfishes, numbering more than  <dig>  known species  <cit> , show a high diversity in the structure of the weberian apparatus and swimbladders. their hearing ability depends on swimbladder size as well as on the number of weberian ossicles  <cit> .

numerous studies have been conducted on the ontogenetic development of hearing and acoustic communication in mammals and birds , but only a few have been carried out in fishes. studies on the ontogeny of hearing in teleosts show varying results, ranging from no differences between two size groups of goldfish  <cit>  and various size groups of the zebrafish danio rerio  <cit> , no change in absolute thresholds but expansion of the detectable frequency range in the zebrafish  <cit> , up to an improvement of hearing abilities with size in the damselfish stegastes partitus  <cit> , the red sea bream pagrus major  <cit> , the labyrinth fish t. vittata  <cit>  and the toadfishes porichthys notatus  <cit>  and halobatrachus didactylus  <cit> . egner and mann  <cit>  found a slight decrease in hearing sensitivity at lower frequencies during ontogeny of the damselfish abudefduf saxatilis.

ontogenetic development of sound production in fishes seems to follow a consistent pattern. dominant frequencies of sounds decrease with size, for example in gurnards, mormyrids, croaking gouramis, damselfish and toadfish  <cit> . in most species tested in those studies, sound pressure levels, total duration of sounds as well as pulse periods within sounds increased.

the relationship between the development of hearing and sound production has been investigated in just two species so far. in both species - the anabantoid trichopsis vittata, a hearing specialist, and the non-related batrachoidid h. didactylus, a hearing generalist - the smallest size groups were unable to detect conspecific sounds  <cit> .

the present study is the first to investigate the ontogenetic development of hearing and sound production in an otophysine fish. the mochokid catfish synodontis schoutedeni david  <dig> emits stridulatory sounds in distress situations and during agonistic interactions by rubbing the spines of its pectoral fins in grooves of the shoulder girdle  <cit> . therefore, mochokids are frequently called squeakers. s. schoutedeni shows a well-developed unpaired swimbladder, three weberian ossicles and very good hearing sensitivities as compared to other species of catfish with a different swimbladder morphology  <cit> . we describe the developmental changes of temporal, spectral and intensity characteristics of stridulation sounds, analyse the development of auditory sensitivity with growth, and examine whether s. schoutedeni is able to communicate acoustically throughout its life history.

RESULTS
auditory sensitivity
auditory evoked potentials were recorded in all test groups between  <dig> hz and  <dig> khz. best hearing abilities were shown at frequencies between  <dig>  and  <dig> khz in all size groups, except the smallest group xxs. the largest group xl showed its lowest hearing threshold at  <dig>  khz , group xxs at  <dig> and  <dig> khz  . group xxs and xs showed poorest hearing abilities of all groups at  <dig>  khz. group xxs showed lowest hearing abilities of all groups from  <dig>  to  <dig> khz, but showed best hearing abilities of all groups at the highest frequency tested . group s had well-developed hearing abilities at low frequencies similar to larger size groups, but hearing sensitivity similar to that of group xxs and xs at the highest frequencies tested  . significant correlations between size and hearing thresholds existed at most frequencies. at lower frequencies , larger animals showed significantly better hearing, whereas at the highest frequencies tested  the opposite was the case: smaller animals had lower hearing thresholds. at  <dig> and  <dig> khz no correlation was evident .

mean hearing threshold values  of the six size groups of s. schoutedeni at each frequency tested. f = frequency; for exact size ranges see material and methods; group m was not tested at  <dig> khz.

sound production
stridulatory sounds were emitted during abduction  and adduction  of pectoral spines in all groups tested as soon as specimens were handled . swimbladder drumming sounds could not be detected or recorded. sound pressure level  increased with size up to  <dig> mm standard length  whereas no further increase was observed in larger-sized animals. spls of animals up to  <dig> mm sl were significantly lower than in larger specimens . in larger fish, no further increase in spl was evident . duration of adduction and abduction sound as well as pulse period  increased with size . the dominant frequency of sounds decreased significantly with size in fish larger than  <dig> mm sl, while no correlation was found in smaller ones . however, the dominant frequency of fish up to  <dig> mm sl was significantly higher than in larger fish . while bandwidth decreased with increasing size in fish up to  <dig> mm sl, no further decrease of bandwidth was observed in larger fish. the main energies of stridulation sounds produced by smaller specimens were more broad-banded than those of larger ones .

comparison between audiograms and sound spectra
all size groups showed best hearing abilities in frequency ranges where main energies of stridulation sounds were concentrated, and all size groups were able to detect conspecific sounds . thus, group xl detected sounds produced by group xxs and vice versa.

discussion
development of hearing
changes in hearing abilities have been reported in several fish taxa  <cit> . the present study provides the first evidence that auditory thresholds change during ontogeny in an otophysine fish species , results that are in contrast with previous studies on two species of cypriniforms, namely the goldfish  <cit>  and the zebrafish  <cit> . several potential explanations can be forwarded for this discrepancy among otophysines. first, different species have been investigated, which even belong to different orders, namely cypriniformes and siluriformes. furthermore, the authors of those studies did not calculate regressions of hearing abilities including all data from each individual study specimen, but instead compared the mean results of different size groups. furthermore, the size differences of the goldfish used as well as the range of frequencies tested might have been too small: the specimens were  <dig> to  <dig> mm sl and  <dig> to  <dig> mm sl, and the five test frequencies ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  hz. however, goldfish are able to detect sounds at least up to  <dig> khz  <cit> . in contrast to the goldfish study, higgs et al. measured early stages of zebrafish   <cit>  and found an extension of the maximum frequency detectable from a  <dig> hz upper limit in small specimens up to  <dig> khz in large ones but no change in absolute thresholds. they argued that the development of the weberian ossicles is responsible for this increase in the detectable frequency range. by contrast, zeddies and fay  <cit>  found in their study on the development of startle response in zebrafish no change of stimulus thresholds and frequency bandwidth to which the zebrafish responded from five days post fertilization to adult. similar to the observations of zeddies and fay  <cit>  in zebrafish, we did not observe a change in the range of detectable frequencies. based on coburn and grubach's  <cit>  study on the ontogeny of the weberian ossicles in several species of catfish we assume that all our tested animals possessed fully developed weberian ossicles. thus, the current study is the first to systematically demonstrate that auditory thresholds change with size in an otophysine fish , whereas the detectable frequency range does not change . auditory sensitivity increased at lower frequencies up to  <dig> khz and decreased at  <dig> and  <dig> khz.

some prior data on other catfish species are in agreement with these findings. in eight specimens of the loricariid catfish ancistrus ranunculus, the four smallest specimens tested detected sound stimuli at  <dig> khz, whereas only one of the larger ones responded to  <dig> khz stimuli at the maximum spl tested   <cit> . this indicates that smaller individuals of this loricariid had higher auditory sensitivities at the highest frequency tested. a similar observation can be made when comparing results of three studies on the pimelodid catfish pimelodus pictus  <cit> . the smallest specimens tested by wysocki et al.  <cit>  had better hearing abilities at the highest frequencies tested  than the largest fish tested by ladich  <cit>  .

these data indicate that smaller individuals within a given species of catfish may hear better at higher frequencies. one possible reason could be that smaller specimens produce sounds of higher frequencies and are adapted to detect sounds of similar-sized conspecifics. ladich and yan  <cit>  argued that the pygmy gourami, the smallest species investigated in their comparative study on labyrinth fishes , heard better at  <dig> to  <dig> khz than the larger two species. the authors argued that higher sensitivity at higher frequencies in the smallest species may reflect the higher resonance frequencies of their smaller-sized accessory hearing structures, the so-called suprabranchial chambers .

studies on the ontogenetic development of hearing in perciformes  and batrachoidiformes   <cit>  show a more consistent pattern. they reported mostly a moderate improvement of hearing with size, with one exception. kenyon  <cit>  observed a considerable  <dig> db increase in hearing sensitivity in the bicolor damselfish stegastes  partitus at the most sensitive frequency  during ontogeny. contrary to kenyon's results, egner and mann  <cit>  reported a decrease of hearing sensitivity in a representative of the same family. the sensitivity decreased in the sergeant major damselfish abudefduf saxatilis with growth at  <dig> and  <dig> hz. iwashita et al.  <cit>  observed an increase in hearing sensitivity in zero-, one- and two-year-old red sea bream pagrus major, in particular between  <dig> and  <dig> hz. in the croaking gourami trichopsis vittata, different trends were found at different frequencies during development of hearing  <cit> . hearing improved with size in the frequency range from  <dig> to  <dig>  hz, where the main energies of sounds were concentrated. an opposite trend was observed at  <dig> and  <dig> khz. this decrease in sensitivity at highest frequencies in t. vittata is in agreement with the catfish data of the current study. in both toadfish species tested so far, the plainfin midshipman  <cit>  and the lusitanian toadfish  <cit> , a small increase of hearing sensitivity with size was evident. in the lusitanian toadfish, hearing improved with growth at three out of seven frequencies tested.

development of sound production
whereas different trends were found in the development of auditory sensitivities in different species, the development of sound characteristics shows more similar patterns among teleosts. these patterns agree with the current data in synodontis schoutedeni.

the dominant frequency of sounds is negatively correlated with body size in representatives of all families investigated so far, for example, in pomacentrids - stegastes partitus, dascyllus albisella, amphiprion akallopisos, a. clarkii, a. frenatus, a. ocellaris,  <cit> , osphronemids - trichopsis vittata, t. pumila and t. schalleri  <cit> , sciaenids - cynoscion regalis  <cit> , triglids - eutrigla gurnardus  <cit> , and toadfishes - halobatrachus didactylus  <cit> . fine et al.  <cit>  found a decrease of center frequency in the ictalurid catfish ictalurus punctatus. in contrast, ladich  <cit>  reported such a correlation in only one out of six catfish species from three families. only in the doradid platydoras armatulus  did the dominant frequency decrease with size, while no such correlation was present in pimelodids and mochokids. the lack of a relationship might have been due to the difficulty of determining dominant frequencies in broad-band sounds and perhaps the small size differences of fish used in that study. in the present investigation, s. schoutedeni size differed more . a significant correlation between dominant frequency of sounds and size was found in animals larger than  <dig> mm sl. the decrease in dominant frequency may be an effect of longer pulse periods within sounds, and thus based on size-related changes in morphology  <cit> . however, these underlying structural changes seem not to apply to animals smaller than  <dig> mm in which dominant frequencies were significantly higher than expected by the linear regression. smaller individuals of s. schoutedeni showed a more evenly distributed sound energy than large individuals. the frequency band  <dig> db below the dominant frequency ranged from ca.  <dig>  to  <dig>  hz in smallest fish down to ca.  <dig> to  <dig>  hz in largest ones . the decrease in bandwidth was significant from the smallest size group up to  <dig> mm sl; no further change was observed in larger animals. no such relationship has been described in other species so far, although a closer examination of sounds of other species might yield similar results. the power spectra of sounds of three species of clownfishes amphiprion spp.  <cit>  indicate that such a relationship may also exist in other fish species.

the sound pressure level  of vocalizations increases with size in species from different taxa such as in the tigerfish therapon jarbua  <cit> , the osphronemid t. vittata  <cit> , the sciaenid c. regalis  <cit> , the toadfish h. didactylus  <cit> , and in the mochokid catfish s. schoutedeni . interestingly, while spls increased rapidly in animals below  <dig> mm sl, no further increase of spls occurred in the larger specimens . the amplitude of sounds depends on anatomical constraints and on how long and hard fish press the dorsal process of the pectoral spine against the groove of the shoulder girdle  <cit> . this could cause intraindividual variation of spls and a lack of correlation in larger animals.

temporal characteristics of sounds such as duration of abduction and adduction sounds and pulse period of sounds increase with size in s. schoutedeni. this can be explained by the growth of the dorsal process of the pectoral spine and the fact that a full pectoral sweep takes longer in larger fish than in a smaller one  <cit> . increases with size have also been observed for pulse period in the lusitanian toadfish  <cit> , pulse duration in weakfish  <cit> , and grunt duration in the grey gurnard  <cit> .

comparison between hearing abilities and spectra of stridulation sounds
in all tested size groups of s. schoutedeni, the main energies of stridulation sounds correspond to the most sensitive frequency range of hearing . despite some uncertainty of sound level measurements in aquaria as compared to free field conditions our data show that all groups are apparently able to detect sounds produced by specimens of the other groups, which is in contrast to prior findings in other teleost species. in croaking gouramis and lusitanian toadfish, individuals of the smallest size groups were probably unable to detect sounds produced by similar-sized conspecifics  <cit>  based on a comparison between absolute sound spectra and audiograms at a communication distance of  <dig> to  <dig> cm. the reason for this difference between s. schoutedeni and the latter two perciform species is two-fold: first, s. schoutedeni shows much higher hearing sensitivities than the other two species investigated, namely the croaking gourami and the lusitanian toadfish  <cit> . early stages of the mochokid catfish are more sensitive at the dominant frequencies of conspecific sounds than in the other two species. secondly, the spls of juveniles' sounds are much higher than those of juveniles of the other two species. thus, all squeaker catfish can detect sounds of conspecifics either uttered during agonistic intraspecific interactions or in a distress context  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the current study shows varied changes in auditory sensitivity during the ontogenetic development of s. schoutedeni. hearing sensitivities increase with growth in the frequency range where main energies of sounds are concentrated, whereas the opposite is the case in the highest tested frequencies . the ontogenetic development of sounds follows fish-typical patterns, namely an increase in sound level and duration, and a decrease in dominant frequency of sounds. contrary to previous studies, the present data show that the squeaker catfish can communicate with conspecifics of all size groups at short distances either during agonistic encounters or when being attacked by predators. these enhanced sound-detecting abilities of otophysines enable catfish to orient and communicate acoustically at much earlier stages of development.
