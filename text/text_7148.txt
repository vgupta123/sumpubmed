BACKGROUND
crohn's disease  is a chronic-relapsing inflammatory bowel disease  that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract. the incidence rate varies from  <dig> to  <dig> cases per  <dig> people per year and is still rising in some countries  <cit> . although the aetiology of cd remains elusive to date, it is widely accepted that several factors are involved in the onset or perpetuation of the disease. these factors include genetic and immunologic features that confer host susceptibility, and external or environmental factors such as microorganisms and lifestyle  <cit> . environmental factors play an important role because there is a low concordance between identical twins, both for cd and ulcerative colitis   <cit> . the involvement of microbes in the onset or perpetuation of inflammation has been extensively studied  <cit> . to date, some pathogens have been proposed as causative agents. in particular, adherent-invasive e. coli  is increasing in relevance because it has been reported to be more prevalent in cd patients than in controls in several countries . aiec strains have the ability to adhere to and to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vitro as well as to survive and replicate within macrophages without inducing host-cell death and promoting tumour necrosis factor  α release. no unique genetic sequences have been described for aiec, nor have specific genes of diarrhoeagenic pathovars been detected yet for aiec, but they do carry many virulence-associated genes characteristic of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli   <cit> . for that reason, aiec pathovar has been speculated to be closely related to expec pathovar.

in a previous work, we observed that some cd patients showed a high diversity of aiec subtypes associated to their intestinal mucosa  <cit> . in a given patient, we could detect up to  <dig> different clones as assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. on the other hand, aiec abundance, richness and diversity were lower in non-ibd controls. we hypothesized that the higher diversification of clones could be explained by a long-term colonization of aiec in cd. biofilm formation can be a way to persistently colonize the intestinal mucosa  <cit> , as has been reported for commensal microbiota in healthy subjects  <cit> . moreover, for certain organisms such as the species belonging to the uropathogenic e. coli pathovar  - which form intracellular biofilms  <cit>  - and to the enteroaggregative pathogenic e. coli pathovar  - which form thick biofilms that adhere to the apical side of enterocytes  <cit> -, active biofilm formation is feature of their pathogenesis. for that reason, the primarily aim of this work was to determine the biofilm formation capacity of aiec strains and non-aiec strains, both isolated from the intestinal mucosa.

we herein report a new phenotypic feature of the recently described aiec pathovar which is the ability to form biofilms in vitro. in addition, we illustrate those seropathotypes and phylotypes more frequently found amongst biofilm producers.

RESULTS
aiec strains are stronger biofilm producers than non-aiec strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa
the present study involved a collection of  <dig> e. coli strains,  <dig> of which  were classified as aiec by their ability to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells, and to survive and replicate within macrophages, as previously described  <cit>  .

abbreviators: cd: crohn's disease; uc: ulcerative colitis; c: non-ibd control, uti: urinary tract infection; ont: serogroup non-typeable; hnt: flagellar antigen non-typeable; h-: nonmotile strain; phylo.: phylogroup; at: atypical.

within the category of weak biofilm producers,  <dig> % of strains were non-aiec, whereas  <dig> % of moderate to strong biofilm producers were aiec . amongst these aiec strains,  <dig> % were strong biofilm producers, and  <dig> % were moderate biofilm producers . similar results were obtained when sbf index values were compared. as shown in figure  <dig>  the mean sbf index was higher in aiec strains than in non-aiec .

adhesion, invasion, intra-macrophage replication, and biofilm formation indices are specified. abbreviators: aiec: aiec phenotype ; i_adh: adhesion index; i_inv: invasion index; i_repl: replication index; sbf: specific biofilm formation index; bfc: biofilm formation category; w: weak biofilm producer; m: moderate biofilm producer; and s: strong biofilm producer.

interestingly, higher adhesion indices from both aiec and non-aiec strains correlated with higher sbf indices . moreover, the correlation was even stronger between the invasion and biofilm formation capacities of aiec strains . no correlation was observed with the ability of aiec strains to survive and replicate within macrophages .

nonmotile strains were unable to form biofilms and, amongst motile strains, those with h <dig> flagellar type showed the highest biofilm formation indices
an additional factor that was associated with biofilm formation was the motility of the strains. regardless of adhesion and invasion abilities, motile strains showed higher sbf indices than nonmotile strains . all strains producing moderate-strong biofilms were motile, whereas strains classified as weak biofilm producers were heterogeneous in their motility capacities. in concordance, the isogenic mutant lf82-Δflic which is nonmotile, non-flagellated and express only few type  <dig> pili, did not display the ability to form biofilms  in contrast to lf <dig> wild type .

moreover, sbf indices were specifically higher for the h <dig> serotype as shown in figure  <dig>  all h <dig> serotypes were moderate-strong biofilm producers. in contrast, only  <dig> out of  <dig>  of strains with other h types were classified within this category .

abbreviators: h-: nonmotile strains; h1: motile and h <dig> flagellar type; hx: motile and any flagellar type except h <dig> asignificance between h- and h1; bsignificance between h- and hx; csignificance between h <dig> and hx.

to determine whether motility and aiec-like phenotype were intrinsically related factors, the frequency of motile and nonmotile strains within aiec and non-aiec strains was calculated. although the majority of aiec strains were motile , no significant differences were observed in comparison to non-aiec strains . moreover, no interaction among these factors was detected by applying a factorial anova. therefore, motility and adherence/invasion capacity were independent factors associated with biofilm formation.

serogroups associated with higher biofilm producing abilities
as shown in figure  <dig>  o <dig>  followed by o <dig>  showed the highest mean sbf indices. regardless the aiec phenotype and origin of the strains , all the strains of o <dig> and o <dig> serogroup were found to be moderate-strong biofilm producers.

other serogroups with mean sbf that fell into the 'moderate' category were: o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  however, some strains that were unable to form biofilms were detected amongst these serogroups. for some serogroups such as o <dig> and o <dig> those strains classified as weak biofilm producers were particularly those nonmotile o2/o <dig> strains. in turn, strains with weak to strong biofilm formation abilities amongst the o <dig> strains belonged to a certain serotype  and this serotype was not present amongst the categories 'moderate' or 'strong' biofilm producers. nevertheless, very few strains have been analyzed for some of these serogroups  due to the nature of the strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa, thus no robust conclusions can be extracted for them.

distribution of virulence-associated genes and phylogroups within biofilm producers
of the  <dig> e. coli strains used in this study,  <dig>  harboured more than two virulence-associated genes in addition to fimh; thus, these strains are considered an extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli according to the definition of johnson et al  <cit> . virulence-associated gene distribution was similar between biofilm producers  and non-biofilm producers , with the exception of adherence factor sfa/focde  and the invasion-associated gene ibea , which were more prevalent in biofilm-forming strains .

although the e. coli collection studied was mainly composed of b <dig>  and d  phylotypes, significant differences were observed between the two categories of biofilm producers. as shown in table  <dig>  the b <dig> phylogroup was more frequent in moderate-strong biofilm forming strains , whereas a and d phylogroups were more frequent within weak biofilm producers.

discussion
in this work, we describe the biofilm formation capacity of a recently described pathovar, adherent-invasive e. coli , which is associated with crohn's disease. the main result was that aiec strains have stronger biofilm formation abilities than other e. coli strains isolated from the intestinal mucosa . the latter share genotypic and phenotypic traits with aiec  <cit>  but lack the properties described for the pathovar:  adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro,  survival and replication capacity within macrophages without causing host-cell death, and  induction of tnf-α release  <cit> . we also analyzed the relationship between biofilm formation, aiec phenotype, serotype, and phylogroup, and the presence of virulence-associated genes.

as observed by other authors  <cit> , motility was a crucial factor for biofilm formation because none of the nonmotile strains were able to form biofilms . this observation was further supported by the experiments performed with the isogenic mutant lf82-Δflic. moreover, all  <dig> strains with h <dig> flagellar antigen were moderate-strong biofilm producers, in contrast to  <dig> % of motile non-h <dig> types. therefore, h <dig> flagellar antigen conferred, either directly or indirectly, an advantageous trait to form biofilms. although motility was a necessary requirement for biofilm formation, it was not sufficient;  <dig> out of  <dig> motile strains were weak biofilm producers, indicating that additional factors are needed. in addition, strains with o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> serogroups were found amongst the biofilm producers, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> . interestingly, the highest mean sbfs index was achieved by four strains that belonged to the o <dig> serogroup, in particular the o83:h <dig> serotype, being all the strains classified as strong biofilm producers. this group included two aiec strains  and two non-aiec strains  and ecg- <dig>   <cit> .

some associations between biofilm-formation potential and some virulence-associated genes have been already described  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , the adhesin-coding gene sfa/focde was more frequently detected amongst biofilm producers. in addition, the gene ibea, required for invasion in meningitis/sepsis-associated e. coli   <cit> , was more prevalent amongst strong biofilm producers. interestingly, ibea, in conjunction with fimh and fimavmt <dig>  are virulence factors present in aiec strain lf <dig>  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses have shown that e. coli strains fall into four main phylogenetic groups  and that virulent expec strains mainly belong to group b <dig> and, to a lesser extent, group d, whereas most commensal strains belong to group a  <cit> . although b <dig> was the most abundant phylotype within the e. coli collection, b <dig> phylotypes were significantly more prevalent amongst moderate-strong biofilm producers than weak biofilm producers , which were enriched in a and d phylotypes . of note, b2+d phylotypes are also more prevalent amongst e. coli strains from patients with cd or ulcerative colitis than in non-ibd controls  <cit> .

the positive correlation between the levels of adhesion and invasion and the higher sbf indices lead to postulate that the machinery implicated to achieve the "aiec phenotype" could share some factors necessary for biofilm formation, such as type  <dig> pili and flagella. another possibility is that both processes could be related to a coordinated expression, for instance, by the envz/ompr regulatory system. rohlion et al  <cit>  recently proposed a model in which ompc, a porin regulated by envz/ompr, has been implicated in the adherence-invasiveness of aiec, and this system is also known to play an important role in biofilm formation  <cit> . the biofilm formation could also be dependent on the cyclic di-gmp concentration which was recently reported to regulate the expression of type  <dig> pili and flagella in aiec reference strain lf <dig>  <cit> .

biofilms in the human gut are thought to play an agonistic role with the host  <cit> , being necessary to achieve an homeostatic situation and appropriate gut physiology. nevertheless, previous studies have highlighted the increased biofilm formation in patients with cd with respect to control subjects  <cit> . moreover, the composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota is altered with respect to that of non-ibd controls  <cit> . it is widely accepted that the intestinal microbiota is essential to elicit the inflammation; however, the specific role of intestinal biofilms in cd is still uncertain. changes in the composition and abundance of mucosa-associated biofilms have been proposed either to play a role in the onset or perpetuation of cd  <cit>  or to be a consequence of the defective immune regulation in cd patients  <cit> . because we have analyzed the biofilm formation capacity of a collection of aiec and non-aiec strains using an in vitro method we can deduce that the ability of aiec to form biofilms is irrespective of host factors. however, in vivo experiments would give interesting insights into the pathogenesis of aiec in cd. biofilm formation of aiec in human gut, if confirmed, would confer to the pathovar an advantage for colonization of the intestine. consequently, given the pathogenic behavior of aiec, a more stable colonization would increase their probability of invading the intestinal epithelium and further trigger mucosal inflammation and, possibly, granuloma formation. in this sense, and speculatively, biofilm formation could contribute to aiec pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel phenotypic trait of aiec pathovar was described in this work. biofilm production ability of aiec strains could be an additional trait involved in their pathogenesis. further investigations to detect aiec specific genetic determinants involved in biofilm formation and to analyze the genetic regulatory processes are essential to fully understand aiec pathogenesis and elucidate a possible role of aiec in cd.
