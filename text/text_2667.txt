BACKGROUND
crude oil is a complex mixture of a range of different components like aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons , phenols, and a substantial amount of unknown compounds  <cit> . following an acute oil spill, waves, wind and sunlight will cause weathering of the oil, altering the appearance and composition of the oil dramatically and dynamically  <cit> . the weathering process generates oil-in-water dispersions, consisting of oil droplets in the water phase. micron-sized oil droplets will to a minimal degree resurface, and they will be a source of oil compounds for marine organisms through leakage and dissolution, as the chemical equilibrium for oil compounds between the water phase and the oil droplets continuously will vary. use of dispersants after an acute oil spill, as demonstrated by the extensive use of the dispersant corexit  <dig> during the deepwater horizon accident in the gulf of mexico in  <dig>  <cit> , will increase the amounts of oil droplets in the seawater column. the main purpose of using dispersant is to move the oil into the water column as oil dispersions which will dilute and biodegrade the oil more rapidly than if the oil was left on the surface  <cit> . more knowledge is needed on the fate and effects of oil droplets in the water column in terms of lifetime, adhesion to particles, dissolution rates and not at least their toxicity to sensitive marine organisms.

fish embryo and larvae are generally regarded to be particularly vulnerable to the toxic compounds in crude oil  <cit> . exposure studies carried out with pink salmon  and pacific herring  embryos after the exxon valdez accident showed that dissolved pahs alone  are sufficient for toxic impacts  <cit> . studying zebrafish , carls et al.  <cit>  exposed fish embryos in a physical barrier separating dissolved pah from oil droplets, and showed comparable biological responses to water containing either dissolved pah alone, or dissolved pah plus droplets. we recently evaluated the potential contribution of oil droplets to the toxicity of dispersed oil to first feeding atlantic cod  larvae  <cit> , and observed that it was mainly the water-soluble fraction of oil and not the oil droplets themselves that induced altered gene transcription of detoxifying enzymes in the fish larvae. from these studies it appears that oil droplets characteristics do not attribute to the toxic effects of pah and other components in crude oil to fish embryo and larvae, however, very little is known about whether or not chemically dispersed oil droplets have the same toxic effects as mechanistically dispersed oil droplets on fish larvae. most literature studies have compared the toxic effects of chemically and mechanically dispersed oil by comparing the toxicity of low energy water accommodated fractions  or high energy water accommodated fractions , with chemically-enhanced water accommodated fractions . such comparisons may be useful in terms of comparatively testing the impact of the dispersant application, however, in terms of oil exposure, the two approaches differ significantly. generation of ce-waf will increase the oil concentration in the water phase and cause formation of very small oil droplets which will persist for a longer period of time in the water phase compared to wsfs generated using the le-waf or he-waf approach. often there is no information given on the oil droplet characteristics . in other words, dispersions generated with equal energy input with and without dispersant therefore creates dispersions  differing in oil droplet size distribution, oil concentration and chemical composition of the water soluble fraction. using chemical dispersant it is the impossible to separate the toxic effects related to the presence of dispersant from secondary effects related to changes in oil concentration and chemical composition. using static or semi-static systems is expected to further enhance the differences due to size dependent oil droplet surfacing velocity in the two dispersions. one way of overcoming these problems in order to isolate the effect of the oil/dispersant interaction is to compare dispersions with similar oil concentrations and oil droplet size distributions with and without dispersant in a continuous flow system, and this is what has been done in the present work.

the aim of this work was to evaluate whether chemically dispersed  oil, generated so that it was comparable in terms of oil droplet characteristics and concentrations, induce the same transcriptional responses in fish larvae as mechanically dispersed  oil, or whether hydrocarbons in chemically dispersed oil droplets are more toxic due to the way the droplets are formed. transcriptional responses as a measure of toxicity were studied in atlantic cod larvae exposed to either chemically or mechanically dispersed oil droplets over a period of four days at the age of 10– <dig> days post hatch during the first-feeding life stage. the atlantic cod was selected because it inhabits waters with extensive oil and gas exploration on both sides of the north atlantic, and also because acute oil spills near spawning grounds may endanger local populations. for transcriptome-wide screening, a nimblegen microarray containing  <dig>  <dig> oligos was used. gene set enrichment analysis  and ingenuity pathway analysis  were applied for functional and pathway analysis. our hypothesis was that oil droplets should be expected to be equally toxic independent on the way they are generated, and that the use of dispersants does not work additive to the transcriptomic responses.

RESULTS
chemical analysis
the experimental setup is shown in figure 1a, while figure 1b shows the averaged values of cumulative size distributions  recorded at the outlet of the exposure vessels from the high exposure groups. figure 2a shows the exposure concentrations of ∑pahs. separations between naphthalenes, 2– <dig> ring pahs and 4– <dig> ring pahs are presented for all exposure groups . these concentrations are average of  <dig> samples analyzed by gc/ms . except for the mdl group, the ∑pah were significantly higher in the exposure groups compared to the control . the analyses also showed that the ∑pah levels were significantly higher in the low and medium concentration groups of chemically dispersed oil than in mechanically dispersed oil . thus, relatively comparable treatments of cod larvae with chemically and mechanically dispersed oil with respect to oil concentrations were obtained. similar size distributions of oil droplets for both dispersion types were confirmed with the particle characterization.


larvae survival
in general the mortality during the first feed period of cod larvae is expected to be high and the highest survival rate was  <dig> %  in the controls. the average lethality in all exposed groups was higher than that of the control groups and the lethality increased with increasing exposure concentration .

microarray screening
anova analysis of the microarray data yielded gene lists with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant affected genes in the low , medium  and high  groups of atlantic cod larvae exposed to chemically dispersed oil, respectively . the affected genes in cod larvae exposed to mechanically dispersed oil contrasted against the control were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively. figure  <dig> shows a venn diagram of the number of overlapping genes between the different exposure groups. based solely on the numbers of affected genes in the high exposure groups, the result indicates that oil dispersion that were mechanically dispersed mediated greater changes in gene transcription to the larvae than chemically dispersed oil. surprisingly few common genes were observed between the two high-exposure groups; only  <dig> common genes were observed in the mdh and cdh groups. the four groups exposed to the highest concentrations  shared only seven common genes, and all of these with annotations were related to the cytochrome p <dig> system , cyp1c <dig>  ahrr and two oligo sequences with unknown identity).


additional file  <dig> shows the gene lists generated with the anova analysis from the six groups of larvae , with sequence ids, sequence descriptions, gene names used for functional analysis, p-values and fold changes. cyp1a showed the strongest response in the larvae exposed to the highest concentrations of dispersed oil. according to the microarray data, cyp1a <dig> was  <dig> -fold up-regulated in larvae from the cdh group, whereas cyp1b <dig> was  <dig> -fold up-regulated. cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig> were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold up-regulated, respectively, in larvae from the mdh group. cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig> were also significantly up-regulated in cod larvae from the two medium concentration exposure groups, cdm and mdm. in larvae from the first group, cyp1a <dig> was  <dig> -fold up-regulated, while cyp1b <dig> was  <dig> -fold up-regulated. in larvae from the mdm group cyp1a <dig> was  <dig> -fold up-regulated, while cyp1b <dig> showed a  <dig> -fold up-regulation. a still significant up-regulation of cyp1a <dig>  was observed in cod larvae exposed to the lowest concentration of chemically dispersed oil droplets , but not in larvae exposed to the lowest concentration of mechanically dispersed oil droplets . in other words, based on the number of significantly differentially expressed transcripts and induction of the well-established biomarker cyp1a, the microarray data suggest that mechanically dispersed oil was slightly more toxic to the fish larvae compared to the chemically dispersed oil. also the data for the third most differentially regulated transcript in larvae from the cdh and mdh exposure groups, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor , points in the same direction. ahrr were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold up-regulated in larvae from the mdh group , according to two oligo sequences both annotated to this gene, whereas ahrr was significantly but only  <dig> -fold up-regulated in larvae from the corresponding cdh group.

less coherent results were obtained for the transcripts showing the highest degree of down-regulation. in the cod larvae exposed to the highest concentration of chemically dispersed oil , centromere protein i , deah  box polypeptide  <dig> , and timeless interacting protein  showed the strongest down-regulation . in cod larvae exposed to the highest concentration of mechanically dispersed oil , cell division cycle associated  <dig> , hemopexin  , and chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig>  showed the strongest down-regulation response . again, based on the degree of transcription fold changes, the microarray data suggest that mechanically dispersed oil mediated a slightly stronger response than chemically dispersed oil.

rt-qpcr analysis
in order to verify the microarray results, a set of transcripts were evaluated by rt-qpcr. in general, the quantitative real-time qpcr results were in line with the microarray data. based on  <dig> quantified transcripts showing significant effect analyzed with rt-qpcr, the correlation between the microarray data and rt-qpcr was r= <dig>  for the cdh group and r= <dig>  for the mdh group . figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the transcriptional levels of  <dig> genes quantified with rt-qpcr. of the evaluated transcripts, cyp1a showed to strongest response with a  <dig> -fold induction in larvae from the cdh group and a  <dig> -fold induction in larvae from the mdh group . in the medium-exposure groups, cyp1a showed a  <dig> -fold induction in larvae from the cdm group, and  <dig> -fold induction in larvae from the mdm group. rt-qpcr data for a set of evaluated transcripts and their significance are shown in figure  <dig>  also cyp1b <dig>  and cyp1c <dig>  showed significant responses to dispersed oil exposure, with cyp1b <dig> showing a stronger response than cyp1c <dig> in the two high-exposure groups. the ahrr transcript  was more strongly affected than the ahr <dig> transcript . the significant up-regulation of gst π  suggests that phase ii metabolism was affected in the cod larvae, while altered transcription of p <dig>  suggest that dispersed oil exposure may have mediated an effect on dna integrity. no significant effects of oil exposure were observed on the growth marker igf  or igfbp <dig> . ferritin  and hsp <dig>  transcription was significantly up regulated by dispersed oil treatment, while mcm <dig>  and cdca <dig>  were significantly down-regulated by the treatment.


functional pathway analysis
gene set enrichment analysis  and ingenuity pathway analysis  was used for functional analyses of the transcriptional data. additional file  <dig> shows the top ranked gene sets in larvae from all exposure groups compared to the control group. table  <dig> shows the gsea gene sets significantly affected comparing the two high-exposure groups directly . only the top-ranked gene sets are shown for each comparison. gsea of the microarray data showed that most significantly affected gene sets were observed in the cod larvae exposed mechanically dispersed oil droplets . the overall pattern of affected gene sets in cod larvae in the different exposure groups suggest that the way oil droplets are generated have an effect on toxicity in fish larvae. by comparing the alteration in gene transcription in cod larvae exposed to the highest concentrations of either chemically or mechanically dispersed oil directly, the chemically dispersed oil affected transcription of genes involved nucleosome regulation, i.e. genes encoding proteins participating in dna replication and chromatin formation and regulation of cell proliferation, whereas the mechanically dispersed oil mainly affected genes encoding proteins involved in proteasome-mediated protein degradation . compared to larvae in the control group, the gsea data showed that mechanically dispersed oil also mediated a general down-regulation of many transcripts in cod larvae in the mdh group.

ipa was used to evaluate whether or not chemically dispersed oil mediated a different toxic response compared to mechanically dispersed oil. since ipa only can map mammalian homolog identifiers, genecards ids were submitted for biological function and pathway analysis, using top blastx hits and assuming orthologous genes have the same function. for example, because fish often have two isoforms of many genes due to genome duplication, labeled a and b, mammalian homolog identifiers had to be used as input for the ipa analysis, without knowing the exact function of the separate teleostean isoforms. the number of mapped ids for ipa analysis in the different exposure groups were; cdh)  <dig> out of  <dig>  cdm)  <dig> out of  <dig>  cdl)  <dig> out of  <dig>  mdh)  <dig> out of  <dig>  mdm)  <dig> out of  <dig> and mdl)  <dig> out of  <dig> 

according to the ipa core analyses , using a maximum number of  <dig> molecules in each pathway, the top affected networks in the cod larvae exposed to the highest concentration of chemically dispersed oil  were “rna post-transcriptional modification, cellular assembly and organization, cell morphology” with a score of  <dig>  “dna replication, recombination, and repair, cell cycle, cancer” with a score of  <dig> and “lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry” with a score of  <dig>  the corresponding top affected pathways in the cod larvae exposed to mechanically dispersed oil were “rna post-transcriptional modification, cellular assembly and organization, cell morphology” with a score of  <dig>  “cellular function and maintenance, small molecule biochemistry, dna replication, recombination, and repair” with a score of  <dig>  and “lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, vitamin and mineral metabolism” with a score of  <dig> 

ipa-tox is a data analysis capability within ipa that delivers a focused toxicity assessment of input molecules using toxicogenomics approaches. table  <dig> shows the significant ipa-tox pathways in the six groups of cod larvae exposed to oil dispersants. the most significantly affected ipa-tox pathways in the high-exposure chemically dispersed oil data set  were “positive acute phase response proteins”, “aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling”, “cell cycle: g1/s checkpoint regulation”, “negative acute phase response proteins”, and “fatty acid metabolism” . in the larvae exposed to the highest concentration of mechanically dispersed oil , the top ipa-tox list included “negative acute phase response proteins”, “p <dig> signaling”, “liver proliferation”, “oxidative stress”, and “cholesterol biosynthesis” . fisher’s exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the ipa-tox pathways was explained by chance alone.

in an attempt to identify unique and common molecules across the gene lists the ipa-compare function was applied. additional file  <dig> shows the associated functions of the top networks as suggested by ipa core analysis in significantly affected transcripts in cod larvae exposed to the different exposure treatments. according to the ipa-tox, the unique molecules in both the cdh and mdh lists encode proteins responding to oxidative stress. “nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response”  topped the list in larvae from the cdh exposure group, while “oxidative stress”  and “nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response”  topped the list in the larvae from the mdh group. these results do not suggest that the two different ways of inducing oil droplets has influenced a major difference in affected pathways in the highest exposure concentration groups. in the medium concentration groups, molecules unique to larvae exposed to chemically induced oil , “lxr/rxr activation”  topped the list, followed by “positive acute phase response proteins”  and “fxr/rxr activation” , while “ppara/rxra activation”  topped the mdm group.

molecules common to the two high-exposure groups, suggests that either way of inducing dispersed oil affected many of the same pathways as indicated by the ipa-tox lists for the separate exposure groups shown in table  <dig>  the five most significant pathways according to the common cdh and mdh molecule list were “negative acute phase response proteins” , “aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling” , “cell cycle: g1/s checkpoint regulation” , “positive acute phase response proteins”  and “cholesterol biosynthesis” . in the medium-exposure groups cdm and mdm, many of the same mechanisms as in the high-exposure groups were induced in the cod larvae, as suggested by the common molecules, with “cytochrome p <dig> panel - substrate is a xenobiotic ”  topping the ipa-tox list, followed by “aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling” . this result clearly shows that components in the dispersed oil have triggered mechanisms known to be induced in animals after exposure to hydrocarbon contaminants.

discussion
the current microarray analysis suggests that chemically dispersed oil has lower transcriptomic effect on larvae of atlantic cod than mechanically dispersed oil, based on the number of significantly affected transcripts and fold changes of a few transcripts. in this work we link the magnitude of transcriptional response to toxicity, especially for well-established biomarkers of mode of action of hydrocarbons such as the cytochrome p <dig> genes, even though we have not examined higher-level toxicity endpoints. increasing knowledge, for example publications included in the comparative toxicogenomic database , suggests this to be a valid assumption for transcriptional responses. earlier studies suggest similar toxicity of chemically and mechanically dispersed oil in invertebrates and fishes  <cit> , or more toxic effects of mechanically dispersed oil than of chemically dispersed oil on copepods and fish  <cit> . clark et al.  <cit>  showed for several organisms that the dispersants themselves did not alter the toxicity of oils, demonstrated by similar lc <dig> values for both chemically and mechanically dispersed crude oil. a similar finding was reported by ramachandran et al.  <cit> , who showed that the dispersant corexit  <dig> did not induce cyp1a in juvenile rainbow trout . epa has evaluated the contribution of dispersants on oil toxicity on shrimps and fish, including corexit 9500a, which was used in the gulf of mexico  <dig> incident, but were not able to see a universal trend  <cit> . by reducing the size of the oil droplets and increasing the aromatic hydrocarbon concentration, one would suspect that the dispersed fraction is more bioavailable to fish for accumulation via the gills and oral uptake  <cit> . however, conflicting evidence exists as to whether dispersed oil is more toxic than crude oil or untreated water-accommodated fraction of oil to fish. for example, van scoy et al.  <cit>  showed that dispersant application significantly decreased hydrocarbon potency in chinook salmon  pre-smolts, whereas many studies suggest that the oil droplet fractions of oil dispersions increase the bioavailability and thereby the mechanism of toxicity of compounds of crude oil in fishes  <cit>  or have only moderate effects on fish  <cit> . with a fold change cut-off of  <dig>  and p< <dig> , mechanically dispersed oil produced a much longer list of significantly affected transcripts than chemically dispersed oil. by comparing the significantly affected transcripts in larvae from the cdh and mdh exposure groups with the control in a pca plot it also appears that mechanically dispersed oil is more toxic than chemically dispersed oil. one possible explanation for this finding is that the dispersant might have changed the characteristics of the oil droplets in a way that i) the dissolution rates of oil components into the water phase is lowered or ii) that the "stickiness" of oil droplet on fish larvae or rotifier  surfaces is reduced. since we obtained relatively comparable treatments in terms of oil concentrations, and the transcriptional effects are more pronounced for the mechanically dispersed oil than for the chemically dispersed oil, it is possible that the properties of the chemical dispersant decreases the exposure of cod larvae to oil components either through reduced dissolution of oil components, by reducing oil droplet fouling of cod larvae and/or reducing the uptake of oil droplets through food.

according to the microarray data, transcripts encoding cytochrome p <dig> system proteins were most strongly affected by the oil dispersions. cyp1a <dig> , the transcripts showing the highest induction, was most severely affected in larvae in the mdh treatment group. this result is in line with numerous previous studies showing that cyp1a is easily induced in fish via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  by components in the oil  <cit> . the induction of fish liver cyp1a has often been used as a molecular biomarker for exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons  <cit> . several components of the crude oil can induce cyp1a, which is largely responsible for metabolism of pahs and a variety of other toxic compounds  <cit> . significantly elevated levels of cyp1a following exposure to the two oil dispersions were also determined by the rt-qpcr analyses. however, the more specific rt-qpcr analyses did not confirm that mechanically dispersed oil was more toxic based on the transcriptional levels of cyp1a, neither in the low, medium or high-concentration exposure larval groups. instead they suggested that cyp1a was about 60-fold up-regulated by both types of oil dispersions. in a recent study in which cod larvae were exposed to dispersed oil or to the water-soluble fraction of oil , we observed a stronger induction of cyp1a in terms of fold change  <cit> . the relative levels of induction were greater following exposure to the dispersed oil, with a 300-fold up-regulation in the high-exposure group, compared to a 237-fold up-regulation in the high-exposure wsf group as suggested with the rt-qpcr data  <cit> . the reason for the lower induction levels of cyp1a transcription observed in the current study is unknown.

interestingly, the three cyp <dig> transcripts quantified with rt-qpcr in the current study showed a different level of induction, with cyp1a <dig>  cyp1b <dig> and cyp1c <dig> being  <dig>   <dig> and 8-fold up-regulated in larvae from the cdh group and  <dig>   <dig>  and 8-fold up-regulated in larvae from the mdh group. based on the microarray sequences used to design our pcr primers, the cyp1a <dig> assay matched equally well against cyp1a <dig> with blastx searches, while the cyp1c <dig> assay matched almost equally against cyp1c <dig>  suggesting that more research are needed into the transcription of the different cyp <dig> genes and organ-specific function of their encoded proteins in cod.

in addition to the cyp <dig> genes, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor  transcript was also up-regulated in cod larvae for the high-exposure groups. the protein encoded by the ahrr transcript participates in the ahr signaling cascade, and is involved in regulation of cell growth and differentiation . ahrr represses the transcription of cyp1a <dig> by binding to the xenobiotic response element  sequence present in the promoter regulatory region of variety of genes. ahrr acts by recruiting ankyrin repeat, family a ,  <dig> , hdac <dig> and/or hdac <dig> to repress cyp1a <dig> in mammals . several transcripts annotated to ankyrin genes were also up-regulated in cod larvae from the high-exposure groups, among them ankyrin repeat and btb domain containing  <dig> . histone deacetylase  <dig>  was significantly down-regulated in larvae from both the cdh and mdh groups, while histone deacetylase  <dig>  was significantly up-regulated in larvae from the mdh exposure group. these results suggest that both cyp1a <dig> and ahrr mrna inducibility is part of a mechanistic basis for resistance of fish larvae against compounds in dispersed oil, explaining the simultaneous induction of cyp1a <dig> and ahrr mrna. a similar finding has been reported for atlantic tomcod , with a positive correlation between ahrr and cyp1a <dig> mrna levels in fish exposed to ah-responsive compounds  <cit> . another explanation for this finding could also be that the dispersed oil mediated different effects in different organs, e.g. strong induction of cyp1a <dig> transcription via ahr activation by aromatic hydrocarbons in liver, and effects via other mechanisms on ahrr transcription in other tissues. organ-specific mechanisms cannot be studied in pooled whole larvae, representing a methodological limitation of using rna from whole fish larvae for microarray examinations.

mechanistic effects of contaminants can be studied with a number of tools. in this study we chose to use gene set enrichment analysis  and pathway analysis with the ingenuity pathways analysis  system. the gsea data suggest that the two oil dispersions partly affected different cellular mechanisms, with several gene sets suggesting an effect on the proteasome complex. as part of the ubiquitin protein degradation system, the ubiquitin-protein ligases target specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and some of these genes potentially have a role in regulation of cell proliferation or differentiation . components in the oil dispersions may therefore affect protein folding, and thereby activating ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of misfolded proteins  <cit> . comparing the two high-exposure groups cdh and mdh, in addition to the mentioned effect on the proteasome complex, the main difference between them seems to be that chemically dispersed oil specifically affected nucleosome assembly and dna methylation by up-regulation of transcripts involved in these mechanisms, while mechanically dispersed oil mediated a down-regulation of the same gene sets. the mechanistic basis for this response is unclear, but this finding suggests that compounds in oil dispersions may affect epigenetic mechanisms in the developing cod larvae. chromatin remodeling and altered dna methyltransferase activity are key components of epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and these effects of dispersed oil should be studied more closely in follow-up investigations.

according to the ipa-tox data, it appears that the oil dispersions have affected many well-known toxicological mechanisms, including aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, acute phase response proteins, oxidative stress, cell proliferation and nuclear receptor mediated responses. all of these represent well-known effects of toxic compounds in crude oil such as pahs. using a broader approach as shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the ipa core analyses suggest that chemically and mechanically dispersed oil share many of the top networks. even when looking at transcripts that were uniquely affected in larvae from the different exposure groups, the data suggest a relatively similar mode of action in both exposure groups. as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  transcripts common for the cdh and mdh groups, suggest that the dispersed oil mainly affected genes involved in dna replication, recombination, and repair.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this work suggests, if a significant altered number of affected genes can be used as a proxy to determine the exposure intensity, that chemically dispersed oil has lower toxic effects on atlantic cod larvae than mechanically dispersed oil. cytochrome p <dig> gene transcripts were most strongly affected in the exposed fish larvae. the main difference in mechanistic response between the two different oil dispersion treatments, was that chemically dispersed oil appears to have a stronger effect on nucleosome assembly and chromatin remodeling than mechanically dispersed oil, whereas the latter have a more pronounced effect on proteasome mediated protein proteolysis. functionally, chemically and mechanically dispersed oil mainly affected similar mechanisms in the cod larvae, suggesting that the dispersant did not contribute strongly to the observed responses.
