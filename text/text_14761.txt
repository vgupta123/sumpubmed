BACKGROUND
seed storage reserves accumulated during embryogenesis in higher plants are crucial for plant propagation, providing carbon and energy during germination prior to seedling establishment. in mature arabidopsis seeds, storage lipids and proteins are the major storage compounds, each accounting for 30% - 45% of the seed dry weight  <cit> . the past decade has witnessed a substantial progress in identification and characterization of genes involved in the de novo fatty acid  biosynthesis and triacylglycerol  assembly pathways . this advancement is particularly evident in the model plant arabidopsis, largely owing to the sequencing and release of its relatively compact genome in the year  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, characterization of transcription factors  has led to the identification of several master regulator genes that play critical regulatory roles in this biological process, including abi <dig> , lec <dig> , lec <dig> and fus <dig>   <cit> . these tfs interact with each other and form complex regulatory networks  <cit> , regulating multiple aspects of seed development including storage reserve accumulation through interaction with cognate cis-acting dna elements in the promoter regions of target genes. abi <dig>  fus <dig> and lec <dig> contain a plant-specific 'b3' dna-binding domain which targets ry-repeat regulatory elements, whereas lec <dig> and l1l  contain a nf-yb domain binding to the ccaat boxes in the promoter region  <cit> . additional tfs such as wrinkled  <dig> , a member of plant-specific apetala  <dig>  - ethylene response element binding factor  family, is also known to control transcription of many fa biosynthetic genes  <cit> , and recent studies show it acts via binding to the aw-box motif present in the promoter region of  <dig> fa biosynthetic genes  <cit> . moreover, abi <dig>  and various basic-leucine zipper  tfs including abi <dig> or eel  are known regulators of the expression of seed storage protein  genes, which act in the same signalling network but downstream of abi <dig>  <cit> . distinct regulatory mechanisms are present in controlling the accumulation processes of oils and proteins, perhaps with cross-talk to coordinate the synthesis of seed storage compounds. this coordination could help to explain the well-documented negative correlation  between oil and protein content in seeds of many oleaginous species . moreover, several tfs, such as lec <dig>  abi <dig> and fus <dig>  have been demonstrated to regulate many genes in the synthesis of both oils and storage proteins in developing seeds  <cit> .

in contrast to the great advancement in characterizing individual genes involved in the accumulation of seed storage reserves, the relationship of their expression and regulation is not well understood. a more holistic view of this biological process at the systems level would prove beneficial in developing strategies to further enhance seed yield and oil content, as well as in the modification of oil composition. to gain insights into global transcriptional dynamics in key cellular processes, microarray is an effective method for analyzing the transcript abundance of a large number of genes simultaneously. datasets obtained from profiling experiments can be further used to infer gene regulatory networks. in arabidopsis, two cdna microarrays were designed several years ago based on the expressed sequence tag  sequences available at the time. one array was used for tissue-specific expression profiling to identify genes that are preferentially expressed in developing seeds compared with vegetative leaves and roots  <cit> , and the other was used to study the temporal pattern of gene expression during the critical period of seed filling  <cit> . these transcriptional profiling studies in arabidopsis seeds have greatly increased our understanding of overall alterations of gene expression during seed development and storage reserve accumulation. these two early cdna-based microarrays, however, surveyed < <dig> unique arabidopsis genes.

more recently, schmid et al.  <cit>  created a global gene expression atlas atgenexpress  representing the arabidopsis life cycle using the arabidopsis ath <dig> genome array , which can measure nearly  <dig>  genes in a single assay. in atgenexpress,  <dig> chips were hybridized for  <dig> different samples collected from various organs, growth stages and under various environmental conditions, including  <dig> arrays for eight stages of maturing seeds. since its release, this exceptionally large transcriptome dataset has been a goldmine for plant biologists to identify candidate genes for molecular characterization. a number of studies have further "mined" this dataset within different contexts of plant biology. wang et al.  <cit>  extracted the expression data for several tfs experimentally determined to regulate seed development and genes that code for enzymes in the fa biosynthesis pathway. volodarsky et al.  <cit>  utilized the dataset to analyze hormone-related transcriptional activities in arabidopsis. vandepoele et al.  <cit>  constructed coexpression networks and predicted cis-regulatory elements for the cell cycle-related tf obp <dig>  recently, the identification of gene coexpression networks has emerged as a popular method for predicting gene functions and interactions  <cit> , and web-based tools such as genevestigator  <cit>  and cressexpress  <cit>  have been developed to facilitate such analyses at a small scale for plant biologists. transcriptional coordination, or coexpression, of genes may be an indication of functional relatedness, based on the "guilt-by-association" principle  <cit> . in a coexpression network, a vertex or node represents a gene whereas an edge is a connection inferred from the correlation coefficient calculated from the gene expression data. although the relationship between coexpression networks and true biological networks is often not clear, it has been shown that gene groups identified from modular  analysis in coexpression networks often exhibit an enrichment of certain gene ontology  categories  <cit> , suggesting the functional association of genes connected in a coexpression network. hence, a coexpression edge can be considered a putative interaction between two genes. genes in a coexpression network, particularly those expressed in a specific tissue or sharing a semantic similarity in the go 'biological process' aspect, might be co-regulated through common tf binding sites in their upstream regions, leading to many attempts to identify overrepresented cis-motifs in coexpressed genes  <cit> .

in the current study, we took advantage of this public transcriptome dataset in arabidopsis  <cit> , analyzed the raw data thoroughly in the context of seed storage reserve accumulation during seed development, and constructed coexpression networks for seed-expressed genes. we focused on genes involved in fa biosynthesis and the accumulation of storage lipids and proteins in developing seeds. this comprehensive analysis has resulted in the identification of a large number of genes that are possibly coexpressed and function cooperatively during seed maturation. furthermore, we predicted a large number of cis-regulatory elements for key seed-expressed genes. this information could be useful in designing experiments to probe regulatory mechanisms underlying seed storage reserve accumulation.

RESULTS
association of seed transcriptome with embryo morphology in developing arabidopsis seeds
using the raw intensity data generated by atgenexpress for a global gene expression atlas throughout the arabidopsis life cycle  <cit> , we performed a detailed analysis of gene expression pertaining to seed storage reserve accumulation during the eight stages of seed development, ranging from globular embryo to mature embryo stages . of the nearly  <dig>  genes represented on the affymetrix genechip ath <dig> genome array, we estimated that approximately  <dig>  genes  were expressed in at least one of the eight development stages. our analysis took into account the fact that certain genes might be transiently expressed at only one stage during seed development. the relatively high log <dig> intensity value of  <dig>  was chosen as the threshold to focus on the genes with at least a modest level of expression. the global transcriptional activity in the developing arabidopsis seed is higher than in the leaf, lower than in the flower, and comparable to that in the apex, root or stem .

the descriptions of samples used for microarray experiments in atgenexpress  <cit>  were obtained from the tair where the raw data files were retrieved  <cit> . the development stages for these seed samples range from four to  <dig> days after pollination, encompassing the accumulation phase of both oils and storage proteins  <cit> .

to examine the overall transcriptome changes across the eight seed development stages, we performed a principal component analysis  in the 'sample' space, and the results indicated that the global transcriptional program changes constantly during seed maturation . in pca, the first principal component  was estimated to explain ~83% of variance in the seed transcriptome, indicating that embryogenesis is the predominant cause for the substantial variation observed in the transcript population. the differences in the global gene expression patterns among the eight developing stages were cross validated by a global association test  <cit> , showing that the seed transcriptome varied across the eight developmental stages in a statistically significant manner . the presence of siliques in the young seeds  may have had an effect on global transcript profiles in the seeds of earlier development stages, but its minor effect cannot be dissected from that of seed development under the experimental design in  <cit> . additionally, figure  <dig> shows that each stage has a distinct transcriptome signature that generally corresponds to its seed development stage defined by the embryo's morphology. for instance, as shown in figure  <dig>  the globular embryo stage  grouped tightly, the two samples from the bilateral stage clustered together but separately from other stages, and in general, samples from the expanded cotyledon stage and the mature embryo stage also clustered corresponding to their morphological stages, respectively. the transcriptome signature for one expanded cotyledon stage , however, was closer to the two samples of the mature cotyledon stage, rather than the expanded cotyledon stage defined by embryo morphology. this result suggests that staging of seed development based on the embryo's morphological shape alone may not necessarily reflect the transcriptome state in the seed, which is attributable to the fact that molecular events, such as gene expression, occur prior to morphological changes. consistent with the highly dynamic landscape in global gene expression, our analysis on individual genes using the method in  <cit>  indicated that nearly all the genes expressed in developing arabidopsis seeds are differentially transcribed under a stringent false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig>  . this lack of stably expressed genes with adequate transcript abundance brings into focus the challenge of determining reference genes that can be used for normalization in quantifying mrnas in developing seeds  <cit> . in summary, this analysis demonstrates that the transcriptional program is subject to constant alterations during seed development as many other studies have shown, suggesting its tight regulation at the transcriptional level.

construction of gene coexpression networks in the arabidopsis seed transcriptome
to infer the gene coexpression network in the transcriptome of developing arabidopsis seeds, we focused on the  <dig>  genes with moderate or high expression levels. the pearson-based correlation coefficient was used as a measure of expression coherence, and we applied a correlation threshold of  <dig>  and retained over  <dig>  million correlated gene pairs representing  <dig>  distinct genes. the resulting coexpression networks encompassed approximately 95% of seed- expressed genes, indicating that the majority of expressed genes in arabidopsis seeds act in a concerted manner. we chose such a stringent correlation threshold considering the relatively small sample size in the analysis so that gene pairs in the coexpression network are statistically significant , meaning the probability of randomly obtaining a correlation coefficient of ≥  <dig>  in this seed transcriptome dataset is small. the frequency distribution of the number of connections is shown in figure  <dig>  nayak et al.  <cit>  used the absolute correlation  to construct a gene coexpression network in human immortalized b cells, but we believe that positive and negative correlations in gene expression may indicate different biological interactions , and therefore we only included gene pairs with positive correlation coefficients above the threshold for the coexpression analysis. nevertheless, gene pairs consistently expressed in a negatively correlated manner can also be of great interest to biologists.

we also used a complementary clustering approach to identify gene clusters with similar expression profiles during seed maturation . we found six clusters could sufficiently represent the distinct patterns inherent in this seed transcriptome dataset, with some clusters being the "mirror images" of others. the first two clusters included the majority of genes related to the accumulation of seed storage reserves, which will be described in more detail below. it is important to point out that the method for identifying coexpression networks is computationally similar to various clustering approaches, using correlation coefficient  as the similarity measure, or alternately  <dig> - |r| as the distance measure. an important difference exists, however, in the parameters used in the two processes: the number of clusters is often specified in clustering although certain assessment can be performed beforehand, whereas the correlation threshold is chosen in the coexpression network analysis. we believe our approach of coexpression network identification, coupled with clustering, is advantageous for identification of genes in the same coexpression cluster with visible expression patterns during seed maturation, enabling easier biological interpretation and various complementary analyses.

several parameters can be used to describe a biological network, including the clustering coefficient and scale-free topoplogy criterion. the scale-free topology criterion ranges from zero to one for typical biological networks under investigation  <cit> . the clustering coefficient and scale-free topology criterion were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in this arabidopsis seed coexpression network , indicating topological similarity to other biological networks. as shown in figure  <dig>  the network is comprised of many genes with few links  but relatively few genes with many connections, which is consistent with the power-law distribution widely present in biological networks. in the coexpression network, each gene has a median of  <dig> edges. it is notable that a relatively large number of genes have ≥ <dig> edges , which is at least partly due to this larger range containing all remaining numbers of connections. we observed the edge numbers for genes in different gene ontology  'biological process' categories and did not find any association between the number of coexpression partners and obvious functional significance ; tf gene lec <dig> and a ribosomal protein s <dig> gene , for instance, were found to connect with  <dig> and  <dig> coexpression partners, respectively. this indicates that, while the number of edges for a node may suggest the functional significance of the gene, the centrality  of a node in the network can be more important. this aspect has been well described in social network analysis  <cit> .

 network properties were analysed according to the methods in  <cit> . a the clustering coefficient measures the "small-world" property in the network, which is the likelihood that two genes connected to a common gene are also connected to each other  <cit> . b the scale-free topology criterion is used to measure the topological similarity of a network to other biological networks. its value ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  with  <dig> representing networks that are most like other biological networks  <cit> . c gamma is the measurement of power-law distribution in a network  <cit> , which consists of many genes with relatively few connections and a few genes  with many connections; a gamma <  <dig> indicates that a network exhibits such a distribution  <cit> .

genes encoding fatty acid biosynthetic genes and seed storage reserve associated proteins are located in different subnetworks
while the entire coexpression network is useful for network topology analysis, isolation of a subnetwork  makes it more accessible to biologists  <cit> . more importantly, a subnetwork in the large coexpression network is often more biologically relevant in a pathway context. hence, we extracted subnetworks from this gene coexpression network for genes relevant to the accumulation of seed storage reserves . of the  <dig> genes known to encode enzymes involved in fa biosynthesis  <cit> , we identified  <dig>  genes represented on the ath <dig> array, and all of them were found in one subnetwork . this subnetwork cluster consists of  <dig> genes , which is in general agreement with an interactive correlation network generated genome-wide in arabidopsis using a heuristic clustering algorithm  <cit> . such a gene list can be used to identify interactors of genes in fa synthesis in developing seeds. consistent with the coexpression subnetwork analysis, the majority of genes involved in fa biosynthesis were associated with cluster  <dig> . their expression levels increased steadily from the globular embryo stage, generally reached the peak at the expanded cotyledon stage, and dramatically declined subsequently throughout late seed maturation . such a unified expression pattern for most fa biosynthetic genes supports earlier studies showing that fa supply can be a limiting factor for triacylglycerol  accumulation in developing embryos of brassica napus  <cit> , olive  and oil palm  <cit> , as well as cuphea lanceolata and other oil species  <cit> . recent studies of metabolic flux in developing embryos of b. napus, however, indicated that tag assembly was more limiting than fa biosynthesis in regulating the flow of carbon into tag  <cit> . the majority of genes encoding oilbody oleosins and ssps were found in another subnetwork with a distinct expression pattern . the subnetwork encompassing genes encoding oleosins and ssps is comprised of  <dig> genes . genes encoding oleosins and ssps were in cluster  <dig> , and their expression profiles were strikingly similar. these genes were virtually unexpressed at the globular stage, increased rapidly  from the globular stage to the bilaternal stage, and remained at the elevated expression level throughout the remaining stages of seed maturation . transcripts for oleosin and ssp genes are most abundant in the seed transcriptome late during seed development. in contrast, most genes in the tag assembly pathway were found in different subnetworks, exhibiting various expression profiles during seed development . diacylglycerol acyltransferase  <dig> , fatty acid desaturase  <dig> , fatty acid elongase  <dig>  and stearoyl desaturase  genes were identified in this subnetwork, albeit expressed at substantially lower levels compared to genes encoding oleosins and ssps . dgat catalyzes the acyl-coa-dependent acylation of sn- <dig> -diacylglycerol to produce tag and coa  <cit> . fad <dig> catalyzes the introduction of a second double bond into acyl groups in phospholipid whereas sad catalyzes the formation of monounsaturated fa in the plastid  <cit> . fae <dig> catalyzes the elongation oleoyl-coa in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . our analysis determined that at1g <dig>  which was named dgat <dig>  is the putative gene encoding a cytosolic dgat in arabidopsis. the amino acid sequence of at1g <dig> has a significantly high degree of similarity  to the soluble dgat in peanut , where the cytosolic dgat gene in plants was first discovered  <cit> . notably, dgat <dig> exhibited a similar expression pattern with dgat <dig>  but expressed higher during late seed maturation. in earlier studies, quantification of dgat activity during seed maturation in b. napus indicated that enzyme activity was maximal during the rapid phase of oil accumulation with a substantial decrease in activity occurring as oil levels reached a plateau  <cit> . assuming dgat activity shows a similar profile during seed development in arabidopsis, this suggests that dgat may be down-regulated post-transcriptionally and/or post-translationally during the latter stages of seed development.

in summary, our new results suggest that genes acting in a biological process  can be indicated by their presence in the same coexpression network cluster, but genes involved in the same pathway  may not necessarily exhibit expression coherence. as a result, computational approaches using coexpression network to predict gene function, such as in  <cit> , will undoubtedly have limitations.

putative regulatory elements underlying seed storage reserve accumulation
to gain insight into possible relationships in gene coexpression and regulation, we first identified the expression patterns for several tfs known to regulate the accumulation of seed storage reserves . agl <dig> , gl <dig> , lec <dig>  l1l, and wri <dig> exhibited similar expression patterns with most genes encoding proteins involved in fa biosynthesis  whereas abi <dig>  eel, and fus <dig> all have similar expression profiles with genes encoding oleosins and ssps . two repressors of seed maturation genes, asil <dig>   <cit>  and pickle   <cit> , were modestly expressed and exhibited a stable expression pattern throughout seed maturation . surprisingly, lec <dig>  a tf gene known to regulate oil accumulation in leaves and somatic embryogenesis  <cit> , was barely detectable in these developing seeds. although this result requires verification with other molecular methods, it was previously reported that lec <dig> might be only expressed during early embryo morphogenesis  <cit> . additionally, based on phenotype descriptions of lec <dig>  lec <dig> mutants in the arabidopsis information resource   <cit> , the accumulation of storage compounds in the mature lec <dig> mutant seeds is only slightly defective when compared to lec <dig> mutant seeds. therefore, the role of lec <dig> as a regulator in the synthesis of seed storage reserves during late stages of zygotic embryo development might not be as important as currently thought. likewise, abi <dig> was also essentially unexpressed in these seed samples. the expression similarity between genes encoding tfs and their target genes is suggestive of regulatory relationships. both lec <dig> and wri <dig> were clustered with most fa biosynthetic genes, while abi <dig> was clustered with the majority of late-embryogenesis abundant  genes . lec <dig> and wri <dig> are known to regulate many fa biosynthetic genes  <cit> , and abi <dig> regulates a subset of leas  <cit> .

to computationally identify cis-acting regulatory elements, the upstream promoter sequences for the genes involved in storage reserve biosynthesis were extracted from the rsat server  <cit> . we included some 5'-utr sequences as certain tf binding sites can be located within this region of a gene  <cit> . on average, the g-c content in the promoter sequences of the gene set was found to be <35%, which is consistent with the compositional bias of nucleotides towards a-t enrichment observed in plant promoter regions  <cit> . two software tools, tfbs  <cit>  and fdrmotif  <cit> , were used to search for putative tf-binding sites on both strands. both tools depend on tf- binding profiles  derived from experimentally determined binding sites for the prediction, we thus compiled  <dig> pwms from the literature  <cit>  and the jaspar database  <cit>  . in the jaspar database, we only considered the binding profiles for plant-specific tfs because of their potential critical roles in regulating the accumulation of storage reserves during seed development, a unique physiological process in higher plants.

we predicted a total of  <dig> binding motifs in the promoter regions of genes involved in fa biosyntheis, tag assembly, and genes encoding oleosins and seed storage proteins . each tf can have more than one putative binding site in each gene. as our approach of using two predictive tools already filtered out a large number of potentially false predictions, the remaining number of putative motifs was relatively small, making it difficult to perform statistical analysis of motif enrichment. therefore, we used a simple approach to determine overrepresentation of a tf binding motif in the gene set, and defined the number of the motifs for a particular tf as overrepresented if it is greater than the sum of the average plus the standard deviation of all predicted motifs in a gene set. sequence logos are used to show the degree of conservation, indicated by the height of each nucleotide, at each position . for the aw-box motif interacting with wri <dig>  which possesses a sequence pattern of  <dig> , we predicted binding sites in  <dig> of  <dig> fa genes identified, seven more than reported recently in  <cit> . the highly conserved ccaat motifs for lec <dig>  binding are significantly enriched in promoters of all fa biosynthetic genes identified. motifs that interact with tf genes known to regulate light-induced genes, such as zinc-finger proteins dof <dig>  and dof <dig>  <cit> , as well as gata tfs and sorlip  <dig>   <cit> , are overrepresented in the promoters of fa biosynthetic genes. dof <dig> , however, was expressed only at the early globular embryo stage. dof <dig>  exhibited a similar expression profile during seed development as for fa biosynthetic genes . arr  genes encode arr <dig> and arr <dig>  which have been shown to regulate the interaction of cytokinin and auxin in root stem-cell specification during early embryogenesis  <cit> . we found no binding matrices for these two regulators, but the binding matrix for arr <dig> is present in our compiled matrix set and arr <dig> motifs are overrepresented in the promoter regions of fa biosynthetic genes. we also found no binding matrices for agl  <dig> or gl2; binding profiles for agl  <dig> and agl  <dig> were present in our analysis but no enriched motifs were identified in the promoter sequences of these fa biosynthetic genes.

refer to additional file  <dig> for each matrix identifier . the abbreviations of transcription factors , promoter element, and pathway names are as follows: wri1: wrinlked 1; dof: dna binding with one finger; sorlip: sequences over-represented in light-induced promoter; cbf: ccaat binding factor; bzip: basic leucine zipper; fa: fatty acid; ssp: seed storage protein.

for the genes and isoforms in the tag assembly pathway, no overrepresented motifs have been found. our goal was to identify putative promoter elements that can be used for experimental studies . interestingly, promoter motifs for b <dig> domain tfs, such as abi <dig>  fus <dig> and lec <dig>  were found to be overrepresented in promoters of genes encoding oleosins and ssps. motifs for bzip factors  also appeared to be overrepresented in the promoter regions of these genes, but there were no binding matrices for bzip abi <dig> or eel.

our approach of computational promoter analysis was limited by the availability of experimentally determined tf-binding sites for deriving binding profiles of additional tfs. we compiled a list of  <dig> binding matrices for this analysis, but if binding profiles for other tfs can be generated from a reasonable number of known binding sites, we could identify more tfs that possibly regulate the accumulation of seed storage reserves. in addition, we only considered upstream sequences of  <dig> bp plus  <dig> bp 5'-utr for each gene, because the majority of cis-acting regulatory elements are located in this region  <cit> . other genomic regions including the 3'-utr, or even introns, however, can also harbour tf binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses indicate that genes involved in the accumulation of seed storage reserves, along with known tf genes, are expressed in distinct patterns during seed maturation. promoter motifs for ccaat binding factors lec <dig> and l1l, dof and gata factors, ap <dig> wri <dig> as well as myb factors are enriched in the promoter regions of genes involved in fa biosynthesis. binding sites for b3-domain factors  and bzip factors are overrepresented in the promoter regions of genes encoding oleosins and seed storage proteins. when binding profiles for additional tfs become available, more putative regulatory elements will be detected, which in turn can be validated for functionality.
