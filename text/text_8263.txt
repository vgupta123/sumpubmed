BACKGROUND
genetic and archaeological findings suggest that pig domestication began about 9000– <dig> years before present  at multiple sites across eurasia, followed by their subsequent spread at a worldwide scale  <cit> . historically, europe and china are two major areas of pig breeding  <cit> . over the past centuries, pigs have shown marked differences between these two areas, even if many european pig breeds carry far eastern haplotypes at high frequencies because of an ancient introgression with chinese swine  <cit> . the chinese pigs differ significantly from european pig breeds such as the large white for many traits including fatness and ear traits  <cit> . genetic variation within the gene pool which produce the above different phenotypes are selected for or against by evolution. microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms  were the main measures of genetic variations in pigs, producing a usmarc pig snp map  and the porcinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip with  <dig> snp probes  <cit> . recently, structural variations including insertions, duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations of dna have been shown to contribute to the major phenotypic variations  <cit> . copy number variation  is described as a segment of dna > <dig> kb that is copy number variable when compared with a reference genome  <cit> . this variation may either be inherited or caused by de novo mutation  <cit> . it has become apparent that cnvs are genome-wide present in the human genome  <cit>  and the genome of farm animals including cattle  <cit> , avian  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , goat  <cit> . about a range from 5% to 16% of the human genome was covered by cnvs  <cit> . cnvs can lead to striking phenotypic consequences as a result of altering gene dosage, disrupting coding sequences, or perturbing long-range gene regulation by position effects  <cit> . these striking phenotypic consequences include some common complex diseases such as autism  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit> , auto-immune addison's disease  <cit> .

recently many efforts have been used to detect pig cnvs. by a custom-made tiling oligonucleotide array,  <dig> cnv regions  across chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were identified in  <dig> unrelated duroc boars  <cit> . comparative genome hybridization  array was also conducted for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig> different pig populations including duroc, large white, meishan, pietrain, hampshire and wild boar  <cit> . by analyzing data from the porcine snp <dig> beadchip,  <dig> cnvrs were identified in  <dig> animals from an iberian × landrace cross   <cit>  and  <dig> cnvrs were identified from three purebred populations  and one duroc × erhualian crossbred population  <cit> . up until now, few studies have confirmed the genome-wide presence of cnvs in pigs using array cgh  with high-density probes. here we reported the use of high-resolution oligonucleotide acgh to identify the cnv regions in  <dig> individual pigs from different pig populations. this analysis provided a high-resolution map of copy number variations in the pig genome with a median probe spacing of  <dig> bp relative to the latest porcine genome assembly .

RESULTS
the overview of cnvr library
array cgh  was carried out using a custom-made array comprising  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes covering the whole pig genome assembly with a median probe spacing of  <dig> bp . cnv was assessed by equating the log <dig> ratio of signal intensity between the reference  and test samples. as we did not perform a self-to-self experiment, a stringent criterion with the mean |log <dig> ratio| >  <dig>  was used to reduce the false positive rate of cnv calling according to the studies of wang et al.  <cit>  and fadista et al.  <cit> . therefore, the segments with at least  <dig> consecutive probes and a mean |log <dig> ratio| of >  <dig>  were merged  <cit> . a cnvr was then called if detected in two or more animals. accordingly, we identified  <dig> cnvrs . the cnvrs ranged in size from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb with a mean of  <dig>  kb and a median of  <dig>  kb, covering  <dig>  mb or  <dig> % of the whole genome . the largest cnv region, cnvr_ <dig> with  <dig>  mb in size on chromosome  <dig>  showed copy gain in the white duroc pig, the pietrain pig,  <dig> landrace × div pigs and loss in the yangxin pig and the large white pig.

using the custom tiling oligonucleotide acgh approach, fadista et al.  <cit>  addressed  <dig> cnvrs on the sus scrofa chromosomes   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the preliminary assembly of pig genome among  <dig> duroc boars. ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> cnvrs using the porcine snp <dig> beadchip data of  <dig> animals from an iberian × landrace cross. wang et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> cnvrs based on the porcine snp <dig> genotyping data of  <dig> pigs. two of the  <dig> cnvrs  detected by fadista et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvrs  detected by ramayo-caldas et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> cnvrs  detected by wang et al.  <cit>  were identical or overlapped with the detected cnvrs in this study . totally  <dig> of the presently detected  <dig> cnvrs  were identical or overlapped with those previously reported pig cnvrs . the main potential reasons for this less well-overlapping result could be the different genetic backgrounds of pig samples, different platforms and various calling algorithms between the present study and other studies.

compared with porcinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip, the detection power of  <dig> k acgh was enhanced by dense marker density, uniform distribution of probes along each chromosome  <cit> . hence, some small cnvrs can be detected by acgh technique, as the minimum cnv lengths were  <dig>  kb in our present study, and  <dig>  kb in the study of fadista et al.  <cit> , whereas the minimum cnv length detected by snp chip were  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively  <cit> .

cnvrs chromosome distribution and status
cnvrs were distributed throughout the genome in a non-random manner , which was coherent with the previous studies on heterogeneous distribution of cnvs in primate genomes  <cit> . chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  10– <dig> and  <dig> had the dense cnvs covering more than  <dig> % of genomic sequences . a conserved synteny between homo sapiens chromosome  <dig>  and ssc <dig> had been proposed . proportional to its length, hsa <dig> was especially rich in primate-specific breakpoint regions which would appear to be highly enriched for both segmental duplications  and cnvs  <cit> .

concerning copy number status,  <dig>  cnvrs were called as gains,  <dig>  were called as losses and the remaining  <dig>  were called as both gains and losses. previously, it has been suggested that deletions are under stronger purifying selection than duplications  <cit> . if so, deletions should be both less frequent and shorter than duplications  <cit> . however, when we compared the length of gains with losses in the cnvrs, loss regions had slightly larger sizes than gain regions with the average length of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb respectively . the possible reason was that the acgh approach might favor the identification of deletions  <cit> . as the samples were collected from  <dig> different populations, the considerable number of cnvrs status displaying in ‘both gains and losses’ might be due to the different genetic origins.

putative population-specific cnvrs and cluster analysis
some putative population-specific cnvrs were detected. for example,  <dig> cnvrs including cnvr_ <dig> were purebred landrace-specific, and cnvr_ <dig> were purebred div-specific. cnvr_ <dig> including kit gene contained amplifications specifically in  <dig> pigs with dominant white color and a pietrain pig with black spots, and cnvr_ <dig> contained gains in pigs without dominant white color such as yangxin, erhualian, tongcheng and pietrain pigs. however, due to the limited samples used in the present study, the putative population-specific cnvrs need future study. and we also found  <dig> de novo cnvrs, of which cnvr_ids  <dig>   <dig> were present in  <dig> landrace × div crossbred pigs but not in their parents, while cnvr_ <dig> were absent in  <dig> landrace × div crossbred pigs but present in their parents.

using the cluster tool, average linkage hierarchical clustering based on the cnv profiles of  <dig> tested pigs was performed. figure  <dig> showed the dendrogram of  <dig> pigs generated by average linkage clustering algorithm of cluster  <dig>  software. basically, the chinese native pigs  clustered together, while the other  <dig> pigs with european haplotypes belonged to another big cluster. therefore, cnvs could be used to investigate pig genetic diversity and evolution.

duplicated sequences colocalize with cnvrs in the pig genome
although the exact interpretation of mechanisms responsible for generating cnvs is still unclear, previous studies have noted a four- to twenty-fold enrichment of cnvs near sds in the other mammalian genomes  <cit> . duplicated sequences are typical segments of dna which range in size from one to hundreds of kb, share a high level of sequence identity  and occur at more than one site within the genome  <cit> . under the same filter criterion, about  <dig> %  of cnv regions directly overlapping with sus scrofa duplicated sequences were identified through blasting the cnvr sequence against the ensembl pig genomic sequences. as our present blast results did not retain a cnvr overlapping with a duplicated sequence by less than  <dig> bp, so the overlaps of cnvs and their targeted duplicated sequences were under reporting. there were  <dig> – <dig> % cnvrs mapped to duplicated sequences in the previous reports  <cit> . the difference may be related to differences in samples. cnvrs overlapping duplicated sequences were significantly different in average size  with the cnvrs that did not overlap duplicated sequences, consistent with previous cnv studies reporting a stronger association between duplicated sequences and long cnvrs  <cit> .

gene contents of pig cnv regions
when cnv signals in two or more animals overlapped on a chromosome, they were considered to be high confidence cnvs  <cit> . presently, the high confidence cnvrs contained transcripts from  <dig> to  <dig>  the largest region  detected in all tested pigs showed an  <dig>  kb gain without overlapping any gene or duplicated sequence . same as the previous report in chicken  <cit> , our results showed the small cnvs resided in none coding sequences, while larger cnv regions spanned more genes . the  <dig> cnvrs encompassed  <dig> unique transcripts which corrsonded  <dig> mouse orthologous genes annotated in ensembl . in order to determine the likely biological effects of the  <dig> mouse orthologous genes, functional annotation analysis was performed with the david tool  <cit> . gene ontology  analysis revealed that cnvr genes belonged to these classes of genes that participated in sensory perception of smell, sensory perception of smell or chemical stimulus, sensory perception, cognition, g-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway, olfactory receptor activity and other basic metabolic processes . kegg pathway analyses indicated that  <dig> genes involved in olfactory transduction  were over-represented in the porcine cnvrs, as previously identified in cattle  <cit> . these cnv genes also included atp-binding cassette, sub-family c , tyrosine-protein kinase kit  and cytochrome p <dig>  as described previously  <cit> . a certain degree of conservation of cnvs across mammals has been observed, which suggests that selective pressure may drive acquisition or retention of specific gene dosage alterations.

to test whether genes unaffected by cnvs exhibited a different selective constraint than the ones affected, we compared the dn/ds ratios for orthologous genes of pigs with those of mouse and human species . compared with mouse, all pig cnvr genes had dn/ds ratios significantly higher than monomorphic genes by wilcoxon rank-sum test, which was the same as the previous results  <cit> . it might indicate a relaxation of purifying selection due to the redundancy fragments generated during the formation process of the variable number of genes  <cit> . however, compared with mouse, the pig cnvr genes with the status of gains had dn/ds ratios lower than monomorphic genes, indicating these genes subjected to stringent purifying selection compared with non-polymorphic genes.

dn: nonsynonymous rate; ds : synonymous rate; p-value compares cnvr genes with monomorphic genes by wilcoxon rank-sum test.

pig cnvrs overlapped with qtl regions
we queried the animal qtl database that held publicly available qtl data on livestock species. retrieving all the porcine qtls  within  <dig> mb of our cnvrs resulted that  <dig> cnvrs overlapped with qtls for several important traits including average daily gain  . however, as the pig qtls are not fully defined, the contribution of these qtl-overlapping cnvrs to complex traits needs further study.

validation of cnvrs by real-time quantitative 
qpcr was performed to validate  <dig> cnvrs  detected by the acgh experiment. thirteen dna samples including the reference used in acgh were used for qpcr analysis. cnvr_ <dig> and cnvr_ <dig> were validated  with the p threshold values  <dig>  as the previous reports  <cit> .

cnvr_ <dig> contained mast/stem cell growth factor receptor gene, also known as kit gene . in pigs, the dominant white color was associated with a splice mutation leading to the skipping of exon  <dig> of kit gene  <cit>  and a duplication of a  <dig> kb fragment encompassing the kit gene  <cit> . the results of the acgh array and qpcr analyses revealed that the copy number varied greatly among the different breeds . coinciding with the previous study  <cit> ,  <dig> pigs with white hair color  and the pietrain pig had kit duplication, but  <dig> chinese native pigs without pure white color did not have. in addition to the important role in proliferation, survival and migration of melanocytes  <cit> , the kit gene also had effects on follicle and oocyte development  <cit> . therefore, it was worthy to further investigate the selection impact of white hair color on pig reproduction traits.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we described a map of porcine cnvs between breeds by a high-resolution array cgh, which was confirmed to be a very valid method to detect porcine genome-wide cnvs. with a stringent cnv calling criterion,  <dig> highly reliable cnv regions were reported here among diverse pig breeds. future studies are required to assess the function of cnvs on pig important phenotypes. our results facilitated the identification of structural variations for important phenotypes and the assessment of the genetic diversity in pigs.
