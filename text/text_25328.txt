BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a commensal that colonizes the moist squamous epithelium of the human anterior nares. twenty percent of the population are permanently colonised while the remainder are colonized intermittently  <cit> . it is an important opportunistic pathogen that can cause superficial skin infections as well as invasive life-threatening conditions such as septic arthritis and endocarditis  <cit> . the success of s. aureus as a pathogen can in part be attributed to the expression of cell surface protein receptors designated mscramms  that interact specifically with proteins present in the host plasma and extracellular matrix  <cit> . mscramms act as virulence factors that allow s. aureus to adhere to the surface of host cells and to damaged tissue and help it to avoid phagocytosis by neutrophils  <cit> 

the fibronectin binding proteins  a and b of s. aureus are multifunctional mscramms which recognise fibronectin, fibrinogen and elastin  <cit> . fnbpa and fnbpb have considerable organization and sequence similarity and are composed of a number of distinct domains  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the domain organization of fnbpa and fnbpb of s. aureus strain 8325- <dig>  both proteins contain a secretory signal sequence at the n-terminus and a c-terminal lpetg motif required for sortase-mediated anchoring of the proteins to the cell wall peptidoglycan. the n-terminal a domains of fnbpa and fnbpb are exposed on the cell surface and promote binding to fibrinogen and elastin  <cit> . based on their sequence similarity to the fibrinogen binding a domain of clumping factor a   <cit> , the a domains of fnbpa and fnbpb are predicted to fold into three sub-domains n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> similar to clfa  <cit> . the a domains of fnbpa, fnbpb and clfa bind fibrinogen at the c-terminus of the γ-chain  <cit> . unlike clfa, the a domains of fnbpa and fnbpb also bind to elastin  <cit> . it is proposed that ligand binding occurs through the same dynamic "dock, lock, latch" mechanism that has been predicted for fibrinogen binding to the a domain of clfa  <cit> . the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide binds to a groove located between domains n <dig> and n <dig> in the apo form. c-terminal residues in domain n <dig> undergo a conformational change to bind adjacent to a β-strand in domain n <dig> forming an extra β-strand termed the latching peptide. this traps the fibrinogen peptide in the groove between n <dig> and n <dig> and locks it in place  <cit> .

located distal to the a domains of fnbpa and fnbpb are unfolded regions which contain multiple, tandemly arranged motifs  that bind to the n-terminal type i modules of fibronectin by a tandem beta-zipper mechanism  <cit> . the sequences of the fibronectin-binding motifs are highly conserved in fnbpa and fnbpb from strain 8325- <dig> . by contrast the sequences of the fibrinogen and elastin binding a domains are more divergent .

most research on fibronectin-binding proteins has been preformed with fnbpa from strain 8325- <dig>  it was reported previously that the a domain of fnbpa of s. aureus strain 8325- <dig> comprising residues 37- <dig> bound to immobilized elastin and to fibrinogen   <cit> . the a domain co-ordinates were revised recently and it was noted that the c- terminus of rfnbpa37- <dig> likely contained a single fibronectin-binding motif  <cit> . the ability of this protein to bind fibronectin was later confirmed  <cit> . in the same study, the revised a domain of fnbpa spanning residues 194- <dig>  was shown bind fibrinogen and elastin but not fibronectin. the minimum region of the fnbpa a domain needed for binding to fibrinogen and elastin is subdomains n <dig> . the n <dig> sub-domain is not required for ligand binding  <cit> .

the binding of fnbps to fibronectin promotes the internalization of s. aureus into epithelial and endothelial cells which are not normally phagocytic  <cit> . fnbp-mediated invasion occurs through the formation of a fibronectin bridge between s. aureus and the α5β <dig> integrin  <cit> . this may promote bacterial dissemination from the bloodstream to internal organs and evasion of immune responses and antibiotics. this was convincingly demonstrated in a study of the role of fnbpa in experimental endocarditis where binding to both fibrinogen and fibronectin required. binding of fibrinogen was required for initial colonization of thrombi on damaged valves and while binding to fibronectin was required for the infection to spread  <cit> .

fnbpa and fnbpb are encoded by two closely linked but separately transcribed genes, fnba and fnbb  <cit> . while most strains contain both genes, some strains contain only fnba  <cit> . in strain 8325- <dig>  studies with site-specific fnba and fnbb insertion mutants showed that either fnbpa or fnbpb mediated adherence to immobilized fibronectin but there was no significant difference in adherence between wild type strains and single fnb mutants  <cit> . however, studies with clinical isolates suggested that strain associated with invasive diseases are significantly more likely to have two fnb genes  <cit> .

seven variants  of fnbpa were identified based on divergence in the amino acid sequences of the minimal ligand-binding n <dig> sub-domains  <cit> . each fnbpa isotype retained ligand-binding activity but were antigenically distinct. modelling the 3d structures showed that the amino acid variation occurred in surface-exposed residues and not in those involved in ligand-binding  <cit> .

the initial aim of this study was to characterize the a domain of fnbpb and to determine the extent of variation in the a domain. it was discovered that the a domain of all fnbpb isotypes had the ability to bind to fibronectin by a novel mechanism.

RESULTS
fnbb gene variation in s. aureus whole-genome sequences
previously we reported that the a domain of fnbpa from strain p <dig> varied substantially from that of strain 8325- <dig>  sharing only  <dig> % amino acid identity  <cit> . we then identified seven variants of fnbpa a domain  based on divergence in the minimal ligand-binding n <dig> sub-domain. each recombinant n <dig> variant was shown to retain ligand-binding function but was antigenically distinct  <cit> . this prompted us to investigate variation in the a domain of the second fibronectin-binding protein, fnbpb.

dna encoding the entire fnbpb a domain of strain p <dig> was amplified by pcr and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence was compared with that of strain 8325- <dig> and the overall identity was 80%. the a domain sequences of fnbpb from published s. aureus genomes were compared to determine if diversity in this domain is common amongst s. aureus isolates. all of the sequenced strains, except strain mrsa <dig> and the bovine strain rf <dig>  contain genes encoding both fnbpa and fnbpb. strains mrsa <dig> and rf <dig> both encode the fnbpa protein. the amino acid sequence of the a domain of fnbpb from s. aureus strains 8325- <dig>  col, usa <dig>  mu <dig>  mssa <dig>  n <dig>  mw <dig> and p <dig> were compared by pair-wise alignments and the identities calculated. strains that are closely related and belonging to the same clonal complex were found to share identical a domains. however, comparison of a domain sequences of strains from different sequence types revealed that significant diversity exists. while subdomain n <dig> is highly conserved in all strains  the n <dig> and n <dig> domains from unrelated isolates are significantly more divergent. based on the sequences of the n <dig> subdomains, four variants of fnbpb  were identified that share  <dig>  -  <dig> % amino acid identity .

* pairwise alignments were performed using the amino acid sequences of the n <dig> sub-domains of the fnbpb a domain.

dna hybridization analysis using fnbb isotype-specific probes
to determine the distribution of fnbpb a domain isotypes i - iv in s. aureus strains of different mlsts and to identify any novel a domain isotypes, dna hybridization was used with isotype-specific probes homologous to dna specifying a portion of the highly divergent n <dig> sub-domain. dna encoding the entire a domain was amplified with a domain flanking primers. pcr products were then spotted onto membranes and hybridized with the dig-labelled type-specific probes. an example of the hybridization experiments with probes i - iv is shown in figure  <dig>  the probes were shown to be type-specific because each only hybridized to the appropriate control fnbb fragment . fnbb dna from s. aureus strains  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  did not hybridise to any of the probes, indicating that they may specify novel fnbpb isotypes or lack the fnbb gene.

identification of novel fnbpb isotypes 
the fnbb gene fragments amplified from s. aureus strains  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  did not hybridise to probes specific for fnbpb isotypes i-iv. the fnbb gene fragments from these strains were cloned and sequenced, and the deduced a domain amino acid sequences were compared to the sequences of a domains of types i - iv. s. aureus strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  specify a novel fnbpb a domain called isotype v . the a domains of strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  are also different and are called isotype vi  and isotype vii  . strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> specify an identical a domain which is 92% identical to isotype ii and is called isotype ii* 

phylogenetic analysis of fnbpb a domain isotypes i-vii
it has been recently reported that strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  specify an identical fnbpa a domain called isotype ii  <cit> . in this study, these strains were found to specify different fnbpb a domains, isotypes ii and vi respectively. this indicates that the phylogeny of fnbb alleles does not match that of fnba alleles despite the two genes being closely linked.

fnbp isotypes encoded by bovine s. aureus strains
we expanded the investigation into fnbp variation to include fnbps from a variety of bovine s. aureus strains. nineteen bovine isolates representing genetically unrelated strains were screened to determine if they specified the same fnbp isotypes as human strains. this strain collection included strain rf <dig>  the genome of which has been sequenced  <cit> . rf <dig> contains only one fnb gene encoding fnbpa.

dna encoding fnba was amplified from the genomic dna of each strain using generic a domain primers. pcr products hybridised to fnbpa probes specific for isotypes i, ii, iii or iv. similarly fnbb dna was amplified by pcr from the genomic dna of all strains except rf <dig>  these pcr products hybridised to fnbpb probes specific for isotype i, ii, iii, iv or v. these results indicate that the fnbp isotypes which are expressed by human strains are also specified by bovine strains. furthermore, the results of this study suggest that the lack of fnbb in the genome of strain rf <dig> is not characteristic of all bovine strains. none of the strains tested specify fnbpa or fnbpb isotypes v, vi or vii.

generation of 3d-models for fnbpb  types i-vii and mapping the location of variant amino acid residues
theoretical models of the structure of region a  of fnbpb isotypes i-vii were generated based on the crystal structure of the equivalent domains of the s. aureus clumping factor clfa. a ligand-binding trench is predicted to form between the n <dig> and n <dig> domains of fnbpb. c-terminal residues in sub-domain n <dig> are predicted to form the putative latching peptide. in each of the seven molecular models, the variant residues mapped to the surface of the protein while the residues within the predicted ligand-binding trench are highly conserved . the predicted 3d structure obtained for fnbpb type i of strain 8325- <dig> and the predicted location of variant residues is shown in figure  <dig>  residues 467- <dig> of fnbpb isotype i comprise the predicted latching peptide and are shown here in blue. in the crystal structure of the apo form of clfa the latching peptide is folded over the n <dig> subdomain.

antigenic variation: binding of antibodies to isotypes i-vii
we previously demonstrated that variation in the a domain of fnbpa resulted in proteins that are antigenically distinct. here the ability of polyclonal anti-isotype i antibodies and a monoclonal anti-isotype i antibody to bind different recombinant fnbpb n <dig> isotypes was measured by elisa. polyclonal rabbit anti-isotype i antibodies had a  <dig> -  <dig> fold lower affinity at half maximum binding for isotypes ii - vii compared to isotype i . this suggests that amino acid variation creates differences in surface-exposed epitopes on the a domain molecule that affect immuno-crossreactivity. mouse monoclonal antibody 2e <dig> bound efficiently to isotype i but showed little binding to isotypes ii - vii as shown in figure  <dig>  this suggests that the 2e <dig> epitope is only present on isotype i.

binding of fnbpb a domains isotypes i - vii to immobilized ligands 
each recombinant n <dig> isotype bound to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin in a dose-dependent and saturable manner as shown in figure  <dig>  the estimated half maximum binding concentrations were  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm respectively. these results confirm that the revised co-ordinates of the n <dig> subdomain of region a of fnbpb  is sufficient for ligand-binding and that subdomain n <dig> is not required.

somewhat surprisingly, the seven n <dig> isotypes also bound fibronectin dose-dependently and saturably with a half-maximum binding concentration of  <dig>  μm . recombinant fnbpa isotype i, which was previously shown not to bind fibronectin, was a used was as a negative control. the ability of the fnbpb a domain proteins to bind fibronectin was surprising because the amino acid sequences do not contain any known fibronectin-binding motifs.

measuring the affinity of fnbpb a domain isotype i for fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin by surface plasmon resonance
the results of the solid-phase binding assays suggested that the a domain of fnbpb binds fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin with similar affinity. estimated half maximal binding concentrations were in the low micromolar range. to verify these results, the affinities of rn <dig> isotype i for fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin were measured using surface plasmon resonance. human fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin were immobilized onto the surface of dextran chips. rn <dig> type i protein was passed over the surface in concentrations ranging from  <dig>  μm to  <dig> μm. the representative sensorgrams shown in figure  <dig> have been corrected for the response obtained when recombinant protein was flowed over uncoated chips. the kd for the interaction with fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin was  <dig> μm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively.

discussion
the colonization of host tissue by s. aureus is an important factor in disease pathogenesis. s. aureus expresses on its cell surface a number of mscramms that promote colonization of diverse sites and contribute to virulence. most s. aureus strains can express two distinct fibronectin-binding proteins . these two multifunctional mscramms both mediate adhesion to fibrinogen, elastin and fibronectin.

fnbpa and fnbpb are encoded by the two closely linked genes, fnba and fnbb  <cit> . it has been reported that the fnba and fnbb genes from  <dig> different strains representing the major mrsa clones found in europe have undergone greater sequence divergence than genes encoding other surface proteins such as clfa and clfb  <cit> . analysis of the fnb genes from published genome sequences showed that divergence was confined to the region encoding the n-terminal fibrinogen and elastin-binding a domains while the c-terminal fibronectin-binding motifs were highly conserved . our previous study identified seven isotypes of fnbpa based on divergence in the minimal ligand-binding n <dig> sub-domain  <cit> . each recombinant isotype was found to retain ligand-binding function but was antigenically distinct.

this study aimed to investigate the divergence in the a domain of fnbpb and to determine if variation in this region of the protein is widespread amongst s. aureus strains. the fnbb gene sequences from sequenced s. aureus strains and strain p <dig> were compared. four fnbpb variants  were identified based on divergence in n <dig> sub-domains, which are 66-76% identical to one another.

in order to determine the distribution of fnbpb isotypes i-iv and to identify novel isotypes, type specific probes were generated and used to screen fnbb dna from a variety of clonal types using a well-characterized strain collection of human origin and human isolates where genomes have been fully sequenced  <cit> . three novel fnbpb isotypes were identified  which are  <dig> % - 85% identical to isotypes i-iv. phylogenetic analysis of fnbpb isotypes indicated that the phylogeny of fnbb alleles does not correlate with the core genome as reflected by mlst. the evolution of s. aureus has been predominantly clonal where alleles are 5- to 10-fold more likely to diversify by point mutations than by recombination  <cit> . the distribution of fnbb alleles amongst different s. aureus lineages suggests, however, that recombination has been involved. horizontal transfer by homologous recombination is likely to be responsible for the dispersal of genes encoding the same isotypes across strains of different phylogenies. the distribution of fnba alleles described in the study by loughman et al does not match the distribution of fnbb alleles described here  <cit> . different combinations of fnbpa and fnbpb isotypes are specified by strains that cluster phylogenetically. for example, strains belonging to st <dig> were shown to specify fnbpb type v and fnbpa type v. by contrast, strains belonging to st <dig> specified fnbpb type iv and fnbpa type v. this suggests that the phylogeny of fnbb alleles has evolved independently from that of fnba alleles and has involved separate recombination events despite the genes being closely linked.

our study of fnbp variation in s. aureus was extended here to include bovine s. aureus strains. the genome of the bovine strain rf <dig> contains only the fnba gene but lacks fnbb. using generic primers, dna encoding fnbpa and fnbpb was amplified from genomic dna of nineteen bovine s. aureus strains. the amplification of fnbb dna from these strains indicates that the lack of the fnbb gene in strain rf <dig> is not common to all bovine s. aureus strains. the fnba and fnbb pcr products were subsequently probed with dna probes specific for a domain isotypes specified by human s. aureus strains. it was shown that bovine isolates specify the some of the same isotypes of fnbpa and fnbpb as those specified by human isolates. the distribution of isotypes across the population of bovine strains tested was found to be uneven. no strains tested specified fnbpa isotypes v, vi or vii or fnbpb isotypes vi or vii. the majority of the strains tested were found to specify fnbpa type iv and fnbpb type ii. interestingly in the study of loughman et al, fnbpa type ii was found to be predominant in human clinical isolates  <cit> . it could be postulated that this difference in fnbpa isotype frequency reflects the differences in selective pressures posed by these two distinct host immune systems.

further evidence for the role of recombination in the evolution of s.aureus comes from the genome structure of st <dig> strains which are composed of  <dig> kb of st <dig> dna spliced into  <dig>  kb of an st <dig> strain  <cit> . also, the gene for coagulase has undergone similar diversification as the fnb genes  <cit> . recombination within coa genes encodeding ten major isotypes has created novel subtypes and there is evidence for the same coa isotype being expressed by strains with different genetic backgrounds suggesting horizontal dissemination by homologous recombination  <cit> .

a 3d molecular model of the n <dig> and n <dig> domains of fnbpb was generated based on the known structure of clfa. like the a domain of clfa  it is predicted that the n <dig> subdomain of fnbpb represents the minimal ligand binding region and a ligand binding trench is predicted to form between the n <dig> and n <dig> subdomains. based on this model, it was shown that the majority of variant residues are located on the surface of the protein while residues that are predicted to be involved in ligand-binding are highly conserved. amino acid sequence variation affected antibody recognition. polyclonal antibodies against isotype i had reduced affinity for isotypes ii - vii while a monoclonal antibody raised against isotype i had little or no affinity for all other isotypes. as with fnbpa isotypes, fnbpb sequence variation has created different epitopes on the a domains that affect immunocross-reactivity. this result is consistent with the predicted location of variant residues on the surface of the protein and not in regions involved in ligand binding.

while most strains contain both genes, some strains contain only fnba  <cit> . studies with site-specific fnba and fnbb insertion mutants of strain 8325- <dig> have shown that either fnbpa or fnbpb can mediate adherence to immobilized fibronectin, but there was no difference in adherence between wild type strains and single fnb mutants, indicating functional redundancy  <cit> . however, isolates associated with invasive diseases are significantly more likely to have two fnb genes  <cit> . combined antigenic variation in both fnbpa and fnbpb may be employed by s. aureus to thwart the host immune responses during colonization or invasive infection. interestingly, the diversity which occurs in the n <dig> and n <dig> subdomains of fnbpa and fnbpb does not occur in the n <dig> subdomain of either protein. for both fnbp proteins, the n <dig> subdomain is not required for ligand binding, similar to clfa  <cit> . the a domain of both clfa and another s. aureus fibrinogen binding protein, clumping factor b , are susceptible to cleavage by aureolysin at a slava/slaava motif located between subdomains n <dig> and n <dig>  <cit> . a slava-like motif occurs in both fnbp proteins with s177adva <dig> and s144tdvta <dig> present in fnbpa isotype i and fnbpb isotype i, respectively, which may render the a domains similarly susceptible to proteolysis. perhaps the highly conserved n <dig> subdomains are less readily recognized by the host immune system and may function to protect the ligand-binding n2n <dig> during early stages of infection.

the ligand binding ability of recombinant fnbpb n <dig> subdomain isotypes i-vii was compared by elisa-based solid phase binding assays. each a domain isotype bound to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin with similar affinities. these results confirm that like the a domains of clfa and fnbpa, the n <dig> subdomain of fnbpb is sufficient for ligand-binding and that the n <dig> subdomain is not required for ligand-binding. the results also suggest that these ligand-binding functions are biologically important and are consistent with the predicted location of variant residues on the surface of the protein and not in regions predicted to be involved in ligand binding. using the recombinant n <dig> isotype i protein as a prototype, the affinity of fnbpb for fibrinogen and elastin was analysed by spr. the kd for both interactions was in the low micro molar range.

somewhat surprisingly, the seven recombinant n <dig> fnbpb isotypes examined in this study bound immobilized fibronectin with similar affinity. the interaction between rn <dig> type i  was verified by spr analysis with a kd in the low micro molar range. the results of these fibronectin-binding assays are surprising because this region of fnbpb does not contain any known fibronectin-binding motifs suggesting that the a domains of fnbpb  contain a novel fibronectin-binding motif and may bind fibronectin by a novel mechanism. experiments are currently underway to examine the biological significance of fibronectin-binding by the a domain of fnbpb and to determine a mechanism for this interaction and identify the fnbpb binding region in human fibronectin.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified seven isotypes of the n terminal a domain of fnbpb in a genetically diverse collection of human s. sureus strains. amino acid variation creates differences in immuno-crossreactivity while ligand-binding functions are maintained. this may contribute to immune evasion by s. aureus. the distribution of fnbpb isotypes throughout the s. aureus population is random but does not correlate with the random distribution of fnbpa isotypes described previously. this suggests that fnba and fnbb alleles have been dispersed independently by horizontal transfer which most likely involved homologous recombination. four of the seven fnbpb isotypes were also identified in bovine s. aureus strains. the lack of fnbb in strain rf <dig> is not common to all bovine strains. all seven recombinant a domain isotypes bound fibronectin with a kd in the low micro molar range. this raises the possibility that the a domain of fnbpb binds fibronectin by a novel mechanism. these data have implications for the fnbpb a domain as a target for a vaccine or immunotherapeutics.
