BACKGROUND
one of the main emerging challenges for genomics research is to discover all functional regions in the human genome. the completion of human genome sequencing/assembly and its annotation using computational and comparative genomic approaches has led to the cataloging of ~ <dig>  protein-coding genes. key questions now relate to understanding how the spatial and temporal expression patterns of these human genes are established at cellular and organismal level  <cit> . in eukaryotes, transcriptional regulation tends to involve combinatorial interactions between several transcription factors, which allow for a sophisticated response to multiple conditions in the cellular environment  <cit> . in metazoans the precise spatial and temporal patterns of gene’s expression also require enhancer elements, distant regions of dna that can loop back to the promoter  <cit> . to comprehend the molecular mechanism that governs specific expression patterns, it is important to identify the distant acting transcriptional regulatory elements  associated with each predicted gene  <cit> . furthermore, the ability to identify such elements is an essential step toward understanding how gene expression is altered in pathological conditions  <cit> . however, this task remains difficult due to lack of knowledge of the vocabulary controlling gene regulation and the vast genomic search space, with many of such distantly acting enhancers are positioned remotely from their target gene bodies  <cit> .

metazoan genes hold extremely intricate regulatory sequences that direct complex patterns of expression in diverse cell types, tissues and development phases  <cit> . expression of a typical animal gene is likely to be governed by several distinct enhancer elements that can be located in 5′ and 3′ genomic regions, as well as within intronic intervals  <cit> . metazoan cis-regulatory sequences are modular with each enhancer is responsible for a subset of the total gene expression pattern and usually mediate expression within a specific tissue/cell type or developmental phase/domain  <cit> . these elements are typically up to 500 bp long and contains binding sites for sequence-specific several distinct transcription factors  <cit> .

the origin of organismal complexity is often thought to be the consequence of evolution of novel gene functions subsequent to gene duplication events  <cit> . according to the classical model  one copy of the duplicated gene pair often degenerates by accumulating deleterious mutations, whereas the other copy keeps the ancestral function. this model further predicts that very rarely, one gene copy may obtain a novel adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both duplicates, one copy with the new function and the other preserving the ancestral function. however, in numerous cases, empirical data suggest that the fraction of genes preserved subsequent to duplication events is much higher than predicted by the classic model. keeping in view the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, it was proposed that complementary degenerative mutations in distinct regulatory elements of duplicated genes can assist the preservation of both copies, thus providing long-term opportunities for the evolution of novel gene functions  <cit> . numerous duplicate genes have been confirmed to evolve following this model of regulatory subfunctionalization. for instance, zebrafish engrailed- <dig> and engrailed-1b is a pair of transcription factor genes generated by a duplication event specifically in the lineage of teleost fish  <cit> . expression pattern analysis revealed distinct expression domains for zebrafish engrailed paralogs with engrailed- <dig> is expressed in the pectoral appendage bud, whereas engrailed-1b is expressed in the hindbrain/spinal cord region  <cit> . the mouse genome harbor single ortholog  for both genes of the zebrafish, which is expressed in both pectoral appendage bud and hindbrain/spinal cord. complementary changes in gene expression domains after gene duplication events appear to be a general rule rather than exception and such changes usually happen rapidly after gene duplication  <cit> .

genomic comparison of diverse set of vertebrate species revealed many genomic intervals that have remained conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage  <cit> . some of these sequences correspond to coding genes and non-coding rnas, however two third of them are unlikely to produce a functional transcript  <cit> . these sequences fall in the new category of elements, which we collectively call as conserved non-coding elements   <cit> . these elements are experimentally characterized to harbor transcriptional regulatory elements, so involved in gene expression regulation  <cit> . therefore, comparative genomics based strategies are now being employed to predict genomic regions harboring transcriptional regulatory elements even in the absence of knowledge about the specific characteristics of individual cis-regulatory element  <cit> .

to explore the functional significance of conserved non-coding genomic elements, pennacchio and coworkers  carried out in vivo enhancer analysis of hundreds of human cnes in transgenic mice assay by using lacz as a reporter gene  <cit> . this data confirmed the gene regulatory function for ~ <dig> of these sequences, directing reproducibly the reporter expression in diverse set of body tissues at mouse embryonic day  <dig>   <cit> . to elucidate the significance of this in vivo characterized catalog of human enhancers in organismal development, physiology and medicine it is essential to pinpoint the precise target gene for each of these elements. noteworthy, pennacchio and coworkers  associated the gene regulatory potential of these human enhancers with the genes harboring them  or their immediate flanking genes   <cit> . however, the empirical evidence showed that enhancers regions are often located at large distances from transcriptional start site of the genes upon which they act  <cit> . they may be located upstream or downstream of target gene, within introns, in introns of unrelated neighboring genes or can be found at a distance of 1 mb or even greater and are still able to regulate the gene expression in tissue specific manner  <cit> . scattering of enhancer elements over larger regions in vertebrate genomes, impede attempts to assign precise target gene bodies to functionally characterized enhancer elements.

in the present study, through combined application of comparative synteny analyses and reported endogenous expression pattern investigation we systematically hunt for the precise target gene bodies of experimentally verified catalog of human gene enhancers  <cit> . we concentrate on deeply conserved human enhancers; by restricting to 192/ <dig> cis-regulatory regions that show sequence conservation between mammals and teleost fish  . by assuming that syntenic relationship between an enhancer and concerned target gene remains preserved subsequent to speciation  and duplication events   <cit> , we associated explicitly 85/ <dig> enhancers to single target gene body . in those cases where more than one gene maintained conserve linkage  with single enhancer the pattern of reporter expression induced by an enhancer was compared manually  with the reported endogenous expression pattern of syntenically conserved genes to establish the enhancer-gene relationship. this strategy assisted further in assigning the activity of 57/ <dig> enhancers to single gene, 43/ <dig> enhancers to  <dig> target genes and 7/ <dig> enhancers to  <dig> target genes .

RESULTS
predicting target genes for human cne-enhancers
we devised a rule-based procedure to associate cne-enhancers with their respective target gene . the human cne-enhancers opted for this purpose is conserved over longer evolutionary distance, i.e. between human and teleost fish. pennachio and coworkers has confirmed the gene regulatory potential of these deeply conserved human elements by employing transgenic mice assay  <cit> . combined employment of comparative genomics and expression pattern analysis has assisted us to explicitly assign these human enhancers to their target gene bodies.

teleost fish are preferred for syntenic comparison because synteny comparison of human with closely related vertebrate species  often exhibits the conservation of large number of genes in the vicinity of the cne-enhancer that reflects the short evolutionary distance and slow rate of neutral divergence among mammals, making it difficult to pinpoint the target gene body of functionally defined human enhancer elements. for instance, comparative analysis of an enhancer region  residing on homo sapiens autosome  <dig>  revealed its conserved syntenic association with paralogous genes sp <dig> and sp <dig> in mouse, chicken and frog . furthermore, reported endogenous expression pattern  of both sp <dig>  and sp <dig>  exhibits harmony with the cne-enhancer induced lacz expression in transgenic mice assay . thus, tetrapod specific synteny comparison and endogenous expression pattern inspection of bracketing genes fails to assign the precise target gene body. to solve the puzzle, orthologous teleost fish loci were included in the synteny comparison . careful inspection of genes in the neighborhood of fish cne_sp8-sp <dig> revealed that only sp <dig> gene maintains the syntenic association with this enhancer in zebrafish, medaka, stickleback and tetraodon . it therefore appears that sp <dig> gene is an evolutionary conserved target of human cne_sp8-sp <dig> . by using this systematic methodology we pinpointed specific target genes for the total of  <dig> human cne-enhancer elements .

gene duplication is thought to be a major driving force in evolutionary innovation by providing raw material from which novel gene functions and expression patterns may arise  <cit> . estimation of duplication pattern of selected set of human cne-enhancers  revealed that 17/ <dig>  cne-enhancers have duplicated copies in both teleost fish and tetrapod representatives. 20/ <dig>  have duplicated copies only in teleost fish representatives whereas 6/ <dig>  cne-enhancers have duplicated copies only in human/tetrapods . duplicated cnes enable us to unambiguously associate the total of 42/ <dig> human enhancers to their respective target gene only on the basis of synteny comparison , because a gene undergoes duplication with all of its cis-regulatory elements making genomic regulatory blocks  which also harbor some bystander genes which get depleted from grbs over evolutionary time . thus only duplicated enhancers retain with paralogous copies of their target genes . for instance, in a blast search of a cne-enhancer  residing on hsa <dig>  significant hits were found on two other human chromosomal locations, i.e. hsa <dig> and hsa <dig>  while comparing the human paralogous loci architecture, 2 mb on each side of the cne, triplicate cne copies were found to exhibit syntenic association with three paralogous genes of ebf family, i.e. ebf <dig> , ebf <dig> , and ebf <dig>  . resuming the analysis we searched out orthologous counterparts of these human triplicated cne-enhancers in teleost fish genome . intriguingly, like human genome this enhancer element was found to occur in multiple copies in each of the teleost genome analyzed: four copies in zebrafish, three copies in fugu/stickleback and two copies in medaka . careful inspection of genic contents around paralogous copies of fish cnes revealed that like human genome only ebf family members maintain physical linkage with each copy of this enhancer in teleost fish. differential loss of bystander genes like mgmt, il <dig> and rnf from the enhancer containing orthologous and paralogous loci explicitly leads to the conclusion that this human cne-enhancer  is controlling the spatio-temporal expression of human ebf family members .

among the unduplicated set of cne-enhancers   <dig> regions were assigned to a single target gene only on the basis of synteny comparison . for example, blast based search of a cne-enhancer  residing on hsa <dig>  identified putative orthologs of this human interval in zebrafish, medaka, fugu, stickleback and tetraodon genomes . synteny comparison of human, zebrafish, medaka, fugu, stickleback and tetraodon orthologous loci revealed the differential loss of bnc <dig>  c9orf <dig> and foxe <dig> genes  from the corresponding loci suggesting them as bystanders. sh3gl <dig> was the only gene in this human locus which maintains physical linkage with the cne-enhancer in all examined genomes. therefore, the gene regulatory potential of this cne-enhancer  was assigned to human sh3gl <dig> gene .

very often the situation arose when syntenic comparison alone was not sufficient to pinpoint single target because more than one gene were showing conserved syntenic association with the cne-enhancer element in all evaluated genomes . in this situation, reporter expression pattern induced by cne-enhancer was compared manually  with the reported endogenous expression pattern of candidate neighboring genes. analogy in the expression pattern of cne-enhancer and one of the many conserved genes solved the puzzle . this strategy enabled us to assign a single target gene to 56/ <dig> unduplicated cne-enhancers . for instance, during the syntenic comparison of the orthologous loci of human cne-enhancer  on hsa <dig> , two genes tshz <dig> and znf <dig> are considered as putative target genes because both of them showed conserved syntenic association with the cne-enhancer . however, when expression pattern of tshz <dig> and znf <dig> was monitored only znf <dig> showed harmony in expression with the cne-enhancer .

in 48/ <dig> unduplicated cne-enhancers we noticed that more than one syntenically conserved gene  are showing analogy in expression pattern with the cne-enhancer. in this case, two or more genes are declared as target for the relevant cne-enhancer . for instance, a human cne-enhancer  on has <dig> , revealed conserved syntenic association with hey <dig> and stmn <dig> in all the compared orthologous loci . furthermore, reported endogenous expression pattern of both of these genes matches with the reporter expression pattern induced by the cne-enhancer . therefore, we assigned both hey <dig> and stmn <dig> as target genes for this human enhancer region .

range of action of human cis-acting sites
once the enhancers were assigned to their probable targets we then set out to use these associations as a training dataset to gauge the maximum distance at which an enhancer can act upon its target gene body. distance between the enhancer and its target gene is of significant importance because it is an important aspect to understand regulatory mechanism of cnes and there are also several human genetic disorders that are associated with the disruption in the genomic distance between enhancer and its associated gene  <cit> . we estimated the percentage of human cne-enhancers whose target gene bodies are positioned within the ranges, e.g. 0-200 kb, 201-400 kb, 401-600 kb, 601-999 kb and even >1 mb . we also counted the number of cnes positioned within the intronic intervals of their target genes. these results show that a substantial proportion of human enhancers  reside within the intronic interval of genes they regulate  . our data further shows that more than a third of human enhancers  are > 400 kb away from their assigned gene body . intriguingly, 40% of these long-range enhancers  have predicted targets at a distance of >1 mb. among these extreme long-range enhancers  nine are positioned > <dig>  mb away from their target genes . for instance, comparative syntenic analysis of a human cne-enhancer  residing on chr5q <dig>   and comparison of reported endogenous expression pattern of neighboring genes revealed that this cis-acting site regulates the hindbrain specific expression of human nr2f <dig> gene from a distance of  <dig>  mb .

it is often assumed that cis-acting regulatory sites act on the nearest neighboring genes and therefore the conventional search space for enhancers includes immediate upstream or downstream intervals of genes of interest. however, some examples exist where enhancers skip nearby promoters and specifically act on distantly located genes  <cit> . for instance, tissue specific expression of developmentally important shh <cit>  and sox <dig> <cit>  genes were found to be regulated by enhancers positioned ~1 mb away from their transcription start site. intriguingly, in this study substantial proportion  of enhancer-target gene associations are established at ≥ 1 mb genomic interval and thus firmly establishing the fact that long-range spatial interaction among regulatory sites and their target gene bodies are not rare exceptions but occur on pervasive scale . consequently, this would imply that assignment of full complement of regulatory sites that act upon a single gene of interest can be seriously impeded by extreme site separation and this could in turn hinder attempts to associate disease causing non-coding mutations with their concerned gene bodies. rigorously defined enhancer-target gene associations established in this study enable us to underscore the idea that linear proximity  rule is inadequate for the identification of cis-regulatory regions and thus extends the previously established maximum search space for enhancers from 2 mb dna template around the gene of interest to 4 mb dna template  around the gene of interest .

cns specific transcriptional factor code
in higher eukaryotes the cell type specific or temporal specific influence of enhancer on their target genes is implemented through interactions of these cis-regulatory modules with tfs. the co-occurrence of distinct set of tfs  with each type of binding site represented many times within the same regulatory region  are the key features of tf interaction networks in complex metazoan  <cit> . an important feature of homotypic site clustering is that it facilitates cooperative binding of factors that interacts to moderate or weaker sites  <cit> . numerous transcription factors work in concert to regulate target genes in a developmental, cell, or tissue-specific manner. typically, specific type of cooperativity  is required to regulate diverse set of genes exhibiting temporally and spatially synchronized expression   <cit> . for example, skeletal-muscle-specific expression of distinct gene sets has been associated with the cooperative interactions among at least five tfs: mef- <dig>  myf, sp <dig>  srf, and tef  <cit> . prediction of transcription factor cooperativity has been carried out in yeast and human but unfortunately our current knowledge about combinations of tfs that contributes to the tissue specificity of cis-regulatory modules is limited. this in turn has limited the large scale bioinformatics study of tissue-specific gene regulation.

here we seek to identify tfs that act cooperatively to define cns  specificity of an enhancer. for this purpose, among the selected subset of distant acting developmental enhancers we choose the one for which reproducible cns-specific activity has been shown in vivo in e <dig>  mouse embryos  <cit> . this data set consists of 159/ <dig> elements, majority  of which are explicitly associated with single target gene . given the fact that a typical binding motif for tf can be as short as 5-8 bp, in silico matches to such short motifs occur frequently by chance alone, with many of these predicted sites presumably non-functional. therefore, a major challenge in computational identification of such motifs that must be overcome is distinguishing functional tfbss from spurious motif matches. in order to better define biologically relevant combinations of tfs, while analyzing each brain specific cis-regulatory module for an input set of known tfs we focused on:  evolutionary conservation of each enhancer across human and mouse lineages;  conserved binding motifs that occurred more than once in an enhancer. this stringent criterion combining the technique of phylogenetic foot printing and possibilities of occurrence of homotypic interactions within typical metazoan enhancers reveals that the brain specific cis-regulatory modules have evolutionary conserved binding site preferences for sox <dig>  hfh, sox <dig>  c-fos, hnf3β, c-rel, mef <dig>  nmyc, usf, freac, tal1beta-e47s, nf-kappab, aml <dig> and arnt, the fourteen transcriptional factors .

the cne enhancers across the  <dig> tfs of training data set are then developed as a matrix x¯159× <dig> and non-conserved/non-coding elements  across the  <dig> tfs of the control data set developed as a matrix y¯100× <dig>  the two correlation matrices of the training and control data sets developed as rx = [rij2
] and ry = [rij2
] and revealed the pattern of tfs existing in the two comparative data sets . in the training data set a specific pattern of tf interactions is exposed by the formation of three distinctive groups of tfs with strong within and poor or no correlation among the groups, leaving aside two tfs: tal1beta-e47s and mef. these two are neither correlated between nor with any other member of the three groups formed. here the findings of rx = [rij2
] may be grouped into three clusters configuration as,

➢ cluster-1: n-myc, arnt, usf 

➢ cluster-2: c-rel, nf-kappab 

➢ cluster-3: freac, aml- <dig>  c-fos, hnf3-β, sox <dig>  hfh, sox <dig> 

the ry = [rij2
] present findings in contrast with the above three cluster structure found from the rx = [rij2
]. apart from a highly correlated group of three tfs similar to cluster- <dig>  not any other group structure is seen with the remaining tfs  in the control data set. a presumption of a non-interactive pattern of tfs in the control data set may be considered here.

the probability table  provides a similar perception of a group structure of tfs present in the x¯159× <dig> and non co-occurrence pattern of tfs in y¯100× <dig>  it is readily seen that the least of an pi in group- <dig>  of the training data set is not less than 59% . higher the pi more likely is the co-occurrence of tfs in the elements . in contrast, a lesser pi may not be attributed to a less likely co-occurrence pattern of a tf. since a pi simply defines a degree that a tf is likely to occur in an element, so lower pi are not mere reflections of less likely co-occurrence of tfs within the elements. yet the likelihood of the co-occurrence pattern of these tfs cannot be overruled, since any tf that is less frequent across the elements may be co-occurring with another tf or tfs. the occurrence of all the fourteen tfs in the control data set are less frequent with  <dig>  ≤ pi ≤  <dig>  compared with the proportion of tfs in group- <dig> of the training data set . this quantifies the significance of likely co-occurrence of tfs in group- <dig> of the training data set.

* tfs with p greater than  <dig>  defined as group- <dig>  the table present sr. no  <dig> to  <dig> in training data set as the only group of tfs with high probability of tfs so the most likely co-occurring tfs in cns brain specific enhancers compared to tfs with p less than  <dig>  in training and control data sets.

final identification of the cluster structures in the binding site preferences of the training and control data set is achieved with the application of principal component analysis . the pca on x¯159× <dig> and x¯100× <dig> using rx =  and ry =  respectively validated the heterotypic clustering pattern of tfs perceived so far in the training data set, in a 3d loading plot of the first three principal components . the first three pcs explained 60% of the total variation present in the patterned correlated data set of x¯159× <dig>  the 3d loading plot  of the first  <dig> pcs derived from pca on control data exposed a scenario of non-interactive pattern of tfs across the non-conserved and non-coding elements, a wide contrast to the interactive pattern of tfs across the cns enhancers in the training data set . the 3d loading plot  exhibits clarity of three distinct sets of closely packed tfs, i.e. three cluster configurations of tfs. the cluster configuration presented coincide with the cluster configuration perceived in rx = [rij2
], in addition to merging the two insignificant tfs: tal1beta-e47s and mef in cluster- <dig>  the two tfs with pi less than  <dig>  are co-occurring with the tfs packed in cluster- <dig> so are merged in it. thus cluster- <dig> in the training data set takes the form,

❖ cluster-3: talb-e47s, mef, freac, aml- <dig>  c-fos, hnf3-β, sox <dig>  hfh, sox <dig> 

we may conclude that there are three distinct clusters of tf internally interactive and showing brain specific cis-regulatory modules binding site preferences in the training data set. the statistical significance of pattern of tfs interactions in the training data set exposed are well supported by the probability table , the correlation matrix  interpreted as r = [rij2
] and are further statistically significant with the control results of non-conserved and non-coding elements.

to validate in silico predicted tissue specific tf code, an essential prerequisite is to depend upon experimentally determined relevance of tfs to the tissue of interest. therefore, we consulted the literature and mgi  <cit>  gene expression database  project, and investigated the reported rna in-situ hybridization based endogenous gene expression pattern for each of the predicted tf. intriguingly, we found that our predictions are enriched in cns specific expression during early mouse development . thus biological knowledge provides a crucial support to the quality of in silico predicted cooperation among specific set of transcription factors to regulate the cns specific co-expressed genes. this analysis not only provides the list of tfs that may play a crucial role in cns specific gene regulation but also provides information about cooperation between distinct set of factors . furthermore, cns specific transcription factor code defined in this study can act as a priori knowledge in large scale bioinformatics studies aimed at identifying cis-regulatory modules involved in neural tube specific gene regulation.

this table also provides references of literature  that addresses the type/function and endogenous expression pattern of transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
metazoan cis-regulatory landscape is complex, with modular organization and widespread spatial distribution around the target genes. this complexity hampers attempt to localize and catalog the entire repertoire of enhancers that orchestrate spatially and temporally diverse expression patterns for single gene of interest. recent relatively high throughput transgenic mice assay based studies generated the genome-wide experimentally validated data set for hundreds of human enhancers. regulatory activities of each of these enhancers were confirmed through enhancer induced lacz reporter expression in e <dig>  mice embryos and tissue specificity of expression was also described. such genome-wide collections of enhancer data set are expected to contribute immensely in understanding i) structural anatomy of metazoan enhancers ii) mechanisms of enhancer-target gene interactions iii) comprehensively catalog the genetic regulatory circuits for developmentally critical genes iv) role of cis-regulatory mutations/alterations in development and disease. however, the utility of these in vivo characterized enhancers for variety of biological applications requires their systematic association with target gene bodies. this study is an attempt to systematically associate subset of these functionally defined enhancers with their target genes and thus establishing regulatory interactions for dozens of human genes. these explicit associations would enable the screening of this subset of enhancers for those pathogenic mutations not affecting the coding sequences of concerned genes but disrupting the functionality of these cis-acting regulatory sites and thus altering temporal, spatial and quantitative aspects of gene expression. furthermore, assigning enhancers to bona fide target genes assisted us to gauge maximum range at which an enhancer can access its target promoter and delineated the fact that in human genome long-range regulatory interactions occur more frequently and involve longer distances than was previously anticipated. maximum range of enhancer action reported in this study should serve as a guideline when analyzing the chromosomal deletions/rearrangements associated disorders; such as locus alternations are known to disrupt communication among distant regulatory sites and their target genes.

gene regulation is exerted by cooperative interactions among tfs that binds to clusters of sites within cis-regulatory regions. distinct cis-regulatory modules direct reporter expressions selectively in a particular cell/tissue specific manner are likely to interact with similar set of tfs and thus defining the tfbss code for co-expressed genes. in this respect, given the abundant set of experimentally defined regulatory sequences, which is sufficient to direct expression of a reporter gene in a cell-specific pattern and list of tfs that are known to be relevant to that tissue, it is possible to construct biologically relevant, tissue specific, complex heterotypic tfs cluster model. under this assumption, among the cne-enhancers linked to their target genes we analyzed the large subset of regions that direct gene expression selectively to cns and defined combinatorial heterotypic interactions of multiple tfs that are likely to bind to typical cns specific cis-regulatory module. this analysis not only figures out the generalized structure of typical cns specific enhancer, but has established tf interaction network that can be used as training data set for large scale identification of cns specific enhancers.
