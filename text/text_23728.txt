BACKGROUND
nectar is the principal reward offered by flowering plants to attract pollinators  <cit> ; this sugary solution is secreted from floral organs known as nectaries. the complexity of nectar composition has been revealed through many studies on a wide variety of species. in addition to simple sugars   <cit> ), nearly all nectars contain an assortment of ancillary components, including: amino acids  <cit> , organic acids  <cit> , terpenes  <cit> , alkaloids  <cit> , flavonoids  <cit> , glycosides  <cit> , vitamins  <cit> , phenolics  <cit> , metal ions  <cit> , oils  <cit> , free fatty acids  <cit> , and proteins  <cit> . surprisingly, the means by which these compounds arise in nectar are poorly defined. studies conducted on nectariferous tissue  have traditionally focused on nectar composition, nectary anatomy, and physiological aspects of nectar secretion. only recently has the goal of identifying the genetic mechanisms regulating nectary development, and nectar production, begun to receive more attention.

the arabidopsis thaliana 'nectarium' consists of two pairs of nectaries, lateral and median . the two lateral nectaries  are longitudinally opposed to one another just outside the base of short stamen, and are bounded by petal insertion sites. the two median nectaries  also occur on opposite sides of the flower but only between the insertion points of two long stamen. interestingly, these two nectary types are morphologically and functionally distinct, with lateral nectaries producing the bulk of the nectar , and median nectaries producing little or no nectar  <cit> . while lateral nectaries are regularly supplied with an abundance of phloem, by comparison, the median nectaries are subtended by only a small number of sieve tubes  <cit> .

despite the near absence of genetic information about the regulation of nectary form and function, some aspects of nectary biology have been extensively studied. for example, the morphology of nectaries from a number of species has been closely examined and, as a result, there is a clear understanding  of some of the processes that occur in nectariferous tissue . for example, at the onset of nectar production and secretion in arabidopsis, small vacuoles, in a dense cytoplasm, are evident in presecretory nectariferous cells  <cit> . as these cells begin to actively secrete nectar, vacuole size, endoplasmic reticulum activity, and mitochondrial number all increase  <cit> . conversely, dictyosome number decreases and plastid starch grains, which presumably serve as a source of nectar carbohydrate, also become smaller immediately before secretion  <cit> . in addition, nectary cells likely have high levels of cellular respiration, as evidenced by the abundance of mitochondria with well-developed cristae in nectaries from multiple species  <cit> . while these ultrastructural features of arabidopsis nectaries are known, the precise physical mechanism of secretion is still an open question  <cit> .

a prevailing view of merocrine-type nectar secretion, used by arabidopsis and most other nectar producing plants, suggests that some or nearly all pre-nectar metabolites  are transported symplastically  via plasmodesmata in nectary parenchyma cells. here they are stored in secretory cells at or near the nectary surface  <cit> . immediately prior to secretion, it is thought that starch grains are degraded and most metabolites are packaged into endoplasmic reticulum  and/or golgi-derived vesicles and secreted via fusion with the plasma membrane . in fact, ultrastructural analyses have repeatedly demonstrated the presence of extensive er and golgi networks in nectary secretory cells  <cit> . the model described above does not necessarily discount the direct involvement of plasma membrane transporters in the movement of solutes into nectar . interestingly, a number of plant species, including arabidopsis, have nectaries with large numbers of modified stomata on their epithelia  <cit> . it is presumed these stomata are the location where direct nectar secretion from the nectary occurs.

to date, only a few individual genes have been associated with aspects of nectary development: crabs claw, blade-on-petiole   <dig> and bop <dig>  <cit> . crc knockout mutants fail to develop nectaries, whereas bop1/bop <dig> double mutant lines have significantly smaller nectaries along with aberrant morphologies  <cit> . while, crc expression alone is necessary, it will not promote ectopic nectary development; this indicates that additional genetic elements might exist that restrict nectary development to the third whorl of the arabidopsis flower  <cit> . other floral organ identity genes have demonstrated or proposed roles in regulating crc expression, although none of these genes alone are required for normal nectary development. some of these genes include: leafy, ufo, agamous, shatterproof1/ <dig>  apetala2/ <dig>  pistillata, and sepallata1/2/ <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the above, a number of nectary-enriched genes have been identified from multiple species .

the currently small picture of transcription factors and their downstream targets in nectaries limits our understanding of pathways and cellular processes critical for nectary development and function. thus, a genome-wide evaluation of gene expression in nectaries could shed some light on key mediators of nectar production. microarrays have been used to examine gene expression in a wide variety of tissues, and under a broad set of conditions, in arabidopsis . however, to date, no genome-wide information on gene expression in nectaries has been reported for arabidopsis, or any other species. the current lack of global gene expression profiles for nectariferous tissue could possibly be linked to the diminutive nature of arabidopsis nectaries  and the laborious process associated with manual nectary collection.

arabidopsis flowers are highly self-fertile, which begs the question as to why these plants would bother to develop functional nectaries; however, solitary bees, flies, and thrips do visit arabidopsis flowers in the wild, and a small amount of outcrossing does occur  <cit> . significantly, many brassicaceae species  share similar nectarium structure with arabidopsis, and produce relatively large amounts of nectar  <cit> . in general, these species are highly dependent on pollinator visitation to achieve efficient pollination  <cit> . arabidopsis nectaries also appear to share similar developmental mechanisms with a large portion of the eudicot clade  <cit> . thus, arabidopsis, with its fully sequenced genome and genetic resources, can serve as a valuable model for examining nectary development and function in plants.

here we describe the isolation, amplification, and labeling of transcripts from arabidopsis nectaries, leading up to an analysis of temporal and spatial gene expression using affymetrix® arabidopsis genechip ath <dig> arrays. we have employed a large-scale analysis of the arabidopsis nectary transcriptome in order to develop a more complete picture of the genetic programming fundamental to nectar production and secretion. we identify a subset of genes preferentially expressed in nectaries, and distinguish the gene complement upregulated in actively secreting nectaries compared to immature and non-secretory nectaries. potential genes and pathways involved in nectary development and function are discussed. the resultant data provide a starting-point for reverse genetics approaches to identify specific genes integral to nectar synthesis and secretion.

RESULTS
nectary samples
floral nectaries are responsible for producing the complex mixture of compounds found in nectar. surprisingly, a global picture of gene expression in nectaries is currently lacking; however, arabidopsis nectaries are loosely connected to adjacent floral tissues and can be manually dissected from local non-nectariferous tissues . individual arabidopsis nectaries are extremely small, thus ~200– <dig> nectaries were pooled and processed as single biological replicates as indicated in table  <dig> . specifically, rna was isolated from immature lateral nectaries , mature lateral nectaries , and mature median nectaries . typical isolations yielded ~ <dig> to  <dig> ng of total rna, and were processed for mircroarray hybridizations following a single round of rna amplification.

a as defined by smyth et al.,  <dig>  <cit> 

each of the following parameters demonstrated the quality of hybridization and scanning for all nectary samples: signal gradient severity on each chip was under  <dig> ; outlier area was less than  <dig> %; the 3'/5' ratio of housekeeping genes  were less than  <dig> , 'present' call ranges were 40~50%; average intensity ranged from  <dig> to 618; and all biological replicates consistently had correlations greater than 96%. after quality evaluation, nectary data were then co-normalized with  <dig> publicly available .cel files representing  <dig> tissues at multiple developmental stages   <cit> .

hybridization data were processed with the expressionist® analyst module to call gene expression as 'present' or 'absent' in all biological replicates of the nectary tissues examined . the number of genes called 'present' in all replicates for each nectary type were: iln,  <dig> ; mln,  <dig> ; mmn,  <dig> . all together,  <dig>  genes were confidently expressed in all replicates of one or more nectary tissues, with  <dig>  genes being called 'present'  in all nectary experiments. a full list of 'present' genes, along with normalized probe signal values, can be found in additional file  <dig> 

genes preferentially expressed within nectary tissues
we foremost wished to identify genes preferentially expressed in nectary tissues since they are likely to be key mediators of nectary development and function. thus, as mentioned above, we obtained  <dig> previously published ath <dig> array data files representing  <dig> tissues at multiple developmental stages . expression data for all probes were co-normalized to the median probe cell intensity with our nectary samples as described in the methods section . we subsequently calculated normalized signal ratios of individual nectary types against each individual reference tissue. a t-test p value cutoff of  <dig>  in probe set signal intensity and a fdr q-value cutoff of  <dig>  were initially used to identify genes significantly upregulated in each nectary type over each individual tissue; for downstream analyses, all genes displaying a three-fold or greater increase in probe signal intensity in at least one nectary type  over each individual non-nectary reference tissue were determined . the three-fold cutoff for signal intensity ratio was utilized in this instance to allow a focus on a relatively small number of genes with relatively high enrichment in nectaries, as they are likely key mediators of nectary form and function. a graphical representation of the signal profiles for all 'significant' genes is displayed in figure 2b. ultimately, this analysis identified  <dig> genes upregulated in one or more of the nectary tissues over each individual reference tissue, with the resultant genes being listed in additional file  <dig> 

a number of 'present' genes displaying a 3-fold or greater difference in probe signal intensity in iln, mln, & mmn over each individual non-nectary reference tissue; a t-test p value cutoff of  <dig> , and false discovery rate  q value cutoff of  <dig>  were initially applied to identify genes with significant differences in expression. the highest q value observed for any individual gene after applying the 3-fold cutoff was  <dig> .

b the overlapped common gene number represents those genes displaying significant changes that were expressed 3-fold or higher in a given nectary type over all individual reference tissues. the genes identified from this analysis were used to generate additional file 7; a total of  <dig> unique genes were found to be upregulated in one or more nectary types over all individual reference tissues.

all plants used for nectary collection were grown under a  <dig> hour light/ <dig> hour dark cycle, with nectary isolation occurring from 4– <dig> hours after dawn . the rationale for this growth and collection scheme was that arabidopsis flowers fully open by ~ <dig> h.a.d., and nectar production in closely related brassica napus peaks from mid-morning to mid-day   <cit> . thus we wished to capture gene expression profiles in nectaries occurring during periods of active secretion. an important item for consideration when evaluating the co-normalized probe signal values described above is that the downloaded atgenexpress gene expression data  were obtained from plants grown under continuous  light conditions. considering that roughly 11% of arabidopsis genes display diurnal changes in expression , some of the observations in this study may be due to differences in the growth conditions used. despite the use of different light regimes, comparisons between nectary and atgenexpress microarray data confirmed the expression of multiple genes known to be upregulated in nectary tissues . moreover, the expression patterns of multiple nectary-enriched genes identified through comparisons of co-normalized probe signal values were later validated by rt pcr . finally, there is also precedent in the literature for making this kind of comparison with atgenexpress data , which further validates the type of analysis presented here. thus, while the use of identical growth conditions for all plants would have been ideal for these comparisons, taking advantage of the large publicly available data sets and co-normalizing it with the nectary data presented here provides a means for identifying genes and pathways with nectary-enriched expression profiles.

differential expression of genes between nectary types and developmental stages
individual nectary types were also compared to one another to identify differentially expressed genes, which may be involved in nectary maturation and nectar secretion. for example, all genes 'present' in at least one nectary type and displaying a two-fold or greater difference in expression between different nectary types were determined . genes having similar expression levels in all nectary types were also identified . an additional  <dig>  genes displayed fold changes greater than two between nectary tissues; however, these changes were not statistically significant .

for a more in-depth analysis of genes displaying the largest differences in expression, lists of genes displaying five-fold or greater differences in expression level between mln versus iln, and mln versus mmn, are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the difference in gene expression between immature lateral nectaries  and mature lateral nectaries  was substantial, with  <dig> genes displaying five-fold or greater signal ratios between the two sample types . conversely, the signal profiles of mln and mature median nectaries  were remarkably similar, with only  <dig> genes displaying a five-fold or greater difference . amongst these  <dig> genes, only a single gene  had at least a five-fold higher signal value in mln compared to mmn; the remaining  <dig> differentially expressed genes were five-fold or higher in mmn over mln. again, for additional files  <dig> & <dig>  genes were manually compiled into ontology groups pertinent to nectary development and function based upon functional analysis, tair annotations, and literature searches.

validation of gene expression
to validate the expression patterns observed by microarray, rt pcr was utilized. rna was isolated from  <dig> tissues  generally represented within our normalized data sets, reverse transcribed, and subjected to pcr. results shown in figure  <dig> demonstrate the nectary-enriched nature of  <dig> genes, with several of the genes also supporting the changes observed between nectary types via microarray . several other pieces of evidence support this overall analysis: 1) promoter::reporter fusions and in situ hybridizations previously confirmed the nectary-enriched expression of multiple genes reported here ; and, 2) an examination of over  <dig>  brassica rapa ests derived from nectary cdna libraries, along with corresponding rt pcr analyses, also back the current findings .

as another test of the veracity of this type of co-normalization and subsequent analysis, the expression values for eight genes with known nectary-enriched expression profiles were examined . each of these genes had a minimum nine-fold greater probe signal value in nectaries  over the reference tissue average, with individual nectary types displaying higher expression levels over most individual reference tissues .

biological processes enriched in nectaries
all genes commonly upregulated in nectaries , when compared to individual reference tissues , were assigned into go biological process categories. processes showing significant differences between tissues were identified  and are graphically represented by the heat maps displayed in figure  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . this analysis identified several biological processes overrepresented amongst nectary-enriched genes. the biological processes particularly overrepresented in nectaries, when compared to reference tissues, fell within the general categories of lipid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism . a number of upregulated genes putatively relating to these processes are discussed below.

transcription processes were also apparently enriched within nectaries . for example,  <dig> known and putative transcription factors were found to have enriched expression in one or more nectary types versus non-nectary tissues , with a significant subset showing differential expression between nectaries . a number of previous studies have implicated various transcription factors in nectary development, all displaying apparently high expression within nectaries  <cit> . indeed, these findings are reflected in our results, with crc , agl5/shp <dig> , agl1/shp <dig> , agamous  and apetala <dig>  all showing nectary-enriched expression profiles. curiously, while transcription processes were overrepresented, translation processes were apparently depleted amongst the upregulated genes .

the canonical sucrose biosynthesis pathway is upregulated in nectaries
since sugars are the principal solutes in most nectars, it is expected that genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport should be well-represented within the nectary transcriptome. indeed this is the case, as nearly one dozen sugar metabolizing and modifying genes appear to be preferentially expressed in nectariferous tissues compared to non-nectary tissues . in addition, we specifically focused on the expression of genes involved in sucrose metabolism. results summarized in figure  <dig> demonstrate the identification of genes upregulated in nectaries that are putatively involved in sucrose biosynthesis, transport and extracellular hydrolysis. in nearly all instances, these genes had higher probe signal intensities within secretory nectaries  versus each individual reference tissue . experimental evidence has verified the upregulation of both sucrose synthase  <cit>  and cell wall invertase within arabidopsis nectaries .

identification of promoter motifs within nectary-enriched genes
the large numbers of genes displaying nectary-enriched expression profiles suggests common mechanisms for restricting and/or activating their expression within these secretory organs. an analysis of  <dig> genes highly and commonly upregulated in multiple nectary types  was performed to identify potential cis-acting promoter elements. this analysis identified two dna sequence motifs particularly overrepresented within the promoters of nectary-enriched genes, myb <dig> and cargcw8gat. table  <dig> displays the relative frequency, location and significance of these elements occurring within the promoters of these genes. further information on the myb <dig> and cargcw8gat promoter motifs are discussed below.

discussion
gene expression profiles in different arabidopsis tissue types have been extensively compared to one another in order to identify tissue-specific gene expression, especially as it relates to tissue function  <cit> . significantly, the probe signals from a wide range of independent hybridization experiments can be co-normalized and used to identify differentially expressed genes. for example, the genevestigator gene atlas houses co-normalized probe signal values for ~ <dig>  arabidopsis hybridization experiments  representing over  <dig> different arabidopsis tissues and cell types  <cit> . this tool is widely used to examine differential gene expression between tissues, as well as between different growth and treatment conditions, all at the same time . however, there is currently no report on gene expression profile comparisons between different nectary tissue types or between nectary and non-nectary tissues.

in this study, we systematically interrogated global differences in gene expression between nectaries and non-nectary reference tissues, as well as between nectary types and developmental stages. functional classification and analysis of genes upregulated in nectaries versus non-nectary tissues , along with genes differentially expressed between secretory and non-secretory nectary tissues  may reveal candidate genes involved in nectar production and secretion. discussed below are several roles these differentially expressed genes and pathways may play in nectary form and function. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a systematic and global interrogation of any nectary transcriptome.

not surprisingly, a large number of genes involved in sugar metabolism and processing were differentially expressed between nectary and reference tissues , as well as between nectary tissues themselves . this is in agreement with expectations, as simple sugars are the principal solutes in most nectars. in arabidopsis phloem sap, the primary sugar is sucrose, while hexoses dominate in the nectar. for example, the sucrose/hexose ratio of arabidopsis  nectar is approximately  <dig>   <cit> . resultantly, arabidopsis nectar would be considered hexose-dominant. the compositional differences between arabidopsis nectar and phloem photosynthate imply that the phloem "pre-nectar" is modified to yield "mature" nectar, and indeed this proposed process has been supported by a number of studies . in order to maintain the net flow of carbohydrates from source tissues  to sink tissues like the nectaries, biochemical and physiological processes must be actively maintaining the sink status of nectaries. for example, bowman  <cit>  noted starch accumulation in arabidopsis lateral nectaries ; specifically, the guard cells showed the most intense staining. moreover, according to baum et al.  <cit> , starch-containing plastids are visible in arabidopsis nectary parenchyma cells from the onset of nectary development, which are apparently degraded just prior to anthesis and nectar secretion  <cit> . it seems likely that both the modification of phloem sap to nectar and the maintenance of nectaries as a sink tissue are interrelated and even involve many of the same genes.

the coordinated control of sugar transport and metabolism in plant cells and tissues is achieved through the action of sugar modifying enzymes and sugar transporters, both of which play roles in establishing and maintaining sugar concentrations across membranes  <cit> . for example, invertases are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose, which can then be selectively transported across membranes by hexose transporters and/or help create a sucrose gradient. significantly, nearly all arabidopsis invertase genes  appeared to be upregulated in nectaries, while invertase inhibitor genes seemed to be downregulated in actively secreting nectaries . in particular, at2g <dig>  encoding arabidopsis thaliana cell wall invertase  <dig> , was strongly upregulated in nectaries . previously, atcwinv <dig> expression was shown to be high in floral tissues  <cit> ; however, even within floral tissues, expression in nectaries, as observed by microarray, appears pronounced. it is tempting to speculate that this extracellular invertase is at least partly responsible for the hexose-rich nectars observed in arabidopsis and related members of the brassicaceae. it may even play a role in maintaining a high intracellular:extracellular sucrose gradient, thus promoting sucrose transport out of nectariferous cells, along with water and other metabolites. indeed this is likely the case, as cwinv <dig> t-dna mutants fail to produce nectar and show marked differences in starch accumulation within flowers .

in addition to invertases, we identified a number of genes upregulated in nectaries involved in other aspects of simple sugar metabolism, with some including: sucrose synthase , putative sucrose-phosphate synthase , putative udp-glucose 4-epimerase , two udp-glucoronosyl/udp-glucosyl transferase family proteins  and hexokinase  <dig> . significantly, these genes can be tentatively assigned functions in sucrose synthesis/degradation , and are likely involved in defining nectar sugar composition. indeed, the full canonical sucrose biosynthesis pathway was represented by genes upregulated within mature lateral nectaries over individual reference tissues . upregulation of both sucrose synthase  <cit>  and cell wall invertase  within arabidopsis nectaries was experimentally verified previously.

transcription processes were also highly represented within nectary expressed genes , with  <dig> of these genes displaying nectary-enriched expression profiles . members of the yabby transcription factor gene family–numbering six in arabidopsis –are determinants of abaxial cell fate in the lateral floral organs  <cit> . as previously mentioned, crabs claw  encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of carpel and nectary development  <cit> . crc is currently the only known gene to be absolutely required for nectary development; here we have identified several other transcription factors preferentially expressed in nectary tissue that could possibly be involved in either restricting crc expression to the base of the stamens or in some other aspect of nectary development or function. for example, lee et al.  <cit>  state that there is a "lack of evidence for any other yabby gene family member expressing in the nectaries." however, here we evince the preferential expression of yabby <dig>  in nectaries, and since this transcription factor belongs to the same family as crc, it too could potentially be involved in mediating nectary development; it had significantly higher signal probe intensities in nectaries over the reference tissue average , and appeared to have relatively constant expression throughout the nectary tissues examined by microarray and rt pcr .

in addition to transcription factors specifically upregulated in nectaries, some displayed differences between nectary type or developmental stage. for example, the only gene upregulated 5-fold or more in mln compared to mmn was at2g <dig>  a myb family transcription factor; probe signal intensity of this gene was also increased greater than 5-fold in mln over iln, and 9-fold over the reference tissue average. since transcription factors modulate the expression of other genes, the involvement of this single gene in differentiating mln from other tissues could be substantial. conversely, at4g <dig>  a putative ap <dig> domain-containing transcription factor, was upregulated in mmn compared with mln  and iln , and was also upregulated over all reference tissues examined . a separate myb gene  was highly expressed in both mln and mmn, but not iln, with an overall probe signal increase in nectaries over reference tissues of ~28-fold. potentially, these genes are involved in differentiating median from lateral, or immature from mature nectaries.

related to the identification of upregulated transcription factors described above, promoter motifs are short dna sequences that transcription factors bind to in order to affect the expression of other genes. this is significant within a biological context, as a single transcription factor can simultaneously govern the expression of many other genes , provided that the promoter regions of the affected genes contain the dna sequence motif in question. myb <dig> and cargcw8gat promoter motifs were particularly overrepresented within the promoters of nectary-enriched genes . significantly, several carg boxes were previously identified as key regulators of crc expression within nectaries  <cit> . the carg promoter motif  is the canonical target for agamous and related mads box proteins, though the cargcw8gat motif variant  is a known target of agamous-like mads box protein  <dig>  specifically. agl <dig> is primarily expressed in developing embryos  <cit> , but is apparently expressed at very low levels within nectaries . however, several other mads box-family genes were highly upregulated in nectaries, including agamous itself, and the functionally redundant shatterproof genes, agl <dig> and agl <dig> . these data are consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

the myb <dig> binding motif  was also highly represented in the promoters of nectary-enriched genes . myb <dig> is a direct transcriptional repressor of the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase gene , and can also suppress the expression of chalcone synthase  when overexpressed  <cit> . c4h and chs are involved in the synthesis of hydroxycinnamate esters and flavonoids, respectively, both of which are ultimately known to provide protection from uv-b radiation  <cit> . curiously, by microarray myb <dig> was highly upregulated within nectaries , whereas c4h and chs were strongly repressed  when compared to reference tissues , which supports the known functions of myb <dig>  nonetheless, it is tempting to speculate that myb <dig>  or one of the four other myb family proteins upregulated in nectaries , may be involved in the regulation or even activation of nectary-specific genes. indeed, myb family transcription factors were previously implicated in the regulation of the nectary-specific nectarin  <dig> gene in tobacco  <cit> . while more work needs to be done, the prevalence of myb <dig> and cargcw8gat promoter motifs within nectary-specific genes suggests that they may provide a basis for regulating nectary-specific gene expression.

finally, it should be noted that multiple genes involved in aspects of lipid metabolism , and auxin transport and response , were identified as being highly upregulated in nectaries by both microarray and rt pcr. these findings are significant in that both lipid and auxin processes have been suggested to play roles in nectary development and nectar secretion ; however, the exact functions these upregulated genes in nectary function is currently unclear.

CONCLUSIONS
by microarray analysis we have identified a large number of genes preferentially expressed in, and between, nectaries. this information now allows for a rapid and targeted reverse genetics approach for identifying key mediators of nectary form and function. due to its central role in pollination, determining the molecular basis of nectar production can have broad implications, ranging from understanding the co-evolution of plants and animals, to increasing yields in multiple pollinator-dependent crop species.
