BACKGROUND
microarrays and other whole genome methods are increasingly being applied to examine transcription patterns relevant for ecology and evolution in wild populations . one of the obstacles to applying this technology to non-model organisms is sufficient sequence data from which array features can be designed. because of this, many of the arrays used for non-model organisms have been cdna arrays spotted from cdna clones since whole-genome sequence information does not exist . this limits the number of genes to those found in cdna libraries which may not be representative of the whole genome. additionally, in many cases heterologous hybridizations are used where one uses an array designed from another closely related species . however, for many study organisms this is not feasible since the species of interest are evolutionarily too distant from species for which a microarray is available.

the evolutionary significance of three-spine stickleback  stems from its well-documented history of parallel episodes of colonization from marine habitats followed by population divergence  <cit> . phenotypic divergence has resulted in trophic morphs  <cit> , variation in lateral plate numbers  <cit> , and pelvic reduction  <cit> . many of these morphotypes can be associated with selective pressures of a given habitat   <cit> . the genetic architecture of several adaptive traits  has been known for a number of years  <cit>  and yet, despite the efforts to identify genes responsible for phenotypic traits important for adaptive divergence, only two genes have been suggested as playing a role in these processes, eda and pixt <dig>  <cit> . therefore, tools to study adaptive evolution at the transcriptome level would be of great value for gaining a deeper understanding of the evolution of this organism.

the three-spine stickleback was one of the first ecological and evolutionary model species to have its genome sequenced .

however, the full potential of a whole-transcriptome analysis has yet to be fully realized for this species; despite having a sequenced genome, only one cdna microarray, based on est sequences, has been published for use with sticklebacks  <cit> . this array contains  <dig>  clones which is less than half of the estimated gene number in the stickleback genome.

in an effort to develop tools to facilitate transcriptomic studies in three-spine sticklebacks, we used known genes and novel gene predictions from the sequenced genome of three-spine stickleback in ensembl to create probes for use with the agilent microarray format. in this array design,  <dig>  probes were created representing  <dig>  genes which is approximately 93% of the estimated genome . this array design accounts for differential splicing by creating transcript-specific probes whenever possible. since these probes are created in situ for the agilent array platform, the actual array design is flexible and can be modified to suit the needs of specific experiments, and user-designed probes can also be added. we demonstrate the utility of the array through examining hybridization success of dna from  <dig> individuals from a total of four populations as well as rna from  <dig> individuals from a total of three populations.

RESULTS
probe design
from  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>  unique probes representing  <dig>  genes were selected . since these probes were designed to be transcript specific, splice variants were represented in the probe design if possible. in addition, since the number of features on the array allowed for more than the number of predicted transcripts, two different probes were designed for each transcript if possible. for  <dig>  genes, between  <dig> and  <dig> probes were designed and for the remaining  <dig> genes, only one probe was designed. for  <dig>  transcripts the probes were very similar, differing by just  <dig> to  <dig> bases in sequence position along the transcript. despite having almost the same sequence, these probes were retained in the initial design since it was unclear how similar fish from the european lineage would be to those from the sequenced lineage , and base pair differences can impact the binding affinity depending on the location of the mismatch  <cit> . however for most transcripts, when rna was hybridized, a difference of a few bases in an optimal binding area did not affect the signal intensity . when probes were designed further apart along a transcript, the signal intensity was affected although it was still highly correlated . due to the in situ probe creation process, probes are high quality and the background signal is quite low. however, due to unused space, there were  <dig> probes that were replicated on the array . of the replicated probes with a significant hybridization, there was almost perfect correlation among these probes . array design is available at  accession number: a-mexp- <dig> 

dna hybridizations
to determine the overall effectiveness of the probes, dna was hybridized to the arrays. for six individuals, virtually all probes  had an intensity value significantly above background in all individuals. only two probes clearly did not hybridize as the signal from these probes was not significant in all but one individual. these two probes were designed from the same transcript, however two other transcripts from the same gene had significant signal intensities. five additional probes had 1- <dig> individuals that were not significantly above background. the hybridization signal intensity was quite high for many probes for the dna samples , and above the maximum detectable level for  <dig> probes. of these,  <dig> were saturated in all  <dig> arrays for the cy <dig> channel as cy <dig> gets saturated before cy <dig>  when the  <dig> saturated probes were removed, the pairwise correlations of signal intensity over all probes for the  <dig> individuals ranged from  <dig> - <dig> .

rna hybridizations
for liver tissue mrna,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  probes  had a signal intensity that was significantly above background for at least  <dig> out of  <dig> individuals. these probes represented  <dig>  genes . a more conservative threshold using probes flagged as "wellabovebg" was also applied to these data. with this threshold,  <dig>  probes  were considered significantly expressed in liver tissue. the proportion of significantly expressed genes is higher than observed in a study using a similar array system in mice, where  <dig>   <dig>  of the genes surveyed were considered "transcriptionally active"  <cit> . however, the lower proportion of genes expressed in the liver tissue of mice can likely be explained by the rigorous selection scheme employed by the authors to identify the "most transcriptionally active" genes. this difference also illustrates the idea that the suitability of certain probes for inclusion in a particular study will depend on the specific experimental question, and despite having a signal higher than the background, some probes may not be appropriate for some experiments due to their relatively low intensity.

the distribution of signal intensity for rna was much more varied than with dna and many more features had low signal intensity . this is expected since the copy number of the majority of genes in dna should be the same, and the signal intensity of dna hybridizations is based more on binding affinity and the size of the bound dna fragments since more label will be incorporated in larger fragments.

functional annotation
three-spine stickleback genes that exhibited a signal well above background   were examined for functional characterization. genes were initially matched to their putative human orthologs using biomart from ensembl . blast searches were also used to increase the annotation information. from biomart, a human uniprot accession number was obtained if possible to be used for functional characterization since the stickleback genes are not sufficiently annotated with regard to function. approximately  <dig>  genes  which had a significant intensity were not assigned a human uniprot accession number.

functional categories were assigned using go term mapper  and the human generic go slim categories. genes were placed into the "slimmed" categories for biological process , molecular function , and cellular component . there were  <dig> unannotated genes of the  <dig>  that had uniprot accession numbers.

the largest proportion of genes were involved in metabolism , binding , specifically protein binding  and catabolism . other than cell  and intracellular , organelles were the most represented category of the cellular component . these results are consistent with expectations as the liver plays an important role in metabolism, and these functions occur in organelles, mostly mitochondria.

as further evidence that the mrna expressed in this experiment are characteristic of liver tissue expression, we compared our results to the transcriptionally active genes from mouse liver tissue  <cit> . using go term mapper, the mouse  generic go slim, and the mouse gene symbols from the active genes, we obtained the proportion of genes in each of the go slim functional categories for mouse liver expression. from  <dig>  genes,  <dig> had ambiguous ids and  <dig>  were unannotated, leaving  <dig>  genes for functional annotation. the proportions of genes in each of the go slim categories were highly correlated between stickleback and mouse liver expression  .

CONCLUSIONS
the agilent gene expression array platform provides an extremely flexible custom array format for creating arrays for expression analysis. because of the in situ probe creation, there is low background which leads to a high degree of reproducibility between array batches. approximately  <dig>  probes, representing  <dig>  genes, are now available for use for transcriptomics studies of three-spine stickleback. probes can easily be added or removed from the current design to tailor the array to specific experiments as not all genes will be expressed in all tissues. additional flexibility lies in the ability to perform either one-color or two-color hybridizations. both types of hybridizations were used successfully in the testing of the arrays.
