BACKGROUND
campylobacter is a spiral gram-negative, thermophilic, obligate microaerobic bacterial genus that is ubiquitous in temperate environments  <cit> . campylobacter jejuni is recognized as the leading cause of bacterial food-borne and water-borne enteric diarrhea in humans. in the united states and great britain, more than 1% of the population is infected with c. jejuni each year  <cit> , and the incidence of c. jejuni-induced disease may be even higher in developing countries, where infection often goes unreported. the clinical symptoms of campylobacter infection include watery to bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea and vomiting in acute infection, even a severe inflammation of the intestinal mucosa with an influx of professional phagocytes  <cit> . mostly the infection of campylobacter is self-limiting, but some infections are associated with more serious medical sequels such as reiter's syndrome , miller-fisher syndrome  and guillain-barré syndrome   <cit> . the campylobacter-associated illness has become an economic and health burden in the world  <cit> . although knowledge about the organism and host responses to infection has been growing rapidly in the past decades, the pathogenesis of c. jejuni is not yet well understood.

c. jejuni colonizes the intestinal mucosa of warm-blooded hosts, including farm animals and humans. among these hosts the favored environment appears to be the intestines of avians, including chickens, that provide optimal temperature conditions for growth, e.g. 42°c. unlike in the colonization of humans, c. jejuni colonizes the intestinal tracts of most mammals and birds at a high level with little or no pathology  <cit> . the differences of pathology between human and chicken may relate partly to the host immune system. cytokines are central to the development of effective immunity against microbial pathogens. previous studies have shown that c. jejuni can invade human-derived epithelial cell cultures  <cit>  and induce the production of a number of cytokines and chemokines during the course of experimental infections  <cit> , as well as in clinical campylobacter infections  <cit> . in general, cytokine responses have mainly been monitored on human-derived cell lines with only a few studies performed on chicken cells  <cit>  and none involving c. jejuni isolates of chicken origin. furthermore, experimental colonization experiments have shown that passage through the chicken gut enhances the colonization potential and virulence of c. jejuni  <cit> , suggesting that it is important to use c. jejuni of chicken origin in order to more closely mimic the interactions taking place in the avian gut. therefore, we used primary chicken embryo intestinal cells  as a model to compare the cytokine responses of ceics elicited by c. jejuni strains of human and chicken origin, as well as the concomitant expression of the virulence-associated genes of c. jejuni.

RESULTS
intracellular bacterial counts
with the aim of determining whether c. jejuni is able to invade primary chicken embryo intestinal cells , intracellular bacterial counts were performed using the gentamicin protection method  <cit> . for this purpose two c. jejuni strains, a danish chicken isolate sc <dig> and a clinical human isolate hm <dig>  were investigated. prior to the infection experiment, the motility and morphology of both isolates was checked under light microscopy. the results of invasion are shown in figure  <dig>  the number of intracellular bacteria for both sc <dig> and hm <dig> were gradually increased from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i. and declined to a lower level at  <dig> h p.i. the percentage of internalized sc <dig> overall was lower than that of hm <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i., with the exception of the  <dig> h p.i. where the number of internalized sc <dig> was higher than that of hm <dig>  a statistically significant difference between sc <dig> and hm <dig> was observed only at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. .

production of cytokines by ceics
when human cells are in contact with c. jejuni a strong cytokine response is induced  <cit> . in order to determine if a similar response can be monitored with chicken embryo intestinal cells , the levels of il-1β, il- <dig>  cxcli <dig> , cxcli <dig>   <cit>  and tgf-β <dig> transcripts were measured in ceics at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. with c. jejuni strains sc <dig> and hm <dig>  mock-inoculated cells and those inoculated with lps  were used as controls throughout. figure  <dig> shows that both bacterial strains induced the production of il-1β, il- <dig>  cxcli <dig> and cxcli <dig>  but not of tgf-β <dig>  the level of il-1β, il- <dig> and cxcli <dig> transcripts increased gradually from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i. and declined slightly at  <dig> h p.i., whereas cxcli <dig> transcript increased steadily throughout the observation period and reached a high level at  <dig> h p.i. significant differences induced by sc <dig> and hm <dig> were observed only at some particular time points: il-1β at  <dig> h p.i. , il- <dig> at  <dig> p.i.  and  <dig> h p.i.  and cxcli <dig> at  <dig> h p.i.  and  <dig> h p.i.  while il- <dig> and il- <dig> transcripts were undetectable. the transcript of ifn-γ was detected only at some particular time points .

induction of inos and production of no by ceics
to study whether there are inflammatory responses in ceics, the cellular inos transcripts and the presence of no product in the medium were measured. the level of inos transcripts was altered by both strains and increased gradually from  <dig> to  <dig> h p.i., followed by a decline at  <dig> h p.i . the production of no from the inoculated ceics was determined at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. using the griess assay  <cit> . the results were presented as a net nitrite production over the background of the mock-inoculated ceics . nitric oxide was produced by inoculated ceics, while as expected, the ceics treated with lps also showed no induction.

expression of the virulence-associated genes of c. jejuni
to study whether the contact between c. jejuni and ceics induce bacterial virulence-associated genes, the expression of bacterial virulence-associated genes ciab, dnaj and racr was quantitatively determined during co-cultivation with ceics, relative to 16s rrna, and the fold change of the gene expression was determined relative to the mock-incubated bacteria in the absence of ceics. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  the transcription of the virulence-associcated genes was increased following co-cultivation with ceics, and the amount of present in the invaded/adhered bacteria was generally higher than that present in the suspended bacteria, especially the transcripts of dnaj and racr. ciab transcription was increased at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. in sc <dig> and hm <dig>  respectively, and declined to a background level at  <dig> h p.i., followed by a slight increase at  <dig> h p.i. in the suspended bacteria, the expression of ciab was changed slightly, increased in sc <dig> and decreased in hm <dig>  a significant difference between sc <dig> and hm <dig> was observed at  <dig> h p.i., where sc <dig> had a higher fold change than hm <dig> had . the transcripts of dnaj and racr in invaded/adhered bacteria were increased in both strains throughout the course of the experiment. a statistically significant difference was observed only for racr at  <dig> h p.i. , the level of racr and dnaj in sc <dig> was higher than that in hm <dig> with the exception of dnaj at  <dig> h p.i. in suspended bacteria, the expression of dnaj and racr was altered slightly during the inoculation. the racr transcript in sc <dig> was significantly higher than in hm <dig> at  <dig> h p.i. .

to examine whether the induction of the virulence-associated genes is contact dependent, the expression of the selected virulence-associated genes was also measured in the bacteria that had only been incubated with bacteria- and cell-free supernatant prepared from another co-cultivation experiments. the bacteria incubated with the medium from non-inoculated ceics and mock-incubated bacteria were used as controls. the level of expression of the virulence-associated genes in mock-incubated bacteria was defined as  <dig>  to which the expression of the genes in the bacteria incubated with bacteria- and cell-free supernatant and cultured medium was calculated . after  <dig> hours of incubation, expression of the three virulence-associated genes ciab, dnaj and racr of sc <dig> was increased slightly as compared to the mock-incubated bacteria and those bacteria incubated with the medium of non-inoculated ceics . the medium of non-inoculated ceics decreased the expression of ciab and dnaj in sc <dig> , but did not alter the level of racr transcripts. for hm <dig>  expression of the three genes showed a slight increase in both bacteria incubated with the medium of non-inoculated ceics and bacteria- and cell-free supernatant .

discussion
in this study, primary chicken embryo intestinal cells  were used to study the commensal interaction between chicken intestinal cells and c. jejuni of human and chicken origin. the results clearly show that both c. jejuni strains of chicken  and clinical  origin can invade ceics to a level approximate to that seen with human-derived cell lines  <cit> . however, hm <dig> demonstrated a higher percentage of internalized bacteria than sc <dig> at early stage after inoculation . the internalized bacteria did not persist, and declined to a low level at  <dig> h p.i.. these results are consistent with previous studies, in which only a few viable bacteria remained intracellularly in human dendritic cells  <cit>  and human peripheral monocytes/macrophages  <cit>  after a prolonged infection period  with c. jejuni. in contrast, other studies have demonstrated that c. jejuni may survive intracellular for relatively long periods of time in both phagocytes and intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> , and the phagocytosis may even promote the survival of c. jejuni  <cit> , which has lead to its suggested classification as a facultative intracellular pathogen. the intracellular survival may enhance the ability of c. jejuni to evade the host immune system, possibly favoring its long-term persistent infections  <cit> . however, to survive, the intracellular bacteria also have to overcome certain challenges, such as hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  and ferrous iron  <cit> . for c. jejuni and some other enteric pathogens, it is however still largely unclear as to which primary factor determines intracellular bacterial survival.

we further studied the interaction of c. jejuni-avian host in the aspect of the cytokine responses to c. jejuni. the results showed that both c. jejuni strains investigated were capable of inducing the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β and il- <dig> and the pro-inflammatory chemokines cxcli <dig> and cxcli <dig> in ceics. furthermore, we measured the production of inos and no from ceics. inducible nos was increased transcriptionally in ceics at  <dig> h p.i. , and an increased no level was also detected in the co-cultivated medium at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. . inducible nos, il-1β, il- <dig>  and cxcli <dig> are major markers of inflammatory disease. thus, it appears that c. jejuni can stimulate inflammatory responses in ceics. our results are consistent with previous reports using avian cells, in which campylobacter induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in avian primary chick kidney cells and the avian macrophage cell line hd <dig>  <cit> , as well as in primary intestinal chick cells  <cit> . interleukin- <dig> is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, a potent chemotactic factor for many immune effector cells, and a mediator of localized inflammatory responses  <cit> . campylobacter strains have exhibited variability in the induction of cxcl <dig>  and those strains with a high ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells frequently induce the high levels of cxcl <dig>  <cit> . although hm <dig> showed higher invasion efficiency than sc <dig> shortly after inoculation, we did not observe any convincing correlation linking the invasion efficiency to the induction of cytokines and chemokines. in addition, a previous study has demonstrated that the induction of cxcl <dig> from int <dig> cells may be regulated by two independent mechanisms, one of which requires adherence and/or invasion and the other requires cytolethal distending toxin   <cit> . the functional role of the avian cxcli <dig> measured in this study awaits further investigations.

potential virulence properties of campylobacter include motility, chemotaxis, colonization ability, adhesion to intestinal cells, invasion and epithelial translocation, intracellular survival, and formation of toxins and a number of putative virulence genes have been reported among the campylobacter isolates  <cit> . ciab gene and racr gene are highly prevalent in campylobacter isolates from various sources  <cit> , and conserved across the species  <cit> . dnaj is a functional homologue of the dnaj gene from e. coli and plays a role in c. jejuni thermotolerance and colonization of chickens  <cit> . the racr-racs  system is a two-component regulatory system and is involved in the ability to colonize the chicken intestinal tract  <cit> . it is important to study how these genes react to the co-cultivation as they could provide more information about campylobacter-host interaction and the pathogenesis of campylobacter. we thus measured the expression of these virulence-associated genes at the transcriptional level. all the three virulence-associated genes were up-regulated in invaded/adhered bacteria. the level of the expression in the suspended bacteria in contact with ceics was generally lower than that in the internalized/adhered bacteria, which is likely a consequence of less direct contact than experienced by the internalized/adhered bacteria. expression of ciab gene of the internalized/adhered bacteria was induced to a lower extent as compared to that of dnaj and racr . previously, in in vitro studies have shown that ciab is involved in the internalization of c. jejuni into host cells and required for the protein secretion process  <cit> . the up-regulation of the virulence-associated genes during the co-cultivation with and/or invasion into ceics may suggest that these genes play a role in the invasion process of c. jejuni. although few statistical differences were observed, sc <dig> showed in general a higher level of expression of these virulence-associated genes than observed in hm <dig> except with a few differences . shortly after inoculation , the invasion efficiency of sc <dig> was significantly lower than that of hm <dig>  it is likely that the virulence-associated genes in sc <dig> are more inducible by co-cultivation with ceics and this induction may decrease the invasion efficiency of sc <dig> 

to study whether the induction of the virulence-associated genes is contact dependent, the bacteria were incubated with the bacteria- and cell-free supernatant from another co-cultivation experiments and with the medium of non-inoculated ceics. the bacteria-and cell-free supernatant induced the expression of the genes tested to a greater extent in sc <dig>  than in hm <dig> . the medium of non-inoculated ceics suppressed the expression of the virulence-associated genes in chicken strain sc <dig>  especially for genes ciab and dnaj , while slightly increased in human strain hm <dig> . previous studies have showed that both host cell components and a cell-free serum-supplemented tissue culture medium can induce cia proteins secretion, and the secretion of c. jejuni cia proteins is contact dependent  <cit> . in our study, the results from sc <dig> may indicate that a physically contact of bacteria and ceics is not necessary for the transcriptional up-regulation of the genes tested, since the induction of the genes occurred in those bacteria inoculated only with bacteria- and cell-free media prepared from an another co-cultivation experiments. these results may indicate that ceics and/or bacteria secrete components into the environment after physical contact event. the secreted component may subsequently initiate the expression of the virulence-associated genes in other bacterium that had never been physically contacted with either ceics or invaded/adhered bacteria. thus, the up-regulation of these virulence-associated genes may not be bacteria-cell contact dependent, but the secretion of the active component is bacteria-cell contact dependent.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have demonstrated that both c. jejuni strains of human and chicken origin can invade ceics and stimulate ceics to undergo an inflammatory response in a similar manner. the expression of virulence-associated genes of c. jejuni is increased during the course of invasion, and may play a role in the invasion process.
