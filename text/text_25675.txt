BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is a frequent cause of gastroenteritis in humans  <cit> , including foodborne disease outbreaks  <cit> . a variant of s. typhimurium phage type dt <dig> - sometimes referred to locally as 135@ or 135a but without official phage type designation - is amongst the most common forms of s. typhimurium in australia  <cit>  and has been isolated from chickens and eggs in australia  <cit> . s. typhimurium phage type  <dig> and 135@ have been associated with multiple foodborne outbreaks in australia, which are generally epidemiologically linked to the consumption of eggs  <cit>  or chicken  <cit> .

in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> a series of seven outbreaks of s. typhimurium 135@ occurred in tasmania, australia  <cit> . these outbreaks involved  <dig> microbiologically confirmed cases of s. typhimurium 135@ infection, and were each linked to the consumption of raw egg-containing foods through epidemiological investigations conducted at the time  <cit> . for outbreaks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  s. typhimurium 135@ was isolated from a food source implicated during the investigation. while different raw egg-containing foods  and retail outlets  were implicated in the various outbreaks, each was traced back to eggs supplied from the same farm  <cit> . s. typhimurium 135@ was isolated from the farm in december  <dig> and january  <dig>  which subsequently ceased to operate.

the series of isolates collected during these outbreaks, linked to a single farm source, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the possible microevolution of a clinically important s. typhimurium clone in a natural but spatiotemporally contained bacterial population. in order to determine the unique features of s. typhimurium 135@, consider its microevolution and explore the utility of whole genome sequencing in understanding intermittent foodborne outbreaks, we sequenced  <dig> isolates associated with the tasmanian outbreaks and performed phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis.

RESULTS
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
twelve isolates were selected for sequencing based on their epidemiological link to the tasmanian outbreaks  and multi-locus vntr analysis  profiles, such that each outbreak was represented by at least one clinical isolate possessing the dominant mlva profile for the outbreak; linked food isolates were included where available for that outbreak; and sporadic isolates were those with the closest mlva profiles to the outbreak isolates. details of the twelve s. typhiumurium 135@ isolates, named stm <dig> to stm <dig> and sequenced via illumina hiseq, are given in table  <dig>  they include seven isolates from 2005/ <dig> ; two isolates from  <dig> ; and three isolates from the  <dig> outbreak . the genome assemblies were first reported in  <cit> . to investigate the relationships between the outbreak isolates, we mapped the sequenced reads to the reference chromosome sequence for s. typhiumurium strain sl <dig> . using the single nucleotide polymorphisms  identified from mapping, we inferred a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. we also included all publicly available s. typhimurium chromosome sequences, including dt <dig>  in the analysis for comparison . the tree  confirmed that sl <dig> was the closest finished reference to the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates, and therefore the most suitable reference for read mapping, snp calling and gene content comparison.

the phylogenetic tree  showed that the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates formed a clade that was closely related to sl <dig> and included a dt <dig> isolate. this clade  was separated from sl <dig> by just  <dig> snps. full details of the snps that varied within the 135@ clade are provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  ten of the 12 s. typhimurium 135@ isolates formed a tight clonal group, displaying ≤ <dig> snps between pairs of isolates . the branch leading to this clone was defined by  <dig> snps that the members of the clone share relative to all other s. typhimurium analysed . the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates outside this clone were stm <dig>  isolated during the fourth  <dig> outbreak and stm <dig>  isolated from a sporadic case between the  <dig> and  <dig> outbreaks. the publicly available dt <dig> genome, isolated from a human infection in the uk in  <dig>  <cit> , was equidistant from stm <dig>  stm <dig> and the s. typhimurium 135@ clonal group . interestingly, the publicly available dt <dig> genome, also isolated from a human infection in the uk in  <dig>  was not within the s. typhimurium 135@ group but clustered near the common ancestor of s. typhimurium 135@ and sl <dig> 

dissecting the series of outbreaks
figure  <dig> shows a detailed phylogeny for the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates, linked to a timeline depicting the size and timing of the series of outbreaks as first reported in  <cit> . s. typhimurium 135@ isolated from the same outbreak were near-identical to one another , but were differentiated from other outbreaks by > <dig> snps . the two isolates from the second  <dig> outbreak  shared  <dig> snps that were not detected in other isolates, and differed from one another at just one snp. stm <dig> was from a human case, and stm <dig> was isolated from a piping bag at the bakery to which the outbreak had been traced  <cit> . the genomic data therefore provides strong independent evidence that the bacteria isolated from the bakery and the human infection were linked by a short chain of transmission. similarly, the three isolates from the  <dig> outbreak  also clustered closely together, sharing  <dig> snps that were not detected in other isolates . this outbreak was traced to a restaurant  <cit> , from which stm <dig> was isolated from aioli . again the genomic data strongly supports the finding that raw egg-containing food at the restaurant was a source of transmission during the outbreak  <cit> .

the clonal group includes single representative cases from three other outbreaks, and two isolates from the farm to which all outbreaks have been linked . interestingly, while isolates from the same outbreak were nearly identical and shared ≥ <dig> snps differentiating them from other outbreaks, isolates from different outbreaks were roughly equidistant from each other and from farm isolates . this suggests that the clonal group to which all outbreak isolates belong  represents a broader population of s. typhimurium 135@ circulating at the farm, and that this population descends from a single ancestral strain introduced into the farm some time previously. as a corollary, the variation present within the outbreak clone therefore potentially represents the diversification of s. typhimurium 135@ through microevolutionary processes which occurred in situ at the farm, whose chicken population presumably provided a reservoir host for the bacteria. we therefore refer to this group, highlighted in red in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  as the “farm clone”.

dating the emergence of s. typhimurium 135@ and the farm clone
in order to estimate the likely date of emergence of the farm clone, we analysed the snp data using bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses . the maximum likelihood tree provided strong evidence for a constant accumulation of snps over time within the farm clone , with a substitution rate of 7 × 10- <dig> site-1 year- <dig> or  <dig> snps per chromosome per year. the bayesian and maximum likelihood methods gave similar results , supporting a substitution rate of 5-19 × 10- <dig> site-1 year- <dig> or 3– <dig> snps per year and indicating the most recent common ancestor  for the farm clone existed in 2003– <dig> . consistent with this, stm <dig> from the first outbreak in june  <dig> had acquired only two snps since the mrca, whereas the  <dig> isolates had acquired 14– <dig> snps since the mrca .

stm <dig> and stm <dig> were comparatively very distant from the farm clone, separated from it by 75– <dig> snps and sharing a much older mrca that diverged around 1996– <dig>  . this further supports that stm <dig> and stm <dig>  while certainly related to the farm clone, cannot be considered part of the same chains of transmission that caused the tasmanian outbreaks and did not derive from the s. typhimurium 135@ population circulating at the farm. consistent with this, stm <dig> and stm <dig> were isolated from sporadic cases of s. typhimurium 135@ in tasmania with no epidemiological links to the outbreaks, suggesting independent sources of s. typhimurium 135@ infection.

while we cannot validate the divergence date estimates with independent data, mlva analysis of our s. typhimurium 135@ collection showed isolates with mlva profiles identical to that of the outbreak clone  were detected in an australian chicken  and human infection  in  <dig>  this confirms the presence of the clone in australia in  <dig>  consistent with predicted introduction of the ancestor into the tasmanian chicken farm in 2003– <dig>  interestingly, closely related stm <dig> isolates  were collected during a tasmanian gastroenteritis outbreak in  <dig> and from a wild tasmanian devil in  <dig> .

microevolution and natural selection within s. typhimurium
our data set provides a unique opportunity to examine the microevolutionary processes occurring in the s. typhimurium population, within the spatiotemporal confines of a clonal bacterial population circulating in a host chicken population at a single farm over a 4–6 year period . we mapped each snp onto the phylogenetic tree  and determined its effect on encoded proteins , see additional file 1: table s <dig>  across all branches, the mean genome-wide rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions  was  <dig> . this is broadly indicative of purifying selection, suggesting that for every  <dig> non-synonymous snps that arise in the s. typhimurium population, one is deleterious and is removed. as this selective process is expected to take time, a decline in dn/ds is sometimes observed when moving from recent time scales  through to longer time scales   <cit> . because our data set includes isolates that are separated by varying amounts of evolution , we examined whether the dn/ds rate varied between branches associated with these different evolutionary scales. among branches separating diverse lineages of typhimurium , the average dn/ds was  <dig> . on branches separating the three clades of s. typhimurium 135@ , dn/ds values were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . across all snps accumulating within the farm clone , the dn/ds was  <dig> . hence there is no evidence that dn/ds declines through time in s. typhimurium; rather, non-synonymous mutations appear to either be removed rapidly  or become fixed within local subpopulations.

we have two outbreaks represented by multiple isolates, from which to examine the accumulation of snps during the course of an outbreak . we identified only  <dig> snps that arose during outbreaks;  <dig> of which were non-synonymous . this number is too small to draw conclusions from, but could be explained by underlying mutation rates without selection . for the other outbreaks, for which we have just one representative isolate each, it is impossible to distinguish snps that arose during the outbreak from those arising prior to the outbreak . stm <dig> and stm <dig> were isolated at the farm, therefore their differences from the mrca reflect mutations that have arisen during circulation within the farm. the snps they have accumulated since the mrca show a dn/ds of  <dig> , which is not significantly different from the average within the farm clone . there were also two internal branches within the clone that represent mutations arising in the farm; the branch leading to the second  <dig> outbreak  and the branch leading to the  <dig> outbreak . given the short time scale associated with these branches , the lack of non-synonymous snps is suggestive of strong purifying selection, which might be expected in a large bacterial population competing within a small, geographically confined host population such as a farm. however since no such paucity of non-synonymous snps was evident in the farm isolates stm <dig> and stm <dig>  and the mean dn/ds within the clone was the same as outside the clone, these low dn/ds values are probably anomalies and there is no evidence for significant difference in the short-term and long-term impacts of purifying selection within this s. typhimurium population.

phage content in s. typhimurium 135@
we also investigated differences in gene content in s. typhimurium 135@. there were very few differences in chromosomal gene content between s. typhimurium 135@ and sl <dig> . sl <dig> contains five prophage sequences as well as prophage remnants, which were mainly conserved in all s. typhimurium 135@ isolates . the p <dig> phage remnant of sl <dig>  was missing from s. typhimurium 135@, and the gifsy- <dig> phage of s. typhimurium 135@ is much closer to that of dt <dig> than sl <dig>  the major difference in phage content between sl <dig> and s. typhimurium 135@ was the replacement of sl1344’s sopeϕ prophage with a novel prophage we have designated p2-hawk . in sl <dig>  the p <dig> sopeϕ prophage is inserted in front of another prophage sequence, a  <dig> kbp p <dig> prophage located next to sl1344_ <dig> . the s. typhimurium 135@ chromosomes have the same p <dig> phage located at the same site, but in place of the  <dig> kbp sopeϕ prophage there is a novel p <dig> prophage  <dig> kbp in size . this p2-p <dig> phage region was completely conserved among all the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates . the novel p2-hawk phage in the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates carries two cargo genes – one is a hypothetical protein with no known function, however the second shares 70% amino acid sequence identity with a phage repressor protein  . nucleotide blast searches of the ncbi non-redundant database  identified prophage sequences with substantial sequence homology to p2-hawk in s. typhimurium t <dig> and in ten other s. enterica serovars  as well as s. enterica subspecies houtenae, often at other insertion sites in the chromosome. these other prophages however lack the two cargo genes. the phage content of the dt <dig> and dt <dig> genomes were very similar to s. typhimurium 135@ , except that they lacked a p <dig> phage near the p <dig> integration site  and dt <dig> harboured an additional p <dig> phage.

plasmid content in s. typhimurium 135@
all s. typhimurium 135@ isolates carried a copy of the s. typhimurium virulence plasmid pslt. we identified only two snps that separated the s. typhimurium 135@ plasmids from sl1344’s pslt  and a single snp that separated the plasmids of the outbreak clone from those of stm <dig> and stm <dig> . the stm <dig> and stm <dig> plasmids also harboured one unique snp each, both of which were non-synonymous . no differences in virulence plasmid gene content were identified, amongst the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates or in comparison with pslt.

two of the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates carried additional plasmids, both of the inci <dig> incompatibility group. stm <dig>  carried pstm <dig>  and stm <dig>  carried pstm <dig>  which included a sul <dig> gene that confers resistance to sulfonamide antimicrobials. plasmid pstm <dig> did not have any antimicrobial resistance genes but contained a  <dig>  kbp region which was not present in pstm <dig>  encoding adna adenine methytransferase , a dna damage inducible protein i  and several hypothetical proteins . this is consistent with antimicrobial susceptibility typing, which showed that all 12 s. typhimurium 135@ isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested with the exception of stm <dig> which was resistant to sulphathiazole. to determine whether pstm <dig> and pstm <dig> could be related via conjugal transfer between s. typhimurium 135@ host strains or via microevolution within the farm’s s. typhimurium 135@ population, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of the inci <dig> core genes for these and  <dig> publicly available inci <dig> plasmids . this analysis showed that pstm <dig> and pstm <dig> belong to a subclade including  <dig> other inci <dig> plasmids isolated from salmonella enterica, three of which were also associated with poultry . however the tree indicates pstm <dig> and pstm <dig> cannot be directly related to one another via transfer or local microevolution ; rather, they represent distinct transfers of inci <dig> plasmids into members of the s. typhimurium 135@ farm clone. this is also supported by plasmid mlst analysis , which shows pstm <dig>  and pstm <dig>  belong to different clonal complexes identified via analysis of much larger plasmid collections . interestingly stm <dig>  isolated from the restaurant to which the stm <dig> case was linked, did not carry an inci <dig> plasmid, nor did stm <dig> which was isolated from another human case from the same outbreak. hence plasmid pstm <dig> is likely to have been acquired in vivo during the infection in the human host rather than in the farm environment; this could potentially be related to selection for the sul <dig> resistance gene in pstm <dig> 

discussion
implications for understanding whole genome sequencing  data in the context of outbreak investigation and source attribution
it is important to note that both the epidemiological data and the phylogenetic approach are crucial for proper interpretation of the data. firstly, the epidemiological investigation was crucial in linking the infections to specific food sources and tracing these back to a single farm, with a high degree of confidence. this enables us to interpret the clonal group  as representing a diverse bacterial source population at the farm; without the epidemiological information and farm isolates we could only guess at a common source. secondly, phylogenetic inference is critical to reaching this understanding. if we were to consider only pairwise differences between isolates, we would be able to identify close relationships between isolates from the same outbreak  and conclude these form part of direct transmission chains; but we would not be able to resolve the nature of the relationships between different outbreaks or between farm isolates. however, the phylogenetic inference shows us that all the outbreaks and the farm isolates share a recent common ancestor, which enables us to understand that these isolates form a single local population resulting from just a few years of clonal expansion. other studies have also been able to demonstrate the benefits of using wgs and phylogenetic inference in addition to epidemiology in outbreak investigations, finding that wgs methods are stable and consistent with epidemiological results  <cit> .

our study provides insight into the level of diversity that can be expected during salmonella outbreaks. it highlights that when considering whether a specific food product, implicated by epidemiological investigation of outbreak cases, is in “immediate source” involved directly in disease transmission , we should expect very few mutations  between bacteria isolated from the proposed transmission vehicle and those from cases. however when tracing these food products back to a potential “ultimate source” , we must understand that we are likely to be sampling from a bacterial source population which has diversified to some extent, and that the transmission chain that led to human infections may represent just one sublineage of the overall diversity present in the ultimate source population. we therefore need to expect more variation between infection isolates and isolates from potential ultimate sources, without ruling out a direct transmission link. our data also suggests that, if multiple isolates are obtained from a suspected source population, there will likely be added value in generating wgs data on many or all of them rather than sequencing a representative isolate. even if no source isolates are identical to infection isolates, establishing the diversity range of possible ancestors of source and infection isolates will likely be informative, as it was in this case.

our data suggests that, as long as epidemiological and phylogenetic approaches were combined as they were here, most of the conclusions from this retrospective analysis could have been made during the outbreak investigation. if wgs had been performed prospectively during the outbreaks, it would have confirmed the existence of a close transmission chain between case  and food source  in outbreak  <dig> , and a close relationship between outbreaks  <dig> and  <dig> , see figure  <dig>  wgs would have confirmed immediately that stm <dig>  was not related to the contemporaneous outbreaks  <dig> and  <dig>  but that outbreak  <dig> probably was . when the farm isolates were obtained soon after, wgs would have confirmed that these also derived from the common ancestor of outbreaks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , lending further weight to the conclusions of the epidemiological investigation by providing strong phylogenetic evidence that outbreaks  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> stemmed from a common source population at the farm.

purifying selection within s. typhimurium
we found that genome-wide dn/ds was approximately  <dig>  across all branches of the s. typhimurium tree. this is consistent with a previous estimate based on comparison of two s. typhimurium lineages   <cit> . our observation that dn/ds rapidly reaches this level and then remains consistent across the phylogeny, is strikingly similar to the pattern observed in s. enterica serovar typhi, the agent of typhoid fever  <cit> . in s. typhi, dn/ds within wgs-defined subclones was roughly equal to one, reflecting the underlying mutation rates and an absence of purifying selection over short time scales; this is very similar to our observation that intra-outbreak snps in s. typhimurium were consistent with underlying mutation rates. similarly, in s. typhi snps that differentiated wgs-defined lineages  or occurred on the oldest internal branches of the wgs tree  showed a dn/ds  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . this suggests that in both s. typhi and s. typhimurium, approximately half of all non-synonymous snps are somewhat deleterious and removed rapidly from the population via purifying selection; however after this there is very little evidence of further selection. a recent study of s. enterica serovar agona found a similar dn/ds rate of  <dig> , and no evidence of adaptive selection within the s. agona population  <cit> .

substitution rates in s. typhimurium
we estimated a substitution rate of  <dig> -12 × 10- <dig> substitutions site-1 year- <dig> or 3– <dig> snps chromosome-1 year- <dig> among the s. typhimurium 135@ isolates. we did not perform this analysis for the whole s. typhimurium data set as there was no relationship between branch lengths and date of isolation across the rest of the tree. our rate is faster than that estimated within two lineages of s. typhimurium causing invasive typhoid-like disease in africa , which were calculated using methods similar to our whole-genome snp analysis with beast  <cit> . this may be because our analysis reflects short term evolution  in a small and spatiotemporally contained population , whereas the african population analysis reflects longer term evolution  in a larger host population. the recent s. agona population genomics analysis estimated a much lower substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10-8- <dig>  × 10- <dig> site-1 year- <dig>  however this analysis included multiple different lineages and displayed substantial variation in substitution rates across the phylogeny, hence it is not directly comparable  <cit> .

phage and plasmid variation
the genomes of s. typhimurium sl <dig> and s. typhimurium 135@ share a p <dig> prophage sequence, with different p <dig> prophages adjacent to it . a p <dig> prophage  exists at the same location in s. typhimurium lt <dig>  but no p <dig> phage is present. p <dig> is a defective phage that lacks its own genes for capsid, tail and lysis functions. instead it utilises p <dig> as a helper phage to build structural components and package its dna  <cit> . there is no evidence that physical proximity of the p <dig> and p <dig> prophages is important for this interaction, so the close physical link between p <dig> and p <dig> prophages at this locus in different s. typhimurium chromosomes may be related to preferred integration sites rather than the functional interaction between phages. sequenced s. tyhimurium isolates dt <dig>  dt <dig> and lt <dig>  <cit>  have the same p <dig> prophage as sl <dig> and s. typhimurium 135@, but without accompanying p <dig> prophage. the p <dig> phage in sl <dig> encodes sope, a type three secreted effector protein associated with host cell invasion. a recent screen of sl <dig> transposon mutants in mouse, chicken, calf and pig colonization models  <cit>  showed that sope mutants were attenuated in their ability to colonize the gut of chickens, calves and pigs . no data on sope mutants was obtained for the mouse infection model so the importance of sope in mammalian infection or gut colonization is unclear. however the ability of the sope-negative s. typhimurium 135@ to circulate in the chicken farm for many years, and to cause several large outbreaks of gastroenteritis in humans, indicates that it is not critical for colonization of chickens or for virulence in humans. this may be due to the redundancy of secreted effectors in the s. typhimurium genome - the sope <dig> protein, conserved in s. typhimurium 135@, is 70% identical at the amino acid level to the phage-encoded sope protein. the p2-hawk phage in s. typhimurium 135@ carried two cargo genes, which are not found in homologous phages in other s. enterica. one of these genes has close homology to a protein associated with conferring resistance to specific phages in lactococcus lactis <cit> . it is intriguing to speculate whether these genes may also confer resistance to certain salmonella phages, or even help the p2-hawk phage to repress the activity the p <dig> phage and prevent it from hijacking the p <dig> machinery to assist with its own dissemination.

the snps identified within the s. typhimurium virulence plasmid pslt were entirely compatible with the chromosomal snp phylogeny, indicating no evidence for transfer of the plasmid between members of the host bacterial population. the difference between and farm clone and sporadic isolates in the repeat copy numbers for the sttr <dig> vntr, located in the pslt plasmid, may be an indication that this vntr is relatively stable and further supports that the pslt plasmid is stable within the clone. the detection of two independent acquisitions of inci <dig> plasmids, pstm <dig> and pstm <dig>  in the s. typhimurium 135@ population is interesting. according to the inci <dig> plasmid mlst scheme, pstm <dig> and pstm <dig> belong to clonal complexes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. both are associated with s. enterica and e. coli isolated from humans, poultry and occasionally other food animals , and frequently carry beta-lactamase ctx-m genes, encoding resistance to third generation cephalosporins . the novel plasmids pstm <dig> and pstm <dig>  which lack ctx-m genes, may be useful comparators to investigate the emergence of ctx-m and other resistance genes in related inci <dig> plasmids.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that s. typhimurium 135@ is closely related to the well-studied laboratory strain sl <dig>  with very few differences in terms of snps or gene content. however we identified several minor phage differences which could account for the phenotypic differences in phage type, most notably the novel prophage p2-hawk replacing the sopeϕ prophage of sl <dig>  we also identified two novel inci <dig> plasmids in s. typhimurium 135@, which belong to plasmid lineages that are associated with enterobacteriaceae in poultry in many other parts of the world. by analysing the genomes of s. typhimurium 135@ from a series of outbreaks, we obtained estimates of short-term mutation rates and population structure in this important foodborne pathogen, which will be useful in interpreting genomic data in future outbreak investigations.
