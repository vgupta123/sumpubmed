BACKGROUND
phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, collectively called phosphoinositides, play essential roles in a wide range of cellular processes situated at intracellular membranes  <cit> . recent evidence indicates that phosphoinositides are not only short-lived signals that activate downstream regulatory networks, but also play constitutive roles in organelle identity and membrane dynamics  <cit> . a key property of individual phosphoinositides is their precisely regulated compartment-specific localization  <cit> . the control and maintenance of diverse intracellular phosphoinositide pools is achieved through the functional interplay of specific sets of lipid kinases and phosphatases. although it has been established that deficiencies in certain lipid phosphatases can lead to severe human disease  <cit> , it is unknown as to how the expression of these enzymes is regulated. in contrast, the transcriptional regulation of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of major membrane phospholipids is well characterized  <cit> . the cellular concentrations of metabolic intermediates required for phospholipid biosynthesis, such as inositol, choline and phosphatidic acid, determine the levels of expression of their respective biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> . however, whether the expression of lipid phosphatases and kinases is controlled by similar mechanisms remains unclear.

the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase sac1p is a major regulator of pip levels at the endoplasmic reticulum  and golgi  <cit> . the precise distribution of pip between these two organelles is critical for coordinating cell growth with the secretory pathway  <cit> . here we show that the cellular levels of yeast sac1p are regulated at the transcriptional level. we have identified a novel 9-bp element within the sac <dig> promoter region that is necessary for the regulation of promoter activity. furthermore, we demonstrate that intracellular levels of pip correlate with sac1p protein levels.

RESULTS
identification of promoter elements for regulation of sac <dig> expression
to identify the regulatory elements that are required for sac <dig> gene transcription in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, we generated a reporter construct to examine sac <dig> promoter activity. a genomic region comprising  <dig> bp upstream of the sac <dig> open reading frame  was fused to the gene encoding green fluorescent protein  . the activity of the sac <dig> 5'-utr was then determined by monitoring intracellular gfp levels . yeast cells in which the wild-type copy of sac <dig> was deleted, showed a five-fold elevated expression from the reporter construct . the phosphatase-deficient sac1- <dig> mutant caused a similar degree of upregulated sac1-gfp reporter activity , suggesting that the sac <dig> promoter is regulated by a mechanism that responds to a loss of sac1p enzyme activity. to identify essential elements within the sac <dig> 5'-utr, we constructed a series of truncations within this region and assayed promoter activity . elimination of a 150-bp fragment containing a putative tata box element  within the 5'-utr abolished expression , fig. 2a). further truncations led to the discovery of a 100-bp element directly upstream of the sac <dig> open reading frame that is necessary for promoter activity . significantly, the sac <dig> minimal promoter was not only essential for gene transcription, but also sufficient for producing an elevated expression response in a sac1Δ background .

to further investigate sac <dig> promoter elements, we constructed additional deletions within the sac <dig> 5'-utr and tested the individual deletion mutants in the gfp reporter expression assay . the deletion of base pairs from position - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in a significant loss of transcriptional activity, while removal of similar-sized fragments at either side of this region had no effect on promoter activity . two additional deletion mutations uncovered a region consisting of the 9-bp motif accagaggt ranging from position - <dig> to - <dig>  which is indispensable for expression . further analysis using the saccharomyces cerevisiae promoter database   <cit>  showed that this motif does not overlap with any known recognition site for dna-binding factors.

sac <dig> expression is regulated independent of inositol levels and er stress
deletion of sac <dig> causes specific changes in cellular phosphoinositide levels and induces characteristic cellular defects  <cit> . these in turn may indirectly affect sac <dig> expression. for example, sac <dig> mutants are inositol auxotrophs, characterized by their inability to grow on inositol-depleted culture medium  <cit> . changes in inositol concentrations modulate the expression of many phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> . this regulation involves binding of the transcription factor complex ino2p/ino4p to one or several uasino motifs in the promoter region of relevant genes  <cit> . although the sac <dig> region does not contain a canonical uasino motif, a negative regulation of sac <dig> expression by inositol would be consistent with the requirement of a functional sac1p for growth at low-inositol conditions. to examine whether sac <dig> promoter activity is regulated through inositol levels, we created a sac1Δopi1Δ double mutant. the opi <dig> gene encodes a negative regulator of inositol and phospholipid biosynthesis and represses activity of ino2/ino4-mediated transcription  <cit> . elimination of opi <dig> causes overproduction and excretion of inositol  <cit> . deletion of opi <dig> in a sac1Δ background rescued the growth defect on inositol-free medium  but continued to display other sac1Δ-specific phenotypes . however, expression of the gfp reporter from the sac <dig> region was not attenuated but enhanced in the sac1Δopi1Δ double mutant . yet, the elevated sac <dig> promoter activity in a sac1Δ background did not respond to increasing concentrations of inositol in the growth medium, ruling out the possibility that opi <dig> deficiency in a sac1Δ background simply stimulates sac <dig> expression by increasing the cellular inositol concentrations. the sac1Δopi1Δ double mutant showed also elevated gfp expression from the minimal sac <dig> promoter . because the sac <dig> region contains no uasino motif it remains unclear how opi <dig> deficiency further enhances the expression from this promoter. combined, these results suggest that inositol is not a regulator of sac <dig> expression.

sac1p plays an important role in er-function by promoting atp uptake and oligosaccharide biosynthesis  <cit> . disruption of sac <dig> induces er stress and causes constitutive activation of the unfolded protein response   <cit> . to test directly whether sac <dig> expression is controlled by the upr, we induced er stress by treating cells with the reducing agent dithiothreitol   <cit> . while dtt triggered a substantial increase in the cellular levels of the er chaperone kar2p , expression from the sac <dig> 5'-utr did not change significantly . this result eliminates the possibility that sac <dig> expression is under control of the upr. sac <dig> mutants also display defects in actin cytoskeletal arrangement and are sensitive to drugs such as caffeine and calcofluor white   <cit> . however, treating cells with cfw, an agent causing cell wall defects and thus activating the cell integrity pathway, had no obvious effect on sac <dig> expression .

intracellular levels of pip correlate with sac <dig> promoter activity
disruption of sac <dig> results in pleiotropic changes in cellular phosphoinositide levels. sac1Δ cells show a 2-fold elevation in pip levels and a moderate decrease in pip <dig>  <cit> . the most dramatic phenotype is an approximate 10-fold elevation in pip levels  <cit> . in proliferating cells, sac1p is required for confining a pip pool generated by the pi 4-kinase stt4p to the plasma membrane. during starvation, sac1p translocates from the er to the golgi and eliminates golgi pip, which is generated by the pi 4-kinase pik1p  <cit> . to examine whether the upregulated activity of the sac <dig> promoter responds to alterations in one of these pip pools, we introduced temperature-sensitive mutant alleles of stt <dig> and pik <dig> into a sac1Δ background. both pik1p and stt4p are essential for cell growth and it was shown previously that stt4ts or pik1ts strains show impaired pip biosynthesis and reduced viability at semi-permissive temperatures above 25°c  <cit> . in a sac1Δstt4ts strain cultivated at 33°c, the excess pip levels were largely reduced, whereas pip levels in the sac1Δpik1ts strain remained elevated at this temperature . these results are consistent with previous reports confirming that sac1p controls mainly stt4p-generated pip during normal cell growth  <cit> . as shown in fig. 5b, the relative activity of the sac <dig> 5'-utr correlates significantly with the respective changes in pip in these mutant strains. this result indicates that expression from the sac <dig> promoter responds to the levels of intracellular pip. to confirm that the pip-induced activity of the sac <dig> promoter is reflected by increased sac1p protein levels, we used the sac1- <dig> allele, encoding a phosphatase-deficient sac <dig> protein  <cit> . in wild-type cells a myc-tagged version of sac1-22p was expressed at the same level as sac1p. in contrast, expression in a sac1Δ strain induced a significant increase in myc-sac1-22p protein levels whereas protein levels of myc-tagged wild-type sac1p remained unchanged . in summary, these results indicate that sac1p protein levels respond to a rise in intracellular pip.

discussion
in yeast, many enzymes required for phospholipid biosynthesis show a common pattern of transcriptional regulation  <cit> . soluble and membrane-bound precursors for phospholipid biosynthesis such as inositol, choline and phosphatidic acid play a major role in this regulation  <cit> . in contrast, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of enzymes controlling the cellular levels of the phosphorylated derivatives of these phospholipids. while sac1p function is essential when yeast cells are deprived of inositol  <cit> , the expression of sac <dig> is not regulated by inositol itself. instead sac1p protein levels respond to the cellular levels of pip, which is the major substrate of this lipid phosphatase. pip is concentrated in distinct intracellular pools that have diverse yet essential cellular functions such as in regulating membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeletal organization  <cit> . in proliferating cells, sac1p is responsible for turning over the pip that is generated by the pi 4-kinase stt4p  <cit> . we find that alterations in this stt4p-specific pip pool are mechanistically linked to the control of sac <dig> expression.

membrane homeostasis and organellar traffic both rely on precisely regulated phosphoinositide gradients. in growing cells, sac1p plays an important role in preventing random equilibration of pip at intracellular membranes, a phenotype commonly observed in sac <dig> mutants  <cit> . linking sac <dig> expression to the levels of pip ensures that sufficient levels of the lipid phosphatase are continuously available to fulfill this task. analysis of promoter elements required for this regulation revealed the partially palindromic 9-bp motif in the 5'-utr of sac <dig> that is critical for expression. partial palindromic sequences have also been found in other cis-acting promoter elements  <cit> . however, queries in the saccharomyces cerevisiae promoter database  indicate that the accacaggt element does not overlap with any known consensus sequence for dna binding proteins and therefore represents a novel motif. sac <dig> promoters in higher eukaryotes have not yet been defined and it remains to be seen whether expression of the mammalian sac <dig> homologs is regulated via a similar element.

sac <dig> mutants display accumulation of pip at the nuclear envelope and it is possible that nuclear phosphoinositides activate or recruit hitherto uncharacterized factors required for transcription. recent reports indicated that phosphoinositides play important roles inside the nucleus and nuclear phosphoinositide-binding proteins have been discovered  <cit> . while our results support the idea that pip is a direct regulator of sac <dig> gene expression, it is also possible that a metabolite downstream of pip is the actual signal transducer. pip can be rapidly converted to pip <dig> by the pip kinase mss4p  <cit> . however, sac <dig> mutant strains do not show elevated pip <dig> levels  <cit>  and it is therefore unlikely that pip <dig> is directly involved in this regulation. another potential mechanism could involve soluble inositol phosphate species. both pip and pip <dig> can be hydrolyzed by phospholipase c giving rise to inositol- <dig> -bisphosphate and inositol- <dig> ,5-trisphosphate respectively  <cit> . these soluble signal transducers can be further phosphorylated in the nucleus where they are involved in transcriptional control and mrna export  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether these molecules play a role in regulating sac <dig> expression and identifying the additional components of this signaling mechanism awaits further investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
this study characterizes a promoter element required for regulated expression of the lipid phosphatase sac1p in yeast. this enzyme controls the distinct intracellular pools of pip required for membrane traffic and homeostasis. distinct from phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, whose expression is largely regulated by small soluble phospholipid precursors, the activity of the sac <dig> promoter correlates with the intracellular levels of pip. we propose that the precise control of sac <dig> protein levels by the membrane concentration of its major substrate ensures proper maintenance of organelle-specific phosphoinositide gradients.
