BACKGROUND
the end product of purine metabolism in humans and higher order primates is uric acid, which cannot be further broken down because of lack of uricase  <cit> . elevated serum uric acid  levels or hyperuricemia, a metabolic risk factor for gout and cardio-renal diseases, has been increasing in prevalence worldwide . as other cardiovascular and renal disease risk factors, hyperuricemia also has a strong genetic basis . sua is a complex trait, and its pattern of inheritance suggests that several genes may influence it. numerous genome-wide and candidate gene studies have found various genes, mostly uric acid transporters, to be significantly associated with sua in several populations, such as solute carrier protein  <dig> family, member  <dig>  , solute carrier protein  <dig> family, member  <dig> , solute carrier protein  <dig> family members  <dig> and  <dig> , solute carrier protein  <dig> family member  <dig>  and atp-binding cassette, subfamily g. member  <dig>  .

in a previous linkage study in  <dig> mexican americans of the san antonio family heart study, we found strong evidence of linkage for sua concentrations on 3p <dig>   <cit>  and suggestive evidence of association with the positional candidate gene contactin  <dig>   <cit> . other candidate genes in this region are inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor, type  <dig> , decapping mrna 1a ; transglutaminase  <dig>  and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor   <dig> . the one lod-confidence interval on 3p <dig> falls within the candidate region for 3p deletion syndrome whose features include developmental delays and mental retardation  <cit> . in particular, disruption of cntn <dig> and itpr <dig> seem to contribute to the 3p deletion syndrome phenotype and may have a causal relationship  <cit> . sua is also known as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, stroke, parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis .

given that we previously identified 3p <dig> quantitative trait locus  regulating sua concentrations, a detailed understanding of the genetic architecture of all candidate genes/variants within this 3p region and its association with sua is crucial. the aim of this study was to assess the association of variants in the chromosome 3p region in an expanded cohort of  <dig> mexican americans from the san antonio family heart study  and the san antonio family diabetes/gallbladder study .

RESULTS
the mean ± sd of age and sua levels of participating individuals  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/dl, respectively, with men having higher levels of sua than women  . significant heritability was detected for sua levels  with age, sex, and interaction between age and sex as covariates.table  <dig> descriptive characteristics and heritability estimates of serum uric acid

genetic analysis of expression levels of genes in the chromosome 3p region
as a next step, we performed genetic analysis to estimate heritabilities of gene expression of candidate genes in chromosome 3p <dig> region. significant heritabilities were observed for itpr <dig> . previously, transcriptomic analysis in safhs  <cit>  identified several cis-regulated transcripts including itpr <dig>  genome-wide association analysis provided evidence of association between itpr <dig> expression and itpr <dig> snps, and sodium channel, voltage gated, type viii alpha subunit  genes . in addition, itpr <dig> showed suggestive associations with snps in intergenic regions in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .table  <dig> genome-wide association of itpr <dig> transcript levels

discussion
our results demonstrate the importance of chromosome 3p <dig> genetic variants in the regulation of sua concentrations in mexican americans. we identified a qtl with significant evidence of linkage on chromosome  <dig>  for sua in an expanded cohort, confirming our previous linkage of a novel qtl on chromosome 3p <dig> affecting sua and better reflecting pedigree-specific effects. this region has been reported to harbor positional candidate genes with potential relevance to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome . cntn <dig>  a candidate gene in the linkage region of 3p <dig>  is a member of the contactin subgroup of cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin  superfamily and plays an important role in maintenance and plasticity of functional neuronal networks and central nervous system  development  <cit> . the variants in this gene are associated with developmental delays and mental retardation and may be relevant to autism-related spectrum disorders . disruption of cntn <dig> is also thought to cause cognitive defects  <cit> . our study showed strong association of sua concentrations with cntn <dig> snps. specifically, one cntn <dig> variant, rs <dig> is notable with a minor allele frequency  of  <dig>  %. although, sua has not been associated with autism or related disorders, it has been considered a biomarker for neurological disorders such as parkinson’s disease  <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit>  and alzheimer’s disease  <cit>  and cognitive defects  <cit> .

other genes in our qtl region, itpr <dig>  dcp1a and tgm <dig>  do not seem to have functional relevance to sua concentrations. however, all of these genes are located in or border the ~ <dig>  mb region which is associated with a syndrome known as 3p deletion syndrome. individuals with 3p deletion syndrome have a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, growth retardation and dysmorphic features  <cit> . itpr <dig> encodes an intracellular ip3-gated calcium channel involved in calcium signaling  <cit> . mutations in this gene have been associated with spinocerebellar ataxia  <cit>  and platelet signaling pathways  <cit> , and dcp1a is known to play a role in mrna decay and also in prematurely terminating protein synthesis  <cit> .

as described in the methods, the jla approach has the potential to amplify a signal taking into consideration random effects of shared sequence identity  and the fixed effects of marker genotypes , thus maximizing the information in a sample of related individuals  <cit> . with this approach, we had previously found common snps, maf > 5 %, in slc2a <dig> to be significantly associated with sua levels in mexican americans  <cit> . our jla approach also has the ability to detect rare variants which were primarily from the chromosome 3p <dig> region showing that rare or low frequency variants are more likely to be identified by linkage rather than association. of the top  <dig> significant snps,  <dig> of them had maf ≤ 5 %. family-based studies provide the best opportunity to identify these rare variants, with mendelian transmission from parent to offspring offering a chance to maximize copies of rare variants in the pedigree. this was supported by our analyses when we found that about six families contributed the most to the lod score . when we conducted the linkage analysis removing these families, the lod score was reduced to zero, whereas, linkage analysis in just these families increased the lod score to  <dig> .

the association between sua concentrations and variants in the chromosome 3p region has not been reported in any population except a study in an isolated population in europe. this study reported epistasis between slc2a <dig> and cntn <dig> suggesting a link between sua levels and autism-related spectrum disorder. purine metabolism disorders have been reported in autism spectrum disorders  <cit>  particularly hyperuricosuric autism. adenosine, a precursor of uric acid in purine metabolic pathway, is believed to be neuroprotective and known to promote sleep and reduce seizures  <cit>  indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for autism. lack of replication of the associations between sua and cntn <dig> or itpr <dig> snps by other studies is a limitation of the study. however, considering the role of purine metabolic disorders in autism, role for cntn <dig> and itpr <dig> in the regulation of sua seems plausible and needs to be evaluated further.

to gain further support for the association with the chromosome 3p <dig> region, we conducted jla of cis-regulated itpr <dig> transcript. our best associations of these transcript levels were with snps in itpr <dig> and scn8a genes. cis-regulated transcripts contain genetic variation within their gene and regulatory regions that affect their abundance  <cit> . the scn8a gene encodes a protein that is important for neuron hyperexcitability  <cit>  and mutations in this gene are known to cause cerebellar ataxia, which is the similar to that of itpr <dig>  given the importance of 3p region in neurological disorders and potential role of uric acid as biomarker for these disorders, this region assumes significance.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate the importance of variants in chromosome 3p <dig> region, particularly snps in itpr <dig> and cntn <dig>  in the regulation of sua concentrations in our cohort. the results of this study are very promising, though further work needs to be performed to validate them.
