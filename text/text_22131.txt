BACKGROUND
the ability to transfect dna into mammalian cells is vital in biomedical research, particularly in studies of mechanistic understanding and clinical application. in particular, functional analyses of proteins, their trafficking and localization, gene expression studies, tissue engineering and gene therapy frequently require introduction of plasmid dna into mammalian cells. some questions can be addressed using transformed cell lines but they are artificial models harbouring one or more oncogenic mutations that may have had widespread and poorly characterized effects on cellular biology, and reliance on their use alone can distort views of function and significance. in contrast, primary cultured cells are non-transformed and typically comprise a mixed population that is more representative of the cellular complexity of the tissue of origin. however, lipid-based methods commonly used to transfect transformed cells are generally ineffective with primary cells and achieving efficient transfection of primary cells is a common problem in biomedical research. the two major alternatives to lipid-based methods for introducing genes into cells are viral transduction and electroporation. although viral transduction can be effective, construction and handling of viral vectors and the processes involved in transduction are time consuming and require specialist expertise and, in cases of clinical application, safety issues can become paramount  <cit> . non-viral electroporation of genes into primary cells can provide a simple and efficient alternative but, typically, primary cells of different origins cannot necessarily be transfected using the same conditions, which then need to be optimized  <cit> .

growth of the skull vault occurs via a different process to that of long bone growth and less is known about the mechanisms involved. whereas growth of long bones occurs via a two step process  in which chondrogenesis precedes osteogenesis  <cit> , growth of the calvarial plates of the skull vault occurs via direct differentiation of mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells into bone-forming osteoblasts. this occurs at the fibrous suture located between calvaria and is known as intramembranous ossification  <cit> . premature bony fusion of cranial sutures results in craniosynostosis, a developmental disorder that affects one in  <dig> live births  <cit> , with dramatic consequences for affected children, including raised intracranial pressure, impaired vision and hearing, intellectual disability and psychological problems associated with different head shapes  <cit> . human primary calvarial suture mesenchymal cells derived from the bone forming regions between the skull calvarial plates can be used to study the molecular mechanisms involved in skull growth and the premature bony fusion that characterizes craniosynostosis  <cit>  in the pursuit of biologically-based, adjunctive therapies to minimize the need for recurrent surgical correction during early childhood development. however, lack of an efficient method for transfection limits progress towards this goal.

in this study we compared lipid-based and electroporation-based techniques to introduce genes into human primary calvarial suture mesenchymal cells and have shown that an optimized electroporation-based nucleofection technique provides the most effective and reliable transfection. we have conducted benchmark experiments to validate gene expression and study function using glypican  <dig>  a proteoglycan capable of regulating a variety of growth factors  <cit> , and to measure cell responses to two important bone growth factors, bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  and bmp <dig>  which have antagonistic roles in bone growth  <cit> .

RESULTS
transfection of human primary calvarial suture mesenchymal cells using the amaxa nucleofector- ii
initially, for transfection of human primary calvarial suture mesenchymal cells we tested several lipid-based, commercial transfection agents with a green fluorescent protein -containing expression construct, pmaxgfp . none of the transfection agents, except endofectine and metafectine, showed any significant cell death as observed by light microscopy but the percentage of gfp-positive cells determined by flow cytometry indicated that these agents produced only 1-4 % transfection efficiency . as a result of these very low transfection efficiencies, we tested electroporation-based methods using the neon transfection system and the amaxa nucleofector ii system. using the neon transfection system with human primary cranial suture mesenchymal cells, at best we achieved a transfection efficiency of 10 %  with recommended amounts of plasmid dna  and cells , and recommended optimization protocols that varied pulse voltage , pulse width  and pulse number . in contrast, with the amaxa cell line optimization nucleofector kit transfection efficiencies of 35–56 % were achieved using program t <dig> and nucleofector solution-v  and nucleofector solution-l ; however, cell survival was variable . to optimize transfection efficiencies and cell survival we tested several other nucleofector kits  which have been used to transfect primary cells from other tissues. we never achieved transfection efficiencies above 10 % using these kits . therefore, we optimized plasmid concentration and cell number using the t <dig> program and nucleofector solution-l, which had initially produced the highest transfection efficiency in the human primary suture cells. we tested  <dig>   <dig> and 9 μg of pmaxgfp per transfection and found that increasing amounts of plasmid resulted in lower cell survival . however, transfection efficiency was higher with more plasmid and the total number of transfected cells obtained with either  <dig> or 6 μg plasmid was similar. next, we investigated transfection efficiency and cell survival using increasing cell numbers in the transfection mix . increasing cell numbers resulted in lower cell survival but higher transfection efficiency. the highest relative numbers of living transfected cells were achieved with inputs of  <dig>  x  <dig> and  <dig> x  <dig> cells with 3 μg of plasmid. figure  <dig> shows gfp fluorescence in living, transfected cells.

validation of the nucleofection method demonstrates cellular responses to bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> in human primary calvarial suture mesenchymal cells
to demonstrate expression from other transfected plasmids and test functional responses in the cells, we first nucleofected a gpc <dig> expression vector into primary human calvarial suture mesenchymal cells using nucleofection. expression of the nucleofected gpc <dig> was confirmed by rt-pcr . next, cell function studies were conducted using the dual luciferase assay to test cell responses to two growth factor responsive luciferase reporter constructs, pid183-luc and p3tp-lux, responsive to bmp <dig>  <cit>  and bmp <dig>  <cit>  respectively. twenty-four hrs post-transfection of pid183-luc, bmp <dig> was added to transfected cells and luciferase activity of the bmp <dig> responsive construct was measured  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 48 hrs later. maximal induction  occurred 24 hrs post bmp <dig> treatment . to investigate responses to bmp <dig>  cells were transfected with p3tp-lux and 24 hrs later bmp <dig> was added, then luciferase activity was assayed a further 24 hrs later. a dose of 50 ng/ml of bmp <dig> produced a  <dig> fold induction in luciferase activity .

discussion
inefficient introduction of plasmid dna into primary cultures of mammalian cells is a common and frustrating problem in biomedical research that can restrict analyses of gene and protein function and limit progress in the understanding of human biology. human primary cranial suture mesenchymal cells are an heterogeneous cell population derived from the bone forming regions between the calvarial plates of the skull and are responsible for driving the rapid skull growth that occurs in utero and postnatally. there are reports describing gene expression profiles of human cranial sutures in normal development and in abnormal medical conditions such as premature bony suture fusion in craniosynostosis, but limited information about how suture cell functions are regulated and the molecular consequences of genetic mutations on them  <cit> . this fundamental information can typically be derived by in vitro manipulation of gene and protein expression in cell-based assays, approaches that require efficient, simple and reliable cell transfection methods to enable general implementation. lipid-based methods used to transfect plasmid dna into mammalian cell lines are generally not effective for primary cells, as our assessment of several widely used lipid reagents demonstrated, and alternate methods based on electroporation have been developed. since its first report 25 years ago by chu et al.  <cit> , electroporation of mammalian cells has been modified and developed as a commercially available technology for use in studying difficult to transfect cell types. however, primary cells of different origins respond differently, and methods need to be carefully optimized for each cell type. we evaluated two electroporation-based technologies, the neon transfection system based on methodological advances developed by kim et al.  <cit>  and the amaxa nucleofector ii system based on methodology developed by amaxa gmbh in  <dig>  using the neon transfection system with human primary cranial suture mesenchymal cells, at best we achieved a transfection efficiency of 10 %, much lower than other studies using this system with human stem cells from bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord blood, where transfection efficiencies of 35-80 % have been reported  <cit> . in contrast, with the amaxa nucleofector ii, transfection efficiencies of up to 90 % were attained, although cell survival varied with the transfection kits and programs tested. with optimization of transfection program, transfection solution, amount of plasmid dna and cell numbers, a protocol was developed that resulted in an average of 60 % transfection efficiency with 20 % cell survival. this transfection efficiency is comparable to that achieved in other primary cells and in stem cells using the amaxa nucleofector or other electroporators  <cit> . although mortality of the human primary suture mesenchymal cells is higher compared to other cell types, sufficient numbers of transfected cells can be obtained for quantitative-based assays of gene and protein function, as demonstrated using the dual luciferase assay.

bmp <dig> is the best known bone osteogenic factor and induces osteoblastic differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells  <cit> . in contrast, bmp <dig>  a less well known bmp, antagonizes bmp <dig> action by competing for binding to a common effector, smad <dig>  <cit> . loss of bmp <dig> results in excessive bone formation  <cit>  and recent data show bmp <dig> suppresses osteoblastic differentiation and thereby is thought to limit the differentiation of osteoprogenitors  <cit> . human primary suture cells have an osteoprogenitor-like phenotype and can be induced to differentiate with standard osteogenic supplements, ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate  <cit> . cranial sutures express bmp <dig>  <cit>  and bmp <dig>  <cit>  and we used nucleofection of human primary suture cells to measure bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> signalling with luciferase reporter plasmids and demonstrate robust responses of the cells to both bmps. it is possible that an interplay of these two bmps may occur in vivo to influence in cranial bone growth, in which case that could provide an opportunity to manipulate and alter the outcome of abnormal bone growth in conditions such as craniosynostosis.

CONCLUSIONS
a nucleofection protocol has been developed that provides a simple and efficient, non-viral alternative method for in vitro studies of gene and protein function in human skull growth. human primary suture mesenchymal cells exhibit robust responses to bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  and thus nucleofection can be a valuable method for studying the potential competing action of these two bone growth factors in a model system of cranial bone growth.
