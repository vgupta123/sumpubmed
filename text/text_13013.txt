BACKGROUND
a complex series of morphogenetic events and hemodynamic influences are required for cardiogenesis  <cit> . malformations of cardiac valves constitute the most prevalent form of human birth defects, appearing in nearly one percent of newborn infants  <cit> . the formation of cardiac valves requires two major consecutive steps: cardiac cushion formation and valve remodeling  <cit> . after cardiac looping, the cardiac cushions in the regions of the atrioventricular  canal and distal outflow tract  are formed through an endothelial-mesenchymal transformation , a remarkably complex event initiated by the specification and activation of a subset of endothelial cells in the cushion-forming regions. this event is followed by cell delamination from the endocardium and cell migration into the extracellular matrix between the endocardium and myocardium   <cit> . concomitant with migration into the cardiac jelly, the endothelial cells transdifferentiate into mesenchymal cells and proliferate to form multiple layers, resulting in the expansion of the cushion crests toward each other  <cit> . av cushion formation is followed by a series of morphogenetic events, including elongation, outgrowth and remodeling, which result in the conversion of the thick cushions into thin valve leaflets  <cit> . several signaling molecules have been implicated in regulating emt during cardiac valve formation, including the nuclear factor in activated t cells   <cit> , vascular endothelial growth factor   <cit> , and members of the epidermal growth factor   <cit> , bone morphogenetic protein   <cit> , notch  <cit> , transforming growth factor-β   <cit> , and wnt/β-catenin families  <cit> .

msx <dig> and msx <dig>  closely related members of the nk-family of homeobox transcription factors, have well-documented roles as both downstream effectors and upstream regulators of bmp signalling  <cit> . msx <dig> and msx <dig> function redundantly in multiple tissues and organs during vertebrate development, including the heart  <cit> . we showed previously that msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutants exhibit malalignment defects of the developing outflow tract including double outlet right ventricle and pulmonary atresia or stenosis  <cit> . these defects are associated with excessive proliferation of cardiac neural crest, endothelial and myocardial cells in the mutant outflow tract between e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> .

reduced expression of msx <dig> and msx <dig> was observed in the av cushions deficient in bmp signaling. such cushions also displayed immature cardiac jelly, compromised av myocardium and hypoplastic av valves  <cit> . however, no valve defects have been reported in mice deficient in either msx <dig> or msx <dig>  <cit> .

in the present study, we focused on av cushion and valve formation in mice with combined deficiencies of msx <dig> and msx <dig>  and compared marker gene expression in msx1-/-; msx2-/- double mutant av cushions with that in msx1-/- and msx2-/- single mutant av cushions. we observed hypoplastic av cushions and deformed av valves in msx1-/-; msx2-/- double mutants but not in msx1-/- or msx2-/- single mutants, and no discernable difference in the expression of av cushion markers between wild-type and single mutant mice. on the other hand, there was a reduced level of nfatc <dig> immunostaining in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av endocardium, and decreased expression of α-smooth muscle actin, notch <dig>  has <dig>  bmp2/ <dig> and pitx <dig> in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av cushion mesenchyme, indicating impaired emt and cushion formation  <cit> . in addition, perturbed expression of bmp2/ <dig>  tbx <dig>  anf, hand <dig> and hand <dig> in the msx1/ <dig> null mutant av myocardium suggests impaired myocardial patterning during chamber formation  <cit> . taken together, we conclude that msx <dig> and msx <dig> function redundantly in regulating the expression of genes required for av canal  morphogenesis.

RESULTS
hypoplastic av cushions and impaired endocardial signaling in msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant hearts
histological sections of hearts between e <dig>  and e <dig>  revealed atrial septal defect as well as deformed av cushions and valves in msx1-/-; msx2-/- double mutants , but not in msx1-/- or msx2-/- single mutants , nor in msx1-msx <dig> homozygous-heterozygous compound mutants . all eight msx1/ <dig> null mutants examined had hypoplastic av cushions and shorter but thickened av valves, indicating a failure to undergo proper valve outgrowth and remodeling .

to evaluate the functional redundancy of msx <dig> and msx <dig> in av cushion morphogenesis, we examined expression patterns of msx <dig> and msx <dig> in the av canal  between e <dig>  and e <dig> , while emt of the endocardial cushions was actively taking place  <cit> . at e <dig>  and e <dig> , msx <dig> and msx <dig> displayed overlapping expression in the endocardial and cushion mesenchymal cells, while msx <dig> was also expressed in the av myocardium, where no msx <dig> expression was detected . by e <dig> , msx <dig> expression extended to the lateral cushion mesenchyme adjacent to the av myocardium as well as the membranous parts of the interatrial and interventricular septa . our observations suggest that msx <dig> and msx <dig> may function redundantly during av endocardial emt and av cushion morphogenesis.

we then studied whether endocardial cell maturation and activation were perturbed in msx1/ <dig> double mutants. immunostaining for nfatc <dig> , which was previously shown to be upregulated in activated endothelial cells within the avc  <cit> , indicated that nfatc <dig> was present in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av endocardium at e <dig> , but with a significantly lower staining intensity compared to the control av endocardium . in contrast, the intensity of nfatc <dig> immunostaining in the oft endocardium was comparable between controls and msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutants . at the same developmental stage, the expression of notch <dig>  an essential inducer of emt  <cit> , was greatly diminished in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av cushions compared with the control . in contrast, notch <dig> expression in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant oft cushions was comparable with that in the control oft . on the other hand, the expression of another endocardial marker gene twist <dig> in msx1-/-; msx2-/- double mutants was comparable with that in control embryos .

we also analysed expression of has <dig>  which is the principle synthase of the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan   <cit> , in the av cushion mesenchyme of the msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutants. ha has been demonstrated to mediate endocardial cushion expansion by interacting with water and other extracellular matrix components to create a hydrated low-resistance macromolecular environment that promotes loss of cell contact inhibition and increased cell motility, which is a prerequisite of cardiac cushion expansion and subsequent emt  <cit> . our results indicated normal expression of has <dig> in spite of a greatly decreased number of has2-expressing cells in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av cushion mesenchyme . statistical analyses of multiple sections across the av cushions revealed that, in spite of normal cell proliferation and apoptosis, there was a significant reduction in the total number of mesenchymal cells in msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutants compared with their littermate controls . in addition, we found that there were only sparse mesenchymal cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin  in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av cushions, whereas the majority of mesenchymal cells in the control av cushions are α-sma-positive . as α-sma was previously shown to be a marker of emt  <cit> , our results further support impaired emt in the msx1/ <dig> null mutant av cushions, which may contribute to a decreased total number of cushion mesenchymal cells.

loss of function of both msx <dig> and msx <dig> perturbs myocardial signaling in the av canal
a variety of bmps , including bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  have been implicated in regulating emt during oft and av valve formation  <cit> . as msx <dig> and msx <dig> both have been shown to be upstream regulators of bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> during organogenesis  <cit> , we asked whether the emt-regulating bmp signals were deficient in msx1/ <dig> mutant av cushions. immunostaining for bmp2/ <dig> and phosphorylated smad1/5/ <dig> at e <dig>  and e <dig>  revealed significantly decreased bmp2/ <dig> signaling  in the av cushion mesenchyme of msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutants compared with their littermate controls . in addition to the av cushions, we also found decreased bmp2/ <dig> signaling in the atrial and ventricular myocardium of msx1/ <dig> double mutants . therefore, in contrast to the local upregulation of bmp2/ <dig> signaling in the msx1/ <dig> null mutant oft and pharyngeal mesoderm   <cit> , down-regulation of bmp2/ <dig> signaling in msx1/ <dig> double mutants is restricted to the av cushions and chamber myocardium.

previous studies have demonstrated that bmp <dig> induces tbx <dig>  expression in the av myocardium, which in turn inhibits the expression of chamber-specific genes including anf , chisel and cx <dig> in the avc, and thus establishes the identity of chamber myocardium  <cit> . to investigate whether reduced bmp2/ <dig> signaling in msx1/ <dig> mutant avc perturbed gene expression in the av myocardium, we compared expression of tbx <dig> and anf in controls and msx1/ <dig> double mutants. in msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutants, tbx <dig> expression was dramatically reduced in the av myocardium . this is a local down-regulation, as tbx <dig> expression in the pharyngeal mesoderm was comparable between controls and msx1/ <dig> double mutants . in agreement with decreased tbx <dig> expression, msx1/ <dig> double mutants displayed increased and ectopic expression of anf in the av myocardium . anf expression was also increased in the myocardium of the double mutant right ventricle .

in addition to tbx <dig>  other transcription factors that have been implicated in regulation of anf expression, including hand <dig>  <cit> , hand <dig>  <cit> , and pitx <dig>  <cit> , also exhibited dramatically reduced expression in msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant avc . hand <dig> is normally expressed in the left av myocardium  <cit> , but this was almost undetectable in msx1/ <dig> double mutants . in addition, hand <dig> expression was significantly decreased in the left ventricular myocardium of the msx1/ <dig> null mutants compared with the controls . similar to hand <dig>  there was an overall decrease of hand <dig> expression in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant myocardium . in fact, we have previously demonstrated reduced hand <dig> and hand <dig> expression in the msx1/ <dig> null mutant oft and secondary heart field, suggesting that hand <dig> and hand <dig> are target genes regulated by msx <dig> and msx <dig>  <cit> . we found that, in contrast to the control av cushions, where approximately 40–60% of mesenchymal cells expressed pitx <dig> , there were only sparse pitx2-expressing mesenchymal cells  in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av cushions . in addition, there was a substantial reduction of pitx <dig> immunostaining signal in the myocardium of the msx1/ <dig> double mutant left atrium shown in fig. 7b and 7f . multiple lines of evidence have shown that loss of hand <dig> or pitx <dig> expression in the avc cause av valve defects  <cit> . myocardium-specific deficiency of hand <dig> was shown to cause hyperplastic av cushions and thickened av valves  <cit> , implicating hand <dig> in post emt valve remodelling  <cit> . pitx <dig> may be required for both emt and post emt cushion morphogenesis, as pitx <dig> descendents were reported to be indispensable for late av cushion formation and av valve remodelling  <cit> .

discussion
previous studies have demonstrated that msx <dig> and msx <dig> are both expressed in the av endocardium, while msx <dig> is also expressed in the cushion mesenchyme and av myocardium  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated overlapping expression of msx <dig> and msx <dig> in not only the av endocardium but also the cushion mesenchyme . in support of the overlapping expression patterns, msx <dig> and msx <dig> exhibited redundant functions in the av endocardium and cushion mesenchyme during emt. we found that msx <dig> and msx <dig> function redundantly to upregulate nfatc <dig> expression in the av endocardium and maintain notch <dig> and bmp2/ <dig> expression in the av cushions during emt . previous studies demonstrated that nfatc <dig> signaling during valve morphogenesis is dispensable for emt  but is required for remodeling of the endocardial cushions into mature valve leaflets   <cit> . nfatc <dig> was found to regulate valve remodeling by transcriptional activation of matrix degrading enzymes including cathepsin k, whose substrates are collagen and elastin, via the rankl signaling pathway  <cit> . notch signaling in the av endocardium was reported to promote loss of cell-cell contact via down-regulation of endocardial ve-cadherin and induce emt via upregulation of myocardial tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . to initiate emt, bmp <dig> acts synergistically with tgf-βs to enhance the tgf-β-induced phenotypic changes associated with emt  <cit> .

we failed to detect any significant change of expression of twist <dig>  which has been implicated in down-regulation of e-cadherin and ve-cadherin during epithelial- or endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition  <cit> . it is likely that the expression levels of other transcription factors which also repress e-cadherin/ve-cadherin expression, including snail and slug  <cit> , are decreased in the msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant av endocardium. in fact, snail expression is activated by notch signaling  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the expression of snail and ve-cadherin are perturbed in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av endocardium.

in agreement with impaired emt, we observed significantly decreased total numbers of mesenchymal cells in the msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant av cushions . furthermore, only a small proportion of mesenchymal cells in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av cushions expressed α-sma, suggesting impaired differentiation during emt . on the other hand, both cell proliferation and cell survival were normal in msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant av cushions during emt .

interestingly, we found decreased bmp2/ <dig> signaling and expression of tbx <dig>  hand <dig> and hand <dig> in the msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant myocardium, including the av myocardium, which expresses msx <dig> but not msx <dig> in wild-type embryos, and the chamber myocardium, where neither msx <dig> nor msx <dig> is normally expressed. one possible explanation is that perturbed gene expression in the double mutant myocardium is a secondary effect of hemodynamic changes due to the absence of normal av cushions. reduced expression of both hand <dig> and hand <dig> in the msx1/ <dig> null mutant myocardium further supports our previous hypothesis that hand <dig> and hand <dig> are candidate target genes regulated by msx <dig> and msx <dig>  <cit> . decreased hand <dig> expression in the msx1/ <dig> double mutant av myocardium may be associated with defects in remodeling of the av cushions into mature valve leaflets, since myocardium-specific hand <dig> deficiency led to thickened av valves  <cit> , which were previously shown to be associated with impaired valve remodeling  <cit> .

it is noteworthy that, in contrary to decreased bmp2/ <dig> signaling in the msx1/ <dig> null mutant avc and chamber myocardium, our previous study demonstrated increased bmp2/ <dig> signaling in the double mutant oft myocardium and cushion mesenchyme  <cit> . it has been shown that bmp <dig> expression is normally switched from the oft myocardium to the avc and atrial myocardium between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> , suggesting that an alternative explanation for perturbed bmp signaling in msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant hearts is that bmp <dig> expression does not shift from the oft to the avc in the double mutants. locally reduced bmp <dig> expression in the msx1/ <dig> null mutant avc may be insufficient to maintain normal expression of tbx <dig> and in turn lead to reduced tbx <dig> and increased anf expression in the double mutant av myocardium   <cit> . perturbed bmp <dig> expression may also disrupt normal pitx <dig> expression in the msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant avc and atrial myocardium, as bmp <dig> has been shown to be a positive regulator of nodal signaling and pitx <dig>  <cit> . in addition, there may be altered expression patterns of other bmp molecules, including bmp <dig>  that contribute to the abnormal distribution of bmp signals in the msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant oft and av cushions. interestingly, bmp <dig> exhibits an asymmetric  expression in the oft myocardium at e <dig> , reminiscent of the expression pattern of pitx <dig>  <cit> . bmp <dig> expression undergoes a transition from the av cushion mesenchyme to the oft cushion mesenchyme between e <dig>  and e <dig> , indicating that it plays a critical role in both the emt of the av cushions and the development of the oft cushions  <cit> . further analyses of the expression patterns of the aforementioned bmp ligands will determine which bmp molecules are critical contributors to the impaired development of the msx1-/-; msx2-/- mutant oft and av cushions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we documented redundant functions of msx <dig> and msx <dig> genes in distinct aspects during av cushion morphogenesis: endocardial activation prior to emt , induction of emt , as well as post-emt valve remodelling .
