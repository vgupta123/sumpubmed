BACKGROUND
ageing can be described as a functional decline that leads to a diminished ability to respond to stress, increased homeostatic instability and an increased risk of diseases such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. ultimately, these changes lead to death  <cit> . the molecular basis of ageing is multifactorial, including changes in energy metabolism, alterations in dna repair mechanisms, increased inflammation and changes in leukocyte proportions . consequently, several theories exist regarding the mechanisms underlying ageing. whether the ageing process itself consists of the accumulation of molecular damage due to environmental and stochastic effects or is a truly programmed or pseudo-programmed process that stems from development remains to be determined, yet a process as complex as ageing most likely involves aspects of all these phenomena  <cit> .

ageing leads to both global and local changes in the dna methylation profile. global hypomethylation has been shown to occur across tissues, and promoter-specific hypermethylation has been demonstrated for various tissues and genes  <cit> . several ageing-relates diseases, such as cancer, alzheimer’s disease and type  <dig> diabetes, have also been shown to be associated with changes in dna methylation  <cit> . the role of epigenetics in ageing-associated processes could be significant, as genetics appears to explain only a small portion of the observed variation in lifespan and healthspan  <cit> . as the epigenome is modified throughout life by varying environmental conditions, the accumulated effects of these changes could be most prominent in the aged population.

dna methylation was suggested to control the activity of genes as early as  <dig>  <cit>  and has since been demonstrated to control the expression of single genes and the silencing of large sections of chromatin. dna methylation mainly occurs on cpg-dinucleotides, which form cpg islands containing above-average cpg content. these cpg islands overlap the transcription start sites  of the majority of human genes, and the classical role of dna methylation is transcriptional inhibition, with the methylation of tsss preventing the initiation of transcription  <cit> . the role of methylation in the gene body is less clear; methylation does not appear to block transcriptional elongation but may actually enhance it, and methylation may have a role in alternative splicing. furthermore, dna methylation is required for the suppression of transposable elements  <cit> . dna methylation controls gene expression by directly inhibiting the binding of transcription factors , by recruiting methyl-binding proteins that prevent tfs from binding to dna  <cit> , or by affecting the conformation of the surrounding chromatin  <cit> .

the relationship between ageing and dna methylation has been studied previously by measuring the dna methylation level of repetitive elements  as well as with illumina golden gate array  <cit>  and the infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip   <cit> . these arrays included a severely biased set of cpgs located in known cancer-associated genes and cpgs located almost exclusively in cpg island promoter regions, respectively. the illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip  offers an improvement in this area, as the probes span 99% of the refseq genes and are distributed more evenly across the genome, such as on the shores and shelves of cpg islands and in non-cpg islands , as well as in gene bodies and untranslated regions   <cit> . however, the majority of previous studies did not take into consideration the prominent ageing-associated changes in the proportions of leukocytes, thereby introducing possible bias into the analyses  <cit> .

in this study, our aim was to identify ageing-associated dna methylation changes that are independent of changes in leukocyte proportions. we also examined gene expression data from the same individuals from whom the methylation data were obtained, and we were therefore able to explore the relationship between gene expression and dna methylation in these elderly individuals.

RESULTS
ageing-associated dna methylation changes
our study population consisted of the vitality 90+ study population: there was a total of  <dig> nonagenarians and  <dig> young controls, from whom we extracted peripheral blood mononuclear cells . the methylation data were produced with the 450k array, and the expression data were obtained with the illumina humanht12v <dig> beadchip. our aim was to identify ageing-associated changes in the level of dna methylation. our approach was two-sided, as we sought to concentrate on cpg sites that showed a large enough difference in the level of methylation to have a plausible biological significance but also to ensure that the identified differences were not due to changes in the proportions of leukocyte populations.

the proportions of different leukocytes differed between the nonagenarians and young controls in our study population, as reported previously  <cit> . a principal component analysis  revealed that the first principal component accounted for  <dig> % of the observed variation in methylation levels detected in our data . this component was strongly associated with leukocyte proportions, indicating that the analysis needs to be adjusted for the proportions of leukocytes.figure  <dig>

first, we compared the methylation levels at individual cpgs in the nonagenarian group  with those in the young control group  using the wilcoxon rank-sum test and identified  <dig> cpg sites that were differentially methylated between these two groups . second, age group-associated methylation sites were identified with a beta regression model, with sex and different leukocyte populations  as covariates. this method identified  <dig> cpg sites for which age group was a significant covariate . the  <dig> cpg sites identified via the group comparison were enriched at the top of the list of the  <dig> ageing-associated cpgs. however,  <dig> of the  <dig> cpg sites showed no statistical significance in the regression analysis, indicating that the perceived difference in methylation was due to differences in leukocyte proportions rather than ageing per se. we now report the  <dig> cpg sites, which exhibit a large, statistically significant difference in the level of methylation between the nonagenarians and young controls and remain significant after adjusting for differences in leukocyte populations in the regression analysis, as truly ageing-associated methylation changes . sex chromosomes were excluded from the analysis.

among the  <dig> ageing-associated cpg sites,  <dig>  were hypermethylated, while  <dig>  were hypomethylated, in the nonagenarians. the most significant hits, based on the p-values obtained using the site-specific regression models, were cg <dig> , cg <dig> , cg <dig> , cg <dig> and cg <dig> . the largest differences in the level of methylation were observed for cg <dig> , cg <dig> and cg <dig> , which were hypomethylated in the nonagenarians, and for cg <dig>  cg <dig>  and cg <dig> , which were hypermethylated in the nonagenarians. the top-ranking hits are presented in tables  <dig>   <dig> and figure  <dig> table  <dig>

genomic location of the ageing-associated methylation sites
the ageing-associated cpgs were not uniformly distributed across chromosomes, cpg islands or genes. chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contained more ageing-associated methylation sites than expected, whereas chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had fewer ageing-associated methylation sites than expected . on the majority of these chromosomes, the proportion of hypermethylated sites compared with the proportion of hypomethylated sites was roughly equal or was slightly biased towards an excess of hypomethylated sites, as in the overall data. interestingly, on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  there were considerably more hypermethylated sites than expected: among the identified ageing-associated methylation sites on these chromosomes, 72% and 75% were hypermethylated, constituting a clear overrepresentation compared with the 46% of hypermethylated sites identified in the total data.

the cpg sites that were hypermethylated with advancing age were enriched at cpg islands, rather than on island shores or shelves or in non-cgis. by contrast, the hypomethylated cpg sites were enriched in non-cgis; their absence from cpg islands was striking, as only  <dig> % of all hypomethylated sites were located in cpg islands, whereas  <dig> % of the total probes were located in cpg islands . in regard to gene regions, hypermethylated cpgs were enriched in regions near the tsss and the 1st exons of genes, whereas hypomethylated sites were scarce in these areas and were enriched in the gene body and, more strongly, in the regions outside of genes .figure  <dig>

functional annotation of the ageing-associated methylation sites
the locations of ageing-associated hyper- and hypomethylation differ, thus it can be assumed that their origins and/or functions also differ. therefore, we performed the functional analyses separately for hypermethylated and hypomethylated sites and genes harbouring these ageing-associated methylation sites. the  <dig> hypermethylated sites were annotated to  <dig> different genes, and the  <dig> hypomethylated cpg sites were annotated to  <dig> different genes.

gorilla   <cit>  was used to identify the go functions and processes associated with ageing-associated hyper- and hypomethylation-associated genes. for both categories, we identified more significant go terms for hypermethylation-associated genes, even though there were fewer hypermethylation-associated genes compared with hypomethylation-associated genes. for the hypermethylation-associated genes,  <dig> enriched go function terms were identified , whereas for the hypomethylation-associated genes,  <dig> enriched go function terms were identified;  <dig> of these terms were common to the two groups . the top go function terms for the hypermethylation-associated genes were unique to these genes; these terms were associated with sequence-specific dna binding and transcription factor binding . the go terms that were enriched only for hypomethylated sites did not reveal similar enrichment for a common process . the go function terms that were common to hypermethylation- and hypomethylation-associated genes also formed a group and were clustered around channel function-associated go terms. the results for go process terms was similar to that for go functions, as we identified  <dig> significant go terms for hypermethylation-associated genes, whereas for hypomethylation-associated genes, we identified only  <dig> significant go terms;  <dig> of these terms were common to hyper- and hypomethylation-associated genes. . the top-ranking hypermethylation-specific go terms were clustered around two types of processes: development and morphogenesis; and metabolic processes, gene expression and nucleotide metabolism . again, the significant go terms associated with hypomethylation did not belong to a specific group . the hypermethylation-specific go terms that formed specific clusters are presented in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig>

effect of sex on ageing-associated dna methylation changes
among the  <dig> ageing-associated, high-confidence cpg sites, only  <dig> showed a statistically significant association with sex in our beta regression analysis in which age group, sex and leukocyte proportions were included as covariates. the sex-associated sites that were also ageing-associated are listed in additional file  <dig> 

association between ageing-associated dna methylation changes and gene expression
we performed a correlation analysis between the level of methylation at ageing-associated cpgs and the expression level of genes in which these cpg sites were located. in nonagenarians, we identified  <dig> correlation pairs  that consisted of  <dig> individual cpg sites and  <dig> individual genes . the apparent discrepancy in these numbers is because a single cpg can be located in a region of overlapping transcripts, and there can be several cpgs within the coding region of a single transcript. in the young controls, we identified  <dig> expression-methylation correlation pairs , consisting of  <dig> individual cpgs and  <dig> individual genes. in nonagenarians,  <dig>  of these correlated cpg-gene pairs showed an inverse correlation, and  <dig>  exhibited a direct correlation. in the young controls, these numbers were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. among the genes whose expression level was correlated with the level of dna methylation,  <dig> were common to the nonagenarians and young controls, and in all cases, the direction of correlation was the same. we previously showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes identified in the present study were differentially expressed with age in both sexes and that an additional  <dig> were differentially expressed with age in either sex  <cit>  .

the correlated cpgs did not exhibit a similar distribution in the genome to the ageing-associated methylation sites. those cpg sites whose methylation level correlated with the level of gene expression were concentrated in non-cgis and on cpg island shores and shelves, whereas only a few  were located in cpg islands. in the non-cgis, the majority of correlations were direct, whereas the opposite situation was observed in cpg islands and on island shores and shelves. with regard to regions within genes, the correlated cpgs were relatively evenly distributed. however, we identified an abundance of correlated cpgs within gene bodies , where the majority of sites were directly correlated. in regions near a tss , directly correlated cpgs were almost completely absent .

to analyse the processes associated with the genes that displayed a correlation between expression and methylation levels, we performed go term analysis and ipa for the nonagenarians. we identified  <dig> go process terms , of which  <dig>  were immune system associated. numerous immune system pathways were also identified when considering go process terms that were more loosely associated with these genes , where  <dig> of  <dig>  statistically significant go process terms were immune system associated . only one go function term  was associated with the correlated cpgs. in addition to the immune system, pathways related to the reaction to the environment were affected. ingenuity canonical pathway analysis revealed  <dig> canonical pathways  , the majority of which were directly immune system associated  or associated with cytoskeleton remodelling and endocytosis .table  <dig>

discussion
ageing-associated dna methylation changes; single cpg sites and their location and function
here, we present the results of our ageing-associated dna methylation analysis. in summary, our results were obtained with a 450k array using pbmcs collected from nonagenarians and young controls. the study subjects were analysed as two age groups, and we used two different statistical methods to verify that the ageing-associated methylation sites identified had a prominent difference in the level of methylation between the age groups and that this difference was not due to changes in leukocyte proportions. the proportions of leukocytes were measured via facs. we also added a layer of information by including gene expression data from the same individuals. the small number of young controls is a potential limitation in our study; thus, the results should be interpreted accordingly.

in previous ageing-methylation studies, the age range of the oldest study subjects has typically been from  <dig> to 80 years of age  <cit> , and the youngest age group to be included has ranged from new-borns  <cit>  to 50 years of age  <cit> . in studies in which subjects over 90 years old have been analysed, these individuals represented a minority of the study population or the overall sample size has been small  <cit> . hence, a strength of our study is the large number of the oldest-old individuals homogenous in terms of age. in addition, our study population represents the two extremities of adulthood, and as age was used as a dichotomous variable we were able to identify both changes occurring linearly with age as well as changes that occur in either end of the spectrum. the dna methylation studies performed with 27k arrays  <cit>  fail to capture methylation changes outside gene promoters, yet our results, as well as those of others  <cit> , show that ageing-associated changes are not restricted to gene promoters. in contrast to our study, previous reports combining methylation and expression data have relied on individuals from different study cohorts  <cit> . a group of studies have also tried to identify a small set of methylation sites that could be used to construct an ageing signature  <cit> . however, by focusing on a broader set of ageing-associated methylation sites, the mechanisms of ageing can be more thoroughly examined. given that published ageing-methylation studies have been conducted using various age ranges and statistical methods, discrepancies in the results are most likely due to both biological and statistical factors.

the main characteristics of the ageing-associated methylation sites identified in the present study are presented in table  <dig>  we identified  <dig> high-confidence cpg sites that show a large difference in methylation levels between nonagenarians and young controls and that present high statistical significance in a regression model adjusted for the leukocyte proportion. a slight majority  of the identified sites were hypomethylated in the nonagenarians. among the top-ranking ageing-associated methylation changes that have been reported with a high frequency, elovl <dig> , penk , fhl <dig>  edaradd , klf <dig>  and otud7a  were also identified in our study. of these genes, only edaradd was hypomethylated in the nonagenarians compared with the controls. as reported by steegenga et al.  <cit> , among  <dig> previous studies analysing the association of ageing and dna methylation changes in pbmcs  <cit> , only  <dig> probes were reported to be affected by age by more than one research group. of these probes, our analysis identified  <dig>  interestingly, the majority of frequently reported cpg sites are hypermethylated with increasing age. among the  <dig> cpg sites  reported to be associated with ageing by more than  <dig> groups  <cit> , 77% were hypermethylated. of the  <dig> cpg sites that are frequently reported and were identified in our study, 79%  were hypermethylated.table  <dig> 
characteristics of ageing-associated methylation sites


hypermethylated
hypomethylated
the cpg island location and genomic location refer to the sites where hyper- and hypomethylated sites are most abundant. notably, there are more hypomethylated cpg sites compared with hypermethylated cpg sites and therefore also more hypomethylation-associated genes, yet the hypermethylation-associated genes are enriched in more go terms and canonical pathways, and they share more common transcription factors.



the functional roles of the  <dig> most frequently reported ageing-associated methylation sites are currently unclear, as they are not associated with a common, ageing-related process. according to our results, the genes associated with these sites are not enriched under a common go term or in common canonical pathways. only fhl <dig>  penk and otud7a are included in any identified go term, and none of them are included in affected canonical pathways. the methylation levels of frequently reported cpgs are not correlated with the expression levels of the corresponding genes. for edaradd, we identified an additional cpg site  that was differentially methylated between nonagenarians and young controls, located within tss <dig>  where there is an inverse correlation between the methylation level and the expression level. however, based on previous findings and our results, it appears that the frequently reported ageing-associated cpg sites are not strongly associated with known ageing-related mechanisms but could instead represent a cellular chronological clock mechanism.

our results revealed an enrichment of ageing-associated hypermethylation at cpg islands, whereas hypomethylation was enriched in non-cgis and was almost totally absent from cpg islands. these findings are in line with previously reported results  <cit> . the majority of cpg sites are not initially methylated in cpg islands, and the change observed during ageing is hypermethylation. the opposite is true for regions with few cpg sites that initially are heavily methylated, and the non-cgis are associated with hypomethylation. these results support the notion that the normal maintenance of dna methylation patterns is disrupted with ageing  <cit> . as both hypomethylation and hypermethylation occur with ageing, it appears that both de novo methylation processes, mediated by dnmt3a and dnmt3b methyltransferases, and the maintenance of existing dna methylation, mediated by dnmt <dig>  are disrupted with ageing. interestingly, our results identified  <dig> cpg sites in dnmt3a that were ageing associated . however, there was no correlation between the level of methylation and dnmt3a expression.

our results showed that not only are ageing-associated hyper- and hypomethylation found at different genomic sites but that these changes are also found in genes associated with different functions. our findings further revealed that ageing-associated hypermethylation is concentrated in genes associated with developmental processes as well as dna-binding and transcription of genes, whereas hypomethylation is not enriched among a specific set of genes. johansson et al.  <cit> , rakyan et al.  <cit>  and florath et al.  <cit>  previously reported the association of hypermethylation with developmental processes and dna binding. as dna methylation regulates dna transcription, it is interesting that the genes required during this process are differentially methylated with ageing. in comparison with ageing-associated hypomethylation, hypermethylation appears to be a more regulated process, as no strongly hypomethylation-specific functions or processes were identified in this study.

it is notable that while the individual sites reported to be ageing associated differ to some extent between studies, the results regarding their locations in the genome and the molecular functions with which they are associated are more uniform. single highly significant cpg sites have also been reported in various studies, including sites located in the elovl <dig> and flh <dig> genes. common ageing-associated dna methylation changes can also be observed across different tissues  <cit> . thus, it appears that at least some fraction of ageing-associated dna methylation changes is caused by programmed or pseudo-programmed changes that occur in a similar manner across tissues and individuals. as certain processes and sites are reported frequently, it can be hypothesised that these sites and processes represent clock-like changes associated with ageing. for example, a strong association with chronological age has been shown for elovl <dig>   <cit> . however, it remains to be investigated whether these sites are only associated with chronological age or if there are also associations with phenotypic changes related to  ageing. if these frequently reported sites are only markers of chronological age, markers of biological age are yet to be identified.

the role of cell proportions in dna methylation studies
the majority of dna methylation and expression studies are performed with whole blood or pbmcs due to the accessibility of these tissue types. however, pbmcs consist of various cell types, and different individuals can exhibit differences in the proportions of different cell populations. ageing is known to be associated with changes in the proportions of t cells  <cit> . furthermore, the different leukocyte subtypes show differences in their dna methylation levels  <cit> , and changes in dna methylation are known to be one of the factors regulating lineage development in leukocytes  <cit> .

previous reports have claimed that differences in the proportions of leukocytes do not cause bias in methylation analyses  <cit> . however, contradictory reports have also been published  <cit> , and recently it has been systematically shown that differences in leukocyte proportions should be taken into consideration when analysing ageing-associated methylation differences  <cit> . our pca revealed that the largest percentage of the variation in our methylation data was associated with the proportions of different leukocyte subtypes .

the role of sex in ageing-associated dna methylation studies
according to our results, sex does not have a large effect on ageing-associated dna methylation changes in autosomes, as we identified only  <dig> cpg sites for which sex, in addition to age group, was a significant covariate in the regression model. however, the small number of male samples in our control population may have precluded the identification of ageing-associated sex differences. nevertheless, johansson et al.  <cit>  and mcclay et al.  <cit>  previously reported similar findings in studies focusing on individual sites associated with ageing. in studies where methylation profiles have been used to predict age, however, the methylome has been shown to age more rapidly in men than in women  <cit> . dna methylation is believed to mediate the long-term regulation of gene expression  <cit> , and it is therefore interesting to note that sex differences appear to be mediated via mechanisms other than dna methylation. apparently, the effects of sex observed in methylome studies predicting age are small global effects rather than large changes at a limited number of sites. we have previously reported  <cit>  that there are sex-specific differences in the gene expression changes associated with ageing, but based on the results of the present study, these expression differences are not regulated by dna methylation.

the role of zinc-associated proteins in ageing
we observed a clear enrichment of hypermethylation on chromosome  <dig>  which seems to be due to the abundance of zinc finger proteins on this chromosome. the increased methylation of zinc finger genes on chromosome  <dig> has previously been observed in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> , and similarities between the methylation changes that occur in ageing and cancer have been demonstrated in multiple studies  <cit> . it has recently been proposed that the zinc finger proteins on chromosome  <dig> have specifically evolved to repress endogenous retroviruses   <cit> . on the other hand, the expression of ervs has been associated with ageing in mice  <cit> . hence, the hypermethylation of zinc finger genes observed with ageing offers an explanation for why ervs are able to be expressed with advancing age. one of the zinc finger genes predicted to repress ervs by lukic et al.  <cit>  was znf <dig>  we identified  <dig> cpgs within this gene as being hypermethylated in the nonagenarians, and we identified a strong negative correlation between the level of methylation and the expression of this gene, indicating that its expression is truly downregulated in the aged individuals. both ageing and cancer are associated with genomic instability  <cit> , and the role of active ervs in inducing this genomic instability with increasing age could be analogous to that proposed in cancer  <cit> .

zinc-coordinating transcription factors were also enriched among the tfs predicted to regulate hypermethylation-associated genes in this study, as  <dig> out of the  <dig> identified tfs were zinc coordinating. zinc has been associated with various processes that are known to be regulated during ageing, such as immune function, dna repair mechanisms, cell proliferation, apoptosis and transcription  <cit> .

the association between ageing-associated dna methylation changes and gene expression
we sought to examine the relationship between ageing-associated dna methylation changes and gene expression levels. compared with previous studies, a key asset of our study is that methylation and gene expression data were available from the same samples. those ageing-associated methylation sites in which the level of methylation is associated with the level of gene expression are concentrated in non-cgis and on shores and shelves, as well as in gene body regions. similar findings have been reported by zilbauer et al.  <cit> . gene-body methylation has been proposed to affect gene expression via splicing and alternative start site usage  <cit> . it is important to note that many previous studies examining dna methylation changes during ageing have been performed using the illumina 27k array, where the majority of the probes are located in promoter regions. in these studies, the effects of gene-body methylation on gene expression levels remained unidentified.

the identified genes that display expression-methylation correlations are strongly enriched in immunological processes and in cytoskeletal remodelling and endocytosis. cytoskeletal remodelling is required for leukocyte activation, migration and phagocytosis  <cit> . the results imply that some fraction of ageing-associated immune system changes may be regulated by dna methylation. defects in the immune system are a hallmark of ageing, leading to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, cancer and ultimately death  <cit> . dna methylation typically regulates long-term trends in gene expression  <cit> , and the possibility that immune system-related processes may be locked in a particular state by dna methylation could offer one explanation as to why the immune system of elderly individuals is not able to respond appropriately to various insults.

we found that only a minority of ageing-associated cpg sites showed an association between methylation and expression levels. furthermore, only a minority of these genes have been identified as differentially expressed between nonagenarians and young individuals  <cit> . previous studies have also found a limited number of associations between ageing-associated dna methylation changes and gene expression levels  <cit> . due to the methods applied in the present study, not all the effects of dna methylation on gene expression could be detected; this limitation is also true for previously reported results. the textbook case of dna methylation regulating gene expression  remains undetected in many cases because in an array analysis, an unexpressed gene shows no signal that can be distinguished from background and is therefore typically omitted from the analysis. additionally, in the present study, the methylation level of each cpg was correlated separately with gene expression. in cpg island regions in particular, the effect of dna methylation changes on gene expression could be observed when a cluster of closely located cpg sites were analysed as a whole. the effects of cpg sites that are not located in the regulated gene itself also remain unidentified. the short list of methylation-gene expression associations linked to ageing reported herein and previously by others should be interpreted as a defined set of one type of methylation-gene expression associations, and it should be assumed that other types of mechanisms exist and require different methodologies to be identified.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the results presented here, it appears that ageing-associated hyper- and hypomethylation are distinct processes, both in terms of their causes and consequences. we suggest that hypermethylation is an active process, caused by programmed or pseudo-programmed ageing processes, and that hypermethylation is strongly associated with chronological age. ageing-associated hypomethylation, however, is a passive process caused by stochastic or environmental effects and is associated with biological age, i.e., the phenotype of the individual. whether the underlying cause of ageing is programmed, pseudo-programmed or due to the accumulation of molecular damage has been widely discussed in the literature. given that evidence supporting each theory can be found, it is plausible that these mechanisms all contribute to the ageing process but possibly affect different aspects  <cit> .

first, hypermethylation is an active process that consumes energy as new methyl groups are added to dna by dna methyltransferases. hypomethylation can also be an active process in some cases, but contrary to hypermethylation, it may occur passively as well  <cit> . the most frequently reported ageing-associated dna methylation changes  that are repeated across tissues and study populations, thus implying programmed changes, are hypermethylation events. in studies where chronological age has been explained in association with dna methylation levels, it has been found that at sites showing the strongest correlation with chronological age, methylation increases with age  <cit> . the ageing-associated hypermethylated sites form common groups with regard to cellular processes and functions. according to the results of the present study, hypermethylation-associated genes are predicted to be regulated by a common group of transcription factors and are also enriched in common go terms, whereas hypomethylation-associated genes do not to appear to form common groups. the top-ranking ageing-associated sites are hypermethylated, but hypomethylated sites are more numerous. this difference becomes more significant when the threshold of significance is lowered; of the  <dig> sites identified here, 54% were hypomethylated, but among the  <dig> sites identified with the regression model, 64% were hypomethylated. johansson et al.  <cit>  also reported an excess of hypomethylation over hypermethylation with ageing.

global hypomethylation has been associated with an increasing risk of frailty  <cit> , but very few other associations between phenotype and dna methylation have been reported  <cit> . however, this may be due to technical concerns, as the study by bell et al.  <cit>  was performed with the 27k array, which almost exclusively contains promoter-associated probes that are not methylated at baseline and can therefore primarily acquire hypermethylation. phenotype association studies performed with the 450k array or using sequencing techniques are necessary to clarify if hypomethylation is associated with typical ageing-associated phenotypes.

the role of dna methylation is known to differ depending on its location in the genome. thus, it would not be surprising if different dna methylation changes in the genome are affected by different ageing mechanisms. as dna methylation analyses are complicated by the different effects of methylation sites at different genomic positions and by the cumulative effects of nearby cpg sites, all possible known biases, such as the proportions of leukocytes, should be accounted for in dna methylation analyses.
