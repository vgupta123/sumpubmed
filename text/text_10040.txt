BACKGROUND
autotetraploid rice is a useful germplasm resource generated by colchicine-mediated chromosome doubling to achieve biological advantages over the diploid counterpart, such as strong hybrid vigor, higher resistance against the abiotic and biotic stresses, and the potential of the biomass production  <cit> . however, autotetraploid rice has poor seed set, which become the biggest bottleneck and the major barrier in commercial production  <cit> . partial pollen and embryo sac sterilities are the two important factors that lead to low seed set in autotetraploid rice .

abnormal chromosome behaviors and microsporogenesis were the main cytological reasons for low pollen fertility in autotetraploid rice  <cit> . moreover, we also found that abnormal microtubule organization also cause low fertility in autotetraploid rice  <cit> . recently, transcriptome analysis revealed that the differential expressions of the meiosis-related or meiosis stage-specific genes may disturb the chromosome behavior during pollen development of autotetraploid rice  <cit> . in addition to pollen, embryo sac development is also crucial for seed set, and some abnormalities, such as embryo sac degeneration, no egg cells and abnormal position and number of polar nuclei resulted in no embryo or endosperm formation in seeds of autotetraploid rice  <cit> . these findings indicated that abnormal embryo sac had a strong effect on the fertility of autotetraploid rice. recently, genome-wide gene expression profiles in ovules development have been reported and they found that dynamic gene expressions may play crucial roles during female gametogenesis in rice  <cit> . in addition, small rna sequencing showed that dynamic changes in the expression patterns of mirna and some specific differentially expressed mirnas may cause pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice  <cit> .

small rnas, the tiny size non-coding rnas, which are 19-25 nt in length, play major roles in many biological processes, including plant reproduction . the small rnas can be classified into two major types, one is microrna , and the other is small interfering rna . mirnas, as negative regulators, modulate plant gene expression by cleavage and decay of target transcripts involved in rice pollen development  and grain filling  <cit> . some novel mirnas have been reported to regulate the pollen and spikelet fertility, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . the mir <dig>  acts as the posttranscriptional factor, targeted the gamyb-like genes  and restricted the expression of these genes during anther development in arabidopsis  <cit> . mir <dig> is essential for anther and ovule fertility in arabidopsis, and the loss of mir <dig> expand the expression of arf <dig> and arf <dig>  and cause abnormalities during ovule and anther development  <cit> . furthermore, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are the most important mirna families involved in the generation of male-specific 21- and 24-nt phasirnas , respectively, and some studies suggest that they are essential for male meiosis and pollen development  <cit> . sirnas are produced from the transposable elements  and usually 24-nt in length that guide dna methylation and histone modifications for transcriptional gene silencing. transcriptome studies revealed that high expression of tes have harmful effects on the arabidopsis meiocytes  <cit> . additionally, the 24 nt-sirna abundance related to dna methylation of class ii transposable elements can suppress the expression of nearby genes in autotetraploid rice  <cit> .

although some information about the expression patterns of small rnas related with pollen development are available, the expression patterns of small rnas associated with embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice are still poorly understood. in the present study, we planned to investigate the expression levels of small rnas during embryo sac development compared to pollen development by using an autotetraploid rice, 02428-4x and its diploid counterpart,  <dig>  which is a famous diploid rice variety harboring s
5
n gene that can overcome the indica-japonica hybrid sterility. 02428-4x was developed from the chromosome doubling of  <dig> and was self-crossed for more than  <dig> generations at our farm. we sought to distinguish the small rnas changes in autotetraploid and diploid rice, and to determine the relationships between gene expression profiles and spikelet sterility.

RESULTS
cytological observations on pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice
the ploidy levels of autotetraploid rice, 02428-4x, was stable throughout the consecutive generations according to the chromosome observations . we found significant variations in morphological/agronomic traits of 02428-4x and 02428-2x . the seed set was significantly lower in 02428-4x than 02428-2x, with a marked difference of  <dig> %. 02428-4x also depicted poor pollen fertility  and embryo sac fertility  , which may be the major reason for low seed set.fig.  <dig> genetic variations in diploid and autotetraploid rice.  the diploid  and autotetraploid  rice.  grain length and width of 02428-2x and 02428-4x.  panicles of 02428-2x and 02428-4x




we-clsm  observation revealed that the stages of pollen development in autotetraploid rice were greatly in accordance with the sampling standards of diploid rice . the stages of pollen development were same in 02428-4x and 02428-2x, and they could be divided into eight different stages . however, many abnormalities , including degeneration of pollen mother cell  , multiple nucleoli , asynchronous division of pmc , abnormal spindle in dyad , abnormal tetrads  and abortive pollens at bi-cellular pollen stage , were observed in 02428-4x . in addition, abnormal chromosome behavior and chromosomal configurations were found during pmc meiosis of 02428-4x .fig.  <dig> abnormalities during pollen mother cell  meiosis in 02428-4x.  degeneration of pollen mother cells .  multiple nucleoli pmc .  asynchronous division of pmc , with one at metaphase ii and another at prophase ii.  abnormal spindle during formation of dyad, including ‘t’ type  and oblique type .  triad .  abnormal tetrad, green arrow shows the linear type and white one shows the ‘t’ type.  abnormal giant tetrad .  abortive pollens in bi-cellular pollen stage, with large and small pollen grains and spherical abortion type .  degeneration of meiocytes in tetrad  and early microspore stage . bars = 40 μm




moreover, we-clsm was also employed to observe the embryo sac development from the same spikelet. the embryo sac development stages were synchronous with the pollen development stages in diploid rice , namely pre-meiotic interphase, meiosis, single microspore stage and bi-cellular pollen stage were corresponding to the megasporocyte formation stage, megasporocyte meiosis stage, functional megaspore formation stage and eight-nucleate embryo sac developing-stage, respectively. similar to normal diploid rice, embryo sac development in the autotetraploid rice could be divided into eight development stages . different kinds of abnormalities were observed during the development of embryo sac in 02428-4x compared to 02428-2x. the main kinds of abnormalities were functional megaspores degeneration , abnormal mono-nucleate embryo sac , embryo sac degeneration , and abnormal polar nuclei in number and position . some double ovules with unsynchronized development were also observed in the autotetraploid rice .fig.  <dig> abnormalities during embryo sac development in 02428-4x.  functional megaspores degeneration .  abnormal mono-nucleate embryo sac .  embryo sac degeneration .  abnormal position and number of polar nuclei .  double ovules . bars = 40 μm




variations in mirnas expression profiles during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice
a total of eight mirna libraries of four pollen stages in anther, including pre-meiotic interphase , meiosis , single microspore stage  and bi-cellular pollen stage  and four corresponding stages of embryo sac development in ovary, including megasporocyte formation stage , megasporocyte meiosis stage , functional megaspore formation stage  and eight-nucleate embryo sac developing-stage , were prepared from autotetraploid and diploid  rice. principal component analysis showed that all libraries clustered into two groups, which related to pollen or embryo sac development, and each stage can be separated from pma to bcp/mf to ees . moreover,  <dig> mirnas were randomly selected for qpcr verification . the expression patterns of the  <dig> mirnas obtained through qpcr were largely consistent with the micrornaomes data. these results demonstrated the accuracy of samples used in the present study.

a total of  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas, were found in the present study . of these mirnas,  <dig> and  <dig> expressed during the development of pollen in diploid and autotetraploid rice, while  <dig> and  <dig> were associated with the development of embryo sac in diploid and autotetraploid rice, respectively . among the total mirnas,  <dig> mirnas  were specifically detected during the pollen development in autotetraploid rice , and  <dig> mirnas  were specifically related to the development of embryo sac in autotetraploid rice  .

we detected  <dig> dem  during pollen development in autotetraploid compared to diploid rice, which accounted for ~50% of the total detected mirnas. of these dem,  <dig>  were detected in pma,  <dig>  in ma,  <dig>  in scp and  <dig> mirnas  in bcp of autotetraploid compared to diploid rice . three dem, including pc-3p-199234_ <dig>  pc-3p-353219_ <dig> and pc-3p-46519_ <dig>  exhibited co-down-regulation in four pollen development stages, and osa-mir2275d were found to be down-regulated in pma, ma and scp but up-regulated in bcp .fig.  <dig> analysis of dem  in 02428-4x compared to 02428-2x during pollen and embryo sac development.  the number of dem at different pollen development stages  and embryo sac development stages  in 02428-4x;  venn analysis of dem during pollen  and embryo sac  development in 02428-4x. pma, ma, scp and bcp represent pre-meiotic interphase, meiosis and single microspore stage and bi-cellular pollen stage, respectively. mf, mm, fmf and ees represent megasporocyte formation stage, megasporocyte meiosis stage, functional megaspore formation stage and eight-nucleate embryo sac developing-stage, respectively

in total,  <dig> dem were found during embryo sac development of autotetraploid rice compared to diploid rice , including  <dig>  in mf,  <dig>  in mm,  <dig>  in fmf and  <dig>  in ees. interestingly, higher numbers of down-regulated mirnas were detected during pollen development, while up-regulated mirnas were more commonly found during embryo sac development. similar phenomenon was observed by venn analysis during embryo sac development, and the results showed that there was a great variation in number of dem during different embryo sac development stages, and the highest number of dem  was observed during mm . venn analysis revealed that only eight mirnas were co-up-regulated in each stage compared to diploid rice, including osa-mir1423-5p_l-2r +  <dig>  osa-mir1432-5p_r +  <dig>  osa-mir1862d, osa-mir2094-3p_l-1r +  <dig>  osa-mir5150-3p, osa-mir535-3p, pc-3p-115563_ <dig> and pc-3p-46519_ <dig> .

we further compared the dem between pollen and embryo sac development in each corresponding stage . in the first comparison , we found four dem co-up-regulated and one dem co-down-regulated in pma and mf of autotetraploid rice.  <dig> dem were found to be down-regulated in pma of autotetraploid rice, but up-regulated in mf. in the second comparison , two dem showed co-up-regulation and two dem exhibited co-down-regulation during ma and mm in autotetraploid rice, respectively.  <dig> dem showed opposite trends in autotetraploid rice, which were up-regulated in ma but down-regulated in mm  or down-regulated in ma but up-regulated in mm . in the third comparison , nine dem displayed co-up-regulation in scp and fmf of autotetraploid rice, but no co-down-regulated dem was observed. five dem were up-regulated in scp but down-regulated in fmf and nine dem were down-regulated in scp but up-regulated in fmf. in the fourth comparison , six co-up-regulated dem and three co-down-regulated dem were found in bcp and ees of autotetraploid rice, and six dem showed down-regulation in bcp, while up-regulation in ees. interestingly, higher number of dem was found in each corresponding pollen and embryo sac development stage than co-regulated dem . furthermore, we compared the detected mirnas between pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice. a total of  <dig> mirnas showed differential expression levels during the embryo sac development compared to pollen development , including  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> dem  in mf, mm, fmf and ees, respectively. interestingly,  <dig> dem were co-expressed during all pollen and embryo sac development stages , including  <dig> co-up- and  <dig> co-down-regulated during embryo sac development stages in autotetraploid rice, while these dem showed totally different expression levels during pollen development stages . therefore, we defined these dem as embryo sac-enriched mirnas , which was designated as dem-es, and pollen-enriched mirnas , which was designated as dem-p, in autotetraploid rice .

target prediction of dem and functional classification of pollen and embryo sac mother cell meiosis-related targets
to understand the genetic variations in autotetraploid rice during the pollen and embryo sac development, we predicted targets of  <dig> mirnas using the targetfinder, and  <dig> targets were found, with an average of  <dig>  targets per mirna . gene ontology  enrichment analyses showed that dem-p were significantly involved in flower development  and transcription factor activity , while cell differentiation , cell death , signal transduction  and nucleus  terms were detected by dem-es of autotetraploid rice . go analysis of the targets of dem at each stage in pollen and embryo sac development is shown in table  <dig>  the predicted targets were enriched in multicellular organismal development  and extracellular region  in ma during pollen development . however, primary metabolic process , signal transduction , nucleotide binding , kinase activity  and transcription factor activity  were preferentially enriched in mm during embryo sac development .

meiosis is a crucial process during pollen development. we analyzed the dem related to the meiosis of pollen development, and compared the target genes predicted by the dem at ma in autotetraploid rice with the transcriptome data reported for meiosis-related and stage-specific gene expressions in arabidopsis, diploid and autotetraploid rice . by using the predicted targets of the up-regulated mirnas in ma, we identified  <dig> dem associated with meiosis . two meiosis-related genes , and three meiosis specific genes that showed down-regulation in autotetraploid compared to the diploid rice during meiosis, including loc_os09g <dig> , loc_os06g <dig> , and loc_os04g <dig> , which annotated as ubiquitin fusion degradation protein, abc- <dig> type transporter domain containing protein and pb <dig> domain containing protein, respectively. another important gene, loc_os01g <dig> , which is required for pollen development and encodes myb family transcription factor, was also detected. some important genes, such as loc_os07g <dig> predicted by the osa-mir <dig>  and loc_os01g <dig> predicted by the osa-mir159a. <dig>  were found to be down-regulated during meiosis stage . moreover,  <dig> genes showed differential expression patterns in transcriptome sequencing, and the targets of up-regulated dem were similar to these  <dig> genes, such as loc_os03g <dig>  annotated as plastocyanin-like domain containing protein, loc_os08g <dig>  annotated as no apical meristem  protein and loc_os10g <dig>  annotated as universal stress protein domain containing protein . all the aforementioned targets may relate to abnormal meiosis of pmc.

the development process of embryo sac was different from pollen, especially after meiosis of the embryo sac mother cell ; therefore, the regulation mechanism of embryo sac development was also different from that in pollen. we compared the target genes predicted by the dem in mm associated with the embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice with the previously reported transcriptome data for megagametogenesis-related and stage-specific expression in diploid rice and arabidopsis , and  <dig> dem were found to be related to the development of embryo sac mother cell . among the up-regulated mirnas of mm in autotetraploid,  <dig> predicted targets were associated with the megasporocyte meiosis stage. two genes, loc_os06g <dig>  and loc_os12g <dig>  were associated with meiosis. loc_os06g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig> , annotated as minichromosome maintenance  family subunit  <dig> and abc transporter, were highly expressed in zygotene and pachytene of emc. nine genes showed the highest expression in tetrad, such as loc_os12g <dig>  which encoded kinesin motor domain containing protein  and loc_os06g <dig>  .

moreover, we used the targets of the dem in ma and mm to analyze protein-protein interaction networks. of these targets, eight genes associated with meiosis exhibited interactions with  <dig> targets, including loc_os09g <dig> , loc_os08g <dig>  and loc_os06g <dig> , identified by fujita et al.  <cit> , loc_os05g <dig>  and loc_os02g <dig>  identified by jin et al.  <cit> , loc_os01g <dig>  identified by aya et al.  <cit> , loc_os06g <dig>  identified by wang et al.  <cit>  and loc_os12g <dig>  found in oryzabase  . the dem detected in ma during pollen development was different from the embryo sac development, and these dem showed divergent expression patterns. osgamyb encoded by loc_os01g <dig> , revealed interaction with the genes encoding splicing factor 3b subunit  <dig> . cyca1; <dig>  interacted with the genes encoding myb family transcription factor and putative minichromosome maintenance  family subunit  <dig> . rpa2c  and rpa2b  encoded replication proteins, a2c and a2b, and showed interaction with loc_os06g <dig>  which further interacted with cyca1; <dig>  ostkpr <dig> , which was another target predicted by osa-mir159a-p <dig>  interacted with the mov <dig> family protein , sel <dig> repeat domain containing protein  and dnak family protein genes . the smc <dig> gene encoded recf/recn/smc n terminal domain containing protein , which interacted with loc_os05g <dig>  and loc_os08g <dig> . in addition, loc_os08g <dig>  encoded dihydroflavonol-4-reductase that interacted with abc- <dig> type transporter domain containing protein  and fg-gap repeat-containing protein . overall, complex protein-protein interaction networks were detected by the meiosis-related gene and meiosis-related dem.

the expression patterns of mir <dig> and mir <dig> families from pma to bcp in pollen and from mf to ees in embryo sac were nearly consistent in 02428-4x and 02428-2x, which specifically enriched during pollen development and gradually decreased after pma . six members of mir <dig> family showed differential expression patterns during pollen development . two of them, osa-mir2118d and osa-mir2118e-p <dig>  were found to be up-regulated in ma. beside, six members of mir <dig> also exhibited differential expression patterns in 02428-4x, including osa-mir2275d, osa-mir2275c-p <dig>  mes-mir <dig>  zma-mir2275a-3p_l- <dig>  zma-mir2275b-3p_1ss10ct and zma-mir2275b-3p_1ss22ag . interestingly, all these six mirnas of mir <dig> family were found to be down-regulated in ma of 02428-4x.fig.  <dig> the expression patterns of mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  families between 02428-4x and 02428-2x. pma, ma, scp and bcp represent pre-meiotic interphase, meiosis and single microspore stage and bi-cellular pollen stage, respectively. mf, mm, fmf and ees represent megasporocyte formation stage, megasporocyte meiosis stage, functional megaspore formation stage and eight-nucleate embryo sac developing-stage, respectively. “4x” and “2x” represent the autotetraploid and diploid rice, respectively

discussion
polyploidy associated mirnas expression patterns during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice
transcriptome analysis of rice ovules and anthers revealed that only  <dig> genes representing ovule-exclusive genes, compared to  <dig> anther-exclusive genes, and different go terms were found in ovules and anthers  <cit> . here, large numbers of mirnas were detected in pollen and embryo sac library and spatiotemporally dynamics during the pollen and embryo sac development. we found some mirnas were exclusive during the development of pollen or embryo sac and some were exclusive in autotetraploid/diploid rice; suggesting that mirnas expressed during pollen development were different from embryo sac development, and some mirnas changed after polyploidization. mircornaome analysis of different species of diploid and autotetraploid paulownia showed that up-regulated mirnas were more common than down-regulated mirnas in autotetraploid p. tomentosa, p. fortunei, and p. australis except in autotetraploid p. ‘yuza 1’ . in our study, the number of down-regulated dem was higher in pollen development of autotetraploid than diploid rice, whereas li et al.  <cit>  reported higher number of up-regulated dem in pollen development of another autotetraploid line than diploid counterpart. beside, differences between the pollen and embryo sac development in 02428-4x, up-regulated dem were enriched during embryo sac development, particularly at the meiosis stage. these studies on polyploid plants suggest greater diversity in mirnas expression patterns in different species. polyploidization always cause increase/decrease in expression patterns, gene loss and gene recombination in many plant species . higher missing rate of markers were detected in alfalfa  <cit> , great variations were found in mirnas  <cit> , and some differentially expressed mirnas were found to be associated with different ploidy rice  <cit> . here, multitudinous of exclusively dem detected in each stage during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice, and similar phenomena was found in taichung65-4x  <cit> , where mirna expression patterns changed dynamically in autotetraploid rice. these studies demonstrated huge changes in mirnas after polyploidization and polyploidy displayed the major impact on the mirnas expression pattern. taken together, a great diversity in the dem was exclusively documented in autotetraploid rice, and some co-expressed dem exhibited ploidy-related expression patterns, such as osa-mir2275d, probably played a key role, which may be associated with the pollen and embryo sac sterility in autotetraploid rice.

the contrasting expression patterns of meiosis-related dem during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice
transcriptome profiling is helpful tool for investigating the molecular characters of male and female gametophytes development in arabidopsis  <cit> . genome-wide gene expression profiles of ovules and anthers revealed that dynamic gene expressions play crucial roles during female and male gametogenesis in rice  <cit> . in the present work, the anthers/ovaries containing the developing male/female gametocytes at specific stages were observed, and identified the targets of dem associated with meiosis, which were similar to the genes detected by previous studies . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> dem associated with meiosis were detected in male and female gametophytes, respectively, and these dem showed huge differences between male and female meiosis, and probably played important roles during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice. the rest of the dem might be involved in various distinct processes that may also related to reproductive abnormalities in autotetraploid rice. moreover, some meiosis-related genes were highly expressed in meiosis of both male and female meiocytes, while some showed reverse expression patterns  <cit> . we identified some special dem associated with meiosis/meiosis-related genes by protein-protein interaction networks. all of these interactions suggest that the dem of ma and mm had a significant impact on the expressions of meiosis related or stage-specific genes. additionally, these dem showed opposite regulation between pollen and embryo sac, suggesting unsynchronized expression profiles in male and female gametophytes of autotetraploid rice. the regulation mechanisms of meiosis-related dem were quite different between male and female gametophytes.

earlier studies have shown that overexpression of mir <dig> inhibited mrna levels of myb family transcription factors leading to male sterility in arabidopsis  <cit> , and impairing the anthers development in rice  <cit> . in our study, osa-mir159a. <dig> targeted myb family transcription factor , which interacted with cyca1; <dig>  and displayed significant up-regulation in male meiosis but down-regulation in female meiosis. the increased expression of osa-mir <dig> during pollen development was consistent with a previous study on pollen sterile line  <cit> . we supposed that overexpression of osa-mir159a. <dig> in meiosis not only repressed the expression of myb family transcription factor, but also affected the meiosis-related genes, which cause meiosis abnormalities and hampered normal pollen development in autotetraploid rice. in addition, osa-mir159a-p <dig>  another member of osa-mir <dig>  targets loc_os09g <dig> , which displayed significant up-regulation in ma of autotetraploid rice. ubiquitin fusion degradation protein families were important in the process of meiosis, and ostkpr <dig> had reported to be associated with male sterility and pollen wall assembly  <cit> . highly-expressed osa-mir159a-p <dig> in ma may partially repressed the expression of loc_os09g <dig> and cause meiosis abnormalities in 02428-4x.


osa-mir1436_l + 3_1ss5ct, targeted mcm <dig>  which up-regulated in female meiosis of autotetraploid rice but down-regulated in male meiosis. protein-protein interaction showed that mcm <dig> have a relationship with rpa2c  and rpa2b, the genes related to meiosis. replication protein a  is a single-stranded dna binding protein that plays key role in dna metabolic pathways. incomplete meiotic chromosome fragmentation and synapsis were found in rpa <dig> mutant suggesting an essential role of rpa <dig> in dna replication  <cit> . additionally, recent research demonstrated a rice gene, osmsh4/ <dig> , which interacted with rpa complex and required for crossover formation during male and female gametes meiosis  <cit> . here, up-regulation of osa-mir1436_l + 3_1ss5ct and osa-mir167h-3p in female meiosis might be negatively correlated with the expression of mcm <dig> and rpa2c, which displayed interaction with dna replication genes, demonstrating that it may cause female meiosis abnormalities in autotetraploid rice.

down-regulation of 24 nt-phasirnas may cause abnormalities during meiosis in autotetraploid rice

mir <dig> and mir <dig> are required as triggers to initiate the 21 nt and 24 nt-phasirnas biogenesis, and have been reported in rice and maize anther development . mel <dig>  rice argonaute protein, selectively binds the 21nt-phasirnas to play an important role in meiosis and male fertility  <cit> . recently, zhai et al.  <cit>  analyzed the phasirnas of maize anther, and indicated that epidermis was necessary for producing 21 nt pre-meiotic phasirna, whereas tapetal layer was required for 24 nt meiotic phasirnas biogenesis; both of these phasirnas finally transport to meiotic cells and play their role in meiosis. our previous study depicted different levels of expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> families in taichung <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we found that mir <dig> and mir <dig> accumulated in pollen development and gradually declined from pre-meiotic, and 21 nt-phasirnas and 24 nt-phasirnas were also detected in the pollen development. the expression of mir <dig> was hardly detected during embryo sac development; however, 21 nt-phasirnas not only detected in pollen development but also in the embryo sac development, suggesting that the 21 nt-phasirnas was not the anthers specific phasirnas; probably synthesized in other tissues then transported to embryo sac. additionally, the irregular distribution of pollen-specific-21 nt-phasirnas in autotetraploid rice was different from the results of zhai et al.  <cit> , who indicated that the 21 nt-phasirnas accumulated and peaked at pre-meiotic in maize. the expression patterns of 21 nt-phasirnas were more complicated in autotetraploid rice and remained unknown. besides, the differentially expressed 24 nt-phasirnas were similar to the spatial-temporal expressions of mir2275d in 02428-4x pollen development. 24 nt-phasirnas were absent in the aberrant meiocytes of maize  <cit> . the down-regulated 24 nt-phasirnas and mir2275d were associated with the high frequency of cytological abnormalities in 02428-4x. we speculated that down-regulation of mir <dig> may result in the low expression of 24 nt-phasirnas, leading to the abnormal pollen mother cells development in autotetraploid rice.

24 nt tes-sirnas may cause genome instability and infertility in autotetraploid rice
the major function of 24 nt tes-sirnas was to maintain the genome integrity by silencing transposable elements. many transposable elements may activate in response to “genomic shock” by polyploidization of rice. in autotetraploid rice, dna methylation variation of transposable elements was found to play crucial role to adapt the whole-genome duplication  against the polyploidization  <cit> . most of the down-regulated 24 nt sirnas were associated with the accumulation of transcripts from dna tes in the mop <dig> mutant, which may relate with the loss of function of rna–dependent rna polymerase  <dig>   <cit> . here, we identified various kinds of 24 nt tes-sirnas associated with pollen and embryo sac development. in addition, the numbers of tes-sirnas were much higher during embryo sac development than pollen. the expression patterns of tes-sirnas were complex in different tissues of autotetraploid rice. moreover, we found that ~50% tes-sirnas were differentially expressed in autotetraploid rice during pollen development and more than 80% of the differentially expressed tes-sirnas showed down-regulation, which indicated that reduction of 24 nt tes-sirnas in pollen development of autotetraploid rice may induce genome instability and infertility during the pollen development. these results were consistent with the allopolyploid wheat and arabidopsis, where down-regulated tes-sirnas contribute to genome destabilization  <cit> . however, 24 nt tes-sirnas were found to be up-regulated in embryo sac development. there was a great variation in the activity of rna polymerase iv , dcl  and argonaute protein  in different development stage/tissue  <cit> , which resulted in differential expression patterns of tes-sirnas during pollen and embryo sac development. moreover, sirnas derived from transposable elements were similar to the nearby genes, which regulate the genes expression and play a crucial role in plant development  <cit> . many genes expression levels may change under the influence of tes-sirnas-triggered methylation, particularly at the crucial stages of female-meiosis, which explained more than 95% up-regulated tes-sirnas during the embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing to identify the small rna associated with the pollen and embryo sac development of autotetraploid and corresponding diploid rice. we identified  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas in autotetraploid and diploid rice, and  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas specifically expressed during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice, respectively. various dem were detected during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice. of these dem,  <dig> and  <dig> important dem were associated with male and female meiosis in autotetraploid rice, respectively. moreover, abundantly expressed 21- and 24-nt phasirnas exhibited differential expressions during pollen development, and 21-nt phasirnas were also detected during embryo sac development in the present study. interestingly, up-regulated 24-nt tes-sirnas were found to be dominant during the embryo sac development of autotetraploid rice, whereas a large proportion of down-regulated tes-sirnas were detected in pollen development. consequently, the significant differential expression profiles of small rnas in the autotetraploid rice may play important roles in regulating the development of pollen and embryo sac, thus resulting in low fertility and poor seed set in autotetraploid rice. our findings provide a new insight on small rna during pollen and embryo sac development in autotetraploid rice.
