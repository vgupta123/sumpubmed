BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  have been successfully isolated from bone marrow  <cit>  and adipose tissue  <cit>  in humans. mscs are multipotent and can differentiate not only into cells of the mesodermal lineage, such as osteoblasts  <cit> , chondrocytes  <cit> , and adipocytes  <cit> , but also into neurocytes  <cit>  and cardiomyocytes  <cit> . given the appropriate microenvironment, mscs can differentiate into various tissues. due to their accessibility, expandability, and multipotentiality, mscs hold promise for applications in regenerative medicine  <cit> .

mscs are defined by their plastic adherent growth and subsequent expansion under specific culture conditions and by their in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential  <cit> . induction of differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes under appropriate culture conditions has been extensively demonstrated  <cit> . however, msc cultures are composed of heterogeneous cell populations. the proportion of pluripotent stem cells in bone marrow-derived whole cell cultures ranged from 1/ <dig>  to 1/ <dig>   <cit> . the lack of common standards and precise definition of initial cell preparations remains a major obstacle in research on mscs and their application. current research aims to characterize mscs and to find ways of expanding msc cultures and maintaining the cells in the undifferentiated state  <cit> .

the expression profile of cell surface markers and mrnas is well characterized in other species. in many studies in humans and dogs cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> were regarded as positive cell-surface markers for mscs  <cit> , while cd <dig> and cd <dig> were regard as negative surface markers  <cit> . in addition, stage-specific embryonic antigen - <dig>  ssea- <dig>  ssea-4; the keratin sulfate-associated antigen tumor-related antigen -1- <dig>  and tra-1- <dig> were reported as markers of canine embryonic stem cells   <cit> . these molecules constitute a comprehensive set of unique stem cell markers. moreover, oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog were shown to be important transcription factors regulating esc self-renewal and differentiation  <cit> . these transcription factors interact with each other to oversee a vast regulatory network that maintains pluripotency and inhibited differentiation  <cit> .

in veterinary medicine, the use of mscs for tissue repair is helpful and is likely to increase in future. however, there have been few studies on cell surface markers and mrna expression profiles of canine mscs. here we evaluated the canine bm- and at-msc cell surface markers cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  ssea- <dig>  ssea- <dig>  ssea- <dig>  tra-1- <dig>  and tra-1- <dig> by flow cytometry. we also analyzed the mrna expression profile of oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog in canine bm- and at-mscs by quantitative real-time pcr . finally, we used immunocytochemistry to examine the expression and localization of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig>  the aim of this study was the biological characterization of canine mscs isolated from bone marrow and adipose tissue.

RESULTS
cell isolation and culture
adherent cells were observed at the bottom of the culture flasks within 2 days; these cells were isolated from both bone marrow and adipose tissue after plating. bone marrow-derived cells formed several colonies and proliferated, taking various shapes, including discoidal flat, triangular, and elongated . bone marrow-derived cells were uniformly distributed immediately after passage, but thereafter, gradually formed colonies and proliferated. unlike bone marrow-derived cells, adipose-derived cells were uniformly distributed and no colony formation was observed .

in vitro differentiation
osteogenic differentiation was demonstrated histochemically using von kossa stain . after adipogenic induction culture for 3 weeks, mscs showed an adipogenic phenotype. histochemical staining with oil red o was used to demonstrate adipogenic differentiation of mscs. lipid droplets were observed at about 14 days of culture in adipogenic medium and were positive for oil red o staining . both differentiation experiments were carried out in passage  <dig> .

characterization of surface markers for msc
cell surface antigen phenotyping was performed on bm- and at-mscs by flow cytometry  . bm-mscs and at-mscs revealed very similar expression patterns of surface markers. adhesion molecule protein cd <dig> , receptor molecule protein cd <dig> , and thy- <dig> cd <dig>  were expressed in both bm-mscs  and at-mscs . both types of cells also expressed cd <dig> , cd <dig>  .

canine mscs were analyzed by facs, as shown in figure <dig>  samples were scored as “−” if <9% of cells were positive, “+” if 9%–69% were positive, and “++” if ≥70% were positive.

hematopoietic markers cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  were detected in bm-mscs  and at-mscs .

bm-mscs  and at-mscs  expressed the embryonic stem cell-specific markers ssea- <dig> , ssea- <dig> , ssea- <dig> , tra-1- <dig> , and tra-1- <dig> .

mrna expression analysis using quantitative real-time pcr
expression levels of canine oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog mrna in bm- and at-mscs were examined by qrt-pcr . expression of oct3/ <dig> did not differ significantly difference between bm-mscs and at-mscs. however, sox <dig> expression tended to be higher in bm-mscs than in at-mscs while nanog expression in at-mscs was  <dig> -fold higher than in bm-mscs. .

immunocytochemistry
immunocytochemistry was used to analyze oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> proteins . in both bm-mscs and at-mscs, oct3/ <dig> was detected mainly the nuclei, whereas sox <dig> was detected in the cytoplasm.

discussion
in this study, we confirmed the potential of mscs to differentiate into osteoblasts or adipocytes, and evaluated the protein and mrna expression profiles of these cells. in addition, we compared the expression patterns of esc markers and germ layer markers in mscs derived from bone marrow and adipose tissue. bm-msc and at-msc populations expressed cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig> with similar intensity. in particular, in both bm- and at-mscs, more than 95% of the cell population expressed cd <dig> and cd <dig>  our results indicate that expression of cd <dig> was lower than that of other markers. however, many human studies have reported strong expression of cd <dig>  this may be related to differences within species. many human studies have reported positive expression of cd <dig> whereas many studies in mice have reported negative expression of cd <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the decline in cd <dig> expression may be influenced by the passage number of the cells. in early passage cells, cd <dig> showed variable expression  <cit> , and riekstina et al. reported that cd <dig> expression decreased with increasing passage number  <cit> . cd <dig> and cd <dig> markers are usually associated with hematopoietic stem cells.

the qrt-pcr analysis revealed expression of the stem cell markers oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog in canine bm- and at-mscs. in a human study, mrnas of these markers were expressed in human mscs  <cit> . these transcription factors mediate self-renewal and cell-fate specification and are downregulated when the cells are completely differentiated  <cit> . our results reflect their undifferentiated phenotype and high propensity for pluripotent differentiation and support the hypothesis that mscs may be pluripotent stem cells deposited in tissues during development. oct3/ <dig> mrna showed similar levels of expression in bm- and at-mscs. however, expression of sox <dig> in bm-mscs tended to be higher than in at-mscs. sox <dig> belongs to the sox subfamily, whose members are defined by the relationship of their hmg box  <cit> . in addition, sox <dig> regulates oct3/ <dig> expression and maintains esc pluripotency through upstream transcription factors  <cit>  and through cooperative binding of oct3/ <dig> to dna  <cit> . however, our results indicate oct3/ <dig> expression was similar in bm- and at-mscs, but sox <dig> expression slightly differed between the two cell types. this is probably due to the additional expression of other sox family members that act in a compensatory in mscs  <cit> . in addition, expression of nanog in at-mscs was  <dig> -fold higher than in bm-mscs. nanog is required to maintain the undifferentiated state and for the self-renewal of stem cells. in escs, knockout or knockdown of nanog abolishes both self-renewal and pluripotency, and results in differentiation of extraembryonic endoderm  <cit> . in a human study, comparison of proliferation in bm- and at-mscs revealed high proliferative ability in at-mscs  <cit> . these results suggest that at-mscs may maintain the undifferentiated state and that their self-renewal ability is greater than that of bm-mscs.

we performed immunostaining with oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> in mscs. in both bm- and at-mscs, oct3/ <dig> was detected in the nuclear fraction, whereas sox <dig> was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction. several transcription factors are known to be localized in the cytoplasmic fraction, such as the tead  <cit>  and foxo families  <cit> . these studies showed inhibitory activity of the transcription factors. hence it is possible that they inactivate sox <dig>  in addition, sox <dig> was localized in the nucleus in canine escs  <cit> . there are many functional differences between escs and mscs. for example, escs form teratomas in the testis, but mscs do not. we therefore suggest that restricted localization of sox <dig> protein may lead to lack of proliferation of mscs in vivo as well as maintenance of pluripotency of mscs in vitro.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals the protein and mrna expression profiles of canine bm- and at-mscs. the two types of cells showed similar cell surface marker profiles. quantitative real-time pcr revealed expression of mrnas for oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog in bm- and at-mscs. the localization of oct3/ <dig> and sox <dig> was demonstrated immunocytochemically. mrna expression of nanog was greater in at-mscs than in bm-mscs. further studies are required to characterize canine mscs with respect to the expression of other proteins and mrnas.
