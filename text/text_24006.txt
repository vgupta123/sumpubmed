BACKGROUND
small non-coding rnas  are important regulatory molecules that regulate the expression of target genes by affecting mrna stability, protein translation and chromosome modification. there are three main classes of small rnas: micrornas , small-interfering rnas  and piwi-interacting rnas . mature mirnas are a class of ~22nt small rna molecules that bind to complementary sequences in target genes and regulate gene expression by modulating mrna translation or stability  <cit> . mirnas have been implicated in many cellular processes, including immune mechanisms of biological molecules, stem cell differentiation, cell signal transduction, tumorigenesis, neuronal development and apoptosis  <cit> . sirnas are a class of double-stranded rna molecules between  <dig> and 25nt in length. they are involved in many pathways and regulate the expression of target genes via complementary binding sites  <cit> . sirnas are also known to play an important role in antiviral mechanisms and in shaping the chromatin structure of the genome  <cit> . recently, many endogenous sirnas were identified that function in transcriptional silencing  <cit> . pirnas are a class of small rnas associated with piwi family proteins. the biogenesis of pirnas is related to a process called the ping-pong cycle  <cit> . these small rnas have been found mainly in stem cells and germ cells, and they are thought to play an essential role in germline development, stem cell renewal, transposon silencing and epigenetic regulation  <cit> . due to the recent development and application of high-throughput sequencing, many novel small rnas have been identified, including trna-, rrna-, snorna- and snrna-derived small rnas  <cit> . trnas are not very stable and, under stress, can be sequence-specifically cleaved into different sized fragments termed "trna-derived fragments," "trfs" or "sitrnas." these fragments could be a novel class of small rnas. because they associate with the ago <dig> protein, it seems likely that they play a role similar to sirnas in rnai silencing  <cit> .

the silkworm, bombyx mori, is an important economic insect and has become a model organism for the study of the biochemistry, molecular genetics and genomics of lepidoptera insects  <cit> . previous studies on small ncrnas in the silkworm have focused on mirnas and pirnas. our group was the first to provide a large-scale identification of mirna genes in bombyx mori <cit> . recently, a large number of new mirnas have been identified using deep sequencing  <cit>  and their potential functions were predicted through an analysis of expression profiling performed at various developmental stages and in various tissues of the silkworm  <cit> . the mirbase database  has published  <dig> bombyx mirnas. pirnas have also been well characterized in the silkworm. kawaoka et al. analyzed the biogenesis of pirnas, which could exert an important genomic defense against transposons in the silkworm genome  <cit> . however, less work on sirnas in the silkworm has been performed, and only  <dig> potential transposable element -associated sirnas have been identified by deep sequencing techniques  <cit> . in addition, intermediated-sized ncrnas  have been systematic identified in the silkworm, including  <dig> snornas, six snrnas and  <dig> unclassified ncrnas  <cit> . based on the recent identification of an increasing number of small rnas, it seems likely that many novel small rnas remain to be discovered in bombyx mori.

to execute their functions, small rnas must be incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex . once incorporated, the small rnas guide risc to its complementary targets and thereby regulate the expression of the targets at the transcriptional or translational levels  <cit> . the argonaute  protein is a central protein component of risc and exerts specialized functions on the mirna and rnai pathway  <cit> . the mammalian argonaute family has four members, but only ago <dig> possesses slicer endonuclease activity  <cit> . the isolation of rnas associated with ago proteins has become an important means for the discovery and functional assessment of novel small rnas  <cit>  and for the target genes of mirnas  <cit> . bombyx mori argonaute <dig>  belongs to the ago family and is an ortholog of drosophila argonaute <dig>  which contains the conserved amino acid residues d <dig>  d <dig> and h <dig>  these conserved residues are critical for the nuclease activity of ago <dig>  previous reports have shown that in silkworm infected with bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus , bmago <dig> expression is up-regulated, which could be related to the rna silencing machinery involved in dna virus infection in insects  <cit> ; however, this mechanism will require further study.

ago proteins are key components of the sirna and mirna pathway and are indispensable binding proteins for the function of many other small rnas. therefore, the isolation of ago-associated small rnas is an important approach for identifying functional small rnas  <cit> . in this study, we extracted the total small rnas  that associated with bmago <dig> protein using the rna immunoprecipitation  method. subsequent deep sequencing, bioinformatics analysis and northern blotting were used to identify various types of small rnas associated with the bmago <dig> protein, including trna-, te-, rrna-, snorna- and snrna-derived small rnas as well as mirnas and pirnas. further analysis revealed that these small rnas possess novel characteristics.

RESULTS
rip of bmago <dig> from bmn cells infected with recombinant bmnpv virus
small rnas and their targets bind the ago-containing risc complexes, in which the ago proteins form stable ago ribonucleoproteins that can be biochemically analyzed  <cit> . the ago-protein-binding small rnas can be isolated by rip  <cit> . in a previous work, bmago <dig> was fused with a his tag and was successfully expressed using the baculovirus bacmid system harboring the ie <dig> promoter enhanced with a hr <dig> enhancer  <cit> . the recombinant viruses were then harvested at 20 hrs post infection, and his-bmago <dig> could be detected at a high level by western blotting with a his monoclonal antibody . the his monoclonal antibody  <dig>  roche) was used to immunoprecipitate his-bmago2-containing risc from the total cell lysate of the infected bmn cells. the approximately 120 kda his-bmago <dig> was identified by western blotting in the total cell lysate and his-bmago <dig> ip fraction but was absent in the ip fraction of the negative control . the co-immunoprecipitated bmago2-bound rnas were extracted and analyzed by page. interestingly, the rna collected via the his-bmago2-specific monoclonal antibody pull-down showed a much more dense rna smear than the total rnas of the bmn cells, ranging from 18 bp to 50 bp . in this region, three visible bands of ~20nt, ~27nt and ~33nt accumulated, indicating that small rnas may be recruited by the bmago <dig> complexes and may function together with the bmago <dig> protein. the negative control igg <dig> from the mouse did not immunoprecipitate visible amounts of rnas , indicating that the bmago2-associated rna signal was specific. taken together, our results demonstrate that bmago <dig> can bind many small rnas that can be biochemically isolated.

sequencing and analysis of a bmago2-associated small rna library
ago proteins have an important role in small rna pathways and mediate the interaction between small rnas and their targets. the resolution of ago-associated small rnas showed a significant landscape of ago proteins and their binding to small rnas  <cit> . to characterize the small rnas that associate with the bmago <dig> protein in bombyx mori, the small rna population associated with this protein in bmn cells was extracted from the ago immunoprecipitated complex. small rnas between 18nt and 50nt were separated by page and were then subjected to library construction and deep sequencing.

the high throughput sequencing yielded a total of  <dig>  unique reads, representing  <dig> , <dig> high-quality total reads of between  <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> copies. the reads were then mapped to the bombyx mori genome. of the  <dig>  unique reads, only  <dig>  mapped to the reference genome when mismatches were not allowed, accounting for  <dig> % of the total unique reads and showing no preference for the distribution between the chromosomes; however, when a maximum of two mismatches were allowed,  <dig>  unique reads mapped to the reference genome, accounting for  <dig> % of the total unique reads, suggesting that many mutations, base edits or snps exist in these small rnas . thus,  <dig> % of the total unique reads did not match the genome, which may also be due to possible gaps in the sequenced bombyx mori genome  <cit> . in addition, the reference genome was derived from male larvae and therefore did not contain sequences from the w chromosome  <cit> . the silkworm w chromosome was a source of small rnas in bombyx, such as the female-enriched pirnas  <cit> . of the  <dig>  unmapped unique reads,  <dig>  mapped to contig sequences from the w chromosome, which form a small portion of the whole w chromosome. additionally,  <dig> unique reads derived from the bmnpv genome were identified.

we investigated the length distribution of the obtained bmago2-associated small rnas. the reads showed a multimodal length distribution, with three peaks at ~20nt, ~27nt, and ~33nt . these sizes were consistent with the sizes of the bands separated by page . the length distribution of the bmago2-associated small rnas was different than that of the sjago2-associated small rnas, which showed only one peak at 21nt  <cit> . the number of 32nt and 33nt small rnas in the bmago2-associated total small rna population decreased significantly when the unique sequences were analyzed, but the number of ~20nt and ~27nt small rnas did not change much. this finding suggests that the bmago2-associated ~20nt and ~27nt small rnas comprised a large number of diversified sequences with low expression abundance, whereas the expression of the ~33nt small rnas occurred at an extremely high level . additionally, we observed a strong preference for the first 5′ nucleotide to be "u" in the unique bmago2-associated small rna sequences  and "a" was similarly enriched at position  <dig> , consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

the obtained small rnas were then classified and annotated using the bioinformatics pipeline described in the materials and methods. the results showed that "housekeeping" non-coding rnas, such as trnas, rrnas, snrnas and snornas, could produce bmago2-associated small rnas. thus, various types of small ncrnas were identified among the bmago2-associated small rnas, including te-, trna-, rrna-, snorna and snrna-derived small rnas as well as mirnas and pirnas . in addition, the  <dig> bmnpv-derived unique reads might be novel bmnpv-encoded small rna species. the unique small rna species were dominated by te-derived small rnas, which accounted for  <dig> % of the unique small rnas, but the total small rnas were overwhelmingly dominated by trfs, which accounted for  <dig> % of the unique small rnas and  <dig> % of the total small rnas. we also identified many small rnas without clear structural features or functions, which we defined as unannotated small rnas. the unannotated small rnas comprised a large number of diverse sequences with low expression and accounted for  <dig> % of the unique small rnas and  <dig> % of the total small rnas.

trfs
with the development of molecular cloning for the identification of cellular rna fragments and deep sequencing, a number of classes of small rnas have been identified recently, including a novel class of small rnas in eukaryotes. this group of molecules, termed trfs, comprises rna fragments derived from either trnas or trna precursors  <cit> . trfs were the most abundant small rna identified from the deep sequencing of the bmago2-associated small rnas, accounting for  <dig> % of the total small rnas. however, trfs accounted for only  <dig> % of the unique small rnas, implying that an extremely high abundance but a low species number of trfs are recruited by the bmago <dig> protein .

to further confirm the expression of the trfs and to determine their size, we used northern blotting to analyze the selected trfs. the trfs with read copy numbers of no less than  <dig> and redundancy removal were selected. in addition, the other selected trfs were derived from the same host trna that generate the previously selected trfs. our results showed that bombyx trnas could generate small rnas, which were derived mainly from the 5′ or 3′ termini of the trna . there were two types of 5′trf molecules. one was a ~33nt 5′trf, which was located at the 5′ termini of the host, trna and produced via cleavage of the anti-codon loop by a certain nuclease . the other was a truncated 18nt 5′trf molecule, which was produced by further cleavage of the ~33nt 5′trf at the d loop; this 5′trf molecule could not be detected using northern blotting but could be sequenced at a high read copy number . the 3′trfs also comprised two types of molecules. one was an ~40nt small rna that was located at the 3′ termini of the host trna and was produced through the cleavage of the anti-codon loop . the second was a 21nt 3′trailer trf small rna located between the anti-codon and tψc loop of the host trna  that was produced by further cleaving the ~40nt 3′trf at the tψc loop. the 3′trailer trf could not be detected using northern blotting but could be sequenced with a very high read number . a gttc motif appeared in the 3′termini of the 21nt 3′trailer trfs due to a conserved cleavage site at the end of the gttc motif in the tψc loop . the asymmetric source of trfs from the trnas showed that the trfs are not random by-products of trna biogenesis and degradation but are instead an abundant and novel class of small rnas.

interestingly, bombyx trfs seem to play a prominent role in the response of bombyx mori to bmnpv. many trfs showed very high expression levels in the bmnpv-infected bmn cells . among these trfs, some exhibited obviously up-regulated expression in the bmnpv-infected bmn cells, while others were expressed only in the bmnpv-infected bmn cells . these results suggest that the trfs are important stress factors and might have an important function during baculovirus infection. importantly, almost all of the detected 5′trfs were expressed in only the infected bmn cells; thus these trfs are most likely produced under the stress of viral infection. the levels of the corresponding trnas were not increased in the infected cells, indicating that it is the processing to trfs that is changed in the infected cells. surprisingly, the ~33nt 5′trf molecules accounted for an overwhelming proportion of the total small rnas bound to bmago <dig>  in the infected cells, especially bm-aspgtc-5′a, which accounted for  <dig> %  of the total bmago2-associated small rnas. the biogenesis of trfs under conditions of virus stress provides an important piece of evidence for their functional role in the cell. a previous report showed that trfs are endogenously associated with ago <dig> and are able to guide ago <dig> to cleave its target rna  <cit> . bmago <dig> could thus recruit large numbers of trfs, forming a rnp complex similar to risc and thereby regulating the expression of trf-guided target genes. the precise functions of trfs remain unknown and should be further studied.

transposable-element derived small rnas and pirnas
to identify small rnas derived from tes  associated with bmago <dig>  the unannotated reads were mapped to the bombyx mori tes. using this method, we obtained  <dig>  unique small rna reads derived from the tes, which accounted for  <dig> % of the total unique reads ;  <dig> % of these mapped to multiple locations . this finding suggests that the population of te-derived small rnas is significantly higher than that of the small rnas derived from mirnas, trnas, rrnas, snornas and snrnas in the bmago2-associated small rna population. the length distribution ranged from 18nt to 44nt and peaked at 20nt, with a secondary peak at 21nt, implying that the main sirna proportion comprised te-derived small rnas . tes are currently regarded as one of the principal forces driving genome diversity and evolution but must be under appropriate control to maintain genome integrity  <cit> . in bombyx mori, the repetitive sequences are estimated to account for  <dig> % of the total sequence  <cit> , implying that active functions and regulation of tes must be in action. we further investigated the te-derived small rnas restricted to particular classes of transposons. of the obtained  <dig> tes,  <dig> could generate small rnas at an abundance between  <dig> and  <dig> . the majority of these small rnas were derived mainly from ltr and line retrotransposons, similar to the small rnas associated with sjago <dig>  <cit> . the top  <dig> te-derived small rna clusters and their mapping reads are summarized in table  <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig>  the top  <dig> tes consisted of  <dig> ltr and  <dig> line tes; the only classii te was bmpiggybac-mer <dig>  a widely studied transposon in insects. a previous report showed that line bm <dig> strongly and preferentially generated antisense small rnas  <cit> . we further observed that bmago <dig> could associate with small rnas derived from bm <dig> including  <dig> antisense small rnas and  <dig> sense small rnas. the other tes preferentially produced antisense small rnas, including sart <dig>  bm <dig> and bm <dig> . only gypsy-20_bm-i preferentially produced sense small rnas .

*these contigs from the w chromosome contained tes and generated a large amount of small rnas around the tes, which might be related with the transcription of the tes.

**total reads of te-derived small rnas are shown in parenthesis.

§tes have been divided into two classes based on their transposition intermediate. class i tes use an rna-mediated mode of transposition and are further divided into two subclasses, including ltr and non-ltr retrotransposons. non-ltr retrotransposons are also called lines  and sines . class ii tes use a dna-mediated mode of "cut and paste" transposition. in bombyx mori, many tes have been identified, such as bm <dig>  bm <dig>  bm <dig> and sart <dig>  <cit> .

the pirnas are generated mainly from germline cells and are specifically loaded onto germline-specific argonaute proteins-piwi proteins  <cit> . strangely, using pirnapredictor  <cit>  and an in-house developed perl script, a total of  <dig>  reads were identified as pirna candidates among the te-derived small rna reads , which accounted for  <dig> % of the total unique reads. ping-pong pairs were defined as precise 10-nt overlaps between the sense and antisense te-derived pirnas and were a canonical feature of the pirnas. we also identified  <dig>  ping-pong pairs from the  <dig>  reads, with 5′-u and 10a pairing formed by  <dig>  sense and antisense pirnas. these results indicate that a single 10a-pirna might correspond to more than one 5′u-pirna and vice versa . the above results suggest that bmago <dig> may function to maintain genome stability by suppressing the activities of transposons.

known and novel mirnas associated with the bmago <dig> protein
to function, mirna must be assembled into risc  <cit> . the ago protein is the core component of risc. in recent years, the isolation of mirnas and mirna targets through the immunoprecipitation of ago protein complexes has become a well-characterized method to experimentally identify mirna targets  <cit> . therefore, large numbers of mirnas should be contained in the bmago2-associated small rnas. of the  <dig> bombyx mori mirnas recorded in the mirbase ,  <dig> were identified in the bmago2-associated small rna library, including  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> mirna*s,  <dig> mirna-5p and  <dig> mirna-3p species . some of these mirnas, such as bmo-bantam, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-mir- <dig>  exhibited a clear preference for binding to bmago <dig> with a high read copy of greater than  <dig> 

by mapping all reads to the precursors of known mirnas, we observed that for most known mirna precursors, the matched reads centered around mature mirna sequences and some mirna* sequences . however, some reads showed a smear distribution for certain mirna precursors , which was also observed in arabidopsis ago <dig> and ago <dig> associated mirna precursors. these mirnas were not regarded as bona fide mirnas, but rather as sirnas whose "precursors" also exhibited hairpin structures  <cit> .

sequence variants could be involved in the editing events, snps and their variations. mature mirna variants are also known as isomirs  <cit>  and are usually found by small rna deep sequencing  <cit> . a total of  <dig> different isomirs, each with an abundance of at least  <dig> % and representing  <dig> unique mirna and  <dig> unique mirna* species, were identified. the sequence length variations were not considered in this analysis, and all  <dig> identified isomir species were represented by different rna editing sites or unannotated snps . interestingly, for  <dig> of these mirna species, the identified responding isomirs exhibited an abundance of 100%, suggesting that the bmago <dig> protein had a clear preference for associating with the isomirs of these mirnas rather than with themselves.

to identify novel mirnas, mireap software was used to query the unannotated and other small rna reads. a total of  <dig> novel mirna species with a read copy number of no less than  <dig> were identified . the precursors of these predicted novel mirnas exhibited the typical stem-loop structure. to validate the candidate novel mirnas, stem-loop qpcr assays were developed. the results showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> novel candidate mirnas selected were detectable in the bmn cells, and their expression differed between the normal and the bmnpv-infected bmn cells . a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were identified from among the  <dig> unique reads. of the  <dig> reads,  <dig> were derived from unannotated reads; however, the remaining  <dig> were derived from the annotated te-derived small rnas , pirnas and snorna-derived small rnas described above. the tes and snornas could generate functional mirnas, and this phenomenon is regarded as one of the evolutionary mechanisms for mirna formation  <cit> . previously,  <dig> te-derived mirnas were also identified  <cit> . here, our results indicate that bombyx tes could generate mirnas associated with the bmago <dig> protein. in addition, the association between the risc effector complex and these  <dig> novel candidate mirnas also showed the biological feature of mirnas and further validated the prediction.

viral mirnas can inhibit both viral and host transcripts, and usually help in maintaining the persistent infection of a virus or modulating the host antiviral response  <cit> . bmnpv-encoded mirnas were first identified by j. singh et al. <cit> , and one of these, bmnpv-mir- <dig>  was shown to suppress host mirna biogenesis by regulating the exportin- <dig> cofactor ran  <cit> . the  <dig> mirnas that were first identified did not exist among the  <dig> bmnpv-encoded small rnas. however, nine novel potential viral mirnas were identified from among the  <dig> bmnpv-encoded small rnas  using mirexplorer software  <cit> , and these should be further validated.

other novel small rnas derived from rrnas, snornas and snrnas
many groups have reported finding novel small rnas derived from housekeeping non-coding rnas, such as rrnas, snornas and snrnas  <cit> . in addition to the trfs and mirnas, we found a large number of small rna reads derived from rrnas, snornas and snrnas, implying that various types of small ncrnas associate with bmago <dig> .

a total of  <dig> reads with copy numbers less than  <dig> mapped to the 5′ and 3′ termini of  <dig> s rrna. using overlapping probes, the small rna species derived from the 5′ termini of  <dig> s rrna were further identified by northern blotting, and their size was found to be approximately 50nt. these small rnas exhibited a slightly lower expression level in the virus-infected bmn cells than in the normal bmn cells . however, we failed to detect small rnas originating from other locations of  <dig> s rrna by northern blotting.

li et al. previously identified  <dig> snornas from the 50-500nt portion of the total rna of bombyx mori using rnomics and comparative genomics methods  <cit> . of the  <dig> snornas,  <dig> were found to generate small rnas, mainly from 5′ and 3′ termini. a total of  <dig> unique reads showed a 5′ and 3′ terminal distribution for the  <dig> snorna sequences . snornas usually function as guide rnas to direct sequence-specific modifications of the targeted rna. recent work has shown that some mirna precursors and snornas share the same features, and snornas can also give rise to small rnas with mirna-like functions, suggesting that these classes of rnas may have an evolutionary relationship  <cit> . like mirnas, snorna-derived small rnas are also functionally associated with the argonaute protein  <cit> . using mirexplorer software  <cit> , we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> snornas exhibited perfect hairpin structures similar to those of pre-mirnas ; these consisted of  <dig> unique reads with a total read copy number of  <dig>  . the numerous snorna-derived molecules associated with bmago <dig> will require further study.

discussion
ago proteins are the key component of the sirna and mirna pathway and are indispensable binding proteins for the function of many other small rnas. for example, trf must bind ago <dig> to direct the cleavage of target rnas, which contain a perfect complementary sequence to the trf  <cit> . using bmago <dig> polyclonal antibody, endogenous bmago <dig> was identified in bmn cells . the ago <dig> protein usually displays a mg2+-dependent endonuclease activity, and mg2+ provides a favorable contribution to the binding of the dna-rna to the ago <dig> protein  <cit> . our work demonstrates that recombinant bmago <dig> could exhibit an endonuclease activity and cleave the ip rna products when edta is removed from the lysis buffer , suggesting recombinant his-tagged bmago <dig> might exhibit the same physiological activity as endogenous bmago <dig> 

using a his monoclonal antibody, we successfully isolated bmago2-associated small rnas by immunoprecipitation from the bmn cells. we used an rip-seq method to obtain a total of  <dig>  bmago2-associated unique small rnas from the ovary-derived bmn cells,  <dig>  of which we could not match to the reference genome of the male silkworm. the unmatched reads might be derived from the w chromosome or might map to potential gaps in the sequenced female genome. to date, many species of small rnas have been identified in bombyx mori, including mirnas  <cit> , pirnas  <cit> , te-derived small rnas  <cit>  and snorna/snrnas of between 50nt and 500nt  <cit> . in the present work, we identified bmago2-associated small rnas between 18nt and 50nt in length, including the first identified trfs, rrna-, snorna- and snrna-derived small rnas in this species, as well as previously identified mirnas, pirnas and te-derived small rnas. importantly, the bmago <dig> protein was found to recruit trfs at an extremely high abundance , suggesting that trfs could function by binding the bmago <dig> protein.

we further employed northern blotting to identify trfs, and the results showed two obvious bands responding to the trnas and trfs, respectively, suggesting that trfs are a stable and novel class of small rnas . previous studies have shown that the ang nuclease can generate 30-50nt long sitrnas under conditions of stress from the anti-codon loops, and it has been reported to be a trna-specific enzyme  <cit> . the bombyx 5′ and 3′trfs identified here by northern blotting were approximately ~33nt and ~40nt long, respectively. northern blotting with overlapping probes further confirmed that the ~40nt 3′trfs were generated by cleaving the anti-codon loops of the 72nt trnas . these 5′ and 3′trfs might be sitrnas that are produced by the ang nuclease. our deep sequencing results further suggested that the ~33nt 5′trfs and the ~40nt 3′trfs could be further cleaved on their d and tψc loops by a certain nuclease, thereby generating the ~18nt 5′ truncated trfs and ~21nt 3′trailer trfs , respectively. however, we failed to detect these bmago2-associated trfs by northern blotting from among the total rnas of the normal or bmnpv-infected bmn cells, possible due to the low abundance of these trf species. ang and other rnases may be involved in generating these small trf species, which can cleave trnas to produce ~20nt terminal trfs  <cit> . furthermore, a previous study also showed that the major determinant in the processing of terminal small trfs by ang and possibly by related rnases is the tψc loop within the trna. the ang trf cleavage site is known to be located between the first and second base after the gttc motif on the tψc loop  <cit> . our deep sequencing data show that a conserved gttc domain exists at the termini of most 21nt 3′trailer trfs, suggesting there is a potential trf cleavage site between the gttc cytosine and the first base after the gttc motif on tψc loop . the 3′trailer trfs could not be detected by northern blotting as they had a low total rna abundance; however, the 3′ trailer trfs were significantly more abundant than the 3′trfs in the bmago2-associated total rna. in the sequenced bmago2-associated small rnas, the read copies of the 3′trailer trfs were far greater than those of the 3′trfs , suggesting that the 3′trailer trfs preferentially associated with bmago <dig> for their functions, which might be similar to those of the sirna pathway. for the trnas with a variable arm, the d loop could be cleaved at the ggccgagcgg cleavage site, generating the ~18nt 5′truncated trfs . this result implies a possible relationship between the d loop cleavage and the variable arm during the biogenesis of 5′truncated trfs.

the trf biogenesis that occurs under conditions of viral stress provides an important piece of evidence about the functional role of trfs. the present work shows that when the bmn cells were infected with bmnpv, many trfs were generated and recruited onto the bmago <dig> protein. therefore, these trfs were enriched among the bmago2-associated small rnas. the majority of these 5′trfs identified by northern blotting were expressed only in bmnpv-infected cells , whereas the other trf species identified by northern blotting were usually expressed in both the normal and the virus-infected cells , suggesting the main trf species generated by viral stress may be the 5′trfs. the asymmetric expression of 5′trfs implies a relationship between the 5′trfs and bmnpv infection in the bmn cells. furthermore, 5′trfs accounted for an overwhelming proportion of the bmago2-associated small rnas. this was especially true for bm-aspgtc-5′a, which accounted for  <dig> % of the total bmago2-associated small rnas. these observations suggest that the 5′trfs are likely to bind the bmago <dig> protein and thus influence the bmnpv infection.

the pirna system is thought to provide a germline defense against te activity. a similar function was also recently noted in the sirna pathway  <cit> . drosophila utilizes two small-rna systems to restrict transposon activity in its germline  and soma ; in this system, ago <dig> deficiency results in increased levels of transposon transcripts  <cit> . in mouse oocytes, the loss of ago <dig> can result in decreased levels of sirnas and increased levels of retrotransposons  <cit> . in s. japonicum, sjago <dig> strongly associated with te-derived sirnas and is believed to regulate transposons  <cit> . these observations indicate that the ago <dig> protein might be involved in regulating transposons at the transcriptional level in germline cells. the bmn cell line was obtained from the bombyx ovary. te-derived small rnas accounted for almost half of the total unique bmago2-associated small rnas. the peak of their length distribution was the typical sirna length. therefore, we suggested that bmago <dig> could execute important functions in the maintenance of genome stability in germline cells through an rnai-like pathway.

pirnapredictor is a software program for pirna prediction that uses a novel 'dynamic’ algorithm with a precision of over 90% and a sensitivity of over 60%  <cit> . using pirnapredictor supplemented with a perl script for screening ping-pong pairs,  <dig>  >25nt pirna candidates and  <dig>  typical ping-pong pairs were identified from among the te-derived small rnas associated with bmago <dig>  in addition, we further identified  <dig>  >25nt pirna candidates and  <dig>  ping-pong pairs with  <dig>  sense pirnas and  <dig>  antisense pirnas from the remaining unannotated reads . these pirna candidates could not be mapped to the identified tes and could be derived from some heterochromatic regions, other repeat sequences and unknown transposons in the bombyx genome. pirna is thought to defend the host genome against transposons in bombyx mori <cit> . recently, an increasing number of pirnas have been identified in bombyx mori <cit> , and their biogenesis has been further studied, providing evidence for their "ping-pong circle" and biosynthesis mechanisms  <cit> . we further compared our data with the previously identified pirnas  <cit> . the results showed that our data has  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  overlap  with the te-, bmn4-, siwi-, bmago3-, ovary- and testis-derived pirnas, respectively. this overlap serves as an indicator of the high reliability of our dataset. we first identified pirnas associated with the bmago <dig> protein, which also contains paz and piwi domains. bmago <dig> might bind to pirna-like rna molecules through the paz domain, the biogenesis of which could be similar with that of pirnas. the observations above suggest that bmago <dig> can associate with the 20 ~ 22nt te-derived sirnas and the >25nt pirna-like small rnas during the regulation of transposon expression.

we must emphasize that many more reads did not align to previously known ncrnas, such as mirnas in mirbase, trnas, rrnas, pirnas, snornas, snrnas and other reported bombyx mori small rnas  <cit> , indicating that many small rnas remain to be discovered in bombyx mori. the unannotated small rnas associated with bmago <dig> usually exhibit a higher abundance than the mirnas. only  <dig> mirnas had a read copy of at least  <dig> , but  <dig> unannotated small rnas had a read copy of at least  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully overexpressed bmago <dig> under the control of the ie <dig> promoter in bmn cells using a recombinant bmnpv virus and used an rip-seq approach to identify the associated small non-coding rnas . various types of small ncrnas were found to be associated with bmago <dig>  including trna-, te-, rrna-, snorna- and snrna-derived small rnas, as well as mirnas and pirnas. the trfs were the most abundant class of bmago2-associated small rnas. however, northern blotting analysis showed that many of the trfs were only expressed or significantly up-regulated in the bmnpv infected cells, implying that they act by binding bmago <dig> during the response of bombyx mori to bmnpv. we also demonstrated that a significant fraction of the small rnas associated with bmago <dig> are derived from tes, many of which were identified as pirna candidates. this finding suggests that they may function to maintain genome stability through the suppression of transposon activity. finally, we also identified a large number of mirnas associated with bmago <dig>  including  <dig> novel mirnas. taken together, the above findings provide new clues for the future functional study of small rnas during insect development and evolution.
