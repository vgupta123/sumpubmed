BACKGROUND
due to rapid advancement in peptide and peptidomimetic techniques, pharmaceutical companies are focusing towards peptides-based therapeutics
 <cit> . a large number of peptides like insulin
 <cit> , cyclosporine
 <cit> , corticotropin
 <cit>  are used for treating various diseases like diabetes and immunoregulatory disorders
. owing to their immense therapeutic importance, peptides have been curated from literature and stored in form of databases such as hemolytik
 <cit> , phytamp
 <cit> , apd2
 <cit> , dampd
 <cit> , camp
 <cit> , yadamp
 <cit> , cppsite
 <cit> , tumorhope
 <cit> , quorumpeps
 <cit> , brainpeps
 <cit> , milkamp
 <cit> , dadp
 <cit> , lamp
 <cit>  and avpdb
 <cit>  to name a few. also, a number of computation tools such as cellppd
 <cit> , tumorhpd
 <cit> , anticp
 <cit> , avppred
 <cit>  and toxinpred
 <cit>  have been developed to predict and design cell penetrating, tumor homing, anticancer, antiviral and toxic peptides, respectively. presently, most of the therapeutic peptides are used in the form of injection via subcutaneous, intravenous/intramuscular route. in addition, alternate routes such as pulmonary
 <cit> , oral
 <cit> , intranasal
 <cit> , buccal
 <cit> , transdermal
 <cit> , ocular
 <cit>  and rectal
 <cit>  have been tested. among all routes of drug delivery, oral is the most preferred route because oral formulations are less expensive and less prone to infection caused by inappropriate use/reuse of needles. additionally, orally available peptides are highly accepted by patients, which increases the therapeutic value of the drug. however, designing and formulating an oral peptide has been considered as a challenging job. this is because of their undesirable physicochemical properties like large molecular size, high susceptibility to enzymatic degradation , hepatic and renal clearance, etc.

amongst the above factors, peptide stability is one of the most difficult tasks to maintain. their high susceptibility to proteases in the gut and serum  and fast degradation rate due to their arginine and lysine content makes them low orally bioavailable
 <cit> . a major concern associated with the use of peptide therapeutics is improving their stability by protection against degrading proteases
 <cit> . although, a number of experimental techniques like peptide modification are available in order to improve peptide stability with high accuracy
 <cit> , yet these experimental procedures are costly and time consuming. in view of its importance, there is a need to develop an in silico method for predicting 1) half-life of peptides as well as 2) prediction of mutations required in a peptide, in order to increase its intestinal half-life. in past, computational methods for predicting half-life of proteins/peptides in blood and kidney cells/cell lines have been developed. for example, protparam is a tool that helps to estimate half-life of a protein stored in swiss-prot/trembl or a user entered protein. the estimation of half-life is done for three experimental models namely: yeast in vivo, mammalian reticulocytes  in vitro and escherichia coli in vivo
 <cit> . stability prediction tool predicts the stability of hiv-derived peptides in cytosolic extracts from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
 <cit> . sprotp is a web server to recognize the short-lived proteins  in 293 t cells 
 <cit> . the n-end rule
 <cit>  based ‘protlifepred server’  takes into account the ubiquitination  process of proteins
 and predicts their stability in s. cerevisiae, e. coli and mammalian cells. best of author’s knowledge there is no computational method developed for designing/predicting stability/half-life of peptides in intestine-like environment.

in order to facilitate researchers working in the field of therapeutic peptides, we have developed in silico models for predicting half-life of peptides. these models were developed using a set of peptides whose half-lives have been experimentally determined in crude intestinal proteases preparation
 <cit> . server developed in this study can be used to identify minimum mutations in a peptide required to optimize their half-life.

RESULTS
analysis of half-life data
we computed and analyzed physicochemical properties of peptides in both hl <dig> and hl <dig> datasets to understand relation between property of amino acids and their half-life. based on the half-life value, peptides were classified into two categories peptides having long half-life  and peptides having short half-life . each category have top  <dig> peptides, it means  <dig> peptides having longest half-life were classified as stable and  <dig> peptides having shortest half-life were classified as unstable. we observed that negatively charged, neutral and tiny types of residues are more prominent in highly stable peptides . we have also computed amino acid composition of peptides in highly and lowest/poorly stable peptide datasets. as shown in figure 
 <dig> , residues ala, asp, glu, gly, gln, ser and thr are abundant in peptide dataset with longer half-life. as evident from additional file

development of web server/software
based on above study, we developed a web server for predicting intestinal half-life of peptides to design stable peptides through mutant generation and whole protein scanning. hlp server has three main modules called peptide, protein and batch module. first module i.e., peptide, allows users to submit single peptide at a time to the web server for predicting its intestinal half-life and designing mutants which may have better half-life and physicochemical properties than original peptide. protein module allows a user to submit a protein for scanning to find peptide having high intestinal half-life. furthermore, it allow to generate mutant peptides corresponding to user-selected peptide. third module i.e., batch, designed for high throughput scanning where a user can submit a large number of peptides for filtering best peptides . our hlp server implement total six type of models; these can be divided in two classes: svm based models  and weka based models . our svm based models implemented using following type of information of peptides; i) dipeptide composition in case of 10mer peptides, ii) amino acid composition for 16mer peptides and iii) type of composition depend on peptide length in case of user-selected sequence length. in case of weka based models, following techniques and peptide information is used; i) ibk model using eight dipeptides  for 10mer peptides, ii) decisiontable using three dipeptides  for 16mer peptides and iii) model selection depends on peptide length in case of user-selected sequence length. the hlp web server was developed using perl, cgi and html languages; it is available freely for public use from url http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/hlp/.

discussion
although a number of peptides have entered in market against various indications  still one of the major challenges in success of peptide-based therapy is their low half-life in serum and gut. there are number of factors responsible for degrading or shortening half-life of peptides
 <cit> ; where in silico designing of peptides seems to be a promising field in the area of peptide based therapy. the presence of intestinal proteases is one of the major factors behind degradation of peptides. in vitro peptide stability screening is considered to be the most difficult and time-consuming task. in order to assist scientific community to screen stable peptide in intestine-like environment, we have made a systematic attempt in this direction. in this study, models have been developed for predicting half-life of peptides on dataset derived from gorris et al.,  <dig>  where half-lives of peptides have been experimentally determined in the presence of crude intestinal proteases . firstly, they calculated half-life of peptides in undiluted proteolytic solution and then it has been subsequently extrapolated from results obtained from diluted solutions. the analysis based on these datasets suggest that charge and size of an amino acid are the two major factors governing the peptide stability. as reported in previous studies on bioactive peptides
, positively charge amino acids arg and lys are preferred among majority of these kind of peptides while the present study reports these residues responsible to decrease peptide’s intestinal half-life. therefore, the residues affecting peptide’s half-life and bioactivity should be optimized simultaneously while designing highly stable and potent bioactive peptides. the presence of large size amino acids such as phe, arg, tyr and trp will increase protease susceptibility and tiny amino acids  may help in their stabilization. among these large-size amino acids, three  belong to aromatic class and are also responsible for the decreased half-life. hlp models, developed on a small dataset shows good correlation  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  between predicted and actual half-life value on hl <dig> and hl <dig> dataset, respectively. one of two major limitations of our method is that it is not suitable for predicting the stability of modified peptides like n-terminal/c-terminal modification or effect of disulphide bond in a peptide. therefore, our model is only suitable for predicting the stability of peptide composed of natural amino acids without any chemical modifications. another limitation of the present study is the presence of small dataset in training and testing the half-life models due to unavailability of large dataset on peptide half-life in intestine from literature. the actual half-lives have been calculated in highly concentrated environment. gorris et al. assume that the half-life values would be very high in real life. unfortunately, they haven’t mentioned quantitatively, how high these half-lives values would be in real life. thus, the half-life dataset helps in estimating half-lives of peptides relatively rather than in absolute terms. just for our satisfaction and to test how good the models will work on peptides having very high half-lives, we developed new models after multiplying peptide’s actual half-life with  <dig> and  <dig>  as evident from additional file
2: tables s1-s <dig>  half-life prediction models performs equally well for higher half-life containing peptides, irrespective of very high/low half-life. hence, hlp can prove to be a extremely good resource to relatively estimate the half-life of peptides in intestine like environment. additionally, this can help in improving half-life of peptide half-life by mutating residue. we hope that our study will be useful to scientific community for designing/prediction of stable peptides and thus helpful in solving the major barrier in peptide based drug development.

CONCLUSIONS
there is a growing demand of peptide-based drugs but the major bottleneck in their development is their short half-life. the present study can provide an efficient method to design therapeutic peptides having better half-life and physicochemical properties. we hope that our method would promote the usage of various types of therapeutic peptides in drug discovery and development.
