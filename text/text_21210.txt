BACKGROUND
in addition to quantification of mrna after reverse transcription, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  technology has been utilized for diverse applications including detection and quantification of bacterial or viral pathogens  <cit> , detection of mrna splice variants  <cit> , and quantification of transgene copy numbers  <cit> . fluorescence-based dissociation curve analysis has been used for detection of dna sequence polymorphisms from large deletions  <cit>  to single nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit> .

since development of methods to construct marker maps via radiation hybrid  somatic cell culture panels  <cit> , rh mapping has become a method of choice. for large mammals, the generation interval and animal husbandry costs make construction of genetic maps expensive and lengthy endeavors. many livestock species, particularly those important in countries where resources for genetic evaluation and improvement are scarce, can benefit greatly from continued mapping efforts. for species whose genomes have been sequenced, rh mapping remains a useful tool to aid assembly of sequence scaffolds  <cit> . methods for construction of whole-genome rh mapping panels have been described in detail previously  <cit> , and to date, whole-genome rh mapping panels have been produced for livestock animals including pig  <cit>  chicken  <cit> , horse  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and river buffalo  <cit> . as livestock, river buffalo  provide a source of meat, dairy products, and draught power throughout the world including asia, south america, the mediterranean, and other regions . this species can benefit from the same selection and mapping efforts that have been applied to domestic cattle  <cit> .

once an rh panel is constructed, development of maps involves three major steps: 1) marker development, 2) marker scoring, and 3) computation of optimal marker order. the availability of genome sequences from related organisms has speeded marker development  <cit> , and new software for computing rh maps  <cit>  makes computation fast, leaving marker scoring as the major time bottleneck in construction of rh maps. gel-based methods  are labor intensive, and in cases where pcr products can be amplified from both donor and recipient dna, products must usually be differentiated on the basis of size. here we demonstrate the novel application of qpcr technology and dissociation curve analysis as a rapid and robust method for typing radiation hybrid panel dna, and construct a map of river buffalo  chromosome  <dig>  as proof of principle.

RESULTS
initial marker testing
river buffalo chromosome  <dig> is orthologous to domestic cattle  chromosome  <dig> . significant sequence conservation between river buffalo and cattle allows new buffalo maps to be generated from bovine markers  <cit> . to rapidly generate a map of bbu <dig>  we took advantage of the existing published bta <dig> marker map to identify pcr primers that could be used for mapping in buffalo. we chose primers for  <dig> markers or genes that were derived from cattle sequence and had been previously mapped to bta <dig>  to determine suitability for rh panel typing, we screened primer pairs by pcr-amplification of dna from river buffalo , a <dig> hamster , and cattle  fibroblast cells, followed by dissociation curve analysis of the products as described by ririe et al.  <cit> . of  <dig> marker primer sets,  <dig> markers were suitable for further analysis because they amplified river buffalo dna well, exhibited dissociation curves that differed between the river buffalo and hamster products, and produced single product bands when checked by gel electrophoresis . the remaining markers were discarded because they produced more than one river buffalo band, could not differentiate hamster and buffalo pcr products, or did not amplify. for more detailed explanation, see additional file  <dig> and  <dig>  most of the primers used came from previously published bovine maps, and pcr optimization was not conducted because our objective was to implement a standardized qpcr protocol for screening and analysis to develop a rapid and efficient mapping method. we also compared data from manually prepared 96-well reactions to semi-automated robot-prepared 384-well reaction plates and obtained comparable results .

comparison of dissociation curve and gel-based typing methods
we typed  <dig> markers in a panel of  <dig> rh clones. twenty-four markers were easily typed on the rh panel by both qpcr and gel electrophoresis, meaning that both agarose gels and dissociation curves resulted in clear differentiation of hamster and buffalo pcr products from individual hybrid clones. of the  <dig> markers typed by both methods,  <dig> were scored unambiguously in all  <dig> rh clones and exhibited perfect accord between the two methods. sample gel images and dissociation curves are shown in figure  <dig>  the remaining  <dig> markers were scored consistently by both methods in the majority of the rh clones, but  <dig> to  <dig> clones  were scored as questionable  by one or the other method.

an additional  <dig> markers  could be scored for mapping by the qpcr method alone under the described experimental reaction conditions. for  <dig> markers , discrete and scorable dissociation curves were clearly seen, but agarose gel electrophoresis of pcr products resulted in bands that were indistinguishable between river buffalo and hamster . sequence analysis of these markers  indicated that their pcr products actually differed in size by  <dig> to  <dig> bp between river buffalo and hamster. sequence composition of the products also differed between the two species, resulting in different melting temperatures that could be readily scored . the remaining primer sets  amplified so weakly that bands were too faint for reliable gel-based visual scoring, but signals observed by dissociation curve analysis were easily scored . in particular, rm <dig> produced a very strong primer-dimer band that overwhelmed the gel image, while the dissociation curve contained distinct peaks that readily distinguished the primer-dimer from the actual product.

the remaining marker, akt <dig>  was the only marker to produce scorable data by gel-based typing alone, as a number of the rh clones exhibited dissociation curves that did not match either of the controls. the akt <dig> primer set produced a river buffalo band of about  <dig> bp  in the clones that were scored positive by gel electrophoresis, while the negative clones exhibited one or more bands other than the target that presumably muddled the qpcr data .

rh map construction
to further compare the two methods, we constructed separate rh maps of bbu <dig> from the qpcr- and gel-based scores. on the basis of qpcr scores, all  <dig> markers formed a single linkage group at lod  <dig>  of which  <dig> are included in the "qpcr map"  that covers 92% of the marc linkage map of cattle chromosome  <dig> . the three remaining markers  could not be reliably placed in a specific interval of the framework map. for the "gel map,"  <dig> of  <dig> markers were included, but it was necessary to reduce the lod score cutoff to  <dig>  to have those  <dig> markers form a single linkage group . among markers common to both maps, the marker order was identical; i.e., slight differences in the marker scores had no effect on the optimal map order.

discussion
dissociation curve analysis is a viable alternative to conventional gel-based typing for rh mapping. in this case, primer sets chosen for rh mapping of river buffalo were based on sequence data from cattle, a related species. we expect that the method will be applicable to dissociation curve and high resolution melt analysis utilizing dyes such as syto  <dig>  lcgreen, and evagreen in addition to the sybr green i utilized in this study. this mapping strategy allowed rapid genome mapping of our species of interest based on the existing high density marker map of the domestic cow. markers for mapping were chosen more or less randomly to provide approximately even coverage of bta <dig> microsatellite markers. we utilized a standardized pcr protocol without optimization to enable rapid, high-throughput gene mapping. despite these constraints, we were able to type nearly half of the markers we tested, similar or slightly better than the success rate attained by our colleagues using conventional methods . although greater success rates might have been achieved after pcr optimization for individual primer sets and a smaller proportion of microsatellite markers , our protocol reduced both time and resources spent identifying suitable markers by utilizing a single protocol.

dissociation curve analysis is more robust than conventional typing. we typed 25% more markers by qpcr than by the gel-based method. while some of those markers might have yielded better gel-based data  upon pcr optimization, qpcr data were produced without the use of additional time and resources necessary for optimization. under conventional methods, some markers would have been discarded entirely without further consideration. the ability to differentiate pcr products not only by size, but also by sequence composition, is perhaps the greatest advantage of the qpcr method. indeed, any means undertaken to increase the number of markers suitable for the gel-based map, such as a larger proportion of sts markers or coding genes, a requirement for well-designed primers , or optimization of the pcr protocol, would likely have led to a greater percentage of markers being included on the qpcr-based map.

the increased sensitivity of qpcr technology may reduce the incidence of scoring errors. indirect evidence of more accurate scores is that 90% of the markers analyzed for the qpcr map ultimately comprised that map, compared to only 80% inclusion of analyzed markers in the linkage group for the gel map, even though the qpcr map used a higher lod score threshold. furthermore, among  <dig> markers typed on the agarose gels, individual clones were scored as questionable on a single pcr replicate due to faint bands or spurious bands of similar size to the target amplicon in  <dig> instances . in contrast, among  <dig> markers typed by qpcr, only  <dig> instances  of questionable results occurred in single replicates, generally due to shorter peaks for the buffalo product when the hamster product also amplified well. conventional methods require duplicate typing to confirm accuracy and resolve questionable typing results. while qpcr technology does not completely eliminate the need for duplicate reactions, our observations indicate that qpcr typing may yield more accurate results than gel-based typing. moreover, elimination of agarose gels removes the need for post-amplification handling and reduces opportunities for technical errors.

typing data are generally scored as  <dig>  or  <dig> , with questionable results scored as  <dig>  reducing the number of ambiguous  <dig> scores is important because addressing ambiguous scores computationally remains controversial. during rh map computation, different software packages use different mathematical formulations of the maximum likelihood criterion when ambiguous scores are present in the data  <cit> . in this study, the presence of clones scored as  <dig> in these bbu <dig> data sets did not affect the map order or which markers could be retained, but the presence of 2s in data for other maps we have computed has forced numerous markers to be dropped due to the ambiguity.

among more than  <dig> individual scores  from the  <dig> markers scored by both qpcr and gel electrophoresis, only  <dig> scores were discordant between the two methods. two and  <dig> individual clones were scored as questionable by qpcr for dik <dig> and cc <dig>  respectively, due to intermediate dissociation curves. on the gel, each of these markers had distinct river buffalo and hamster bands clearly distinguishable by size. most rh clones exhibited one band or the other, and these were in perfect accord with the qpcr data, but the questionable clones exhibited both bands . two clones were also scored as questionable by qpcr for dik <dig>  along with one questionable curve for idvga-39; all were scored positive on the gels, but consistently exhibited weak bands in comparison to the other positive clones . finally, two clones were scored as questionable for mfge <dig> by gel-based typing due to the consistent presence of a faint band at the expected size. both clones were clearly negative by qpcr, so the gel bands were sequenced. neither sequence matched the expected product; in fact, neither band produced clean sequence, indicating that dissociation curve analysis yielded more accurate results in this instance. in this experiment, with only  <dig> markers on the map, scoring those two clones as ambiguous did not affect the placement of mfge <dig> on the map. as the river buffalo mapping project continues and the map becomes more dense, similar errors could change the statistically optimal marker order.

dissociation curve analysis utilizes fewer resources than conventional typing. while the actual cost of typing a single marker by either method may vary greatly depending on choice of particular reagents and plastic ware, we applied similar criteria to reagent selection for both methods and found similar costs for pcr amplification . the beauty of the qpcr method is that elimination of post-amplification procedures  reduces the labor time required to type each marker. at the same time, expense and hazardous waste associated with agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining procedures is eliminated.

other non-conventional pcr-based methods have been applied to rh mapping including single-strand conformational polymorphism , where pcr products can be differentiated based on sequence composition, and amplified length polymorphism , which has the advantage of producing markers without any prior sequence information for the species of interest, but results in essentially anonymous markers. however, these methods and related techniques require post-amplification separation and visualization of products by radioisotopic labeling  <cit>  or silver staining  <cit> , which necessitates additional handling and disposal of hazardous materials. fluorescence labeling  <cit>  reduces hazardous materials but still requires time-consuming procedures for separation and visualization of pcr products.

high-throughput methods will have great utility for map construction. for example, mckay et al  <cit>  computed a dense bovine rh map with illumina golden gate technology. once the effort to make the illumina array is completed, all the markers can be genotyped rapidly. thus, the cost per marker decreases greatly, but once the array design is completed, one cannot easily add individual markers of interest. for techniques such as those used by mckay et al, or for application of "next generation" sequencing technology, or utilization of snp microarrays, the cost per sample is relatively low. however, startup costs remain high, and the volume of data to be processed must also be considered. for many species still lacking maps, suitable array-based tool are simply unavailable, emphasizing the importance of alternative methods for genotyping and map building. in practice, we have found that application of some of these methods to rh mapping is costly and data interpretation is not completely straightforward at this time . in contrast, assuming available instrumentation, startup cost to run a single marker by qpcr is the same cost as equivalent pcr amplification, and likely more accessible to research groups involved in mapping species for which both gene maps and financial resources are currently limited.

the application of qpcr technology and fluorescence chemistry to dna typing does impose limits on marker choice, particularly amplicon size. in this case, because sybr green i fluoresces upon laser excitation when bound to any double-stranded dna, formation of primer-dimers may alter the dissociation curve of small  pcr products. anecdotal evidence and our experience indicate that sybr-based dissociation curves appear to be most reliable for product sizes greater than  <dig> bp. some of the odd dissociation curves we observed with akt <dig> may have been influenced by the small pcr product size  of that marker. indeed, it was the only marker that we attempted to type that was <  <dig> bp, and the only one that failed to produce clear, consistent results in the rh panel by qpcr. large amplicons  are not amplified as efficiently and may also produce inconsistent results. a brief survey of published rh maps indicates that pcr-based markers tend to fall in the range of 75– <dig> bp, with the majority ranging from 100– <dig> bp. in this experiment, the largest amplicon generated was ~ <dig> bp, so we did not observe any deleterious effects due to large product size. ultimately the success of qpcr and subsequent dissociation curve analysis relies on the use of well-designed primers that clearly amplify a single product. furthermore, pcr products of different sizes may have similar melting temperatures. for example, bm <dig> amplified two products from river buffalo dna, as shown in the agarose gel, but displayed a single dissociation peak . we excised and sequenced both products visualized in the gel and calculated that the melting temperatures of the two products were within 1°c of each other, but amplicons did not appear to represent alleles of the same gene. therefore, it may still be beneficial to test primer sets by visualizing control reactions via gel electrophoresis to ensure the presence of a single pcr product before proceeding with mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we developed a new method of marker scoring for rh maps. sybr green i-based qpcr and dissociation curve analysis offered greater sensitivity than the conventional gel-based scoring method, for detection of differences between buffalo and hamster products as well as reduction of scoring errors. to prove that this method can lead to better maps faster, we generated maps of river buffalo chromosome  <dig> using both old and new methods. the qpcr map contained 35% more markers and was based on a higher lod score cutoff than the gel-based map. we have demonstrated that this novel application of dissociation curve analysis provides a reliable and efficient improvement over conventional methods for marker scoring in any species where rh mapping panels are available. marker scoring remains the most labor-intensive step in rh map development. this sensitive method of qpcr-based marker scoring should enable faster construction of rh maps. as high-throughput methods are being developed for cross-species analysis, this method will remain a useful adjunct mapping tool.
