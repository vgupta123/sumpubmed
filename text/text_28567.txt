BACKGROUND
extreme environments provide simplified microbial communities which may be usefully compared and contrasted with more complex ecosystems. community complexity is often assessed in terms of the diversity of phylogenetic markers such as 16s ribosomal rna – but generally we do not know the extent to which organisms with identical or very similar sequences for phylogenetic sequences differ in other shared genes and in gene content. indeed, complete genome sequences for multiple strains of the same species  often reveal widely different gene complements  <cit> . genes present in only a few strains of a species have been described as "accessory or adaptive", since they do not appear to be essential for cell survival, but instead provide the possibility to adapt to environmental fluctuations   <cit> . knowledge about accessory gene pools  will be essential in areas from ecology  to biotechnology .

one approach to assessing a species' or accessory gene pool is to compare a sequenced genome to a metagenomic sequence database obtained from an environment in which that organism dominates. in this way the usual biases and limitations associated with comparing different isolates from the same species by complete genome sequencing and/or substractive or microarray hybridization are avoided. a recent paper describing an acid mine drainage biofilm metagenome using shotgun cloning and sequencing detected very little gene content diversity among two dominant species in the community  <cit> . our results suggest a different pattern for saltern crystallizers.

saltern crystallizers  have been studied extensively by molecular methods and prove to be among the simplest known communities in terms of species composition by both classical microbiological and molecular methods  <cit> . the saturated nacl concentrations together with high levels of magnesium inhibit the growth of all but the most resilient hyperhalophilic archaea and bacteria  <cit> . a number of molecular approaches have shown that the dense prokaryotic populations  are largely dominated by members of the recently cultivated square-shaped archaeon "haloquadratum walsbyi"  <cit> . this organism was first described in  <dig> before the recognition of the domain archaea and was for a long time known as "walsby's square bacterium"  <cit> . the species appears cosmopolitan: 16s rdna sequences retrieved from these haloarchaea do not diverge by more than  <dig> % worldwide,]: spanish and australian isolates  <cit>  differ only in two nucleotides across the whole 16s rrna gene  <cit> . the peculiar morphology of this organism  permits enrichment by filtration ; smaller rod and spiral-shaped cells pass through a  <dig> μm pore size filter and the square-shaped cells are retained. the genome of the spanish isolate hqsb <dig> has been fully sequenced and annotated and we had access to the annotated genome of this strain  <cit> .

in this work we isolated biomass from a saltern crystallizer with the aim of retrieving mostly "h. walsbyi"- related material, and compared the recovered gene diversity with that of the sequenced strain's genome, isolated specifically from this same pond two years earlier  <cit> . the results of this study, which involved end-sequencing of ca.  <dig> fosmid clones suggest that "h. walsbyi" shares a large accessory gene pool that could easily exceed the size of the sequenced strain's genome.

RESULTS
metagenomic library coverage and taxonomic diversity
the crystallizer pond populations from which this dna was extracted has been the focus of a series of molecular studies over the last  <dig> years, and we have substantial information regarding the prokaryotic composition of this particular pond  <cit> . however, the microbial community could be affected by long term or seasonal changes so we used pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing to characterize the specific sample used for metagenomic library construction and as a control for the suitability of the filtration method used for sample fractionation . we sequenced about  <dig> cloned 16s rdna genes from each fraction . as expected the proportion of "haloquadratum"-related clones was appreciably higher in the  <dig> μm fraction  than the  <dig>  μm fraction . additionally, salinibacter ruber, the other major component of the community  <cit>  was effectively removed from the  <dig> μm fraction  which is confirmed in the fosmid library analysis . as expected, the diversity of both archaea and bacteria was very restricted. "haloquadratum"-related clones were predominant in the archaeal primers clone library. out of  <dig> clones  <dig> were highly similar to "haloquadratum" seven were similar to haloarchaeon csw <dig> . <dig> , an isolate from a crystallizer pond in victoria, australia  <cit> , three were similar to halosimplex carlsbadense and three were similar to halorubrum tibetense. among the "haloquadratum"-related clones the variability was extremely low, with most sequences diverging less than 1%. moreover these clones were highly related  to sequences retrieved from the same pond by pcr amplification twelve years ago  <cit> . overall, the "haloquadratum" affiliated 16s rdna gene sequences retrieved from this pond in different surveys and with different methodologies were highly conserved, and never diverged more than  <dig> %, reflecting the high degree of homogeneity of the 16s rrna genes of this species and/or the stability of the population in this crystallizer.

the fosmid library constructed from the  <dig> μm fraction was composed of ca  <dig> clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb. thus, the total amount of cloned environmental dna is in the order of  <dig> mb. given that the genomic diversity of this environment was previously calculated to be to  <dig> e. coli genome equivalents  by dna/dna reassociation  <cit>  the size of the library was considered sufficient to cover the numerically dominant "haloquadratum" related lineages. pcr screening of the metagenome library revealed eight 16s rrna genes, five of which were highly related to "haloquadratum walsbyi" . of the remaining three, two were related to haloarchaeon csw <dig> . <dig>  and one to the genus halosimplex. fosmids that contained one of the rrna operons of "haloquadratum" , were fully sequenced and compared with the "h. walsbyi" strain hbsq <dig> genome  <cit> . the similarity is very high throughout this fragment indicating how highly conserved this part of the genome is . strain hbsq <dig> was isolated two years before the samples used in this study were obtained. every year the crystallizer ponds are emptied to harvest the salt and then refilled with water from lower salinity ponds. therefore the environmental dna and the strain do not come from the same body of water although the location is the same.

analysis of the library by fosmid end-sequencing
for this work fosmids ends were sequenced using vector primers. we regularly obtained sequences over  <dig> nucleotides and the success rate was acceptable . in total  <dig> individual end sequences were determined with an average size of  <dig> bps, generating ca  <dig>  mb of dna sequence data. given the availability of the complete "h. walsbyi" strain hbsq <dig> genome sequence  <cit> , comparison of the metagenome library was straightforward . one thousand and twenty-nine sequences  with more than 94% nucleotide identity to the hbsq <dig> genome were considered as bona-fide "h. walsbyi" . this range of sequence similarity is commonly observed with groups designated as "species" by other criteria  <cit> . another set of  <dig> sequences with 80% to 94% identity to the hbsq <dig> genome was categorized as "haloquadratum". finally,  <dig> sequences with no similarity to the hbsq <dig> genome on one end of the fosmid insert, but in which the other end showed >80% dna identity with hbsq <dig> were given the "haloquadratum"-scaffold  tag. the majority of these  <dig> sequences have a low gc content, which is characteristic of genes in the sequenced hbsq <dig> genome and which is unlike all other known haloarchaeal and hyperhalophilic bacterial genomes  <cit> . the fosmids depicted in figure  <dig> and indeed of most sequences in the metagenome library  have this unique and defining characteristic.

most of these fosmid inserts had sequences at both ends with high similarity to hbsq <dig>  assuming that fosmid inserts are shorter in length than  <dig> kb and may correspond to identical regions on the hbsq <dig> genome, synteny between the cloned environmental dna fragments and hbsq <dig> could be assessed. we identified  <dig> fosmids in which both ends had hits located at less than  <dig> kb apart  and with >80% dna identity . concatenation of the sequences from these syntenic fosmid inserts would have allowed the reconstruction of more than 92% of the hbsq <dig> chromosome, with an average coverage of  <dig> x . this analysis also identified  <dig> fosmid inserts in which both ends have at least 80% dna identity to hbsq <dig> but which are more than  <dig> kb apart on the hsbq <dig> genome. indeed, the average distance between the corresponding hbsq <dig> sequences was  <dig> kb, indicating that large genomic rearrangements had taken place in the hbsq <dig> genome or the genome from which the fosmid insert came. rearrangments seemed to correlate somewhat with dna divergence since 24%  of the fosmid inserts with at least one end having between 80% and 94% identity with the strain hbsq <dig> were rearranged, compared with only 9%  of those in which both ends had >94% dna identity.

the  <dig> fosmids having similarity to hbsq <dig> at just one end must represent borderline sections in the genomes of the metapopulation where synteny with the sequenced strain is broken. the location of these sequences, plus the sequences from the  <dig> fosmid inserts in which there is greater than  <dig> kb between hbsq <dig> homologs were plotted onto the hbsq <dig> genome . results from this analysis indicate that the distribution of these discontinuities is widespread in the genome, but is by no means random and there may be rearrangement "hot-spots". a gc content plot for the hbsq <dig> genome shows two relatively "choppy" regions  each about  <dig>  mb interspersed with relatively "calm" regions with fewer and smaller peaks. the frequency of the discontinuity events is correlated with larger amplitude variance in the gc content . in particular, a large segment of  <dig> kb starting at position  <dig> kb, contains only  <dig> discontinuities  in spite of being heavily covered in the metagenome library, whereas the contiguous  <dig> kb region, within the first choppy region, contains  <dig> discontinuities . a lack of synteny is also associated with the low level of hbsq genome coverage from the environmental library . this observation is consistent with these regions being present in the sequenced strain but not in many of the environmental lineages. the accessory gene pools of pathogenic bacteria are also found in regions of atypical gc content  <cit> .

taking advantage of the fact that hbsq <dig> has an average gc-content that is nearly 20% lower than all other known hyperhalophiles, we also identified metagenomic sequences as coming from "haloquadratum" by analyzing their gc-content   <cit> . establishing an upper cut-off value of 55%, allowed categorization of  <dig> sequences with no similarity to the hbsq <dig> genome  as most likely belonging to "haloquadratum" lineages. trinucleotide analysis  shows that a clear majority of these "low-gc" sequences possess a "h. waslsbyi"- like sequence signature, supporting our hypothesis that most of these indeed consist of sequences found associated with cells within the "haloquadratum" population. these  <dig> sequences together with the  <dig> sequences previously identified as hq-scaffold must represent the accessory pool for this species in this specific environment since they are not present in the sequenced strain and therefore cannot be essential for its survival and contained only within certain lineages of the environmental diversity of the species. hereafter we will refer to this combined set as the "accessory sequence pool".

it is also noteworthy that we found  <dig> fosmids with high similarity  also had a best amino-acid blast hit to putative proteins in hbsq <dig>  these sequences represent a bit more than 28% of its genome and have an average amino acid identity greater than 91%. most interesting are the sets of end-sequences lacking dna similarity to hbsq <dig> but in the "accessory sequence pool". among the  <dig> such sequences,  <dig>  had best hits to putative "h. walsbyi"  or other haloarchaeal genes,  <dig>  were similar to other archaea or bacteria, and another  <dig>  had no hit in public databases. one hundred and twenty-four of these  <dig> sequences had predicted orfs of  <dig> amino-acids long or longer. a low theoretical pi value, which is characteristic of halophilic proteomes  <cit>  was found for a majority of these predicted orfs, indicating that at least some of them may be translated into functional proteins.

functional category distribution analysis of the  <dig> accessory gene pool sequences, strain hbsq <dig>  "h. walsbyi" fosmid-ends, and "haloquadratum" fosmid-ends, revealed important differences in several categories . indeed, some "core" functional categories are clearly underrepresented in the "accessory sequence pool", such as that of transcription, translation, and energy metabolism. conversely "peripheral" functional categories such as signal transduction and gene regulation are overrepresented in that set, as well as is-encoded transposases, conserved hypothetical proteins and sequences with ill-defined function . unexpectedly a relatively large number of cell-envelope components were also detected in this gene pool.

discussion
during the last few years there has been a dramatic change in the understanding of the dynamics of microbial genomes. the tradition established by the first population genetics studies carried out in the 1980's was to consider that mutation was the driving factor in bacterial adaptation and diversification, as is the case in model metazoan and plant organisms. however, comparative genomics has changed this view, indicating that indeed the main variable that allows adaptation to different niches is the presence of variable gene pools in different strains. these so-called accessory pools are involved in differences in pathogenecity and many other properties that are strain-specific  <cit> . most of the information obtained in this field derives from comparing different isolates from the same designated species. the problem with using single isolates is that there is always a certain bias of isolation and it is difficult to infer how representative such isolates are of their natural populations. this is particularly an issue when dealing with non pathogenic organisms with which there may also be considerable microdiversity in the sample or habitat  <cit> . so far, the most thorough attempt to retrieve information from directly sequencing an environmental dna dominated by one species indicated very little variability in gene content among the lineages present in it  <cit>  although a considerable sexual exchange was detected among lineages within the population.

our study hints to a potentially large gene reservoir in the saltern habitat. the roughly 1/ <dig> of sequences retrieved with high gc values and no similarity to either "haloquadratum" or salinibacter  belong with all probability to other haloarcheal  species present in the crystallizer that had not been detected previously by 16s rdna amplification and sequencing, t-rflp or fish and demonstrate the limitations of these techniques. still approximately 2/ <dig> of the fosmid library most likely belong to "h. walsbyi" or closely related lineages, as shown by the similarity of the 16s rrna genes retrieved from the library, the percent gc and trinucleotide frequency values and, in many cases, the high similarity to the sequenced strain hbsq <dig>  in this sense it is remarkable to observe that nearly identical sequences were found for the two completely sequenced fosmid inserts that contained rrna ribosomal operons. this, together with the virtual retrieval of the near complete hbsq <dig> genome, hints to the permanence of a "h. walsbyi" backbone genome with a high degree of conservation. but it is also apparent from this work that there are other lineages sharing the environment that differ in  synteny  gene content and probably also  pool of paralogous genes. some "choppy" clusters rich in transposable elements found in the hbsq <dig> strain appear to be underrepresented in the population captured in the fosmid library. on the other hand, many genes present in the library also appear to be absent from the sequenced "h. walsbyi" isolate. the architecture of the metagenome would be as depicted in figure  <dig>  the fraction of genes  that is shared by most  the lineages would represent the "core" genome  <cit>  of the species. this core contains the genes that provide essential cell biology functions and in which variation would be deleterious . on the other hand, certain regions at relatively conserved locations of individual genomes contain highly variable sets of genes, which we identify as "accessory". although such genes represent a minority for any specific individual genome  the total number of genes contained within this variable compartment could be very large . the large fluctuations with respect to the average genome gc content  suggest an involvement of is elements and phage related genes in the the evolutionary dynamics of this accessory gene pool.

the salterrn crystallizer studied is barely  <dig> cm deep and no benthic communities are known. still, this environment could offer a variety of microniches. suspended particules could harbor different microbiota, with different nutrional characteristics, as has been demonstated for open-ocean environments  <cit> . diel and seasonal cycles might generate ecological diversity, and the complexity of the nutrient pool in the crystallizers is great. the major nutrient source would be dead and lysed cells of the eukaryotic alga dunaliella, which is the primary producer at lower salinities. full utilization of this complex resource would require either an enormous genome encoding all required metabolic pathways or a diverse pool of lineages each with slightly different degradative properties.

our data suggest that there is indeed a diverse pool of lineages. the enrichment in signal transduction  and gene regulation in the accessory pool  suggests a key role in microadaptation to slightly different niches. transcriptional regulators or signal transduction could produce diversity in the response to environmental change that might optimize resource exploitation under varying conditions. this is particularly remarkable for a non motile organism like "haloquadratum". the production of gas-vesicles must provide some control over cell location in their habitat, but the responses to environmental gradients must be rather limited. less expected but also present among accessory genes were those encoding cell envelope components which might be involved in phage evasion . suggestive as these correlations are, we cannot at the moment discount the possibility that many of the differences in gene content are effectively neutral, and only observable because of a high rate of dna exchange  <cit> .

our results contribute to an appreciation of the problems associated with assembling complete genome of any single uncultured strain in such a complex community of related strains, for example when shotgun strategies are used  <cit> . conserved genes can be identified and conserved regions might be mapped, but lack of synteny and variable gene content in other regions would preclude the scaffolding of any complete genome. thus complete sequencing of the genomes of selected isolates in pure culture remains a valuable and possibly essential adjunct to metagenomic studies such as ours.

CONCLUSIONS
nearly all of the genes in the genome of the sequenced strain "haloquadratum walsbyi"  were recovered from our environmental dna library, and many of our fosmids exhibited synteny with that genome. hqsb <dig> was isolated from the same saltern as our environmental dna samples but two years before.

the pan-genome of this metapopulation in this specific habitat and location contains at least another genome equivalent  in addition to the genome of the sequenced strain

the differential gene content is found associated mostly with regions of atypical gc content and a high frequency of phage/is elements, suggesting an involvement of such elements and horizontal gene transfer in the maintenance of the accessory gene pool. the accessory genes often appear to be involved in regulation and signal transduction, underscoring the importance of these processes in the adaptation of specific lineages to specific heterotrophic microniches in this nutrient rich habitat.
