BACKGROUND
normal  cultured cells derived from living tissue exhibit a limited life span reaching replicative senescence in a non-dividing state  <cit> . each cell division results in the generation and accumulation of various cellular genetic alterations, such as telomere shortening caused by the inability of dna polymerases to fully replicate the ends of linear chromosomes  <cit> . this inability to overcome these alterations ultimately leads to cellular aging. most cells are unable to overcome senescence unless key tumor suppressor pathways are first altered. thus, cellular immortalization has been achieved by genetic alterations which bypass the stages leading to cellular senescence.

spontaneous immortalization is a rare event in human and avian cells, but occurs much more frequently in rodent cells  <cit> . unlike virally or chemically induced tumor cell lines, spontaneously induced, non-transformed cell lines lacking endogenous and exogenous viral genomes are much more useful for studying the conversion to an immortal state and to evaluate the effects of viral infection. traditionally, in the absence of a suitable avian cell line, primary chicken embryo fibroblasts  have been used in virology and vaccine production, although a major disadvantage is the fluctuation of virus titers from lot to lot. thus, there are advantages to using a spontaneously immortalized non-transformed cell line for vaccine production, which provides an unlimited supply of identical cells.

the immortal df- <dig> cef cell line was established spontaneously from line  <dig>  embryos and has been widely used for the propagation of various avian viruses, including avian sarcoma leukosis virus  <cit> , avian leukosis virus  <cit> , marek's disease virus  <cit> , avian influenza virus  <cit> , infectious bursal disease virus  <cit> , and avian metapneumovirus  <cit> . the non-transformed df- <dig> cef cell line has been continuously grown in culture for more than  <dig> passages and does not harbor any known endogenous viruses  <cit> . df- <dig> cells have enhanced growth potential compared to their primary cef counterparts  <cit> . the morphology of df- <dig> cells is that of a typical spindle-shaped fibroblast, but is much smaller than its primary cef counterpart .

various genetic, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of the df- <dig> cell line have been reported. at the chromosomal level, df- <dig> cells display different ploidy lineages and chromosomal rearrangements by maintaining a complex derivative karyotype which may be caused by chromosome fusions in homozygous and heterozygous conditions. in addition the df- <dig> cells contain a greater amount of telomeric sequence repeats per genome compared to normal chicken cells and to a telomerase positive transformed lymphoma cell line  <cit> . chromosome rearrangements and different ploidy thus may influence structural or dosage-related alterations in gene expression. indeed, df- <dig> cells retain various genetic alterations of down-regulated p <dig> function, an up-regulated prb  and e2f <dig> pathway, and elongated telomere length, which are commonly found in immortalized cells  <cit> . compared to the parent line of primary cef cells, df- <dig> cells were shown to transcriptionally increase mitochondrial encoding gene expression and elevated mitochondrial respiratory functions, which supports its rapidly dividing cellular characteristics  <cit> . moreover, cellular antioxidant genes, such as manganese containing superoxide dismutase , copper-zinc containing sod , and catalase were deregulated transcriptionally and functionally in the df- <dig> cell line. these deregulated antioxidant functions may be considered to be responsible for hypersensitivity to oxidative stress shown in df- <dig> cells  <cit> .

the df- <dig> cef cell line is a biologically important spontaneously immortalized cell line that has been utilized by great number of research groups for a host of research topics. due to the diverse utility and the potentially unique genetic characteristics, the df- <dig> cell line  will be subjected to whole genome sequencing within the year .

biologic, virologic and important genetic alterations in immortal df- <dig> cef cells have been reported, however there are no reports concerning genome-wide gene expression profiling of the df- <dig> cells to our knowledge. thus, the major goal of this study was to conduct global gene expression analysis to profile differentially expressed genes in df- <dig> cef cells compared to their primary cef counterpart using a 44k chicken oligo microarray. the results indicate that df- <dig> cells retain cellular characteristics of enhanced cell cycle progression and proliferation, down-regulated cell death pathways, hyperactive mitochondrial functions, and altered cellular morphogenesis.

RESULTS
morphology and growth characteristics of df- <dig> cef cells
immortal df- <dig> cef cells have been growing continuously in culture for a number of years. df- <dig> cells at passage  <dig> morphologically showed typical characteristics of fibroblast cells, but are clearly smaller in size especially regarding cellular projections compared to primary passage  <dig> cef cells . growth rates of df- <dig> cells showed between  <dig>  to  <dig>  population doublings per day  compared to  <dig>  -  <dig>  pd/d of primary cef cell counterpart .

gene expression profile of immortal df- <dig> cef cells
to find transcriptional alterations in df- <dig> cells, genome-wide expression profiling was conducted using rna from primary and immortal df- <dig> cef samples. although the primary cef counterpart cells used in this study  were not the original embryonic cells used for the establishment of df- <dig> cells , comparison of transcriptional alterations by microarray analysis was conducted to understand cellular characteristics of immortal- and rapidly growing df- <dig> cef cells compared to early passage of primary cef cells having limited life-span and a relatively slow proliferation rate. of the 44k probes used in the microarray analysis, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified in df- <dig> cef cells with a  <dig> fold level cutoff that included  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . to validate the microarray results,  <dig> randomly chosen genes from the  <dig> differential expression list were subjected to qpcr along with the gapdh loading control gene. results indicated that increased or decreased expression levels for all genes tested were well-matched in assays between microarray and qpcr analysis . when  <dig> differentially expressed probes were analyzed using ingenuity pathways analysis ,  <dig> were classified as functionally known genes . a list of the  <dig> most up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes in the df- <dig> cells are provided in table  <dig> 

the gene expression levels of  <dig> genes from microarray analysis were confirmed by qpcr. the expression levels were presented by fold changes values in microarray analysis, while, for qpcr, the values were calculated by 2-ΔΔct method, which were comparable to fold changes in the microarray. all values are mean values determined by the calculations from three replicate assays.

fold change  values were indicated by log <dig>  the highly differentially expressed genes were sorted. all genes were matched and verified with unigene function of ncbi database.

the  <dig> up- and down-regulated genes in df- <dig> cells exhibiting the greatest differential expression
the  <dig> most up-regulated genes  are related to functions of cell cycle and proliferation, intracellular trafficking, cytoskeletal arrangement, and host-defense mechanisms against pathogenic infections. in contrast, the  <dig> most down-regulated genes in df- <dig> cells  are associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, homeostasis, cell shape and movement, cellular respiration, and organ development. of these, the up-regulation of osgin <dig>  colec <dig>  and socs <dig> and the down-regulation of st3gal <dig>  ptgs <dig>  and cck in df- <dig> cells appears initially to be incongruous with the rapid growth potential that is characteristic of these cells. although the connections to cellular phenotypes from mrna expression data may not be as strong as expected due to the potential lack of correlation between mrna expression and protein abundance , the highly and dramatically differentially expressed genes may represent correlations between transcripts, protein abundance and the differential abundance of proteins in two different cell types, respectively. thus, further study is needed to reveal the functional roles of these genes in df- <dig> cells.

functional groups of differentially expressed genes
the ipa program generated bioinformatics data sets including functional groups  and gene networks for differentially expressed genes in immortal df- <dig> cef cells. of the biologically functional groups for  <dig> differentially expressed genes, the top  <dig> functional groups are displayed in figure  <dig>  the greatest numbers of genes are mainly categorized into functionalities of cellular growth and proliferation, cell cycle, cellular movement, cancer, genetic disorders, and cell death, suggesting that the transcriptional alterations that occurred in df- <dig> cells are closely related and likely responsible for a great deal of the rapid growth and phenotypic changes in this cell line.

gene networks
gene network analysis, which represents the intermolecular connections among interacting genes based on functional knowledge inputs, was performed on the differentially expressed genes using the ipa program. of various assay settings, the simplest settings  were employed to analyze molecular gene networks in order to facilitate and summarize the connections among the larger number of differentially expressed genes . a discussion of the top five gene networks is provided below and gene information for focus molecules in each network was listed in additional file  <dig> 

functions associated with  <dig> networks are listed. score means the number of network eligible molecules out of differentially expressed genes.

network # <dig> is closely associated with the e2f <dig> and brca <dig>  pathways in cell cycle regulation . likewise, the top functions related to network # <dig> are cell cycle regulation, dna replication, recombination, repair, and cellular assembly and organization. up-regulation of e2f <dig> in immortal cef cell lines including df- <dig>  heart derived- and breast derived cef cells was reported previously together with the genetic alterations for cell cycle regulatory genes, such as the down-regulation of p <dig>  mdm <dig>  p21cip as well as the upregulation of prb, the cyclins , c-fos, c-jun, and bcl <dig>  <cit> . these cell cycle regulatory genes showed a similar expression pattern in the full differential expression list of  <dig> genes. however, with the exception of e2f <dig>  these genes were not recognized by the ipa program. this difference might be the result of the ipa program, which focuses mainly on mammalian gene information and pathways, and does not fully cover chicken gene annotations. it suggests that comparing and contrasting data of both the ipa differential expression list and the manufacturer's differential expression list is more helpful for comprehensively understanding the differential expression datasets.

e2f <dig> is a member of the e2f family of transcription factors that play a crucial role in controlling the cell cycle by association with the tumor suppressor protein, prb . e2f transcription factors are the effectors of the g1/s transition of the cell cycle. when bound to dna, e2f transcription factors exist either as free e2f/dp  heterodimers, or are associated in larger complexes containing members of the retinoblastoma family  and members of the cyclin/cdk protein families. cdks are comprised of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate a number of substrates mainly implicated in cell cycle progression and transcription. association of e2fs with the prb family facilitates active repression through recruitment of histone deacetylases  <cit> . genes directly interacting with e2f <dig> include factors for dna replication   <cit> , dna recombination and repair of double strand breaks   <cit> , and maintenance of genomic stability . brca <dig> is a nuclear phosphoprotein that makes a super complex, denoted as basc , which is associated with tumor suppressors and dna damage repair proteins such as nibrin   <cit> . in network # <dig>  brca <dig> binding proteins, med <dig> , which is a transcription co-factor with tfiid, rad <dig> and bard <dig>  are also up-regulated, suggesting that brca <dig> transcriptional activity may be increased in df- <dig> cef cells. also dna polymerases including pold <dig>  and prim <dig>  were up-regulated in network # <dig>  the up-regulation of all of these genes and complexes make 'teleological sense' with regard to the rapid growth characteristics of df- <dig> cef cells. in addition, atpase related factors including atpb <dig> , abcc <dig> , atp5s , and katna <dig>  were also up-regulated and consistent with the previous report of the hyperactivation of mitochondrial functions and up-regulation of mitochondrial gene expression  <cit> . these results suggest that df- <dig> cef cells may contain cellular systemic alterations to accelerate metabolic energy expenditure. moreover, cellular proliferation inhibitory factors or apoptosis inducing factors, such as mt2a  and arhcef <dig>  were down-regulated in df- <dig> cef cells  <cit>  that again would contribute to the phenotypic expression of rapid growth rate and resistance to senescence that is characteristic of df- <dig> cells.

similar to network # <dig>  the top functions of network # <dig> include dna replication, recombination and repair, cell cycle, and cellular assembly and organization . central in this network are casp <dig> , molecules inducing apoptosis including sfrp <dig>  and trib <dig>  which were all down-regulated. the caspase family are cysteine-aspartic acid proteases which play major roles in the execution phase of cell apoptosis  <cit> . sfrp <dig> acts as soluble modulators of wnt  signaling and suppresses tumor cell growth through the wnt signaling pathway  <cit> . 'however, functional roles of sfrp <dig> in apoptosis related to casp <dig> expression depends on the cell type  <cit> . trib <dig>  which is an atypical protein serine-threonine kinase, is known to coordinate cell proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis during the development of drosophila and xenopus embryos and is involved in apoptosis in mammalian cell lines  <cit> . also, aatf , which suppresses apoptosis induced by oxidation  <cit> , was up-regulated in df- <dig> cef cells. these results generally suggest cell death pathways are suppressed in df- <dig> cells that, in turn, support the immortal and hyperproliferative capability of df- <dig> cells. moreover, in human, gmnn , which negatively regulates dna replication 'licensing'  by preventing the formation of the pre-replicative complex on origins of replication through the physical association with the 'licensing' factor cdt <dig>  <cit> , was cleaved by casp <dig> during apoptosis  <cit> . the suppression of gmnn by sirna knockdown can selectively kill cancer cells  <cit>  and gmnn directly interacts  mcm <dig> , which is an essential factor for the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication  <cit>  in addition to other mcm molecules including mcm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <cit>  in network # <dig>  indicating that gmnn may have an important role in expediting dna replication. other e2f- <dig> transcription targets including tyms , nasp , orc1l , and tpx <dig>  are up-regulated in df- <dig> cells  <cit> . furthermore, direct interactions among highly expressed orc1l, orc6l, orc2l and mcm families, which are components protein complex essential for the initiation of the dna replication in eukaryotic cells, were found in network # <dig>  <cit> . up-regulation of plk <dig> , kif <dig> , and prc <dig>  through the direct interactions among those molecules may facilitate mitosis and cytokinesis at the late phase of the cell cycle in df- <dig> cells  <cit> .

molecules in network # <dig> are involved in cancer, cardiovascular system development and function, and organismal development . glutathione peroxidases  and glutathione s transferases  were downregulated except for gst-o <dig>  this result is consistent with the previous report of higher levels of reactive oxygen species that were produced and accumulated in df- <dig> cef cells possibly due to higher respiratory rates, higher superoxide dismutase and lowered catalase activity, resulting in hypersensitivity to oxidative damage  <cit> . taken together, lower levels of gpxs and gsts may be responsible for higher levels of intracellular oxidative stress and susceptibility to oxidative damage in df- <dig> cells. in contrast to the down-regulation of casp <dig> in network # <dig>  initiator caspases   <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated in df- <dig> cells implicating a more active induction of apoptosis when df- <dig> cells encounter cell damage, such as oxidative stress or pathogenic infections. df- <dig> cells have been utilized as an excellent substrate for the propagation of various viruses, since the cells support high virus titers and generate clear cytopathic effects, such as syncytium formation   <cit> . virus infections usually induce apoptosis during lytic propagation stages. therefore, the up-regulation of apoptosis initiator caspases may play a role during virus infection in df- <dig> cells. in addition, prion protein  and its interacting proteins including ntm , lsamp , and clstn <dig>  were down-regulated in df- <dig> cells. normally, functional cellular prrn is known to promote g1/s cell cycle processing, and has resulted in increasing proliferation of human gastric cancer cells  <cit> , but the higher proliferation capability of df- <dig> cells may not be stimulated by prions and their interacting molecules.

network # <dig> contains molecules involved in molecular transport, tissue morphology, and the cell cycle . in network # <dig>  three subunits of the ndc   <dig> complex, which is a homolog of yeast kinetochore complex component containing ndc <dig>  , spc   <dig>  spc <dig>  and nuf <dig>  and mediates attachment of chromosomes to microtubules, were differentially expressed showing up-regulation of ndc <dig> and spc <dig> and down-regulation of nuf <dig>  the ndc <dig> complex is evolutionarily conserved and contains four subunits spc <dig>  spc <dig>  nuf <dig> and ndc <dig>  in budding yeast, the ndc <dig> complex plays a critical role in establishing the stable kinetochore-microtubule interactions required for chromosome segregation in mitosis  <cit> . of the ndc <dig> subunits, chicken spc <dig> has not been characterized to date. the unbalanced expression of the components in the ndc <dig> complex in df- <dig> cells may lead unstable chromosome segregation, resulting in different ploidy and a complex derivative karyotype caused by chromosomal rearrangements during rapid proliferation cycles  <cit> . several secreting proteins, including il <dig> , fgfbp <dig> , serpine <dig> , vip , and nrg <dig>  are found in network # <dig>  vip and nrg <dig> were up-regulated, while fgfbp <dig>  il <dig> and serpine <dig> were down-regulated. vip is known to increase cyclin d <dig> expression and cell proliferation  <cit> , and nrg <dig>  which is a ligand for epidermal growth factor and its receptor, causes constitutive activation of several signaling pathways, such as the erk1/ <dig>  erk <dig>  and akt routes, which have been linked to cell proliferation  <cit> . serpine <dig>  a.k.a thrombin inhibitor protease nexin  <dig>  has negative effects on myofibroblastic cell growth by regulating pi <dig> kinase-akt pathway  <cit> . the ectopic expression of the il <dig> prodomain in tumor cell lines has triggered growth arrest and apoptosisis  <cit> . with the exception of fgfbp <dig>  differentially expressed secreted proteins in df- <dig> cef cells were closely related to growth promoting activity. factors involving tissue morphology in network # <dig> include egln <dig> , egr <dig> , foxm <dig> , hes <dig> , meox <dig> , nfil <dig> , nrg <dig>  ptgs <dig> , vip, and vipr <dig> . the specific functional roles of differentially expressed genes in the morphogenesis of df- <dig> cells are being further investigated.

finally, molecules in network # <dig> are involved in the cellular assembly and organization, developmental disorders, and skeletal and muscular disorders . network # <dig> was mainly centered around up-regulated src  and down-regulated actin related factors. src, the cellular homolog of the rous sarcoma virus v-src, is a protooncogene and may play a role in cell growth in addition to embryonic development. src is a tyrosine kinase whose enzymatic activity is necessary to induce oncogenic transformation  <cit> . the src interactive molecules including cav <dig> , mtmr <dig> , zp <dig> , ralgapb , afap <dig> , and trpc <dig>  are phosphorylated by src and are considered to improve cellular proliferation, suggesting that differentially expressed src and src-interacting molecules may play important roles for the rapid proliferation of df- <dig> cells. cellular structural proteins such as actinin, cadherin, and catenin, and their interacting molecules including csrp   <dig>  csrp <dig>  cdh <dig> , marcksl <dig> , ctnna <dig> , and tjp <dig>  were down-regulated in df- <dig> cells, suggesting that these factors may be involved in the distinct morphology of df- <dig> cells compared to primary cef cells. factors involved in cellular assembly and organization in network # <dig> include agrn , map <dig> , sgcb , sgcd , and src. proteins functioning in skeletal and muscular disorders in network # <dig> include cdh <dig>  csrp <dig>  ctnna <dig>  map <dig>  ror <dig> , sepn <dig> , sgcb, sgcd, and src and factors related to developmental disorder are marcksl <dig>  sgcb, sgcd, src, and trpc <dig>  specific roles of each of these factors need further investigation.

in summary, global gene expression analysis in this study provides insight into the entire genome-wide alterations in immortal df- <dig> cef cells. bioinformatic analyses suggested that df- <dig> cells are characterized by enhanced molecular mechanisms for cell cycle progression and proliferation, suppressing cell death pathways, altered cellular morphogenesis, and accelerated capacity for molecule transport. in addition to previously known potential genetic alterations, such as elongation of telomere length and deregulation of cell cycle regulatory factors including p <dig>  e2f <dig>  the cdks, and cyclins, which could possibly allow df- <dig> cells to become immortal, one of the new potential regulatory factors suggested in this study is the cellular src  molecule, which is a cellular counter part of viral src  oncoprotein found in rous sarcoma virus. the c-src is generally known as a protooncogene involved in regulating cellular proliferation and the mutant version of c-src will induce transformation. though it is not known whether the c-src gene in df- <dig> cells is mutated or not, the increased expression of c-src in df- <dig> cef cells suggests a contribution to the immortalization of the cell by prolonged activation of growth signal and the anti-apoptotic activity. indeed, we performed functional analysis using small interfering  to target e2f <dig>  brca <dig>  and src, three highly up-regulated and potentially meaningful genes for the rapid growth of df- <dig> cells. as shown in additional file  <dig> a-d, sirna against e2f <dig>  marginally reduced df- <dig> cell growth  compared to the negative control sirna transfection , sirna against brca <dig>  and src  showed only  <dig> - and  <dig>  fold increases of df- <dig> cell population at  <dig> dpt, respectively. the marginal effect of sie2f- <dig> may be due to a possible compensatory effect that other e2f family genes may have on cell proliferation such as shown by e2f <dig> in mouse fibroloblastic cells  <cit> . knock-down approaches for brca <dig> and src showed more significant effects on growth inhibition in df- <dig> cells, similar to the result of the positive control sirna against beta-actin . additional file  <dig> a shows the induction of cdkn2b  by a demethylation chemical . additional file  <dig> b and c reveal the growth inhibitory effects of inducing p15ink4b on rapidly proliferating df- <dig> cells compared to control groups. further cellular, molecular, biochemical characterization of specific factors to modulate cellular characteristics for df- <dig> cells remains for future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated changes in genome-wide gene expression for the immortal df- <dig> cef cell line showing rapid growth potential and chromosomal rearrangement. taken together, the df- <dig> genome sequence, which will be announced in the near future, and the differentially expressed genes characterized here provide transcriptional insights into the regulatory mechanisms for the unique characteristics observed in immortal df- <dig> cef cells.
