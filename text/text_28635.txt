BACKGROUND
blood lipids are transported in the bloodstream of human and animal. they are important indicators for whole body lipid metabolism. the screening tests of blood lipid concentrations of total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  and triglycerides  are used clinically to evaluate the risk for cardiovascular diseases and to give the guidance for prescription of medicine. serum concentrations of blood lipids are highly heritable phenotypes  <cit> . to date, a number of genome-wide association studies  have successfully identified over  <dig> loci associated with one or more blood lipid traits in humans  <cit> . for instance, a gwas in >  <dig>  individuals of european ancestry revealed  <dig> significant loci associated with plasma lipids  <cit> ; a gwas for  <dig> plasma lipoprotein traits identified  <dig> loci associated with plasma lipoprotein size, concentration and cholesterol content in  <dig>  women from the women’s genome health study  <cit> . further investigations of three loci have identified galnt <dig>  <cit> , trib <dig>  <cit> , and sort <dig>  <cit>  as causative genes for blood lipid traits. however, these loci explain only a small proportion of trait variability, suggesting that many determinants remain unexplored.

the pig is an important biomedical model  <cit> . compared to humans, pigs not only have similar lipoproteins but also show similar morphology and biochemical composition in atherosclerosis plaque  <cit> . moreover, the advantages of pig as a biomedical model for blood lipids also include: i. pigs can be raised in a unified and standard condition; ii. large-scale rna samples of liver are easily available for gene expression analysis. recently, a number of quantitative trait loci  have been mapped for porcine blood lipids using the whole genome-linkage analysis. to date,  <dig> qtl for tc,  <dig> for hdl-c,  <dig> for hdl-c/ldl-c,  <dig> for ldl-c, and  <dig> for tg have been reported in the pig qtl database  <cit> . however, no causative gene has been identified for these qtl. the rare ldl receptor  mutations contribute to an autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia in the specific pig strains  <cit> , and apolipoprotein b  mutations are associated with elevated plasma cholesterol and atherosclerosis in pigs in relation to atherosclerosis  <cit> . but none of them seems to be the causal mutation but probably represent closely linked polymorphisms to the qtl of serum cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations in a half-sib duroc pig population  <cit> .

the gwas is a powerful tool to identify genomic regions affecting phenotypic traits but not efficient for identifying causative mutations  <cit> . the application of global gene expression analysis has provided a wealth of data relevant to complex traits. for example, ponsuksili et al. identified  <dig> genes with fatness-associated expression in porcine liver and mapped their expression quantitative trait loci   <cit> . more recently, a number of studies have shown that an integrative analysis of gwas, eqtl and bionetwork can facilitate the identification of causative mutations leading to changes of phenotypes  <cit> , for instance, schadt et al. identified sort <dig> and celsr <dig> as candidate susceptibility genes for ldl-c using the integrative approach  <cit> . wimmer et al. characterized ahnak, slc3a <dig> and map4k <dig> as candidate genes for meat drop loss by integrating data of gene expression, eqtl and phenotypic qtl  <cit> .

in this study, a gwas for porcine blood lipid traits was conducted in two populations including a white duroc × erhualian f <dig> intercross and a chinese synthesized line . genome-wide gene expression and quantitative trait transcript  analyses as well as eqtl mapping were also performed to facilitate the identification of candidate genes for these traits. this study provides useful information for the genetic architecture of blood lipids and for human cardiovascular diseases.

methods
experimental populations
all samples in this study were from the white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population and sutai pigs. the white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population was constructed as described previously  <cit> . in brief,  <dig> white duroc boars and  <dig> erhualian sows were mated to produce f <dig> animals, and then 9 f <dig> sires and 59 f <dig> dams were randomly intercrossed, avoiding full-sib mating, to generate  <dig>  f <dig> individuals. sutai pigs were synthetized from duroc × erhualian crossing through selection of  <dig> generations. a total of  <dig> sutai pigs from  <dig> boar families were used in this study. the animals were raised in a standard indoor condition with natural lighting and were fed three times a day using the feed containing 16% of crude protein, 3100 kj of digestible energy, and  <dig> % of lysine. water was available ad libitum from nipple drinkers. these animals were slaughtered at 240 ± 3 days after fasting but water-free overnight . all samples were collected according to the guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals established by the ministry of agriculture of china. animal care and use committee  in jiangxi agricultural university specifically approved this study.

phenotype recording
blood samples were collected from the major artery serum vessels near the heart when the animals were exsanguinated. after coagulation at room temperature, the clots were centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°c for 20 min to separate serums. all serum samples were then stored at -80°c until utilized. ldl-c, hdl-c, tg and tc levels for 760 f <dig> animals  and  <dig> sutai pigs  were measured by direct assay with diagnostic kits of determiner-l ldl-c, determiner-l hdl-c, determiner-l tcii and determiner-c tg , respectively, following the manufacturer’s instructions. all measurements were performed in an au <dig> automatic biochemistry analyzer  at the first affiliated hospital of nanchang university.

rna extraction
liver samples were harvested from 497 f <dig> animals for rna isolation within  <dig> min after slaughter. the tissues were put into the sterile and frozen cryopreservation tubes and dipped into liquid nitrogen, and then conserved in -80°c ultra freezer until rna extraction. total rna was isolated with trizol  following the manufacture’s instruction. the residual dna was cleared away from total rna with rnase-free dnase i  for 30 min at 37°c. the quality of total rna was assessed by a  <dig> bioanalyzer  and agarose gel electrophoresis.

snp genotyping and gwas analysis
all animals were genotyped using porcine snp <dig> beadchips according to the infinium hd assay ultra protocol . the positions of all  <dig>  snps from the porcine snp <dig> beadchip on the current pig genome assembly  were retrieved from the nrsp- <dig> community data repository  <cit> . the quality control  of genotypes was performed with genabel procedure in r. the snps with call rate < 95%, or minor allele frequency < 5%, or hardy weinberg equilibrium  p-value < 5 × 10- <dig>  or the x-linked snps that were likely to be autosomal  were excluded from further analysis. finally, total  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps passed the quality control in the white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population and the sutai pigs, respectively.

the associations of the filtered snps with serum lipid levels were evaluated using a mixed model based on the score test approach  <cit> . the model included a random polygenic effect for which the variance-covariance matrix was proportional to genome-wide identity-by-state. the model equation is: y = xb + sα + zu + e, where y is the vector of phenotypes, b is the vector of fixed effects including sex and batch, α is the vector of the snp substitution effect and u is the random additive genetic effects with u ~ n , where g is the genomic relationship matrix that was constructed based on snp markers, and σα <dig> is the polygenetic additive variance. e is a vector of residual errors with a distribution of n , where i is the identity matrix and σe <dig> is the residual variance. x, s and z are the incidence matrices for b, α and u. the analysis was conducted by mmscore function with genabel in r package. bonferroni correction was used to adjust the multiple tests. a conservative threshold of p <  <dig> /snp number was applied for genome-wide significance, and 1/snp number was set as suggestive significance. quantile-quantile  plots and manhattan plots were drawn using the corresponding p values by r package. we calculated the phenotypic variations explained by the top significant snps using /v reduce, where v full and v reduce are residual variances of the models for association analysis with and without snp term, respectively. we also searched candidate genes with functional relevance to serum lipids or lipid metabolism in an interval of  <dig>  mb centered at the top snp at each significant locus.

qtt analysis and eqtl mapping
digital gene expression  analyses of genome-wide transcripts were performed on 497 f <dig> liver samples as described previously  <cit> . in brief, mrna was isolated from total rna with the magnetic oligo  beads . using the mrna attached to the bead as a template, double-stranded cdna was synthesized with oligo-d  primers, and then digested with restriction enzymes nla iii and mme i . the digested-cdna was ligated to illumina specific adapters  <dig> and  <dig>  polymerase chain reaction  was performed to enrich the cdna library with two primers that annealed to the ends of the adapters. after purification and denaturation, the single chain molecules of each cdna library were loaded onto the flowcell and sequenced on a ga ii sequencer .

tag data sets were analyzed according to the bgi bioinformatics protocols for digital gene expression. briefly, the raw tags were firstly filtered to produce the clean tag data. to map the clean tags to reference transcript sets or to the pig reference genome, the reference transcript sets were downloaded from the database of pede  <cit>  and pig unigene in ncbi  <cit> . the redundant transcripts which overlapped between the two databases were discarded. the virtual libraries containing all the possible  <dig> base-length sequences of these reference transcripts next to an nla iii restriction site were created using in-house perl scripts. the clean tag sequences were then mapped using soap <dig> that allowed up to one mismatches in 21-bp tag sequences  <cit> . the expression profile of each transcript was defined as the number of clean tags that could be uniquely mapped to the reference transcript sequence. then, the expression levels were normalized to tpm .

the gene expression profiles and phenotypic data were further adjusted for gender, batch and kinship using a robust linear regression model. associations of gene expression level with serum blood lipid concentrations were evaluated with spearman coefficient by r software. to adjust the multiple tests, a conservative p <  <dig>  was set as threshold. eqtl mapping was performed for those trait-correlated transcripts using mixed linear model implemented by mmscore function of genabel in r package. sex and batch were considered as fixed effects, the genetic co-variances among samples were also taken into account by fitting kinship matrix derived from genotypes of whole-genome snp markers. a bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the multiple tests. all the above mentioned analyses were carried out with r package.

RESULTS
the phenotypic characteristics of qualified samples in the two experimental populations are summarized in table  <dig>  both populations had comparably average values of serum lipid contents. we estimated the narrow-sense heritability  for each of the  <dig> serum lipid traits in the two pig populations. a medium to high h <dig>  was observed for these traits, suggesting considerable genetic contribution to serum lipid contents in pigs .table  <dig>

a total of  <dig> snps in  <dig> chromosomal regions were associated with serum tc levels, including  <dig> snps at ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb  and the snp alga <dig> at ssc5:  <dig> ,340 bp . the other  <dig> snps can’t be assigned to the current pig genome assembly  <dig> . twelve snps in  <dig> chromosomal regions were associated with hdl-c/ldl-c ratios. nine out of  <dig> snps are located at ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb including marc <dig> whose association achieved the genome-wide significance level . significant association with hdl-c/ldl-c was also observed for snp alga <dig> at ssc1:  <dig> ,424 bp . only two snps m1ga <dig> and marc <dig> at ssc5:  <dig> ,651 bp and  <dig> ,866 bp were significantly associated with tg .

quantitative trait transcripts and eqtl for blood lipids
to detect the genes whose expressions were associated with phenotypes of blood lipids, the expression levels of genome-wide transcripts in livers were determined by tag based rna-seq for 497 f <dig> animals. we obtained an average of  <dig>  million clean tags for each animal. these clean tags were mapped to  <dig>  pig transcripts. the expression data were normalized for each sample to obtain gene expression levels, and then were adjusted for gender, batch and kinship. total  <dig>  transcripts expressed in less than  <dig> animals  were discarded from further analysis. we used regression models to identify transcripts that were associated with each trait of blood lipids. at a significance threshold of p < 5 × 10- <dig>  we found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts whose expression levels were associated with tc, hdl-c, tg and ldl-c, respectively . the correlation coefficients ranged | <dig> - <dig> |. total  <dig> transcripts were positively correlated with phenotypes and  <dig> were negatively correlated with phenotypes. there were  <dig> transcripts associated with more than one phenotype.table  <dig> 
the number of transcripts that correlated with blood lipid traits and their characteristics of eqtl mapping




to link eqtl to a phenotype of blood lipids, we focused on those transcripts that had trait-associated expression and performed gwas using  <dig>  snps. at a significance threshold of p < 1 × 10- <dig>   <dig> eqtl were mapped for  <dig> transcripts. the eqtl number for each transcript ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  no eqtl was identified for total  <dig> transcripts with trait-associated expressions. the identified eqtl comprised of  <dig> cis-eqtl , and  <dig> trans-eqtl, those that mapped elsewhere in the genome . the acting ways of  <dig> eqtl were unknown because the locations of either the snp markers or the transcripts can not be unambiguously mapped to the current reference genome assembly .

to characterize candidate genes for blood lipids, we integratively analyzed the data of gwas, qtt and eqtl in the white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population. the genes showing concordant association signals of gwas, qtt and eqtl are promising candidate genes. as a result, only one transcript of gnl|ug|ssc#s <dig> encoding a hypothetical protein loc <dig> on ssc2:  <dig>  mb for ldl-c satisfied this criterion . unfortunately, this transcript is poorly annotated in the current porcine genome assembly .

discussion
to our knowledge, this study represents the first effort to identify genetic loci for serum lipids using a gwas approach in pigs. we totally identified  <dig> snps that were significantly associated with ldl-c, tc, tg and the ratio of hdl-c/ldl-c in two experimental populations. the genomic loci of ssc2:  <dig>  ~  <dig>  mb, ssc2:  <dig>  ~  <dig>  mb, ssc6:  <dig>  ~  <dig>  mb and ssc5:  <dig>  mb were firstly identified to harbor the ldl-c associated snps. the most prominent locus was detected on ssc <dig> for ldl-c and tc in the white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population and on ssc <dig> for ldl-c and tc in the sutai pigs. for several regions, such as ssc1:  <dig>  mb, ssc4:  <dig>  mb and ssc5:  <dig>  mb, only one snp at each locus achieved the significance level . hence, the possibility of false positive result can not be excluded.

the snp effects at ssc1:  <dig>  mb for hdl-c/ldl-c, ssc1:  <dig>  mb for tc and ldl-c, ssc3:  <dig> - <dig>  mb for tc, ldl-c and hdl-c/ldl-c, ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb for tc, ldl-c and hdl-c/ldl-c, and ssc4:  <dig>  mb for tg overlapped with the previously reported qtl for blood lipids in a white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population, a commercial duroc line and a duroc × pietrain f <dig> population  <cit> . however, the significant loci identified here were not well consistent with our previous qtl mapping results in the same f <dig> population  <cit> . for instance, the most prominent locus on ssc <dig> for ldl-c and tc was not identified by our previous qtl mapping. this explanation could be that: . there is an assumption that the qtl alleles are alternatively fixed in the founder breeds in the composite interval qtl mapping  <cit> . however, the gwas were conducted without this priori assumption. so gwas can detect loci at which alleles are segregating in founder animals; . only additive effect was considered in the model of gwas. however, both additive and dominant effects were included in the qtl mapping model; . in the qtl mapping, the detected qtl was fixed as the genetic background for next round qtl identification but no conditional analysis was performed in the present gwas. . the marker density  is much lower in the qtl mapping compared to the gwas.

except that the snps at ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb had significant associations with ldl-c in both f <dig> and sutai populations, it was unexpected to observe distinct associations for tc, tg and hdl-c/ldl-c in sutai and f <dig> pigs. for example, the significant association of the snp at ssc3:  <dig> ,847 bp with ldl-c and tc in the white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population was not repeated in the sutai pigs. although the f <dig> and sutai populations were originated from the same founder breeds of duroc and erhualian, the principle component analysis showed a clear divergence of the two populations . the different association profiles in the two populations could be a result of population heterogeneity.

we found that some snps were associated with multiple blood lipid traits. for examples, three snps at ssc3:  <dig> - <dig>  mb region were significantly related to ldl-c, tc and hdl-c/ldl-c in the white duroc × erhualian f <dig> resource population; and the snps harboring at ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb were associated with ldl-c, tc and hdl-c/ldl-c in the sutai pigs. these qtl tend to be caused by a common variant with pleiotropic effects.

the chromosomal region of ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb contained the most numbers  of genome-wide significant snps associated with ldl-c in the sutai pigs . to determine whether this result was caused by linkage disequilibrium  between snps or by multiple causative genes within this region, we reconstructed haplotypes corresponding to these significant snps in the sutai pigs. we found that all snps resided in  <dig> haplotype blocks . furthermore, two internal regions  did not harbor any significant snps . altogether, we assume that this chromosomal region contain multiple qtl  for ldl-c. in humans, the homologous regions contain several candidate genes including ldlr, smarca <dig> and hmgcr related to ldl-c  <cit> .

the phenotypic variance explained by the top snps was larger than that by the most cases of identified snps in human studies  <cit> . the similar situation was also reported in dogs  <cit> . the possible explanations should be that:  the experimental population had the small effective population size. the f <dig> population used in this study was derived from two divergent pig breeds of  <dig> white duroc boars and  <dig> chinese erhualian sows.  the environment factors could be well controlled as all experimental pigs were managed in the uniform living conditions with the same diets.  as for the sutai population, the moderate sample size likely caused the inflated phenotypic variance accounted for by the snps  <cit> .

we searched candidate genes with functional relevance to serum lipids or lipid metabolism in an interval of  <dig>  mb centered at the top snp at each significant locus. the large interval was adopted as high ld extents were expected in the current experimental populations. a number of candidate genes for human blood lipids were also evidenced in this study . apob, a candidate gene for ldl-c and tc in humans  <cit>  is located at ssc3:  <dig> - <dig>  mp where significant associations with ldl-c and tc were observed in this study. smarca <dig> and ldlr are candidates for ldl-c and tc in humans  <cit> , and their pig homologous regions were also identified snps that were associated with ldl-c and tc. other candidate genes, such as hmgcr on chromosome  <dig>  for tc and ldl-c, and lipg on hsa <dig> for ldl-c and hdl-c  <cit> , correspond to ssc2:  <dig>  mb and ssc1:  <dig>  mb for ldl-c and hdl-c/ldl-c, respectively . besides, we identified some interesting candidate genes on the basis of knock-out mice data. for instance, ssc2:  <dig>  mb for tc encompasses the slc27a <dig> gene. slc27a <dig> knock-out mice show abnormal lipid and triglyceride levels  <cit> . other potential candidate genes, such as gna <dig>  abca <dig>  csf <dig>  cers <dig>  sirt <dig> and scp <dig>  reside in the genomic regions related to tc, ldl-c, hdl-c/ldl-c and tg in this study . these genes are associated with circulating triglyceride level   <cit> , circulating total cholesterol and hdl-c level   <cit> , abnormal lipid homeostasis   <cit> , and circulating ldl-c level   <cit>  in knock-out mice. no apparent candidate gene was found in the genomic loci of ssc1:  <dig>  mb and ssc5:  <dig>  mb. however, as mentioned above, false positive finding can not be excluded for the regions.

to characterize more promising candidate genes, the correlations of gene expression profiles with blood lipid traits were evaluated using porcine liver samples as liver is a metabolically active organ and is critical to blood lipid metabolism. we detected functional candidate genes for these traits by exploiting phenotype-correlated expression. some genes with trait-correlated expression in pigs appear to be the candidate genes for blood lipids in humans and mice. for examples, the expression levels of cyp8b <dig>  scd and tlr <dig> in liver were significantly correlated with ldl-c in this study . in mice, these genes respond to the abnormal circulating cholesterol level . fasn, ppp1r3b, cebpb, pck <dig>  apoa <dig>  thrsp and alms <dig> are associated with the decreased circulating triglyceride level in knock-out mice  <cit> . the expression levels of these genes were correlated with tg in this study . irs <dig>  hif1an, crp, sptlc <dig>  hsd11b <dig>  soat <dig> and sik <dig> have been reported to associate with circulating hdl-c level in knock-out mice . their expressions were associated with hdl-c in pigs in this study .

eqtl were identified for about  <dig> % of trait-correlated transcripts. consistent with the finding in ponsuksili et al., the proportion of trans-eqtl  was higher than that of cis-eqtl   <cit> . in the gwas studies in humans and mice, 10-15% of the top associated snps have affected a known eqtl  <cit> . it has been reported that trait-associated snps are more likely to be eqtls  <cit> . however, we found only one example  of the concordant location of eqtl, pqtl and qtt. the possible reasons for the discrepancy could be:  the poor annotation of current pig genome-assembly. in this study, only  <dig> % of transcripts corresponding to  <dig> % of clean tags can be annotated to a known gene, and about  <dig> % of trait-associated transcripts can’t be placed to the current pig genome-assembly ;  a considerable proportion of structural mutations rather than regulatory mutations in responsible genes contribute to blood lipids. for instance, protein-altering variants in apob and ldlr cause phenotypic variation in human blood lipids  <cit> ; and  compared to human studies, our sample sizes are small and thereby lead to the failure detection of qtl with small effects, which may harbor the eqtl for trait-related transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study on identifying the genomic regions associated with blood lipids by an integrative analysis of gwas, qtt and eqtl mapping in pigs. we firstly reported  <dig> novel genomic loci for porcine ldl-c level. several chromosomal regions such as ssc2:  <dig> - <dig>  mb and ssc3:  <dig> - <dig>  mb are worthwhile for further fine-mapping and identifying the causative mutations for ldl-c and tc. moreover, many genomic regions previously identified in humans and mice have been replicated here. a list of human or mice candidate genes were also evidenced in this study. this study would benefit the identification of causative genes for blood lipid traits and also gives useful information for studies of human cardiovascular diseases.
