BACKGROUND
whole-genome duplications provide the genetic material for evolutionary innovation. thinking about the evolutionary force behind the emergence of gene duplications goes back to ohno  <cit> , who stated that "natural selection merely modified while redundancy created". since then, comparisons between whole-genome sequences have provided incontrovertible evidence that several plant genomes have undergone multiple ancient polyploidization events during their evolution. these include arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , grape  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . while polyploidization is generally followed by massive gene silencing and elimination of duplicated genes  <cit> , the evolutionary novelty arises by the selective retention of duplicated genes across gene classes  <cit>  leading to specialization  <cit>  and changes in gene expression among gene pairs  <cit> .

today, it is commonly accepted that segmental gene duplications present within the rice genome originated from a single whole-genome duplication event  in a common ancestor at around  <dig> million years before the divergence of many cereal crops, including rice, sorghum, the triticeae and maize  <cit> . while the different numbers of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> duplicated blocks in the rice genome suggested by three wgd studies in rice  <cit>  depend on the chosen analytical approach or the criteria that define duplicated blocks, actual differences do exist in the extent of these duplicated segments among rice chromosomes. for example, a single duplicated block between os <dig> and os <dig> involving together  <dig>  mb of the rice genome was identified in the third study  <cit> , while two duplicated segments covering  <dig>  mb over both arms of the same chromosomes were found in the second study  <cit> . divergent conclusions have also been reached concerning which rice chromosomes were involved in genome duplications. the third study  <cit>  failed to detect the duplications between rice os <dig> and os <dig> as well as between os <dig> and os <dig> that were detected by both other studies. precise delimitation of individual duplications at base pair-level was only considered in a single study  <cit>  based on the assembly of the oryza sativa ssp. indica whole genome shotgun sequence information. this dataset, however, showed considerable differences in the position of corresponding genes when compared to the oryza sativa ssp. japonica assembly, mainly because of differences in the intergenic regions contributing to 28% misalignment rate between both genomes  <cit> .

apart from these ambiguities, the nearly complete genomic sequence for the japonica rice genome and the increased availability of genomic resources for other grass species now enables a more detailed understanding of the evolution of grass genomes. while initial studies based on the comparison of rflp maps uncovered colinear relationship of genes between rice and other grass species  <cit> , detail was generally limited by the paucity of mapped, sequence-based markers. the development of est-derived genetic markers and subsequent saturation of genetic maps has both extended and refined the 'grass genome model' including the relationship between rice and barley  <cit> . given the observed conservation of synteny among rice and the triticeae, the existence of shared genome duplications has been reported in a number of studies  <cit> .

taking advantage of a comprehensive genetic map of barley comprising  <dig> est-derived markers and the availability of a well annotated and curated sequence of the genome of oryza sativa ssp. japonica rice, the objectives of this study were  to revise and refine the rice wgd event, which is shared by all members of the grass family,  to review barley-rice colinearity using an expanded set of mapped barley genes, and  to detect, locate and analyze genome-wide remnants of the wgd in the barley genome.

RESULTS
fine-scale analysis of the rice whole-genome duplication
the availability of the complete genomic sequence of rice  provides a reference dataset to study the wgd event shared by all cereals  <cit>  as it provides the most detailed foot-print of the wgd that shaped the ancestral grass genome. relating an increased understanding of the barley genome to that of rice should therefore enable us to identify shared duplicated segments that originate from their last common ancestor and that remain in the barley genome.

based on release  <dig>  of the japonica rice annotation consisting of  <dig> gene models from  <dig> predicted genes, we performed an all-versus-all sequence comparison . bearing in mind that ongoing local gene duplications in rice are common  <cit> , several filtering steps were applied in order to identify rice gene pairs that originated from the wgd. local gene duplications can potentially affect our ability to determinate precisely both the wgd in the rice genome sequence and barley – rice genome colinearity. they appear either as local tandem copies or, presumably as a result of undefined translocation events, randomly distributed throughout the rice genome where they form a 'background' of homologous genes  <cit> . we observed that 82% of the identified homologs of a query gene that were found on the same rice chromosome were located at a maximum distance of  <dig> mb. this was taken as a strong indication that they originated from local gene duplication. using  <dig> mb as a cutoff, we identified  <dig> locally duplicated rice genes , spread ubiquitously across all rice chromosomes, but excluding the centromeric regions . in order to distinguish these 'background' duplications from those originating from the wgd, we  a priori excluded genes and their homologs from the analysis whenever they occurred at more than  <dig> distinct places  in the rice genome sequence and  determined whether duplicated genes were arranged colinearly within any corresponding sister segments by applying three quality parameters: gene pair density weight >  <dig>  maximum distance between two neighboring gene pairs =  <dig> kb, minimum number of gene pairs =  <dig> . statistical significance of observed segmental duplications was tested subsequently by the one-sided fisher's exact test  and the assignment step was cross-checked by inspecting dot-plots . background duplications accounted for  <dig> gene homologs in rice. similar pairwise synonymous substitution rate distributions for gene pairs classified as local duplications  and background duplications  suggested a common time of origin and likely similar evolutionary mechanisms for both types.

after applying the above filtering steps,  <dig>  genes were determined as being segmentally duplicated genes and were organized in almost perfect colinearity between their respective rice chromosomes. they could be assigned to  <dig> pairs of genomic segments covering  <dig> mb  of the rice genome . duplicated segments were distributed across all  <dig> chromosomes, except their centromeric regions. this is opposed to the distribution of transposable element-related  genes, which were preferably located at the centromeres . duplicated segments involved 57%  to 85%  of their respective chromosome sizes . the overall genomic regions for which traces of wgd could be detected included  <dig> annotated rice genes  or 70% of the rice transcriptome. that implies that for 89% of the genes located within such duplicated regions a corresponding paralog could not be detected. the ratio of segmentally duplicated to the total number of genes observed among duplicated chromosomal segments ranged from  <dig> %  to 23% , and varied within sub-domains of individual duplicated blocks . to examine position-specific patterns in the frequency ratio of segmentally duplicated versus total number of genes in more detail, the ratios were computed for physical bins of  <dig> mb. typically, higher ratios were found in the terminal bins  dropping towards the centromeres . it should be noted that wgd-derived paralog retention ratios are possibly underestimated due to the emergence of additional gene copies through local gene duplications or transposition events that occurred after the wgd in rice and presumably affected all duplicated segments without bias .

segment pair os11_12_ <dig> located on rice chromosomes os <dig>  and os <dig>  differed from all other duplicated segments by having higher ratios of 19% and 30% duplicated genes, respectively. a significantly lower mean ks of  <dig>  was characteristic of this segment pair compared to all other nine duplicated blocks that exceeded a size of  <dig> mb and suggested a more recent origin . more specifically, 60%  of all gene pairs in this region had ks ratios smaller than  <dig>  resulting in a right-skewed ks distribution . the  <dig> mb-bin analysis showed that the first  <dig> mb-bin of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contributed significantly to the ks ratio difference observed for the other wgd derived chromosomal segment pairs. here, the ratio of duplicated genes was as high as 65% and 70%, respectively .

synteny between barley and rice – update
barley-rice synteny was reassessed by comparing a high-density genetic map of barley comprising  <dig> est sequences with the annotated tigr rice genome assembly  <dig>  barley-rice homologs were identified by sequence similarity comparison  of the mapped barley est sequences against all the rice cds. in total,  <dig>  of the barley ests showed sequence homology with at least one rice cds. est sequences with homology to more than  <dig> non-locally duplicated rice genes were excluded from the analysis, leaving  <dig>  ests for further analysis. this step substantially reduced the 'background' that was not related to barley-rice synteny and was similar to the approach taken to filter background duplications within the rice genome. the genetic map position of each barley est was plotted against the physical location of the highest blastn-scoring rice homolog, which was considered the corresponding rice ortholog. segments of the barley and rice genomes exhibiting conserved synteny were defined after visual inspection of the corresponding x-y plots allowing for small discrepancies of  <dig> cm from the colinear ordering of putative orthologs  to account for the limited resolution of the genetic barley consensus map .

in total,  <dig>  barley ests followed a colinear distribution with their corresponding rice homologs . these were organized into  <dig> segments , which we refer to as orthologous genomic regions. shared synteny between both genomes spanned  <dig> cm  of the barley genetic map and  <dig> mb  of the rice genome, respectively. no overlap between any two distinct regions of the barley genome to a single orthologous region in the rice genome and vice versa could be observed. provided that our barley genetic map is sufficiently saturated with mapped ests, these findings imply that no additional subsequent large segmental duplication occurred after divergence of both species from their common ancestor.

small genetic map intervals at proximal regions of barley chromosomes corresponded to relatively large physical intervals in rice and can be recognized by the sigmoidal shape in the x-y plots of orthologous gene positions in barley and rice . for instance, a physical distance of almost  <dig> mb of rice chromosome os <dig>  corresponded to a small interval of barley hv6h at approximately  <dig> –  <dig> cm. on the extreme, both ends of rice chromosome os <dig> shared synteny with two regions of barley chromosome hv3h that were connected by cosegregating est markers at ~ <dig> cm. this low-recombining region that could not be resolved on the barley genetic map corresponded to the central  <dig>  mb –  <dig>  mb interval of rice os <dig>  similarly, rice chromosomes os <dig>  os <dig> and os <dig> displayed synteny solely to the low-recombining regions of barley chromosomes hv7h, hv1h, and hv4h . this is in agreement with previously identified decreased recombination rates for proximal regions of barley chromosomes that often included centromeres  <cit> .

the distribution of orthologs along the respective chromosomes of the barley genetic map and the rice genome sequence was biased. rice orthologs of mapped barley ests were preferentially located at the ends of all rice chromosomes and contributed to more than 4% of all rice genes located in these regions . establishing such a trend in the barley genome was difficult to achieve based on the availability of only a genetic map, because the exact physical dimensions of the low-recombining regions are difficult to determine and almost certainly explain the slightly higher ratio of syntenic barley ests versus all mapped ests in low-recombining regions .

shared patterns of whole-genome duplication between barley and rice
we observed widespread conservation of synteny between mapped barley ests and regions of the rice genome that were part of the rice wgd  providing indirect evidence for the wgd also having occurred in a common ancestor. the available integrated barley genetic map comprising  <dig> est sequences was not sufficiently dense to detect barley segmental genome duplications directly based on the sequence similarity of these mapped ests even at low blastn stringency . this was most likely due to the small number of paralogous gene pairs among the mapped barley ests and reflected in the fact that less than 10% of the rice genes effectively uncovered the rice wgd.

to obtain a genome-wide picture of the shared wgd pattern among barley and rice, we therefore took an indirect approach. we combined the fine-scale synteny data obtained for barley and rice and the bp-level coordinates of the rice wgd segments to precisely determine the shared ancestral duplications between barley and rice at a whole-genome level. because of the chosen approach, shared ancestral duplicated blocks  as observed in this study were restricted to the boundaries of duplicated segments in rice.

seven out of the  <dig> largest duplicated segments in rice shared synteny with barley and thus seven ad's could be identified . these corresponded to  <dig>  of the  <dig> mapped barley est markers and covered  <dig> cm  of the barley genetic map and  <dig> mb  of the rice genome. the number of identified orthologs corresponding to individual ad's ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a bias in the number of identified orthologs among the two paralogous segments of a single ad was observed with ratios ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   for ad_ <dig> and ad_ <dig>  respectively . for ad_ <dig> between rice chromosomes os <dig> and os <dig>  the highest number of orthologous barley-rice gene pairs could be determined . this included  <dig> barley est sequences mapped to barley hv1h  and  <dig> of hv3h . this duplicated rice segment was the largest of five segmental duplications between os <dig> and os <dig> covering  <dig> duplicated gene pairs indicated by grey connecting lines .

for more than 1/ <dig> of all barley ests located in the seven ad's, 'second-best' rice homologs  could be identified in addition to 'best' rice homologs  . for almost all barley ests, both 'best' and 'second-best' rice homologs had been previously identified as paralogs in rice. for all ad's , the distribution of 'best' and 'second-best' rice homologs of barley ests observed in the corresponding duplicated segments in rice was significantly different from random . rare exceptions from this distribution were systematically analyzed for ad_ <dig> . here, four 'best' homologs  were observed within the corresponding paralogous rice segments and five 'second-best' homologs  within the corresponding orthologous rice segments . three possible reasons could explain these observations. first, for two barley est-derived snp markers , only a single homolog could be found in the rice genome and probably deletion of the corresponding orthologs after species divergence left their paralogs as 'best' homologs. second, for rflp marker gbr <dig>  assignment of the orthologous and paralogous rice homologs was supported by the significant difference in sequence homology . since this gene was mapped by rflp hybridization  <cit> , the mapped polymorphic dna fragment of this multicopy probe most likely corresponded to a paralogous locus on hv1h. third, and in all other cases, the underlying barley est was homologous to members of gene families, which were distributed across the rice genome.

two hypothetical additional ad's were found for which less than  <dig> barley ests were syntenic to one of the duplicated segments in rice. in the first, shared synteny between hv5h and os <dig> was supported by  <dig> barley ests  but only by  <dig> ests from hv2h  to the corresponding duplicated segment on rice os <dig> . the second putative ad involved rice and barley chromosomes os <dig> – os <dig> and hv4h – hv5h. as the relationships between hv4h – os <dig>  and hv5h – os <dig>  were characterized by only  <dig> and  <dig> markers respectively, we consider that stronger support is required to strengthen the existence of this shared duplication.

analysis of synonymous substitution rates of rice genome duplications and barley-rice ancestral duplicated blocks
we assessed, at genome scale, the time of origin of duplicated segments in rice for the ten largest segments  for which sufficient data was available to analyze the distribution of pairwise synonymous substitution rates  among corresponding duplicated genes. duplicated genes of nine out of these ten segments had equivalent ks distributions with similar median values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the means of those ks distributions did not differ significantly  and resulted in a unimodal distribution with a single peak between  <dig>  and  <dig>   when plotted together in a single histogram .

synonymous substitution rates of putative orthologs between barley and rice within ad's differed significantly from all distributions that were obtained for the different types of rice duplications . a peak of the ks distribution between  <dig>  and  <dig>   indicated that barley-rice orthologs were evolutionary younger than all segmental duplications in rice originating from wgd. however, they were older than the paralogs of the segmental duplication between chromosomes os <dig> and os <dig> . the ks distribution of putative paralogs between barley and rice with respect to ancestral duplications, was congruent  with the distribution of synonymous substitution rates of the segmentally duplicated gene pairs .

traces of common and independent genome evolution within barley and rice
the distribution of segmental duplications within the rice genome uncovered a complex pattern of chromosomal rearrangements, which involved many if not all rice chromosomes as a consequence of diploidization after wgd in the ancestor genome. on the contrary, synteny to barley chromosomes could be detected for large segments or even complete rice chromosomes and was not restricted to boundaries of duplicated segments in rice. this observation suggested that major genome reorganizations took place after the wgd, but still before the barley-rice divergence. for instance, barley hv6h shared synteny over the entire length of rice os <dig>  and only os <dig>  whereas rice chromosome os <dig> consisted of segments that were duplicated on rice os <dig> and os <dig>  respectively. additional examples could be found for hv3h/os <dig> and hv7h/os <dig> .

based on the gross picture of synteny among barley and rice and keeping in mind the wgd pattern identified in the rice genome, a structural genome evolution model for barley was derived . it is based on  the above observation that major genome reorganizations took place before the divergence of the two species barley and rice and  the reduction of chromosome numbers from  <dig> in rice to  <dig> in barley occurred by combining  <dig> ancestral rice chromosomes into  <dig> barley chromosomes. the two barley chromosomes hv3h and hv6h corresponded to the ancestral chromosome type of rice chromosomes , subsequently described using the prefix 'a' . the structure of the remaining barley chromosomes could be explained by combining the ancestral type of two rice chromosomes, whereas the first appears to be nested within the second: hv1h = a <dig> → a <dig>  hv2h = a <dig> → a <dig>  hv4h = a <dig> → a <dig>  hv5h = a <dig> → a <dig>  and hv7h = a <dig> → a <dig> . after species divergence, barley along with other members of the triticeae, underwent a lineage specific translocation of the distal part of the short arm of hv4h to the long arm of hv5h  <cit>  .

while long-range conservation of synteny among barley and rice was found to be well conserved, small inversions in one of the two species disturbed colinearity at mb-scale. these included, for instance, the orthologous pairs hv2h_os04_ <dig>  hv4h_os03_ <dig>  and hv7h_os06_ <dig> and involved not more than  <dig> mb of the rice genome . ad_ <dig> allowed a deeper analysis of small chromosomal rearrangements due to its higher marker coverage and good genetic resolution in the two corresponding barley segments . here, perfect colinearity was observed for the duplicated segments on os <dig>  and os <dig>  . the order of corresponding barley-rice homologs, however, displayed a disruption of colinearity, which became visible after plotting the coordinates of homolog pairs against each other . a paracentric inversion could be observed for hv3h /os <dig>  and three paracentric inversions between hv1h and os <dig> . for both orthologous segments, the pattern of synteny could be partitioned into six regions using the coordinates of duplicated rice genes located most closely to the break points of colinearity. by following this indirect approach, inversions could be related to paralogous segments between barley and rice and among the paralogous barley segments themselves .

for rice genes located within duplicated genome segments, we observed a positive correlation of synteny to the barley genome and the retention of paralogous gene copies originating from wgd. conservation of orthologous relationships can be related to paralog retention of the corresponding genes in barley. this was assessed in greater detail for ad_ <dig>  ad_ <dig> and ad_ <dig>  which contained the highest numbers of barley-rice homologs . for instance, from the orthologous segment pairs on hv3h and os <dig> belonging to ad_ <dig>   <dig> rice genes shared synteny with barley. among these,  <dig> rice genes were duplicated on os <dig>  while the remaining  <dig> were not . from the remaining  <dig> rice genes embedded within this segment with no detectable synteny to barley,  <dig> were duplicated and  <dig> were not duplicated in rice  and thus the odds ratio was significantly higher than  <dig> .

discussion
a wgd event in a common ancestor shaped the genomes of cereal crop species such as rice and sorghum  <cit> . footprints of this event have been detected previously by analyzing the complete genome sequence of rice  <cit> . by using colinearity between the rice genome sequence and gene-based genetic maps or genome-wide physical maps, traces of this ancestral wgd could also be found in maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and barley  <cit> . in order to refine the picture of shared synteny between barley and rice, and relate this to the rice wgd footprint, we used an extensive gene-based genetic map of barley comprising ~ <dig> est sequences.

footprints of wgd in rice: common consensus, but differences in detail?
we analyzed release  <dig> of the rice japonica genome obtained from tigr and identified  <dig> distinct duplicated segments consisting of  <dig> duplicated genes covering  <dig> mb  of the rice genome. the  <dig> previously reported duplicated genes in ten duplicated blocks involving 45% of the rice genome  <cit>  were consistent with our results, but the detection of almost three times as many colinearily-ordered duplicated genes in the present study allowed us to discover additional duplicated segments, for instance among os03/os <dig> and os04/os <dig> . of the  <dig> duplicated segments identified by yu and co-workers  <cit> ,  <dig> corresponded to duplications identified in this study and explained 94% of the rice genome duplications that we observed. however, a direct comparison of the extent of duplicated segments would result in an underestimation of the true overlap mainly because of the different genome assemblies used in their study  that resulted in shifts of the coordinates of corresponding regions . compared to their study, we did not find evidence for the duplication between os <dig> and os <dig>  which appeared as the least supported duplication in terms of identified homologous pairs  and overlapped with larger  duplicated regions  <cit>  . in addition to these previous studies, we identified several smaller duplicated segments that were located either at the ends of rice chromosomes  or in close proximity to other duplicated regions suggesting pericentric inversions in one of the sister segments as an explanation for their location .

the ends of rice chromosomes os11/os <dig> differ from the other duplicated segments in the rice genome, both in terms of ks distribution of gene-duplicate pairs and gene retention rate. it was previously suggested that this segmental duplication originated less than 5– <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and emerged after the divergence of barley and rice. new findings suggested that both rice regions originated from the common cereal wgd, but were characterized by species-dependent concerted evolution acting independently in rice  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit> . thus, the high sequence similarity between paralogs in these regions may reflect the age of gene conversion, rather than the age of segmental duplication. there are contrasting views about the existence of the corresponding regions in wheat  <cit> . we found evidence for the existence of both duplicated segments on barley chromosomes hv4h and hv5h supported by  <dig> and  <dig> syntenic homologs, respectively. this was in agreement with findings of one of the studies in wheat  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that orthologous segments were located in the rarely recombining central parts of the barley chromosomes  and not at the chromosome ends as in rice and sorghum  <cit> .

local and background gene duplications are common in the rice genome  <cit> . their identification and filtering are crucial steps prior to screening for gene duplications that originated from wgd. we utilized the genomic location and gene pair density of rice genes and their homologs to distinguish wgd-related segmental duplications from local and background duplications. among the  <dig> annotated rice genes of rice assembly  <dig> provided by tigr, the rice genome annotation group identified  <dig> te-related genes . as non-directed gene duplication through transposon-like mechanisms could likely explain random background duplications identified by our approach, prior exclusion of identified te-related genes could potentially simplify downstream analysis. however, only 17%  of the genes involved in background duplications corresponded to te-related genes. therefore, pre-filtering of te-related genes would not significantly reduce background duplications. together with the observation that te-related genes were significantly underrepresented in both segmentally  and locally duplicated genes  , exclusion of rice te-related genes would further have negligible impact on the identification of wgd-derived segments in rice and hence was not our method of choice. previously described approaches to analyze the rice wgd included similar filtering steps, for instance using the location of duplicated genes in a visual approach using 2d scatter plots  <cit>  or by focusing on gene duplications originating from similar time intervals estimated by analysis of ks ratios  <cit> . hence, there is consensus that sequence conservation among genes alone is not a reliable feature to unravel duplicated segments originating from wgd in rice. moreover, this approach allowed us to identify  <dig> wgd-derived duplicated genes  that showed higher sequence similarity to more recent local duplications.

in a recent study by salse and co-workers  <cit> , rice genome duplications were analyzed using a previous rice annotation  and the program closeup  <cit> . genome duplications were detected for as many as  <dig> newly defined chromosome pairs. these did, however, neither correspond to  <dig> additional chromosome pairings in a synteny study with maize  <cit>  nor with previous literature  <cit> . similarly, they were not supported by our study. in comparison to our results, differences in both the location and extent of duplicated segments in the rice genome were apparent, and these could not be simply explained by scaling or shifting of bp-coordinates, as for the previously mentioned indica assembly  <cit>  . further, some regions involved in the wgd appeared less extensive , were not detected at all , or contradicted the wgd hypothesis because of overlaps between duplicated segments, e.g. for the long arm of rice chromosome os <dig>  or for two overlapping segments on os <dig> duplicated on two distinct regions of rice os <dig>  finally, we could not detect footprints of wgd in segments that contained the centromere. neither did previous studies in rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> .

arabidopsis underwent three successive rounds of wgd, which according to their time of origin and subsequent diploidization, represent different portions of the arabidopsis transcriptome   <cit> . ks analysis of the corresponding gene pairs supported this hypothesis  <cit> . in rice, contrasting views about the extent of genome duplications and their mode of origin have been discussed in the literature . one study  <cit>  used a computational approach assuming a conserved order of paralogs to identify segmental duplications in the rice genome. they found a non-uniform distribution of segmental duplications across rice chromosomes involving not more than 20% of the genome. by additionally looking at ks distribution of all duplicated genes  <cit> , it was concluded that rice evolved from an ancient aneuploid rather than an ancient polyploid. other studies  <cit>  accumulated sufficient evidence for a wgd event explaining most of the genome duplications they observed in rice. in this study, we determined that more than 70% of the rice genome consisted of distinct duplicated segments characterized by colinearily-ordered duplicated gene pairs with a similar gene loss pattern and identical segment-wise ks distributions. we therefore support the hypothesis of a single  ancient wgd, with rice  evolving from a tetraploid grass progenitor, which then diploidized by genome rearrangement and gene loss. we did not find evidence for colinear arrangement of higher-order homologs and thus did not find support for more than one ancient genome duplications in rice . this result concurs with previous findings that failed to provide indications of multilevel duplication  <cit> .

in contrast, salse and co-workers  <cit>  identified  <dig> duplicated regions superimposed upon duplicated regions involved in the wgd. superimposition was prominent since 43%, 9% and 3% of the rice genome consisted of  <dig> times,  <dig> times and  <dig> times superimposed duplicated regions, respectively . although those findings were evaluated as statistically significant by the closeup program  <cit> , it remains debatable whether they reflect the true evolutionary history of the rice genome. the non-nested arrangement inside wgd-derived duplicated segments is incompatible with the hypothesis that the superimposed segments were remnants of more ancient segmental duplications as was suggested for arabidopsis, where the β and γ segments were found to be nested inside the α segments  <cit> . if, however, such segments were of more recent origin, the number of duplicated genes located within them would be considerably higher. also, it was reported that closeup assigned high statistical significance to cluster pairs that were probably spurious in a maize dataset and that the detection of homologous regions could have been obscured by random background matches  <cit> . probably, very stringent sequence conservation parameters  <cit>  alone were not sufficient to eliminate the influence of local and background duplications in rice and penalized less conserved gene pairs, as only  <dig> loci  were found to be involved in segmental duplications, from which more than one third  contributed to gene pairs located on the first  <dig> mb of os11/os <dig> .

in summary, by analyzing the rice genome structure on an updated genome annotation, we found strong support for the commonly accepted single wgd hypothesis for the rice genome:  segmental duplications involved more than 70% of the rice genome as described previously.  no overlap among pairwise duplicated segments could be observed.  gene pairs located within corresponding sister segments were arranged in almost perfect colinear order.  the duplicated genes of nine out of the ten largest duplicated segments comprised equivalent ks distributions and gene retention rates suggesting a common origin.

shared patterns of wgd between barley and rice suggest a structural evolution model of the barley genome
the existence of shared patterns of a common wgd predating the divergence of barley and rice was supported by three observations in our data:  the pattern of macro-synteny between barley and rice was highly conserved. this implied that genome reorganization after wgd occurred in the common ancestor of both barley and rice before species divergence.  synteny between barley and rice involved the largest duplicated rice regions and for at least seven of these paralogous relationship in barley could be resolved to segments that were orthologous to duplicated regions in the ancestral grass genome progenitor.  smaller ks of barley-rice orthologs compared to paralogs located in wgd-derived segments in rice confirmed a wgd before species divergence.

the roughly  <dig> gene-based genetic map of barley provided sufficient coverage to explain genome wide shared synteny between barley and rice. the use of classical genetic maps in the presented study was however limited in the regions that correspond to central/centromeric parts of barley chromosomes. these regions are characterized by low recombination rates over large physical distances. resolution in these regions is poor and while the corresponding syntenic regions could be identified to the rice genome , inversions or even the orientation of whole syntenic rice chromosomes could not be fully resolved.

we found excellent correspondence to the grass genome colinearity model proposed by devos  <cit> . using colinearity to the rice genome, three recent studies suggested partly different grass genome evolution models for wheat  <cit> , which shares a close evolutionary relationship to barley. we found concordance with the first study  <cit>  except for the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  for which synteny was detected to os <dig> and not to os <dig> as in our study. differences to the second study  <cit>  regard chromosome  <dig> for which we detected synteny to os <dig>  in contrast to the third wheat study  <cit> , our data suggested correspondence of the triticeae specific translocated segment between barley hv4h and hv5h  <cit>  to the duplication between rice os <dig> and os <dig>  and not to the duplicated segments between os <dig> and os <dig> for which we identified synteny to central parts of barley hv4h and hv5h  at orthologous positions. further differences exist in the detection of duplications between barley hv6h and hv7h  that were not detected between the corresponding wheat chromosomes  <cit> .

the mosaic of syntenic segments between barley and rice in the present study resulted in a karyotype evolution model for the structurally similar triticeae genomes  in which five barley chromosomes represent combinations of two ancestral chromosomes. our data suggest a characteristic pattern of the respective 'fusion' chromosomes in which one ancestral chromosome was enclosed by a second ancestral chromosome evolving probably by similar mechanisms. similarly, reduction of chromosome numbers in sorghum  compared to rice  could be explained by combining os <dig> and os <dig> in sorghum chromosome sb and os <dig> and os <dig> in sc  <cit> . pericentric inversions and translocations between two ancestral chromosomes with terminal and pericentric breakpoints and subsequent loss of a minichromosome as one of the translocation products could most parsimoniously explain chromosome reduction in barley, similar as suggested for chromosome reduction within the brassicaceae family . together with inversions and the previously described translocation of the end of the short arm of hv4h to the long arm of hv5h within the triticeae  <cit> , the genome structure of barley could be explained by a collection of simple evolutionary mechanisms that retain a high degree of structural conservation with rice after the taxon divergence.

CONCLUSIONS
a barley genetic map consisting of approximately  <dig> non-redundant est sequences allowed us a detailed analysis of shared synteny with the rice genome. based on shared synteny between both species, the locations of at least seven corresponding duplicated segments were identified that originated from an ancestral wgd event. while small paracentric inversions and reduction of chromosome numbers were species specific, genome reorganization after wgd preceded taxon divergence as shared synteny extended the boundaries of rice duplicated genomic segments originating from wgd and only low levels of differential gene loss were found. our results indicate positions of wgd segments within the barley genome that are shared with rice and hence the potential location of putative barley paralogs. comparative analysis with the rice genome further showed that low-recombining central parts of barley chromosomes, although not represented by many genetic markers, can correspond to large physical regions of the rice genome consisting of many genes.
