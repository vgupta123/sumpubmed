BACKGROUND
human envenomation by snakes is a worldwide issue that claims more than  <dig>  lives per year and exacts untold costs in the form of pain, disfigurement, and loss of limbs or limb function  <cit> . despite the significance of snakebites, their treatments have remained largely unchanged for decades. the only treatments currently available are traditional antivenoms derived from antisera of animals, usually horses  <cit> , innoculated with whole venoms  <cit> ; such an approach is the only readily available option for largely uncharacterized, complex mixtures of proteins such as snake venoms. although often lifesaving and generally effective against systemic effects, these antivenoms have little or no effect on local hemorrhage or necrosis  <cit> , which are major aspects of the pathology of viperid bites and can result in lifelong disability  <cit> . these traditional treatments also sometimes lead to adverse reactions in patients  <cit> . advances in treatment approaches will depend on a complete knowledge of the nature of the offending toxins, but current estimates of the numbers of unique toxins present in snake venoms are in excess of  <dig>  <cit> , a number not approached in even the most extensive venom-characterization efforts to date  <cit> .

the significance of snake venoms extends well beyond the selective pressures they may directly impose upon human populations. snake venoms have evolutionary consequences for those species that snakes prey upon  <cit> , as well as species that prey upon the snakes  <cit> , and their study can therefore provide insights into predator-prey coevolution. snake venom components have been leveraged as drugs and drug leads  <cit>  and have been used directly as tools for studying physiological processes such as pain reception  <cit> . in addition to the significance of the toxins, the nature of the extreme specialization of snake venom glands for the rapid but temporary production and export of large quantities of protein could provide insights into basic mechanisms of proteostasis, the breakdown of which is thought to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinson’s and alzheimer’s  <cit> .

the eastern diamondback rattlesnake  is a pit viper native to the southeastern united states and is the largest member of the genus crotalus, reaching lengths of up to  <dig>  m  <cit> . the diet of c. adamanteus consists primarily of small mammals  and birds, particularly ground-nesting species such as quail  <cit> . because of its extreme size and consequent large venom yield, c. adamanteus is arguably the most dangerous snake species in the united states and is one of the major sources of snakebite mortality throughout its range  <cit> . crotalus adamanteus has recently become of interest from a conservation standpoint because of its declining range, which at one time included seven states along the southeastern coastal plain  <cit> . this species has now apparently been extirpated from louisiana and is listed as endangered in north carolina  <cit> . as a consequence of recent work by rokyta et al.  <cit>  based on  <dig> pyrosequencing, the venom of c. adamanteus is among the best-characterized snake venoms;  <dig> toxins have been identified.

transcriptomic characterizations of venom glands of snakes  <cit>  and other animals  <cit>  have relied almost exclusively on low-throughput sequencing approaches. sanger sequencing, with its relatively long, high-quality reads, has been the only method available until recently and has provided invaluable data on the identities of venom genes. because venomous species are primarily nonmodel organisms, high-throughput sequencing approaches have been slow to pervade the field of venomics , despite becoming commonplace in other transcriptomic-based fields. rokyta et al.  <cit>  recently used  <dig> pyrosequencing to characterize venom genes for c. adamanteus. more recently, durban et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> sequencing to study the venom-gland transcriptomes of a mix of rna from eight species of costa rican snakes. whittington et al.  <cit>  used a hybrid approach with both  <dig> and illumina sequencing to characterize the platypus venom-gland transcriptome, although they had a reference genome sequence, making de novo assembly unnecessary. pyrosequencing is expensive and low-throughput relative to illumina sequencing, and the high error rate, particularly for homopolymer errors  <cit> , significantly increases the difficulty of identifying coding sequences without reference sequences.

we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptome of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake with illumina technology using a paired-end approach coupled with short insert sizes effectively to produce longer, high-quality reads on the order of approximately  <dig> nt to facilitate de novo assembly . the difference in read length from that of  <dig> sequencing was compensated for by the increase of more than two orders of magnitude in the number of reads. we demonstrated de novo assembly and analysis of a venom-gland transcriptome using only illumina sequences and provided a comprehensive characterization of both the toxin and nontoxin genes expressed in an actively producing snake venom gland.

RESULTS
venom-gland transcriptome sequencing and assembly
we generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> pairs of reads that passed the illumina quality filter for >  <dig> gigabases  of sequence from a cdna library with an average insert size of ∼ <dig> nt. of these reads,  <dig> , <dig>  were merged  on the basis of their 3’ overlap , yielding composite reads of average length  <dig> nt with average phred qualities >  <dig> and a total length >  <dig> gb. this merging of reads reduced the effective size of the data set without loss of information and provided long reads to facilitate accurate assembly.

our first approach to transcriptome assembly was aimed at identifying toxin genes. we attempted to use as many of the data as possible to ensure the identification of even the lowest-abundance toxins. to this end, we conducted extensive searches of assembly parameter space for both abyss  <cit>   and velvet  <cit>  on the basis of the full set of both merged and unmerged reads. we used the assemblies with the best n <dig> values for further analysis. for velvet, the assembly using a k-mer size of  <dig> was best ; this assembly was subsequently analyzed with oases  <cit> . for abyss, the best k-mer value was also  <dig> , but because the performance in terms of full-length transcripts appeared to depend strongly on the coverage  and erode  parameters, we further analyzed the k =  <dig> assemblies with c =  <dig> and e =  <dig>  c =  <dig> and e =  <dig>  and c =  <dig> and e =  <dig>  we identified all full-length toxins by means of blastx searches on the results of all four assemblies.

as part of our first approach, we also performed four independent de novo transcriptome assemblies with ngen: three with  <dig> million merged reads each and one with the remaining  <dig> , <dig> merged reads . we identified all full-length toxins from all four assemblies. given that all three assembly methods tended to generate a large number of fragmented toxin sequences, apparently because of retained introns and possibly alternative splicing, we developed and implemented a simple hash-table approach to completing partial transcripts, which we will refer to as extender . we used extender on partial toxin sequences identified for two of the four ngen assemblies. we also annotated the most abundant full-length nontoxin transcripts for the three assemblies based on  <dig> million reads. after combining all of the annotated toxin and nontoxin sequences from the abyss, velvet, and ngen assemblies and eliminating duplicates, we had  <dig> unique toxin sequences and  <dig> unique nontoxin sequences. the paucity of full-length annotated nontoxins reflects our focus on toxin sequences rather than their absence in the assemblies.

our second approach to transcriptome assembly was designed to annotate as many full-length coding sequences  as possible and to build a reference database of sequences to facilitate the future analysis of other snake venom-gland transcriptomes. we found that ngen was much more successful at producing transcripts with full-length coding sequences but also that it was quite inefficient when the coverage distribution was extremely uneven . feldmeyer et al.  <cit>  also found ngen to have the best assembly performance with illumina data. we sought therefore first to eliminate the transcripts and corresponding reads for the extremely high-abundance sequences. to do so, we employed extender as a de novo assembler by starting from  <dig>  individual high-quality reads and attempting to complete their transcripts . from  <dig>  seeds, we identified  <dig> full-length coding sequences with  <dig> toxins and  <dig> nontoxins. after duplicates were eliminated, this procedure resulted in  <dig> unique toxin and  <dig> unique nontoxin full-length transcripts. these sequences were used to filter the corresponding reads from the full set of merged reads with ngen. we then performed a de novo transcriptome assembly on  <dig> million of the filtered reads with ngen, annotated full-length transcripts from contigs comprising ≥  <dig> reads with significant blastx hits, and used the resulting unique sequences as a new filter. this process of assembly, annotation, and filtering was iterated two more times. the end result was  <dig> unique toxin and  <dig>  unique nontoxin sequences.

the results from both assembly approaches were merged to yield the final data set. the first approach produced  <dig> unique toxin and  <dig> unique nontoxin sequences, and the second  <dig> toxin and  <dig>  nontoxin sequences. the merged data set consisted of  <dig> unique toxin sequences and  <dig>  nontoxins that together accounted for  <dig> % of the sequencing reads .

toxin transcripts
we identified  <dig> individual, unique toxin transcripts with full-length coding sequences. to estimate the abundances of these transcripts in the c. adamanteus venom-gland transcriptome, we clustered them into  <dig> groups with less than 1% nt divergence . clusters could include alleles, recent duplicates, or even sequencing errors, which are characteristic of high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . for longer genes, clusters might also include different combinations of variable sites that are widely separated in the sequence. we chose 1% as a practical, but arbitrary, cut-off for defining clusters. mapping reads back to more similar sequences to estimate abundances would be problematic because reads could not be uniquely assigned to a particular sequence. the true number of toxin genes for c. adamanteus probably lies somewhere between  <dig> and  <dig>  this range is at the lower end of the number of unique toxins typically identified for viperids by means of proteomic techniques  <cit> , which may indicate that the venom of c. adamanteus is less complex than that of other species. alternatively, posttranscriptional processes such as alternative splicing or posttranslational modifications could significantly increase the diversity of toxins present in the venom. our identified toxins accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads , and the vast majority of the extremely high-abundance transcripts were those encoding toxin proteins . we named toxins with a combination of a toxin-class abbreviation, a cluster number, and, if the cluster had more than a single member, a lower-case letter to indicate the member of the cluster .

we used the number or percentage of reads mapping to a particular transcript as a measure of its abundance. although average coverage might be a more appropriate proxy for the number of copies of a given transcript present, because it accounts for differences in transcript lengths, we prefer read counts as a measure of the expression expenditure on a given transcript because they better reflect the energetic cost associated with producing the encoded protein and are consistent with previous work using low-throughput sequencing . in addition, this measurement should more closely match proteomic-based measurements of the contents of venom components  which come in the form of the percentages of total peptide bonds in the sample.

snake venom metalloproteinases
we identified  <dig> unique sequences and  <dig> clusters of snake-venom metalloproteinases  that accounted for  <dig> % of the reads mapping to toxin sequences and  <dig> % of the total reads . in terms of total reads, the svmps were the most abundant class of toxins in the c. adamanteus venom-gland transcriptome. svmps are the primary sources of the local and systemic hemorrhage associated with envenomation by viperids and are divided into a number of subclasses based on their domain structure  <cit> . all svmps have a metalloproteinase domain characterized by a zinc-binding motif. all of the svmps identified for c. adamanteus belong to either the type ii or the type iii subclass. type ii svmps  have a disintegrin domain in addition to the metalloproteinase domain, which may be proteolytically cleaved posttranslationally to produce a free disintegrin. type iii svmps  have a disintegrin-like and a cysteine-rich domain in addition to the metalloproteinase domain. we found  <dig> clusters of each of these two subclasses with  <dig> unique svmpii sequences and  <dig> unique svmpiii sequences. svmpii and svmpiii clusters comprise  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads mapping to toxins respectively . the sequences in both subclasses are diverse. the maximum pairwise nt divergence for the svmpiis was  <dig> %, corresponding to a maximum amino-acid divergence of  <dig> %. for the svmpiiis, the maximum pairwise nt divergence was  <dig> % with a maximum amino-acid divergence of  <dig> %. although svmps were the dominant toxins as a class, the individual svmp cluster with the highest abundance was svmpii- <dig>  which was only the eighth most abundant toxin cluster .

mackessy  <cit>  categorized rattlesnake venoms as type i or type ii on the basis of their toxicities and metalloproteinase activities. these two measurements tend to be inversely related in rattlesnakes: species  with low ld <dig> values tend also to have low or undetectable hemorrhagic activities. svmps are the major hemorrhagic components of snake venoms, and high toxicity appears to be caused mostly by neurotoxic venom components. low-toxicity venoms with high metalloproteinase activity are classified as type i, and high-toxicity venoms with low metalloproteinase activity are classified as type ii. on the basis of the abundance of svmps in the venom-gland transcriptome, c. adamanteus clearly has type i venom, although the relatively low toxicity of its venom  <cit>  is at least partially compensated for by its large size and venom yield.

c-type lectins
the most diverse and the second most abundant toxin class in the c. adamanteus venom-gland transcriptome was the c-type lectin  class. we identified  <dig> unique sequences and  <dig> clusters of ctls that accounted for  <dig> % of the reads mapping to toxins and  <dig> % of the total reads . ctls generally either inhibit or activate components of plasma or blood-cell types, thereby interfering with hemostasis  <cit> . most known snake-venom ctls function as heterodimers or even more complex arrangements  <cit> , probably accounting in part for their diversity. the divergence among members of this class within the c. adamanteus genome was extreme, although all members preserved a ctl-like domain. some pairs shared virtually no conserved amino-acid positions. three of the ctl clusters provide evidence for the relevance of alternative splicing in the generation of toxin proteins. ctl-3f, ctl-4e, and ctl9b all have 48-nt insertions in the same region but are otherwise similar or identical to other members of their clusters.

snake venom serine proteinases
the third most abundant toxin class for c. adamanteus was the snake-venom serine proteinases . we identified  <dig> unique sequences and  <dig> clusters in this toxin class, accounting for  <dig> % of the toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads . three of the  <dig> most highly expressed individual toxins were svsps . svsps interfere with a wide array of reactions involving blood coagulation and hemostasis and belong to the trypsin family of serine proteases  <cit> . mackessy  <cit>  detected significant thrombin-like and kallikrein-like activity in the venom of c. adamanteus, which are attributable to the action of svsps. the diversity of svsps within the c. adamanteus genome is high; maximum pairwise nt divergence is  <dig> % and amino-acid divergence is  <dig> %.

the members of two svsp clusters differ in a way that should be noted. the lengths of svsps are generally well conserved throughout the class. svsp-7a has a 27-nt insertion relative to the two other members of its cluster but is otherwise identical to svsp-7b. this difference could reflect the presence of alternative splicing for this gene. svsp-3a is unique among the c. adamanteus svsps or those known from other snake species in apparently having a 65-amino-acid extension of its c-terminal region. the other member of its cluster, svsp-3b, has a single deletion of a c nt in a poly-c tract that terminates its coding sequence consistently with other known svsps. the reads generating the svsp-3a form vastly outnumber those for the svsp-3b form; more than 95% of the reads support the extended version of the protein. the effect, if any, of this c-terminal extension remains to be determined.

phospholipase a2’s
previous work with c. adamanteus identified only a single phospholipase a <dig>  sequence  <cit> , but we identifed seven unique sequences in six clusters , accounting for  <dig> % of the toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads . pla2s are among the most functionally diverse classes of snake-venom toxins and have pharmocological effects ranging from neurotoxicity  to myotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. anticoagulant and hemolytic effects due to pla2s are also known  <cit> . compared to other toxin classes of c. adamanteus, the diversity of pla2s is low. five of the six clusters are all within 5% nt divergence of one another. pla2- <dig> is the lone, high-divergence outlier, differing by more than 31% at the nt level from the other clusters. pla2- <dig> is also expressed at the lowest level of any of the pla2s .

other high-abundance toxins
the svmps, ctls, svsps, and pla2s account for 74% of the reads mapping to toxin sequences , 73% of the toxin clusters, and 82% of the unique toxin sequences. the remaining toxins belong to  <dig> different classes. many of these are low-abundance transcripts  and may not actually function as significant toxins, whereas several others have high to moderate abundances and represent significant components of the venom.

the most abundant toxin transcript and the most abundant transcript overall  was a small basic myotoxin related to crotamine  <cit> . the precursor protein is just  <dig> amino acids in length with a predicted 22-amino-acid signal peptide. this transcript was detected by rokyta et al.  <cit> , but the coding sequence was prematurely truncated in their sequence because of a single nt deletion. this toxin accounts for  <dig> % of the toxin reads  and  <dig> % of the total reads. crotamine, originally isolated from the venom of c. durissus, causes spastic paralysis in mice and is found in the venoms of many species of crotalus <cit> . muscle spasms, twitching, and paralysis of the legs have been reported for human envenomations by c. adamanteus <cit> . interestingly, straight et al.  <cit>  noted that individuals of c. adamanteus from populations in southern and central florida lack this toxin in their venoms. given that this myotoxin is the most abundant transcript in the venom of our specimen, its absence in southern populations points to a dramatic difference in venoms within this species and the potential for significantly different pathological effects associated with bites from different c. adamanteus populations.

a single l-amino-acid oxidase  transcript was the second most abundant toxin transcript , consistent with the previously detected laao activity in the c. adamanteus venom  <cit> . this single transcript accounted for  <dig> % of the reads mapping to toxins and  <dig> % of the total reads. laaos are flavoproteins, giving the venom its yellow color; can be edema- or apoptosis-inducing; and can induce or inhibit platelet aggregation  <cit> . these effects are probably mediated by h2o2released during the oxidation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. the 29th most abundant toxin transcript was a cysteine-rich secretory protein  , accounting for  <dig> % of the toxin reads . although crisps are widely found in snake venoms, their precise effects are not well established  <cit> , but they appear to interfere with smooth-muscle contraction  <cit> . a single transcript for a bradykinin-potentiating and c-type natriuretic peptide transcript  was found to account for  <dig> % of the toxin reads . the encoded protein is similar to a protein identified in sistrurus catenatus  that was hypothesized to reduce blood pressure in envenomated prey  <cit> . a loss of blood pressure has been reported in human envenomations by c. adamanteus <cit> .

other low-abundance toxins
the remaining  <dig> clusters are classified as “others” in figure 3a. because each has a relatively low expression level , many of these should be considered putative toxins until their presence in the c. adamanteus venom is confirmed proteomically and pharmacological effects are associated with them.

rokyta et al.  <cit>  detected the presence of a transcript encoding a protein homologous to ohanin from ophiophagus hannah <cit>  and to a homologous protein from lachesis muta <cit> ; we found a transcript identical to that of rokyta et al.  <cit> . pung et al.  <cit>  found the o. hannah version of this protein to increase pain sensitivity  and to induce temporary hypolocomotion in mice and proposed naming the class vespryns . exceptionally intense pain has been reported after envenomation of humans by c. adamanteus <cit> , although whether such pain is due to a specific toxin is not clear.

we detected three different nucleotidases  and five different phosphodiesterases  in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus. only one of the nucs and three of the pdes had signal peptides, and we therefore only considered these as potential toxins: nuc, pde, pde- <dig>  and pde- <dig> . the roles of these enzymes in venoms are uncertain, but their primary function may be to liberate toxic nucleosides  <cit> . significant pde activity has been detected previously in the venom of c. adamanteus <cit> .

the c. adamanteus venom-gland transcriptome contained three kunitz-type protease inhibitors . two of these shared more than 75% animo-acid identity with a kun from austrelaps labialis , an australian elapid. all three kuns have domains that place them in the superfamily of bovine pancreatic trypsin-like inhibitors, and snake toxins from this family are known to inhibit plasma serine proteinases. although kuns are commonly observed in snake venoms, their role in envenomation  is not well defined  <cit> . the three kuns detected for c. adamanteus are all at relatively low abundances, suggesting that they are not major components of the venom.

we identified two transcripts, hyal- <dig> and hyal- <dig>  encoding hyaluronidase-like proteins. hyaluronidases are generally regarded as venom components that promote the dissemination of other venom components by degrading the extracellular matrix at the site of injection  <cit> , although they may have more direct toxic effects  <cit> . the coding sequences of our two transcripts differ only in the presence of a 765-nt deletion in hyal- <dig> relative to hyal- <dig>  truncated hyaluronidases such as hyal- <dig> have been detected in the venoms of other viperid species  <cit>  and may represent an example of alternative splicing. we also identified a transcript encoding a glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase . many snake venom components have n termini blocked by pyroglutamate, and gcs catalyze the formation of this block. this component is related more to maturation and protection of other toxins and probably contributes only indirectly to toxicity  <cit> .

we identified six growth-factor-related sequences in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus: a nerve growth factor , a neurotrophic factor , two vascular endothelial growth factors  in a single cluster, and a cysteine-rich with egf-like domain protein . the ngf transcript encodes a  <dig> amino-acid precursor protein and shares 99% amino-acid identity with a ngf from c. durissus . the nf transcript encodes a 180-amino-acid precursor that shares homology with mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factors. we found no close venom-related sequences for this nf in the available databases. the vegf sequences appear to be alternatively spliced versions of one another. vegf-1a encodes a 192-amino-acid precursor, and vegf-1b encodes a 148-amino-acid precursor. aside from the 132-nt deletion in vegf-1b relative to vegf-1a, their coding sequences are identical. both forms have database matches of the same length with 99% amino-acid identity from trimeresurus flavoviridis . finally, we detected the same cysteine-rich with egf-like domain protein as described by rokyta et al.  <cit> .

the final two putative toxin transcripts are of questionable significance because of their low expression levels. a single sequence with 77% amino-acid identity to a waprin  sequence from philodryas olfersii , a rear-fanged colubrid, was detected. related sequences have been detected in a variety of other rear-fanged snake species, but such proteins are only known to exhibit antimicrobial activity  <cit> . we detected a venom factor  transcript that shares 87% animo-acid identity with a vf from austrelaps superbus   <cit> . the c. adamanteus vf transcript encodes a  <dig> -amino-acid precursor with a 22-amino-acid signal peptide. the best-studied member of this toxin family is cobra venom factor, which is known to activate the complement system  <cit> . the extremely low expression levels of these transcripts may indicate that they represent the orthologous genes to the ancestors of the known toxic forms and may therefore have no toxic functions.

comparison to previous work
rokyta et al.  <cit>  previously described toxin transcripts in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus on the basis of  <dig> pyrosequencing. their work used rna from the venom gland of the same individual used in the present work. they found  <dig> unique toxin transcripts,  <dig> of which contained only partial coding sequences. table  <dig> lists the closest matches from our current sequences to those of rokyta et al.  <cit> . the vast majority of the 454-based sequences had either identical matches in our current set of toxins or matches with less than 1% nt divergence . only a single  <dig> toxin, svsp- <dig>  did not have a close match. this sequence contains only a partial coding sequence and therefore may not represent a true, functional toxin.

nontoxin transcripts
we characterized the nontoxin genes expressed in the c. adamanteus venom gland by two means. first, we took all of the contigs from one of our four de novo ngen assemblies based on  <dig> million merged reads and conducted a full blast2go  <cit>  analysis on the contigs comprising ≥  <dig> reads. of the  <dig>  contigs , we were able to provide gene ontology  annotations for  <dig>  of them . the major functional classes  represented in these results were binding and catalysis, followed by transcription regulation . the major biological process go terms  were cellular processes and metabolic processes . interestingly, viral reproductive function was detected and probably represents the activity of transposable elements or retroviruses like those previously noted in snake venom-gland transcriptomes  <cit> . the major cellular component go terms  were cell and organelle . for these results, we made no attempt to exclude toxin sequences, because they are necessarily a small minority of the total sequences, and did not require that contigs contain full-length coding sequences.

for our second approach, we used only the  <dig>  transcripts with full-length coding sequences for nontoxin proteins. we analyzed these sequences with blast2go. the distributions of level  <dig> go terms for these data were almost identical to those of the full ngen assembly described above , suggesting that our  <dig>  annotated nontoxin sequences provide a representative sample of the full venom-gland transcriptome. the full distributions of go terms for these sequences across all levels are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  as expected for a secretory tissue, processes related to protein production and secretion were well represented , as were protein-binding functions  and proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum  and the golgi apparatus .

four of the top  <dig> most highly expressed nontoxin genes , including the most highly expressed, were protein disulfide isomerases . in particular, they were members of the pdi family that is retained in the er and are characterized by having two or more pdi domains, which are similar to thioredoxin. pdis catalyze the formation or breaking of disulfide bonds and are therefore involved in protein folding. molecular chaperones were well represented in the top  <dig> nontoxins by four genes: endoplasmin , calreticulin, 78-kda glucose-regulated protein , and heat shock protein  <dig>  the latter gene appears to be a splice variant of grp <dig>  differing within the coding region by two point mutations and two short deletions. all of these chaperones are er specific. six of the top  <dig> nontoxins were mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative cellular respiration, consistent with the high energetic demands of venom production  <cit> : cytochrome c oxidase subunits i and iii, cytochrome b, and nadh dehydrogenase subunits  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the cells of venom glands are particularly rich in mitochondria  <cit> . four genes were involved in various aspects of translation: two translation elongation factors, 18s rrna, and vigilin. vigilins are hypothesized to be involved in regulating mrna stability and translation and might be involved in rna-mediated gene silencing  <cit> . the final top  <dig> nontoxin gene was actin, a component of the cytoskeleton.

the abundances of several major classes of nontoxins are provided in figure 3b. we identified  <dig> sequences with functions related to protein folding  <cit> , including various classes of heat-shock proteins, protein-disulfide isomerases, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, dnaj-complex components, and t-complex components. these sequences together accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads mapping to nontoxins. ribosomal-protein transcripts  accounted for  <dig> % of the nontoxin reads, and mitochondrial genes accounted for another  <dig> %. finally, we identified  <dig> sequences transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein degradation  <cit> , including proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the er-associated protein-degradation system  <cit> , which accounted for  <dig> % of the nontoxin reads. protein-quality control should be essential in a high-throughput protein-producing tissue such as a snake venom gland.

our collection of nontoxins included several notable potential inhibitors of the toxins or other proteases . such inhibitors may play a role in preventing autolysis  <cit>  or may serve to protect venom components once inside a victim  <cit> . we detected three cystatin-like transcripts in the venom gland. cystatins are cysteine-protease inhibitors and have been detected in numerous elapid venom glands and venoms  <cit> . we detected three unique metalloproteinase inhibitors and two serine proteinase inhibitors . finally, we found four unique pla <dig> inhibitors.

sequence accession numbers
the original, unmerged sequencing reads were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information  sequence read archive under accession number sra <dig>  the annotated toxin and nontoxin sequences were submitted to the genbank transcriptome shotgun assembly  database under accession numbers ju173621–ju <dig>  and ju173744–ju <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the most comprehensive venom-gland transcriptomic characterization of a snake species to date and provided full-length coding sequences for  <dig> unique toxin proteins and  <dig>  unique nontoxin proteins. we have demonstrated the use of illumina sequencing technology for the sequencing and de novo assembly of a tissue-specific transcriptome for a nonmodel species, c. adamanteus, for which genome-scale resources were previously unavailable. because the nontoxin sequences in particular should be conserved across snake species, our results should greatly facilitate similar work with other venomous species, serving as an assembly template and reducing the number of reads for which de novo assembly will be necessary.

the expressed toxin genes in the venom gland of c. adamanteus provide a detailed portrait of a type i rattlesnake venom  <cit> . the most abundant transcript expressed in the c. adamanteus venom gland encoded a myotoxin homologous to crotamine. crotamine is known to induce spastic paralysis  <cit> , a symptom that has been observed in human envenomations by c. adamanteus <cit> . like those of most viperids, the bites of c. adamanteus result in significant tissue damage and necrosis, and we found that svmps, the major class of hemorrhagic toxins, dominated venom-gland gene expression. the second most abundant toxin transcript overall was an laao, which are also noted for causing local tissue damage  <cit> . coagulopathy is a common occurrence with pit-viper bites  <cit> . the ctls and svsps were also both diverse and abundant in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus, and both classes primarily attack the hemostatic system. in terms of gene sequences of venom components, the venom of c. adamanteus is now the best-characterized snake venom, although a thorough proteomic analysis of the venom is still needed. the sequences we have generated will greatly facilitate such a proteomic characterization by serving as a database against which to query mass-spectrum results.

the expression patterns of the nontoxin genes in the venom gland of c. adamanteus reflect the protein-secretory function of the tissue and the high energetic demands of rapid venom production  <cit> . the most highly expressed nontoxin genes were those involved in the production and processing of proteins and energy production to support these activities. molecular chaperones and pdis were particularly abundant. though the expression patterns for nontoxins were not surprising, future comparisons with other snake species, especially those from other snake families, may be able to elucidate the origin and early stages of the evolution of the venom gland.
