BACKGROUND
strains of enteropathogenic e. coli  are a well-recognised cause of diarrhoea, particularly in children in less developed countries  <cit> . epec are characterised in part by their ability to induce attaching-effacing  lesions in the intestine  <cit> . these lesions are comprised of bacteria intimately attached to the intestinal mucosa at sites of cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to characteristic morphological changes, known as cupping and pedestal formation, accompanied by the absence of microvilli. the genes required for the production of these lesions are located on a pathogenicity island known as the locus for enterocyte effacement , which encodes  intimin, an outer membrane protein product of the eae gene that acts as an adhesin,  a type iii protein secretory system, and  several effector proteins secreted by the type iii system, including a translocated intimin receptor, tir, which, once bound to intimin, serves as an anchor for host cytoskeletal proteins  <cit> . epec is divided into two subtypes: typical and atypical. typical epec  strains carry a ca. 90-kb epec adherence factor plasmid  that encodes type iv-like bundle-forming pili   <cit> . the latter facilitate the adherence of bacteria to the intestinal mucosa and to each other, allowing them to form micro-colonies on epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . studies with adult volunteers have demonstrated that intimin, peaf and bfp are essential virulence determinants of epec  <cit> . interestingly, there is evidence that a subset of epec strains, known as atypical epec , which lack peaf and bfp, are also pathogenic  <cit> .

aepec is defined as e. coli which possess lee, but lack peaf/bfp and do not produce shiga toxins  <cit> . evidence of the pathogenicity of aepec comes from case control studies of paediatric diarrhoea in several countries throughout the world, including australia, iran, norway, peru, poland, south africa, the united kingdom and the usa . in addition, at least three separate studies have shown an association between infection with aepec and persistent diarrhoea in children  <cit> . notwithstanding these reports, the pathogenicity of aepec remains controversial, chiefly because several studies have found aepec in patients with diarrhoea and control subjects at similar frequencies. these conflicting observations prompt the question of whether aepec comprise a homogeneous group of pathogens with shared virulence determinants, such as adhesins analogous to bfp, or whether they are heterogeneous, with one or more subsets being more virulent than others. although some clinical isolates of a/e strains of e. coli which meet the definition of aepec, appear to be shiga-toxin producing strains of e. coli  that have lost the shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophage during passage through the intestine  <cit> , others may be tepec strains that have lost peaf  <cit> . alternatively, aepec may represent a distinct subset of human-specific strains of a/e e. coli or be acquired from domestic animals, such as calves and rabbits, that are commonly infected with epec strains, which lack peaf  <cit> . in this study we characterised a large number of clinical isolates of aepec from humans by multi-locus sequence typing , pcr and/or dna hybridisation for e. coli virulence-associated determinants, intimin type, hep- <dig> adherence pattern and type  <dig> pilus production as a way of addressing these questions.

RESULTS
mlst analysis
we have previously reported that aepec isolates obtained during a water quality study were heterogeneous in terms of serotype, intimin type and patterns of adherence to hep- <dig> cells  <cit> . this overall heterogeneity was confirmed by mlst analysis, which showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> aepec strains of human origin investigated in the study belonged to one of  <dig> different clades and that  <dig> strains could not allocated to a clade . as observed with phylogenetic analyses of a/e strains of e. coli in general, there was a tendency for each clade to contain strains with the same intimin and flagellar type. five of  <dig> clades which contained aepec strains in this study were clades that include either tepec or stec strains, whereas six clades were apparently distinct for aepec. these six clades comprised one which contained three strains with intimin-β and h <dig> ; one clade with seven strains with intimin-ν and h <dig> ; one clade with six strains with intimin-θ and h <dig> ; a clade with five strains with intimin-ι and h <dig> or h- ; one with four strains with intimin-κ and h <dig> or h- , and one with  <dig> strains with intimin-α and h <dig> or h <dig> . the last-mentioned clade was closely related to a tepec clade , which also comprises strains with intimin-α and flagellar antigen, h <dig> 

of the strains that clustered with known clades of tepec or ehec, three  belonged to the ehec- <dig> clade, which also includes the pandemic, prototypical o157:h <dig> ehec clone. five aepec isolates grouped within the epec- <dig> clade which includes peaf/bfp-positive strains with intimin-β and h <dig>  the aepec serotypes in this clade included o15:hnt, o114:h <dig>  o117:h <dig>  o128:h <dig>  and ont:h <dig>  this clade also contained the prototypical aepec strain, e <dig>  <cit> , two rabbit-specific epec  strains, 84/110/ <dig> and e <dig> , and a calf isolate, also o103:h <dig>  but with intimin-ε. four aepec strains were assigned to the epec- <dig> clade . all of these strains were intimin-β; two were o33:h <dig>  and the others were o139:h <dig> and ont:h <dig>  two aepec strains, both o2:h <dig>  intimin-κ, belonged to the epec- <dig> clade, which also included tepec strain o86:h <dig>  intimin-κ. overall, three of  <dig> australian and new zealand isolates from humans reported here belonged to ehec clades,  <dig> fell within epec clades,  <dig> belonged to clades distinct for aepec, and  <dig> could not be classified.

of the eight australian calf isolates examined, three were not assigned to a particular clade, and four belonged to the ehec- <dig> clade , but were of different serotypes from each other . this clade also included archetypal aepec strains e65/ <dig>  and f <dig> , which were isolated in europe more than  <dig> years ago, and a well-studied, repec strain, 83/ <dig> , in which ral, a k88-like adhesin, was first identified  <cit> . none of the australian or new zealand strains of human origin investigated in this study belonged to this clade, suggesting that there was no major exchange of aepec strains between the cattle and humans from whom these bacteria were obtained. one calf isolate  was assigned to the epec- <dig> clade, which also contained repec strains e <dig> and 84/110- <dig> , tepec strain, stoke w , and the prototypical aepec strain, e <dig> . no aepec strains carrying intimin-β <dig>  -ξ, -o, -ρ or -σ were identified in the entire collection of  <dig> test and  <dig> reference strains reported here.

frequency of adhesins and other virulence determinants of pathogenic e. coli in aepec strains
none of the  <dig> australian aepec strains of human origin investigated in this study was positive in the pcr for genes encoding the following adhesins of pathogenic e. coli: bfp, lda, pap, saa, afa, sfa/foc, k <dig>  k <dig>  af/r <dig> or ralg . on the other hand, all strains were positive in the pcr for fimh of type  <dig> pili. moreover, all isolates exhibited mannose-sensitive haemagglutination, indicating that they produced functional type  <dig> pili.

a no strain was positive in the pcr for bfp, lda, pap, saa, afa, sfa/foc, k <dig>  k <dig>  af/r <dig> or ralg, and no strain hybridised with a probe for k <dig>  all strains were positive in the pcr for fimh. b adherence pattern after  <dig> hours' incubation with hep- <dig> cells: aa, aggregative adherence; ia, indeterminate pattern; la-l, localised-like adherence; na, non-adherent.

one strain, nt <dig>  was the only one of the  <dig> aepec isolates investigated that was positive in the pcr for afa, a virulence determinant of uropathogenic e. coli that also serves as an adhesin in some epec strains  <cit> .

two strains, r <dig> and r <dig>  which belonged to a distinct aepec clade, characterised by intimin-β and h <dig> flagella, were positive in the pcr for af/r <dig>  a fimbrial adhesin and essential virulence determinant of the prototypical repec strain, rdec- <dig>  <cit> . one strain, r <dig> , was the only one that tested positive for agga, the pilin subunit of enteroaggregative e. coli  <cit> . three strains, nt <dig>  nt <dig>  and nt <dig>  were positive in the pcr for iha, an adherence-conferring protein that is highly prevalent in stec  <cit> . the iha-positive aepec strains identified here were unrelated to each other and to stec in terms of mlst type, intimin type and serotype .

the pcr for long polar fimbriae  was positive in  <dig>  of  <dig> strains, all of which were from patients with diarrhoea. lpf-positive strains occurred within the epec- <dig> clade , the aepec clade with intimin-ν and h <dig> , and the aepec clade with intimin-β and h <dig> . overall, seven of the lpf-positive isolates carried intimin-ν, and six had intimin-β.

we and others have previously reported that certain determinants of epec, which are not encoded by lee or the eaf plasmid, such as efa <dig>  nleb and the cytolethal distending toxin  are associated with virulence in attaching-effacing e. coli  <cit> . nleb was detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> strains tested, whereas efa <dig> was detected in  <dig> strains , all of which were also positive for nleb. nleb-positive strains were distributed amongst the following clades: ehec- <dig> , epec- <dig> , aepec- <dig> , aepec- <dig> . six nleb-positive isolates could not be assigned to a clade, although all carried intimin-θ . the efa1-positive strains occurred within the ehec- <dig> and epec- <dig> clades, as well as within the aepec- <dig> clade that was characterised by strains with intimin-β and h <dig>  seven  strains were positive in the pcr for cdt. three of these strains belonged to the aepec- <dig> clade , one belonged to epec- <dig> , and three were unassigned .

dna hybridization
to determine if aepec carry dna sequences related to those that code for the production of bfp, but were not amplified by the pcr for bfpa, we investigated the aepec strains by dna hybridisation using probes derived from the bfpa and bfpb genes of epec strain e2348/ <dig>  unexpectedly, six isolates  hybridised with the bfpa probe at high stringency. three of these strains belonged to the aepec clade with intimin-ι and h <dig>  but they belonged to different o-serogroups. the other three probe-positive strains also differed from each other. six strains hybridised with the bfpb probe. four of these were positive for intimin-α, three carried h <dig>  two carried h <dig>  but all were of different serotypes. no strain hybridised with both bfp probes.

some aepec strains from humans and animals express adhesins that are homologous to the k <dig> fimbriae of enterotoxigenic e. coli  <cit> . to determine if the aepec strains in our collection carried similar sequences, we probed these strains for the fae gene of k <dig>  but none of the aepec hybridised with this probe, even when tested at low stringency.

adherence to hep- <dig> cells
after incubation for three hours with hep- <dig> cells,  <dig>  of  <dig> aepec strains were adherent:  <dig> strains adhered in an aggregative pattern, and two in the pattern termed "localised-like adherence", because it resembles bfp-mediated localised adherence, but the bacteria are more loosely associated with each other than bfp-bearing strains. twenty-eight strains showed an indeterminate pattern of adherence described previously  <cit> , in which bacteria adhere in a mixed pattern of diffuse and localised-like adherence. thirteen strains did not adhere to hep- <dig> cells after  <dig> hours. extending the contact period of the bacteria with the hep- <dig> cells from  <dig> to  <dig> hours allowed some strains that had not adhered after  <dig> hours to adhere in an indeterminate pattern, but the pattern of strains that were adherent after  <dig> hours did not change.

five of the six strains that hybridised with the bfpa probe were non-adherent after three hours, whereas five of the six bfpb-positive strains showed aggregative adherence and one showed localised-like adherence. adherence to hep- <dig> cells was not associated with a positive pcr for either lpf or efa.

association of specific virulence determinants with clinical presentation
the  <dig> aepec strains we investigated by pcr, dna hybridisation and for adherence to hep- <dig> cells originated from individuals with different clinical presentations . fifty-seven isolates were obtained from patients with diarrhoea, and ten were from asymptomatic individuals. eleven isolates were from children with persistent diarrhoea , and  <dig> were from children with diarrhoea less than  <dig> days in duration. thirty-four strains were from patients in whom the duration of diarrhoea was not known. to determine if any of the putative accessory virulence determinants of aepec that were sought in this study were associated with a particular clinical presentation, we compared the frequency of these determinants in isolates from patients with and without diarrhoea, and those known to have acute or persistent diarrhoea. the results showed that the frequency of the factors investigated did not differ significantly between the groups under comparison .

a only determinants that were present in more than three isolates overall were included in this analysis.

discussion
the classification of diarrhoeagenic strains of e. coli into pathotypes has led to considerable improvement in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical presentation of infections with these bacteria, and has spawned novel strategies to diagnose and prevent these infections  <cit> . each pathotype of diarrhoeagenic e. coli carries a distinctive suite of virulence determinants, almost all of which show evidence of having been acquired on mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, transposons, bacteriophages and pathogenicity islands. interestingly, apart from their shared virulence determinants, strains of each pathotype often differ from each other in terms of serotype, biotype, phage type, and even with regard to the nature of the specific virulence determinants they carry, e.g., shiga toxin- <dig> or shiga toxin- <dig> in ehec, and heat-labile or heat-stable enterotoxin in enterotoxigenic e. coli  <cit> .

it was not surprising, therefore, that the clinical isolates of aepec we examined in this study were heterogeneous in every way we investigated them, including by using mlst to examine their phylogenetic relatedness. this analysis confirmed that some strains are closely related to tepec, while others are more like ehec  <cit> . indeed, one of the aims of this study was to determine if aepec obtained from patients with diarrhoea are derived from tepec that have lost peaf  <cit> , or lee-positive stec strains that have been cured of the stx-encoding bacteriophage  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that  <dig> aepec strains obtained from  <dig> humans in australia or new zealand belonged to ehec clades, and  <dig> belonged to clades that contain tepec. none of these  <dig> isolates belonged to serotypes of highly virulent or epidemic ehec or epec and none carried the gene for ehec-haemolysin  <cit> , suggesting that they did not recently arise from ehec strains. on the other hand, it was not surprising that three aepec strains, which were clustered together with ehec o157:h <dig>  were serotype o55:h <dig>  given the evidence that the latter appears to be the progenitor of ehec o157:h <dig>  <cit> .

most of the strains we investigated  either belonged to distinctive aepec clades or could not be classified, indicating further that they did not arise from ehec or tepec. even those strains which clustered with epec or ehec generally were of serotypes that are not common amongst tepec or stec strains that are associated with infection of humans. our finding that each bacterial isolate within each distinctive aepec clade generally carried the same intimin type mirrors observations made with tepec  <cit>  and provides further evidence that e. coli acquired the lee pathogenicity island on a number of separate occasions.

aepec in different clades did not differ from one another in terms of their association with acute or persistent diarrhoea. this conclusion is in keeping with our somewhat unexpected finding that repec strains e <dig> and 83/ <dig>  which carry closely related virulence determinants, and are proven pathogens of infant rabbits in which they cause a similar illness, clustered with epec and ehec, respectively.

our search for virulence determinants in clinical isolates of aepec revealed that a minority of strains carried homologues of dna sequences that encode known adhesins or other virulence-associated determinants of pathogenic e. coli. overall, six strains each hybridised with dna probes for bfpa and bfpb, respectively, and pcr analysis gave positive results for lpf , iha , af/r <dig> , afa , or agga . to our knowledge, this is the first time that af/r <dig> has been identified in any e. coli other than the prototypical repec strain, rdec- <dig>  <cit> , but we have not determined if this gene or any of the other putative virulence genes in the probe- or pcr-positive aepec strains we investigated is expressed by the strain that carries it. moreover, no strain was positive in the pcr for ldah, which is the only known specific adhesin of aepec identified so far  <cit> .

in this study we were unable to confirm previous reports that nleb or efa <dig>  which are key components of a genomic island of epec and virulent stec  <cit> , are markers of symptomatic infection with aepec  <cit> , largely because these determinants were present in so few strains . we also did not find any association between the presence of any genes for particular virulence determinants and the clinical presentation of patients in terms of the presence or duration of diarrhoea, but the small number of probe- or pcr-positive strains made the finding of statistically significant associations unlikely.

all of the aepec strains we investigated in this study expressed functional type i pili. although these pili are widespread amongst all varieties of e. coli, including non-pathogens, evidence is accumulating that these pili, which are well established virulence determinants of uropathogenic and systemically invasive e. coli  <cit> , may also contribute to the virulence of epec and enteroaggregative e. coli, particularly with respect to biofilm formation  <cit> . type i pili are also an essential virulence determinant of adherent-invasive e. coli  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of type i pili by a bfp-mutant of tepec was able to compensate for the absence of bfp and allowed bacteria to adhere to cultured epithelial cells in vitro  <cit> . whether type i pili contribute to the virulence of aepec, however, remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that aepec are highly heterogeneous in terms of serotype, intimin type, multilocus sequence type, pattern of adherence to hep- <dig> cells, and their carriage of known virulence genes . although we did not identify a common type of adhesive fimbria in aepec that is functionally equivalent to bfp, we cannot rule out that one exists. indeed, the fact that all tepec strains express bfp despite their phylogenetic heterogeneity supports the case for continued efforts to identify specific adhesins of aepec.
