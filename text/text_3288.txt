BACKGROUND
gastrointestinal nematodes are one of the most serious causes of disease in domestic ruminants worldwide  <cit> . production losses due to parasitism are two-fold; the direct cost of anthelmintic treatment and production losses due to ill-thrift and in extreme cases death  <cit> . in the face of the increasing incidence of anthelmintic resistance and the need to minimise drench residues in animal products, new strategies for control are required  <cit> .

breeding for host resistance has been shown to be a viable method of nematode control  <cit> . host resistance is heritable, with wide variability among individuals, and rapid genetic progress has been demonstrated in both research and commercial flocks  <cit> . moreover, computer simulation models have shown that selection for host resistance, using the phenotype low faecal worm egg count, should be stable over a short time frame such as 20 years  <cit> . this is supported by field data, where it was shown that when gastrointestinal nematodes were exposed to genetically resistant or susceptible sheep over a sustained period of time they showed no evidence of adaptation to their host  <cit> . these findings support the hypothesis that resistance is determined by many genes each with a relatively small effect  <cit>  and that selection for parasite resistance based on faecal egg count  is sustainable in the medium to long-term.

with sheep it is possible to manipulate breeding lines to produce strong phenotypic differences, in well-defined pedigrees, in a relatively short space of time. reduction of variation in genomic regions surrounding a beneficial mutation due to strong and recent selection is known as a “selective sweep”; identification of regions that have undergone selective sweeps can help to reveal genes underlying phenotypic differences. different statistics pick up different patterns of variation left by selection of a beneficial mutation. wright’s fixation index  is a single marker test that detects highly differentiated alleles, where positive selection in one area causes larger frequency differences between populations as compared to neutrally evolving alleles. peddrift  <cit>  is a program that also uses single markers to calculate exact probabilities of allele frequency differences, by using the recorded pedigree structure to take into account minor allele frequencies, genetic drift, founder and sampling effects. evidence of selection is shown by divergence from the expected distribution . unlike fst and peddrift, tests based on linkage disequilibrium, such as the extended haplotype homozygosity  statistic and its derivatives, are dependent on snp spacing and frequency, as they are multi-marker tests. the integrated haplotype score   <cit>  and cross population ehh   <cit>  tests are both based on extended haplotype. while ihs detect partial selective sweeps a moderate frequency , xp-ehh detects alleles that have risen to near fixation in one population , but remain polymorphic in the population as a whole. studies that search for signatures of selective sweeps tend to use multiple tests as they are largely complementary; ihs and xp-ehh have been used to search for recent positive selection in humans  <cit> , as well as other species such as cattle  <cit> .

recent advances in genomic technologies have provided new opportunities to detect regions in the sheep genome that have undergone selection. the advent of the snp <dig> beadchip provided  <dig>  evenly spaced single nucleotide polymorphisms  across the sheep genome for association analysis. the chip has already been utilised to map causal mutations for traits controlled by a single locus  and detect signatures of selection among sheep breeds  <cit> . the identification of genes or linked markers that have a significant association to parasite resistance could accelerate the genetic improvement of resistance to internal nematodes through marker-assisted selection  <cit> . additionally, identification of genes under selection in animals selected for resistance or susceptibility to gastrointestinal parasites will help in our understanding of the biological processes underlying this trait.

the snp <dig> beadchip provides a rapid way to detect regions under selection, which can be further fine-mapped using sequenom® or other technologies. to this end, lines of sheep that have been selected for resistance, resilience, or susceptibility coupled with high-density genetic maps are a key resource that would enable future marker assisted selection of animals without the need for parasite challenge. here we utilise data from romney and perendale parasite selection lines to conduct whole genomic screens for selection, in the hope of identifying loci, within and between the two breeds, that affect individual host resistance or susceptibility to nematode parasites.

RESULTS
quality control
after quality control  the final data set consisted of  <dig>  snp for the romney data set and  <dig>  snp for the perendale data set. in total  <dig> romney  and  <dig> perendale  animals passed the quality control. the average maf of the remaining snp over all samples was  <dig>   in the romney data set and  <dig>   in the perendale data set.

genome-wide analysis
two analytical methods, fst
 <cit>  and peddrift  <cit> , were used to detect differentiation between resistant and susceptible animals based on snp allele frequencies. while fst is a generic population differentiation statistic, peddrift is specific to this example in that it was designed to account for structure within the population surveyed.

as individual snp may not show a strong signal, a 5-snp moving average  was used to identify regions with strong signatures of selection over multiple snp, which also reduces noise  <cit> . the average win <dig> fst value in the romney selection lines  was  <dig>  , while differentiation was lower in the perendale selection lines  with an average win <dig> fst of  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> genomic regions contained the top  <dig> % of markers  ranked using win <dig> –log <dig> , with four regions containing genes that have previously been implicated or are candidates for resistance or susceptibility to gastrointestinal nematodes. the first region, on chromosome  <dig> , contains the leukocyte surface antigen cd <dig>  as well as dennd2d and three genes from the chitinase family, acidic mammalian chitinase , chitinase 3-like  <dig>  and oviduct-specific glycoprotein . selection was also observed on chromosome  <dig> , chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> , containing genes previously implicated in resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes.figure  <dig>

investigation of selection sweep on oar1
in total,  <dig> extra snps were genotyped in region 2; after quality control using the same criteria applied to the snp <dig> beadchip data,  <dig> of these snp were used for further analyses. as a consequence of genotyping extra snp, the peak fst value in the region increased slightly from  <dig>   to  <dig> .

the ld correlation coefficient r <dig> in region  <dig> was calculated for each of the selection lines separately . all four analyses showed a haplotype block between  <dig> snp  in region  <dig>  the romney selection lines showed high linkage disequilibrium  within the haplotype block, consistent with selection being imposed on the locus  <cit> .table  <dig>

haplotype frequency
haplotypes 1– <dig> were present in either the romney or perendale animals, or both. haplotype frequencies are given for each selection line.



analysis using sweep  showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> above snp created a haplotype block. in the romney lines two contrasting haplotypes were observed, denoted  <dig> and  <dig> . in the romney lines haplotype  <dig> was present in  <dig> % of the susceptible population, and  <dig> % of the resistant population. in the perendale animals the frequency of haplotype  <dig> was higher in the resistant animals  compared to the susceptible animals . there were six additional haplotypes observed in the perendale selection lines, although they were less frequent .

the integrated haplotype score   <cit>  and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity test   <cit>  are designed to uncover selected alleles with higher frequency than expected to their haplotype length. the most significant results were in the romney susceptible animals where ihs values approached significance .figure  <dig>

sequencing
after examination of the signals of selection in region  <dig> , the candidate gene chia  was chosen for exon sequencing. chia has previously been associated with the control of helminth infection  <cit> . other genes in the region include cd <dig>  chi3l <dig>  chia, and dennd2d. sequencing the chia exons of animals homozygous for both haplotypes showed the presence of several snp , however there were no snp that distinguished the animals of different haplotype or selection line. one snp at base  <dig> of the ovine chia mrna could potentially differentiate animals homozygous for haplotype  <dig> or  <dig>  this, however, would require genotyping in further animals to validate.

discussion
using single-marker tests for differentiation between selection lines, multiple areas were discovered where allele frequency differed between resistant and susceptible lines . this was expected, as variation in complex traits such as resistance to parasites are understood to be controlled by many polymorphisms, each of a small effect  <cit> . the classic model of a selective sweep involves a beneficial allele being rapidly driven to fixation . however, with complex traits selection may occur through polygenic adaptation, where adaptation occurs by simultaneous selection on variants at many loci. selection under a polygenic adaptation model would result in modest allele frequency changes across the genome, which may be undetectable using current methods for detecting selection  <cit> . despite this, the ‘hard sweep’ and polygenic models are not mutually exclusive, and the alleles with largest effect sizes may sweep to fixation  <cit> . polygenic traits will therefore show increased fst across the genomes, with alleles of a large effect showing increased fst in that particular region.

divergent lines of romney  <cit>  and perendale  <cit>  sheep were selectively bred for high and low fec by agresearch ltd from  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . one of the aims of this study was to discover if the romney and perendale selection lines have utilised the same genetic strategy in developing resistance or susceptibility to internal parasites. combined peddrift values were used to define the regions to examine for candidate genes as the test was designed to account for structure within each of the populations surveyed. while peaks were observed in both lines, these were better defined when smoothing, via a 5-snp window, was applied .table  <dig> 
summary data from romney and perendale selection lines
 <cit> 



it must be noted that the strongest signals of selection were observed in the romney selection lines, and the strength of the selection would have affected the combined data. as expected, the most extreme values for all statistics in the romney selection lines were larger than those observed in the perendale selection lines.

the perendale lines have not been selected for as long  and the genetic divergence in the selected trait is only half as large . the effective population size of the foundation animals is also likely to have had a strong bearing on the differences between the breeds, although this is difficult to determine due to the combination of two separate romney selection lines. the effective population size  for nz industry romneys  <dig> generations ago was estimated as  <dig> and for perendale  <dig>  derived from extensive analysis of more than  <dig>  new zealand animals genotyped with the snp <dig> beadchip  <cit> . as an interbreed of cheviot and romney  <cit>  the perendale animals are also likely to have a higher   <cit>  than a pure breed, which may contribute to the observed pattern in the data. however, since its establishment, the perendale breed has had a smaller population, which may contribute to low ld between closely spaced markers distances but greater ld between distant markers.

in the regions showing signatures of selection, candidate genes were defined as those with a previously reported role in immunity. we recognise that by examining in detail only those genes with obvious functional links to immunity we have eliminated some genes that could have novel and unexpected effects on the trait concerned, or may contain as yet unidentified features that have an effect separate from the gene itself. however, we believe our approach is a tractable solution, with the data and annotation currently available, and there will be potential to extend this analysis in the future. for example, several regions that appeared to be under selection from our analyses appear to contain no underlying genes . the current annotation of the sheep genome is not as comprehensive as that in humans or even cattle, and these areas cannot be completely dismissed as containing no genes or regulatory elements. this can only be improved following the recent annotation of version  <dig>  of the sheep genome by ensembl . it has also been observed that while some proposed candidates for selection have strong support in the form of a functional mutation with an identified phenotypic effect, often the functional target is unknown  <cit> .

the discovery that the same core haplotype  in region  <dig>  is observed in both susceptible romney and resistant perendale animals does not have an obvious explanation, but could be due to epistatic effects or a recent novel mutation. there was no correlation between haplotype and average estimated fec breeding value. following this, there are several possible reasons for the observed differences. it appears that selection in region  <dig> is primarily occurring in the romney susceptible line. this is supported by the greater number of haplotypes that were observed in the perendale selection lines in the sweep  analysis. sequencing the chia exons of animals homozygous for both haplotypes showed the presence of several snp; however none were responsible for the observed haplotype. the observed effect could also be driven by a regulatory element, such as a transcription factor, that could be interacting with a locus or loci in other parts of the genome  <cit> . in addition, while perhaps not the most likely scenario, a causal mutation in the region could have occurred separately in perendale and romneys, on the opposite haplotype block, which would explain the differences observed. unravelling this, however, is complicated by the fact that the perendale breed was formed in  <dig> by crossing a cheviot over a romney, thus half of the perendale genome is in effect of romney origin.

comparison with other studies showed that only two of the regions identified using peddrift values  were contained within a previously identified qtl . region  <dig> overlaps a qtl located on chromosome  <dig>  for resistance to haemonchus contortus infestation in merino sheep  <cit> . the qtl was not considered by the authors a good candidate for fine-mapping because evidence for the qtl decreased with confirmatory mapping. region  <dig> is contained within two suggestive qtl detected on chromosome  <dig> in a genome scan for for resistance to haemonchus contortus resistance in romane x martinik black belly backcross lambs  <cit> . the suggestive qtl, for sex ratio in the adult worm population  and packed cell volume after second challenge , were discovered using linkage analysis with snp data.

previously many studies have focussed specifically on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which contain interferon gamma  and the major histocompatibility complex  region respectively. the snp <dig> beadchip contains four snp within the ifng locus ; the maximum win <dig> –log <dig>  in the region was  <dig> , which was only slightly higher than the genome-wide average of  <dig> . the romney and perendale fst peaks were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which when compared to the genome wide distributions  is fairly low. both romney and perendale selection lines showed no obvious signals of selection on the other common candidate region, the mhc region on chromosome  <dig>  with a chromosome-wide win <dig> –log <dig>  peak of  <dig> . while this value is reasonably high when compared to the genome-wide distribution , the highest ranked snp in the region, going by win <dig> –log <dig> , was 167th .

four regions  contained genes that have previously been implicated or are candidates for resistance or susceptibility to gastrointestinal nematodes; oar  <dig> , oar  <dig> , oar  <dig>  and oar  <dig> .

the leukocyte surface antigen cd <dig> contributes to the transduction of cd2-generated signals in t cells and natural killer  cells  <cit> . nk cells have been shown to produce significant amounts of il- <dig>  which contributes to eosinophil recruitment in an in vivo mouse model of allergic inflammation  <cit> , and may also be involved in t-cell-independent eosinophil recruitment after helminth infections  <cit> . the cd <dig> protein forms functional interactions with prominent leukocyte receptors including mhc molecules and the surface of b cells  <cit> , and has been shown to be down-regulated upon stimulation of human neutrophils with tnf-α  <cit> . in humans cd <dig> deficiency has been associated with recurrent infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses  <cit> , and polymorphisms in the gene have been associated with regulation of tnf-α levels  <cit> ; up-regulation of tnf-α has been observed in the abomasal lymph node of sheep challenged with t. circumcincta 5 days after infection  <cit> , and abomasal mucosa of resistant drb1* <dig> carrier lambs at 3 days post infection  <cit> .

chitinases are a group of digestive enzymes that break down glycosidic bonds in chitin, which is present in fungi and the exoskeletal elements of some animals, including nematodes and arthropods  <cit> . mammalian chitinases and chitinase-like proteins are known to be up-regulated and secreted in th <dig> induced inflammatory responses, including nematode infection  <cit>  suggesting these genes are plausible candidate genes for mediating resistance status.

chia
 <cit>  has previously been associated with the development of the immune response in mammals and control of helminth infection  <cit> . induction of chia is via a th <dig> specific, il- <dig> mediated pathway, and has been implicated in th <dig> dominated disorders such as asthma  <cit> . in mice it has been shown that chitin is a recognition element for tissue infiltration by innate immune cells implicated in allergic and helminth immunity  and this process can be negatively regulated by a vertebrate chitinase  <cit> . despite this, there is no evidence in the literature that chia has previously been implicated in increased resistance or susceptibility to gastrointestinal parasites in ungulates.

chitinase-like proteins can bind chitin, however, due to mutations in their active domains they do not have chitinolytic enzyme activity  <cit> . the chitinase-like molecule, chi3l <dig>  has been shown to be up-regulated in the abomasum of sheep in response to t. circumcincta challenge of previously infected animals  <cit> . chia expression levels were also examined in the same study, and while expression was observed up-regulation of transcripts was not significant. expression of chi3l <dig>  has been observed in the abomasum of  <dig> and 21 week old steers exposed to ostertagia ostertagi
 <cit> . expression also been observed in the abomasal lymph node of resistant and susceptible blackface lambs infected with t. circumcincta in comparison to sham-infected controls  <cit> . in human macrophages chi3l <dig> has been found to be upregulated by il- <dig> and tgf-β  <cit> .

while the th1/th <dig> dichotomy has not been proven in sheep, the components involved in response to gastrointestinal parasite infection are typical of a th <dig> pathway; immunity is associated with the production of th2-associated cytokines, increased numbers of mast cells, peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, and elevated production of multiple antibody isotypes . hrh <dig> is predominantly expressed on th <dig> cells, in an il3-upregulatable manner  <cit> . mice lacking hrh <dig> had lower percentages of interferon-γ -producing cells, and produced higher levels of antigen-specific igg <dig> and ige. mice lacking either hrh <dig> or hrh <dig> tended to have a higher frequency of il4-producing cells. jutel et al.  <cit>  concluded that histamine secreted from mast cells and basophils potently influences th <dig> and th <dig> responses, as well as antibody isotypes, as a regulatory loop in inflammatory reactions. in blackface lambs challenged over a period of three months with t. circumcincta, significantly increased levels of hrh <dig> expression in the abomasal lymph node were observed  <cit> .

while the genes dennd2d, reln and nsun <dig> do not have obvious roles in immunity, they have previously been reported as being upregulated in susceptible animals. the dennd2d protein was found to be more abundant in genetically susceptible sheep following infection by h. contortus
 <cit> . reln was upregulated in suffolk  compared to texel  animals three days post infection with t. circumcincta
 <cit> . finally, in a study comparing gene expression in the duodenum following natural infection of lambs from the perendale selection lines used in this study, nsun <dig> was found to be more highly expressed in susceptible animals  <cit> .

for complex traits, where many loci of small to moderate effect are likely to influence phenotype, the  <dig>  snp available for ovine analysis, which are also biased to high maf snp, may not provide enough information. in sheep, single markers were estimated to explain a maximum of  <dig> % or  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance in fec following challenge with either t. colubriformis or h. contortus respectively  <cit> . it has been suggested in cattle, based on the fst difference between adjacent loci, that  <dig>  evenly spaced snp would be required to study selective signatures across the bovine genome  <cit> .

in humans, the search for selective sweeps is aided by a large number of densely spaced snp, with over  <dig>  million snp available from phase ii of the hapmap project   <cit> . densely spaced snp give greater power when using statistical tests that rely on linkage disequilibrium , as signals of selection are less likely to be lost. the snp <dig> beadchip, while providing uniform genome-wide coverage, is estimated to have only one marker every 46 kb. fine-mapping, where more snp are genotyped in an area of interest using, for example, sequenom® technology, allows further analysis of ld in areas that appear to be under selection. with the information obtained from more snp, definition of ld in the area increases, improving the ability to be able to localise causal variants using numerous statistical methods, such as ihs and xp-ehh, that have been developed to identify signatures left in the genome by selection.

as previously discussed the snp <dig> beadchip has already been used to map causal mutations for traits controlled by a single locus, and furthermore used to validate and detect selection sweeps in sheep  <cit> . while it is perhaps surprising that only two of the regions under selection correlated with a previously identified qtl, this lends support to the widely held theory that parasite resistance is under the control of many loci with a moderate effect. new genomic approaches, including the snp <dig> beadchip, and sequencing of whole genomes  <cit>  and transcriptomes  <cit> , provide an opportunity to rapidly look for and find genome-wide signals of selection  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
genome wide analysis of selection signatures revealed  <dig> regions, which included genes involved in chitinase activity and the cytokine response. many of the signals of selection found in this study are novel observations; further knowledge of the genes involved in gastrointestinal parasite resistance or susceptibility can only increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved.
