BACKGROUND
abscisic acid  is a phytohormone that controls seed germination, seedling growth and seed development  <cit> . in particular, aba plays an essential role in the protective responses of plants to adverse environmental conditions, such as drought, high salinity and extreme temperatures  <cit> .

at the molecular level, aba-dependent processes entail changes in gene expression patterns. numerous genes are either up- or down-regulated by aba in seedlings  <cit> . the aba regulation of these genes is generally at the transcriptional level, and a number of cis-regulatory elements responsible for the regulation by aba have been determined  <cit> . one of the cis-elements consists of acgtggc core sequence. the element, which is similar to the g-box  present in many light-regulated promoters  <cit> , is ubiquitous among aba-regulated gene promoters and generally known as aba response element . although necessary, a single copy of the g-box type abre is not sufficient to mediate aba regulation, and multiple copies of abre or combinations of abre with another cis-element are required for the full aba-induction of genes. for instance, an element known as ce <dig>  is required for the aba-induction of barley hva <dig> and osem genes  <cit> . thus, ce <dig> and abre constitute an aba response complex. another coupling element, ce <dig> , is necessary for the aba-regulation of hva <dig> gene  <cit> . in rd29a gene, dre  functions as a coupling element to abre  <cit> .

a subfamily of bzip proteins has been identified that mediate the aba response via the g-box type abre in arabidopsis  <cit> . referred to as abfs or arebs, these proteins not only bind the abre but also mediate stress-responsive aba regulation in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> . on the other hand, abi <dig>  which belongs to the same subfamily of bzip proteins as abfs/arebs  <cit> , mediates aba response in the embryo. abfs/arebs were isolated based on their binding to abre. subsequent study showed that they also bind the coupling element ce <dig>  <cit> , which is functionally equivalent to abre  <cit> .

the transcription factors that bind the ce <dig> element have not been reported yet. among the known transcription factors involved in aba response, abi <dig> has been shown to bind the ce <dig> element  <cit> . however, the preferred binding site of abi <dig> is caccg, which differs from the ce <dig> element consensus ccacc. thus, it has been suggested that ap <dig> domain proteins other than abi <dig> would interact with ce <dig>  <cit> .

to isolate ce <dig> element binding factors, we conducted yeast one-hybrid screens. from the screen of  <dig>  million yeast transformants, we isolated  <dig> positive clones. analysis of the clones revealed that a group of ap2/erf domain proteins bind the ce <dig> element in yeast. most of the ce <dig> binding factors  belong to the b- <dig> or the a- <dig> subfamily of ap2/erf domain proteins  <cit> . we also found that overexpression of some of the cebfs alters aba and/or sugar responses in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
isolation of ce1-binding proteins
to isolate genes encoding the proteins that bind the ce <dig> element, we conducted yeast one-hybrid screens  <cit> . a trimer of the ce <dig> element was cloned in front of the minimal promoters of the lacz and the his <dig> reporter genes, respectively. the reporter constructs were then introduced into a yeast strain to create reporter yeast, which was subsequently transformed with cdna library dna. the library was prepared from mrna isolated from aba-and salt-treated arabidopsis seedlings. the resulting transformants were screened for reporter activities. from the screen of  <dig>  million yeast transformants, we obtained  <dig> positive clones and analyzed more than  <dig> clones.

grouping of the positive clones based on their insert restriction patterns and subsequent dna sequencing revealed that they encode a group of ap2/erf superfamily transcription factors . twelve isolates encoded aterf <dig> , ten isolates encoded erf <dig>  and nine isolates encoded rap <dig>  . other multiple or single isolate encoded aterf <dig> , aterf <dig> , aterf <dig>  and seven other ap2/erf family proteins. among the  <dig> ap2/erf proteins isolated, nine belong to the b- <dig> subfamily, three belong to the a- <dig> subfamily and one belongs to the b- <dig> subfamily. thus, a group of ap2/erf proteins, especially those belonging to the subgroup b- <dig>  was isolated as ce1-binding factors in our one-hybrid screen. we designated the proteins cebfs .

a grouping is according to sakuma et al.  <cit> .

dna-binding and transcriptional activities of cebfs
binding of a number of cebfs, which were isolated as multiple isolates , to the ce <dig> element was confirmed in yeast. plasmid dna was isolated from the positive clones, and their binding to ce <dig> was determined by investigating their ability to activate the ce1-containing lacz reporter gene. figure 1a shows the results obtained with six different positive clones: aterf <dig>  aterf <dig>  aterf <dig>  aterf <dig>  rap <dig>  and rap <dig> . the four aterfs, which belong to the b- <dig> subfamily, could activate the reporter gene containing the ce <dig> element but not the reporter gene lacking the ce <dig> element. the ce1-dependent reporter activation was observed with medium containing galactose but not with the medium containing glucose. thus, reporter activation was also dependent on the presence of galactose, which is an inducer of the gal <dig> promoter that drives the expression of the cdna clones. similarly, rap <dig>  and rap <dig> , which belong to the b- <dig> and the a- <dig> subfamily, respectively, could also activate the reporter gene, and the activation was ce1- and galactose-dependent.

cebfs are putative transcription factors; accordingly, we wanted to determine if they possess transcriptional activity. to accomplish this, the transcriptional activity of cebfs was examined employing a yeast assay system. the coding regions of seven cebfs were individually cloned in frame with the lexa db in the vector ppc62lexa  <cit> . the hybrid constructs were then introduced into the yeast strain l <dig>  which carries a lacz reporter gene with an upstream lexa operator in its promoter. figure 1b shows that aterf <dig> has the highest transcriptional activity among the seven cebfs. rap <dig>  also possesses high transcriptional activity, while rap <dig> , rap <dig> l , aterf <dig> and aterf <dig> displayed relatively lower transcriptional activity. aterf <dig> was found to have very low transcriptional activity.

expression patterns of cebfs
the expression patterns of nine cebfs in seedlings were examined by coupled reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction . because the tissue-specific expression patterns of many ap2/erf domain proteins have been reported  <cit> , we focused on the aba and stress induction patterns of cebfs. figure 2a shows that the expression of aterf <dig>  aterf <dig>  aterf <dig> and aterf <dig> was induced by high salt. in the case of aterf <dig>  its expression was also induced by high osmolarity . the expression of other cebfs was largely constitutive or their induction levels were very low.

for aterf <dig>  rap <dig>  and at1g <dig>  which was designated rap <dig> l  because of its high similarity to rap <dig> , we examined their tissue-specific expression patterns in detail by investigating their promoter activity. transgenic plants harboring the promoter-gus reporter constructs were prepared, and histochemical gus staining was carried out to determine their temporal and spatial expression patterns.

with aterf <dig>  gus activity was observed only in the shoot meristemic region and the emerging young leaves in seedlings . thus, aterf <dig> expression in seedlings was specific to the shoot meristem region. during the reproductive stage, gus activity was observed in the carpels. on the other hand, gus activity was observed in most of the tissues with the rap <dig> l promoter . gus activity was not observed in the immature embryo, but it is detected in the mature embryo and most of the seedling tissues. the gus activity was strong in most of the tissues, although relatively weaker activity was observed in young leaves and the lateral root tips including the meristem and the elongation zone. strong gus activity was also observed in reproductive organs such as sepals, filaments, style and abscission zone. the gus staining pattern of the transgenic plants harboring the rap <dig>  promoter construct was similar to that of the plants harboring the rap <dig> l promoter construct . in general, stronger gus activity was observed with the rap <dig>  promoter, and, unlike the rap <dig> l promoter, its activity was detected in the emerging young leaves.

to obtain further clues to the function of aterf <dig>  rap <dig> l and rap <dig> , we determined their subcellular localization. the coding regions of the cebfs were individually fused to eyfp under the control of the  <dig> s promoter, and the localization of the fusion proteins was examined after agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves. figure 2e shows that yfp signal is detected in the nucleus with the aterf <dig> construct. similarly, the yfp signal was also observed in the nucleus with rap <dig> l and rap <dig> . thus, our results indicate that aterf <dig>  rap <dig> l and rap <dig>  are localized in the nucleus.

in vivo functions of cebfs
our transcriptional assay  showed that aterf <dig> has the highest transcriptional activity among cebfs, and its expression was highly inducible by high salt . hence, we chose aterf <dig> for functional analysis. to determine the in vivo function of aterf <dig>  we generated its overexpression  lines. the coding region of aterf <dig> was fused to the camv  <dig> s promoter employing the pbi <dig> vector  <cit> , and after transformation of arabidopsis, t <dig> or t <dig> generation transgenic plants were recovered and used for phenotype analysis.

aterf <dig> ox lines exhibited minor growth retardation , and mature plants were slightly smaller than the wild type plants . however, other than minor dwarfism, the overall growth pattern was normal. because the ce <dig> element is an aba response element, we determined the aba-associated phenotypes to address whether aterf <dig> overexpression affected aba response. the germination rates of the transgenic plants were slightly slower  in aba-free medium , but the aba sensitivity of the transgenic seed germination was similar to that of the wild type plants .

unlike the seed germination, postgermination growth of the aterf <dig> ox lines exhibited altered aba response. figure 3b and figure 3c show that shoot development of the transgenic plants was inhibited severely at low concentrations of aba. for instance, cotyledons of less than 50% of the transgenic plants turned green at  <dig>  μm aba, and true leaf development was not observed with any of the transgenic plants. by contrast, shoot development of wild type seedlings was not affected significantly by the same concentration of aba. similarly, root growth of the aterf <dig> ox lines was also severely inhibited at  <dig>  μm aba, whereas root growth of the wild type plants was affected much less . thus, postgermination growth of the aterf <dig> ox lines was hypersensitive to aba.

we next examined the glucose sensitivity of the aterf <dig> ox lines. glucose inhibits shoot development, i.e., cotyledong greening and true leaf development, and the inhibition process is mediated by aba  <cit> . figure 3e and figure 3f show that glucose-dependent arrest of shoot development was much more severe in the aterf <dig> ox lines. at 3% glucose, cotyledon greening of the wild type plants was not affected noticeably. by contrast, cotyledon greening efficiency of the transgenic plants was reduced to approximately 50%. at 4% glucose, shoot development was observed with approximately 50% of the wild type plants, whereas less than 10% of the ox lines develop green cotyledons. thus, our results indicated that aterf <dig> ox lines are hypersensitive to glucose. we did not observe changes in mannitol  or salt  response in parallel experiments, suggesting that the effect is glucose-specific.

we conducted similar experiments to investigate the in vivo function of rap <dig> l, which belongs to the a- <dig> subfamily and whose function has not been reported yet. rap <dig> l ox lines were constructed, and their phenotypes were scored to address its involvement in aba response. the transgenic plants displayed minor growth retardation , but no distinct changes in aba sensitivity were observed. on the other hand, the rap <dig> l ox lines displayed altered response to glucose. figure 4b and figure 4c show that shoot development of the rap <dig> l ox lines was more severely inhibited by 3% and 4% glucose than the wild type plants. as mentioned above, rap <dig>  is highly homologous to rap <dig> l. therefore, we prepared rap <dig>  ox lines and analyzed their phenotypes as well . we did not observe changes in aba sensitivity; however, similar to rap <dig> l ox lines, the rap <dig>  ox lines were hypersensitive to glucose . we also examined the salt tolerance of rap <dig> l and rap <dig>  ox lines. the results showed that postgermination growth, i.e., cotyledon greening and true leaf development of both transgenic lines was more severely inhibited at  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl than wild type plants. the salt sensitivity of rap <dig>  ox lines was more pronounced than that of rap <dig> l. we did not observe changes in mannitol sensitivity in either the rap <dig>  or the rap <dig> l ox lines .

to further confirm their involvements in aba response, we analyzed knockout lines of rap <dig> l and rap <dig>  and rnai lines of aterf <dig>  we did not observe distinct phenotypes with the transgenic plants, presumably because of the functional redundancy among cebfs.

to investigate the target genes of aterf <dig>  we determined the changes in the expression levels of a number of aba-responsive genes by real-time rt-pcr. among the genes we investigated, the expression level of cor15a increased significantly in the aterf <dig> ox lines . slight increases in adh <dig> expression were also observed. by contrast, rab <dig> expression decreased or increased slightly in the transgenic lines. similar analysis showed that cor15a and adh <dig> expression levels were enhanced in the rap <dig> l and the rap <dig>  ox lines. increase in the rab <dig> expression level was also observed in the rap <dig>  ox line . the three genes whose expression levels were altered in the transgenic lines have the g-box type abres in their promoter regions and are inducible by both aba and various abiotic stresses. additionally, cor15a and rab <dig> genes have a sequence element  that can function as another coupling element, dre, although the ce <dig> core sequence, ccacc, was not found.

discussion
we isolated genes encoding ce <dig> element binding factors  employing a yeast one-hybrid system. cebfs belong to the ap2/erf superfamily of transcription factors  <cit> . the ap2/erf proteins are classified into three families: ap <dig>  erf and rav. whereas ap <dig> and rav family members possess an additional ap <dig> or b <dig> dna-binding domain, erf family members possess a single ap2/erf domain. the erf family is further divided into two subgroups, the dreb/cbf subfamily  and the erf subfamily   <cit> . among the  <dig> positive clones we analyzed,  <dig> encoded b group proteins , whereas  <dig> encoded a group proteins  .

the in vitro binding sites of many ap2/erf superfamily proteins have been studied in detail. the dre core sequence, i.e., the binding site for dreb1a and dreb2a, which are representative members of the dreb/cbf subfamily, is a/gccgac  <cit> . the gcc box core sequence, which is the consensus binding site for erf family members, is agccgcc  <cit> . thus, the two sequences share the ccgnc consensus sequence, the central g being essential for high affinity binding. on the other hand, the core sequence of the ce <dig> element is ccacc, which differs from the dre and the gcc box core sequences. the results of our one-hybrid screen indicate that a subset of ap2/erf family members  bind the ce <dig> element in yeast.

several of the cebfs have been reported as gcc box binding proteins. for example, the preferred in vitro binding site of aterf <dig>  aterf <dig> and aterf <dig> is the wild type gcc box, agccgcc  <cit> . mutations of the gs at the second and fifth positions reduced their binding activity to less than 10% of that obtained with the wild type sequence. similarly, the mutation of the second g of the core sequence greatly reduced the in vitro binding of rap <dig>   <cit> . however, in our one-hybrid screen, aterf <dig>  aterf <dig> and rap <dig>  were isolated as multiple isolates . the result suggests that these proteins can interact with the non-gcc box sequence, ccacc, under physiological conditions .

ap2/erf proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . many dreb/cbf family proteins  are involved in aba-independent abiotic stress responses  <cit> , whereas erf family members  are generally involved in ethylene and pathogen defense responses  <cit> . in particular, several of the ap2/erf proteins are involved in aba response. abi <dig>  which belongs to the dreb/cbf subfamily, is a positive regulator of aba and sugar responses  <cit> . dreb2c and maize dbf <dig> are also positive regulators of aba response  <cit> . on the other hand, aterf <dig>  <cit> , abr <dig>  <cit>  and aterf <dig>  <cit>  are erf subfamily proteins that are negative regulators of aba response.

to determine the in vivo functions of cebfs in aba response, we generated their ox lines and acquired knockout lines for phenotype analysis when available. as mentioned above, several cebfs  are known to regulate defense responses. however, their involvement in aba response and the functions of other cebfs have not been reported yet. here, we present our results obtained with cebfs, aterf <dig> and rap <dig> l. aterf <dig> was found to possess very high transcriptional activity in yeast  and localized in the nucleus. its expression was limited to the shoot meristem region and young emerging leaves , implying that it may play a role in shoot growth or development. consistent with this notion, aterf <dig> ox lines exhibited minor dwarfism . the growth retardation observed in the ox lines may reflect the normal inhibitory role of aterf <dig> or be the result of its ectopic overexpression. however, we think that aterf <dig> probably play a role in growth regulation. because we could not obtain its knockout lines, we prepared and analyzed its rnai lines. our results showed that the rnai lines grew faster than wild type plants , suggesting that aterf <dig> may inhibit seedling growth.

overexpression of aterf <dig> conferred aba hypersensitivity during postgermination growth. as shown in figure  <dig> both shoot and root growth was severely inhibited by the low concentration of aba, which had little effect on wild type seedling growth. additionally, the aterf <dig> ox lines were hypersensitive to glucose, whose effect is mediated by aba. we did not carry out extensive expression analysis of aba-responsive genes in aterf <dig> ox lines. however, our limited target gene analysis showed that expression of several aba-responsive genes was affected by aterf <dig> . thus, our results strongly suggest that aterf <dig> may be involved in aba response. as mentioned in the results, we did not observe distinct phenotypes with aterf <dig> rnai lines except faster seedling growth, presumably because of the functional redundancy among cebfs.

in the case of rap <dig> l, we did not observe changes in aba sensitivity in its ox lines, although we observed up-regulation of several aba-responsive genes . however, the transgenic lines were glucose-hypersensitive, suggesting that it may be involved in sugar response . we also analyzed its knockout lines, but did not observe distinct phenotypes . rap <dig>  is the closest homologue of rap <dig> l; therefore, we also analyzed its ox and knockout phenotypes. we did not observe alterations in aba response in either the ox or the knockout lines of rap <dig>  . the results are consistent with those observed by lin et al.  <cit> , who reported that rap <dig>  is involved in light, ethylene and aba-independent drought tolerance but not in aba response. however, similar to rap <dig> l ox lines, rap <dig>  ox lines were glucose-sensitive and both rap <dig>  and rap <dig> l ox lines were salt-sensitive . additionally, single or double knockout lines of rap <dig>  and rap <dig> l grew faster than wild type plants , suggesting their role in seedling growth control.

it is not known whether other cebfs are involved in aba response. another important question to be addressed is the mechanism of their function, if they are involved in aba response. ce <dig> constitutes an aba response complex with the g-box type abre and functions in combination with abre. therefore, cebfs are expected to interact with the transcription factors abfs/arebs, which mediate aba response in seedlings via the g-box type abre. in the case of dreb2c, which binds another coupling element dre, its physical interaction with abfs/arebs has been demonstrated  <cit> . it would be worthwhile to determine whether cebfs can physically interact with abfs/arebs. as described before, several cebfs mediate plant defense response. thus, our results raise an interesting possibility that ce <dig> may be a converging point of aba and defense responses.

CONCLUSIONS
we conducted one-hybrid screen to isolate proteins that interact with the coupling element ce <dig> and isolated a group of ap2/erf superfamily proteins designated as cebfs. to determine the function of cebfs, we examined their expression patterns and prepared ox lines for phenotype analysis. our results showed that the aterf <dig> ox lines are aba-and glucose-hypersensitive. the ox lines of two other cebfs, rpa <dig>  and rap <dig> l, were glucose-hypersensitive. thus, overexpression of the three cebfs resulted in alterations in aba and/or sugar response. in addition, several aba-regulated genes were up-regulated in the transgenic lines. taken together, our data strongly suggest that the three cebfs evaluated in this study are involved in aba or stress response. the functions of other cebfs remain to be determined.
