BACKGROUND
plasminogen, the proenzyme precursor of the primary fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, is a single-chain protein containing of  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . while plasminogen is expressed in all major organs and tissues, it is synthesized primarily in the liver  <cit> . plasminogen is found in significant quantities in extravascular fluids  <cit> . circulating plasminogen comprises a pan-apple  domain, five kringle domains , and a serine protease  domain  <cit> . under physiological conditions, plasminogen is converted to plasmin by a cleavage event that occurs in its activation loop , which is facilitated by tissue plasminogen activator  or urokinase plasminogen activator . the plasmin molecule is a two-chain, disulfide-linked sp with trypsin-like specificity. the c-terminal light chain of plasmin  25 kda) contains a typical sp that is homologous to trypsin. the c-terminal light chain also contains the classic catalytic triad, which is composed of his <dig>  asp <dig>  and ser <dig> 

plasmin can undergo an autolytic process, and its cleavage site specificity can change with ph. the specific autolytic cleavage of the plasmin molecule in alkaline solutions leads to the formation of a low-molecular-weight form of plasmin, termed microplasmin  <cit> . human microplasmin , which was first prepared from plasmin in an alkaline solution, consists of two polypeptide chains that are connected by disulfide bonds. one polypeptide is the b chain of plasmin that consists of  <dig> amino acids, while the other peptide is the c-terminal portion of the a chain of plasmin, which consists of  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . microplasmin has a molecular weight of 28 kda, as calculated from its primary sequence. it is slightly more positively charged than plasminogen, and it is generally a more hydrophobic molecule  <cit> .

the dissolution of blood clots, whether accomplished physiologically or pharmacologically, is facilitated by plasmin  <cit> . plasmin was first studied more than 50 years ago, and it was found to be either ineffective or inferior to plasminogen activators in treating thrombotic diseases  <cit> . with the current widespread use of catheters to deliver thrombolytic therapy, plasmin has been reevaluated as a potentially valuable thrombolytic agent; pharmacological studies have demonstrated plasmin is an effective and hemostatically-safe application for the treatment of thrombotic diseases  <cit> . in addition to fibrin, plasmin has been shown to directly degrade other extracellular matrix  components, including laminin and fibronectin, which have a postulated role in vitreoretinal adhesion  <cit> . in both enucleated pig and human eyes, the addition of  <dig> u of plasmin eliminates the cortical vitreous remnants previously detected on the inner limiting membrane, all without the use of adjunctive techniques  <cit> .

however, the isolation of autologous plasmin is a costly and time-consuming process. furthermore, it is difficult to produce plasmin via recombinant gene technology because of its high molecular weight and tendency to degrade  <cit> . therefore, the availability of lower molecular weight and more stable microplasminogen  represents a valuable tool that might be applied to the treatment of thrombotic diseases and vitreoretinopathies . in response to this need, we developed a protocol to produce abundant quantities of highly active and high-purity rhμplg  from pichia pastoris.

RESULTS
construction of plasmid ppic9k-hμplg
a full-length dna sequence of the synthetic hμplg gene was inserted into the open reading frame of the α-factor signal sequence of the p. pastoris expression vector ppic9k, which is under the regulation of the aox <dig> promoter . this plasmid was transformed into escherichia coli dh5α to express hμplg. enzyme digestion demonstrated that the hμplg gene was correctly oriented in the ppic9k vector . dna sequencing of the recombinant vector confirmed the accuracy of the reading frame of hμplg, and p. pastoris gs <dig> positive transformants were successfully identified. the plasmid ppic9k-hμplg contained a 783-bp inserted target fragment. the deduced mature cdna sequence of rhμplg encodes a 261-amion acid peptide with a theoretical mw of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> .

transformation and screening of transformants
after linearization with sali, ppic9k-hμplg was transformed into p. pastoris gs <dig> competent cells by electroporation. after an initial selection of his + transformants, clones were grown in microtiter plates until they reached the same optical density. the cultures were then spotted onto yeast extract-peptone-dextrose -geneticin plates  and scored for geneticin resistance. five transformants, b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig>  were obtained on the ypd-geneticin plates. after genomic dna was isolated from p. pastoris recombinants and controls, polymerase chain reaction  verification of the positive recombinants was performed using 5′ and 3′ aox <dig> sequencing primers. two bands were obtained for ppic9k-hμplg: one corresponding to the size of the hμplg gene plus the inserted aox <dig> gene in ppic9k , and the other corresponding to the aox <dig> gene in the chromosome of p. pastoris.

expression of rhμplg in a shaker flask and a 5-l bioreactor
the selected transformants  were cultured in a shaker flask to measure rhμplg expression. maximum expression was observed after 4 days of methanol induction at 30 °c. supernatant proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis . as shown in fig.  <dig>  a predominant band at approximately 35 kda was observed in lanes 1– <dig>  no target band was detected in the cultures of an induced transformant harboring an empty ppic9k plasmid. gs <dig> f <dig> showed a distinctive band , with a yield that reached  <dig>  mg/l after 96 h of induction. therefore, gs <dig> f <dig> was used for the subsequent expression of rhμplg.fig.  <dig> production of rhμplg in p. pastoris gs <dig> using a shaker flask. this figures shows the sds-page analysis of rhμplg in fermentation supernatants from different transformants induced for 96 h in shaker flask cultures. lanes 1–5a are loaded with 20 μl of fermentation supernatants from different transformants; lane m contains 10 μl of molecular mass standards



as shown in fig. 2a, fermentation was conducted in a 5-l bioreactor. the culture medium was collected and centrifuged every 5 h to obtain supernatants. recombinant protein expression started 5 h after methanol induction and reached a peak at 40 h . at the end of the glycerol fed-batch phase, the biomass concentration reached 90 g/l. the methanol fed-batch phase of rhμplg production lasted for 40 h, and the final biomass concentration reached 190 g/l, while the volume of the supernatant increased to  <dig>  l. after 40 h of induction, the total secreted protein concentration was  <dig>  g/l, and the rhμplg activity in the supernatant reached  <dig>  u/ml, which was  <dig> times that of the shaker flask fermentation.fig.  <dig> expression and purification of rhμplg. a, sds-page analysis of rhμplg expressed by fed-batch fermentation. lane  <dig>  standard protein marker ; lane  <dig>  uninduced p. pastoris; lanes 2– <dig>  p. pastoris induced with methanol for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 40 h. b, m, standard protein marker. lane  <dig>  gel-filtration chromatography wash fraction; lane  <dig>  cation-exchange chromatography wash fraction 3; lane  <dig>  western blot of rhμplg



purification of rhμplg
the concentration of rhμplg in the bioreactor culture supernatant was estimated to be  <dig>  g/l based on sds-page. the rhμplg expressed by p. pastoris was purified to homogeneity by ultrafiltration, followed by cation-exchange and superdex  <dig> gel-filtration chromatography. the culture supernatant was collected and concentrated using membrane ultrafiltration. subsequently, concentrated supernatant was loaded onto an sp sepharose fast flow column, which bound most of the rhμplg . rhμplg was eluted at  <dig>  mol/l in nacl-acetate buffer. rhμplg was further purified via high-resolution gel-filtration chromatography to remove trace impurities. finally, we obtained 167 mg of purified rhμplg per liter of culture supernatant . the specific activity of purified rhμplg reached  <dig>  u/mg protein . the eluates containing rhμplg were analyzed using sds-page, followed by western blotting using a polyclonal antibody. the purity of rhμplg reached 96 %, as determined by sds-page .

characterization of rhμplg
n-terminal sequencing indicated that the  <dig> amino acid residues at the n-terminus of rhμplg were klydycdvpq, which matched the deduced amino acid sequence of mature hμplg. we determined that the secreted active protein contained  <dig> amino acids, which is consistent with the size of full-length hμplg.

mass spectrometry analysis
an accurate mass can be detected by intact mass analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . peaks corresponding to various protonated rhμplg species were determined. the mass analysis determined that rhμplg has a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda . this is identical to that identified by sds-page.fig.  <dig> molecular mass determination of purified rhμplg by lc-ms. peaks corresponding to various protonated rhμplg species are marked. the mass analysis determined that rhμplg has a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda



amidolytic assays and kinetic analysis
both plasmin and rhμplg possess amidolytic activity against chromogenic substrates. the kinetic parameters km, kcat, and kcat/km for such substrates are summarized in table  <dig>  the km of substrate hydrolysis by rhμplg was comparable to that by human plasmin , suggesting that kringle domains 1– <dig> had no effect on the catalytic activity of plasmin. we also found that rhμplg had higher kcat/km values than plasmin. the difference in the kcat/km values of the two proteinases was caused mainly by a variance in kcat , which implied that there was a structural difference between the two proteins, probably owing to the closed conformation of plasmin. in addition, both serine proteases hydrolyzed a fibrin plate in a concentration-dependent manner, with slightly higher area values for rhμplg .table  <dig> kinetic parameters: comparison of plasminogen and rhμplg

discussion
plasminogen and its active form  play important physiological and pathological roles in fibrinolysis and hemostasis, the degradation of the ecm, cell migration, tissue remodeling, wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumor cell migration  <cit> . consequently, patients with severe plasminogen deficiency typically suffer from a range of difficult to treat inflammatory conditions, including ligneous conjunctivitis, gingivitis, and neural disorders  <cit> . activation of the plasminogen system is tightly regulated, which is necessary to prevent the development of a systemic fibrinolytic state or tumor metastasis. the availability of rhμplg with full enzymatic activity could be extremely valuable for structure-function studies of plasminogen and plasmin. in addition, its truncated derivative is also needed for various important therapeutic applications, including catheter-directed thrombolysis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke  <cit> , acute lower extremity arterial or bypass graft occlusion  <cit> , acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis  <cit>  enzyme-induced vitreolysis, alleviating the progression of diabetic retinopathy  <cit> , and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in young adults  <cit> .

rhμplg has been expressed at high levels as inclusion bodies in e. coli  <cit> . recently, the methylotrophic yeast p. pastoris has been considered to be an excellent host for producing proteins obtained from different sources  <cit> . as a eukaryote, p. pastoris has many advantages. proteins produced by p. pastoris are more likely to be processed, properly folded, and chemically modified. high expression levels, high cell densities in culture, easier upscaling, and strong and tightly regulated promoters have all been identified as advantages of using p. pastoris as a host  <cit> . in this study, rhμplg was expressed in p. pastoris, which was achieved by expressing rhμplg , which lacks the five kringle domains. this method produced high yields  of protein, which could be purified to homogeneity. the mw of rhμplg was different from that of the microplasmins produced by nagai et al. and joshi et al.  <cit> , both of which lacked 12 n-terminal amino acids.

in this study, we cloned the cdna gene of hμplg into a ppic9k vector that contained an α-factor secretion signal and allowed for the expression of hμplg in p. pastoris gs <dig>  transformants were selected based on their ability to grow on a medium lacking histidine, as well as on their geneticin resistance. enzymatically active rhμplg, which had a mw of  <dig>  kda, was expressed. then, we developed a preparation of rhμplg that was suitable for pharmaceutical use. the final, optimized process consists of a sequence of three chromatography steps. the first step  desalts and exchanges the buffer to acetate buffer, while the second step  captures rhμplg and allows contaminants to flow through. a gel filtration/diafiltration step then serves to transfer the recombinant protein into its formulation buffer . the final concentration was 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline . a preliminary characterization of rhμplg was performed using western blotting, high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and n-terminal sequencing to verify the identity of the protein. we also completed a partial characterization of the functional properties of rhμplg by comparing its serine protease activity to that of commercially available plasmin. our assays showed that when using an amidolytic chromophogenic substrate, the km value of rhμplg was similar to that of plasmin . the catalytic efficiency, kcat/km, was higher for rhμplg than plasmin. rhμplg, at a concentration similar to that of plasmin, exhibited a higher area value in the fibrinolysis plate, suggesting that kringle domains 1– <dig> have no effect on the catalytic activity of plasmin.

the development of rhμplg may solve most of the problems associated with the treatment of vitreoretinopathies with autologous plasmin. rhμplg contains only the enzymatic portion of the plasmin molecule, while the other domains are omitted. this makes rhμplg much smaller than the original molecule  while retaining the same enzymatic activity, which theoretically would allow for greater penetration into epiretinal tissues. rhμplg has other advantages over plasmin. first, it is commercially available, allowing investigators to avoid the time-consuming and expensive steps necessary for the production of autologous plasmin enzyme. second, it is generated by recombinant techniques, ensuring its sterility while avoiding the risk of microbial contamination. last, it is inherently more stable than plasmin and can be stored in citrate buffer prior to use  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that high-purity rhμplg  can be abundantly produced by p. pastoris. after purification and identification of rhμplg, we observed fibrinolytic activity in vitro, which suggested that rhμplg might play an active and beneficial role in treating thrombotic diseases and controlling the progression of vitreoretinopathies. therefore, the possibility of producing rhμplg for use in therapeutic applications could be fulfilled by p. pastoris. the successful expression of rhμplg in p. pastoris lays a solid foundation for its possible future applications.
