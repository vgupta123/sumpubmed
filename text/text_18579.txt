BACKGROUND
pairwise protein sequence alignment methods have been essential tools for many important bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence database search, homology recognition, protein structure prediction and protein function prediction . following the development of global and local alignment methods of aligning two single sequences , profile-sequence alignment or profile-profile alignment methods such as psi-blast, sam  <cit> , hmmer  <cit> , hhsearch, hhsuite , which enrich two single sequences with their homologous sequences, has substantially improved both the sensitivity of recognizing remote homologs and the accuracy of aligning two protein sequences.

due to their relatively high sensitivity in recognizing remote protein homologs, profile-profile alignment methods have become the default structural template identification method for many template-based protein structure modeling methods and servers . for instance, hhsearch, one of top profile-profile alignment tools based on comparing the profile hidden markov models  of two proteins, was used by almost all the template-based protein structure prediction methods tested during the last two critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction   <cit> . the open source package hhsuite contains both the latest implementation of hhsearch that supports a full hmm-hmm alignment-based search on a hmm profile database and a very fast search tool hhblits  <cit>  that reduces the number of unnecessary full hmm pairwise alignment in order to drastically improve its search speed. moreover, the maximum accuracy  alignment algorithm is applied in hhsuite, but not in hhsearch. in this work, we aim to introduce new sources of information to improve profile-profile alignments with respect to both the original hhsearch package and the open source hhsuite package,

in order to more accurately align the structurally equivalent residues in a target protein and a template protein together, secondary structure information was incorporated into profile-profile sequence alignment methods, yielding the better sensitivity and accuracy  <cit> . aiming to find the new source of information to further improve the sensitivity and accuracy of pairwise profile-profile alignment, we examine the effectiveness of incorporating into profile-profile alignment methods some new features that have not been used in profile-profile alignments before, including protein solvent accessibility, torsion angles, and the evolutionary residue coupling information  <cit> .

specifically, we add the additional scoring terms for solvent accessibility, torsion angles, and evolutionary residue coupling information into the scoring function of hhsuite  <cit>  in order to enhance the alignment process. according to our evaluation, adding solvent accessibility and torsion angles can improve the alignment accuracy, but incorporating the evolutionary residue coupling information is only useful in some cases.

methods
we extended an existing profile-profile alignment method within the standard five-step alignment framework of hhsuite  <cit>  shown in figure  <dig>  including discretization of profile columns, removal of very short or very dissimilar sequences, execution of viterbi alignment and calculation of e-value and probability, realignment based on the maximum accuracy  algorithm, and retrieval of alignments by tracing-back. different from hhsuite, our method applies solvent accessibility and torsion angle information to both the viterbi alignment and the maximum accuracy alignment, and traces back with the aid of the evolutionary residue coupling information. in the following sections, we focus on describing how to incorporate the new features into the profile-profile method , while briefly introducing the necessary technical background.figure  <dig>

adding solvent accessibilities and torsion angles into the viterbi alignment
the score of aligning two columns in two protein profiles  in hhsuite was calculated according to equation .
  <dig>  

in which qi and tj denote the probability of amino acid at position i in the query profile and at position j the template profile, respectively, and f is the background frequency of residue a . the best alignment between two profile hmms was obtained by maximizing the log-sum-odds score slso according to equation .
  <dig>  

where k denotes the index of columns that query hmm q aligned to template hmm t, i and j are the respective columns in q and t, ptr is the product of all transition probabilities for the path through q and t. the latest version of hhsuite has included the secondary structure information into the calculation of the score. in this work, we further augment the calculation of the score by adding the terms to account for the solvent accessibility, and torsion angles.

the viterbi dynamic program algorithm used five matrices sab  representing matching different states  in two hmms to maximize the augmented log-sum-of-odds score slso. they are recursively calculated as:
  <dig>      <dig>    <dig>  

sim and sgd are calculated similarly as smi and sdg.

the difference between equation  above and the default one in hhsuite is that two new terms  were added to utilize the solvent accessibility and torsion angle information. in equation , sss is the secondary structure score between column i in query hmm  and column j in template hmm , which was the same as the one originally used in hhsuite. ssa is the solvent accessibility score between qi and tj, and stors is the torsion angle score between qi and tj, which are the new terms introduced in this work. wss, wsa, and wtors are weights for the secondary structure score, solvent accessibility score and torsion angle score respectively. sshift is the score offset for match-match states. three weights wss, wsa, wtors and shift score sshift are set to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and − <dig>  by default, and can be adjusted by users as well. qi −  <dig> is the transition probability from state m at column i- <dig> to next state m of in the query hmm, and tj −  <dig> is the transition probability from state m at column j- <dig> to next state m in the template hmm.

here we denote this extension of the hhsuite method as hmmsato. hmmsato allows for scoring predicted  solvent accessibilities of one protein against predicted  ones of another protein. dssp  <cit>  is used to parse the true solvent accessibility of a protein if its tertiary structure is known. pspro  <dig>   <cit>  is used to predict the solvent accessibility of a protein. the solvent accessibility information can be automatically parsed or predicted in hmmsato, or alternatively provided by a user. the two types of solvent accessibilities  are employed. assuming the predicted or true solvent accessibility states of the ith residue  of the query protein and the jth residue  of the template protein are sa and sa, the solvent accessibility score between the two residues ssa is defined as:
  <dig>  

the score is calculated by the kronecker-delta function δ, which equals to  <dig> if a = b,  <dig> otherwise.

similarly as the solvent accessibility, the torsion angles including both phi angle  and psi angle  can be automatically predicted by spine-x  <cit>  or provided by a user. the range of both φ and ψ is . given the query sequence x and template sequence y, the predicted phi angle and psi angle of the i-th residue xi in the query are denoted as φ and ψ, and those of the j-th residue yj in the template as φ and ψ. the torsion angle score stors between the two residues is calculated as:
  <dig>  

realign the profiles by maximum accuracy alignment combining solvent accessibility and torsion angles
it has been shown that maximum accuracy  algorithm can generally create a more accurate alignment than the viterbi algorithm, while the latter can generate better alignment scores, e-values and probabilities  <cit> . consequently, the viterbi algorithm is applied to compute e-values and scores, and the mac algorithm is chosen to generate the final hmm-hmm pairwise alignment in hhsato by default.

the maximum accuracy algorithm  <cit>  creates the local alignment that maximizes the sum of probabilities for each residue pair to be aligned minus a penalty   ), where  represents the posterior probability of the match state i in hmm q aligned to the match state j in hmm t. with the parameter mact, users can control the alignment greediness, from nearly global, long alignment  to very precise, short local alignments . the default value of mact is set to  <dig>  in hmmsato as in hhsuite. to find the best mac alignment path, an optimal sub-alignment score matrix as is calculated recursively using the posterior probability  as substitution scores:
  <dig>  

here, the forward-backward algorithm in local or global mode is applied to calculate the posterior probabilities . the forward partition function fmm and backward partition function bmm are introduced to calculate the posterior probability for pair state () according to equation :
  <dig>  

five dynamic programming matrices fab are used to compute the forward partition function fmm, and ab ∈ {mm, mi, im, dg, gd}. the top row and left column of the fmm matrix were initialized to  <dig>  and all the matrices were filled recursively:
    <dig>    

where p min controls the alignment model . fim and fgd are calculated similarly as fmi and fdg. solvent accessibility score ssa and torsion angle score stors are calculated as in the viterbi alignment.

in analogy to the forward partition function, the backward partition function matrix bmm are calculated recursively as follows:
    <dig>    

bim and bgd are calculated similarly as bmi and bdg.

trace back maximum accuracy alignments with the evolutionary residue coupling information
the evolutionary coupling  stands for the correlation between two positions or columns in a multiple protein sequence alignment or a protein profile  <cit> . it has recently been employed to predict residue-residue contacts  <cit> . in order to improve profile-profile alignment with the evolutionary coupling information, we calculate the mutual information   for any two columns  of each profile according to equation .
  <dig>  

n is  <dig>  standing for  <dig> amino acids plus gap. the joint probability of two residues xi and xj ) and the probability of residue xi ) are calculated in the same way as in  <cit> . however, ecij is calculated as the mutual information  instead of the direct information  based on the global probability model  <cit>  in order to achieve the higher time efficiency. a higher ec value corresponds to a stronger correlation between two columns in the given profile.

based on the calculated ec value matrices for both the query and template profiles, top highly correlated position pairs with higher ec values for each profile are selected. the evolutionary residue coupling information is then applied to check the counterpart pairs during the process of tracing back through the sub-alignment score matrix as ) of the mac alignment. specifically, we denote the evolutionary coupled position for position i in query q as kq, and the coupled position of position j in template t as kt. moreover, mq denotes the position in template t matched with position i in query q when tracing back the original as matrix, mt denotes the position in query q matched with position j in template t when tracing back the original as matrix, and wec is the weight for the evolutionary coupling information. the new as' matrix integrating the evolutionary coupling information is recalculated as follows during the track back process.
      <dig>    

figure  <dig> illustrates an exampling of taking into account the evolutionary coupling information during the tracing back process to generate the final alignment.figure  <dig>

RESULTS
evaluation data set and metric
we evaluated hmmsato along with hhsearch  <cit>  and hhsuite on the alignments between  <dig> targets  of the 9th critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction   <cit>  and their homologous template proteins  released at the casp9’s web site. the alignment data set has  <dig>  pairs of query and template proteins.  <dig>  pairs associated with  <dig> casp <dig> targets were used as optimization data set to optimize the parameters of hmmsato, and  <dig>  pairs associated with the remaining  <dig> casp <dig> targets were used to test the methods. the reference  pairwise alignments of a query-template protein pair was generated by using tmalign  <cit>  to align the tertiary  structures of the two proteins together. the alignments generated by hmmsato and other tools were evaluated by three metrics, including sum-of-pairs  score, true column  score, and the quality of the tertiary structural models of the query proteins built from the alignments. the sp and tc scores are the two standard metrics for evaluating sequence alignment quality  <cit> . the quality of tertiary structural models indirectly assesses the quality of sequence alignments according to their effectiveness in guiding the construction of protein structural models.

the sp score is the number of correctly aligned pairs of residue in the predicted alignment divided by the total number of aligned pairs of residues in the core blocks  of the true alignment  <cit> . the tc score is the number of correctly aligned columns in the core blocks of the true alignment  <cit> . the 3d model of a query protein was produced by modeller  <cit>  based on both the pairwise alignment generated by an alignment method and the known structure of the template protein in the alignment. we used tm-score  <cit>  to align a 3d model of a query protein against its true structure to generate tm-scores and gdt-ts scores  <cit>  for the model in order to measure the quality of the alignment used to generate the model, assuming better alignments lead to better 3d models with higher tm-scores and gdt-ts scores. both tm-score and gdt-ts score are in the range  <cit>   <cit> .

optimization of weights for the solvent accessibility, torsion angles and evolutionary coupling information
we estimated the weights of the solvent accessibility, torsion angles and evolutionary residue coupling information on the training alignments step by step. firstly, we found the best weight value  for solvent accessibility. then, we identified the best weight value  for torsion angles while keeping the weight for solvent accessibility fixed. finally, we found the best parameter value  for the evolutionary residue coupling information by keeping wsa and wtors at their optimum values. hhsearch and hhsuite were both evaluated with and without secondary structure information. the default parameter values were used with hhsearch and hhsuite.

the effect of evolutionary residue coupling information on alignment accuracy
we studied the effect of the evolutionary residue coupling information on alignment accuracy in a similar way. hmmsato worked the best when wec was  <dig> . however, the evolutionary coupling information did not improve the overall alignment accuracy on the training data set, probably due to lack of a large number of diverse sequences in many cases required by the evolutionary coupling calculation to obtain the sufficient discriminative power. specifically speaking, the alignment quality increased in  <dig> alignments, stayed the same in  <dig> alignments, but decreased in  <dig> alignments. similarly, on the test data set, the alignment quality increased in  <dig> alignments, stayed the same in  <dig> alignments, but decreased in  <dig> alignments. generally speaking, the evolutionary coupling information contributed to the improvement of alignment accuracy in some cases, but its effect was rather inconsistent.

comparison of hmmsato and hhsearch with secondary structure information on the test data set
we studied the sp score differences between hmmsato and hhsearch with secondary structure for all the  <dig> testing pairs. the plot of the sp score difference  for these pairs is shown in figure  <dig>  similarly, the plot of the average sp score difference between hmmsato and hhsearch-ss for the  <dig> testing protein targets is shown in figure  <dig>  x-axis represents the index of the testing targets , and y-axis represents the score difference. specifically, the alignment quality increased for  <dig> targets, stayed the same for  <dig> targets, but decreased for  <dig> targets. we found that hmmsato often improved the alignment quality for proteins of length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> residues.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we designed a method to incorporate relative solvent accessibility, torsion angles and evolutionary residue coupling information into hmm-based pairwise profile-profile protein alignments. our experiments on the large casp <dig> alignment data set showed that utilizing solvent accessibility and torsion angles improved the accuracy of hmm-based pairwise profile-profile alignments. however, the effect of the evolutionary residue coupling information on alignments is less consistent according to our current experimental setting, even though it may still be a valuable source of information to explore in the future. particularly, we will use the latest method  of calculating evolutionary coupling information to guide the profile alignment process. furthermore, we will carry out more extensive search of optimal weights for solvent accessibility, torsion angle, secondary structure, and evolutionary coupling information to improve alignment accuracy.
