BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  in russia remains a major national health problem. however, one of the markers of an unequal social and economic development of different regions within the country is the disparity with regard to the burden of tb. the republic of karelia is located at the russian-finnish  border  and contains most of the historical karelia land. it occupies  <dig>  <dig> sq. km and has a population of  <dig>  <dig>  currently karelia has high tb incidence of  <dig> / <dig>  in  <dig>  and very high level of mortality compared to the russian north-west as a whole   <cit> . the situation is seriously aggravated by increase in prevalence of multidrug-resistant  mycobacterium tuberculosis strains: from  <dig>  % in  <dig> to  <dig>  % in  <dig> in newly-diagnosed tb group  and from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % among previously-treated patients . since the collapse of the ussr, the population mobility via finnish-karelian border has been intensified  <cit>  which may have some impact on the epidemiology of tb in finland.

the study aimed to perform a molecular analysis of m. tuberculosis isolates obtained at different time points  from karelian tb patients in order to gain insight into the phylogeographic specificity of the circulating genotypes and assess their role in spread of drug resistant tb.

methods
bacterial strains
in total, 150 m. tuberculosis isolates were analyzed. firstly, a “new” collection included  <dig> strains collected prospectively from june  <dig> to january  <dig> in different regions across karelia. of them,  <dig> were isolated from newly diagnosed tb patients and constituted all isolated from this patient category within the survey period. secondly,  <dig> strains  isolated from newly diagnosed tb patients in  <dig> made up a retrospective convenience sample .

m. tuberculosis susceptibility to the first-line  and second-line  anti-tb drugs was done using a method of absolute concentrations  <cit>  and/or bactec mgit  <dig> system according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. the bacteriology laboratory at the tuberculosis dispensary in petrozavodsk is externally quality assured by the federal system for external quality assessment in laboratory medicine of russian federation. the isolates were defined as multidrug-resistant , extremely drug resistant  and pre-xdr according to the who definitions.

ethical approval
the study was approved by ethical board of st. petersburg research institute of phthisiopulmonology. all patients gave informed written consent stating that they agree to the anonymous use of their clinical and epidemiological information and biological samples  for the study.

genotyping
m. tuberculosis dna was extracted using a recommended method  <cit> . dna was subjected to spoligotyping as described  <cit> ; spoligotyping profiles were compared to the sitvit_web database at http://www.pasteur-guadeloupe.fr:8081/sitvit_online/query.

latin-american mediterranean  family was detected by testing specific rv0129c snp; lam isolates were tested for rd <dig>  rd <dig>  rd-rio, and lam-rus markers using assays described previously . beijing b0/w <dig> cluster was identified by testing its specific rv2664-rv2665::is <dig> insertion  <cit> . miru <dig> vntr locus was specifically tested on ambiguous ural/haarlem spoligoprofiles;  <dig> copy in miru <dig> is considered a marker of the ural family  <cit> . otherwise, ural family was identified by specific spoligotype signature  <cit> .

a chi-square test was used to detect any significant difference between the two groups. yates corrected χ <dig> and p-values were calculated with 95 % confidence interval at http://www.medcalc.org/calc/odds_ratio.php online resource.

RESULTS
molecular characteristics of the new collection, 2013–2014
a total of 78 m. tuberculosis isolates obtained from  <dig> to  <dig> represented patients from different districts across russian karelia. all patients were permanent residents in karelia, of caucasian  ethnicity. of those  <dig> were homeless and the others had a registered place of residency in urban or rural settings. most of the patients were newly diagnosed ,  <dig> were retreatment cases. fifty-six were male,  <dig> were female . mean age was  <dig>  years , in male group -  <dig>  years , in female group -  <dig>  years .

to outline the population structure at m. tuberculosis family/subfamily level, the isolates were subjected to the combination of several molecular typing methods. based on spoligotyping,  <dig> isolates were subdivided into  <dig> types shared by  <dig> to  <dig> isolates and  <dig> singletons . some types were not found in the published version of the sitvit database. interestingly, the 2nd largest type  was sit <dig>  that included  <dig> isolates.table  <dig> spoligotypes and drug resistance profiles of m. tuberculosis isolates, 2013-2014

based on spoligotyping and other molecular markers,  <dig> isolates were assigned to the following families: beijing , “ill-defined” t family , ural , lam , haarlem , x , and unknown family  . of  <dig> beijing isolates,  <dig> belonged to the b0/w148-cluster previously termed as russian successful clone  <cit> . interestingly, ural sample was small enough but quite diverse even at the level of spoligotyping:  <dig> isolates presented  <dig> different profiles. lam family included  <dig> isolates of rd <dig> sublineage  and  <dig> isolate of rd174/rd-rio sublineage .table  <dig> distribution of drug resistance across m. tuberculosis families, 2013–2014

thirty-two isolates were susceptible to all tested drugs,  <dig> isolates were monoresistant  and  <dig> isolates were resistant to two and more drugs. the resistant isolates were subdivided into mdr, pre-xdr and xdr groups and stratified by genetic family . the beijing family was associated with the high rate of drug resistance:  <dig> of  <dig> beijing family strains were mdr . multidrug resistance was also found in the lam  and the ural  genotypes. in contrast, all  <dig> isolates of the t family were sensitive to all tested drugs. one should note that the beijing b0/w <dig> variant included only drug resistant isolates  while the other beijing variants  included  <dig> pre-xdr/xdr and  <dig> sensitive isolates.

within the new collection the mdr rate among all genotypes  shows an association with mdr for beijing family . data on resistance to the second-line drugs also show an association between the beijing family and pre-xdr and xdr profile: 19/ <dig> beijing family vs 3/ <dig> other genotypes’ isolates, p =  <dig> ).

molecular characteristics of the retrospective collection, 2006
the available retrospective collection of  <dig> strains isolated in  <dig> presented a convenience sample that included mostly drug resistant isolates . within this study, it was used to assess changes in the epidemiology of drug resistant subpopulation of m. tuberculosis in karelia when compared with new collection described above.

two patients were homeless while the rest had a registered place of residence. fifty-two patients were male,  <dig> were female. mean age was  <dig>  years ; in the male group -  <dig>  years , in the female group -  <dig>  years .

the isolates were subjected to the same typing methodology as described above for the new collection. the distribution of genotypes within the entire collection and across different drug resistance categories is shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the beijing family was represented by a single spoligotype sit <dig> . it was followed by more diverse lam  and t  families. most profiles received sit numbers through comparison with sitvit_web while  <dig> profiles were not found in this database.table  <dig> spoligotypes and drug resistance profiles of m. tuberculosis isolates, 2006

almost one-fourth of the beijing isolates belonged to the b0/w <dig> cluster. all lam isolates belonged to the rd <dig> sublineage and its lam-rus branch.

multi-drug resistance was identified only in the isolates that belonged to the beijing and lam families . majority of the beijing  and half of the lam family strains were mdr. in case of the lam family, mdr was not associated with any particular spoligotype. although xdr was not identified in any of those isolates,  <dig> of  <dig> beijing and  <dig> of  <dig> lam were pre-xdr.

comparison of drug resistant subpopulations from two time periods
a retrospective collection of  <dig> strains isolated in  <dig> was mainly drug resistant and we looked at the two time points separately for drug resistant  and susceptible  subgroups .

quantitative and qualitative trends observed in drug resistant subgroups, from  <dig> to  <dig>  show some increase in the prevalence of the beijing genotype from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  % . however a closer look reveals that this increase was exclusively due to the increasing rate of the b0/w <dig> clonal cluster, from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  % , although borderline non-significantly . the b0/w <dig> strains were absent in fully susceptible groups from both collections. the prevalence of other, non-b <dig> beijing strains was similar within the resistant groups:  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

a comparison of drug susceptible subgroups from the  <dig> and  <dig> collections showed that t-family isolates did not acquire additional resistance; its prevalence was similar among susceptible isolates . however this observation should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of clarity in definition of the t family as a whole.

discussion
epidemiology of tuberculosis in a given area is greatly influenced by social and economic situation, health policy as a whole and implementation of national program against tb in particular. no less it is defined by the local population structure of the circulating m. tuberculosis strains: an increasing prevalence of highly virulent clones may severely jeopardize efforts of health authorities. two collections of strains collected with 8-year gap, were used to perform a phylogeographic analysis in the context of neighboring countries and russian provinces and in the light of human migration and changing demographics, and to assess molecular epidemiology and dynamic changes of the drug resistant m. tuberculosis subpopulations in karelia.

phylogeography
past migration of human populations in this area in northern europe and historically more recent trans-border exchange shaped both human and human pathogens’ local population structures. in modern karelia the proportion of karels  decreased from  <dig>  % in  <dig> to  <dig>  % in  <dig>  this occurred through massive influx from the neighboring russian regions between 1920s and  <dig> and from more distant and diverse areas across the ussr in 1946– <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the borders and population of the soviet republic of karelia have undergone changes since 1920s through  incorporation of the ethnically russian districts, and  annexation of parts of finnish karelia by the soviet union in 1940/ <dig>  <cit> .

distribution of genetic families across historic regions within karelia is shown on the map , it was also compared to the neighboring areas   although different study design was a limitation.fig.  <dig> distribution of m. tuberculosis genotypes  in different regions of karelia circle size is roughly proportional to the sample size. ptz = petrozavodsk. free map: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:karelia_today.png

beijing and lam families are found prevalent in all karelian regions . beijing genotype is prevalent among m. tuberculosis strains circulating in karelia but its prevalence in finland remains low in spite of close trans-border contacts between finland and st. petersburg and karelia. furthermore, beijing genotype isolates in finland are likely not to be associated with russian contact but rather with an increasing immigration from asia  <cit> . we observe similar and low prevalence rates of lam family in finland and adjacent russian karelia and murmansk that is lower than in st. petersburg and pskov.

while beijing and lam present two the most prevalent families of m. tuberculosis across russia, the ural family was suggested as both endemic and low-prevalent lineage in northern eurasia  . as far as this study is concerned, the rate of the ural family appears to decrease in finland vs karelia. furthermore, within karelia the west–east increasing gradient of the ural genotype is observed with the highest rate in the southeast . notably, half of the ural family strains were isolated in a single south-easternmost pudozh district. it should be noted that even in the early 1920s ; the population of this district was almost 100 % russian  <cit> . in this regard, the ural family may justly be regarded as a “russian” strain brought to karelia through relatively long-term human influx from russia.

in contrast to the ural family, sit <dig>  the largest non-beijing type, appears to be a historical karelian strain which distribution is marked with decreasing rate both to the west  and east/north  of karelia. sit <dig> is rare elsewhere on a global scale , it is found on different continents, but mainly in europe . among northern neighbors of karelia it is found in a very low percent in finland, sweden and in the northern russian regions of murmansk and archangel to the north and east of karelia . interestingly, we found one sit <dig> isolate  in the  <dig>  mainly drug-resistant collection in karelia, olonets region  in a newly diagnosed elderly patient born in  <dig>  this is the same area, namely, southern karelia, where most of the sit <dig> isolates were detected by the current study. noteworthy, karels constitute 37 % of population in the pryazha district  and the rate of rural, less mobile population is as high as 74 %  <cit> . in view of the above, we speculate that sit <dig> may present a historical clone in the karelia area in northern europe. based on the whole genome  sequencing of one sit <dig> strain, it was assigned to the euro-american lineage and snp-barcode  <dig>  according to coll et al.  <cit>  .

finally, we feel that a minor note should be added about one particular spoligotype identified in one lam strain in the new collection. it is sit <dig> highly prevalent in belarus  <cit>  that is not a neighbor of karelia. interestingly, the proportion of belarusians increased in karelia from  <dig>  % in  <dig> to  <dig>  % in  <dig>  although many belarusians returned to their home country in the 1960s  <cit> , it could be that an isolate of the “belarusian” genotype sit <dig> may represent a heritage of that past event 50 years ago.

drug resistance
our results on drug resistance rates are in line with earlier studies carried out in different parts of the former soviet union that have demonstrated an association of the beijing genotype with mdr and a continuously increasing rate of mdr among beijing strains. in northwestern russia, the mdr rate among beijing strains from new tb cases was  <dig>  % in murmansk  <cit> ,  <dig>  % in kaliningrad  <cit> ,  <dig>  % in pskov  <cit> . in other parts of russia it was somewhat lower,  <dig>  % in ural  <cit>  and 34 % in siberia  <cit> . with further evolution of the tb epidemic in russia, the mdr phenotype is evolving to xdr, and consequently, this association is repeated for xdr  <cit> . one can hardly expect an improvement of the situation in the country in view of the  unchanged m. tuberculosis population structure with increasing prevalence of the drug resistant variants and  unchanged  tb control measures.

a closer look inside the beijing family revealed a special role of the cluster named b0/w <dig> and termed a “successful russian clone”  <cit> . the increasing active circulation of this beijing variant appears to be one of the major causes behind increasing rate of mdr-tb in karelia in the last 8 years. indeed a meta-analysis of different studies across the former soviet union demonstrated highest propensity of b0/w <dig> to acquire drug resistance even when compared to the other beijing variants  <cit> . a recent spinal tb study also highlighted a crucial capacity of the beijing b0/w <dig> strains to disseminate to other sites  <cit> .

on the other hand, drug susceptible group was and remains to be dominated by non-beijing genotypes. in this regard, an intriguing decrease of the prevalence of the lam family within the drug resistant group from  <dig>  %  in  <dig> to  <dig>  %  in  <dig>  may be noted. this result looks unusual since the lam family was demonstrated to be associated with drug resistance in other parts of russia  <cit> .

finally, the ural family has been considered a low-virulent genotype of m. tuberculosis  and is at low rate in karelia. however even for the ural genotype, similarly to the beijing genotype, we observe both quantitative and qualitative worrisome changes:  <dig> polyresistant isolate  in  <dig> versus  <dig> mdr isolates  in  <dig>  again, this observation is in line with recent alarming trends in evolution of this “less exciting” family of m. tuberculosis. while meta-analysis showed a lack of association with drug resistance of these strains in the former ussr  <cit> , very recent reports from different countries in eastern europe with apparently different national tb control programs describe an emergence of the mdr ural strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
despite decreasing incidence of tb in karelia in the last years, the situation with drug resistant tb continues to worsen. the most hazardous strains and clones  furthermore dominated by mdr and pre-xdr isolates, increasingly spread within the population. contrasting phylogeographic patterns have been revealed for the ural genotype and sit <dig> spoligotype; they may reflect a complex demographic history of karelia within the course of the 20th century.
