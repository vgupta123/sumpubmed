BACKGROUND
clic <dig> is one of the seven members in the chloride intracellular channel family of proteins that include clic <dig> , clic <dig>  clic <dig>  clic <dig>  clic5a, clic5b, and clic <dig> 
 <cit> . clic <dig>  originally named as p64h <dig>  cloned from rat tissues, was identified as a homologue of p64
 <cit> . despite its nomenclature in the chloride intracellular channel group of proteins, the role of clic <dig> as a chloride channel is still under debate. while clic <dig> behaved as a channel unable to differentiate between a cation and anion in in vitro reconstituted membranes
 <cit>  and binds to lipid membranes and transports chloride ions
 <cit> , a physiological role for clic <dig> attributable to its chloride activity is yet to be convincingly demonstrated. crystallographic analysis of clic <dig> structure revealed a two domain structure that has a fold very similar to glutathione s-transferase
 <cit> .

several cellular signals are known to induce the expression of clic <dig> including tgf-Î², lps, p <dig>  tnf-Î± as well as cellular stress such as dna damage and metabolic toxicity
 <cit> . clic <dig> is localized to cytoplasm, mitochondria, cell cortex, intracellular membranes and nucleus
 <cit>  depending on cell type studied. clic <dig> has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including angiogenesis, apoptosis, keratinocyte and adipocyte differentiation, lps-mediated innate immunity, macrophage deactivation and tgf-Î² signaling
 <cit> . changes in clic <dig> expression or subcellular localization are also associated with several pathological conditions including cancer, atopic dermatitis, ethylmalonic encephalopathy, alcoholism and autism, but the functional significance of these changes is still not well defined
 <cit> . mice lacking clic <dig> are viable and three independent groups have generated clic <dig> knockout mice and reported differing phenotypic outcomes implicating clic <dig> in endothelial tubule formation, skin and corneal wound healing and innate immunity
 <cit> .

despite major advances in the field, a coherent narrative that ties together the numerous diverse functions attributed to clic <dig> is conspicuously absent. previous studies analyzing protein and rna expression from tissue lysates have revealed that clic <dig> is expressed in various tissues including kidney, liver, lungs, brain, testis and skin
 <cit> . however the field lacks a clear in situ survey revealing cellular-level clic <dig> localization in tissue compartments as an important step for understanding its function. in part this deficiency is related to the concern that antibodies generated for clic <dig> might cross react with other closely related family members and obscure the conclusions. with this concern in mind and convinced that the clic <dig> field will benefit from a comprehensive study of clic <dig> expression during development and in various organs and tissues, we generated a knock-in mouse that expresses green fluorescent protein  under the control of the native clic <dig> promoter. in this model, both low clic <dig> expression and autofluorescence interfered with direct visualization of the gfp fluorescence. by using an antibody against gfp to overcome the potential for inadvertently recognizing another clic family member, we were able to document differential expression of clic <dig> proteins in tissue structures and cell types during fetal development and tissue homeostasis.

RESULTS
generation of clic4-gfp knock-in mice
a knock-in mouse that expresses gfp from the clic <dig> promoter was created to study the normally regulated expression of clic <dig> in mouse organs and tissues without concern for expression of other clic family members. the second exon was chosen for the fusion to avoid interfering with potential regulatory elements associated with the first exon . the clic <dig> gene codes for a protein that consists of  <dig> amino acids and gfp is introduced after the 25th amino acid. the gfp cassette contains herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase polyadenylation signal for proper termination and processing of the recombinant transcript. this introduction of gfp in the second exon results in the termination of clic <dig> transcription from this point, thereby creating a clic <dig> knockout allele. southern blotting confirmed positive es cell clones that harbor the gfp in the clic <dig> locus . blastocyst injection followed by successful germ line transmission resulted in heterozygous mice carrying the gfp in one allele. western blotting of skin lysates confirmed the expression of gfp in homozygous mice. homozygous expression of gfp also results in the loss of expression of clic <dig> transcripts and protein . heterozygous mice express clic <dig> from one allele and gfp from the other. visual examination of tails of adult mice or newborn pups under the fluorescence microscope is sufficient to identify knock-in mice .

clic <dig> expression in developing embryos
we evaluated the global expression patterns of clic <dig> during mid-to-late gestation development ) using immunohistochemical analysis for gfp on midline sagittal and parasagittal sections obtained from clic4-gfp knock-in mice.

neural tissues
temporal-regional expression of clic <dig> fluctuates in different organs, especially in the brain, where generally expression levels are high during early development and are strongly downregulated with age . at  <dig>  p.c.,  analysis in the anterior to posterior axis shows that high levels of clic <dig> are expressed throughout the entire developing dorsal pallium  that gives rise to the cortex, alar plate of the thalamus , the paraseptal subpallium, basal part of the terminal hypothalamus , commissural pretectal region  and the collicular midbrain tectum ; the ventral and dorsal layers of the spinal cord also express clic <dig>  by contrast, structures extending from the prospective prepontine hindbrain  to the medullary hindbrain  are notably devoid of clic4-driven gfp. by  <dig>  p.c.,  expression throughout the diencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain becomes undetectable, and clic <dig> expression is mostly restricted to the developing ventral pallium , dorsal pallium  and medial pallium . interestingly, in the dorsal pallium  gfp immunoreactivity is observed in the ventricular zone  and superficial  strata, but not in the intermediate stratum , suggesting that clic <dig> is expressed in the dividing neuroblast precursors in the ventricular zone and possibly during migration to the superficial layers of the isocortex. a progressive loss of gfp immunoreactivity is observed in the brain and spinal cord between  <dig>  to  <dig>  p.c.,  with the exception of very slight staining at  <dig>  p.c. in the subventricular zone , an area of limited neurogenesis in the adult brain. taken together, our results are consistent with clic <dig> expression during neurogenesis in the developing embryo and possibly in the adult.

non neural tissues
clic <dig> expression is strongly associated with development of the heart ventricles, the aorta, lung and thymus development as well as organogenesis in the abdomen, particularly intestines, pancreas, kidney and liver. there is an overall reduction clic <dig> expression as the embryo matures in the womb. the  <dig>  day old embryo has lost most of the clic <dig> expression in the spinal cord and to a great extent in chondrocyte nuclei of the vertebrae compared to the  <dig>  day embryo providing an example of the fact that there is diminution of expression in certain cell types in the developmental process. for comparison, the expression in the developing nephros is not as relatively different from e <dig>  to e <dig>  days . clic <dig> expression in developing liver and intestinal epithelium is persistent for at least  <dig>  days suggesting that clic <dig> is involved in both development and maturation of these organs. organs in the urogenital track  including bladder and genital ridge express clic <dig> at midgestation that diminishes near birth. development of the tongue and salivary glands in mid-gestation is strongly associated with clic <dig> expression that wanes as the embryo matures. the development of a stratified integument at day  <dig>  is associated with expression of clic <dig> only in the basal cell compartment and dermal cells with hair follicle buds expressing abundant clic <dig> on day  <dig>  pc but not on day  <dig> pc . an interesting association of clic <dig> expression in conjunction with the development of brown fat  starting around day  <dig>  suggests a role for clic <dig> in adipogenesis.

expression of clic <dig> transcripts in the adult brain
to determine the pattern of clic <dig> expression in the adult brain, we used the allen brain atlas  that utilizes in situ hybridization histochemistry  with labeled crna probes as a guide because gfp immunostaining of adult brain tissue was difficult to detect in specific cell types. analysis of para-sagittal sections indicates that expression of clic <dig> transcripts in the adult brain is relatively low and sparse . most of clic <dig> expression is observed in areas rich in axonal tracks in the forebrain  and cerebellum, suggesting that adult expression may be prominent in oligodendrocytes . the scattered expression in the neocortex and striatum in small cellular nuclei suggest expression in astrocytes. however, there are patterns of clic <dig> hybridization consistent with expression in neurons. in particular, there is prominent clic <dig> expression in the lateral septal nucleus  - an area rich in cholinergic neurons that is associated with reinforcement behaviors and reward. other areas consistent with adult expression of clic <dig> in neurons are the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum . in the olfactory bulb most of the hybridization is confined to the mitral cell layer and, to a lesser extent, the granular cell layer. in the cerebellum clic <dig> expression is restricted to the purkinje cell layer. interestingly, atlas data indicated that clic <dig> expression in the hippocampus is observed in the dentate gyrus, where it is localized to the subgranular zone , an area where the adult neurogenesis takes place . in contrast to other brain areas, we were able to obtain more defined immunostaining for gfp in the newly generated dentate neurons, which are small undifferentiated granule neurons devoid of extensive cell processes. as shown in figure 
3b, there is excellent overlap of clic4-gfp  with doublecortin , a widely used marker for newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus
 <cit> . another area known to generate adult-born neurons is the olfactory migratory stream, where clic <dig> expression is also prominent . taken together, the prenatal and adult analysis of clic <dig> expression in clic4-gfp mice and by ish, respectively, suggest that clic <dig> expression is associated with early stages of neurogenesis.

clic <dig> expression in adult organs
we expanded our study to analyze the expression of clic4-gfp in adult organs . probing of tissue lysates had indicated that clic <dig> is expressed in many organs and tissues
 <cit>  but subcellular patterns had not been studied. liver is one of the highest expressing organs and immunostaining confirms diffuse staining in virtually all hepatocytes and bile ductules . pulmonary clic <dig> is abundant in endothelia, particularly in alveolar septal endothelial cells. however, alveolar pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelia do not express clic <dig> . abundant clic <dig> staining is detected in pancreatic acinar cells but cells in ductules and islets of langerhans are heterogeneously labeled . clic <dig> is highly expressed in testes where expression is higher in type b spermatogonia and spermatocytes . sertoli and interstitial cells are heterogeneously labeled for clic <dig>  as suggested by the findings in mouse embryos, high levels of clic <dig> are detected in renal cortex and glomerular tuft endothelial cells with a noticeable absence in the medullary tubular epithelia . within the cortex, clic <dig> is detected in the proximal tubules and largely absent from distal tubules suggesting a function in reabsorption . a comprehensive analysis of clic <dig> expression using both homozygous and heterozygous mice was performed and the results are listed in table 
 <dig>  in summary, clic <dig> is expressed in a wide variety of cell types in major organs and in endothelial cells of many organs. of interest also is the segmental expression of clic <dig> in lateral and ventral prostate but lack of detectable expression in anterior and dorsal prostate. the absence of clic <dig> in adult skeletal muscle, urinary bladder, ureter, and tissues of the digestive system among others is notable. tissues were not available for ovary and uterus. encouraged by the interesting pattern of expression of clic <dig> in kidney, we asked if there is dysfunction in the kidney in mice where clic <dig> has been genetically deleted
 <cit> . analysis of  <dig> months old female mice  revealed a modestly reduced body weight in clic <dig> ko mice but the difference did not achieve significance. we also did not observe any difference in relative weight of the kidney between the genotypes. kidney function tests performed on serum from the same group of mice showed a trend for elevation of bun in knockout mice but this did not achieve statistical significance .

clic <dig> expression in hematopoietic tissues
we and others have noted the high expression of clic <dig> in macrophages prompting us to expand our analysis to explore the expression of clic <dig> in hematopoietic tissues. immunohistochemistry of embryonic bone marrow and adult spleen confirmed high clic <dig> expression . in the spleen, clic <dig> was most abundant in macrophages present in the marginal zone between the red and white pulp. to distinguish the cell types expressing clic <dig> in the spleen in more detail, we exploited the high sensitivity of flow cytometry to study hematopoietic subpopulations that could be distinguished directly by gfp fluorescence. analysis of clic <dig> expression in the different splenocyte subpopulations was measured by staining with specific markers. cells isolated from wt and clic4-gfp spleens were first gated using specific markers for hematopoietic cells . these positive cells from wt and clic4-gfp spleen were simultaneously compared for gfp fluorescence . high expression of clic <dig> was found in cells from myeloid origin , monocytes  and dendritic cells ), and in b cells . t cells , in general, showed lower gfp expression. further analysis of the two major t cell subpopulations showed differential expression of clic <dig> .

discussion
clic family members are highly conserved throughout both vertebrate and invertebrate evolution
 <cit>  and have been implicated in multiple cellular functions. clic proteins are amphi-morphic, existing in both soluble and membrane associated conformations at least in part determined by the redox state of the intracellular milieu. this duality of structure has made it difficult to assign a single function that encompasses all the experimental observations involving clic proteins. the most experimentally supported direct result of a clic protein action is in the formation of the gut lumen in c. elegans  and tube formation in mouse blood vessels ; while the loss of exc- <dig> in c. elegans causes expansion of the gut lumen into a large cyst, deficiency of clic <dig> in mice and vascular endothelial cells prevents normal vascular tubulogenesis
 <cit>  mice devoid of clic <dig> also have skin and cornea wound healing defects. it has been suggested that the vascular abnormalities result from a defect in acidification of vacuoles possibly dependent on ion transport functions of clic <dig> while the wound healing defects likely result from the involvement of soluble clic <dig> in tgf-Î² signaling
 <cit> . although prior tissue lysate analyses have revealed presence of clic <dig> protein or transcripts in skin, lung, liver, kidney, heart, brain, spleen, testis, an extensive immunohistochemical analysis for cellular or developmental expression has been lacking
 <cit> . we have designed a simple but convincing genetic tool to study the expression of mouse clic <dig> protein in situ in the absence of concern for cross reactivity with other closely related family members. this has provided the first look at clic <dig> expression during mammalian fetal development and a chance to probe for clic <dig> expression in a variety of adult organs, tissues and cells.

a striking example of differential expression of clic <dig> is in the brain, as determined using the clic4-gfp knock-in mice . interestingly, the original isolation of clic <dig> protein  was from rat brain
 <cit> . subsequently, clic <dig> was associated with dense core vesicles in neurons from the rat hippocampus
 <cit>  and detected as a binding partner for dynamin in rat brain lysates
 <cit> . as we show, clic <dig> is abundant in developing brain in mid-gestation but is strongly downregulated during later fetal development. clic <dig> continues to be expressed in adult brain in areas associated with adult neurogenesis , such as the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus
 <cit>  and the rostral olfactory migratory stream
 <cit> . these patterns of expression suggest a potential role of clic <dig> in regulating early stages of neurogenesis.

members of the clic gene family are important modulators of ethanol-mediated behaviors from invertebrates to mammals and, therefore, could constitute novel targets for treating alcohol abuse. a recent genetic linkage and association study in human and mice identified clic <dig> as the gene most highly associated with behavioral responses to alcohol
 <cit> . in this regard the prominent expression of clic <dig> observed in the lateral septum is important, because this brain structure is strongly responsive to acute alcohol treatment, desensitizes with subchronic alcohol exposure  and is reactivated during withdrawal
 <cit> , suggesting a potential role in the addiction process. future experiments using clic <dig> ko mice could help elucidate its potential role in alcohol addiction. clic <dig> may participate in other forms of brain pathology, as selective clic <dig> upregulation is detected in brain after experimentally induced stroke
 <cit>  and chromosomal transposition of the clic <dig> gene was detected in a patient with autism
 <cit> . together, these finding suggest that deeper analysis of clic <dig> in neuronal function and pathology will yield new insights into those processes.

while we did not probe for clic <dig> in fetal or adult eye, clic <dig> is known to be enriched in the apical microvilli of retinal pigment epithelial cells and necessary for their maintenance. targeted deletion of clic <dig> from retinal pigment epithelial cells reduces adhesion of these cells with photoreceptor outer segments
 <cit> . clic <dig> transcripts are also elevated in mouse retinas after intense light damage
 <cit> . the development of brown fat is a relatively late occurrence in fetal mice and associated with strong expression of clic <dig> protein . this is consistent with an earlier report that clic <dig> transcripts increase rapidly in 3t3l <dig> cells induced to differentiate into adipocytes in vitro
 <cit> . previous studies had also identified the presence of clic <dig> along with clic <dig> and clic <dig> in bovine spermatozoa
 <cit> . our probing in mouse testes indicates a predominant expression of clic <dig> in spermatogonia implying an early role for the protein in spermatogenesis. these revelations indicate that further analysis of the function of clic <dig> in both adipogenesis and spermatogenesis is warranted.

among the more interesting distributions of clic <dig> in adult tissues are in the kidney and hematopoietic system. human clic <dig> was first cloned from a human pancreatic cell line and derived antibody indicated strong staining in the human kidney with selectivity for the proximal tubules
 <cit> . our results confirm that localization and indicate the participation of clic <dig> in renal embryogenesis and morphogenesis. furthermore, the strong compartmentalization of clic <dig> protein in proximal tubules suggests an important role in renal function. confirming the significance of clic <dig> in renal function, it was recently shown that the ablation of clic <dig> predisposes mice to acute renal injury induced by folic acid without affecting recovery or fibrosis. in that study, clic <dig> ko mice exhibited renal dysfunction with small kidneys , proteinuria and reduced glomerular counts at baseline
 <cit> . the clic <dig> mice in our study did not have obvious renal dysfunction  suggesting that mouse genetic background or age may have a significant modifying effect on the consequences of clic <dig> loss. considering these findings, further analysis of clic <dig> function in the kidney and possible dysfunction in human kidney diseases needs to be addressed. since both clic <dig> and clic <dig> have also been detected in kidney lysates but unchanged in the absence of clic <dig>  the overlapping roles of clic family proteins in general are likely to contribute to renal homeostasis and disease
 <cit> .

recent interest in clic <dig> in innate immunity comes from the high expression detected in macrophages
 <cit> . our mouse model confirms this observation revealing high expression in the different innate immune cells in the spleen from myeloid origin. the differential clic <dig> expression between innate immune cells and lymphocytes, between b cells and t cells and between cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells expand the potential of this protein as an immune modulator. the development of spontaneous skin erosions in aging clic <dig> ko mice
 <cit>  suggests a potential function for the protein in autoimmunity. this possibility is currently being explored in our laboratory. in fact, clic <dig> expression is suppressed in effector t cells when they encounter treg cells in vitro
 <cit> .

despite the ubiquitous expression of clic <dig> in fetal development of essential organs and vital adult tissues, clic <dig> knockout mice develop normally, are fertile and present only limited phenotypes. this is most likely due to the fact that one or more clics under homeostatic conditions compensate for the loss of clic <dig> in different organs. it is also likely that there are tissues and organs where compensation is incomplete and inefficient. it is possible that deficiencies in clic <dig> function will be revealed when these cells, tissues or organs are challenged with appropriate experimental conditions. several such findings have already been reported including a function for clic <dig> in endothelial tubulogenesis, wound healing and innate immunity
 <cit> . we believe that our study will encourage investigation of the functions of clic <dig> in hitherto unexplored organs in which high levels of clic <dig> expression are observed and compartmentalized. the clic4-gfp mouse will be a valuable tool for researchers interested to study the expression of clic <dig> in less abundant cell types that are difficult to study using standard detection techniques but could be sorted by gfp based flow cytometry.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to examine unambiguous differential expression of clic <dig> in vivo using a unique genetically modified mouse model has revealed previously unknown patterns of clic <dig> expression in fetal development and adult tissues. in particular clic <dig> appears to participate in mid gestational brain differentiation, the most deterministic period of specialization, and in adult brain neurogenesis. these revelations indicate that further examination of clic <dig> function in neuronal tissue could implicate dysfunctional clic <dig> regulation in brain pathology. adult organs where novel clic <dig> patterns have been revealed also suggest further functional studies are indicated. for example, differential expression of clic <dig> in spermatogonia as opposed to developing spermatocytes suggests a role in testicular function, restricted staining in renal proximal tubules suggests a role in reabsorption, and widespread expression in pancreatic cells suggest an exocrine related function. prior studies have indicated that clic <dig> is important in acute immune responses, but we now show that clic <dig> is expressed in the lymphocytic lineage indicating a potential function in adaptive immunity. together this survey has pointed to new directions of study for further analysis of this member of a highly conserved protein family in normal physiology and disease pathogenesis.
