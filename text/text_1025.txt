BACKGROUND
notch proteins are receptors for a conserved intercellular signaling pathway that mediates a wide variety of cell-fate decisions during animal development  <cit> . notch activity needs to be regulated precisely, and aberrant notch activity is associated with a number of human diseases including cancers and congenital syndromes.

notch signaling is influenced by two conserved glycosyltransferases, o-fucosyltransferase <dig>  and fringe   <cit> . fng transfers n-acetylglucosamine  in a Î² <dig>  linkage onto o-linked fucose on egf domains  <cit> . fringe was first identified because of its role in modulating notch signaling during the development of the drosophila wing, where it both potentiates the activation of notch by one ligand, delta, and inhibits the activation of notch by another ligand, serrate  <cit> . these opposing effects of fringe on the activation of notch by its ligands, together with the restriction of normal fringe expression to dorsal wing cells, help to position a stripe of notch activation along the dorsal-ventral  compartment boundary. this stripe of notch activation is then essential for the further growth and patterning of the wing. fringe also helps to regulate notch activation in other drosophila tissues; however, there are many notch signaling events in drosophila, such as the role of notch in limiting the number of neural precursor cells  that are fringe-independent. similarly, vertebrate fringe proteins are important regulators of notch signaling in some contexts, but not in others  <cit> .

ofut <dig> catalyzes the transfer of fucose from gdp-fucose, the universal donor for fucosyltransferases, onto egf domains  <cit> . it thus generates the o-linked fucose that is the substrate for fng. genetic studies of ofut <dig> in flies, and its homolog pofut <dig> in mice, have indicated that it has a much broader role in notch signaling than fng, and indeed appears to be universally required for all notch signaling  <cit> . while this was initially taken to reflect a universal requirement for o-fucose on notch, more recently a second function for ofut <dig> was identified  <cit> . ofut <dig> is a soluble er protein  <cit>  and, at least in drosophila, acts as a notch chaperone, facilitating the folding and secretion of notch <cit> .

the fact that ofut <dig> possesses both fucosyltransferase and chaperone activity for notch raises the question of the respective contributions of these two activities to the genetic requirement for ofut <dig> in notch signaling. in this study, we have addressed this by examining the in vivo activity of notch produced in cells with ofut <dig> chaperone activity, but lacking fucosyltransferase activity. surprisingly, we find that notch expressed by these cells is a functional receptor. our observations indicate that o-fucosylation is dispensable for many notch signaling events during drosophila development.

RESULTS
o-fucosylation of notch is not required during embryonic neurogenesis
we have taken two complementary approaches to evaluate the respective contributions of the fucosyltransferase and chaperone activities of ofut <dig> to notch signaling. first, we employed a mutant isoform of ofut <dig>  ofut1r245a. this mutation alters an invariant arginine within the putative gdp binding site, and it eliminates detectable fucosyltransferase activity, while retaining chaperone activity  <cit> . a genomic rescue construct carrying the ofut1r245a mutation was created, and then introduced into flies by p element-mediated transformation. the ability of the ofut1r245a isoform to rescue notch signaling phenotypes was then assayed in animals lacking wild-type ofut <dig>  as ofut <dig> is provided maternally to embryos, this was done by making germline clones with a null allele of ofut <dig>  ofut14r <dig>  in animals containing the ofut1r245a genomic construct inserted on the same chromosome arm. in the absence of any rescue construct, animals lacking maternal and zygotic ofut <dig> exhibit a strong neurogenic phenotype, in which impairment of lateral inhibition causes excess neurons to be produced at the expense of epidermal cells  <cit> . this phenotype is characteristic of mutations in notch pathway genes and can be visualized by staining with antibodies against a marker for neuronal cells, elav . significantly, when ofut1r245a is provided to ofut14r <dig> germline clones embryos, embryonic neurogenesis, as revealed by elav staining, appears indistinguishable from that in wild-type embryos . these embryos lacking o-fuct activity can hatch, but die as first instar larvae. this result implies that the fucosyltransferase activity of ofut <dig> is not essential for notch signaling during lateral inhibition.

as an independent test of the requirement for notch fucosylation, we analyzed a mutant in which wild-type ofut <dig> is present but unable to fucosylate notch owing to the absence of its donor substrate, gdp-fucose. gdp-fucose is generated in the cytoplasm from gdp-mannose by enzymes including gdp-d-mannose dehydratase . since drosophila lack a salvage pathway for gdp-fucose synthesis  <cit> , and gdp-fucose is the common donor substrate for all fucosyltransferases, animals lacking gmd are expected to be unable to effect all types of fucosylation. animals that are mutant for a null allele of gmd, gmd <dig>  <cit> , die as larvae with no neurogenic phenotype , but the survival of gmd zygotic mutants could have been a result of maternally provided product. thus, requirements for gmd during embryonic development were evaluated by making germline clones. confirmation of the general deficit in fucosylation in these embryos was provided by staining with anti-hrp antibodies, which recognize a fucose-containing epitope on neuronal n-glycans  <cit> . anti-hrp staining was completely eliminated in animals lacking both maternal and zyogotic contributions of gmd . strikingly, however, notch signaling in these embryos, as visualized by elav staining, was indistinguishable from wild type  and gmd germline clone embryos are able to complete embryogenesis and hatch before dying as first instar larvae. these results establish that all fucose modifications are dispensable for lateral inhibition, as well as all other developmental processes essential for the hatching of a drosophila embryo.

role of notch o-fucosylation in the wing imaginal disk
notch signaling participates in many different processes throughout development and many of the factors that modulate notch signaling are context specific. for example, fng is dispensable for notch functions during embryonic neurogenesis, but plays a critical role in the developing wing. in the wing, fng is expressed by dorsal cells and its positive and negative effects on signaling by delta and ser, respectively, position a stripe of notch activation along the edge of fng expression at the d-v boundary  <cit> . the critical role of fng in positioning notch activation is evidenced by the observation that establishing novel fng expression boundaries by creating fng mutant clones in dorsal cells results in the induction of ectopic stripes of notch activation, which can be visualized by examining expression of targets of notch signaling, such as wingless   <cit> . in contrast, ofut <dig> mutant clones are associated with a complete loss of notch activation in the wing   <cit> , equivalent to that observed in notch mutant clones.

to evaluate requirements for notch o-fucosylation during wing development, we again took advantage of the ability to rescue the chaperone, but not the fucosyltransferase, activities of ofut <dig> by expression of ofut1r245a. ofut1r245a was expressed in ofut14r <dig> null mutant clones using two different methods. in one set of experiments, we expressed ofut1r245a from a genomic rescue construct, such that ofut1r245a was expressed under its own promoter. in an alternative approach, ofut1r245a was over-expressed in ofut14r <dig> mutant clones using the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker  technique  <cit> , which employs the uas-gal <dig> system to drive expression under the control of a heterologous promoter. both methods yielded similar results: when ofut1r245a expression is similar to endogenous ofut <dig> levels, the rescued clones phenocopy fng mutant clones . thus, where the clones intersected the normal d-v boundary, normal wg expression is lost, whereas the borders of clones within the dorsal compartment can be associated with ectopic wg expression. this striking phenotype has two important implications. first, because wg expression can be induced within mutant cells expressing only ofut1r245a, it indicates that, as during embryonic neurogenesis, modification of notch with o-fucose is not required for it to function as a receptor. second, it indicates that the absence of o-fucose is functionally equivalent to the absence of elongated  o-fucose in the developing wing.

we also attempted to extend these observations by examining gmd mutants. animals that are mutant for a null allele, gmd <dig>  exhibit decreased growth and loss of wg expression in the wing imaginal disks, consistent with a deficit in notch signaling  <cit> . to investigate whether this phenotype reflects a specific requirement for gmd in fng-dependent notch signaling, or a more general requirement for gmd in notch signaling, we created clones of cells homozygous for gmd <dig>  however, in most cases these did not show obvious notch-loss-of-function phenotypes . only when the minute technique was used to generate disks in which all, or almost all, of the wing was composed of mutant tissue was a loss of wg expression observed, and in all cases the loss of wg expression was non-autonomous . a non-autonomous phenotype in clones has been reported previously for a mutation in udp-glucose dehydrogenase, which is required for the synthesis of heparan sulfate  <cit> . we suggest that a general non-autonomy of mutations in genes that participate in nucleotide sugar biosynthesis could be explained if nucleotide sugars can diffuse through cells via gap junctions. owing this non-autonomy, gmd clones could not be directly compared with fng or ofut <dig> clones.

over-expression of ofut <dig> can inhibit notch signaling independently of its fucosyltransferase activity
loss of ofut <dig> impairs notch signaling, but over-expression of ofut <dig> can also impair notch signaling  <cit> . this observation led to the suggestion that high levels of notch o-fucosylation might suppress notch signaling. however, the determination that it is the chaperone activity, rather than the fucosyltransferase activity, that is universally required for notch signaling prompted us to re-examine the basis for the inhibition of notch signaling associated with ofut <dig> over-expression. towards that end, ofut1r245a was expressed at high levels in the developing notum under the control of ap-gal <dig>  expression of wild-type ofut <dig>  under ap-gal <dig> control interferes with notch-mediated lateral inhibition, and so results in the production of extra bristles   <cit> . the effect on bristles was only evident in microchaetes, but not in macrochaetes. over-expression of ofut1r245a  under ap-gal <dig> control results in a similar phenotype . this observation, together with another recent study  <cit> , indicate that the over-expression phenotype is independent of ofut1's fucosyltransferase activity. interestingly, when much stronger ofut <dig> expression  was induced in a thin stripe of cells along the anterior-posterior  compartment boundary using the ptc-gal <dig> driver with uas-ofut <dig> , wg expression was inhibited non-autonomously . as extracellular concentrations of nucleotide sugars are generally thought to be too low to support glycosylation, this non-autonomous affect is also consistent with a fucosylation-independent activity.

ofut <dig> is required for secretion of notch from the er
the observation that the fucosyltransferase activity of ofut <dig> is not required for all notch signaling events implies that the previously described notch chaperone activity of ofut <dig> is its most critical function. recently, however, our identification of this chaperone activity has been questioned and two additional activities for ofut <dig> have been proposed in its place: the first, independent of its fucosyltransferase activity, promotes endocytosis of notch from the plasma membrane to the early endosome  <cit> ; the second, dependent upon fucosyltransferase activity, promotes trafficking of notch from the plasma membrane to the sub-apical complex and adherens junctions  <cit> . the two most critical experiments distinguishing between the chaperone model and these trafficking models for ofut <dig> function relate to the localization of notch in cells lacking ofut <dig> 

first, it was claimed that in contrast to our report that notch is not secreted to the cell surface in the absence of ofut <dig>  <cit> , notch is secreted to the plasma membrane in ofut <dig> mutant cells  <cit> . this claim was based on an assay in which anti-notch antibodies were added to live disks. however, this is not an effective assay for cell surface localization, because a cell surface receptor is not required for bulk endocytosis , and once endocytosed, antibodies could be spread throughout the secretory pathway and then accumulate wherever there are significant epitope concentrations. a standard assay for cell surface localization is to determine whether the accessibility of epitopes requires membrane permeabilization. thus, we performed immunostaining using antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of notch, both in the presence and in the absence of detergent. when wing disk cells are permeabilized with detergent, wild-type cells exhibit both intracellular staining as well as apical hexagonal staining, corresponding to the normal cell surface localization of notch near the adherens junctions . ofut <dig> mutant cells show increased notch staining , which we have previously shown overlaps with er markers  <cit>  . to demonstrate that the notch accumulation near the apical surface in ofut <dig> mutant cells is not exposed on the cell surface, we stained disks without detergent treatment. under these conditions, no staining was observed in ofut <dig> mutant cells, whereas neighboring wild-type cells exhibit normal apical surface staining . these results are consistent with previous data using drosophila s <dig> cells  <cit>  and reconfirm that ofut <dig> is required for secretion of notch to the cell surface in wing disk cells.

the second critical piece of evidence presented against the chaperone model was a claim that the notch that accumulates in ofut <dig> mutant cells is not actually in the er. this claim relies on the belief that the er is homogeneous organelle, that is, that all er proteins are homogeneously distributed. both our studies  <cit>  and those of sasaki et al. <cit>  reveal overlap between notch and er markers in ofut <dig> mutant or rnai-depleted cells. at the same time, we agree that notch does not overlap perfectly with er markers in all focal planes; indeed, it is for this reason that we originally thought that notch was not in the er in the absence of ofut <dig>  <cit> . however, we now think that differences between notch and other markers reflect er heterogeneity. in support of this idea, we have investigated the relative distributions of five different er markers in wing imaginal disks cells: two dedicated er chaperones , a classic er protein marker , a synthetic er protein  and bulk er proteins . each of these er markers exhibits partial, but not perfect, overlap with other er markers   <cit> . this observation of er heterogeneity emphasizes that the lack of perfect correspondence among markers cannot be taken as compelling evidence for the absence of er localization of notch in ofut <dig> mutant cells. together with observations that the accumulated notch in ofut <dig> cells does not overlap markers for any other vesicles or organelles  <cit> , that the distribution of notch in ofut <dig> mutant cells is similar to the distribution of ofut <dig> itself  <cit> , which by several criteria is an er protein  <cit> , and that notch does partially overlap with a variety of er markers in ofut <dig> mutant or depleted cells  <cit> , these observations are consistent with the conclusion that notch accumulation within ofut <dig> mutant cells is in the er.

discussion
the observations we describe here lead to the unexpected conclusion that the fucosyltransferase activity of ofut <dig> is not essential for all notch signaling in drosophila. the lack of requirement for notch o-fucosylation is evidenced by the observation that expression of a form of ofut <dig> that provides chaperone activity, but lacks fucosyltransferase activity, is sufficient to enable notch receptor activation in at least two different contexts: during embryonic neurogenesis, where notch signaling effects lateral inhibition, and during wing disk development, where inductive notch signaling establishes specialized d-v boundary cells. indeed, because ofut1r245a-rescued animals complete embryogenesis and hatch without grossly evident abnormalities, it is likely that many other notch signaling events also do not require notch fucosylation. although reagents that would enable direct visualization of the o-fucosylation state of notch in cells expressing ofut1r245a do not exist, prior characterization of this mutant isoform indicates that it is completely defective in fucosylation  <cit> . further, the observation of fng-like phenotypes in the wing provides a genetic argument that fucosylation is lacking in cells expressing only ofut1r245a, as if o-fucose were present on notch then it should be modified by fng. moreover, in a completely independent approach, the lack of requirement for notch fucosylation was demonstrated by the observation of normal neurogenesis and completion of embryogenesis in gmd mutants, whose general deficit in fucosylation was confirmed by anti-hrp staining. the absence of o-fucosylation in gmd mutants is also consistent with the prior observation that notch signaling at the d-v boundary of the wing is lost in gmd mutants  <cit> , as this is a fng-dependent process. collectively, these results indicate that notch receptors can transduce signals without modification by o-fucose. prior results suggesting that o-fucose is required for notch-ligand binding  <cit>  can be explained by the requirement for the chaperone activity of ofut <dig>  indeed, a bacterially expressed fragment of mammalian notch <dig> can bind to delta in spite of the absence of glycosylation  <cit> .

the observation that o-fucose is not universally required for notch signaling does not mean that it has no effect. in acting as a substrate for fng, o-fucose clearly has an important modulatory role. it is, however, conceivable that this is the only absolute requirement for o-fucose, as genetic studies of the ofut1r245a allele, as well as genetic studies of gmd, are consistent with the possibility that all requirements for o-fucose might be explained by its role in fng-dependent modulation of notch: like ofut1r245a-rescued animals, or gmd maternal and zygotic mutant animals, fng mutant animals die as first instar larvae, without obvious affects on embryonic neurogenesis  <cit> . the apparently normal embryogenesis of gmd mutants is particularly striking, as fucose is a common component of insect n-glycans.

the similarity between ofut1r245a-rescued clones and fng mutant clones in the wing is also informative in terms of the nature of the requirement for fng modification. that is, the observation that loss of o-fucose results in the same phenotype as loss of o-fucose elongation implies that modulation of notch signaling by fng is affected because a specific glycan created as a consequence of fng modification  alters notch-ligand interactions, rather than because elongation of o-fucose covers up a glycan  that promotes serrate-notch interactions or impairs delta-notch interactions.

although the phenotypes of ofut1r245a and gmd might be explained simply by the requirement for fng-dependent elongation, there are nonetheless some indications that the monosaccharide form of o-fucose can have an influence on notch. in vitro binding revealed that elimination of the o-fucose modification site located in the ligand-binding region  of drosophila notch causes elevated serrate binding in the absence of fringe  <cit> . mutagenesis of the o-fucose site on egf <dig> of notch in mammalian cells also influenced notch signaling, although in this case the result was an impairment of delta-like  <dig> or jagged- <dig> activation of notch <dig> in cultured cells  <cit> , and impaired notch signaling in vivo . moreover, the introduction of a novel o-fucosylation site on egf repeat  <dig>  as observed in the nspl mutation, causes ectopic notch activation during eye development, independently of fringe activity  <cit> . these observations are, however, subject to the caveat that the affects of these mutations might not actually be a result of their effects on o-fucosylation. cell-based ligand binding assays have revealed that a soluble form of notch produced from cells over-expressing wild-type ofut <dig> results in increased binding to serrate but decreased binding to delta  <cit> , whereas notch from ofut1r245a over-expressing cells exhibits increased binding to both serrate and delta  <cit> . these differing affects of ofut <dig> versus ofut1r245a on delta-binding suggest that increased o-fucosylation can modulate notch-delta interactions. a study of a gmd-deficient mammalian cell line, lec <dig>  revealed that jagged- <dig> dependent activation of notch <dig> was reduced in the mutant cells, suggesting that o-fucose positively regulates notch <dig> activation by jagged- <dig> in this context  <cit> . finally, we note that the expression of ofut <dig> is developmentally regulated in drosophila, exhibiting a complex spatial and temporal pattern  <cit> . thus, while o-fucose is clearly not essential for all notch signaling, it might still have a modulatory role in some contexts.

our studies have focused on the fucosyltransferase and the chaperone activities of ofut <dig> as distinct functions, genetically separable by the r245a mutation. nonetheless, from an evolutionary perspective it would be surprising if these activities were unrelated. given that ofut <dig> acts during the folding process and dissociates from egf domains upon o-fucosylation, it is tempting to speculate that o-fucose might serve as a tag for correctly folded egf domains, thus directing ofut <dig> to incompletely folded egf domains. therefore, although o-fucosylation is not absolutely required for notch receptor activity, it might still affect the efficiency of the chaperone activity of ofut <dig>  in support of this hypothesis, we have observed modest decreases in notch secretion in s <dig> cells treated with double-stranded rna corresponding to gmd .

our studies also suggest the molecular basis for the previous observation that over-expression of ofut <dig> inhibits notch signaling  <cit> . we showed that over-expressed ofut <dig> inhibits notch signaling non-autonomously and non-enzymatically . although ofut <dig> is predominantly an er protein, a small fraction is secreted from cells  <cit> , which presents the possibility that the non-autonomous affect of ofut <dig> might be effected through direct interaction of secreted ofut <dig> with notch or its ligands, presumably mediated by its ability to associate with egf domains  <cit> . indeed it has recently been observed that secreted ofut <dig> can promote endocytosis of notch  <cit> , which could provide an explanation for the inhibition of notch signaling associated with ofut <dig> over-expression. we note, however, that the biological relevance of this phenomenon remains to be determined: it can occur when ofut <dig> is over-expressed, but it is not clear whether it is significant at endogenous expression levels. nonetheless, it is of potential pharmacological interest to note that ofut <dig> can act as a soluble inhibitor of notch signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings demonstrated for the first time that o-fucose modification on notch receptors is not absolutely required for their activity in fringe-independent developmental processes in drosophila, and that successful folding mediated by chaperone activity of ofut <dig> is sufficient to generate functional notch receptors.
