BACKGROUND
over  <dig> plant resistance  genes that are effective against diverse pathogens and pests, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, nematodes, and insects, have been cloned from both monocot and dicot plant species. these r genes can be divided into at least five classes based on the structure of their encoded proteins  <cit> . genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat  proteins are the most prevalent and can be divided into two major groups based on the encoded n-terminal domains and differences in the nbs domain, as well as several subgroups  <cit> . one major group predominantly encodes a coiled coil domain at the n-terminus , whereas the other group has an n-terminal domain with similarity to the cytoplasmic domain of drosophila and human toll-like receptor  domain; tir-nbs-lrr or "tnl"; e.g. l <dig>  n and rpp5). in the arabidopsis col- <dig> genome  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding genes  and an additional  <dig> related genes that do not encode lrrs have been identified  <cit> . based on phylogenetic analysis, protein motif comparisons, and intron positions, four cnl subgroups, eight tnl subgroups, and a pair of divergent "nl" proteins have been identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . these nbs-lrr-encoding genes are distributed as single genes, clusters, and superclusters in plant genomes  <cit> .

disease resistance is the predominant function so far demonstrated for plant nbs-lrr-encoding genes  <cit> . how nbs-lrr proteins function in disease resistance is still under investigation  <cit> . in addition to directly detecting pathogen ligands, r proteins may also monitor  the status of the targets of pathogen virulence effectors, or the cellular consequences of the actions of these proteins  <cit> . the lrr domains may be involved in protein-protein interactions and at least partly determine resistance specificity  <cit> . polymorphism in the tir region has also been shown to affect resistance specificity  <cit> . in addition to their role in determining the recognition specificity, the lrr domains may also participate in defense signaling through both intra- and inter-molecular interactions  <cit> . nbs regions contain several conserved motifs and are homologous to the nb-arc  domain of some eukaryotic cell death effectors such as apaf- <dig> and ced- <dig>  <cit> . the nbs domains of two nbs-lrr proteins, tomato i <dig> and mi- <dig>  have been demonstrated to be able to bind and hydrolyze atp  <cit>  and the atp binding form is the active configuration of the i <dig> protein  <cit> , suggesting that the nbs domain functions as a molecular switch in signal transduction eliciting the defense response. the role of cc-nbs and tir-nbs proteins that lack an lrr domain is unknown but they may function as adaptor proteins similar to myd <dig> in mammalian systems  <cit> .

over  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding genes that confer resistance against bacterial, oomycete, fungal, or viral pathogens have been isolated from arabidopsis . the majority of the subgroups of nbs-lrr-encoding genes contain at least one known r gene or its closest homolog in the col- <dig> genome, suggesting that the majority of nbs-lrr-encoding genes could be involved in resistance. however, some of the smaller and more divergent subgroups do not contain a known resistance gene and there is limited evidence for the involvement of nbs-lrr proteins in other aspects of plant biology, such as plant development. a t-dna insertion mutant of an arabidopsis tir-nbs-lrr-encoding gene has altered shade avoidance as well as disease susceptibility  <cit> . the adenylyl cyclase  gene cloned from maize pollen plays a role in pollen-polarized growth, for example, and has sequence similarity to nbs-lrr-encoding genes  <cit> . the tomato i- <dig> gene  is expressed at the site of lateral root formation suggesting that it may have functions in addition to pathogen recognition  <cit> . the other four protein classes that include r gene products also contain proteins that participate in other processes, such as two receptor-like kinases, clavata <dig> and brassinosteroid insensitive <dig> , that are involved in development and hormone reception, respectively, and another receptor-like protein, clavata  <dig>  which functions in plant development  <cit> . analysis of the expression patterns of nbs-lrr-encoding genes in arabidopsis may provide clues as to their functions.

although an increasing number of r genes are being cloned, little is known about the regulation of plant r gene expression. rna gel-blot analyses have detected low levels of transcripts for most cloned r genes in unchallenged plants  <cit> . however, the expression of few r genes has been investigated in detail. seven tir-nbs-lrr-encoding r genes  have been shown to encode two or more transcripts  <cit> ; however, the role of alternative splicing in disease resistance is unknown. the alternative transcripts of tobacco n gene and arabidopsis rps <dig> are known to be important for the defense responses mediated by these two r genes  <cit> . rare alternative splicing has been found for cc-nbs-lrr-encoding r genes. in common bean, the alternative transcripts were identified for cc-nbs-lrr-encoding gene ja1tr and the alternative splicing is not regulated by pathogen infection  <cit> . induction of resistance gene expression by pathogen infection has only been reported for a very small number of r genes, such as sugar beet hs1pro- <dig>  barley mla, rice xa <dig>  and xa <dig>  <cit> . the induction of a recently cloned rice xa <dig> gene, encoding a protein with no homology with other r proteins, at the site of pathogen infection is correlated with resistance  <cit> . the expression of some nbs-lrr-encoding r genes have been shown be affected by factors other than pathogen infection, such as tissue type, developmental stage, or environmental conditions  <cit> .

the methods for analysis of gene expression have advanced from single-gene approaches to a variety of global transcript profiling technologies  <cit> . large scale expressed sequence tag  sequencing  <cit>  and serial analysis of gene expression  allow quantitative evaluation of gene expression but are less informative than massively parallel signature sequencing . mpss generates millions of tags proximal to the 3' ends of transcripts in a stoichiometric manner; therefore the relative abundance of each transcript can be assessed in each sample and rare transcripts and previously unidentified genes can be detected. it is, however, costly and few samples can be analyzed. microarrays allow an intermediate number of samples to be analyzed but require a priori knowledge of the genes expressed unless tiling arrays are used  <cit> . current challenges in using microarray analysis include application of appropriate statistical approaches to identify significant changes in expression and making informative comparisons across diverse microarray datasets as well as integrating the microarray data with expression information derived from other approaches  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe multiple genomic approaches to characterize the expression of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes in arabidopsis. these approaches included representation in est libraries, mpss, microarray experiments, gene trap lines and race-pcr. the transcript structure was defined for over  <dig> genes. we determined the level, tissue specificity and possible inducibility of expression for ~ <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes. most of the nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes investigated were expressed at low levels and with variable tissue specificities. as previously observed for known r genes, expression of these genes was induced during the plant defense response in only a minority of the cases examined. this study provides the foundation for further functional analysis of individual genes.

RESULTS
representation in expressed sequence tag  libraries
we examined the frequency with which nbs-lrr-encoding transcripts were present in est collections at several times during our study. in april  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  arabidopsis sequences from the ncbi est database were searched for similarity to the spliced genomic orfs and genomic sequences of  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes. ests were detected for about half  of these  <dig> genes; most genes  had five or less representatives per gene. at these low frequencies other expressed nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes could have gone undetected in this depth of est sampling. therefore more efficient and sensitive methods were used to analyze the expression of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes. when the same analysis was repeated in july  <dig>   <dig>  arabidopsis est sequences were searched for similarity to  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes. ests were detected for only about two thirds  of the  <dig> genes analyzed. most of these  still had ten or fewer representatives per gene .

massively parallel signature sequencing  analysis
the expression of  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was then determined by utilizing the dupont mpss database for arabidopsis and the public arabidopsis mpss database . on average, there were approximately one million tags in each of the  <dig> dupont libraries  and about two and half million tags in each of the seventeen libraries generated by meyers et al. . these tags represent all the transcripts in a given sample and the frequency of each tag is correlated to the expression level of each represented gene.

alibraries  <dig> to  <dig> were made using the classic mpss protocol; all subsequent libraries were made using signature mpss  <cit> .

most of the  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes were detected in at least one library and at low levels  or transcripts per million  compared to reference genes such as ef-1α  and act- <dig>  . the most highly expressed nbs-lrr-encoding or related gene was at3g <dig> at a level of  <dig> tpm in the library made from leaves  <dig> hours after treatment with salicylic acid . the second most highly expressed gene  was at1g <dig> in the library made from callus . the gene with highest expression in untreated arabidopsis tissues was at3g <dig>  which was expressed at  <dig> tpm in a library made from leaf . other genes were expressed at much lower levels than these two genes. about half of the genes  were expressed at very low levels of less than  <dig> adjppm or tpm. expression of only  <dig> genes was not detected in any of the  <dig> mpss libraries. the genes exhibiting higher levels of expression in the mpss analysis, for example at4g <dig> and at3g <dig>  were also well represented in the est dataset. expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted or potential pseudogenes in col- <dig> genome  <cit>  was detected in at least one mpss libraries generated from tissue of col- <dig> 

the total number of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes expressed varied widely between mpss libraries from  <dig> detected in the col- <dig> leaf library , to  <dig> detected in the library made from col- <dig> late stage developing seeds . on average, each gene was present in only  <dig> of the  <dig> libraries . the four most prevalent genes, at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  which all encode cc-nbs-lrr proteins, were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> libraries studied.

most nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes exhibited different levels of expression in different tissues, at different developmental stages or in different genotypes of arabidopsis . forty nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes were expressed at a higher level in callus than in any other tissues examined in the public arabidopsis mpss database. some genes were preferentially expressed in aerial plant parts , while others were root-specific . some genes were expressed primarily in flowers . some were induced in response to a chemical or hormone  induced landsberg erecta  plants vs uninduced plants, respectively). this range of expression patterns suggests that nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes may have a variety of functions.

visual inspection revealed no obvious correlation between the encoded protein structures , cc-nbs-lrr , tir-nbs  or tir-nbs-lrr ) of the genes studied and their expression patterns. each group contained genes with different expression levels and tissue specificities. within the four cnl subgroups and the eight tnl subgroups of nbs-lrr-encoding genes identified by meyers et al.  <cit> , a wide variety of gene expression patterns were observed . consequently, no correlation was detected between gene expression pattern and position on the phylogenetic tree. there was also no obvious correlation between chromosomal location and expression pattern .

one hundred and twenty nbs-lrr-encoding or related genes , one nbs ,  <dig> tnls, five tnlx, two tntnl, two ttnl, one nl , two xtnx, and seven tns) studied were represented by more than one mpss tag . multiple tags can be detected for one gene when alternative splicing results in different stop codons and polyadenylation sites or when the polyadenylation site varies either side of a sau3a site  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes showed possible alternative polyadenylation. twelve of these genes showed possible alternative splicing because some of the tags detected were located at splice sites or within introns;  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes were of tnls rather than cnls, consistent with the multiple introns in tnl-encoding genes and a paucity of introns in cnl-encoding genes. alternative splicing was confirmed by race-pcr and subsequent sequencing for four of these genes: at1g <dig>  at4g <dig> , at4g <dig> , and at5g <dig>  the failure to detect alternative transcripts for the other eight genes may have been due to tissue specificity or low abundance of the alternatively spliced transcripts. for other genes with multiple tags detected, some were due to shifts in the polyadenylation site and some were due to the tags representing several members of a gene family.

microarray analysis
to examine expression under a different range of conditions than those from which the mpss libraries had been made, the expression of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was also analyzed using data from affymetrix microarrays that were generated as components of two larger studies  <cit> . both of these experiments utilized the whole genome array , which contained  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes which were located on the phylogenetic tree generated by meyers et al.  <cit> , including  <dig> known resistance genes  or their homologs in col- <dig> 

in one experiment, changes of expression of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes in response to application of  <dig>  mm salicylic acid  were analyzed in seven arabidopsis accessions  as part of a study to identify expression level polymorphisms as described in  <cit>  and elp website  <cit> . re-analysis of this data revealed that approximately two-thirds of the nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes were expressed above the detection threshold in the control col- <dig> sample . the expression of nine genes, at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at4g <dig>  and at5g <dig> in at least one of the three control col- <dig> samples was higher than the average of present signal in the corresponding control col- <dig> sample. based on their expression levels in the control samples, most of the  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes  exhibit significant differences in their expression levels between at least one pair of arabidopsis accessions, suggesting the natural variation in expression of nbs-lrr-encoding genes between different accessions.

the expression levels of the majority of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes were not significantly altered by the sa treatment compared to control samples harvested at the same timepoints; however, the expression of  <dig> genes , one cn , one cnx , seven tnls , at5g <dig>  at5g <dig>  and at5g46520), two tns , and one divergent nl ) was significantly induced in col- <dig> plants  <dig> hours after sa treatment . in addition, the expression of four nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes , one tn , and one cnl ) was down-regulated in col- <dig> plants  <dig> hours after sa treatment. these four genes also showed increases in their expression  <dig> hours after sa treatment though not to a statistically significant extent.

the expression of different nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was affected at different time points after sa treatment in the various arabidopsis accessions . a total of  <dig> probe sets exhibited differential expression in response to sa treatment in at least one arabidopsis accession. some nbs-lrr-encoding genes exhibited similar responses to sa treatment across different accessions though some do not. for example, the expression of one cnl-encoding gene, at1g <dig>  was down-regulated both in est  <dig> hours after sa treatment and in van- <dig>  <dig> hours after sa treatment. one cnl gene, at4g <dig>  showed elevated expression  <dig> hours after sa treatment in kin- <dig> and tsu- <dig>  one cnl gene, at5g <dig>  showed elevated expression in five arabidopsis accessions, col- <dig>  kin- <dig>  mt- <dig>  tsu- <dig>  and van- <dig>   <dig> hours after sa treatment but down-regulated expression  <dig> hours after sa treatment in van- <dig> only.

in order to compare the sa responses to changes of expression during the basal defense response, we reanalyzed the data set on the response to flagellin generated by zipfel et al.  <cit>  using the same procedures as used above. in this analysis, less than half of the nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes  were expressed above the detection threshold in at least one of the two control wild-type landsberg erecta  samples. the expression of ten nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes , at3g <dig>  at4g <dig> , at4g <dig>  and at5g04720), three tnls , and two tns ) was induced by flagellin treatment in wild-type ler. interestingly, out of these ten nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes, one gene, at1g <dig>  was also induced in col- <dig> and van- <dig>  <dig> hours after sa treatment; one gene, at5g <dig>  was also induced in col- <dig> and mt- <dig>  <dig> hours after sa treatment; two genes, at4g <dig> and at1g <dig>  were also induced in mt- <dig>  <dig> hours after sa treatment; and one gene, at3g <dig>  exhibited down-regulated expression in col- <dig>  <dig> hours after sa treatment, suggesting the interaction between plant basal defense response and sa pathway .

overall, the expression patterns of the nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes detected in the above microarray experiments were generally consistent among array experiments. most genes were detected as expressed at low levels and not induced by treatment with defense signals.

five of the mrna samples that were used to generate the arabidopsis mpss libraries described above  were also analyzed using ath <dig> arrays to cross-validate the two approaches. the expression patterns of the nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes detected in the microarray experiment were generally consistent with the mpss data . these  <dig> genes showed different expression levels in different tissues. for example, both the mpss data and affymetrix array data indicated that at4g <dig> has its highest expression in leaf, lower expression in flowers and siliques, and its lowest expression in callus and root. most genes were usually the most highly expressed in callus; expression levels in flowers and siliques were similar . forty-six of the  <dig> genes with undetectable levels of expression in the leaf sample in the microarray analysis had  <dig> mpss tags in the leaf mpss library , while  <dig> of the  <dig> genes detected by microarray analysis had more than one tag in the mpss leaf library. for  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes which are represented by unique mpss tags and probe sets on the ath <dig> array, spearman rank correlation test showed a good correlation between mpss data and affymetrix array data generated from the same leaf tissue .

reporter gene traps
we attempted to use enhancer and gene trap lines in parallel to the above global analyses, to gain information on cell-specific expression patterns for individual nbs-lrr-encoding or related genes and to investigate their inducibility in greater detail. gene traps and enhancer traps contain insertions of the β-glucuronidase  reporter gene under the control of no promoter or a minimal promoter respectively  <cit> . the expression pattern of a gene with a reporter gene inserted within it or nearby can be monitored via expression of the reporter gene. gene trap and enhancer traps also allow the analysis of the mutant phenotypes resulting from the disruption of chromosomal genes  <cit> .

the cold spring harbor database of flanking sequences for arabidopsis gene trap lines  <cit>  and the database of the ds insertion lines from singapore ima  were searched in  <dig> for insertions in nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes using blast. ten enhancer trap lines and three gene trap lines were identified with insertions into nbs-lrr-encoding or related genes. the insertion sites and orientations were confirmed for seven enhancer trap lines with insertions into five nbs-lrr-encoding genes and two tir-nbs-encoding genes . no gene trap lines were confirmed.

a nd = no detectable expression.

b called present , marginal , or absent  in microarray expression data in control leaf sample of sa experiment  <cit> .

c range of adjppm or tpm .

the expression pattern of the corresponding nbs-lrr-encoding and related gene in each confirmed enhancer trap line was analyzed using gus staining and quantitative gus assays of seedlings and five-week old plants. no gus activity was detected histochemically in whole seedling, leaves, roots, flowers and stems of any of the five nbs-lrr and one tir-nbs enhancer trap lines. this indicated that the low levels of expression detected in the microarray and mpss experiments for these genes were below the detection threshold of gus assays in these enhancer trap lines. we found no evidence that any specific cell types exhibited localized, high levels of expression as has been observed for insertions into some other types of genes  <cit> . in the enhancer trap line with an insertion into a tir-nbs-encoding gene, at1g <dig>  there was very faint blue color throughout the leaf after staining for gus activity. this low level of gus activity was confirmed using a gus quantitative assay . at1g <dig> was one of the more highly expressed genes detected in the mpss libraries and microarray data in col- <dig> leaves . these data indicate the threshold necessary for histochemical detection of gene activity in gene trap lines.

these seven nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes were not induced by either salicylic acid  or flagellin treatments in the above microarray experiments. to investigate the possibility that detectable changes in expression occurred transiently at time points not examined in the microarray experiments, jasmonic acid  or benzothiadiazole  was applied to each of the enhancer trap plants. neither gus staining nor quantitative gus assays provided evidence of induced expression of any the five nbs-lrr-encoding genes and one tir-nbs-encoding gene in response to bth or ja . the expression of at1g <dig>  on the other hand, was induced approximately two-fold five days after treatment with bth , although significant induction by sa had not been detected in the microarray analysis. to examine the possibility that changes in expression occurred in a restricted number of cells at sites of pathogen penetration, each of the seven enhancer trap plant was challenged by p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig> carrying avrrpt <dig> or avrrpm <dig>  all lines showed a similar hypersensitive response  as wild-type landsberg erecta  plants, which is the genetic background of the enhancer and gene trap lines. there was no observable localized induction of gus gene expression in the infiltrated area that reacted to the pathogen.

rapid amplification of cdna ends  analysis
the expression of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was further studied using race-pcr as a sensitive qualitative method to detect expression as well as to define the 5' and 3' ends of the transcripts. confirmation of transcript boundaries was a prerequisite to studies of gene function because approximately a third of the nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes in the public database were previously annotated incorrectly and therefore had to be corrected by manual re-annotation  <cit> . the sequences of our 5' and 3' race products were compared with the arabidopsis genomic sequence to determine the initiation and termination sites of each transcript .

a total of  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes were analyzed using total rna extracted from leaves of col- <dig> as template. at least one race product was detected for  <dig> genes . both 5' and 3' products were detected for  <dig> of these  <dig> genes. only 5' products were detected for another six genes and only 3' products for an additional seven genes. neither 5' nor 3' products were detected for the other  <dig> genes; the lack of expression of six of these  <dig> genes in leaves was confirmed using rt-pcr with primers that should have amplified an internal region of the transcript . race for six nbs-lrr-encoding genes that were not detectable in leaves from four-week old plants was also conducted using total rna extracted from seven-day old seedlings as templates. race again failed to detect expression of five of these genes, at2g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at4g <dig>  and at4g <dig>  race products were only detected for at1g <dig> in seedlings. for two nbs-lrr-encoding genes, at3g <dig> and at4g <dig>  race was also performed using the total rna extracted from flowers as templates in addition to the templates generated from leaf and young seedlings. the race results revealed that the expression of these two nbs-lrr-encoding genes showed different expression pattern in leaves, seedlings, and flowers. at4g <dig> was expressed highest in seedlings, and then the flower and leaf tissues, while at3g <dig> was expressed higher in leaves than in flowers.

for the above race-pcr products, the length of the 5' utr ranged from zero to  <dig> bp ; most 5' transcription start sites were within  <dig> bp of the atg start codon. there was some variation in the transcription initiation site and often multiple initiation sites were detected for each gene. the length of the 3' utr ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp and most 3' utrs were several hundred bp long . the most common variation in 3'utrs was due to alternative polyadenylation sites. comparison of race and genomic sequences revealed that  <dig> genes contained introns in their 5' or 3' utr regions. seven genes had one intron and one had two introns in their 5' utrs. six genes had one intron and one had three introns in their 3'utrs. the presence of introns in either 5' or 3' utrs has also been indicated in the tair database  <cit> . six out of eight genes which have introns in their 5' utr according to our race results have also been annotated as having introns in the tair database, and similarly five out of seven genes which have introns in 3' utr have also been so annotated in the tair database.

sequence analysis of the race-pcr products revealed that the annotations of  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes in the tair database were incorrect or at least inconsistent with our experimental data . these genes had been annotated with incorrect transcript initiation or termination sites, different splicing sites, or extra exons. the race-pcr products validated the previous manual re-annotations for six genes  <cit> . the errors in the other six genes had not previously been detected. these six genes had different splicing events from those predicted. race-pcr data also revealed the presence of alternative splicing in the 5'utr of at1g <dig> and 3'utr of at1g <dig>  in addition to the four genes which were indicated by mpss data as exhibiting alternative splicing and had been confirmed by race-pcr and sequencing.

discussion
our comprehensive expression analysis revealed that the majority of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes in arabidopsis were expressed at low levels and unexpectedly that many exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns . the expression of some but not the majority of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was affected by treatments with defense signaling chemicals. the expression pattern of most of the previously uncharacterized nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes resembles that of known r genes and therefore is consistent with these genes also functioning in disease resistance.

consistency between different analytical approaches
the different analytical approaches varied in their sensitivity and accuracy, but the expression data obtained from each approach were generally consistent. both mpss and microarrays were the most efficient genome-wide transcript profiling methods and they correlated well. mpss has several advantages over microarray analysis. mpss is more sensitive and accurate, since mpss provides quantitative assessment of the abundance of each transcript as opposed to the hybridization intensity generated for each probe set in the microarray analysis. mpss is particularly advantageous for genes that are expressed at low levels and therefore tend to be more affected by background noise in microarray analysis. for example, both at5g <dig> and at1g <dig> were expressed at undetectable levels in microarray analysis of leaf tissue; however, based on mpss data, at1g <dig> was expressed clearly higher than at5g <dig> in the leaf library  . mpss can also distinguish multi-gene family members better than microarrays and therefore decrease cross-hybridization problems, which is more common in microarray analysis. inconsistencies between mpss and microarray data could have been due to cross-hybridization problems in the microarray analysis or due to some mpss tags representing several gene family members that had high sequence similarity. in addition, sequencing errors in the current arabidopsis genome assembly may have caused incorrect assignment of some mpss tags and thus inaccurate determination of expression. while mpss has the above advantages, its technical accessibility and high cost limit its widespread use, although these issues may be ameliorated with the latest sequencing technologies. microarrays therefore remain a useful complement to investigate situations for which mpss data do not exist until other high throughput sequencing technologies become available that allow affordable, in depth analysis of est representation.

expression levels of nbs-lrr-encoding genes
the majority of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes examined in this study were expressed at low levels in unchallenged plants similar to what has been observed for most cloned plant r genes. significant changes in expression of most nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes including the known r genes were not detected during plant defense responses or treatments with two defense signaling molecules, sa or ja. other recent rna profiling experiments also failed to detect differential expression of r genes  <cit> . similarly, in another microarray experiment performed to study gene expression changes during the resistance response, none of the arabidopsis nbs-lrr-encoding genes showed significant expression changes during the plant defense response mediated by rps <dig>  rpm <dig>  rps <dig>  or rps <dig> . this lack of induction of gene expression during plant defense response resembles that of most known plant r genes. although it is still not clear how plant r proteins function in the plant defense response, it is clear that they act at an early step in defense signaling pathways, either as primary recognition molecules or accessory proteins  <cit> . low levels of constitutive expression of r proteins are consistent with a constitutive ability to recognize the pathogen infection and induce downstream defense responses.

there are, however, several indications of transcriptional control of r gene expression. at least a subset of r genes are induced above their low levels of constitutive expression during the elicitation of basal resistance; the expression of rps <dig>  rpm <dig>  and eight other nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was induced by the bacterial flagellin peptide, flg <dig>  <cit> . this can be thought of increasing the general sensitivity of the plant to detect potential pathogens. our analysis also revealed that fifteen nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes in wild-type col- <dig>  including the col- <dig> homolog of rpp <dig>  were induced  <dig> hours after treatment with sa; also several other genes were induced by sa in other accessions. interestingly, out of the fifteen nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes induced by sa in col- <dig>  two genes also exhibited elevated expression induced by flg <dig>  this overlap suggests interactions between plant basal defense response and sa signaling pathways. the mpss data indicated that expression of many nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was also affected by plant developmental stage or treatments with sucrose or the plant hormone aba. in addition, our gene trap studies of a limited number of r gene related sequences demonstrated the induction of the expression of one tir-nbs-encoding gene, at1g <dig>  by the sa homolog, bth. a previous transcript profiling experiment in arabidopsis also revealed the expression of several nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes was altered during defense response to cucumber mosaic virus strain y; the expression of one tir-nbs-lrr-encoding gene, at1g <dig>  and one tir-x-encoding gene, at1g <dig>  was down-regulated, and that of two other tir-x-encoding genes, at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  was induced  <cit> . these results all provide evidence for regulation of r gene expression during plant defense response and the induction of enhanced levels of defense-related surveillance in response to biotic challenge.

tissue specificity
an unexpected result from the current study was the frequent tissue-specific expression patterns exhibited by nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes. both the mpss data and the microarray data demonstrated that many nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes showed tissue specificity. some genes were mainly expressed in aerial parts of plants, while some genes were specifically expressed in roots. others appeared to be developmentally regulated. these patterns of differential expression suggest either that nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes function in resistance to a variety of pathogens that attack different parts of the plant, or that some nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes function in different plant biological processes. previous to our studies there was little data on the tissue specificity of known r genes. all of the  <dig> known nbs-lrr-encoding r genes or their col- <dig> homologs analyzed in our study exhibited tissue specific gene expression. interestingly, the tomato nbs-lrr-encoding r gene, i- <dig>  is expressed at the site of lateral root formation indicating that it might have a role in lateral root initiation in addition to disease resistance  <cit> .

alternative transcripts
alternative splicing was detected for several nbs-lrr-encoding genes. twelve nbs-lrr-encoding genes showed evidence of alternative splicing based on the locations of mpss tags and four of these genes, including the col- <dig> homologs of two known r genes, rpp <dig> and rpp <dig>  were confirmed by race-pcr and subsequent sequencing. the alternative transcripts of two genes  encode truncated proteins containing only the majority of tir domain and lacking both the nbs and lrr domains. the alternative transcript of at5g <dig> encodes a truncated protein lacking most of the lrr domain, while alternative transcripts of at4g <dig> encode tir-nbs-lrr proteins with only the last few amino acids altered. the alternative splicing in at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> which was revealed by race-pcr occurs in the 5' or 3'utr and therefore does not change the amino acid sequence; however, such alternative splicing could affect transcript stability and therefore the expression level. alternative splicing has been reported for seven known tir-nbs-lrr-encoding r genes and one cc-nbs-lrr-encoding r gene  <cit> . based on alignments of genomic sequences with full-length cdna and est sequences,  <dig> arabidopsis genes in the tigr database  <cit>  have been annotated as undergoing splicing variation and have been classified into five different types of splicing variants. although ten nbs-lrr-encoding or related genes are included in these  <dig> genes, only one gene was identified as exhibiting alternative splicing by mpss or race analysis in our studies. a recent extensive computational analysis  <cit>  identified alternative splicing events in  <dig> arabidopsis genes including  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes. seven out of these  <dig> genes were also identified in tigr database; however, only two out of these  <dig> genes were also detected as showing alternative splicing by mpss or race analysis in our studies. this inconsistency may be due to race and mpss tending to analyze sequences at the ends of transcript or due to the lack of sampling the appropriate tissues or conditions. together, these data indicate that at least  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr-encoding, one tir-nbs-encoding, one divergent nbs-lrr-encoding, and eight cc-nbs-lrr-encoding genes exhibit alternative splicing in arabidopsis.

the role of alternative splicing in plant r genes is unclear. the splice variants might interact with the full length r protein and have a regulatory role in disease resistance as has been suggested for the tobacco n and arabidopsis rps <dig> genes. this is similar to the role of alternative splicing in animal toll-like receptor   <cit> . the alternative transcript of the tobacco n gene is induced by challenge with tobacco mosaic virus and the ratio of the two transcripts appears to be critical for resistance  <cit> . the presence of both full-length and alternative transcripts of arabidopsis rps <dig> is necessary for the rps4-mediated defense response  <cit> . however, the alternative transcripts of flax l <dig> and tomato bs <dig> seem not to be important for the resistance that these genes mediate  <cit> .

one of the tir-nbs-encoding genes, at1g <dig>  may function in plant defense response as indicated by the induction of its expression by a sa analog, bth. similarly, six tir-nbs-encoding genes, at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  may also function in plant defense response since their expression was affected by sa treatment in at least one of the seven arabidopsis ecotypes studied. two tir-nbs-encoding genes, at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  may function in plant basal defense response since their expression was induced by flagellin. in the arabidopsis col- <dig> genome, there are  <dig> tir-nbs-encoding genes that have similar structures as the alternative transcripts of the tobacco n, flax l <dig> or arabidopsis rps <dig> genes  <cit> . these might function similarly to the alternatively transcribed variants of tir-nbs-lrr-encoding genes.

post-transcriptional regulation
r genes do not need to be induced at the transcriptional level in order to alter resistance against pathogens. there are likely to be multiple levels of negative regulation to prevent the inappropriate activation of r proteins in the absence of pathogen that would be deleterious to plants due to the high cost of the defense response and pathogen-independent cell death. there may also be feedback loops controlling the r gene expression and the extent of hr.

our study analyzed steady state mrna levels, which may not reflect protein abundance. further work is required to identify whether there are differences in the polysomal fraction and what post-translational modifications occur. the expression of several r genes has been reported to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. the transcript of arabidopsis rpm <dig> remains at a low level before and after pathogen attack; however, the rpm <dig> protein is degraded during hr  <cit> . the expression of xa <dig> gene transcript is independent of plant developmental stage, though the xa21-conferred resistance is developmentally regulated  <cit> .

data from animal systems have demonstrated the involvement of the 5'utr in controlling translation and tissue specific expression  <cit> . several plant r genes contain introns and/or upstream open reading frames  in their 5'utr including barley mla <dig> and arabidopsis rpp1-wsb and rpp1-wsc  <cit> . our race analysis revealed that fifteen out of the  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes analyzed contained introns in their 5' or 3' utrs. these 5'utr features may be indicative of post-transcriptional regulation of these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
transcripts of most nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes analyzed were present at low levels in unchallenged plants. many showed tissue specific expression patterns. transcript levels of the majority of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes were not altered during the plant defense response or by treatments with plant defense signaling molecules; however, the expression of several genes was altered and may be indicative of altered levels of surveillance by the plant. our data are consistent with the primary function of the majority of nbs-lrr-encoding and related genes being plant resistance; however, this does not preclude their involvement in functions other than pathogen recognition.

future studies on the significance of tissue specificity, the roles of alternative transcripts and the relationship between transcript and protein levels will likely be informative as will the characterization of the spectrum of genes induced downstream of each major clade of nbs-lrr-encoding genes.
