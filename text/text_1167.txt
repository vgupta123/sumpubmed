BACKGROUND
the variability in the genome sequence of m. tuberculosis between clinical isolates has been analysed earlier and variability in the number and site of integration of transposable element is <dig> is well documented  <cit> . there are also reports on the analysis of whole genome snps in mycobacteria  <cit> . compared to many other bacterial species, m. tuberculosis exhibits very little genomic sequence variation  <cit> . however, there is increasing evidence that even this limited inter-strain genetic variability is biologically significant  <cit> . m. tuberculosis infection in animal models has shown a range of immune responses and variable degrees of virulence depending on the infecting strain  <cit> . in the majority of humans, an effective immune response develops after infection with m. tuberculosis and restricts the spread of the pathogen and clinical manifestation of the disease is seen in less than 10% of those infected. clinical tuberculosis is influenced by variability in the host's genetic background, immune status, diet, social and environmental factors  <cit> . however, little is known about the bacterial factors, especially, genetic diversity in bacterial virulence factors contributing to variable host responses.

the expression of mce genes is of importance for the virulence of mycobacteria  <cit> . the presence of four copies of mce genes in four operons each consisting of eight genes  <cit>  and the differential expression of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons points towards functional importance of these operons  <cit> . interestingly, the domain organization in the genes of all the four operons is similar. this conservative arrangement may be of strategic significance to the biology of m. tuberculosis. the antigenic and immunogenic effects of mce proteins in nature suggest that the variation in amino acid sequence of these proteins may affect host response, apart from their effect on functions of these proteins  <cit> . in the light of these observations, we initiated the present study to understand the possible importance of genetic diversity in the mce operon genes which have a role in the pathogenesis of m. tuberculosis. polymorphism in the genes of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons in  <dig> clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis was analysed to understand and relate the effect of the genetic variability to structural changes in the proteins by computational methods.

RESULTS
single nucleotide polymorphism in mce operons
we used a discovery platform consisting of four standard reference strains  and bcg) and  <dig> clinical isolates selected at random. overlapping primers were designed to map eight genes each of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons . we identified  <dig> snps in mce <dig> operon;  <dig> of these were nonsynonymous and one was synonymous substitution .  <dig> clinical isolates were then genotyped for these snps on sequenom massarray platform. among  <dig> genes of mce <dig> operon, yrbe1a  gene was significantly more polymorphic as compared to the other seven genes, with approximately 26% of clinical isolates showing the polymorphic allele. in comparison  <dig> snps were identified in mce <dig> operon , of which  <dig> were nonsynonymous and  <dig> were synonymous snps. in mce <dig> operon significant polymorphism was observed in clinical isolates at yrbe4a  and lprn  genes with  <dig> % and  <dig> % snp respectively.

effect of snps on codon usage in mce operons
the preferential usage of codons for different amino acids in various organisms including m. tuberculosis is well known. the codon bias influences the translational efficiency in these organisms  <cit> . therefore, we analysed the codon usage in m. tuberculosis for synonymous changes observed in both mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons. analysis revealed that codons of amino acids were changed to the next preferred codon . it is possible that such altered preference for certain codons would alter the expression of the respective proteins.

the codon usage in the polymorphic regions is shown here. the synonymous changes in the nucleotide sequence, when analysed bioinformatically through gene runner software version  <dig>   predicts the usage of less preferred codon which could reflect upon the expression efficiency of the protein encoded by the gene.

prediction of functional consequences of nonsynonymous snps by polyphen and pmut servers
the functional impact of  <dig> nonsynonymous snps in proteins of mce1and mce <dig> operons was analyzed using polyphen http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/ and pmut http://mmb <dig> pcb.ub.es:8080/pmut/ servers. of the  <dig> nonsynonymous snps studied,  <dig> nonsynonymous snps were predicted to be deleterious to the organism by both polyphen and pmut programs. these nonsynonymous snps were located in the genes yrbe1b  , mce1a  , mce1b  , lprn   and mce4f  . whereas the other  <dig> nonsynonymous snps had nn output <  <dig>  and psic score <  <dig> . the highest score in this analysis was for mce1a gene with c1075t mutation resulting in substitution of proline to serine at  <dig> amino acid position. thus, c1075t was considered to be the most deleterious mutation by polyphen and pmut programs.

modeling of mutated protein structure
we selected c1075t  polymorphism in mce1a gene as shown in table  <dig> for further structural analysis. the substitution is positioned at  <dig> amino acid and we have mapped this in the three dimensional structure   <cit> . mutation at the specified position was performed by insightii/biopolymer and energy minimizations were performed by insightii/discover module for both the native structure  and mutant modeled structure . this structural analysis shows that the native  and the mutant  protein structure has an rmsd of  <dig>  Ǻ. it is interesting to observe that, in the native structure, proline <dig> is a part of the helical conformation while the mutated counterpart  has a loop structure at this position . perturbation in the hydrogen bonds as indicated in the hb plots  could be attributed to the conformational changes at ser  <dig> position and other regions of mutant protein.

correlation between drug resistance and snps
approximately  <dig> drug resistant  and  <dig> drug sensitive  clinical isolates were analysed further. four first line drugs namely isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin were taken into account to characterize the isolates. the sensitive isolates were sensitive to all the four antitubercular drugs while the resistant isolates were resistant to atleast one drug. the comparison between the two categories revealed that mce <dig> and mce <dig> operon genes were significantly more polymorphic in ds clinical isolates than dr isolates   and   respectively.

among  <dig> dr clinical isolates,  <dig> were mdr tb . among  <dig> mdr tb clinical isolates, polymorphism was observed in yrbe1a  and yrbe1b  genes of mce <dig> operon; and in yrbe4a , mce4b , lprn  and mce4f  genes of mce <dig> operon. of the  <dig> single drug resistant  clinical isolates studied, polymorphism was observed in yrbe1a  gene of mce <dig> operon and in yrbe4a , yrbe4b , mce4c , lprn  and mce4f  genes of mce <dig> operon. interestingly, mce genes were significantly more polymorphic in sdr strains than mdr tb strains in both mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons. .

discussion
it has been observed that severity of tuberculosis varies in different patients. it is possible that clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis encountering the human hosts with individual immune systems need to accordingly modulate their virulence associated biological factors to survive within the host. therefore, it is important to understand the biology of the pathogen at the genetic level. genetic polymorphisms in the bacterial hosts have been shown to significantly influence the biology of the organisms  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, most of the polymorphisms have been studied in the transposable elements and drug resistant genes  <cit> . a study of the genetic mutations in the genes coding for virulence factors interacting with host's immune system would help us in understanding the ways in which various strains of m. tuberculosis adapt to different hosts.

the sequencing and sequenom massarray analysis presented here have revealed that mce <dig> operon is significantly more polymorphic than mce <dig> operon. seven out of eight genes of mce <dig> operon were found to be polymorphic. the mce <dig> operon is expressed in the stationary phase of in vitro broth culture and in the late phase of infection  <cit>  and has role in the survival of the pathogen inside the host body  <cit> . this is the time when the bacterium has established itself efficiently in the host and it is possible that the bacterium then permits itself to undergo genetic substitutions to evade the host immune response. the detailed analysis of codon usage for synonymous changes observed in both mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons revealed that codons of amino acids were changed to the next preferred codon which would alter the expression of proteins. our observation of more codon bias in mce <dig> operon that may lead to less expression of proteins further supports the possibility that such diversity facilitates better survival of m. tuberculosis inside the host's body. our results further reveal that more than 25% of clinical isolates have snps in yrbe4a and lprn genes of mce <dig> operon. the lprn gene of mce <dig> operon codes for lipoprotein precursor  <cit> . the lipoproteins of m. tuberculosis are known to be effectively antigenic in nature  <cit> . thus, high polymorphism in lprn gene  further supports our hypothesis that such polymorphisms favour intracellular survival of the pathogen. drug resistance itself makes the organism in a better position to survive within the hostile intracellular environment. but ds isolates being drug susceptible do not have this advantage. therefore antigenic variation is a tool utilized by ds clinical isolates. for example, the function of ppe proteins is unknown. however several observations and results support that many are cell surface associated and recognized by the host immune system. the possibility of high antigenic variation associated with these highly antigenic pe and the ppe family proteins have also been reported  <cit> . the pgrs member rv <dig> is a fibronectin-binding protein of relative molecular mass  <dig>  da  <cit>  that elicits a variable antibody response, indicating either that individuals mount different immune responses or that this pgrs protein may vary between strains of m. tuberculosis. bioinformatics analysis have indicated that lprn is also a cell surface associated protein. therefore it is possible that snp observed in this gene could be translated into antigenic variation in the lprn protein to facilitate the intracellular survival of mycobacteria.

in contrast, the mce <dig> operon is required for the entry of the pathogen inside the host cell  <cit>  and hence, remains less polymorphic. however, the yrbe1a gene is revealed to be highly polymorphic in mce <dig> operon. since, yrbe1a has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein  <cit> , so the observed polymorphism in its gene may influence activity of the protein.

from the computational analysis, we could infer that the results obtained on the basis of structural details  and sequence details  were in tune with each other. both the programs have predicted that the snp observed in mce1a gene is having the highest pathological relevance. although, programs used here were primarily designed for predicting functional consequences of nonsynonymous snps in human proteins. however, concurrent observations on the nonsynonymous snps of mce operon proteins reported by both polyphen and pmut substantiate our hypothesis further. energy minimization studies on the structure of mce1a protein show that pro359ser mutation resulted in the loss of α-helical structure in the mutated protein. analysis of wild and mutated mce1a protein structures by hb plot indicates that change in hydrogen bonding interaction pattern in the mutant protein lead to conformational changes. mutation of proline to serine residue in proteins are known to cause structural alterations by the reduction of α-helix content of protein and decreases protein stability and increase its susceptibility to proteolysis by trypsin  <cit> . yazyu et al.  <cit>  observed that pro122ser mutation could bring about the alteration in the ph of the system by changing the cation specificity of melibose carrier  in e. coli. pro122ser mutant lost the ability to utilize h+ and made the carrier favorable for li+- melibose co-transport. serine being a hard lewis base interacts with hard lewis acids such as li+ instead of h+  <cit> . mce1a protein is a cell surface protein  <cit>  so it may be speculated that the aforementioned changes due to pro359ser mutation may have a diminishing effect on the stability of protein and thus on the biological function of it.

in a further analysis, we compared the snps in the genes of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons in  <dig> drug resistant  and  <dig> drug sensitive  clinical isolates. the comparison of snps in the mce genes in dr and ds clinical isolates revealed that both mce <dig> and mce <dig> operon genes of ds clinical isolates were more polymorphic than dr clinical isolates. it is possible that while drug resistance provides extra edge to dr isolates, the ds isolates try to enhance their virulence mechanisms and adaptability to hostile intracellular environment by undergoing mutations in them. this is also supported by a report by shimono et al.  <cit>  where they have demonstrated that, unlike wild type m. tuberculosis, a strain of m. tuberculosis with disrupted mce <dig> operon become hypervirulent.

further study of larger number of single and multi drug resistant isolates may give a conclusive answer to the significance of such an observation.

taken together the snp analysis and in silico modeling reported here predict that the snps in the mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons in the clinical isolates are reasonably frequent. also, the in silico modeling of nonsynonymous snp in the mce1a gene of mce <dig> operon indicates that such change may translate into altered function of the gene that may reflect on the virulence and biology of the pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have investigated the extent of polymorphism in the genes of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons of m. tuberculosis in a panel of four standard reference strains  and bcg) and  <dig> clinical isolates. our results show that snps in the coding sequences of mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons in clinical isolates can be significantly high. twenty snps were discovered in the two operons out of which  <dig> were nonsynonymous changes. further analysis of pathological relevance of these changes revealed that five of the snps were deleterious. overall, mce <dig> operon is significantly more polymorphic than mce <dig> operon . however, nonsynonymous snps detected in mce1a gene of mce <dig> operon predict effect of such snps on the biology of the pathogen.
