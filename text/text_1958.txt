BACKGROUND
proteolysis is a poorly understood aspect of plant molecular biology. although proteases play crucial roles in many important processes in plant cells, e.g. responses to changes in environmental conditions, senescence and cell death, very little information is available on the substrate specificity and physiological roles of the various plant proteases. even for the most abundant plant protein, ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase , neither the proteases involved in its degradation nor the cellular location of the process are known. in the arabidopsis thaliana  genome, many genes with sequence similarities to known proteases have been identified; the merops database  of arabidopsis proteases contains  <dig> entries, corresponding to almost  <dig> % of the proteome. however, protease activity has only been demonstrated for a few of the entries. most of these putative proteases are found in extended gene families and are likely to have overlapping functions, complicating attempts to dissect the roles of the different proteases in plant metabolism and development.

one scenario in which proteases play a very important role is senescence, although it still is discussed if they actually cause senescence or purely are involved in resource mobilization.

senescence is the final stage of plant development and can be induced by a number of both external and internal factors such as age, prolonged darkness, plant hormones, biotic or abiotic stress and seasonal responses. an important function of senescence is to reallocate nutrients, nitrogen in particular, to other parts of the plant before the specific structure is degraded. the understanding of senescence is very important for biomass production. in order to understand more about the role of proteases during senescence in this study we compare the nuclear genome of arabidopsis thaliana and populus trichocarpa. the close relationship of these two species in the plant kingdom  <cit>  allows a direct comparison of an annual plant with a tree that has to cope with highly variable adaptations during its long life span. recent research has shown that leaf senescence affects the chloroplast much earlier than the mitochondria or other compartments of the cell  <cit> , we therefore chose to focus on protease families that express members in this plastid as well as on the papain protease family which consists of proteases that are well-known to be involved in senescence.

in the chloroplast at least  <dig> different protease families are represented, however, several of them work as processing peptidases. only  <dig> families posses members that are known to be involved in degradation, four of these families belong to the class of serine proteases, two are metalloproteases. the deg proteases form one family  inside the serine clade and the atp-dependent clp proteases are grouped in the s <dig> family. the s <dig> family contains the so-called lon proteases. metalloproteases  are proteases with a divalent cation cofactor that binds to the active site; most commonly zn2+ is ligated to two histidines in the sequence hexxh. however, zn2+ can be replaced by co2+, mn2+ or even mg2+. the m <dig> family is the group of ftsh proteases and the egy  proteases belong to the family of s2p proteases .

comparative genomics analyses could provide valuable insights into the conservation, evolution, abundance and roles of the various plant protease families. for instance, such analyses should facilitate the detection of protein sequences that are conserved in different species, and thus are likely to have common functions in them, and recent expansions of gene families, which should help elucidate issues concerning non-functionalization, neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization. thus, as reported here, we undertook a comparative analysis of protease gene families in the two sequenced dicot genomes, those of the annual plant arabidopsis and the tree populus trichocarpa , with special emphasis on proteases which may play a role in senescence. the results should help to provide a framework for further elucidation of the nature and roles of these complex gene families.

RESULTS
most protease gene families are larger in populus than in arabidopsis
we made an analysis of all protease genes of arabidopsis and populus. as noted above, conservation of a protein sequence in these two species indicates that it is likely to have a common function in them. recent expansions of gene families, on the other hand, could provide indications of different adaptive requirements .

the results of the genome comparison between arabidopsis and populus are compiled in table  <dig>  in total, we identified  <dig> genes coding for putative proteases in arabidopsis and  <dig> in populus. forty-five previously unidentified arabidopsis genes were detected that were not present in the merops database at the time. like most of the genes in the merops database, we do not know whether or not these genes code for active proteases, but due to their sequence similarity they could have protease activity and were included in the comparison. figure  <dig> shows a graphic representation of this comparison. generally the protease gene numbers in each family do not vary greatly between the two species, although populus has more members in most subfamilies, a consequence of its genome history. both lineages have undergone rather recent genome duplications  <cit>  but the evolutionary clock seems to tick almost six-fold slower in the populus as compared to the arabidopsis lineage and loss of duplicated genes have been much retarded  <cit> . however, some families were more expanded than others, especially the a <dig> subfamily of aspartic proteases , which has  <dig> members in arabidopsis and  <dig> members in populus. since the characteristic sequence of these proteases is part of the copia-transposable element, which is abundant in populus  <cit> , this expansion is likely to have been simply a consequence of the multiplication of the transposon, rather than selection pressure to increase the copy number of the protease per se. therefore, this family will not be mentioned further. some subfamilies  have twice as many members in populus compared to arabidopsis, but in arabidopsis these numbers are low, thus duplication could have readily occurred. an interesting case is the subfamily c <dig>  the ulp <dig>  endopeptidase family, cystein-type, which contains sumo  deconjugating enzymes, with  <dig> members in arabidopsis, but only  <dig> in populus. this protein family has been shown to cleave not only the sumo precursor, but also sumo ligated to its target proteins; sumo-ligation probably being involved in many cellular processes, including nuclear export and stress responses  <cit>  and flowering  <cit> . this family appears to have greatly expanded in arabidopsis recently.

to confirm the findings described above, case studies were performed in more detail, focusing on proteases that are known to be present in the plant plastids and mitochondria, partly because we have a special interest in organellar biology and partly because these proteases generally belong to the best characterized plant protease families. the "organellar protease subfamilies" chosen for detailed comparisons were: the deg/htra family , lon protease family , rhomboid protease family  and the clp endopeptidase family , all belonging to the serine-type class, and the metallo-type ftsh endopeptidase family . in addition, we examined the papain-like cysteine protease family  as certain members are known to play an important role in leaf development, being the necessary machinery that the leaf needs to respond to different kind of stresses or to undergo senescence.

the ftsh protease family
ftshs are atp-dependent proteases that based on the x-ray crystallographic analysis form a homo-oligomeric hexameric ring  <cit> . e. coli ftsh has two transmembrane domains towards the n-terminus that anchor it in the plasma membrane, while the protease domain and the c-terminus face the cytoplasm  <cit> . four isomers of ftsh have been identified in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>   <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . of the nine ftsh that reside in the chloroplast, five have been shown to be involved in the degradation of photosynthetic proteins during light acclimation  <cit>  or after high light damage  <cit> .

in arabidopsis the ftsh family is encoded by  <dig> homologous sequences  <cit> . four of these sequences lack the zn-binding motif and are therefore thought to have lost proteolytic activity. however, they might be involved in chaperone functions instead  <cit> . in this work we focused on these presumably active proteases. ftsh proteases are thought to be membrane integral, as has been shown experimentally for ftsh <dig>  this protease is inserted into the thylakoid membrane with the zn-binding and atpase motifs facing the stroma  <cit> . gene comparison studies showed that of the  <dig> ftsh genes potentially coding for fully functional proteases  <dig> are found in highly homologous pairs. while the pairs atftsh1/ <dig>  atftsh2/ <dig> and atftsh 7/ <dig> are targeted to the chloroplast, atftsh3/ <dig> and atftsh <dig> have been identified in mitochondria  <cit> . atftsh <dig>  which contains only one transmembrane domain was recently suggested to be located in both chloroplasts and mitochondria  <cit> . atftsh <dig> and atftsh <dig>  both localized in the chloroplast  <cit>  have no pair-partners. the proteins in a pair very likely work in concert, and have overlapping functions as shown for ftsh1/ <dig> and ftsh2/ <dig>  <cit> . these pairs of proteases are the most strongly expressed ftshs in plants. deletion mutants of these genes lead to a variegated leaf type, therefore the names var <dig> and var <dig> were given to them . the only ftsh protein for which a function has been established, apart from these four proteases, is ftsh <dig>  <cit> .

the var <dig> group, represented by atftsh <dig> and atftsh <dig> in arabidopsis, has the most populus representatives ; all of which are very closely related and appear to have originated from a recent gene family expansion. the var <dig> group comprises atftsh <dig>  atftsh <dig>  ptftsh <dig>  and ptftsh <dig> . a more distant relative of this group is ptftsh <dig> , which has no close arabidopsis homologue. atftsh <dig> and its populus ortholog, ptftsh <dig>  are closely related to the var1/var <dig> groups, and clearly separated from the ftsh4/ <dig>  ftsh3/ <dig>  ftsh7/ <dig> and ftsh <dig> groups. interestingly, while in the pairs ftsh <dig> and  <dig>  ftsh <dig> and  <dig>  ftsh <dig> and  <dig> and ftsh <dig> and  <dig> the duplication of the genes seem to have occurred after the separation of populus and arabidopsis, in the pair ftsh <dig> and ftsh <dig> the arabidopsis proteases have at least one distinct orthologue in populus. here subfunctionalization seems to have occurred, evident by the fact that atftsh <dig> is found in mitochondria, while atftsh <dig> also can be located in the chloroplast  <cit> .

some deg subfamilies are more expanded in arabidopsis
the deg proteases form the first family  inside the serine clade. degp  was the first deg protease identified in e. coli  <cit> . as determined from its crystal structure it functions as homotrimeric oligomer  <cit> , the catalytic center consisting of the residues his-asp-ser typical for most serine proteases . htra also functions as a chaperone at low temperature  <cit> . while cyanobacteria – like e. coli – posses  <dig> members of this family, in the arabidopsis genome  <dig> homologues were found. deg <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been identified in the chloroplast  <cit> . in plants and cyanobacteria the deg proteases are thought to be involved in cell growth, stress responses, pcd and senescence  <cit> .

the deg protease family in arabidopsis consists of  <dig> proteins that are localized in different cellular compartments and in many cases have unknown functions. atdeg <dig>  atdeg <dig>  atdeg <dig> and atdeg <dig> are the plastidic members of the atdeg group. atdeg <dig>  atdeg <dig> and atdeg <dig> have been localized in the thylakoid lumen of the plant chloroplast  <cit> . atdeg <dig> has been identified at the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane and seems, at least in higher plants, to be responsible for the degradation of the reaction center d <dig> protein of photosystem ii   <cit> .

the deg <dig> group consists exclusively of populus sequences. these genes code for three proteases that are not closely related to any arabidopsis protein, but clearly belong to the chymotrypsin family and have a deg structure, perhaps representing a subfamily that was lost during arabidopsis evolution .

the clp family
clp proteases are multi-subunit enzymes in which the catalytic domain and the atpase domain are split in different subunits. structurally they are very similar to the proteasome 26s in eukaryotes  <cit> ; suggesting that these atp-dependent proteases are evolutionary related. proteins in the plant clp family, consisting of chaperones and proteases involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins  <cit> , have been grouped in two different subclasses  <cit> . the proteolytically active protease is designated clpp, but there are also many genes coding for similar proteins lacking the ser and his amino acid residues of the catalytic triad, and thus representing an inactive form, named clpr, with unknown function. the regulating subunits work as chaperones that unfold the targeted proteins for degradation, but may also be involved in protein folding independent of proteolysis. class i chaperones contain two atp-binding sites like the clpcs and clpbs, while the class ii chaperones contain only one atp binding site, like clpd, clpf and clpxs  <cit> . crystallisation studies  <cit>  have shown that the protease unit, clpp, forms a tetradecameric barrel-like structure. on one or both ends complexes of atpase subunits, in e. coli either clpa or clpx, form homo-hexameric rings. in the absence of clpp these units can act as chaperones. in chloroplasts, homologues of clpb and clpc, but not clpa form a complex with clpp  <cit> . chloroplast genomes of alga and higher plants contain a gene potentially encoding clpp and only recently clpp was also discovered in the nuclear genome  <cit> .

we analyzed the homology between clp proteases in arabidopsis and populus . in the maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree , not surprisingly, a clear separation between the catalytic subunits  and the regulatory ones can be seen. in the clpp/clpr clade, the inactive forms clpr <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> are more closely related to each other than to the clpp proteins and the clpr <dig>  arabidopsis clpr <dig> has three populus homologs, clpr <dig> has two and clpr <dig> one apparent ortholog.

the clpr <dig> sequences from arabidopis and populus are most similar to the clpp <dig> proteins, probably representing a successful case of horizontal gene transfer from the chloroplast to the nucleus that happened before the split of the lineages leading to arabidopsis and populus. atclpp <dig> is encoded in the chloroplast. we found five homologous sequences in the populus nuclear genome, illustrating the flux of genetic material from the chloroplast to the nuclear genome. however, we did not find signs of expression  for any of these putative genes, and some of them also appeared not to code for full-length proteins, suggesting that they represent non-functional dna inserted into the nuclear genome, therefore they will not be further considered here. atclpp <dig> has four populus homologs, most of the remaining catalytic atclp proteins have two or more orthologs in populus, but clpp <dig>  clpr <dig> and clpr <dig> each have only one.

the lower part of the mpt in fig.  <dig> shows the relationships of the regulatory subunits. ten well-supported subgroups can be identified: the clpc <dig>  clps, clpd, clpc1/c <dig>  clpf, clpt, clpx groups, two clpb groups, and the clpn <dig> group, containing one arabidopsis and three populus genes. the separation of the clpb1- <dig>  clpc, clpd and clpf branches is well supported, with clpc and clpf being more closely related to each other than to the other members. the main difference between the clpd and clpc groups is that they have specific signature sequences, but they have also been shown to have different expression profiles, clpds being specifically expressed in dehydration and senescence  <cit> . the presence of two different clpb groups is an interesting feature, which can be explained by the fact that at1g <dig>  is grouped by tair as a clpb-related protein. as the nomenclature for clpb1- <dig> has already been established, we decided to name this arabidopsis/populus class clpb <dig> 

atclpt is a homolog to the bacterial clps, a subunit that in e. coli might regulate the activity of the whole clp complex  <cit> . in populus we find  <dig> homologs.

similar to the situation in the other protease families, many arabidopsis clp genes have two close homologs in populus, but the clpd and clpb <dig> families are more heavily extended in populus, both having five populus genes compared to a single arabidopsis gene. there are two clpc members in each organism. however, both of the populus clpcs seem to be more closely related to atclpc <dig> than to atclpc <dig>  the clpx group is predicted to be localized in the mitochondrial matrix in arabidopsis  <cit>  and it is formed by three proteases in each organism. atclpx <dig> seems to have a clear ortholog in populus, while the other two populus cl/px proteases are more closely related to atclpx <dig> 

lon proteases
lon proteases  are responsible for the degradation of abnormal, damaged and unstable proteins. they have no membrane-spanning domain and contain the aaa  and protease domains in one polypeptide. instead of the ser-his-asp of "classical" serine proteases, in lon proteases the catalytic site is suggested to be formed by a ser-lys dyad  <cit> . a crystal structure of lon in e. coli was determined recently and shown to form a hexameric ring  <cit> . lon proteases have been described as mitochondrial proteases. however, recent studies have predicted their presence in chloroplasts and peroxisomes  <cit>  and lon <dig> was shown to be targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria  <cit> .

rhomboid proteases
the rhomboid family  is a relatively poorly investigated family. it has been widely detected in bacteria, archaea and, recently, eukaryotic organisms – initially in drosophila melangolaster  <cit> , then plants  <cit> . rhomboid proteases are membrane proteins with six or seven transmembrane domains that cleave their substrates within the substrate's transmembrane domain. this so-called regulated intramembrane proteolysis  has been shown to be very important for signal transduction. in recent studies of arabidopsis rhomboids a catalytic dyad has been suggested to be the active site, formed by ser-his residues  <cit> . the overall structure and sequence of the rhomboid proteases, widely conserved throughout all kingdoms, is very different from that of the other serine proteases, suggesting that they have become serine proteases by convergent evolution  <cit> . today,  <dig> members are annotated in arabidopsis. another arabidopsis gene  has high sequence homology to this family, but it is predicted to code for a protein with only two membrane-spanning helices and therefore was not considered in this study. two rhomboids  have been shown to be localized in the golgi apparatus  <cit> , the subcellular localization of most of the others is predicted to be in mitochondria. only atrbl <dig> and  <dig> were predicted to be located in the chloroplast using the programs targetp and predator. however, the meta analysis of the arabidopsis rhomboid genes in genevestigator  <cit>  suggests that some of them may play important roles in leaf development and senescence.

the egy proteases belong to the family of s2p proteases , which are atp-independent metallo-proteases. egy <dig> has been recently characterized  <cit>  as a required protease for chloroplast development. with  <dig> putative transmembrane domains and the intramembrane zn2+-binding domain, these proteases might have a similar structure and function as the rhomboids  <cit> , even though they belong to the class of metalloproteases. the arabidopsis genome possesses  <dig> egys, egy <dig>  having been identified in the chloroplast, has one possible orthologue in populus, egy <dig> shows homology to one closer and one more distant relative in populus. egy <dig> possesses less homology to the other two arabidopsis proteases and also has one orthologue in populus .

cysteine proteases
in animals, the most representative family of this group is the group of caspases , which play an important role in programmed cell death  and hypersensitive response  controlling the so-called apoptosis cascade. closely related proteases in plants are the metacaspases , which have been found to be involved in hr and to act through a caspase-like mechanism  <cit> .

the most abundant and thoroughly studied cp family is the papain-like  protease family, which has been related leaf senescence  <cit> . sag <dig> , the senescence-specific protease  <cit> , is the only protease to be expressed solely during leaf senescence  <cit>  in arabidopsis and brassica napus  <cit> . this large family of cysteine proteases also plays diverse roles in defense against pathogens  <cit> . thirty-eight papain-like cysteine proteases were identified in arabidopsis and  <dig> in populus . the xylem-related cysteine proteases are separated into two different branches, one consisting of the xcps  with two arabidopsis genes and three populus genes, and the other consisting of the xbcp  from arabidopsis with four homologs in populus. the two clades of senescence-related cysteine proteases, including the well-known sag <dig> genes, consist of many more genes in populus than in arabidopsis . seven populus proteases have higher homology to the arabidopsis sag <dig> than to any other arabidopsis proteases, making it difficult to predict if any of these proteases is a functional homolog in populus that plays an essential role during leaf senescence. the second clade consists of  <dig> populus proteases without any arabidopsis homologue, indicating the necessity of these proteases in a tree versus an annual plant. however, the rd <dig> proteases , that also are known to be involved in senescence, form a separate group, which has more members in arabidopsis than in populus . also the group containing homologs to spcp <dig>  includes seven arabidopsis genes, but lacks populus representatives.

different populus tissues express unique repertoires of proteases
the extensive populus est resource compiled in populusdb  <cit>  allows indications of the expression patterns of populus genes to be rapidly obtained. of the  <dig> genes classified above as putative proteases  <dig> had associated ests in populusdb, suggesting that these genes, at least, are expressed. since there are correlations, albeit imperfect, between the abundance of ests and the levels of corresponding mrnas and proteins in particular tissues we wanted to identify the tissues/treatments in which the mrnas of different types of proteases are most strongly represented. to see if other proteases show similar specificity we examined their digital expression profiles, applying two criteria to reduce the numbers of false positives due to limited information  . these criteria were  more than four ests had to be associated with the candidate gene and  more than twice as many ests had to be detected in one library than in any other. only nineteen genes fulfilled these criteria for specific expression. interestingly, members of the deg-, ftsh- and papain-like proteases were all highly expressed in senescing leaf tissue. in addition to proteases with particularly high est frequencies in the senescing leaf and wood cell death libraries, we identified proteases that appeared to be highly expressed in flower buds , male catkins , the cambial zone  and the shoot apical meristem, tension wood, roots and dormant cambium . tissue-specific expression may be the result of a subfunctionalization process, stabilizing both copies of a duplicated gene. to assess the likelihood that such a process has occurred in populus, we sought evidence indicating that unusually high numbers of these genes have undergone recent duplications. we found that the overwhelming majority of the gene families appear to have expanded recently, from one copy in arabidopsis to two or three copies in populus. this is consistent with the hypothesis that subfunctionalization is one of the forces that has maintained the high proportion of duplicated genes in populus.

we also constructed a clustered correlation map  <cit>  for all protease genes for which we had est data. this map  showed that the different tissues/treatments were associated with quite specific protease expression patterns. three main clusters could be identified. the senescing leaf library seemed to express a specific set of proteases similar to the wood cell death and the cold-stress leaves libraries, quite distinct from those found in other libraries. but there were also distinct similarities in the patterns of several other libraries, especially the shoot apical meristem, cambial zone, tension wood, flower bud and female flower libraries. although libraries from similar source material sometimes clustered together , there were also remarkable differences in the repertoire of proteases expressed in similar tissues in some cases, e.g. between active and dormant cambium, and between male and female catkins, which clustered far away from each other. taken together, this shows that different populus tissues express unique suites of proteases. most strongly expressed were  <dig> proteases in the senescing leave library . the three most strongly transcribed proteases belonged to the papain-like family , followed by proteases with highest similarity to arabidopsis clpc, degp, ftsh <dig> and ftsh <dig>  the same proteases also had very specific expression in their tissues .

patterns of protease gene expression during populus leaf development
since we have a particular interest in leaf proteases, we examined the expression of these proteases during populus leaf development in more detail. over a developmental gradient, it is easy to imagine a number of plausible expression patterns. the simplest may be that some proteases, with functions during leaf expansion, may be expressed in young leaves and their expression levels may gradually decrease, whereas opposite patterns would be expected for others, involved in leaf senescence. yet others may have different, more complex, patterns. for this analysis, we used two dna microarray datasets from a mature aspen  grown in the field in umeå, sweden  <cit>  . mature aspens are particularly useful since they only have one flush in the spring, so every leaf at a given date is of the same age, facilitating transcript profiling over a developmental gradient. bud burst occurs at the end of may and june, and progresses through several phases, during which cell elongation and primary cell wall formation occur, then secondary cell formation peaks. during july and august, no strong trends in gene expression occur and in september, leaf senescence starts  <cit> . we extracted expression profiles for all microarray elements, showing reasonable expression levels some time during leaf development, and performed a hierarchical clustering on the expression profiles . as expected, many different patterns were found, but based on the clustering results twelve major patterns were detected. all but three array elements coding for a putative protease exhibited one of these twelve common expression patterns. the expression profiles shown in figure  <dig> are representations of these twelve patterns. the two array datasets do not have a common reference, therefore the two expression profiles are separated by a gap in the line. the sampling dates for the first experiment were august  <dig>  august  <dig>  september  <dig>  september  <dig>  september  <dig>  september  <dig> and september  <dig>   <dig> and the sampling dates for the second series were may  <dig>  june  <dig>  june  <dig>  june  <dig>  june  <dig>  june  <dig>  july  <dig>  july  <dig>  july  <dig>  august  <dig>  august  <dig>  august  <dig>  august  <dig> and september  <dig>   <dig>  despite these limitations, these data can be used to classify the expression patterns of the leaf proteases.

the genes in cluster  <dig> are the truly senescence-associated genes. their mrna levels did not notably increase until september, but their expression then continued to increase in successive samples, including the last sample from which rna could be prepared, collected on september  <dig>  this expression pattern was exhibited by genes encoding protease classes c <dig> , c <dig>  c <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and t <dig> , i.e. a number of the classes with previously indicated roles during leaf senescence . cluster  <dig> had a similar pattern, but the changes were less pronounced, so these genes were only moderately induced during leaf senescence. this cluster contained genes from classes c <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  cluster  <dig> consisted of genes that had a fairly stable expression throughout the growing season, but with low mrna levels during both bud burst and leaf senescence. pattern  <dig> was only represented by a s <dig>  protease gene, which had a pronounced peak during the cell wall biosynthesis phase in the leaf and decreased to low levels in older leaves. cluster  <dig> genes were mainly expressed during the first two weeks of leaf development  whereas cluster  <dig> genes showed the opposite pattern, i.e. they were much more strongly expressed after, rather than during the first two weeks. cluster  <dig> was a major cluster, including four genes in the c <dig> class, seven in the s <dig>  class, two in the m <dig> class, and four other classes. almost half of the genes coding for proteins in the clp family appeared to be specifically down regulated when the leaf expanded, suggesting that they have no important function in this stage of leaf development. clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all contain proteases of many different classes, and all showed essentially constitutive expression patterns, except that cluster  <dig> had lower mrna levels in the middle of the summer. clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  containing mainly serine proteases, both showed high mrna levels in the first week of leaf development, but cluster  <dig> seemed to be induced later in the season. almost all proteasome subunits exhibited expression pattern  <dig>  indicating that the proteasome is most important at the very first stages of aspen leaf development from winter buds. finally, cluster  <dig> showed high expression levels only in very young leaves and during late stages of senescence. taken together, these data indicate that there are several "waves" of protease gene expression during leaf development; consistent with the idea that proteases are important during all stages of the lifecycle of the leaf.

discussion
we here present a comparative analysis of the gene families coding for putative proteases of arabidopsis and populus. the patterns for the copy numbers of most families and subfamilies were quite consistent – the populus families were generally larger, as an apparent result of the fairly recent genome duplication  <cit> . some families were considerably more heavily represented in populus, but a few were more abundant in arabidopsis. it seems reasonable to expect, for example, a tree like populus to show relatively strong retention of families like rd <dig> and sag <dig>  which are involved in the response to dehydration and leaf senescence, respectively – traits that would intuitively require more elaborate regulation in a tree than in an annual plant, but surprisingly the rd <dig> family was one of the few gene families that was larger in arabidopsis than in populus. this supports the view that a considerable element of chance has influenced the size of the gene families in populus, and that stochastic events as well as subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization are important determinants of whether genes are lost or retained in a duplicated genome. therefore, in most cases, the presence of higher numbers of genes in one plant species than in another cannot be explained simply by their adaptive "needs". however, subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization should not be neglected – in fact, we have shown that they have affected the evolution of the populus genome  <cit> , and our analysis of genes with tissue-specific expression patterns supports this notion.

unfortunately, of the  <dig> and  <dig> proteases identified in arabidopsis and populus, respectively, the function, localization and substrate of most of the proteases remain enigmatic. the var1/var2/ftsh <dig> proteases comprise one of the few protease groups for which mutant phenotypes in arabidopsis have been carefully examined, and placed in a phylogenetic perspective  <cit> . their function in photoprotection seems to have evolved at a very early stage, in the cyanobacterial progenitors of modern cyanobacteria, algae and plants  <cit> . later, the var <dig> and var <dig> functions appear to have separated, and there seems to be an overlap in the substrate specificity of the proteases and the phenotypes of the mutants. var <dig> and var <dig> are more sensitive than wild type to psii photoinhibition  <cit> . this duplication of the genes appears to have happened after the separation of arabidopsis and populus . however, in the lineage leading to higher plants, within this group the ftsh <dig> evolved through neo-functionalization; this protease degrades the antenna rather than reaction center proteins. a clear ortholog of atftsh <dig> can also be found in populus. based on this very limited information we raise the following hypothesis. if there is a one-to-one relationship between the populus and arabidopsis sequences, we assume that these genes are functional orthologs, i.e. they degrade the same substrate under the same conditions. however, if the gene duplication happened after the split between arabidopsis and populus lineages, no neofunctionalization has probably occurred yet, so the functions of these proteases are overlapping. experiments to verify this hypothesis are in progress.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis shows that different tissues express fairly unique sets of genes putatively coding for proteases. furthermore, in the developmental gradient from bud burst to leaf senescence different waves of protease gene expression occur. however, expression analysis does not always give clear evidence of function. for example, atftsh <dig> has been shown to degrade lhcii only during high light acclimation and senescence  <cit> ; although this protease is essentially constitutively expressed in leaves, its proteolytic activity is regulated by the availability of the substrate. forward or reverse genetics will be needed to obtain clear information on the involvement of various proteases in different biological processes. however, in order to make reverse genetics efficient, comparative genomics data, such as those presented in this paper, facilitate selection of the best candidates. a simple comparative analysis can provide explanations for experimental data. since the atftsh1/ftsh <dig> and atftsh2/ftsh <dig> pairs have separated after the split of lineages leading to populus and arabidopsis, it is not surprising that the pairs will have overlapping and partially redundant functions  <cit> . this means that mutant analysis, either by forward or reverse genetics, will not always provide clear answers; in many cases, biochemical analysis of protease substrate specificities will probably be needed to assign functions to the individual members of the large protease gene families.

in summary, we have identified  <dig> genes in the populus genome potentially coding for proteases and comparatively analyzed the protease composition of populus and arabidopsis.
