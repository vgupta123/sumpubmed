BACKGROUND
tightly controlled signaling pathways play critical roles in the early stages of embryogenesis and body plan formation. during gastrulation, morphogenetic movements in addition to cell proliferation and differentiation transform an embryo with a single germ layer into one with three layers, the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. in the mouse, gastrulation initiates at e <dig> , as cells of the primitive ectoderm  delaminate at the posterior side of the embryo and ingress through the primitive streak in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  <cit> . genetic approaches have identified many genes that play a role in gastrulation and/or pattern formation  <cit> . the evolutionarily conserved signal transduction cascade of wnt/β-catenin regulates patterning of the visceral endoderm, the induction of the primitive streak, and the formation of anterior neural ectoderm  <cit> . nodal and brachyury  are among the genes downstream of wnt signaling that are required for primitive streak formation  <cit> .

tenm <dig>  teneurin transmembrane protein  <dig>  is a mouse homolog of the drosophila gene tenascin major , also called odd oz   <cit> , which was originally associated with segmentation defects. ten-m is a member of the teneurin protein family and encodes a transmembrane protein with tenascin-like egf  repeats. ten-m is found in both secreted and membrane-bound forms at several compartment boundaries, suggesting a role in cell-cell communication. mutant ten-m drosophila embryos have abnormalities in neural ectoderm and mesoderm-derived tissues that result in death at the larval stage  <cit> . recently, new alleles of drosophila ten-m were identified and characterized establishing that mutations in this gene do not cause segmentation defects; instead, ten-m functions in motor neuron routing  <cit> . ten-m is expressed in the central nervous system and epidermal stripes at stages when the growth cones of intersegmental neurons  navigate to their targets. both mutation and over-expression of ten-m in epidermal cells leads to isn misrouting  <cit> . a related protein, tenascin a  has a trans-synaptic signaling role with ten-m: ten-a is presynaptic whereas ten-m is predominantly postsynaptic in neuromuscular synapse organization and target selection  <cit> .

the mouse has four teneurin transmembrane protein family members  that lack signal peptides at the n-terminus, but contain a short hydrophobic domain characteristic of transmembrane proteins followed by a region with eight egf-like repeats, and a large c-terminal domain  <cit> . the vertebrate homolog of drosophilaten-a is called tenm <dig> and the homolog of drosophila ten-m is tenm <dig>  all four mammalian tenm genes are highly expressed in the brain and each gene produces many alternatively spliced transcripts, suggesting a variety of protein functions in different tissues  <cit> . novel mutant alleles having defects in early mouse embryonic development can be identified using ethylnitrosourea  mutagenesis  <cit> . a series of enu-induced alleles at mouse 17rn <dig> <cit>  contain mutations in the tenm <dig> gene  <cit> , which exhibit a wide array of phenotypes, ranging from embryonic death at gastrulation to viable with skeletal defects  <cit> . in two loss-of-function alleles , embryos fail to gastrulate. in less severe alleles , gastrulation occurs, but body axis formation, somitogenesis, vasculogenesis, cardiogenesis, and fusion of the allantois with the chorion are disrupted leading to death at early- to mid-gestation stages. consistent with these mutant phenotypes, tenm <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in the epiblast and extraembryonic regions as early as e <dig> . by e <dig> , tenm <dig> is highly expressed in the mesoderm of the developing embryo and extraembryonic tissues. later, tenm <dig> is expressed mainly in the neuroectoderm, but expression is maintained in the tail bud, somites and limbs  <cit> .

to begin to address the biological function of tenm <dig>  the loss of function allele tenm4m <dig>  and a hypomorphic allele tenm4m <dig> were examined. tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos failed to initiate gastrulation, failed to form a primitive streak, and failed to develop mesoderm. in addition, tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos were incapable of forming any differentiated tissue. an analysis of the hypomorphic allele, tenm4m <dig>  along with the null allele, determined that mutant cells did not properly express e- or n-cadherin, suggesting that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  did not occur. moreover, the mutants failed to up-regulate a topgal reporter gene, suggesting that wnt signaling failed to occur. finally, a gsk3β inhibitor rescued the ability of the embryos to form extraembryonic mesoderm and partially rescued their ability to form embryonic mesoderm.

RESULTS
tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos arrest at the gastrulation stage
at e <dig> , wildtype and tenm4m1/m <dig> embryos were similar in appearance . at e <dig> , mutant embryos were approximately half the size of littermates , and at e <dig> , mutant embryos were arrested in development at the e <dig>  stage . prior studies showed that most embryos were dead or dying by e <dig>  and that no mutant embryos survived past e <dig>   <cit> . histology revealed phenotypic differences between wildtype and mutant embryos . at e <dig>  wild-type embryos had a well-organized ectoderm, visceral endoderm, and extraembryonic mesoderm with proamniotic and extraembryonic cavities . in contrast, mutant embryos had no sign of mesoderm . at e <dig> , wildtype embryos developed embryonic mesoderm . by e <dig> , wildtype embryos developed three primitive embryonic cavities, including the amniotic, exocoelomic and ectoplacental cavities, head folds, and embryonic and extraembryonic mesodermal tissues, including the allantois . however, no mesoderm formed and the embryonic region did not expand in tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos by e <dig>  or  <dig> , although some embryos appeared to form a morphologically abnormal extraembryonic cavity, perhaps caused by the expansion of the extraembryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm .

tenm4m1/m <dig> mutants do not produce mesoderm
brachyury is expressed prior to the onset of gastrulation at e <dig>  in the extraembryonic ectoderm adjacent to the epiblast, and shifts to the developing primitive streak, where it is a marker of mesodermal-derived notochord  <cit> . no brachyury expression was found in the embryo of tenm4m1/m <dig> mutants, although a weak signal was observed in the extraembryonic tissue in half of the mutants . the cause of the inconsistent extraembryonic expression is not clear. this is an enu-induced point mutation, and often such alleles are somewhat leaky due to read-through of the point mutation. alternatively, this observation is consistent with expression in extraembryonic ectoderm, indicating developmental delay. importantly, none of the mutants had brachyury expression in the area of the potential primitive streak. additional primitive streak markers were examined. in wildtype embryos, foxa <dig>  expression is restricted to the anterior end of the primitive streak at e <dig>  .

to determine how the tenm4m <dig> mutation affects the development of the anterior patterning of the embryo, the expression pattern of otx <dig> was examined, which is expressed uniformly in the epiblast and the anterior visceral endoderm  prior to gastrulation. the expression of otx <dig> becomes restricted to the anterior epiblast as mesoderm migrates from the primitive streak suppressing its expression in the posterior epiblast . in tenm4m1/m <dig> embryos, otx <dig> expression does not become fully restricted to the anterior epiblast, consistent with the lack of mesoderm influencing its restricted expression . bmp <dig> is expressed in the extraembryonic ectoderm adjacent to the proximal epiblast prior to gastrulation and later in the posterior primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm .

proliferation and apoptosis of epiblast cells in tenm4m1/m <dig> is similar to wild type
a threshold number of epiblast cells must be attained and maintained for gastrulation to initiate and progress  <cit> . mouse embryos that lack a normal number of cells due to abnormal cell proliferation or to cell losses will delay gastrulation until the embryo attains the appropriate number of cells. mutant embryos that fail to sustain the proliferation of epiblast cells do not initiate gastrulation or will arrest after the formation of a rudimentary primitive streak. to examine the effect of the tenm4m <dig> mutation on cellular proliferation in vivo, the incorporation of 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine  into dna was analyzed. at e <dig>  , 48% of the nuclei of wildtype or heterozygous epiblast cells were labeled with brdu after a 20-minute exposure. in tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos, 47% of the nuclei were labeled, suggesting that the proliferation of epiblast cells is normal at this time point. these data suggest that the gastrulation defect is not caused by insufficient cell proliferation in the epiblast. however, the total number of mutant epiblast cells was lower at e <dig>  , and a student’s t-test indicates that total cell numbers are significantly different . this suggests that the growth of the embryo starts to become impaired prior to e <dig> . increased apoptosis could also cause a reduced number of cells, so the tunel assay was used to examine cell death. normally, cell death occurs primarily in extraembryonic tissues, especially in trophoblast , but is rare in embryonic cells. very few apoptotic cells were observed in mutant embryos at e <dig>   or at e <dig>  .

the epiblast contains a highly regulated stem cell population that adjusts to various perturbations including major alterations in cell number and cell position. because the cells remain in an undifferentiated state until late gastrulation  <cit> , one possibility for the low cell count in tenm4m1/m <dig> at the late gastrulation stage is a precocious differentiation of epiblast stem cells. therefore, the expression of pou5f <dig> at e <dig>  was examined. pou5f <dig> is distinguished by exclusive expression in blastomeres, pluripotent cells, and the germ cell lineage  <cit> . at e <dig> , pou5f <dig> expression should be restricted to the epiblast . in mutant embryos, the expression of pou5f <dig> is similar to wildtype, indicating that undifferentiated pluripotent epiblast cells are present .

to examine differentiation potential, wildtype and mutant embryonic tissues at e <dig>  were transplanted into the testes of adult male mice and examined for the development of teratomas. after  <dig> weeks, the testes were fixed, sectioned and processed for histological analysis . teratomas derived from heterozygotes differentiated into many kinds of tissues, which are produced from all three germ layers . however, the teratomas derived from tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos produced no differentiated tissues . the size of teratomas derived from mutant embryos never exceeded  <dig> mm, whereas teratomas from wildtype embryos grew to  <dig> - <dig> cm in diameter . furthermore, approximately half of the mutant-derived teratoma cells had degenerated when examined at  <dig> weeks. only four homozygous mutant-derived teratomas survived to be genotyped out of  <dig> teratomas examined , all of which had inflammatory reactions, indicating the decay of the cells. moreover, six teratomas could not be genotyped because they were severely decomposed. mutant-derived teratomas had signs of inflammation when teratomas were assessed at 1 week after transplantation, although again, no cell differentiation was observed . together, these results suggest that the failure to differentiate is cell autonomous. to further test this question, embryos were cultured to attempt to generate embryonic stem  cells for studies of chimeras with mutant cells. although multiple es cell lines were derived from wildtype  or heterozygous  embryos, none were derived from mutants , precluding experiments on such cells. blastocysts from matings of ten-m4m <dig> heterozygotes were collected at e <dig>  and cultured in vitro to observe any defects in the inner cell mass  and/or trophectoderm outgrowth. all blastocysts attached normally to gelatin-coated dishes and completely hatched from the zona pellucida after 2– <dig> days in culture. after hatching, the growth of the icm and the extent of trophoblast outgrowth was very abnormal in ten-m4m1/m <dig> mutants . mutant cells could be easily distinguished from those from wild type or heterozygotes because they failed to adhere and could not survive more than  <dig> days in culture.

teratomas were assessed by histology after measuring the diameter of the teratoma. the teratoma sizes were categorized as large , middle  and small  and the tissue types in teratomas derived from normal and mutant embryos were categorized as ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. *not genotyped due to degrading of teratoma tissue.

expression of e-cadherin, n-cadherin and snai1
an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  is an essential step in gastrulation, which requires wnt signaling to proceed. down-regulation of e-cadherin is an early step of the emt. embryos that fail to gastrulate do not undergo the emt; however, the tenm <dig> allelic series includes a hypomorphic allele, tenm4m4/m <dig>  which gastrulates to form mesodermal tissues, including yolk sac, heart and blood vessels, yet arrests in development by e <dig>   <cit> . the m <dig> allele allows the emt to be assessed in a mutation that does not arrest before gastrulation occurs. the expression of e-cadherin in the loss of function allele tenm4m1/m <dig> and the hypomorphic allele tenm4m4/m <dig> was examined. e-cadherin was absent in the primitive streak and mesoderm of wildtype embryos, , whereas e-cadherin expression was not down regulated in the epiblast of both tenm4m1/m <dig> and tenm4m4/m <dig> . when epiblast cells delaminate at the primitive streak to form mesoderm, they switch expression from e- to n- cadherin. n-cadherin was expressed at high levels in the yolk sac and primitive streak in wildtype embryos ; however, no n-cadherin expression was observed in either tenm4m1/m <dig> or tenm4m4/m <dig> . snai <dig>  suppresses e-cadherin to initiate migration of trophoblast giant cells, which also requires the emt. no snai <dig> expression was observed in cultured ectoplacental cone mutant explants . all wildtype explants expressed snai <dig> , whereas only one tenm4m1/m <dig> explant had low snai <dig> expression, and five had none ,  <dig> %.

the topgal assay suggests that wnt signaling does not occur
drosophila ten-m affects wingless expression  <cit> . in mouse, canonical signaling by wnt <dig> is required for mesoderm induction in the early embryo  <cit> . a topgal transgenic expression reporter mouse strain, which expresses β-galactosidase under the control of three copies of the wnt-specific lef/tcf binding sites was used to assess wnt signaling in the mutants  <cit> . in wild-type e <dig>  embryos, topgal activity was detected in the primitive streak . in contrast, topgal activity was not present in tenm4m1/m <dig> e <dig>  embryos .

normally, glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  is inhibited by wnt signaling to promote stabilization of β-catenin and transcription of target genes  <cit> . to attempt to rescue the defective mesoderm induction in tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos, wnt signaling was ectopically induced with a gsk <dig> specific inhibitor, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime . its analog, 1-methyl-6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime  is a useful negative control  <cit> . when mebio was added to the embryo culture medium, tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos did not produce any mesodermal cells . however, when bio was added at  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm, extraembryonic tissue grew . even so, the embryonic region did not expand, although some cells migrated away from the epiblast . using a higher bio concentration , tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos produced allantois and chorion, which fused, suggesting that extraembryonic mesoderm was produced and differentiated . moreover, topgal signaling was induced to various degrees in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues , suggesting that wnt signaling was restored in some cells.

discussion
here we show using mouse mutants that the earliest functions of tenm <dig> are prior to gastrulation such that wnt signaling does not occur. a loss of function allele failed to gastrulate and produced no mesoderm. in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that loss of function mutant embryos did not have the potential to form differentiated tissues, a defect that was cell autonomous. further, e-cadherin and n-cadherin expression was abnormal in both loss of function and hypomorphic alleles, supporting the idea that tenm <dig> mutant cells fail to undergo the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, surprisingly even when a primitive streak forms and gastrulation occurs. the formation of embryonic cavities, along with weak expression of brachyury in extraembryonic regions and rescue of extraembryonic mesoderm by gsk inhibitors, suggests that extraembryonic mesoderm may remain competent in the mutants; however, mesoderm in the embryo proper may lack the potential to differentiate.

the phenotype of tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos is distinct from other mice with gastrulation failure. mutations in nodal, smad <dig>  smad <dig> or actr1b, which block signaling of members of the transforming growth factor beta  family, affect embryonic differentiation at the egg cylinder stage before gastrulation  <cit> . smad2-dependent nodal/activin/tgf-β signaling is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in the epiblast and in human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . tenm4m <dig> deficient embryos maintain expression of pou5f <dig> in the epiblast, suggesting that the epiblast has pluripotent potential. foxh <dig> and cripto mediate the nodal-signaling pathway  <cit> . in contrast to tenm4m <dig>  foxh1- and cripto-deficient embryos produce a primitive streak. bone morphogenic protein  signaling is also required for gastrulation, and mesoderm induction fails in type-i bmp receptor  mutants  <cit> . in contrast to tenm <dig> mutants, teratomas derived from bmpr1-/- embryos produce mesoderm-derived tissues  <cit> . bmp signaling is required for visceral endoderm differentiation and the formation of cavities in the early mouse embryo  <cit> . tenm4m1/m <dig> embryos developed normal visceral endoderm and embryonic cavities, as they maintained bmp <dig> expression in the extraembryonic ectoderm. taken together, these data suggest that the first embryonic function of tenm <dig> may not be to target tgf-β or bmp signaling.

canonical wnt signaling is essential for mesoderm formation, embryonic patterning, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal interactions. wnt <dig> plays a role in inducing mesoderm and forming the primitive streak  <cit> . although wnt <dig> mutants fail to induce mesoderm, the visceral endoderm and epiblast layers continue to grow and expand  <cit> . in contrast, tenm4m1/m <dig> embryos failed to expand the visceral endoderm and epiblast layers. mesd, which encodes the chaperone for the wnt co-receptors lrp5/ <dig>  as well as a double knockout of lrp5/ <dig>  shows phenotypes similar to the tenm4m <dig> mutant  <cit> . in these mutants, defects in extraembryonic tissues lead to failure to organize the proximal epiblast, similar to tenm4; however, in contrast, the visceral endoderm and epiblast layers continue to grow, similar to wnt <dig> mutants. β-catenin regulates cripto- and wnt3-dependent gene expression programs in mouse anterior posterior axis and mesoderm formation, controlling both the wnt and nodal pathways  <cit> . no mesoderm or head structures formed in β-catenin-deficient embryos, and markers of posterior mesoderm differentiation such as brachyury, as well as markers of a-p axis formation such as hex and hesx <dig>  were not expressed  <cit> . similar to β-catenin- and wnt3-deficient embryos, tenm4m1/m <dig> mutants failed to form a primitive streak, even though the epiblast maintained high pou5f <dig> expression, unlike mutations in smad <dig>  smad <dig> and nodal. the tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant phenotype is more similar to canonical wnt mutants than those of other pathways, yet seems to lack competency for the embryonic epiblast to differentiate into mesoderm  <cit> .

fgfr <dig> mutants that do not activate snai <dig> show defective mesoderm migration and differentiation  <cit> . the suppressor of e-cadherin, snai <dig>  was not up-regulated in cultured mutant ectoplacental cone explants of the hypomorphic mutant tenm4m <dig>  these data, combined with knowledge of tenm family egf structural motifs, membrane orientation, and known secreted and membrane-bound forms, suggest that tenm <dig> may be an important molecule for proper adhesion of migrating extraembryonic cells. embryo cultures indicated that a gsk3β inhibitor induced the outgrowth of extraembryonic tissues, and partially rescued defective mesoderm induction, particularly in extraembryonic tissues. the activity of gsk inhibitors is not restricted to wnt signaling, and in fact, can influence cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . furthermore, the inhibitors did not fully rescue the mutant phenotypes, suggesting that other pathways are likely to be involved.

the wnt pathway has evolved to interact with many receptors in a variety of signaling pathways that are independent of canonical signaling, see  <cit>  for review. for example, non-canonical wnt signaling is required for planar cell polarity and convergent extension  <cit> . in addition to its essential roles in gastrulation, stem cell homeostasis and axis patterning, the wnt pathway plays a key role in neuronal development and maintenance. in particular, non-canonical wnt signaling is crucial for path finding during axonal navigation as well as for synapse formation  <cit> . drosophila ten-m binds with filamins via its filamin-binding domain to reorganize the cytoskeleton during axon guidance  <cit> , a function of non-canonical wnt signaling. ten-m is expressed in muscle, but interacts with ten-a at the neuromuscular synapse, evidencing its role in cell-cell communication during synapse organization and function  <cit> . recently, a large-scale genome-wide association study  identified an intronic variant in tenm <dig>  as being associated with bipolar disorder, a severe mood disorder that affects over 1% of the population  <cit> . wnt signaling is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism  <cit> . therefore, it will be intriguing to determine if tenm <dig> has a direct role in wnt signaling; however, evidence for this will require the analysis of other tenm <dig> alleles, which have abnormal body axis patterning or abnormal neural development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data show that tenm <dig> is required for mesoderm induction during gastrulation, and that gastrulation arrests at a stage prior to that in which wnt signaling occurs. tenm4m1/m <dig> mutants have a phenotype that is distinct from other mutants with gastrulation failure, but is most similar to that of β-catenin, which affects both the wnt and nodal pathways. a gsk3β inhibitor rescued the ability of mutant embryos to form extraembryonic mesoderm and partially rescued the mutant embryos’ ability to form embryonic mesoderm. gsk <dig> can also affect adhesion complexes independent of wnt signaling. given that tenm <dig> is a cell adhesion molecule that acts at neuronal synapses in flies, it is possible that cell-cell interactions are perturbed in the mutants, preventing the communication required for gastrulation to proceed. further work will be required to fully understand the signaling pathways involved in this intriguing and important molecule.
