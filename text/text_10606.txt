BACKGROUND
protein kinase c  was discovered almost thirty years ago by takai et al  <cit> . it has since been shown to include several isoforms, all of which are serine/threonine kinases  <cit> . the pkc isoforms are divided into three subgroups; the conventional, the novel and the atypical pkcs depending on their structure and requirements for activation  <cit> . pkc is activated by a range of different stimuli, including growth factors and hormones  <cit> , and it plays a key role in several cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart failure  <cit> .

in previous studies, we have demonstrated that in experimental ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage  there is an upregulation of endothelin type b  receptors in the cerebral arteries  <cit> . there are two known endothelin receptors in the vasculature of mammals, the endothelin a  and endothelin b  receptor  <cit> . the etb receptors are normally situated on the endothelial cells, mediating dilatation, but in the case of sah and experimental ischemic stroke there is an upregulation of contractile etb receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> . this alteration is also seen in organ culture of middle cerebral arteries   <cit> . in both sah and organ culture this upregulation is attenuated by pkc inhibitors  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to examine if a general pkc inhibitor, ro-32- <dig>  can decrease the etb receptor upregulation in mca and reduce the ischemic infarct volume after experimental ischemic stroke. transient middle cerebral artery occlusion  was induced by an intraluminal filament technique and ro-32- <dig> was injected intraperitoneally  in conjunction with the occlusion. the ro-32- <dig> treatment decreased the etb receptor upregulation, as well as diminished the ischemic infarct area and improved the neurological status of the animals. moreover, immunohistochemistry showed enhanced expression of etb receptor protein in the ipsilateral mca of the control rats. this enhancement was not seen in the ipsilateral mca of the ro-32- <dig> treated animals, which confirms the contractile results.

RESULTS
middle cerebral artery occlusion
in all included animals, a proper occlusion and reperfusion was confirmed by laser-doppler flowmetry in the cortex area supplied by the mca. there was no difference in blood flow between the control group and the ro-32- <dig> treated group. before occlusion map, po <dig>  pco <dig>  ph and plasma glucose were measured, and there were no differences between the groups. the body temperature usually increases temporarily the first hours after mca occlusion  <cit> , a phenomenon confirmed in this study. there was no difference in weight loss during the reperfusion period. all physiological parameters in conjunction with the operation are summarized in table  <dig> 

the neurological scores differed between the groups;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in control group compared to  <dig>  in the ro-32- <dig> treated group . for definition of the neurological scoring system, see table  <dig> 

infarct volume evaluation
analysis of the infarct volume after staining with ttc revealed that treatment with ro-32- <dig> significantly decreased the size of the ischemic infarct area as compared to the control group; control:  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and ro-32-0432:  <dig> % ±  <dig> % .

myograph experiments
k+-induced contractions did not differ between the control group and the ro-32-0432-treated group .

the contractile response towards sarafotoxin 6c  was decreased in the right mca of the ro-32- <dig> treated rats compared to the right mca of the control rats  <dig> hours after the occlusion. this difference was significant at s6c concentrations of 10- <dig>  – 10- <dig>  m . following s6c administration, the etb receptors are desensitized, leaving only eta receptors to interact with endothelin- <dig>   <cit> .

the contractile response towards et- <dig> did not differ between the groups. however, there was a significant increase in the right mca compared to the left mca of the ro-32- <dig> group. all values are summarized in table  <dig> 

immunohistochemistry
in the control group, immunohistochemistry confirmed an enhanced expression of etb receptor protein in the smooth muscle cells of the right mca after transient mcao. this enhancement was abolished in the right mcas of the rats treated with the pkc inhibitor ro-32- <dig>  there were no differences in etb receptor staining between the left mcas. n =  <dig> in all groups, figures are representative for the groups .

discussion
protein kinase c has long been known to be involved in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia  <cit> . however, the underlying mechanisms of its involvement are still unclear, possibly due to different roles of the pkc isoforms in the pathophysiology of the disease  <cit> . for example, pkcδ activation in experimental cerebral ischemia has proven to be deleterious  <cit> , while the pkcγ isoform is potentially beneficial  <cit> .

here we show for the first time that i.p. administration of ro-32- <dig>  an inhibitor known for its pkc selectivity, decreases the infarct volume and improves the neurological score of the rats  <dig> hours after transient mcao. furthermore, the contractile etb receptor upregulation seen in the ipsilateral mca of the control animals is attenuated by the ro-32- <dig> treatment. it has previously been shown that there is an enhanced contraction of the pial vessels overlying the penumbra, which may worsen the ischemic damage  <cit> . a normalization of the vascular responses towards endothelin may contribute to the beneficial outcome of treatment with ro-32- <dig> in the present animal model of transient mcao.

the effect of endothelin receptor inhibition in cerebral ischemia has been widely studied, but the results have not been conclusive  <cit> . our group has previously shown that in addition to an ischemia-induced endothelin receptor upregulation, there is an alteration in the vascular angiotensin ii receptor response after experimental cerebral ischemia  <cit> . this points towards a more general receptor modification in the affected arteries. therefore a specific et receptor blocker may not be the most useful way of treatment, but rather an inhibitor of the pathways leading to the receptor changes.

we have previously shown that inhibition of the  extracellular-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  pathway has a similar beneficial effect on et receptor alterations, ischemic infarction area and neurological score after mcao as the pkc inhibition in the present study  <cit> . this is also seen in organ culture, where the upregulation of contractile etb receptors in mca is attenuated by both pkc inhibitors and erk1/ <dig> inhibitors  <cit> .

since the erk1/ <dig> kinase can be phosphorylated and activated by pkc, this suggests a common intracellular pathway for these kinases in the cerebral ischemia pathophysiology. however, further studies are needed to confirm this connection and to elucidate which of the isoforms of pkc that are involved. moreover, whether the decrease in cerebral infarct volume is due to pkc inhibition in the neuronal tissue or an effect of the attenuation of the etb receptor upregulation in the arteries remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
treatment with the pkc inhibitor ro-32- <dig> reduces the upregulation of etb receptors in the ipsilateral mca  <dig> hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. in addition, the ischemic infarction area is decreased and the neurological status improved by the pkc inhibition. these results provide new insights into the beneficial effects of pkc inhibition in cerebral ischemia.
