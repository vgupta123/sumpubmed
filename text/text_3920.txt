BACKGROUND
the generation scotland scottish family health study  is a family-based genetic epidemiology study which includes  <dig>  participants in ~ <dig>  family groups from across scotland. participants were recruited by letter of invitation from general practitioner lists to provide a representative sampling of the population. there was no selection on the basis of medical status or history. all were interviewed and clinically assessed for a wide range of health-related traits and environmental covariates, and linked also to routine health records  <cit> . ten thousand of these participants, of whom ~ <dig>  are not known to be directly related, also have genotypic information for ~700 k snps. the cohort was designed as a resource for genetic and health-related research. so far, projects based on this cohort are underway to study the genetics of depression, the prediction of cardiovascular disease risk, or the role of specific genes in asthma, bronchitis and emphysema, but the potential uses of gs:sfhs are much wider . the gs:sfhs cohort is a family-based study, and a fair proportion of individuals in the population will be related, some unknowingly. this structure will allow the shared variation between individuals within families to be disentangled into its genetic and environmental components and should facilitate accurate estimations of heritability. in addition, genome-wide association studies to be carried using the gs:sfhs cohort will need to adequately account for population substructure. without proper correction, false-positive results can arise as a consequence of stratification differences, particularly between cases and controls, because of allele frequency differences or differences in ld patterns . as genomic relationships are an integral part of the statistical methods used to unravel or utilise trait variation and affect their performance  <cit>  a detailed genomic description of the structure of gs:sfhs is a prerequisite to the application of these mapping and prediction methods. furthermore, such description will shed some light on the demographic history, the existence and characterization of hidden ancestral structure and the amount and origin of the variability in the population.

our aim was to provide an accurate genomic description of the gs:sfhs cohort, which could reflect as well the history of scottish population. for that purpose, we developed several genomic approaches using the information of ~700 k snps in the individuals of the cohort. our objectives were to: 1) place gs:sfhs in the context of other human populations by exploring their genetic variation and establish the ancestry of participants, 2) identify the extent and the origin of rare haplotypes in gs:sfhs individuals, 3) explore genetic differentiation within gs:sfhs, 4) analyse homozygosity in the gs:sfhs cohort, 5) identify the extent of geographic differentiation within the sample, and 6) apply the knowledge gained from these studies to identify a core set of samples to select the most appropriate for different future analyses.

these exhaustive analyses will not only reflect an accurate picture of the demographic history of scotland, but also will have implications for our further studies using the gs:sfhs cohort in terms of the genomic differentiation found among its individuals,  which will help select the most appropriate groups of individuals for each future analysis. these studies could include a detailed analysis of the contributions of common and rare variants to trait heritabilities, haplotype mapping, and evaluation of genomic and phenotypic prediction of disease.

RESULTS
placing generation scotland in a global genomic context
we performed a set of analyses to place gs:sfhs into context of a sample of other global populations. first, we merged gs:sfhs with the data of  <dig> individuals from the  <dig> genomes project , and we calculated a genomic relationship matrix  from the marker data of the resulting data set . then, we performed a principal component analysis  of the grm. results of the pca of the grm in the population gs + 1 kg are presented in fig. 1: fig. 1a shows a plot of the first two pcs ; fig. 1b shows a detail of the same figure including only the gs:sfhs individuals, fig. 1c shows a plot of the third and fourth pcs and fig. 1d shows a plot of the fifth and sixth pcs. plots for pcs 7– <dig> are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> table  <dig> origin, location, number of individuals and given values for latitude and longitude for the different populations in the gs + 1 kg data set

the first and second principal component separated the african , east asian  and european  populations . american populations  spread over the plot between the three main groups . african ancestry individuals living in the us  were more spread towards the european populations than the two populations from africa  which remained separated in a more consistent group, owing to the history of european contributions to asw. the east asian populations formed a tight group clearly independent of the rest. when looking at the plot of gs:sfhs within this graph , it can be noticed that a very small but obvious proportion of gs:sfhs individuals leaned towards the african population, whereas a similarly small but also obvious proportion were closer to the east asian populations. this analysis suggests that some gs:sfhs participants have mixed ethnic backgrounds. for example,  <dig> individuals have values for pc <dig> or pc <dig> more than  <dig> standard deviations away from the mean. they are plotted as open blue circles in fig. 1b.

if we look at further pcs, we observed, as shown in fig.  <dig>  that the third and fourth pcs reflected some variation within the mexican population from la  and african origin populations, respectively . for both eigenvectors gs:sfhs individuals were located together with the 1 kg european populations.

the fifth pc separated the italian population from tuscany from the rest of the populations . however, some individuals from gs:sfhs clustered with this italian group consistent with them having some similar ancestry.

in the sixth pc of the grm of gs + 1 kg, a different pattern appears. for this pc the individuals from most of the populations are separated in three clear clusters, mostly detected in gs:sfhs because of its larger sample size. the snps causing this clustering are located in chromosome  <dig>  in the 8p <dig>  region. a known common inversion polymorphism is located in this region  <cit>  suggesting that it might be the cause of the clustering pattern we observe.

generation scotland in a european genomic context
to place generation scotland into a european context we performed a pca of a random sample of  <dig> individuals of gs:sfhs together with the european samples of 1 kg  and  <dig> orcadian individuals  and  <dig> croatian individuals . results are shown in fig.  <dig> for pc  <dig> and pc  <dig>  the plot shows a distribution of populations similar to a map of europe  as in  <cit> , where the italian , iberian  and croatian  populations are located at the bottom of the plot , the finnish  and orcadian  populations in the top  and the rest mostly in the centre. gs:sfhs is located consistently between orkney and the british  population.fig.  <dig> results of the pca in the gs + european data set. values for pc <dig> and pc <dig> in generation scotland and the other european samples



genetic structure due to rare alleles
to thoroughly explore the ancestries of the individuals in the gs:sfhs cohort and gain insight into the potential origins of the outliers we analysed the patterns of allele sharing described by genomic relationship coefficients. it is clear from the formulation of the standard estimator  that shared rare alleles can have a substantial influence on estimates in the grm. to measure the influence of the rare alleles in the relationships between individuals of gs:sfhs we used three scores:  <cit>  an individual marker score that measures how each marker contributes in an individual to its relationships with the rest of the population;  <cit>  a pair marker score that measures how each marker affects the relationship between a particular pair of individuals; and  <cit>  a rarity score to measure the overall amount of rare variants that an individual has. the details of these calculations are provided in the methods section.

table  <dig> demonstrates the impact of the inclusion of rare alleles in our data, by showing the values for the genomic relationship coefficients truncating the snp data at different allele frequencies between selected extreme examples of pairs of individuals that are not related to each other according to the pedigree . a comparison between the values of relationship coefficients obtained when using different allele frequency thresholds for the whole population are presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  indicating that only for a small minority of relationships does the inclusion of rare alleles make a difference. the genomic relationship coefficients obtained using all the markers for the pairs of individuals in table  <dig> show values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , which are around the values expected for third and first degree relatives respectively, and are unlikely to arise between unrelated individuals. when we re-estimated the relationships between the same pairs of individuals, excluding snps with rare alleles, these relationships decreased to lower values  as expected between unrelated or distantly related individuals. to explore the impact of rare alleles in individual relationships across the genome we selected the first pair of individuals in table  <dig> to analyse further their relationship. results are plotted in fig.  <dig>  figure 3a and b show the individual marker scores  <cit>  of each individual respectively. figure 3c shows their pair marker score  <cit>  and figure 3d shows the rarity scores for both individuals  <cit> .table  <dig> genomic relationship coefficients between several pairs of individuals using different thresholds for the computation of the grm

the peaks for the individual marker scores in each of the graphs  represent areas where the individuals carry some rare alleles . the snps causing the inflated relationship are represented by the pair marker score in fig. 3c. the rare alleles that both individuals share are located in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which demonstrate common peaks in fig. 3a and b. figure 3d shows the rarity score of individual  <dig> plotted as a cumulative score, where number and magnitude of changes in the slope, as well as the total rarity score value, are greater than for individual  <dig>  the remaining pairs in table  <dig> showed a similar pattern of sharing when plotting their individual and pair scores.

the same graphs are plotted in additional file 1: figure s <dig> for two randomly selected gs:sfhs individuals. the number of peaks is lower than in the previous plot, with a few sparse high values, and no peaks in the pair score. both individuals’ rarity score are considerably smaller than the previous shown in fig.  <dig> 

in the case of an individual carrying an exogenous allele, it is expected that it will increase the rarity score because it would be at low frequency . we analysed the origin of these low frequency alleles by selecting markers in the population contributing to the rarity score with a value larger than  <dig>   and plotting the frequencies for those alleles in the african, east asian and european populations of the 1 kg data set. the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  the analysis of the probable origin of the rare alleles shows that while the frequency of these alleles is nearly always close to zero in the european populations their values in east asian and particularly african populations are clearly higher, suggesting an african origin for the majority of the cases.fig.  <dig> origin of rare alleles in gs:sfhs. frequencies for rare generation scotland alleles  in the a african, b asian and c european populations of the  <dig> genomes data set



additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows a histogram for the rarity score values  <cit>  for all the individuals in gs:sfhs. the mean value for rarity scores was  <dig> ,738 ±  <dig> . using the rarity scores in windows of  <dig> snps, we calculated the number of rare peaks in all the individuals . the mean number of peaks per individual is  <dig>  and the mean total coverage of peaks is  <dig>  mb. those individuals with a total coverage of peaks larger than the mean plus three times the standard deviation were considered outliers . table  <dig> shows the mean, maximum and minimum number of peaks in outliers and non-outliers. results show that individuals classified as non-outliers have a mean of  <dig>  rare peaks over their genome whereas outliers have on average  <dig> . in addition, the total coverage of the peaks is very different between both groups, with the mean coverage in the non-outliers being  <dig>  mb  and  <dig>  mb for the outliers . histograms showing the distribution of the percentage of rare genome and the number of peaks in the non-outliers and the outliers are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> table  <dig> distribution of the peaks detected using the rarity scores in windows of  <dig> snps in the two groups of individuals 

table shows mean, maximum and minimum number of peaks and total peak size per individual



these values can help characterise the two groups of individuals. the non-outliers have a few sparse and small peaks in their genome potentially reflecting a point mutation . on the other hand, the individuals defined as outliers can reflect a different kind of ancestry: the size of the peaks suggests that these individuals have a more admixed background, due to having a recent foreign ancestor.

we checked the self-reported origin of the  <dig> individuals detected as outliers and although the amount of non-disclosed information is slightly higher than in the whole data set, the recorded origin of their grandparents did not indicate that they came from outside the uk.

individual ancestries using admixture
to provide additional evidence of our results, we analysed a subset of markers in approximate linkage equilibrium with the software admixture  <cit>  to estimate the proportion of ancestral populations in gs + 1 kg individuals assuming  <dig> ancestral populations, i.e., african, asian and european . additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the proportion of each origin in the individuals of 1 kg and gs:sfhs. the correlation between the estimated proportion of african origin and the percentage of the genome covered by peaks was  <dig>  showing that our estimates correspond well with percentage of african genes in the individuals .

areas of high linkage disequilibrium in generation scotland
areas in high linkage disequilibrium can drive a lot of variation in the pcs, as we observed with the inversion in chromosome  <dig> and mhc in chromosome  <dig>  which is responsible of the clustering observed for several pcs  <cit> . in order to detect other large regions in ld which could represent inversions, conserved regions, etc., we performed a pca per chromosome in the gs + 1 kg population. the most extreme examples of clustering are shown in fig.  <dig> and the complete plots for pc  <dig> to  <dig> per chromosome are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> selected results from chromosomal pca. location of gs:sfhs individuals  for pc  <dig> and  <dig>  and several pcs showing a distinct pattern . the colours show the correspondence between the groups shown in pc  <dig> and  <dig> when using the whole genome, and those obtained when analysing only chromosome  <dig> for pc  <dig> and 3



the plots of pc three and/or four showed a three-cluster pattern for some of the chromosomes. in some cases the three groups were clearly distinguishable , and in some others the pattern was created by combining both eigenvectors together or it became less clear . sometimes two different clustering patterns could be seen in both the third and fourth pcs  .

the snps responsible for the pcs clustering were chromosome-wide for the first and second pcs for all chromosomes, showing a very similar pattern  and to the clustering of individuals obtained for the original genome-wide pca . this shows that the differences driven by the first two eigenvectors between all the individuals of gs:sfhs and the rest of the origins are genome-wide and consistent between chromosomes, representing differences across populations.

a summary of a literature review aiming to identify plausible causes of the other observed three-cluster patterns in the different pcs can be found in additional file 2: table s <dig>  including genes located in the identified regions. these areas appear to be regions of high linkage disequilibrium, so that individuals inherited long haplotypes and that caused the clustering pattern observed. this linkage disequilibrium could be due to different reasons, such as selection, including past selective sweeps around new alleles/mutations, or long inversions, or chance. in chromosome  <dig>  the snps causing the observed clustering for pc <dig>  is likely due to the lactase gene which has been shown to display clines of variation due to selection  <cit> . in addition, the snps in the region 8p <dig>   caused the pattern in pc  <dig> and  <dig> of chromosome 8; and in chromosome  <dig> the mhc was identified as the cause the clustering in pcs  <dig> to  <dig>  this area has previously been suggested to display selection pressure associated variation  <cit> . mhc associated snps showed a lot of influence in the whole genome pca, accounting for the variation explained by several pcs. some centromeric areas were also detected as responsible for the variance explained in several pcs. with respect of the other three group patterns detected, we found several genes located in the areas involved  that could be responsible for the clustering. in the case of chromosome  <dig> pc <dig>  only one gene is located in the responsible area, aldh1a <dig> .

runs of homozygosity in generation scotland
in order to explore the patterns of homozygosity in gs:sfhs, we estimated the length and location of homozygous segments in each individual of the cohort . additional file 1: figure s10a shows the distribution of the number of segments per individual and additional file 1: figure s10b the distribution of the total length of the homozygous segments per individual. additional file 1: figure s10c shows the number of rohs compared to the total length of rohs and additional file 1: figure s10d the proportion of individuals with one or more rohs of a given length. the distribution of the homozygous segments in gs:sfhs is similar to those described in other studies in european populations  <cit> . when comparing the results with those obtained for the controls of the scottish colon cancer study  we observed that the percentage of large rohs described in gs:sfhs is slightly higher than that found in soccs, which is also a mainland scottish population  <cit> .

the analysis also revealed that one female individual carried a completely homozygous chromosome  <dig> suggesting an instance of uniparental disomy. genomic information from other related individuals pointed out that she had inherited two copies of the paternal chromosome  <dig> 

to evaluate the possible association between roh and the rarity score in the gs:sfhs individuals, we performed a linear regression between the total length of homozygous segments or the number of runs per individual and the values for the rarity score. the rarity score showed a negative correlation with both total length and number of roh  suggesting that more homozygous individuals would have less rare haplotypes.

population structure within generation scotland
to unravel any possible link between the genomic differentiation and geographic stratification in the sample we created a pruned subset of snps in approximate linkage equilibrium with each other in order to capture the structure that reflects geographic origin. we removed all the markers from chromosome  <dig>  and markers in chromosome  <dig> located in the region  <dig> p <dig> , since both areas have been proven to have a big impact on the pca  <cit> . also, to remove familiar structure, we removed related individuals from the data set , individuals detected as having italian origin, and those with mixed ethnic backgrounds. the resulting data set consisted in  <dig> unrelated individuals. results are presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig> for pc one to twenty. in order to evaluate the impact of origin within scotland on the pcs of the gs:sfhs participants, we assigned a value for latitude and longitude according to their birthplaces and calculated the regression of the eigenvectors on the geographic coordinates . the results are shown in table  <dig>  most of the pcs  showed a significant association with geographic origin. in all of these cases the longitude was significant, and the latitude was significant for some pcs. longitude explained  <dig> % of the variance within pc  <dig>  and both latitude and longitude jointly explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of pc  <dig> and pc  <dig> respectively. the significant models for the rest of pcs  explained a very small proportion of the variance . this shows that geography has an impact on the genomic variation of gs:sfhs, especially on that contributing to principal components  <dig> to  <dig>  to further investigate this influence we used the recorded origin of grandparents, in order to obtain a more accurate picture of the individual’s “genetic origin”, so we selected a subset of individuals consisting in those with four grandparents coming from the same area . we used this new subset  to calculate a new regression of the principal components on the geographic coordinates. the results are shown in table  <dig>  most of the pcs were significant but in this case latitude and longitude explained  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of pcs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. a plot of the first three principal components is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we used the values of the principal components to predict the “genomic” latitude and longitude of each individual, i.e., to predict where a given individual comes from “genomically”. figure  <dig> shows the results of the predicted values. figure 6a shows the observed latitude and longitude of “genetic origin” of the individuals according to their grandparents’ origin. the size of the points in fig. 6a reflects the number of individuals with origin from a given region. figure 6b shows the results of the predicted values of latitude and longitude using pcs  <dig> to  <dig>  the colours show the observed origin using the same coding as fig. 6a. the results show that the prediction of latitude and longitude corresponds well with the observed origin. the correlation between the real and predicted latitude was  <dig>  and the correlation between the real and predicted longitude was  <dig> .table  <dig> areas in scotland, number of individuals in the cohort born in each of the areas, number of individuals with the four grandparents coming from that area, and values of latitude and longitude used for each of the areas in the regression analyses

impact of population structure and geographic location on health-related traits
to explore the impact of the region of “genomic” origin  and the area of residence of the individuals in a variety of health-related traits, we used two different mixed linear models. we explored the variance explained by a similarity matrix constructed using the values of predicted latitude and longitude . we fitted a mixed linear model as in  <cit>  including a grm and the similarity matrix , estimated using gcta  <cit>  the proportion of the phenotypic variance captured by each of these matrices, and compared them when including or not the current area of residence as a fixed effect. the results of the analysis are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> for body mass index , fat, waist-to-hip ratio  and high density lipoprotein . in all scenarios, the matrix geo explained a small but significant amount of the trait variance and this remained the case when current area of residence was included in the model.

we also explored the effects of sex, age, age <dig>  predicted latitude and longitude  and the current area of residence when fitted in a mixed linear model with a grm. results are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> for the four traits. the results show that longitude is significant for fat and whr with the effect being reduced values further east in both traits. some of the areas of residence show also significant effects.

discussion
historic and demographic events leave their signatures in the genomes of populations. these genomic marks allow us to track relationships, reconstruct introgression events and find different patterns in the populations that can be linked with structural variation or reflect areas in high linkage disequilibrium. this study provides a detailed picture of the genetic structure within the gs:sfhs cohort and some historic demographic events that have shaped the genomes of its individuals.

our analyses showed some expected patterns together with some valuable information regarding gs:sfhs individuals. the first and second principal components of the genomic relationship matrix in the gs + 1 kg population separated the european from the african and east asian populations respectively. they also showed that a few individuals from the scottish population have a variable pattern of genes from different ancestries, with part of this group of individuals having more than a  <dig> % of non-european origin according to the rare allele analysis. these non-european regions are too large to be explained as random mutations or genotyping errors. it is widely accepted that the eurasian populations were originated from a single “out of africa” event  <cit> , and that the african populations are genetically more diverse than european and asian samples because of this bottleneck  <cit> . this means that rare alleles in europe may be common in africa. gabriel et al.  <cit>  estimated that half of the human genome exists in blocks of 44 kb or larger in european populations with a maximum of 173 kb blocks. even considering that the blocks in gs:sfhs could be larger, the length of the regions described by gabriel et al.  <cit>  still suggests that the “out of africa” bottleneck cannot explain haplotypes of up to 7 mb with rare variants, indicating that the outliers have a relatively recent ancestor likely coming from an african population. also, wall and pritchard  <cit>  reviewed several studies of haplotype blocks in human populations and showed the correlation between the recombination rate and the length of the regions. we checked the recombination rate in some of the regions that we detected and it was close or larger to the  <dig>  cm/mb expectation  <cit> , which indicates that the long non-european regions we uncover are not the result of regions of low recombination. these individuals should probably be removed from the data set for subsequent analyses, such as common and rare variants contribution to heritability, haplotype mapping, genomic prediction of disease, etc., otherwise allele frequencies differences could bias results.

the rest of the population appears to be more homogeneous when analysing the results of the pca and the rare allele analysis. they show an average proportion of peaks of  <dig>  % and a more compact clustering pattern. this  <dig>  % of peaks is likely to reflect, at least partially, point mutations that occurred in recent generations. some of these mutations could also be genotyping errors, but we cannot differentiate them.

the pattern of rare alleles detected is highly influenced by the snps genotyped so it is likely that the ascertainment bias of the chip has an impact on our results. whereas with a different chip different variants might have been detected as coming from other populations, we do not expect spurious results arising because of this in the rare allele analysis.

the correlation between the estimated proportion of african origin using admixture and the percentage of the genome covered by peaks was high  showing that our estimates correspond well with percentage of african genes in the individuals . our estimates of asian ancestry seem to be underestimated when compared to the admixture results.

despite the homogeneity of the majority of the population , it would probably still be useful to correct for some subjacent population structure in further analyses by including the eigenvectors as covariates in the models in future association studies or heritability estimations  <cit> .

regarding the homozygosity patterns, the distribution of the number of homozygous segments and their length in gs:sfhs was similar to that described in previous studies in other european populations   <cit> . however, the proportion of individuals carrying large rohs was slightly higher than found previously in the soccs population  <cit> , particularly for those roh between  <dig>  and 5 mb . rarity scores showed a negative correlation with the number and total length of roh as expected, since the more admixed individuals are in general less homozygous.

we identified a group of individuals with italian ancestry in gs:sfhs through their similarity with the tuscan individuals in the  <dig> genomes populations . this is consistent with a large influx of italian immigration to scotland at the end of xix century and beginning of xx century . the italians in gs:sfhs appear as a distinct group from the rest of the population in the pca, but they do not seem to differ much when analysing their rare alleles. the values of their rarity scores do not appear as outliers in the population. this implies that there are not big differences in their allele frequencies when comparing to the rest of gs:sfhs . as the architecture of allelic frequencies is the same, we can assume that the underlying architecture of complex traits will be very similar as well. we consider that these individuals could be included for most of the future analyses if the population structure is accounted for using whole genome marker information. regarding the rest of the european populations, gs:sfhs individuals are located between britain and orcadian populations as expected and further away from more southern populations.

the genome-wide information in gs:sfhs allowed us to discover some other variation. the inversion in chromosome  <dig> is one of the largest polymorphic inversions found in humans  with a frequency of ~20– <dig> % in european populations, ~ <dig> % in the yoruba and ~12– <dig> % in asians  <cit> . it can be predicted from genotypes  <cit>  and it was previously identified via principal components by zou et al.  <cit> . this information suggests that selection against crossovers in the region maintains the linkage disequilibrium pattern  <cit> . previous studies that detected this inversion, were capable of detecting a smaller  inversion in chromosome  <dig>  with a  <dig> % frequency in europeans  <cit> . we did not find any signal for any of the snps in any of the principal components in chromosome  <dig> pointing at that area.

the chromosome  <dig> inversion proves that a linkage disequilibrium region can be detected using genotypes and principal component analysis. the similar clustering patterns in the rest of the chromosomes discovered through the chromosomal pca suggest regions of between  <dig> kb  and ~ <dig>  mb  in high linkage disequilibrium. this long haplotype patterns could be informative of selective sweeps in the past that have not been broken down by recombination. for some of these areas expected results pointed out the variation due to selection of the lactase gene  or the major histocompatibility complex in chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the other areas identified contain several genes, and it is difficult to pinpoint more accurately the specific gene or region that causes the observed clustering pattern, which could suggest some selective pressure over it.

as others, we have shown that the geographic differentiation between populations from different origins  is detected in the pca but we have also found that the geographic origin within scotland has a significant impact on the principal components. we were able to predict with relative high accuracy the origin of the individuals from their genomic data. the small number of samples from the islands , and hence their limited influence in the pca, made that prediction of the origin of these individuals was somehow poorer than that of individuals from regions with more genotyped participants. most of the families participating in the study were recruited in big cities  and the information from the grandparents’ origin is often not complete. this could affect the results obtained from our origin prediction analysis, for which prediction was more efficient at separating individuals from the south-west from those of the north-east of scotland .

when we explored the impact of predicted location based on information from the regions of origin of the individual’s grandparents  and current place of residence on four health-related traits , we observed that genomic origin had an impact on these traits. in the four cases, the similarity matrix based on geographic proximity significantly captured some phenotypic variance, irrespective of including current region of residence in the model. also, when examining the effects of predicted latitude and predicted longitude we observed that longitude had a significant effect for fat and whr but latitude did not, when both variables were jointly fitted. it has to be noticed that the distribution of the samples over scotland makes latitude and longitude correlated to each other . after adding to the model the current region of residence of the individuals, the predicted longitude of genomic origin was still significant, and similar results were obtained when we replaced current region of residence with region of birth . although these associations with genomic origin as predicted by grandparental birthplace and are not removed by adjustment for either an individual’s place of birth or current place of residence, it is possible that they are the result of undetected stratification in the sample. this could include, for example, persistence of cultural transmission of lifestyle or dietary habits associated with grandparental origins.

CONCLUSIONS
all these results will have an important impact over future studies that use the gs:sfhs cohort and correspond well with known scottish demographic history. we have performed a thorough analysis of genomic data in gs:sfhs, applying standard methods such as the use of pca, but also inspecting the results of such analyses in depth we have discovered some individuals with mixed ancestries that should be removed for future studies  and we have characterised some other that can remain in the cohort.
