BACKGROUND
heat stress threatens future prospects of increased grain production in crops. rice  is most important world food crop. the production of rice is getting severely affected with increases in mean global temperature. according to estimates, yield of rice declines by 10% for every 1°c increase in growing period minimum temperature in the dry season  <cit> . processes like spikelet fertility, grain quality and yield processes in rice are considered to be especially sensitive to heat stress  <cit> . for breeding heat tolerant rice, it is important that molecular components that underlie the heat shock response in this species are understood  <cit> . microarray profiling data have shown that heat stress response in maturing tomato microspores involves heat shock proteins, ros scavengers, hormones and sugars  <cit> . understandably, the major molecular changes in rice plants as affected by heat stress need to be worked out. this is especially relevant since rice has emerged as a model plant species of the group monocots due to its small genome size, availability of large collection of full-length cdnas  and for the fact that the whole genome of this plant species is completely sequenced. this crop has attracted a great deal of efforts for the elucidation of gene functions; completion of genome sequencing in rice has paved way for comprehensive functional characterization of genes, transcription factors, signaling components and promoters  <cit> . the completed rice genome sequence has been used for the characterization of a large number of gene families involved in diverse processes and pathways. however, with almost  <dig> genes  <cit> , several of them unknown, there are ample proteins still left to be characterized in this important crop species. in recent years, comprehensive details on heat shock regulated rice hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsf gene families have been reported  <cit> . hsp <dig> is a major heat-regulated protein family in diverse organisms. across the living systems, common features of hsp <dig> chaperone action include transient interactions with non-native protein species, in the prevention of aggregation and promotion of correct folding and assembly, or in unfolding for translocation or targeting to proteases. singla and grover  <cit>  showed that homologues of yeast hsp <dig> protein are expressed in heat shocked rice seedlings. it was subsequently established that apart from heat, rice hsp <dig> expression is developmentally-controlled as seeds and developing embryos of rice show high constitutive levels of this protein  <cit> .

hsp <dig> proteins belong to clpb family  <cit> . clp atpases maintain quality of cellular proteins by performing the function of molecular chaperones and energy dependent proteases. clp  system was first identified as a heat shock inducible, multicomponent, atp-dependent protease complex able to hydrolyze casein  <cit> . subsequent studies showed that the clp system can hydrolyze numerous other proteins and peptides in both aggregated and non-aggregated forms  <cit>  clp atpases fall within the aaa+ superfamily of atpases associated with a substantially broader range of biological processes  <cit> . class i atpases  have two atp binding domains and class ii clp atpases  have one atp binding domain  <cit> . clp proteins are localized in various cellular organelles in plants  <cit> . basically, clp system members include three non-homologous gene families: clpabcxy, clpp and clpq. clpacx members  facilitate the activity of clpp and some, such as clpa  <cit>  and clpx  <cit> , can function as independent chaperones in roles analogous to those of dnak and dnaj proteins. in contrast, clpp proteolytic subunit exhibits low levels of peptidolytic activity. further, when clpp is complexed with clpa, clpc or clpx, active holoenzymes which are able to cleave denatured proteins are formed. clpap, clpxp and hsluv proteases are similar in design to the eukaryotic  <dig> s proteasome, with the atpase subunits guarding the entrance to the proteolytic chamber  <cit> . clp proteases in bacterial and eukaryotic systems have been implicated in vital cellular processes such as sporulation, dna replication, protein turnover, stress tolerance and acclimation and regulation of gene expression  <cit> . clpb is different from clpa, clpx and hslu as it does not associate with peptidase subunits. the function of clpb is also distinct from that of other clp atpases: this protein is not involved in protein degradation  <cit> , instead it disaggregates and reactivates strongly aggregated proteins  <cit> . the aggregation reversing activity of clpb requires cooperation with the hsp70/hsp <dig> chaperone machinery  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, clpb proteins have been divided into  <dig> classes according to cytoplasmic, chloroplastic and mitochondrial isoforms. cytoplasmic clpb is constituted by at1g <dig>  chloroplastic clpb by at5g <dig> and mitochondrial clpb by at2g <dig>  <cit> . much of the work on clpb proteins has been carried out on atclpb-cyt isoform  <cit> . we isolated and sequenced rice clpb-cyt gene  and showed that rice clpb-cyt cdna complements yeast hsp <dig> deletion and loss of thermotolerance trait in yeast  <cit> . genetic analysis has shown that clpb-cyt protein is essential for heat tolerance in plants. mutants of zea mays and a. thaliana plants under-expressing their respective clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> proteins are observed to lack both basal as well as induced thermotolerance  <cit> . queitsch et al  <cit>  produced transgenic a. thaliana plants by modifying level of atclpb-cyt/hsp <dig> protein. transgenic plants in the latter study survived as high as 45°c  temperature stress as they showed vigorous growth after the removal of stress. katiyar-agarwal et al  <cit>  over-expressed atclpb-cyt/hsp <dig> protein in rice plants. the transgenic rice lines showed re-growth in the post-high temperature stress recovery phase while the untransformed plants could not recover to the similar extents. keeler et al  <cit>  reported cloning of a chloroplastic hsp100/clpb gene from phaseolus lunatus. the corresponding protein was seen to be localized to chloroplast. the accumulation of clpb/hsp <dig> in this plant species was tightly correlated with heat acclimation, suggesting that the chloroplastic clpb/hsp <dig> may be an important protein for acquiring thermotolerance. chloroplastic clpb from lycopersicon esculentum has been shown to be important in acquired thermotolerance  <cit> . antisense suppression of lehsp100/clpb in tomato plants made the plants more heat sensitive. lee et al  <cit>  noted that arabidopsis knockout clpb-p plants turn yellow on heat treatment. clpb-p mutant plants showed a distinct change in chloroplast morphology upon subjecting plants to high temperature stress: chloroplasts were irregular to roundish in shape and were  <dig> % of the size of normal chloroplasts. lee et al  <cit>  reported that at2g <dig>  was localized to mitochondria based on experiments in which transgenic arabidopsis plants produced with signal peptide of at2g <dig> fused with gfp showed expression of the reporter gene in mitochondria. this group further noted that the clpb-m transcript was up-regulated during heat shock and the level of induced transcript for clpb-m was lower as compared to athsp <dig> and clpb-p transcripts. clpb-m knockout arabidopsis plants grew in comparable way to the wild type plants both during induced and acquired thermotolerance.

plant clpc proteins, which are the homolog of the e. coli clpa proteins, have been noted in chloroplast stroma of several plant species  <cit> . clpcs are considered to be highly conserved proteins among different species  <cit> . clpc of bacillus subtilis has been found not only to be involved in the removal of misfolded and aggregated proteins but also controls through regulated proteolysis, several key steps of development  <cit> . two nearly-identical clpc isomers exist in arabidopsis. clpc has been seen to be associated with clpp in the stroma  <cit>  in an atp dependent manner  <cit> . sjogren et al  <cit>  reported that clpc <dig> mutant arabidopsis plants display a retarded growth phenotype and leaves with a homogeneous chlorotic appearance. this mutant also exhibited fewer photosystem i and photosystem ii complexes. clpc in synechococcus elongatus has been noted to possess atpase activity as well as function as a molecular chaperone without the need of additional chaperones or adaptor proteins  <cit> . it is suggested that clpc functions in part as a housekeeping chaperone in vivo, protecting unfolded, newly synthesized  polypeptides from aggregation. clpd proteins differ from clpcs by specific signature sequence and by its differential expression characteristics  <cit> . clpd in arabidopsis has previously been referred to as erd <dig>  <cit>  and sag <dig>  <cit> . weaver et al  <cit>  reported that the erd <dig> protein declines while its mrna increases during senescence in arabidopsis.

it is hence clear that plant clps are associated with stress and developmental processes. the comprehensive analysis of rice clp atpases with respect to their structural and functional aspects has not been addressed to as yet. this study provides information on rice class i clp atpases with respect to genomic organization, regulation, protein architecture and cellular functions.

RESULTS
genome complexity of rice class i clp atpase members
the protein sequence of rice clpb/hsp <dig>  was noted to be same as the protein encoded by the msu locus os05g <dig>  os05g <dig> was used as a query for identifying the other clp homologs at the msu rice database. nine orfs encoded by os02g <dig>  os02g <dig>  os02g <dig>  os03g <dig>  os04g <dig>  os04g <dig>  os11g <dig>  os11g <dig> and os12g <dig> loci were noted to share homology to os05g <dig> in this analysis . search using hsp <dig> as a key word showed that os08g <dig> is also one of the probable candidate genes belonging to clp atpase family. however, alignment of protein sequence of os08g <dig> with os05g <dig> showed that os08g <dig> does not contain most of the domains which are typically present in clp proteins . therefore, os08g <dig> is not included as clp atpase family member herein. further, os02g <dig> locus encoding for a mitochondrial 74kda protein  showed high similarity to yeast hsp <dig> protein. though os02g <dig> protein appeared to be the closest homologue of os05g <dig> protein in terms of sequence similarity , os02g <dig> lacked the n-terminal domain which other mitochondrial hsp <dig> proteins possess. importantly, os02g <dig> locus appears not to be expressed in rice based on microarray as well as quantitative-pcr  analysis while the yeast hsp <dig> protein is strongly expressed in response to high temperature stress. we have therefore omitted os02g <dig> gene as well from the class i clp atpase family in further discussion. overall then, we assume that  <dig> orfs  constitute rice class i clp atpases.

phylogenetic relationship among plant class i clp atpases
phylogenetic analysis of rice class i clp atpases with the corresponding arabidopsis proteins  enabled us to annotate and classify the above  <dig> rice orfs into clpb, c and d classes as follows:  <dig> clpb proteins ,  <dig> clpc proteins  and  <dig> clpd proteins . the extent of identity of these proteins with respect to os05g <dig> is as follows: os02g08490- <dig> %, os02g32520- <dig> %, os03g31300- <dig> %, os04g32560-40%, os04g33210- <dig> %, os11g16590- <dig> %, os11g16770- <dig> % and os12g12580- <dig> %. populus trichocarpa is the first tree species whose genome has been sequenced. a blastp search of populus genome at http://genome.jgi-psf.org/poptr1_1/ revealed that it has  <dig> homologs to rice os05g <dig>  clp atpases from populus have been named in this text as per the system described by waters et al  <cit>  for lmw hsps. molecular details for the  <dig> populus clp atpases are shown in additional file  <dig>  overall, we find that populus genome contains  <dig> clpb ,  <dig> clpc  and  <dig> clpd  genes. arabidopsis-rice-populus phylogenetic tree was constructed using amino acid sequences of  <dig> clp atpase proteins from rice ,  <dig> from arabidopsis  and  <dig> from populus . the tree divided all  <dig> proteins into  <dig> major clades corresponding to clpb, clpc and clpd proteins. clpb clade was divided into  <dig> subclades according to cytoplasmic, chloroplastic and mitochondrial isoforms. cytoplasmic clpb are os05g <dig>  at1g <dig> and pt <dig> ; chloroplastic clpb are os03g <dig>  at5g <dig>  pt <dig>  and pt <dig>  and mitochondrial clpb are os02g <dig>  at2g <dig> and pt <dig> . at the amino acid level, os02g <dig> is  <dig> % similar to at2g <dig> which has recently been reclassified from atclpb <dig> to atclpb-m  <cit> . os03g <dig> showed high similarity  with at5g <dig>  os05g <dig> has a similarity of  <dig> % with at1g <dig> at the amino acid level. clpc clade contained  <dig> rice ,  <dig> arabidopsis  and  <dig> populus  members. at the amino acid level, os04g <dig>  shows homology of  <dig>  and  <dig> % with at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  respectively. os12g <dig>  shares  <dig> % similarity with os04g <dig>  the sequence being dissimilar only in the region towards n-terminus which corresponds to the signal peptide. os12g <dig> shows 83% and  <dig> % identity at the amino acid levels with at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  respectively. pt <dig>  and pt <dig>  showed similarity in the range of 84-86% to os04g <dig> and os12g <dig>  suggesting that clpc atpases are highly conserved across phyla. os11g <dig> and os11g <dig> also appear to be members of clpc clade. clpd class included two proteins from rice , one from arabidopsis  and two from populus . os02g <dig> has identity of  <dig> % with at5g <dig> which was previously identified as erd <dig> protein and later rechristened as atclpd  <cit> . os04g <dig> shows 60% sequence identity to at5g <dig> at the amino acid level. pt <dig>  and pt <dig>  showed similarity ranging from 61-65% at the amino acid level with their rice counterparts. table  <dig> provides detailed properties of rice class i clp atpase genes.

genomic organization of rice class i clp atpase genes
rice class i clp atpase genes appear to be distributed in the genome . there is no duplication event seen in these genes, suggesting that these genes have evolved independently from each other and there is no transposition involved. however, the evolutionary patterns of organellar and cytoplasmic isoforms of various class i clp atpases remain to be analyzed. further, there is not much similarity among these genes at the level of distribution of exon and intron sequences: all class i clp atpase genes contained introns and there was no specific pattern in the arrangement of exons and introns in their genomic loci . osclpb-c has  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns which accounts for the most in any clp member in rice class i atpase gene family. osclpb-cyt appears the smallest gene among rice class i clp atpase genes with respect to the genic region occupied. with respect to the proposed orf of osclpc <dig> gene, a discrepancy was noted: kome database shows ak <dig> to contain orf of  <dig>  kb while msu database predicts orf of  <dig>  kb. while  <dig>  kb orf seems to encode the complete protein , there are no databank entries corresponding to  <dig>  kb transcript of this gene. kome clone in fact contains the last  <dig>  kb region of the  <dig>  kb clone. in this study, full length osclpc <dig> was cloned from control unstressed rice seedling tissues using rt-pcr. since a band corresponding to ~  <dig>  kb on 1% agarose gel in this reaction was noted , it is thus indicated that osclpc <dig> orf is ~  <dig>  kb under the conditions examined herein.

domain structure of class i osclp atpase proteins
smart and pfam database were analyzed for retrieving information on various domains present in rice class i clp atpase proteins. in osclpb-cyt, nbd <dig> and nbd <dig> span amino acids 209- <dig> and 607- <dig>  respectively . osclpb-cyt also contains a spacer region which spans 494- <dig> amino acids; this spacer is characteristic of clpb proteins. m-domain overlaps with spacer signature ii. the signal peptides were predicted using predotar and loctree programs. os02g <dig> was predicted to be mitochondrial , while os03g <dig> was predicted to be chloroplastic . although osclpb-cyt is considered to be cytoplasmic, its amino acid sequence analyzed at loctree program predicts that this protein is nuclear-localized and contains a putative nuclear localization signal  present from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig> . the architecture and the physical position of various domains in clpc and clpd proteins are shown in figure  <dig>  it is amply clear from this analysis that rice clp c and d proteins belong to class i atpases, containing two nbds . all the class i clp atpase proteins except osclpc <dig> were seen to contain two copies of clpn domain . this domain present towards the n-termini is speculated to have a role in protein binding. clpc <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and d <dig> proteins contained  <dig> amino acids long uvr domain between the two nbds. uvr domains have been seen in proteins which have role in dna recognition, repair and processing. the proteins containing uvr domain are reportedly able to interact with each other through this domain. osclpc <dig> and osclpc <dig> are predicted to be chloroplast-localized. on the other hand, clpc <dig> is predicted to be mitochondrial/chloroplastic with equal probability and osclpc <dig> is predicted to be present in plasma membrane. all the clpc proteins identified to date in arabidopsis and populus are localized in the chloroplast where they interact with the chloroplastic protease clpp.

furthermore, 3-dimensional structures of osclpbs were predicted using i-tasser  <cit> . of the various models suggested, structures which had a higher c-score were taken . importantly, osclpb-c, osclpb-m and osclpb-cyt showed almost similar structural arrangements as has been seen in case of a. thaliana clpb . the coiled-coil linker formed the central portion of the structures and the two nbds flanked it. the predicted binding sites also showed the same pattern in the three clpb isoforms . from the structures proposed, it is suggested that osclpb-c, osclpb-m and osclpb-cyt proteins are remarkably conserved with respect to their predicted protein binding sites.

in e. coli, complex formation between clpa and clpx with clpp is mediated by a helix-loop-helix motif in which the tip of the loop contains an essential igf/l tripeptide  <cit> . in case of rice clp atpase proteins, it was seen that except osclpb-m, osclpb-c and osclpb-cyt , all other clp class i atpase proteins contain this tripeptide igf/l motif . this motif was in general present towards the c-terminus except in case of osclpc <dig> which had the tripeptide at its n-terminus.

expression of rice class i clp atpase genes
microarray data at genevestigator database  were used for analyzing the transcript expression profiles of rice class i clp atpases in different tissues/developmental stages . in different developmental stages, the highest variation was found in expression of osclpb-cyt: this gene showed minimal expression during germination, seedling, heading and flowering stages but showed high expression at milk and dough stages . on the other hand, there was a gradual increase in the expression of osclpb-c transcript from germination to milk stage and the expression declined during dough stage . for expression of rice class i clp atpase genes in response to stresses, microarray profiling was carried out for analyzing expression during cold , heat  and oxidative stress  conditions. clpb genes showed a notably enhanced expression during heat stress . osclpb-cyt showed enhanced expression during oxidative stress also although the magnitude of expression under oxidative stress was less as compared to heat stress. osclpb-c and osclpb-m showed almost identical response to the stresses . transcript expression for clpb genes with q-pcr matched with microarray data. while all three clpb genes showed up-regulation under heat stress, the magnitude of the expression levels varied for the three genes . low levels of osclpb-m and osclpb-c transcripts were noted under unstressed conditions too. osclpb-cyt transcript was strictly induced in response to heat stress . the transcript abundance during heat shock was highest for osclpb-m and lowest for osclpb-c among the three clpb atpase genes. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed distinct heat shock inducibility in all three clpb genes . osclpb-cyt was mainly heat shock inducible. this transcript also showed a somewhat low expression in response to cold stress. all three clpb transcripts were noted to be induced in response to exogenous aba application to a comparable extent in shoot and root tissues of rice seedlings . expression of osclpb-cyt was found to be much higher than other clpb isoforms in dry seeds of rice, based on real-time pcr analysis .

osclpc <dig> appeared to be transcriptionally silent in microarray at genevestigator. osclpc <dig> showed maximum expression among the various clpc genes. levels of osclpc <dig> transcript did not show much variation in expression; these transcripts were minimally expressed in endosperm. in general, there was almost similar expression profiles of osclpd <dig> and osclpd <dig> genes although there was variation in the magnitude of expression. osclpd <dig> was seen to be expressed in anther and ovary but not in seed tissues . heat and oxidative stress inducibility was also relatively higher for osclpc <dig> and osclpd <dig> genes . in the other clp atpases, only significant change marked was for low temperature inducibility of osclpd <dig> . although microarray data showed that osclpc <dig> was heat stress regulated, we did not find the same in semi-quantitative rt-pcr.

localization of osclpb-c and osclpb-m proteins
in silico analyses shown in table  <dig> predicted osclpb-c and osclpb-m proteins to be present in chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively. to confirm their localizations, we designed two constructs namely atclpb-m-cfp-1881-osclpb-m-gfp and atclpb-c-cfp-1881-osclpb-c in this study. in atclpb-m-cfp-1881-osclpb-m-gfp construct,  <dig> amino acid long signal sequence  from atclpb-m were fused with cfp and used as a positive control and signal sequence from osclpb-m in fusion with gfp expression as a test system; expression was driven by using a bidirectional promoter from a pair of rice protease inhibitor genes, for both the reporter proteins. similar strategy was employed in construction of atclpb-c-cfp-1881-osclpb-c plasmid. in this case,  <dig> amino acids long signal peptide  were fused to cfp and used as a positive control. both plasmids were shot separately for transient transformation of onion epidermal cells. the fluorescence emitting from gfp and cfp proteins in both the constructs co-localized . this suggests that osclpb-m is localized to the same sub-cellular compartment as does the atclpb-m. likewise, osclpb-c is localized to the same sub-cellular compartment as does the atclpb-c.

complementation of s. cerevisiae Δhsp <dig> mutant by rice class i clp atpase proteins
deletion of hsp <dig> gene in yeast  leads to thermosensitivity as the mutant cells are not able to survive heat shock . possible effect of different rice class i clp atpases in complementation of Δhsp <dig> mutant yeast cells was next analyzed. different class i clp atpases were cloned in pgv <dig> vector under the control of gpd constitutive promoter to yield constructs pgv8-osclpb-cyt, pgv8-osclpb-c, pgv8-osclpb-m, pgv8-osclpc <dig>  pgv8-osclpc <dig> and pgv8-osclpd <dig> . plasmid dna containing different class i clp atpases were linearized and transformed into scΔhsp <dig> cells and selected on a medium lacking uracil to yield scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpb-cyt, scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpb-c, scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpb-m, scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpc <dig>  scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpc <dig> and scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpd <dig> cell types. scΔhsp <dig> cells transformed with athsp <dig>  and schsp <dig>  were used as positive control while scΔhsp <dig> cells transformed with vector  were used as negative control. thermotolerance assay was carried out by giving a pre-treatment of  <dig> min at 37°c and then exposing cells to heat shock for  <dig> min at 50°c. control and heat stressed cells were dotted on ypad plates to a dilution of 10- <dig> and kept at 28°c for  <dig> h and photographed . we noted that positive control scΔhsp104-schsp <dig> grew better than scΔhsp <dig> and scΔhsp104-vector yeast cells. positive effect was also seen in scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpb-cyt, scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpb-m, scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpc <dig> and scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpd <dig> cell types. remarkably, scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpd <dig> cells grew even better than scΔhsp104-schsp <dig> cells.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we show in this study that rice genome has  <dig> entries  for the class i clp atpase protein family. in arabidopsis, there are  <dig> class i clp atpase genes which specify  <dig> clpb proteins ,  <dig> clpc proteins  and  <dig> clpd protein   <cit> . from the comparative details, it appears that  <dig> rice loci specify  <dig> clpb ,  <dig> clpc  and  <dig> clpd . phylogenetic analysis using rice, populus and arabidopsis sequences showed that class i clp atpase sequences are significantly conserved. the tree showed three major clades, one each corresponding to clpb, clpc and clpd proteins . clpb proteins were further categorized into cytoplasmic, chloroplastic and mitochondrial isoforms based on targetp, predotar, loctree and psort database. cytoplasmic clpb members included osclpb-cyt, at1g <dig> and pt <dig> ; chloroplastic clpb included osclpb-c, at5g <dig>  pt <dig>  and pt <dig>  and mitochondrial clpb included osclpb-m, at2g <dig> and pt <dig> . although osclpc <dig> and osclpc <dig> are considered members of clpc class, these proteins appear somewhat different from osclpc <dig> and osclpc <dig> proteins. all clpc proteins identified to date are localized to the chloroplast where they interact with the chloroplastic protease clpp. from the in silico analysis, it appears that clpc <dig> on the other hand may be chloroplast/mitochondria localized while clpc <dig> is membrane bound protein. recently, aaa+ atpase chaperone coxd protein in oligotropha carboxidovorans is found to be present exclusively in cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . a clp atpase in glycine max has also been found to be membrane associated  <cit> . high temperature causes modifications in membrane functions, associated with alteration of membrane fluidity. in plant cells, membrane-based processes such as photosynthesis and respiration are especially important. vigh et al  <cit>  proposed that any alterations in the plasma membrane microdomains are well suited for sensing stress and re-tailoring the expression of various classes of hsps. the chances of interaction of membrane-associated hsps with the proteins involved in signaling increases as these molecules are also concentrated in the membrane rafts. clpc <dig> protein of rice may have such an implication.

importantly, osclpc <dig> contained  <dig> nucleotides long intron in the 5'utr and further harbored five upstream orfs  in the 5'utr. the role of these uorfs in regulation, if any, needs to be worked out. both osclpd <dig> and osclpd <dig> genes towards their 5' ends showed a sterile alpha motif  domain containing protein : msu rice gene model predicts that osclpd <dig> and os02g <dig> gene pair and osclpd <dig> and os04g <dig> gene pair may give rise to natural sense/antisense transcripts . further analysis of in vivo regulation of clpd proteins may reflect the significance of this observation. domain analysis showed that osclpb-cyt protein contains various motifs which are typical of hsp <dig> proteins. spacer signature ii motif seen in osclpb proteins was notably absent from osclpcs and osclpds . complex formation between clpa and clpx with clpp is reportedly mediated by a helix-loop-helix motif in which the tip of the loop contains an essential igf/l tripeptide . weibezahn et al  <cit>  engineered a clpb variant termed bap , which carried the p-element. association of clpp converted bap from a refolding into a degrading disaggregase, demonstrating that this engineering brings in threading of aggregated proteins into the proteolytic chamber of clpp. when rice class i clp atpase proteins were searched for the presence of igf motif, it was seen that apart from osclpb-m, osclpb-c and osclpb-cyt, all other proteins contained igf/l tripeptide motif . this observation may have an implication for differential function of clpb as compared to other class i clps. according to kim et al  <cit> , igf/l tripeptide consensus is generally located between the sensor i and box vii motifs. however, osclpc <dig> contained this motif towards the n-terminus. this may have some relation to the fact that unlike all other clps, osclpc <dig> is the only rice clp that appears to be associated with the plasma membrane.

cross-induction of hsp genes by diverse stresses is known  <cit> . zou et al  <cit>  have recently shown that the expression of nine different oshsp genes was affected differentially by heat, cold, salt, desiccation as well as aba. hu et al  <cit>  noted an extensive overlap of transcript levels in rice hsfs and hsps in response to different stresses. likewise, mittal et al  <cit>  noted cross-induction of hsf transcripts by diverse stresses in rice seedlings. on the same line, clpatpase genes showed stress-related transcript expression. agarwal et al  <cit>  reported that osclpb-cyt/hsp <dig> transcript in rice seedlings is induced strongly by heat and this transcript remains unaffected in response to salt stress, water stress, low temperature stress and aba application. hu et al  <cit>  noted that osclpb-cyt was regulated by heat shock as well as drought. in this study, microarray analysis showed that osclpb-cyt transcript was up-regulated more than 5-folds both during heat stress as well as oxidative stress. osclpb-cyt transcript was induced after low temperature stress . this study is the first report for the cold induction of osclpb-cyt, though at low levels. wu et al  <cit>  reported that rice hsp <dig> promoter responds to desiccation stress. in the experimental conditions used in the current study , we failed to note induction of osclpb-cyt transcript in response to desiccation stress. osclpb-c was up-regulated during heat stress by up to 5-folds and during oxidative stress by up to  <dig>  folds based on microarray analysis . q-pcr data showed that as with osclpb-cyt, the relative abundance of osclpb-c transcripts was far more responsive during heat stress as compared to oxidative stress. osclpb-m gene, like its counterpart gene in arabidopsis, was found to be heat and oxidative stress up-regulated . q-pcr data showed that transcript abundance of osclpb-m was highest during heat stress among the three osclpb genes. on the other hand, atclpb-m showed lowest transcript abundance among its different clpb isoforms  <cit> . in a study on transcriptional profiling of genes responsive to hormonal treatments in rice, hsp <dig> transcript was found to be specifically induced in response to aba  <cit> . we observe that transcriptionally, osclpb-m and osclpb-c respond more to aba than osclpb-cyt .

osclpc <dig> transcripts did not undergo any change under stress conditions while osclpc <dig> was seen to be up-regulated  under heat, cold and oxidative stress conditions as seen in microarray experiment although we did not find the same upregulation in semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis . no amplicons were detected for osclpc <dig> and osclpc <dig> in the semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis. this may indicate that these loci may in fact be transcriptionally silent under the conditions tested. however, in silico analysis of publicly-available microarray database shows osclpc <dig> expression in stem, culm and leaf tissues . evidence for expression of osclpc <dig> is yet awaited. shen et al  <cit>  reported that osclpd <dig> is induced by water deficit and temperature stress in vegetative tissues. we observed that this gene was up-regulated by different stresses. in microarray data, osclpd <dig> showed down-regulation during heat and oxidative stresses and a marginal up-regulation in cold stress .

atclpb-m and atclpb-c have been shown to be localized to mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively  <cit> . we found that osclpb-m is localized to the same location in the cell as atclpb-m. likewise, we noted that osclpb-c is localized to the same location as atclpb-c. we thus show that osclpb-m and osclpb-c are localized to mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively . it therefore, appears that these proteins may have specific functions in cellular organelles.

yeast expressing hsp <dig> are typically 100- to 1000-fold more thermotolerant than yeast lacking hsp <dig>  thus demonstrating the critical requirement for this protein in cell survival during extreme heat stress  <cit> . arabidopsis clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> has been shown to overcome the temperature sensitivity of yeast Δhsp <dig> mutant  <cit> . similar observations were noted for the clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> proteins from soybean  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . this fact prompted us to analyze ability of diverse class i clp genes in yeast mutant complementation assay. osclpb-cyt showed reasonably good complementation ability. the capability of osclpb-m appeared comparable to osclpb-cyt in conferring tolerance. our observation actually matches to an earlier experiment done with yeast  <cit> . this group expressed yeast hsp <dig> protein which is mitochondrial isoform of the yeast cytoplasmic hsp <dig> protein, in the cytoplasm of the hsp <dig> mutant yeast cells. they noted that yeast hsp <dig> protein complements the cytoplasmic hsp <dig> yeast mutation. this experiment indicates that the organellar and the cytoplasmic clpbs may have some degree of redundancy in their substrate recognition. further, the target substrate proteins of different clps are not yet defined. in due course when target proteins are established, it should be possible to address the question of mitochondrial clpb complementing the cytoplasmic yeast hsp <dig> mutation more deeply. a significant observation in this assay test was the fact that osclpd <dig> restores the mutation defect of the scΔhsp <dig> yeast cells to a significant extent; scΔhsp104-pgv8-osclpd <dig> showed growth comparable to that of the scΔhsp104-schsp <dig> yeast cells. clpd expression in arabidopsis has previously been seen to be associated during senescence  <cit>  but there is no study that links expression of this gene to heat stress. the detailed mechanism behind this role of osclpd <dig> remains to be worked out. it should be relevant to analyze how osclpd <dig> expression alters transcript profiling in Δhsp <dig> mutant yeast cells. it should also be relevant to generate transgenic plants with ectopically higher clpd <dig> protein and analyze their stress phenotype. weibezahn et al  <cit>  found that the development of thermotolerance in e. coli relies on the clpb/kje-mediated reactivation of aggregated proteins, whereas the removal of protein aggregates by degradation does not confer thermotolerance. similarly in yeast, tessarz et al  <cit>  noted that the degradation of aggregated proteins results in loss of thermotolerance. they reported that the removal of aggregated proteins by hap and clpp is not sufficient for yeast cells to survive a severe heat shock, but survival demands on the reactivation of aggregated proteins. it can thus be inferred that disaggregation and reactivation of proteins is essential for cell survival after extreme heat stress, whereas the degradation of aggregated proteins is insufficient. it is possible that expression of osclpd <dig> does this activity more efficiently than other class i clps and hence its expression results in more thermotolerance than noted for other rice class i clp proteins. finally, it needs to be mentioned that although different clp atpases are noted to complement yeast hsp <dig> mutation in this study, it is possible that variations in expression levels of rice clps in yeast which have not been determined, may also affect complementation efficiencies.

finally, we wish to herein draw a comparable picture of arabidopsis and rice class i clp atpases. there are some major differences in these two species for the number of clpb, clpcs and clpds nuclear genes. while arabidopsis has  <dig> and  <dig> clpc and clpd members, respectively, rice appears to contain  <dig> and  <dig> clpc and clpd members, respectively. on the other hand, number of clpb proteins appears same  in both rice and arabidopsis. both in rice and arabidopsis, one each of clpb type is present in cytoplasm, chloroplasts and mitochondria. it should be relevant to extend the above observations further to analyze what implications these might have in regulating heat response in these two contrasting plant species.
