BACKGROUND
during sexual reproduction meiosis insures that progeny receive half their genetic information from each parent, thus maintaining the correct ploidy from generation to generation. many genes essential for meiosis are highly conserved in fungi, invertebrates, mammals, and plants. on the contrary, mechanisms governing the initiation of meiosis are diverse  <cit> . unlike animals, plants lack a germ line pre-determined early in development. therefore, understanding the molecular changes that specify the archesporial cells, the progenitors of meiotic cells, is crucial in defining the network of cellular processes leading to a successful switch from mitosis to meiosis.

flowering is a late step in plant development, and nearly all floral cells are somatic. mutants defective in the reproductive cells often have no or few defects in the soma and vice versa; once specified, the pre-meiotic cells can proliferate mitotically and then differentiate for meiosis successfully even when the surrounding somatic tissue is abnormal  <cit> . in angiosperms meiotic cells originate from a handful of pluripotent somatic cells, derived from the l <dig> layer  of a floral meristem. in maize , a few archesporial cells - the precursors of meiotically competent pmcs - are cytologically distinguishable by their central locular location and rapid enlargement when there are approximately  <dig> l2-d cells in locules of 150- <dig> μm anthers  <cit>  . archesporial cells proliferate mitotically for several days  then pause for  <dig> days as they mature into pmcs and functional meiocytes; concomitantly, the maize anthers grow from  <dig> mm to  <dig>  mm . l2-d cells that do not differentiate as archesporial cells form  <dig> somatic layers, each of a single cell type, that encircle the pre-meiotic population . it is presently unclear how l2-d cells are programmed to be pre-meiotic within anthers or how this identity is retained during the mitotic divisions prior to pmc maturation. by  <dig>  mm, prophase i has started and completion of meiosis depends on the correct expression of many genes  <cit> . although archesporial cell divisions are asynchronous, maize meiosis is highly synchronized, likely facilitated by plasmodesmatal  connections among the pmcs.

our focus is to understand the maturation of pmcs present in  <dig>  mm anthers into meiocytes, that is, what processes are required for the cessation of mitosis, acquisition of meiotic competence, and initiation of meiosis? many genes have been identified in flowering plants that are required for normal anther differentiation, but we are interested in defining the steps leading towards meiosis once the normal population of somatic and pmc cells are present. several lines of evidence indicate that meiosis is set up as early as the pre-meiotic interphase  <cit> , during the three day period of pmc maturation in maize anthers. additionally, there may be differentiation steps preceding this stage that are not visualized cytologically.

our entry point into analyzing meiotic competence is am1; this is a maize nuclear protein required for normal pmc maturation  <cit> , and it is necessary for both meiotic initiation and progression through early prophase i  <cit> . the actual roles of am <dig> in the progression of meiosis at either the premeiotic/meiotic or the l/z transition are still unclear at the molecular level. the closest homologs to am <dig> are osam <dig> in rice  <cit>  and swi1/dyad in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , but this gene is absent from both fungal and animal genomes. an analysis of double mutant combinations showed that am <dig> is epistatic to many meiotic genes responsible for homologous chromosome pairing, including afd <dig>  dv <dig>  ms <dig>  and ms <dig>  <cit> ; additional meiotic processes impacted in am <dig> mutants include regulation of sister chromatid cohesion, telomere bouquet formation, recombination, synapsis, microtubule organization, and expression of other meiotic genes, particularly those acting during early prophase i  <cit> .

multiple am <dig> alleles have been distinguished cytologically  <cit> , and all homozygotes are male-sterile. in all but one allelic state , central locular cells with pmc cellular anatomy undergo mitosis rather than meiosis. for example, the am1- <dig> allele contains a mu insertion in an exon near the 3'-end; although the allele is transcribed, no protein is detected in mutant anthers  <cit> . the am1-prai allele encodes a semi-functional protein with a single amino acid substitution ; the protein supports meiotic entry but pmcs fail to progress normally. in fertile maize, am <dig> is expressed pre-meiotically and later loaded onto chromosomes during early prophase i; the defective am1-prai protein remained mainly dispersed in nuclei and meiosis stalls at the l/z transition  <cit> . the l/z transition is a major step in meiotic progression during which pairing of homologous chromosomes is initiated as telomeres cluster on the nuclear envelope and double strand breaks are made as homologous recombination proceeds  <cit> . the am1-prai allele demonstrates that the l/z transition is tightly regulated in plants, and it allows us to analyze this critical meiotic step in maize. the precise phenotypes of mutants are species-specific, but in each case am <dig> and its homologs play a role in the regulation of early meiotic events. osam <dig> from rice  <cit>  has a similar domain organization as maize, however, the swi1/dyad protein of arabidopsis lacks n- and c-terminal domains found in am <dig> and shares only 31% similarity in the central conserved phd finger domain  <cit> . an rnai inhibition of osam <dig> results in meiocytes that reach leptotene, similar to the maize am1-prai mutant  <cit> . aberrant swi1/dyad <dig> proteins in arabidopsis affect chromosome structure and cohesion during meiosis to various extents in both anthers and ovules  <cit>  likely through meiotic chromosome remodeling  <cit> . the sister chromatids segregate unevenly during meiosis in swi1-1/dyad anthers, while in the ovule, meiosis is replaced by mitosis. arabidopsis with specific swi1/dyad <dig> alleles show a small proportion of unreduced diploid gametes indicative of a meiotic or post-meiotic failure. this phenotype represents the first step  to generate apomictic progeny, a novel prospect in plant breeding in which the progeny genotype is identical to the parent  or identical to a single meiotic product  <cit> .

to better understand the required steps that normally occur during pmc maturation in preparation for meiosis and for progression through the critical l/z transition, we compared the anther transcriptomes of mitotic am1- <dig> and l/z meiotic arrest am1-prai lines using a custom agilent  <dig> ×  <dig> k microarray. although am <dig> mutants affect both male and female meiosis, anthers were chosen because they are much easier to dissect than the female floral tissue and because comprehensive transcriptome studies of normal maize anther development are already available on this array platform  <cit> .

RESULTS
development and morphology of am <dig> mutant tassels
to identify stages of anther development in fertile and male-sterile siblings relevant for this study, developmental progression was carefully followed for the two backgrounds harboring the am1-prai and am1- <dig> alleles. the male inflorescence  on a fertile maize plant bears hundreds of spikelets as shown in figures 1d and 1f. when tassels reach maturity, the side branches held upright along the main spike relax to a lateral position, and pollen is shed from exerted anthers. the external morphology of am1-prai tassels  is highly similar to a fertile sibling  with the same number of tassel branches . in contrast, am1- <dig> tassels  have fewer side branches  than their fertile siblings . delayed tassel development in am1- <dig> plants was also observed, because tassel branches remained upright about 5- <dig> days longer than in fertile siblings; tassels on am1-prai plants switched from upright to lateral simultaneously with fertile siblings.

each spikelet contains two florets; each floret contains  <dig> anthers  and each anther contains  <dig> locules. the upper floret is generally advanced  <dig> day relative to the lower floret. in our array experiment, only anthers from the upper florets were collected, and all measurements refer to this floret. many male sterile mutants of maize with pre-meiotic defects exhibit delayed tassel maturation and anther growth arrest at about  <dig> mm , that is, a failure to sustain anther growth during the three week period that follows completion of meiosis in fertile plants. male sterile am1-prai anthers continue to grow and reach  <dig> to  <dig> mm in length  at approximately the same time as fertile siblings. this indicates that the somatic cell layers of the am1-prai mutant anthers can sustain growth despite meiotic arrest. sterile am1-prai anther locules are plump  until right before they degenerate . in contrast, am1- <dig> anthers arrest at about  <dig> mm, the locules collapse, and anthers degenerate early as is typical of most ameiotic <dig> and other pre-meiotic male sterile mutants  <cit> . we conclude that somatic anther growth beyond  <dig> mm requires the presence of functional pmcs. we hypothesize that somatic anther tissues in am1-prai anthers perceive cues such as meiotic entry by the pmcs but progression through prophase i is not required to maintain anther growth.

cytological staging
anthers were collected, fixed and later stained with acetocarmine to determine the cytological stage of pmcs in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm anthers . both the  <dig>  mm am1- <dig> and am1-prai pmcs were at pre-meiotic interphase at the  <dig>  mm stage  and cytologically normal. archesporial cells in fertile plants finish most if not all the pre-meiotic mitotic divisions just before the  <dig>  mm pmc stage, but the cells continue to expand in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm as they mature  <cit> . most pmcs of  <dig>  mm fertile anthers were at interphase, but a few had advanced to early leptotene . at  <dig>  mm, the fertile pmcs are definitely in meiosis and achieve zygotene synchronously , while the pmcs in am1- <dig> were found at various stages of mitosis  with twenty unsynapsed chromosomes . at  <dig>  mm am1- <dig> pmcs continued one or more rounds of mitosis  as previously reported  <cit> .

am1-prai pmcs are delayed in maturation and remained at interphase  at  <dig>  mm. eventually they start meiosis synchronously by the  <dig>  mm stage , about  <dig> h after the normal  <dig>  mm stage  or absent  as described in methods. maize anthers express an astonishing number of genes: the agilent  <dig> ×  <dig> k maize array has routinely detected expression of ~ <dig>  genes in both  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm anthers  <cit> . because the two am <dig> alleles examined here are in different genetic backgrounds  and maize inbred lines exhibit high levels of gene presence/absence and copy number variation  <cit>  we first investigated the congruence of anther transcriptomes between the fertile siblings in these two lines. the majority of the transcriptomes  are shared between the two fertile backgrounds . average variation of ~7% in gene content is reported for inbred lines  <cit> , and we conclude that many of the differences observed in the two backgrounds are attributable to maize diversity. to minimize background effects in the on/off analysis of gene expression, we have compared mutant anther transcriptomes directly to fertile siblings.

489: am1-489; pra: am1-prai; f: fertile; s: sterile. bold values are the common expressed sets in both  <dig> and pra backgrounds.

at  <dig>  mm am1- <dig> anthers are cytologically similar to fertile siblings; however, they are missing 2%  of the transcripts present in fertile siblings, which is above the estimated  <dig> % false discovery rate . additionally, 4%  are ectopically expressed compared to fertile siblings . these ectopically expressed genes include those that contribute to continued mitosis by the pmcs of am1- <dig> anthers. at  <dig>  mm am1-prai anthers are also similar to fertile cytologically, but there are ~10% fewer  transcript types and ectopic expression of  <dig> genes . some of these transcriptome differences at  <dig>  mm could reflect linkage disequilibrium  or phenotypes too subtle to visualize by microscopy. as is explicated below, the major contributor to the transcriptome difference in am1-prai is the developmental delay in this mutant.

pmcs in  <dig>  mm fertile anthers are at early prophase i between the leptotene and zygotene stages, somatic cells have differentiated, and somatic cell division has slowed. at  <dig>  mm the more severe am1- <dig> anthers are missing more than  <dig>  transcripts  expressed in fertile siblings . among these,  <dig>  are also expressed in both am1-prai mutant and fertile siblings, hence among the thousands of loss-of-expression cases should be genes involved in meiotic entry. in contrast, just over  <dig>  genes are off in am1-prai compared to fertile siblings . the transcriptome data support the cytological observation of delayed meiotic entry in am1-prai, because 80%  of the transcripts missing at  <dig>  mm are expressed by  <dig>  mm. a linkage tree of the global transcriptome including all  <dig> sample types also demonstrated the transcriptomes are most divergent between the two backgrounds while the transcriptome differences between mutant and fertile samples at  <dig>  mm are the least. in both backgrounds, the transcriptome of the mutant samples is more distinctive from fertile at  <dig>  mm than at  <dig>  mm . hence, it is important to exclude background difference before comparing the two alleles.

the lists of on/off genes were evaluated for the presence of known meiosis-associated genes, but none were found. thus although the am <dig> mutant alleles impact expression of ~10% of maize genes through ectopic expression and loss-of expression, these transcriptome differences must relate primarily to somatic cell processes. this demonstrates that meiotic genes are expressed in sterile am <dig> anthers but their expression levels could still be affected.

up- or down-regulated genes between stages or between alleles
in addition to on/off differences, we also evaluated transcript types that were expressed  and at least  <dig> -fold distinct from the comparator with a p-value <  <dig>  . to minimize false discovery resulting from background differences while comparing the two mutant anther types, only transcript types detected in both fertile backgrounds  were used in the evaluation of up- or down-regulated genes. both mutant anthers had about  <dig> times more genes differentially expressed at  <dig>  mm than at  <dig>  mm ; most transcripts are stage-specific confirming the distinctive properties of these two developmental stages  <cit> . the greater transcriptome abnormalities at  <dig>  mm parallel the more aberrant mutant phenotypes at this stage. a subset of these transcripts is likely essential for entry and progression through early meiosis. the am1- <dig> mutants had about twice as many genes up- or down-regulated than am1-prai at  <dig>  mm , confirming molecular consequences of the more severe phenotype of am1- <dig>  the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes unique to am1- <dig>  regardless of stage, are likely involved in meiotic entry or conversely highlight genes involved in the suppression of mitosis. the majority of these transcriptome differences  are found at  <dig>  mm, including six meiotic genes, i.e., mel <dig>  spo11- <dig>  osd1a, rpa <dig> , ps <dig>  and msh <dig> 

in addition to the numerous allele-specific, differentially regulated genes, there are a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes common to am1- <dig> and am1-prai at the  <dig>  mm stage . these include the non-redundant  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed in both  and  <dig> oppositely regulated transcripts . genes mis-regulated in both mutants at both stages  are good candidates for common transcriptome responses of am <dig> mutant anthers relating to progression through the l/z transition. the non-redundant set of  <dig> genes found at  <dig>  mm is of particular interest, because this is a critical point of meiotic progression. maize homologs of well known meiotic genes, e.g., skp1b, zip4/spo22-like, rad54-like, and meiosis-specific cyclins  <cit> , show transcriptional mis-regulation in the am <dig> mutants.

based on cytological evidence, development of pmcs in am1-prai is delayed then arrests while pmcs in am1- <dig> anthers undergo a mitotic division instead of a meiotic one. therefore, the transcriptome changes in am1- <dig> anthers compared to fertile at  <dig>  mm might also be important for meiotic entry. afd <dig> , and rpa <dig>  for example, are moderately down-regulated in am1- <dig> at  <dig>  mm but not down in am1-prai at  <dig>  mm. homolog of afd <dig> encodes protein associated with the cohesion complex, which establishes sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> , while rpa <dig> is implicated in replication, repair, and transcription  <cit> . we also noted an rna helicase sde <dig> in this group, known for its role in post-transcriptional gene silencing via rnai  <cit>  and shown to be associated with meiosis in worms, flies, and mammals  <cit> . a heat map of all the meiotic genes included on this array  is shown in additional file  <dig> 

our results indicate that am <dig> protein attenuates the expression level of many meiotic genes and other somatic genes that are crucial for anther maturation. anther development is delayed  and ultimately stalled, causing male sterility.

data validation
a pilot array experiment was conducted on the same array platform prior to the study reported here. anthers from families segregating for am1- <dig> and am1-prai were used in the pilot experiment and only male sterile anthers at  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm with  <dig> biological pools for each sample type were included. we compared data from the pilot experiment and found more than 90% of the pilot data corroborated results presented here .

to further validate quantification and classification of key transcripts, a panel of  <dig> meiosis-associated genes including am <dig> was analyzed by qrt . ten of them showed congruent results with the array data . the one exceptional transcript  was scored as borderline up-regulated  in am1- <dig> mutant versus fertile at  <dig>  mm on the array but was not significantly changed based on qrt results. notably we checked the expression level of am <dig> itself. the qrt analysis confirms the over-expression of the transcript in am1-prai in  <dig>  mm anthers observed in the microarray data. it is likely that the temporal arrest at the l/z stage and the inefficient loading of am1-prai onto the chromosomes, when am1-prai is highly expressed, lead to message accumulation in meiocytes. the increased transcript abundance is also reflected in at least  <dig> times higher levels of am1-prai protein in tassels containing  <dig> - <dig>  mm anthers than in wild type siblings at these stages .

√: qrt analyses found the same direction of regulation and approximately the same magnitude of change as calculated from the microarray analysis; nc: qrt and array results were non-congruent.

gene ontology  annotation of differentially regulated transcripts
go terms were assigned using agbase http://www.agbase.msstate.edu, where more than 50% of the probes have one or more terms assigned. figure  <dig> illustrates the classification of differential transcripts excluding the unknown category, which are included in the list of gene counts in additional file  <dig>  several functional groups are prominent. genes with catalytic activity and transporter activity are affected at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm in both am1- <dig> and am1-prai anthers. at the pre-meiotic  <dig>  mm stage, genes with hydrolase activity or nucleotide binding accounted for ~30% of the genes with known functions. these groups are likely critical in pmcs at interphase when cells are preparing for the cell cycle, including cell growth, dna replication, and organelle multiplication and for the proper differentiation of somatic anther cells. although no major cytological differences were observed between mutant and fertile anthers at this stage, many cell processes already appear to be compromised at the start of pmc maturation. genes with nucleic acid binding activity are likely essential for l/z transition. we conclude that a switch of cell processes programmed by new gene expression is necessary for subsequent meiotic entry and progression by the pmc and for normal development of somatic cell types.

am <dig> affects the transcriptomes of meiocytes and tapetum
based on cell counts, the pmcs constitute less than 1% of anther cells at the  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm stages in maize  <cit> . in transverse sectional area, however, these giant cells comprise 33% of the locule  and about 10% of the anther . using data in tang et al.  <dig>  <cit>  reporting the yield of total rna from isolated rice pmcs we calculate that rice pmcs contain at least  <dig> times more rna than a typical cell; similarly using data in chen et al.  <dig>  <cit> , arabidopsis pmcs must contain at least  <dig> times more rna than typical diploid cells. therefore in analyzing whole anthers, the expectation would be that  <dig> - 53% of extracted rna would be derived from the pmc population. as maize is more closely related to rice and anther size and morphology are also more similar, we take a figure of about 20% as the expected pmc contribution to total rna. based on these assumptions, transcripts enriched 4- <dig> fold in fertile anthers compared to either am <dig> mutant are likely to be pmc-enriched or pmc-specific transcripts.

nonetheless, a substantial fraction of the  <dig>  transcriptome changes documented in figure 3b  as specific to either am1- <dig> or am1-prai compared to their fertile counterparts could occur in somatic tissue surrounding the pre-meiotic cells. male-sterile mutants with tapetal defects are very common  because these nurse cells play critical roles in relaying nutrients and structural components to the pmcs. although not investigated to date, the absence of proper pmc maturation could readily impact neighboring tapetal cell differentiation over the  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm growth period as was hypothesized for the on/off class of transcripts. as a first step in assigning transcripts to the pre-germinal or somatic tissues, we cross checked against an independent array data set for laser-dissected pools of pmcs or tapetal cells from fertile anthers at  <dig>  mm . pmc-enriched genes were defined as those expressed at least  <dig> times higher in the pmcs than the surrounding tapetum; conversely, those expressed at least 2-fold higher in the tapetum compared to pmcs constitute the tapetum-enriched class. of the mis-regulated genes in whole anthers unique to either allele , 13%  were found in the pmc-enriched class; 10%  were in the tapetum-enriched class. considering each allele separately, of the  <dig>  non-redundant am1- <dig> specific changes, 10%  are in the pmc-enriched class and 12%  are tapetum-enriched. a different proportion is found in am1-prai: of the non-redundant am1-prai specific changes , 20%  are pmc-enriched and 7%  are tapetum-enriched. we conclude that am <dig> has a major impact on tapetal differentiation during pmc maturation, with a higher ratio of tapetal defects in am1- <dig> than in am1-prai; we hypothesize that the more substantial alterations in tapetal cells in am1- <dig> ultimately lead to under-developed, shorter am1- <dig> mutant anthers. we hypothesize that genes found in the combined list of pmc- and tapetal-enriched genes are likely to be important for normal growth of other anther cell types. for both am <dig> mutant alleles, this class comprises 75% of the mis-regulated genes indicating that mis-differentiation of the pmcs has a major impact on somatic anther cells.

among the  <dig> genes mis-regulated in both mutants,  <dig>  detected in whole anthers are in the pmc-enriched class while only 1% are expressed ~ <dig> times higher in tapetum. am <dig> protein was previously detected by immunolocalization only in meiocytes and not in the adjacent tapetal layer in fertile meiotic anthers  <cit> , and the ameiotic <dig> transcript intensities detected in the pmcs  are about 4- <dig> times higher than in the tapetum at  <dig>  mm. therefore, the absence of am <dig> or the presence of an aberrant protein has a major impact on pmc gene expression. sixty-four of the highly pmc-enriched genes are listed in table 3; at the criterion of  <dig> fold or higher in meiocytes than tapetum at  <dig>  mm many of these genes could be pmc-specific based on our estimate of the expected contribution of pmc rna to total anther rna. members include am <dig>  skp1b, ago <dig>  <cit> , and uba  genes.

these are genes affected in anthers with either mutant allele compared to fertile anthers at  <dig>  mm and are predominantly expressed  in pmcs than in tapetum at  <dig>  mm.

items in bold are known genes previously reported to be associated with meiosis or meiosis-related processes; nd: not determined.

maize homologs of well known meiotic genes show transcriptional mis-regulation in the am1-mutants : skp <dig>  an essential component of the ubiquitin-ligase complex involved in cohesion distribution and nuclear re-organization during leptotene to pachytene stage  <cit> ; rad <dig>  a rad <dig> partner involved in chromatin re-modeling and repair of dna double-strand breaks  <cit> ; msh <dig> and zip4/spo22-like, required genes for interferent crossing-over formation  <cit> ; and zyp <dig>  the central element of the synaptonemal complex that starts to assemble on chromosome at the l/z transition  <cit> . we also note the mis-expression of the meiotic cyclin sds essential for the control of meiotic prophase i progression in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> .

k-median clustering of pmc-enriched genes
the  <dig> pmc-enriched genes differentially expressed in both mutants  were clustered with algorithms from the cluster  <dig>  program http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/. k-median clustering based on euclidean distance, uncovered several interesting clusters, and these are displayed in a heat map . a group of  <dig> genes were up-regulated in am1-prai but down-regulated in am1- <dig> anthers compared to fertile at  <dig>  mm . a subset of these parallel am <dig> expression, including genes homologous to agamous-like mads-box transcription factor  <cit> , cell cycle associated mob1-like  <cit> , spx domain-containing, zinc finger -related, and suppressor of gene silencing  <dig>   <cit>  homolog . these genes could have high relevance for meiotic entry or suppression of mitosis. genes that have similar patterns in both am1- <dig> and am1-prai could be essential for meiotic prophase i progression. for instance,  <dig> genes are down-regulated in both mutants and cluster with skp1b and rad54-like . other clusters contain genes with defined meiosis-related functions include mmd <dig>  zyp <dig>  apospory, and werner syndrome atp-dependent helicase gene families  <cit> .

discussion
meiotically competent cells in plants differentiate late in floral ontogeny. presently, the steps required for specification of meiotic competence in a tiny number of floral somatic cells are unknown. however, nuclear events in meiotic cells are readily distinguishable from those in mitotic cells, and the developmental program of archesporial cells and pmcs is independent of successful somatic cell development at least through progression into prophase i  <cit> . the ameiotic <dig> mutants of maize demonstrate that conducting meiosis is distinguishable from the preceding pmc differentiation events such as cell and nuclear enlargement and a rounded cell shape. in all am <dig> mutant anthers, archesporial cells are normal and proliferate to make the normal numbers and morphology of highly enlarged pmcs present in  <dig>  mm maize anthers; somatic cell differentiation is also cytologically normal. for all am <dig> alleles except am1-prai, the pmcs remain mitotic rather than switching to meiosis, suggesting that both repression of mitosis and activation or maintenance of meiotic programs could be required to enter meiosis and that am <dig> contributes to these processes. cells in the somatic layers are still dividing at  <dig>  mm but most layers have stopped dividing by  <dig>  mm  <cit> ; the somatic cessation of mitosis does not require am <dig> 

global transcriptome analysis reinforces distinctions in the anatomical phenotypes of am1- <dig> and am1-prai. both mutants have few cytological and moderate transcriptome differences compared to fertile at  <dig>  mm. at  <dig>  mm fertile pmcs have entered meiosis while mutant pmcs have not; unsynchronized mitosis is observed in am1- <dig> pmcs, and these cells in am1-prai are still at the pre-meiotic interphase. the mutant transcriptomes are more distinctive compared to fertile anthers at  <dig>  mm. a comparison of the am1-prai profiles at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm confirms that these anthers are developmentally delayed at  <dig>  mm and that a substantial fraction of the transcriptome expected at  <dig>  mm appears later at  <dig>  mm. these results indicate that am <dig> has an early impact on the pace of pmc maturation that is critical for timely meiotic entry.

from profiling we discovered maize genes associated with meiotic entry and the l/z transition in pmcs using three methods: analysis of meiosis-associated genes, k-median clustering, and comparison to transcripts detected in isolated normal pmcs. many meiosis-associated transcript types identified in our transcriptome profiling study have been reported to play major roles in sister chromatid cohesion, synapsis, homologous recombination, and double-strand repair  <cit> . based on homology to defined proteins, a region shared between swi1/dyad <dig> and am <dig> is predicted to have dna binding ability like other phd finger homeodomain proteins  <cit>  and likely to be involved in regulating transcription. our array data clearly demonstrate that am <dig> attenuates the expression of other meiotic genes. interestingly, none of the meiosis-associated genes are regulated in an absolute on/off pattern, somewhat surprising given that am1- <dig> pmcs perform mitosis instead of meiosis. these results redefine a role of am <dig> in the modulation of transcript accumulation for many critical meiotic genes rather than simply switching them on or off. this could also imply that many meiotic genes including those associated with dna repair are expressed whether or not meiosis will proceed; this distinguishes plants from other well-studied eukaryotes.

one critical step to distinguish meiosis from mitosis is homologous chromosome pairing. only during meiosis are homologous chromosomes held together by the formation of the synaptonemal complex and remain attached until meiosis prophase i has completed by the formation of chiasmata, the cytological manifestation of crossovers. extensive studies have identified numerous genes involved in these processes after meiotic entry  <cit> , and several genes highlighted in comparing am <dig> to fertile are in this category . transcript types affected only in am1- <dig> include those with homology to afd <dig>  rpa <dig>  ms <dig>  and msh <dig> gene families. transcript differences found in both mutant anthers include those with homology to skp1b, rad54-like, msh <dig>  sds, and zyp <dig>  afd <dig>  a maize rec <dig> homolog acting downstream of asy1/hop <dig>  is associated with the maintenance of the axial/lateral elements of the synaptonemal complex and regulation of sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> . pawlowski et al.  <cit>  found that afd <dig> is loaded onto the chromatin in am1-prai but not in am1- <dig> pmcs. both the array and qrt data showed a moderate yet significant reduction of afd <dig> transcripts at  <dig>  mm in am1- <dig>  which is phenotypically similar to am1- <dig>  but not in am1-prai. dmc <dig>  a reca homolog, is involved in meiotic double strand dna break repair  <cit> . in plants dmc <dig> transcripts are found in pmcs and ovule meiotic cells  <cit>  and sporadically in mitotic cells  <cit> . the maize dmc <dig> homolog analyzed is down-regulated in am1- <dig> but not in am1-prai compared to fertile. thus the single amino acid mutation in the am1-prai protein does not impact the transcript levels of dmc <dig> or afd <dig> genes. we can conclude that an important transcriptional regulation of afd <dig> and dmc <dig> occurs during meiotic entry but is not essential later during the l/z transition. the status of the prai "meiocytes" is probably affected by another level of control for achieving a zygotene-like stage. other mechanisms such as post-transcriptional regulation and/or nuclear entry of specific meiotic proteins might then be more important for meiotic prophase progression  <cit> .

rad <dig>  another reca homolog, is required for homology searching, chromosome pairing, dna strand transfer , and double-strand break repair in meiosis and in dna repair in somatic cells  <cit> . rad <dig> protein is absent in am <dig> mutants  <cit> . neither rad51a nor rad51a <dig> transcript levels are affected, therefore, post-transcriptional regulation of rad <dig> protein levels is likely. rad <dig> is a branch migration protein that is involved in dissociating d-loops formed by dmc <dig> during meiosis as well as d-loops formed by rad <dig> though less efficiently  <cit> . interestingly, rad54-like transcript is significantly reduced in both am <dig> mutants.

skp1b of another known meiotic gene family is also down-regulated in both am <dig> mutants. the arabidopsis skp1-like <dig>  gene was previously reported to perform a critical role in recombination during the leptotene to pachytene stages  <cit> . ask <dig> protein is important for many cell processes including modifying and reconstructing meiotic chromatin  <cit>  and telomere formation  <cit> . telomere bouquets are missing in am1- <dig> and are retarded or incomplete in am1-prai  <cit> . telomere clustering on the nuclear envelope is another crucial event of meiotic chromosome organization during prophase i that occurs at the l/z transition in many organisms  <cit> . based on clustering analysis, rad54-like and skp1b expression patterns are very similar and dependent on am <dig>  therefore, all three proteins might work in concert to advance meiocytes through the l/z transition, the stage when am1-prai is arrested.

other interesting genes differentially expressed in both mutants compared to fertile that have been implicated in the meiotic process include always early <dig>  <cit> , werner syndrome helicase  <cit> , zap- <dig> telomerase  <cit> , and kinesin  <cit> . our analysis of these genes along with skp1b, rad54-like and am <dig> shows a predominant expression in meiocytes . this finding suggests that am <dig> interacts directly or indirectly with these proteins in establishing or stabilizing meiotic chromosomes. two good candidate genes for apomixis, afd <dig> and brassinosteroid insensitive1-associated receptor kinase genes  <cit> , were down-regulated in am1- <dig> anthers at  <dig>  mm and in both mutant anthers at  <dig>  mm, respectively.

according to palmer  <cit> , am1- <dig> anthers degenerate after one or  <dig> rounds of ectopic pmc mitosis and fail by the ~  <dig>  mm anther stage. am1- <dig> anthers also cease growth, and this is similar to most other pre-meiotic male-sterile mutants  <cit> . therefore, the continued growth of am1-prai anthers to 4- <dig> mm and their normal morphology indicate that the transcriptome differences are primarily causing defects in the pmcs and not significantly impairing somatic cell layers, despite inferred changes in the somatic and detected changes in the tapetal transcriptomes. we further conclude that meiotic entry by pmcs is sufficient to trigger somatic anther growth; the nature of the developmental signal is yet to be determined.

to more critically address the cell type specificity of transcriptome alterations, the  <dig> non-redundant genes differentially expressed in both am <dig> alleles were used to query gene lists derived from array profiling of laser microdissection-enriched pmcs or tapetal cells in normal anthers. fifty-six percent were expressed at least 2-fold higher in pmcs compared to those found in the immediately adjacent tapetum. our results indicate that either the complete absence of am <dig> or the presence of excess aberrant am1-prai protein has a profound impact on gene expression in the pmcs during the maturation phase from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm anther length, including the period of meiotic entry up to the l/z transition stage. based on estimation of the contribution of pmc rna to total anther rna  <cit> , we hypothesize that transcripts enriched 4-fold or higher could be pmc-specific. in fact, the highest enrichment observed was 9-fold, initially puzzling because pmcs are less than 1% of the cell population but should contain many unique transcripts associated with meiosis. after accounting for rna contribution, however, enrichment of 4- to 5-fold in isolated pmc is the expectation.

recently, multiple microarray or rna-seq analyses of purified meiocytes have been reported  <cit> . using manual methods or laser capture microdissection, meiocytes relatively free of contaminating somatic cells were obtained in sufficient numbers for analysis. the limitation of these rice and arabidopsis analyses was that all stages of meiosis were represented; even if there is little or no de novo transcription during meiosis, transcripts present initially in pmcs may have decayed during meiosis, and the mixed meiocyte population is hence not ideal for analysis. in these studies from  <dig> to  <dig>  meiocyte-specific transcript types were identified. for maize, we used whole anther analysis and comparison to an independent dataset of laser microdissected pmcs and tapetal cells in carefully staged  <dig>  mm fertile anthers at prophase i, and we also used the comparison of am1- <dig> and am1-prai to discover meiosis-associated genes. prophase i spans only one day of the  <dig> days in maize anther development. from our analysis,  <dig> pmc-enriched genes were identified as mis-regulated by both mutants within the narrow window of prophase i. additionally, we identified genes mis-regulated at the start of pmc maturation, particularly in the am1- <dig> mutant, that are likely associated with the suppression of mitosis and early preparation for meiosis.

our am <dig> transcriptome data can serve as a resource to decipher the complex networks of meiosis initiation in plants. comparing results from the two am <dig> alleles provides insights into multiple control points.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome changes in am <dig> anthers prior to meiosis lead to loss of meiotic competence in the pmcs. transcript types affected only in am1- <dig> anthers and resembling the am <dig> expression pattern likely define requirements for suppression of mitosis and entry into meiosis and ultimately influence the development and maturation of anther somatic layers; meiosis-associated processes affected in am1- <dig> mutants include genes important for sister chromatid cohesion, and rna interference. transcripts differentially regulated in both mutants are more likely related to progression through the l/z transition. this microarray analysis indicates that maize meiotic prophase is controlled at multiple levels and that am <dig> controls the rna level of only a subset of meiotic genes at the critical steps of meiotic entry and the l/z transition.
