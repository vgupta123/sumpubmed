BACKGROUND
gene expression analysis has become increasingly important in biological research where e.g. gene expression profiles from tissues associated with diseases and disorders have to be compared with each other and with those from normal tissues. one of the most powerful tools in this area is real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr . to account for differences in starting material, rna preparation, rna quality and cdna synthesis, adequate normalisation is frequently performed by comparing expression profiles of the genes of interest with those of constitutively expressed genes . housekeeping genes are most widely used as reference genes, based on the assumption that they are constitutively expressed in most tissues and under certain circumstances, and that they are more or less resistant to cell cycle fluctuations  <cit> . however, it has been demonstrated that the expression levels of these genes may vary considerably in different tissues, different cell types and different disease stages, particularly in clinical samples associated with malignant disease  <cit> . housekeeping genes are not only involved in the basal cell metabolism, but appear to participate in other functions too, and therefore are prone to regulation  <cit> . especially in tumours, the metabolism is generally elevated because of permanent proliferation and expansion. moreover, some housekeeping genes may have a specific function essential for the tumour metabolism and therefore be up or down regulated  <cit> . because of these findings, vandesompele et al  <cit>  proposed to identify a set of stable housekeeping genes in the tissue of interest and use them as internal reference genes for accurate normalisation.

up till now, only a few gene expression studies using real-time qrt-pcr have been performed in horses. gapdh or actb were commonly used as a single non-validated reference gene  <cit> , since at that time not much information was available concerning this issue. recently, waguespack et al  <cit>  compared  <dig> housekeeping genes  in the lamellae of the hoof in horses.

in this study,  <dig> commonly used reference genes in both human and animal studies were investigated, both in normal skin and in equine sarcoids of horses. equine sarcoids are fibroblastic skin tumours and are the most common tumours in horses. the disease not only induces esthetical defects, but also diminishes the economical value of affected horses  <cit> . moreover affected horses show a genetic predisposition for the development of equine sarcoids, through which the breeding value of an animal with sarcoids sharply declines  <cit> . the bovine papillomavirus  plays an important role in the aetiology of equine sarcoids  <cit> . several clinical types exist, ranging from small, stable patches to large, aggressive and fast growing tumours  <cit> . to be able to examine the gene expression profile of bpv in these different clinical types and to compare equine sarcoids with normal skin asymptomatically infected with bpv, a well suited internal control should first of all be established.

RESULTS
transcription profiling of the candidate genes
cdna was synthesised from dna-free rna  isolated from  <dig> normal equine skin and  <dig> equine sarcoid samples. a real-time pcr assay, based on sybr® green detection, was designed for the transcription profiling of six frequently used reference genes in these cdna samples. during optimisation of the protocol, real-time pcr products were visualised by gelelectrophoresis and sequenced for verification. for every assay, a single amplicon with the expected size was generated without primer dimer formation. indeed, the formation of primer dimers and unspecific amplification, which can falsely increase the gene expression levels, is a major point of attention, particularly when using intercalating dyes such as sybr® green.

amplicon sequences of actb, b2m, hprt <dig>  and tuba <dig> were 100% identical with the described sequences on which primer design was based. the sequencing of ubb revealed  <dig> gap and  <dig> snps compared to the original sequence . the gap is probably due to sequencing errors; the snps did not result in an amino acid variation. when translated to amino acid sequence, the rpl <dig> sequence was 100% identical to publicly accessible horse ests and human rpl <dig> amino acid sequences.

after optimisation, gene-specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in melt-curve analysis. for each assay, a standard curve was generated by using 10-fold serial dilutions of pooled cdna, generated of both normal skin and equine sarcoid tissue, characterised by a linear correlation coefficient  varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and a pcr efficiency between  <dig>  and  <dig> %. these findings showed that these assays are suitable for quantitative purposes.

in order to select a reliable set of reference genes, each assay was performed in duplicate and included the appropriate control samples. to compare the transcription level of the selected genes across the different samples, the ct values, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  were converted into raw data based on the pcr efficiency, gathered by standard curve analyses.

genorm analysis
the gene expression stability over the different samples was analysed using the genorm software  <cit> . the ranking of the  <dig> candidate reference genes according to their m value was not equivalent between the normal skin samples, the equine sarcoid samples and the combination of both kinds of samples. for normal skin actb, tuba <dig> and ubb were the  <dig> most stable genes ). in equine sarcoids on the other hand, actb, b2m and ubb proved to be the most stable genes with tuba <dig> being the least stable gene ). when both sets of samples were analysed together, the results showed that the combination of  <dig> genes  is sufficient for adequate normalisation ). the results are listed in table  <dig>  in another study  <cit> , where actb, b2m, gapdh and tbp were compared as reference genes, actb and b2m were found to be the best endogenous control genes for real-time qpcr of lamella in the hoof of horses.

when calculating a normalisation factor , a careful choice of the number of reference genes should be made. the more genes included, the more accurate the nf is. however, including too many genes may increase the risk of using unsuitable genes, and is also impractical. on the other hand, if the cut off is made too stringent, stably expressed reference genes may be excluded and accuracy might drop. in order to determine how many reference genes should be included, normalisation factors , based on the geometric mean of the expression levels of the n best reference genes, were calculated by inclusion of an extra, less stable, reference gene according to vandesompele et al  <cit> . figures 1a, 1b and 1c show the pairwise variation vn/vn+ <dig> between  <dig> sequential normalisation factors nfn and nfn+ <dig> for normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both kinds of samples. in all  <dig> cases, the inclusion of a 4th gene had no significant contribution  to the nf. the  <dig> member sets as described above are a good choice for the calculation of the nf.

implementation of results in clinical research
for the reasons discussed above, we have confidence that our gene expression results are accurate and reliable. the described set of reference genes can be used in gene expression studies both in normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both. one of the points of interest in veterinary medicine is the expression level of bpv in different kinds of equine sarcoids. with the normalisation technique described in this study, reliable results can be obtained. another research topic in this domain is the study of bpv expression in normal skin, showing latent infection with bpv. also, the expression level of specific horse genes with a putative role in tumourigenesis, can be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a method for genomic dna-free rna extraction from normal equine skin and equine sarcoids was optimised and a reference gene assay for reliable normalisation of real-time qpcr data, obtained from normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both, was designed. the profiling of the gene expression pattern of  <dig> putative reference genes showed that  <dig> reference genes should be used. actb, tuba <dig> and ubb can be used in normal skin, while actb, b2m and ubb are the best choice in equine sarcoids. if normal skin and equine sarcoids have to be compared, the same member set as proposed for equine sarcoids can be used.
