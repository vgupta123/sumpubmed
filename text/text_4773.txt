BACKGROUND
immunity-related gtpases  comprise a family of dynamin-related cell-autonomous resistance proteins targeting intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , mycobacterium avium  <cit> , listeria monocytogenes  <cit> , trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> , and toxoplasma gondii . in mice, the  <dig> irg members are induced by interferons, whereas the single human homologue is constitutively expressed in some tissues, especially in testis  <cit> . in non-infected cells, most irgs are largely cytosolic. however, members of a small sub-family with regulatory function  <cit>  associate with specific intracellular membranes, with one member favoring the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit>  and others the golgi membrane  <cit>  and the endolysosomal system  <cit> . infection by certain intracellular pathogens initiates the redistribution of several effector members to the parasitophorous vacuole, followed by its disruption  <cit> . in this way, irgs contribute to the release of the pathogen into the cytoplasm and its subsequent destruction.

irga <dig>  one of the effector irg proteins, localizes to the intact parasitophorous vacuole membrane  and, after disruption of the pvm, is found associated with vesicular accumulations, presumably derived from the pvm  <cit> . a myristoylation site at gly <dig> is necessary for the recruitment to the pvm but not for the weak constitutive binding to the er membrane  <cit> . an internally oriented antibody epitope on helix a between positions  <dig> and  <dig> was demonstrated to be accessible in the gtp-, but not in the gdp-bound state  <cit> . this indicates large-scale structural changes upon gtp binding that probably include exposure of the myristoyl group, enhancing binding to the pvm. biochemical studies indicated that irga <dig> hydrolyses gtp in a cooperative manner and forms gtp-dependent oligomers in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

crystal structures of irga <dig> in various nucleotide-loaded states revealed the basic architecture of irg proteins, including a gtpase domain and a composite helical domain  <cit> . these studies additionally showed a dimerization interface in the nucleotide-free protein as well as in all nucleotide-bound states. it involves a gtpase domain surface, which is located at the opposite side of the nucleotide, and an interface in the helical domain, with a water-filled gap between the two contact surfaces. mutagenesis of the contact surfaces suggests that this "backside" interface is not required for gtp-dependent oligomerization or cooperative hydrolysis, despite an earlier suggestion to the contrary  <cit> .

extensive biochemical studies suggested that gtp-induced oligomerization of irga <dig> requires an interface in the gtpase domain across the nucleotide-binding site  <cit> . recent structural studies indicated that a 'g interface' is typical of dynamin superfamily members, such as dynamin  <cit> , mxa  <cit> , the guanylate binding protein- <dig>   <cit> , atlastin  <cit>  and the bacterial dynamin-like proteins   <cit> . for several of these proteins, formation of the g interface was shown to trigger gtp hydrolysis by inducing rearrangements of catalytic residues in cis. in dynamin, the g interface includes residues in the phosphate binding loop, the two switch regions, the 'trans stabilizing loop' and the 'g <dig> loop'. for irga <dig>  it was demonstrated that besides residues in the switch i and switch ii regions, the 3'-oh group of the ribose participates in this interface  <cit> . since the signal recognition particle gtpase and its homologous receptor  also employ the 3'-oh ribose group to dimerize in an anti-parallel orientation therefore activating its gtpase  <cit> , an analogous dimerization model was proposed for irga <dig>  <cit> . however, the crystal structure of irga <dig> in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable gtp analogue 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate  showed only subtle differences relative to the apo or gdp-bound protein and did not reveal a new dimer interface associated with the gtpase domain  <cit> . this structure was obtained by soaking gmppnp in nucleotide-free crystals of irga <dig>  an approach which may have interfered with nucleotide-induced domain rearrangements.

to clarify the dimerization mode via the g interface, we determined the gmppnp-bound crystal structure of a non-oligomerizing irga <dig> variant. the structure revealed that irga <dig> can dimerize via the g interface in a parallel head-to-head fashion. this dimerization mode explains previously published biochemical data, and shows in particular how the 3'-oh group of the ribose participates in the assembly. our data suggest that a parallel dimerization mode may be a unifying feature in all dynamin and septin superfamily proteins.

RESULTS
previous results indicated that irga <dig> mutations in a loosely defined surface region , which is distant from the g-interface and only slightly overlapping with the backside interface , individually reduced gtp-dependent oligomerization  <cit> . a combination of four of these mutations  essentially eliminated gtp-dependent assembly  and allowed crystallization of irga <dig> in the presence of gmppnp. crystals diffracted to  <dig>  Å resolution and displayed one exceptionally long unit cell axis of  <dig> Å . the structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to rwork/rfree of  <dig>  %/ <dig>  % . the asymmetric unit contained seven irga <dig> molecules that were arranged in a helical pattern along the long cell axis .

like other dynamin superfamily members, the gtpase domain of irga <dig> comprises a canonical gtpase domain fold, with a central β-sheet surrounded by helices on both sides . the helical domain is a bipartite structure composed of helices αa-c at the n-terminus and helix αf-l at the c-terminus of the gtpase domain. overall, the seven molecules in the asymmetric unit are very similar to each other, with root mean square deviations  ranging from  <dig>  –  <dig>  Å over all cα atoms. the structures of the seven molecules also agree well with the previously determined structure of native gmppnp-bound irga <dig> .fig.  <dig> structure of the irga <dig> dimer. a schematic view of the domain architecture of mouse irga <dig>  the first and last amino acids of each domain are indicated. b ribbon-type representation of the irga <dig> dimer. in the left molecule, domains are colored according to the domain architecture, the right molecule is colored in grey. the nucleotide and mg2+ ion  are shown in sphere representation. the gtpase domain dimer is boxed. the dotted line indicates a 2-fold axis. secondary structure was numbered according to ref.  <cit> . c

the seven irga <dig> molecules in the asymmetric unit form various higher order contacts in the crystals. within the asymmetric unit, six molecules dimerize via the symmetric backside dimer interface , and the remaining seventh molecule forms the same type of interaction with its symmetry mate of the adjacent asymmetric unit . this indicates that the introduced mutations in the secondary patch, from which only lys <dig> is part of the backside interface, do, in fact, not prevent this interaction.

another assembly interface with a buried surface area of  <dig> Å <dig>  which we call the “tertiary patch”, was formed via two interaction sites in the helical domains . in this interface, helices αk from two adjacent molecules form a hydrogen bonding network involving residues 373- <dig>  furthermore, two adjacent helices αa form hydrophobic contacts. it was previously shown that the double mutation l372r/a373r did not prevent gtp-induced assembly  <cit> , so there is currently no evidence supporting an involvement of this interface in higher-order oligomerization.

strikingly, molecule a of one asymmetric unit assembled with an equivalent molecule of the adjacent asymmetric unit via the g-interface in a symmetric parallel fashion via a  <dig> Å <dig> interface. this assembly results in a butterfly-shaped irga <dig> dimer in which the helical domains protrude in parallel orientations . in contrast, the other six molecules in the asymmetric unit do not assemble via the g interface.

the g interface in molecule a can be subdivided into three distinct contact sites . contact site i is formed between r <dig> and k <dig> in the trans stabilizing loops, and s <dig> in the switch ii regions of the opposing molecules. contact site ii features polar and hydrophobic interactions formed by switch i  with a helix following the guanine specificity motif  and the trans stabilizing loop  of the opposing gtpase domain. in contact site iii, g <dig> of switch i interacts via its main chain nitrogen with the exocyclic 2’-oh and 3’-oh groups of the opposing ribose in trans, whereas the two opposing exocyclic 3’-oh group of the ribose form hydrogen bonds with each other. via the ribose contact, switch i is pulled towards the opposing nucleotide . in turn, e <dig> of switch i reorients towards the nucleotide and now participates in the coordination of the mg2+ ion . e <dig> was previously shown to be essential for catalysis  <cit> , and the observed interactions in contact site iii explain how dimerization via the ribose is directly coupled to the activation of gtp hydrolysis.

the g interface is in full agreement with previously published biochemical data that indicate crucial roles of e <dig>  g <dig>  e <dig>  s <dig>  r <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  d <dig>  n <dig>  and k <dig> for oligomerization and oligomerization-induced gtp hydrolysis  <cit> . all of these residues directly participate in contacts  or are in direct vicinity to the interface . residues e <dig>  k <dig>  and d <dig> appear to orient the trans stabilizing loop which is involved in interface formation in contact site ii. in the earlier model of an anti-parallel g interface, it was not possible to position the side chain of r <dig> to avoid steric conflict  <cit> . in the present structure, the side-chain of r <dig> projects laterally along the g interface and, therefore, does not cause a steric conflict.

the buried surface area per molecule  of the g interface in irga <dig> is relatively small  compared to that of other dynamin superfamily members, such as dynamin , atlastin , gbp- <dig> , bdlp  or the septin-related gtpase of immunity associated protein  <dig>   . however, the relative orientations of the gtpase domains in these dimers are strikingly similar, and the same elements, such as switch i, switch ii, the trans activating and g <dig> loops are involved in the parallel dimerization mode in all of these gtpase families.fig.  <dig> a conserved dimerization mode via the g interface in dynamin and septin gtpases. the overall architecture of the parallel gtpase domain dimer of irga <dig> is related to that of other dynamin and septin superfamily proteins. the following structures are shown in cylinder representations, in similar orientations of their gtpase domains: a the gmppnp-bound irga <dig> dimer, b the gdp-alf4

discussion
irg proteins are crucial mediators of the innate immune response in mice against a specific subset of intracellular pathogens, all of which enter the cell to form a membrane-bounded vacuole without engagement of the phagocytic machinery. as members of the dynamin superfamily, irgs oligomerize at cellular membranes in response to gtp binding. oligomerization and oligomerization-induced gtp hydrolysis are thought to induce membrane remodeling events ultimately leading to disruption of the pvm. recent structural and mechanistic analyses have begun to unravel the molecular basis for the membrane-remodeling activity and mechano-chemical function of some members . for example, for dynamin and atlastin, it was shown that gtp binding and/or hydrolysis leads to dimerization of the gtpase domains and to the reorientation of the adjacent helical domains. the resulting domain movement was suggested to act as a “power stroke” during membrane remodeling events  <cit> . however, for other dynamin superfamily members such as irgs, the molecular basis for gtp hydrolysis and the exact role of the mechano-chemical function are still unclear.

our structural analysis of an oligomerization- and gtpase-defective irga <dig> mutant indicates that irga <dig> dimerizes via the g interface in a parallel orientation. only one of the seven irga <dig> molecules in the asymmetric unit formed this contact pointing to a low affinity interaction via the g interface, which is in agreement with its small size. in the crystals, dimerization via the g interface is promoted by the high protein concentrations which may mimic a situation when irga <dig> oligomerizes on a membrane surface. such a low affinity interaction mode may allow reversibility of oligomerization following gtp hydrolysis. similar low affinity g interface interactions were reported for dynamin  <cit>  and mxa  <cit> .

the dimerization mode is strikingly different from the previously proposed anti-parallel model  <cit>  that was based on the crystal structure of the signal recognition particle gtpase, srp <dig> and its homologous receptor  <cit> . however, the g dimer interface is reminiscent of the gtpase domain dimers observed for several other dynamin superfamily members, such as dynamin, gbp <dig>  atlastin, and bdlp. it was recently shown that septin  <cit>  and septin-related gtpases, such as the tocs gtpases  <cit>  or gtpases of immunity related proteins   <cit> , also employ a gtp-dependent parallel dimerization mode. based on phylogenetic and structural analysis, these observations suggest that dynamin and septin superfamilies are derived from a common ancestral membrane-associated gtpase that featured a gtp-dependent parallel dimerization mode  <cit> . importantly, our analysis indicates that irgs are not outliers, but bona-fide representatives of the dynamin superfamily.

whereas the overall dimerization mode is similar in septin and dynamin gtpases, family-specific differences in the g interface and the oligomerization interfaces exist. for example, the involvement of the 2’ and 3’-oh groups of the ribose in the dimerization interface of irga <dig> has not been observed for other dynamin and septin superfamily members. the surface-exposed location of the ribose in the irga <dig> structure, with a wide-open nucleotide-binding pocket, facilitates its engagement in the dimerization interface. this contact, in turn, appears to activate gtp hydrolysis by inducing rearrangements in switch i and the positioning of the catalytic e <dig>  during dimerization of gbp <dig>  an arginine finger from the p loop reorients towards the nucleotide in cis to trigger gtp hydrolysis  <cit> . in dynamin, the corresponding serine residue coordinates a sodium ion that is crucial for gtp hydrolysis  <cit> . irga <dig> bears gly <dig> at this position, which in the dimerizing molecule a appears to approach the bridging imido group of gmppnp via a main chain hydrogen bond. higher resolution structures of the irga <dig> dimer in the presence of a transition state analogue are required to show whether gly <dig> directly participates in gtp hydrolysis or whether it may also position a catalytic cation.

in dynamin, further assembly sites are provided by the helical domains which assemble in a criss-cross fashion to form a helical filament. in dynamin-related eps <dig> homology domain containing proteins , a second assembly interface is present in the gtpase domain  <cit> . for irga <dig>  additional interfaces in the helical domain are presumably involved in oligomerization, such as the secondary patch residues whose mutation prevented oligomerization in the crystallized mutant. further structural studies, especially electron microscopy analysis of the irga <dig> oligomers, are required to clarify the assembly mode via the helical domains and to show how these interfaces cooperate with the g interface to mediate the regulated assembly on a membrane surface. notably, we did not observe major rearrangements of the helical domain versus the gtpase domain in the irga <dig> molecules that dimerized via the g interface. in a manner similar to bdlp  <cit> , such large-scale conformational changes may be induced by membrane binding. our structural analysis and the identification of the g-interface paves the way for determining the specific assembly of irga <dig> into a membrane-associated scaffold as the prerequisite to understand its action as an anti-parasitic machine.
