BACKGROUND
the calcitonin gene-related peptide  belongs to a family of related peptides that includes calcitonin , adrenomedullin  and amylin   <cit> . to date, cgrp is one of the most potent endogenous vasodilatory peptides discovered. cgrp mediates sensory neurotransmission and inhibits insulin action on carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . cgrp has been shown to modulate immune function by inhibiting the proliferation of t cells and synthesis of t cell-derived cytokines il- <dig> and ifn-γ  <cit> . in the lung, cgrp mediates multiple effects some of which have potential implications in airway homeostasis  <cit> . cgrp has also been shown to have cardioprotective effects in rats and humans  <cit> . in skeletal muscle, cgrp potentiates muscle contraction  <cit> , increases the numbers of acetylcholine receptors   <cit>  and their rate of desensitisation  <cit> . in addition, cgrp locally increases the rate of blood flow following muscle contraction  <cit> .

the effects of cgrp are mediated by cgrp receptors that are generated by a complex of proteins  <cit> . cgrp receptors are formed by the interaction of two separate proteins. the first protein component is the calcitonin receptor like  receptor. the cl receptor is a seven transmembrane-domain receptor but is inactive when expressed in cells alone  <cit> . the second protein component required for cgrp receptor function is receptor activity modifying protein- <dig> . ramp- <dig> acts as a molecular chaperone and is required for the transportation of the cl receptor to the cell surface in addition to pharmacologic specificity  <cit> .

ramps are a recently identified group of single transmembrane-domain accessory proteins. to date, three members of the ramp family have been identified   <cit> . all share 30% sequence identity, differ in their tissue distributions and are comprised of approximately  <dig> amino acids that make up a large extracellular n-terminal domain, a single membrane-spanning domain and a short cytoplasmic domain  <cit> . recently, christopoulos et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ramps interact with a number of class ii g protein-coupled receptors  in addition to the cl receptor. these include the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide receptor , the glucagon and parathyroid hormone receptors . vpac1r/ramp- <dig> heterodimers display a significant enhancement of agonist-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis compared with vpac1r alone. this suggests that ramps may play a more general role in modulating cell signalling through other gpcrs than previously thought.

despite the crucial role ramp- <dig> plays in the generation of cgrp receptors, little is known about the molecular mechanism regulating ramp- <dig> gene expression. it is likely that such mechanism play an important role in modulating the responsiveness of specific tissues to cgrp. to initiate studies on ramp- <dig> gene regulation, we cloned and characterised the mouse ramp- <dig> gene promoter. analysis in three different ramp- <dig> positive mouse tissues revealed multiple start sites of transcription. rt-pcr analysis of ramp- <dig> mrna in the c2c <dig> myoblast cell line demonstrated that endogenous ramp- <dig> gene expression was greatest in confluent cultures compared to non-confluent or fused cells. through the use of ramp- <dig> promoter/luciferase constructs transfected into c2c <dig> myoblast cells and nih 3t <dig> cells, we studied the effects ramp- <dig> promoter deletions had on ramp- <dig> transcriptional activity. we further demonstrated that the ramp- <dig> promoter activity was tissue-specific and not expressed in the ramp- <dig> negative cell line hek <dig>  finally, we identified a repressor element in the ramp- <dig> promoter which when deleted activates ramp- <dig> promoter activity in hek <dig> cells. this suggests the ramp- <dig> gene is negatively regulated in non-ramp- <dig> expressing cells.

RESULTS
determination of ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation sites and pcr cloning the mouse ramp- <dig> promoter
to date, the transcriptional initiation sites for any mouse ramp transcript have not yet been determined. we therefore performed 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends  analysis to map ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation sites. for these experiments, rna from a number of known ramp- <dig> positive mouse tissues  was employed. sequence analysis of 8– <dig> 5' race clones from each tissue demonstrated multiple start sites of transcription . all transcriptional start sites in mouse heart, brain and skeletal muscle occurred within a  <dig> bp region directly 5' to ramp-1's start site of translation. as demonstrated by the dna sequence analysis above, this region is highly gc rich . these results suggest that ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation sites do not significantly vary between the different ramp- <dig> positive tissues tested.

having identified ramp-1's major transcriptional initiation sites, we next wished to clone and characterise the mouse ramp- <dig> gene promoter. since extensive sequence data both 5' and 3' to ramp-1's transcriptional start sites is available on the mouse genome data base  we employed ramp- <dig> specific primers and pcr on mouse genomic dna to generate a dna fragment containing  <dig>  kb of ramp- <dig> 5' flanking region. promoter sequence motifs in the proximal  <dig>  kb of 5' flanking region corresponding to consensus binding sites for a variety of transcription factors are present . these include binding sites for the transcription factors nfκb, pbx <dig>  aml <dig>  oct <dig>  mitf, tef <dig> and sp <dig>  of note is a  <dig> bp region  containing multiple gaaa and ggaa repeat sequences and a highly gc rich  region of  <dig> bp region immediately 5' of the start site of translation . this gc rich region contains a potential binding site for the transcription factor sp <dig> 

ramp- <dig> gene expression in c2c <dig> myoblasts and myotubes
northern blot analysis has demonstrated that the ramp- <dig> gene is expressed in mouse skeletal muscle  <cit> . since a variety of muscle cell lines are widely available and are easily transfected with dna constructs, we decided to employ such cell lines for our studies on the transcriptional regulation of the mouse ramp- <dig> gene. before undertaking transfection experiments in a muscle cell line, we first studied endogenous ramp- <dig> gene expression in the myoblast cell line c2c <dig>  upon incubation with reduced serum levels and high cell density, c2c <dig> myoblasts fuse and form myotubes. pittner et al.  <cit>  previously demonstrated that incubation of this cell line with cgrp induces an increase in intracellular levels of camp making it highly likely this cell line expresses ramp- <dig> mrna. we therefore assayed ramp- <dig> gene expression in this cell line by semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis on total rna from non-confluent, confluent and fused c2c <dig> myoblasts. southern blot analysis of rt-pcr products from these cells demonstrated the presence of ramp- <dig> mrna under all culture conditions . however, ramp- <dig> mrna levels appeared to be highest in confluent versus non-confluent and fused c2c <dig> myoblasts. densitomitry demonstrated that ramp- <dig> mrna expression was at least  <dig> times higher in confluent vs. non-confluent myoblasts.

ramp- <dig> promoter deletional analysis in transiently transfected c2c <dig> myoblasts
to delineate potential transcriptional regulatory elements in the  <dig>  kb ramp- <dig> promoter, a series of 5' ramp- <dig> promoter/luciferase constructs were generated. luciferase analysis on transfected confluent c2c <dig> myoblasts revealed that a ramp- <dig> promoter/luciferase construct with approximately  <dig>  kb of 5' flanking region  had the greatest levels of luciferase activity . deletion of approximately  <dig> bp of 5' flanking region  caused up to a 55% drop in expression levels. deletions to - <dig> of ramp- <dig> 5' region did not cause additional decreases in promoter activity. however, deletion to - <dig> reduced ramp- <dig> promoter activity to 7-fold above background levels . similar results were obtained when ramp- <dig> promoter/lucifersase constructs were transfected into ramp- <dig> positive mouse nih 3t <dig> cells.

to determine if the ramp- <dig> promoter demonstrates tissue specificity in transfected cell lines, we compared the transcriptional activity of the ramp- <dig> promoter in transfected c2c <dig> myoblasts and a cell line known to not express ramp- <dig> mrna . luciferase analysis demonstrated that constructs containing  <dig>  kb to  <dig> bp of ramp- <dig> 5' flanking region were transcriptionally inactive in hek <dig> cells. a construct containing  <dig> bp of ramp- <dig> 5' flanking region demonstrated modest transcriptional activity while a construct containing  <dig> bp of 5' flanking region demonstrated significant promoter activity. the results of these experiments suggest that the ramp- <dig> promoter region between - <dig> and - <dig> contains a regulatory element that represses ramp- <dig> promoter activity in a non-ramp- <dig> expressing cell line.

silencer activity of the ramp- <dig> repressor element
we wished to determine if the ramp- <dig> repressor element could repress ramp- <dig> promoter activity in a position and orientation independent manner . we therefore employed pcr to generate a fragment  containing the ramp- <dig> repressor element. the fragment was then cloned in two orientations 3' to the luciferase gene in the - <dig> ramp- <dig> promoter/luciferase construct. the expression of these constructs was compared to activity from the - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> ramp- <dig> promoter/luciferase constructs in transfected hek <dig> cells. luciferase assays demonstrated that the repressor element reduced expression from the - <dig> ramp-1/luciferase construct by approximately 50% . an unpaired student's t-test revealed that these differences were statistically significant . however, these constructs demonstrated significantly higher levels of activity than the - <dig> ramp-1/luciferase construct . these results suggest that the ramp- <dig> repressor element located between - <dig> and - <dig> bp of ramp- <dig> 5' flanking region has modest but statistically significant silencer activity and functions best in its native position.

discussion
despite the important role ramp- <dig> plays in cgrp cell signalling little is known about the transcriptional regulation of ramp- <dig> gene. to date, no ramp- <dig> gene promoter has been identified/cloned and ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation sites have not been determined in any ramp- <dig> positive tissues. in the present study, we cloned the mouse ramp- <dig> gene promoter and mapped multiple ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation sites in a variety of ramp- <dig> positive tissues. our data demonstrates that ramp- <dig> transcriptional initiation occurs at similar sites and all within a  <dig> bp region in different ramp- <dig> mrna positive tissues.

to initiate studies on the transcriptional regulation of the mouse ramp- <dig> gene during muscle differentiation, we examined ramp- <dig> gene expression in c2c <dig> mouse myoblasts by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. our results suggest that ramp- <dig> gene expression is present in non-confluent, confluent and fused c2c <dig> cells. however ramp- <dig> mrna expression appears to be increased in confluent and fused c2c <dig> cells. chakravarty et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a strong correlation exists between the level of ramp- <dig> mrna expression and cgrp binding. this suggests that the transcriptional activity of the ramp- <dig> gene may control the responsiveness of tissues to cgrp. it will be important to determine if increased ramp- <dig> mrna expression in confluent and fused c2c <dig> cells results in significantly higher levels of cgrp receptor expression and increases in intracellular camp after treatment with cgrp. the role increased ramp- <dig> mrna gene expression plays in the process of c2c <dig> induced muscle differentiation is not yet clear. nobel et al.  <cit>  showed that cgrp causes increased creatine kinase activity in myoblast cultures. creatine kinase activity is a well established marker of fused myoblasts . it is reasonable to hypothesise that increased ramp- <dig> gene expression in confluent c2c12s makes these cells more responsive to cgrp and thus may facilitate myoblast fusion.

deletional mapping of the ramp- <dig> gene promoter revealed that a  <dig>  kb promoter fragment generates the highest levels of ramp- <dig> promoter activity. however, a ramp- <dig> promoter construct with only  <dig> bp of 5' region contains nearly 40% percent activity of the entire promoter. the delineation of such a small functional ramp- <dig> promoter should facilitate the identification of dna regulatory elements and the transcription factors they interact that activate ramp- <dig> promoter activity in c2c <dig> cells.

transfection of ramp- <dig> promoter/luciferase constructs into ramp- <dig> negative hek <dig> cells demonstrated that a transcriptional control element present between - <dig> and - <dig> in the ramp- <dig> promoter represses ramp- <dig> promoter activity in the ramp- <dig> negative-expressing cell line hek <dig> cells. while this element appears to have modest silencing activity, our results suggest that full repressor activity of this element requires it to be in its native position within the ramp- <dig> promoter. we hypothesise that negative-regulatory transcription factors, present in non-ramp- <dig> expressing cells, bind to this element and repress ramp- <dig> gene expression. computer analysis of the  <dig> bp ramp- <dig> repressor element has revealed potential binding sites for a variety of positive acting transcription factors such as myod, c-myb, nf <dig> and elk- <dig>  importantly, binding sites for two transcriptional repressors have also been identified: mammalian transcriptional repressor rbpjkappa/cbf  and bzip domain, transcriptional repressor . studies on the roles these transcription factors play in the repression of ramp- <dig> gene expression are now underway.

CONCLUSIONS
promoter deletional analysis demonstrated that both positive and negative acting transcription factors regulate the tissue specificity of the ramp- <dig> gene. dnase  <dig> protection and gel-shift experiments with extracts from c2c <dig> and hek <dig> cells are underway to identify specific dna sequences and the potential transcription factors they bind that mediate the activity of the ramp- <dig> gene in ramp- <dig> expressing and non- expressing cells. once specific sequences/factors binding to the ramp- <dig> repressor element are isolated, the effects that mutating these sequences has on ramp- <dig> promoter activity in transgenic mice will be tested. these experiments will enable us to test the role such sequences/factors play in regulating the tissue-specific expression and activity levels of the ramp- <dig> gene in vivo. such transcriptional mechanism are likely to play an important role in modulating the responsiveness of tissues to cgrp and may prove useful targets for future drug development aimed at regulating cgrp receptor gene expression.
