BACKGROUND
toll-like receptors  are type  <dig> transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface and intracellular compartments of many cell types including epithelial cells and a variety of immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. tlr ligands include pathogen-associated molecular pattern  molecules, and tlrs are amongst the first receptors to respond to pathogen presence  <cit> , hence their key role in innate immunity to infection. at least  <dig> tlrs have been identified in mammals and collectively these recognize a wide repertoire of microbial organisms and pathogens including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi  <cit> . the tlr protein is comprised of three main regions: an extracellular pattern-recognition receptor domain , a transmembrane region and an intracellular tir signalling domain  <cit> . the signalling domain is highly conserved across the tlrs. in contrast, the ecd involved in pathogen detection is often variable  <cit> .

tlr <dig> is known to bind bacterial flagellin  <cit> . both flagellin   <cit> ), and the ecd of tlr <dig> in primates  <cit>  and other mammals  <cit>  show evidence of adaptive positive selection. this suggests that interspecies competition between host and pathogen is likely to be driving the co-evolution of pathogen and host. in support of this, species-specific single nucleotide variations in the tlr <dig> gene exist and a single nucleotide polymorphism  in the ecd of mouse, chicken and human tlr <dig> is associated with a species-specific response to flagellin  <cit> .

the domestication of livestock by selection of desirable traits gave rise to the concept of breeds over 200 years ago  <cit> . this formation of breeds by selective interbreeding offers a unique opportunity to examine an accelerated process of natural selection. to investigate the evolution of the tlr <dig> gene in domestic livestock compared to other mammals we used phylogenetic methods to identify species-specific and branch-specific evidence of positive selection. to investigate the potential role of recent variation on evolution of the tlr <dig> gene we also identified known and novel snps in the coding region of tlr <dig> of sheep and cattle breeds.

RESULTS
evidence for adaptive evolution in mammalian tlr5
positive diversifying selection acting on a gene can be inferred when the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous  substitution rates is greater than  <dig>  this ratio dn/ds  provides a method to compare the evolutionary history of codons and lineages  <cit> . the parameters dn and ds can be estimated by a number of approaches. we applied the codon models of paml  <cit>  to infer estimates of parameters under a maximum likelihood framework. the results are summarized in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  complete results and parameter estimates for all paml analyses are given as additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>

when comparing rates of codon evolution in tlr <dig> since the divergence of the mammals  significant evidence  was found to suggest that positive selection has been acting on three codons  table  <dig>  when using the branch-site test  to compare each lineage independently, significant evidence was obtained that the sloth, sheep, cattle and pig lineages were each evolving at an elevated rate compared to other branches of the phylogeny. three positively-selected codons  were detected in the cattle lineage. one codon  was identified in the sheep lineage and one codon  was identified in the pig lineage . these sites are in addition to those identified as having evolved under positive selection across the mammalian lineage.

using the multiple branch-sites analysis , positive selection of tlr <dig> was detected in the artiodactyls, which contain the domestic ungulate species , but not in the laurasiatheria  or in the separate euarchontoglires and primate clades . in the artiodactyls, eight codons of tlr <dig> were detected with significant evidence of positive selection in . five codons  were only identified as having evolved under positive selection when the members of the artiodactyla were combined in the multiple branch-sites analysis. three codons  were detected previously in ungulate species-specific lineages .

when mapped onto the predicted tertiary structure of bovine tlr <dig>  the location of sites of positive selection detected by all approaches revealed a bias in their distribution. eleven  of the thirteen positively-selected codons encode amino acids in the ecd . when the total number of sites in the ecd compared to the rest of the protein are accounted for, this enrichment remains statistically-significant . additionally five of these  which exhibited evidence of positive selection in the artiodactyl clade are located within the putative flagellin-binding region of the ecd close to the conserved concave surface-associated with ligand binding  <cit>  . 

snp detection
a total of  <dig> polymorphic sites were detected in cattle and  <dig> in sheep. no overlap between cattle and sheep was seen . all but the mongolian cattle breed and the soay sheep breed showed variability within tested individuals .

of the  <dig> polymorphisms detected in cattle,  <dig> are synonymous substitutions and  <dig> are non-synonymous substitutions. twelve of the snps detected have been previously reported  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> snps were novel discoveries of this study, and three of these were non-synonymous . all except two polymorphisms are sub-species specific, with bos indicus displaying the highest degree of genetic variability . analysis of sheep breeds identified  <dig> novel snps, of which  <dig> were synonymous and  <dig> were non synonymous substitutions . in addition, two snps were identified which are predicted to cause premature stop codons in cattle tlr <dig> . r125* was detected in the jersey breed and has recently been reported . the other putative stop codon  was detected in a selection of bos taurus breeds and is a novel discovery of this study. pseudogenes are predicted to evolve under neutral selection and as such are not subject to the same evolutionary constraints assumed for protein coding genes. thus to avoid possible problems of including potential pseudogenes in evolutionary analyses, the stop codon variants were excluded from paml analysis.

co-localisation of snps and positively-selected sites
two non-synonymous snps detected in the bovine species co-occurred at codons detected as evolving under positive selection. codon l <dig>  is positioned at the n-terminal region of the extracellular domain of tlr <dig>  amino acid a <dig>  is located in the transmembrane region and is predicted to extend this domain . in sheep, two non-synonymous snps at position  <dig> and  <dig> of codon a <dig> were also detected . due to the relatively low density of snps in close proximity within a single gene, these were not used to estimate population genetic measures such as linkage disequilibrium.

discussion
whilst many studies of the phylogeny and comparative genomics of the tlr gene family exist, this is the first study to characterize the lineage-specific adaptive evolution of the tlr <dig> gene across clades of the mammalian phylogeny. three codons  exhibited clear evidence for positive selection across the mammalian phylogeny. this extends previous discoveries that detected positive selection in tlr <dig> in primate species  <cit>  or in selected mammalian species  <cit> . areal et al. showed that positive selection is seen in a number of genes of the tlr family of proteins including multiple sites of positive selection in the tlr <dig> genes when using a subset of mammals  <cit> . whilst our findings largely support those of their study areal et al used a reduced group of animals to identify positive selection. seventeen species were studied compared to the  <dig> species of mammal used in this study. the current study is proposed to have increased power to resolve true signature of positive selection. importantly the areal study included the chicken tlr <dig> gene sequence  in the analysis of tlr <dig> . this would potentially introduce the problem of saturation . additionally, our study included the novel analysis of groups of lineages to investigate changes in evolutionary constraint in different lineages within the mammals. when dn/ds between lineages or clades were compared  the artiodactyl lineage and the individual porcine, ovine and bovine lineages comprising this clade exhibited significant evidence of adaptive evolution . within the artiodactyl clade, eight positively-selected sites were detected. positive selective pressure on genes is symptomatic of functional adaptations acquired during the evolution of species and can promote species functional diversification  <cit> . this suggests that positive selection observed within the artiodactyl clade is different when compared to that seen in other mammals. we postulate that adaptive evolution observed in tlr <dig> of domestic livestock is a result of the breeding process. in support of this, it has been previously proposed that ruminant species are undergoing differential selective pressure in the related tlr <dig> genes  <cit> . this phenomenon may be directly caused by selective breeding resulting in a rapidly restricted population. the effective population size of all cattle breeds is known to have decreased in recent history and this may reflect initial domestication, breed formation or selection for breed specific production traits   <cit> . however, the genetic diversity of cattle as opposed to other species such as dogs is not as low as the effective population size would suggest and high levels of divergent selection associated with immune genes amongst others are detectable  <cit> . as genes such as those of the mhc show balancing selection between breeds  <cit> , an alternative proposal is that the breeding process indirectly drove changes in host-pathogen interactions. by increasing animal density, pathogen transmission and load may also have been increased providing the selective drive for rapid adaptation of host and pathogen genes. eleven of the  <dig> positively-selected sites are positioned in the ecd of tlr <dig> – the part of the protein involved in flagellin recognition. it is known that variability within this region influences species-specific ligand recognition  <cit> . evidence of increased positive selection within the extracellular domain supports the hypothesis that competition with flagellated bacterial pathogens is driving adaptation in specific host tlr <dig> ecd and more precisely in the flagellin-binding region. this may be counterintuitive as many livestock will be expected to share similar microbiota and pathogens. however, tlr5-flagellin interaction has recently been mapped at the single amino acid level  <cit>  suggesting that changes of amino-acids within either, tlr <dig> or flagellin can alter the species-specific tlr <dig> response. this in turn may influence the host range and susceptibility of infection. such amino-acid changes could explain some of the biological differences seen in the response of different species to flagellin. indeed, chicken tlr <dig> has been shown to recognise different flagellin-forms compared to human or murine tlr <dig>  <cit> , and bovine tlr <dig> has been shown to have a reduced response to recombinant flic of s. typhimurium <cit> . these differences are partially based on flagellin-amino-acid differences, and alteration of these amino acids in different flagellins alters their interaction with tlr <dig> from different species  <cit> . it has been proposed that pamp ligands engage with the concave surface of their cognate tlr ecds  <cit> . five codons  under positive selection in the artiodactyl clade are in close proximity to this conserved cavity. the non-synonymous snps detected within the putative flagellin-binding region are good candidates for genetic variants most likely to impact upon the immune response mediated by tlr <dig>  the function of some of these variants is currently being pursued. however, sites more distal to the flagellin-binding region may also be of importance in tlr ligand recognition and function, for example by altering the shape of the molecule or interfering with signal transduction. for example, in tlr <dig> a snp outside of the extracellular region was found to impair receptor signalling  <cit> . also a polymorphism in the transmembrane region of human tlr <dig> is found to regulate the innate immune response indicating that the transmembrane region plays a role in function  <cit> .

site-specific co-incidence of adaptive codons  and detection of snps suggests that adaptive evolution within these regions is on-going. a good example is codon a <dig>  which is identified as evolving under positive selection across the mammalian phylogeny and also three non synonymous snps  that were found in this codon. snps detected at these positions in both sheep and cattle argues against a <dig> variation being stochastic but is likely to convey an advantage. a previous study of bovine tlr <dig> snps surmised that this site may be of functional significance   <cit> . this finding was supported using the sift program which predicts the functional relevance of snps by comparison of conservation at that site  <cit> . we used the same approach to confirm this result but found that the snp is now predicted to be a tolerated replacement. this conflict in results suggests caution when solely relying on algorithmic methods to predict putative sites of functional relevance. however, secondary structure analysis on bovine tlr <dig> revealed this snp is predicted to alter the alpha helix structure . this suggests that this amino acid site may indeed be of functional significance.

as expected, we found the internal signaling tir domain to have evolved predominantly under purifying selection. in cattle a single codon  was predicted as evolving subject to adaptive evolution. this positively-selected site is close to the bb-loop which is predicted to be involved in tlr dimerization and adaptor protein recognition  <cit> .

of the  <dig> breeds investigated in our study two breeds were found to have no detectable snps in tlr <dig>  the soay sheep breed was found to be homozygous in the  <dig> individuals analysed. the soay breed is a primitive domestic breed which was introduced to soay island of the st. kilda archipelago in the outer hebrides of northern scotland. this breed has experienced expansive population growth followed by seasonal periods of population crashes thought to be associated with parasitic helminth disease  <cit> . our results indicate that this breed may have lost heterozygosity within tlr <dig>  this raises the possibility that opportunistic bacterial infections may occur due to a poor tlr <dig> repertoire in this breed. however, sampling of a larger sample set for this breed should be carried out to verify this result.

four cattle breeds  included in this study were bos indicus subspecies and were found to contain a higher proportion of the total number of non-synonymous snps along with all, except two, of the total number of synonymous snps  suggesting that the snps are evolutionarily recent events following the divergence of bos indicus and bos taurus   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that in agreement with other studies, positive selection is acting on mammalian tlr <dig>  however, our analyses have revealed that the domesticated species in the artiodactyl clade have undergone detectable diversifying selection compared with the rest of the mammals. with the ubiquity of bacterial infection why should the ungulate clade be different to the rest of the mammals? we suggest that artificial selection may have accelerated the evolutionary process resulting in positive selective pressure driving adaptation of the tlr <dig> gene. the nature of this selection is not known but may be due to selection for cattle resistant to bacteria during domestication or due to an increased bacterial load due to maintaining animals in closer groups and promoting bacterial infection. the concentration of positively-selected sites in close proximity to the conserved cavity of the protein supports the hypothesis that on-going competition is a driving force shaping both the bacterial flagellin and host tlr <dig> genes.
