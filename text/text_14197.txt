BACKGROUND
knowledge of molecular mechanisms of flowering and maturity is important for understanding the phenology of seed crops and for maximizing yield in a given environment. on the basis of knowledge accumulated for arabidopsis thaliana, the molecular mechanisms of flowering have been studied in many crops. these studies have revealed common important genes, such as flowering locus t  and constans , but also their functional divergence and diversity of genetic mechanisms underlying the natural variation of flowering time within species .

soybean  merrill) is a facultative short-day plant. rich genetic variability in photoperiod responses enables the crop to adapt to a wide range of latitudes. this wide adaptability has been created by natural variations in a number of major genes and quantitative trait loci  that control flowering  <cit> . ten major genes have been identified so far to control time to flowering and maturity in soybean: e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , e <dig>  <cit> , and j  <cit> . dominant alleles at e <dig>  e <dig>  and j promote early flowering, whereas dominant alleles at other loci delay flowering and maturity. e <dig> and j have been identified in the progeny of crosses between standard and late-flowering cultivars with a long-juvenile habit, which causes late flowering under short days  <cit> . e <dig> has been identified through the molecular dissection of a qtl for early flowering introduced from a wild soybean accession  <cit> . molecular mechanisms that involve four of the ten genes  have been identified. e <dig> encodes a possible transcription factor down-regulating ft2a and ft5a   <cit>  and has the most marked effect on flowering time . e <dig> is an ortholog of arabidopsis gigantea   <cit> . e <dig> and e <dig> encode the phytochrome a isoforms, gmphya <dig> and gmphya <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

the soybean genome has at least ten ft homologs, among which six promote flowering of the arabidopsis ft mutant or ecotype columbia  when ectopically expressed . their expression profiles differ depending on tissues and growth stages, suggesting their subfunctionalization in soybean flowering . among the six homologs, ft2a and ft5a have been extensively studied , because their expression patterns closely follow photoperiodic changes  <cit>  and their overexpression promotes flowering even under non-inductive conditions  <cit> . the photoperiodic expression patterns of ft2a and ft5a are most likely controlled by e <dig> and its homologs, e1la and e1lb, which in turn are under the control of e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . e <dig> inhibits ft2a expression possibly through a pathway different from the e1–phya pathway  <cit> .

allelic variations at e1–e <dig> generate some but not all of the variation in flowering time among soybean cultivars  <cit> . various combinations of mutations that occur independently at e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> lead to insensitivity or low sensitivity of flowering to photoperiod  <cit> . besides the above four genes, a number of soybean orthologs of arabidopsis flowering genes have been characterized: col   <cit> , cry   <cit> , fkf <dig>  <cit> , fld   <cit> , ful   <cit> , rav-like   <cit> , soc1/agl <dig>   <cit> , target of eat <dig>   <cit> , and ztl   <cit> . a genome-wide association study also revealed a number of snps that were significantly associated with flowering time; some of these snps implied an involvement of orthologs to arabidopsis flowering genes, such as early flowering  <dig> and soc <dig> or agamous-like  <dig>  in the control of flowering time in soybean  <cit> . however, our understanding of the roles of these orthologs in the natural variation of flowering in soybean is still limited. jiang et al.  <cit>  found diverse sequence variations in the ft2a promoter region among soybean cultivars, despite the coding region being highly conserved. although some of these polymorphisms are significantly associated with variation in flowering time among the cultivars tested, their roles in ft2a expression is not fully understood  <cit> .

in this study, using a cross between early-maturing cultivars of different origins, we found that segregation of flowering time was partly associated with a tagging marker of the maturity gene e <dig>  we demonstrate that e <dig> is identical to ft2a, and its recessive allele has an insertion of the ty1/copia-like retrotransposon in the first intron, which reduces the ft2a transcript level and delays flowering.

RESULTS
segregation of flowering time in the progeny of a cross between harosoy and toyomusume
two early-maturing cultivars, a canadian cultivar, harosoy , and a japanese cultivar, toyomusume , were used in the crossing. they have the same maturity genotypes at e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> , but differ in the e <dig> genotype: ha has a hypomorphic e1-as allele, whereas to has an e1-nl allele, which lacks the genomic region  containing the entire e <dig> gene  <cit> . to and ha flowered almost at the same time under natural daylength conditions in sapporo, japan , although the former flowered  <dig> to 5 days earlier than the latter. however, flowering times in the f <dig> population varied widely . since the allelic variation at e <dig> has a large effect on flowering time, we first evaluated the effects of e <dig> alleles on flowering time in the population. we determined the e <dig> genotypes of f <dig> plants with an allele-specific dna marker  <cit>  and flanking simple sequence repeat  markers  <cit> . as expected, plants homozygous for e1-nl  flowered, on average, 11 days earlier than those homozygous for e1-as  . since plants homozygous for each allele still varied considerably in flowering time, we carried out the progeny test for  <dig> plants homozygous for each allele. flowering times of f <dig> individuals were closely correlated with the average flowering times of their progeny . parent–offspring correlation coefficients were  <dig>  for the e1-nl homozygote and  <dig>  for the e1-as homozygote, suggesting that a genetic factor other than e <dig> segregated in each of the two genotypic classes.fig.  <dig> flowering time in the progeny of the cross between toyomusume and harosoy. a frequency distribution of flowering time in f <dig>  b scatter diagram of flowering time in f <dig> and f <dig> progeny. averages and standard deviations of flowering time for toyomusume  and harosoy  are shown



test for association between flowering time and ssr markers
to detect flowering genes that segregated independently of e <dig>  we tested flowering time–ssr marker association in each of the e1-nl and e1-as genotypic classes; we used  <dig> ssr markers located in the genomic regions where orthologs to arabidopsis flowering genes are clustered  <cit> . two markers were significantly associated with flowering time in e1-nl homozygotes and five in e1-as homozygotes . plants homozygous for the to alleles  at all loci except sat <dig> flowered later than those homozygous for the ha alleles . only sat_ <dig> showed significant associations in both e1-nl and e1-as genotypic classes. sat_ <dig> was located near the ssr marker satt <dig> on lg j, which is a tagging marker for the e <dig> gene identified in a cross between cultivated  and wild  soybeans  <cit> . because to is a parent of tk <dig>  <cit> , which carries the recessive e <dig> allele  <cit> , it is plausible that the gene tagged by sat_ <dig> is identical to e <dig> and that to has the same recessive allele for late flowering as tk <dig> table  <dig> association tests of ssr marker genotypes with flowering time

fine-mapping and association analysis
for fine-mapping of the e <dig> gene, a total of  <dig> seeds from two heterozygous f <dig> plants derived from the same f <dig> family  were genotyped for the ssr markers sat_ <dig> and barcsoyssr_16_ <dig>  we detected eight recombinants  in the flanking region, which were genotyped for seven additional ssr markers and three insertion/deletion  markers  used in the identification of e <dig>  <cit> . the genotype at e <dig> was estimated from the segregation pattern in the progeny test . among the four plants derived from one f <dig> parent, two plants  flowered early and one  flowered late, whereas plant # <dig> segregated for flowering time. among the four plants derived from the other f <dig> parent, two plants  flowered early and one  flowered late, whereas one plant  segregated. by comparing the graphical genotypes and estimated e <dig> genotypes, we delimited the qtl to a  <dig> -kb region between markers barcsoyssr_16_ <dig> and barcsoyssr_16_ <dig>  in which only the id <dig> marker completely co-segregated with the genotype at e <dig> fig.  <dig> fine mapping of the e <dig> locus and annotated genes in the delimited genomic region. a eight recombinants  in the region between sat_ <dig> and barcsoyssr_16_ <dig> were genotyped at  <dig> barcsoyssr  and  <dig> indel markers . the genotype at e <dig> was estimated by progeny testing. the ranges , averages , and standard deviations  of flowering time  are indicated. b three annotated genes in a delimited genomic region



to confirm co-segregation between flowering time and id <dig> genotype, we examined 14 f <dig> families homozygous for e1-nl and  <dig> homozygous for e1-as . among the e1-nl families, plants of two families homozygous for the to allele flowered late, whereas plants of two families homozygous for the ha allele flowered early. a highly significant association between flowering time and marker genotypes was observed in the  <dig> heterozygous families. similarly, a highly significant association was detected between flowering time and marker genotypes in the  <dig> heterozygous families with the e1-as genotype. therefore, the variation in flowering time in each f <dig> family could be mostly accounted for by the genotypes at the id <dig> marker.table  <dig> association tests of id <dig>  a tagging marker of e <dig>  with flowering time

cdna sequencing and expression analysis
according to the williams  <dig> reference genome sequence  <cit> , the region delimited by fine mapping contained three genes: glyma.16 g <dig> , glyma.16 g <dig> , and glyma.16 g <dig>  . we focused on ft2a as a candidate for e <dig> because of its importance in floral induction in soybean . cdna sequence analysis was carried out for ha and to, the japanese cultivar hayahikari , and the parents  of the recombinant inbred line  population used for the identification of e <dig>  <cit> . there were no nucleotide substitutions in their coding regions, which were identical to that of williams 82; a snp  after the stop codon was identified between ha and to or hy. we then compared the expression profiles of ft2a under short day  and long day  conditions in plants homozygous for the to allele and those homozygous for the ha allele at id <dig> in the progeny of 10 f <dig> families with the e1-nl/e1-nl genotype that segregated for e <dig>  the ft2a transcript abundance was analyzed at zeitgeber time  <dig>  in all tested families, plants with the ha allele had higher ft2a expression than plants with the to allele, regardless of daylength, although the expression was much higher in sd than ld in both homozygotes . the lower expression of ft2a in plants with the to allele was further confirmed in the diurnal expression patterns in to and ha: the expression levels of to were very low across any sampling times compared with that of ha . thus, late flowering in plants homozygous for the to allele at id <dig> was tightly associated with reduced ft2a expression.fig.  <dig>

sequence analysis of the ft2a genomic region
in arabidopsis, ft is regulated by various transcription factors, which bind to the promoter or to the first intron and 3′ downstream region  <cit> . to detect the cause of the reduced ft2a expression, we first sequenced the 5′-upstream region of ft2a in the three cultivars and in tk <dig> and hidaka  <dig>  we detected  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels. the sequences of to and tk <dig> were identical to each other, but differed from those of ha and hidaka  <dig> in a 43-bp indel in the promoter and a 10-bp indel in the 5′ utr, which were located  <dig> and 47 bp upstream of the start codon, respectively, and in two snps  . the sequence of hy was similar to those of to and tk <dig> , but differed from them in one snp , a 4-bp indel 274 bp upstream of the start codon, and the 10-bp indel in the 5′ utr.

we also sequenced the introns and the 3′-downstream region in to, ha, and hy to test whether the polymorphism observed in the promoter and 5′ utr could be responsible for late flowering in to. the primers based on the gene model glyma.16 g <dig> worked well for pcr amplification of these regions except for the first intron of to. to sequence the first intron in to, we used genome walking. nested pcr analysis of genomic libraries produced an amplicon of 370 bp from the library constructed by using ecorv. sequencing revealed that it consisted of an unknown sequence of 137-bp fused with a 233-bp segment of the first intron of ft2a proximal to the second exon. a blast search of the ncbi genome database showed that the former sequence was identical to a part of an ltr of sore- <dig> , which has been previously detected in a recessive allele at the e <dig> locus  <cit> . the inserted retrotransposon and its flanking regions were then amplified by nested pcr and sequenced. the retrotransposon was  <dig>  bp long; its sequence was 100 % identical to the ltrs of sore- <dig> and  <dig>  % identical to its coding region. using a dna marker for the sore- <dig> detection, we confirmed that tk <dig> also had sore- <dig> in the first intron, but hidaka  <dig>  ha, and hy did not. we detected a total of  <dig> polymorphisms  from the first intron to 3′ downstream regions among the three cultivars .

thus, three early-maturing cultivars—to, ha, and hy—had different ft2a sequences, which were designated as the ft2a-to, ft2a-ha, and ft2a-hy alleles. ft2a-to differed from both ft2a-ha and ft2a-hy in the 10-bp deletion in the 5′ utr, and in snp # <dig> and the sore- <dig> insertion in intron  <dig> . by using the database of plant cis-acting regulatory dna elements   <cit> , we detected a w-box element  that was created by snp # <dig> in to, and two cis-elements, rbcsconsensus  and arr1at , in the genomic region flanking the sore- <dig> integration site.fig.  <dig> dna polymorphisms that discriminate between the ft2a alleles and ft2a transcript abundance in their nils. a genomic positions and types of three dna polymorphisms between toyomusume  and both harosoy  and hayahikari  b

expression of different ft2a alleles in near-isogenic lines and photoperiod-insensitive accessions
we developed four sets of nils for the above three ft2a alleles from the progeny of f <dig> heterozygous plants: two from the cross between to and ha  and two from the cross between to and hy . we found that, under sd conditions, ft2a-to expression was much lower than that of ft2a-ha and ft2a-hy .

using  <dig> markers, we selected five photoperiod-insensitive e <dig> e <dig> cultivars, all of which had the 10-bp deletion in 5′ utr, but differed in snp # <dig> and in the presence or absence of sore- <dig> . we analyzed ft2a expression in fully-expanded trifoliate leaves at different leaf stages  . ft2a expression was markedly low in all stages in karafuto  <dig>  but was relatively high in the other four. because karafuto  <dig> differed from the other cultivars only in the presence of sore- <dig>  low expression of ft2a-to was caused by the insertion of sore- <dig>  not by the 10-bp deletion or by snp # <dig> fig.  <dig>

rna processing and dna methylation at the ft2a locus
transposable elements  in introns often affect chromatin structure and modify rna processing of the host gene and, therefore, influence its expression patterns . using qrt-pcr on cdna synthesized with random primers, which targeted different regions, we analyzed ft2a expression in two sets of nils for ft2a-to and ft2a-hy grown in sd. in all three targeted regions , the ft2a transcript abundance was considerably lower  in nils for ft2a-to than in nils for ft2a-hy .fig.  <dig>

to analyze ft2a rna processing in ft2a-to, we performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr on cdnas synthesized with random primers. no amplicon was detected in regions a , b and c , or d and e , although the expected amplicons were observed in pcr on genomic dna of the nil for ft2a-to . for region f , a fragment  was amplified in both nils, although signal intensity was much higher in the nil for ft2a-hy than in the nil for ft2a-to; as expected, genomic pcr produced fragments of  <dig>  bp in the nil for ft2a-to and  <dig>  bp in the nil for ft2a-hy . these results suggest that intron  <dig> with the sore- <dig> insertion could be spliced out in the nil for ft2a-to.fig.  <dig>

next, we examined ft2a expression in heterozygous siblings of nils; this analysis was based on the fact that snp # <dig> after the stop codon  created a ddei restriction site in ft2a-ha, but not in ft2a-to and ft2a-hy. by performing rt-pcr and digesting the product with ddei, expression of ft2a-to can be distinguished from that of ft2a-ha in heterozygous plants. in the nils-# <dig> for ft2a-to and ft2a-ha, and its siblings, the ft2a transcript level was high in homozygotes for ft2a-ha, slightly lower in heterozygotes, and very low in homozygotes for ft2a-to . digestion of pcr products revealed that in heterozygotes, the transcript level of ft2a-ha was much higher than that of ft2a-to. this difference suggests that the lower expression of ft2a-to was caused by allele-specific transcriptional repression rather than sequence-specific rna degradation of rna silencing that decreases the levels of transcripts from both alleles.fig.  <dig> transcript abundance of different alleles and dna methylation in the ft2a genomic region. a transcript abundance of different ft2a alleles assayed by allele-specific restriction digestion. b diagram of the ft2a genomic region showing the position of sore- <dig> insertion. amplicons were analyzed by semi-quantitative pcr after mcrbc or mock digestion; the amplified regions are designated as a to k and s <dig> to s <dig>  exons, white; utrs, black; ltrs of sore- <dig>  gray. c genomic dna from leaves of 20-day-old plants of nils for ft2a-to  and ft2a-hy  grown under sd conditions was digested with mcrbc  or mock-digested  and amplified by pcr. amplicons were visualized in agarose gels



we also evaluated the methylation of ft2a-to and ft2a-hy. methylation-dependent mcrbc restriction digestions and mock digestions of genomic dna were used to analyze cytosine methylation in nils for ft2a-to and ft2a-hy. semi-quantitative pcr was performed using primers designed for each of the targeted regions to be singly amplified . there was no difference in pcr amplification of genomic regions a–f and h–k in the mcrbc-digested and mock-digested samples in both nils . in contrast, no amplicons were detected for regions s1–s <dig>  after mcrbc digestion in the nil for ft2a-to, although fragments of expected sizes were amplified from mock-digested dna. pcr on both mcrbc-digested and mock-digested dnas produced the expected amplicons in region s <dig>  of the nil for ft2a-to and in genomic region g  of the nil for ft2a-hy. taken together, these data indicate that sore- <dig> was highly methylated, but methylation appeared not to extend to the ft2a genomic region flanking sore- <dig>  the same result was obtained for plants grown in ld , which indicates that lower mrna level of ft2a-to is associated with sore- <dig> methylation in both sd and ld conditions.

discussion
maturity gene e <dig> is ft2a
flowering time in the f <dig> and f <dig> progeny of a cross between to and ha co-segregated with the alleles at the e <dig> and e <dig> loci. fine mapping delimited e <dig> to a  <dig> -kb region that contained three genes, including ft2a, a soybean ortholog of ft . sequencing and expression analysis suggested that ft2a is the most likely candidate for e <dig>  and delayed flowering due to e <dig> is most likely caused by the reduced ft2a transcript abundance. despite sequence identity in the coding regions, we detected several snps and indels of 4–43 bp in the promoter and 5′ utr among cultivars and accessions tested; this is consistent with a previous report  <cit> . however, expression analysis of nils and photoperiod-insensitive accessions carrying different ft2a alleles revealed that the polymorphisms in the promoter and 5′ utr were not responsible for different ft2a expression levels . to also differed from ha and hy by a snp and a sore- <dig> insertion in the first intron, of which the latter was solely associated with the ft2a expression levels . thus, our study reveals that the insertion of sore- <dig> attenuated ft2a expression and delayed flowering. the soybean genome possesses a total of ten ft orthologs, among which six retain the ft function and can promote flowering of arabidopsis ft mutants  <cit>  or col- <dig>  <cit> . all of the six homologs could therefore function as potential floral inducers in soybean, although only two of them, ft2a and ft5a, have been extensively characterized in studies of molecular mechanisms of flowering . this study demonstrates that different levels of ft2a expression directly regulate natural variation in flowering time in soybean.

factors responsible for attenuation of ft2a expression
plant tes inserted in introns may affect rna processing  <cit>  and render their host genes susceptible to short interfering rna -mediated silencing  <cit> . our results show that the first intron  is spliced out, because no primary rna transcripts that would cover ft2a exons and sore- <dig> were detected while the spliced products were detected . thus, sore- <dig> insertion did not markedly interfere with ft2a rna processing.

we found that the reduction in ft2a-to transcript abundance was caused by allele-specific transcriptional repression due to the insertion of sore- <dig>  the ltrs and adjacent sequences of which were highly methylated . therefore, epigenetic mechanisms likely account for the reduction in ft2a-to transcript levels. rna-directed dna methylation or the resulting chromatin modifications regulate gene expression by interfering with transcription factor binding, leading to different expression profiles for different transcription factors . place analysis detected two cis-elements, rbcsconsensus and arr1at, in the region flanking the sore- <dig> integration site in the first intron. however, the functions of the two elements in ft2a expression are unclear. a further test is thus needed to determine the functions of the two cis-elements or nearby unknown elements in the regulation of ft2a expression and whether sore- <dig> insertion interrupts binding of a transcriptional factor to these cis-elements.

methylation-mediated gene repression by intronic tes is well characterized in arabidopsis flowering locus c , which encodes a transcription factor containing a mads domain that inhibits ft expression  <cit> . in col- <dig>  the functional flc allele is highly expressed in the presence of frigida and causes extremely late flowering  <cit> . in contrast, in ecotype landsberg erecta , the flc allele has a  <dig> -bp non-autonomous mutator-like te in intron  <dig> and is expressed at low levels due to its transcriptional silencing through histone h3-k <dig> methylation, which is triggered by sirna generated from homologous tes  <cit> . flc-ler, however, can still be regulated by genes in the autonomous flowering pathway and by genes involved in vernalization, because the te insertion does not affect the transcription factor–binding sites in intron  <dig>  <cit> . similarly to the flc-ler allele, the expression of ft2a-to is repressed due to epigenetic modification caused by the insertion of sore- <dig> in intron  <dig>  however, ft2a-to expression was still higher in sd than in ld . virus-induced silencing of e1-like genes  lowers photoperiod sensitivity of to by up-regulating the expression of both ft2a and ft5a  <cit> . the regulation of ft2a expression by e1-like and other genes involved in photoperiod responses is thus retained in ft2a-to plants. the ft2a-to allele may thus be involved in flowering as a leaky allele, not a dysfunctional allele.

origin and adaptive role of the e <dig> allele
sore- <dig> was first detected in a recessive allele at the e <dig> locus encoding phytochrome a; its insertion in the first exon caused a premature stop codon and resulted in a dysfunctional truncated protein  <cit> . dna marker analysis revealed that the e <dig> allele with the sore- <dig> insertion is present mainly in landraces from northern japan  <cit> , although it has been used in breeding of photoperiod-insensitive cultivars in high-latitude regions of other countries  <cit> . this insertion in the e <dig> gene may thus have played an adaptive role in expanding the areas of soybean cultivation to higher latitudes. our preliminary survey of the insertion of sore- <dig> in the ft2a allele suggests that ft2a-to is a region-specific allele detected in only a few local varieties established in sakhalin and northern hokkaido among photoperiod-insensitive landraces and cultivars having the e <dig> allele with the sore- <dig> insertion. therefore, the insertion of sore- <dig> in the first intron of ft2a-to may be of recent origin.

our preliminary survey also suggests that the cultivar toshidai- <dig>  introduced from sakhalin with karafuto  <dig>  was the source of the ft2a allele with the sore- <dig> insertion in to  <cit> . similar to to, both toshidai- <dig> and karafuto  <dig> have a null allele at the e <dig> locus, but, unlike to, they have recessive alleles at e <dig> and e <dig> . this is a maturity genotype that permits extremely early flowering and maturation and enables seed production in cold climates with a limited frost-free season. because ft2a and ft5a control flowering redundantly  <cit> , the e <dig>  allele could have been selected in the presence of functional ft5a because it maintains vegetative growth. it is thus another example of the adaptive role of sore- <dig> insertion as indicated by kanazawa et al.  <cit> . the e <dig> allele may also be useful for developing cultivars adapted to a shorter photoperiod in low-latitude environments where flowering is strongly promoted. in such environments, a longer vegetative phase, a so-called long-juvenile trait, is desirable. a leaky allele similar to e <dig> may be useful for reducing the transcript levels of ft2a under sd conditions, in addition to long-juvenile genes reported so far, such as e <dig>  <cit>  and j  <cit> . a further study is needed to evaluate the adaptive significance of e <dig> under sd conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study revealed that the soybean maturity gene e <dig> is ft2a, an ortholog of arabidopsis ft, and that its recessive allele delays flowering through lower transcript abundance. ft2a is thus directly involved in the natural variation in flowering time in soybean. the attenuation of ft2a expression is caused by allele-specific transcriptional repression caused by the insertion of sore- <dig> in the first intron. the recessive e <dig> allele is a leaky allele; its regulation by other genes involved in photoperiod response is retained. it may thus maintain vegetative growth in early-flowering genetic backgrounds, and also be useful as a long-juvenile allele in cultivar development in low-latitude regions, where flowering is strongly promoted.
