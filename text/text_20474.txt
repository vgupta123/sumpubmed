BACKGROUND
suicide is the eleventh leading cause of death for all americans with an age-adjusted annual rate of  <dig>  per  <dig>  in  <dig>  <cit> . more than 90% of suicide completers have a psychiatric disorder and mood related disorders are the most common disease associated with suicide  <cit> . patients suffering with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have greatly increased rates of suicide with approximately 10% of patients dying of suicide  <cit> . bipolar disorder and schizophrenia share common risk factors for suicide completion such as depression, previous suicide attempts, hopelessness, substance abuse, agitation, and poor adherence to treatment  <cit> . suicide is a complex endpoint with many factors and pathways leading to death  <cit> . the hypothesis of a shared causation for suicide suggests common pathways and genes may function as susceptibility factors in both disorders. alternatively, there could be specific distinct pathways within a diagnostic group.

microarray technology provides an unbiased approach to the molecular causes of psychiatric disorders by examining the gene expression profile of cases vs. controls  <cit> . recent microarray studies identified differentially expressed genes between suicide and depression patients vs. normal controls  <cit> . however, due to the small magnitude of the differential gene expression, the genetic heterogeneity of these mental disorders, and the mixed cellular nature of the brain tissue available  <cit> , microarray studies with small sample sizes are prone to generate many false positive results  <cit> . analysis of larger data sets pooled from independent studies increase the statistical power to find differentially expressed genes with small effect sizes in microarray studies. recently, a large microarray data set generated by the stanley medical research institute has become available online   <cit> . this database contains clinical information and microarray data from  <dig> independent studies with post-mortem brain tissues of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and unaffected control cohorts  <cit> . in this study, we reanalyzed this large microarray data set of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients. the question posed is, "to what extent are differentially expressed genes for suicide specific to diagnosis  vs. a shared common pathway?"

RESULTS
suicide candidate genes in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia
chi square tests of association indicated no difference in demographic variables between suicide vs. non-suicide subgroups within bipolar disorder. in contrast, age and smoking showed significant differences with suicide vs. non-suicide in the schizophrenia subgroup. also, brain ph and sex significantly affected the expression levels of the differentially expressed genes between suicide vs. non-suicide groups within schizophrenia . as shown in table  <dig>  none of these variables met the two criteria for inclusion as covariates in the two disorders . therefore, we used no covariates in the omnibus model to provide a generalizable, single, same model for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. between the suicide vs. non-suicide groups within bipolar disorder, a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed . among these genes,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes including gamma-amino butyric acid a receptor, α <dig> subunit  were up-regulated.

between the suicide vs. non-suicide group within schizophrenia,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed . most of these genes were down-regulated. from the above lists of differentially expressed genes, within diagnostic groups, two genes overlapped . specifically, the phospholipid scramblase  <dig>  and empty spiracles homolog  <dig>  drosophila  genes were down-regulated in both suicide groups compared to the non-suicide groups. as negative controls, the normalization control probe set of  <dig> genes were tested by the same anova model, and no genes met our statistical criteria  between the suicide group vs. non-suicide group within bipolar or schizophrenia diagnostic categories.

real time-pcr  tested the validity of these two shared, differentially expressed genes in the available subset of the microarrayed samples. in the schizophrenia suicide group, the emx <dig> and plscr <dig> expression levels were significantly down-regulated by comparison of mean expression levels  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; plscr <dig> t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) in the suicide group compared to the non-suicide group . the estimated fold changes in the suicide group were - <dig>  for emx <dig> and - <dig>  for plscr <dig> relative to the non-suicide group. these differences were consistent with our microarray data. however, in bipolar disorder, these two genes could not be validated in a subset of tissues available from the original microarray study patients . these results highlight the overall findings that few common differentially genes for suicide vs. non-suicide exist between diagnostic groups.

biological process in the differentially expressed genes
functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes by gene ontology indicated that  <dig> biological processes were significantly overrepresented  among the suicide candidate genes in the schizophrenia cohort . the transport genes were the most commonly over-represented biological process in our suicide candidate gene list for schizophrenia, including the glial, high affinity, glutamate transporter . in contrast, no significantly over-represented biological process group emerged with suicide candidate genes in the bipolar disorder group.

additionally, we analyzed the list of differentially expressed genes for each diagnosis by the ingenuity pathways analysis  software to identify biological pathways and networks. we identified distinct signaling networks from suicide candidate genes that included the emx <dig> gene in both disorders . in bipolar disorder, the pathway perspective suggested a signaling network related to both cellular movement and cell to cell signaling, with interactions encompassing  <dig> differentially expressed, suicide candidate genes . by contrast, in schizophrenia patients, the differentially expressed genes were related in a cell death signaling network .

discussion
in this re-analysis study, we explored suicide candidate genes associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using an unbiased genome-wide expression profiling strategy. to identify suicide specific effects on the expression level of genes, we compared a suicide completers group to a non-suicide group within the same diagnostic category. the most important finding of this study is the identification of suicide candidate gene lists for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with only two differentially expressed  genes in both bipolar and schizophrenia cohorts namely plscr <dig> and emx <dig> by microarray analysis. the overlap of the two gene lists is small, suggesting few common, shared genes. for schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder, the differential expression of plscr <dig> and emx <dig> was confirmed by rt-pcr. the phospholipid scramblase  is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes ca2+-induced bidirectional movement of phospholipids  <cit> . four isoforms have been cloned, and plscr <dig> was the major isoform expressed in the brain  <cit> . however, the biological role of the plscr <dig> remains unknown. while speculative, the changes in phospholipids membrane composition might have pleiotropic effects as evidence suggests that membrane composition can change g protein coupled receptors' functioning and downstream effector signalling  <cit>  as well as voltage-dependent k+ channels  <cit> . emx <dig> is a homeodomain containing transcription factor, which plays a crucial role in forebrain patterning and development in mouse models  <cit> . this finding suggests a possible neurodevelopmental process whereby variation in forebrain development may be a risk factor for suicide completion behaviour associated with schizophrenia. of note, these differentially expressed genes are neural correlates of suicide and not necessarily causal. they could be epiphenomenon. the questions remain of 1) how these genes function to influence suicide and 2) what intermediate phenotype would be appropriate to demonstrate their possibly causal role.

microarray studies with small sample sizes result in low statistical power and its attendant "noise discovery". this analysis and post-mortem sample size with replicates is noteworthy for an adequately powered sample to detect  <dig>  fold changes, improving sensitivity, reliability, and signal to noise issues.

previous smaller microarray studies have suggested that gabaa receptor subunits and glutamate-related genes were differentially expressed in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well as in suicide completers associated with these disorders  <cit> . we identified the up-regulation of gamma-amino butyric acid a receptor, α <dig>  subunit gene in suicide associated with bipolar disorder, confirming a previous report  <cit> . the expression levels of two glutamate-related genes, glutamate-ammonia ligase  and glial high affinity glutamate transporter member  <dig>  were decreased in suicide completers with schizophrenia. the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems have been suggested to be associated with suicide  <cit> . however, no genes related to these two neurotransmitter systems were identified, consistent with a previous report  <cit> . this negative finding may suggest indirect effects on these neurotransmitter systems.

genetic linkage studies have identified several loci associated with suicidal behaviors in bipolar disorders. significant and suggestive linkages for suicide were mapped on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> from  <dig> bipolar pedigrees  <cit> . among this study's suicide candidate genes associated with bipolar disorder, the tripartite motif-containing  <dig>  gene is located close to the significantly linked d5s <dig> marker on chromosome  <dig>  another large scale genetic linkage study for bipolar disorder using  <dig> individuals identified linkage on chromosome 10q <dig>  for suicide attempts  <cit> . the microarray differentially expressed candidate gene emx <dig> is included in this region of interest. therefore, these two genes may be apt for future genetic association studies for suicide associated with bipolar disorder, proving causation.

while this reanalysis study has the strengths of a larger sample size, independent replicates, and well characterized patient samples from specific areas of cortex, the finding should be interpreted cautiously as this study has some limitations. first, the mixed cellular nature of the brain samples might lower sensitivity due to dilutional effects as opposed to pure neuronal cells of a specific cortical layer  <cit> . in general, most microarray studies with post-mortem brain tissues find fold changes of less than  <dig> fold, including this study. second, although smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse were measured as confounding factors, all possible unmeasured, confounding variables for suicide cannot be formally excluded, such as severity of illness , personality traits, hopelessness, agitation, depressive symptoms, and stress. third, these findings are correlational and not causal. fourth, these gene lists should be considered as provisional until confirmed by replications in independent sets of biological samples.

CONCLUSIONS
by reanalyzing a large microarray dataset, a list of differentially expressed candidate genes for suicide within bipolar disorder or within schizophrenia have been identified. the overlap of genes in common among these two gene lists is small, with a larger number of disorder specific genes being found. this finding suggests that disorder-specific pathways predominate over common pathways at the molecular level. two novel candidate genes, plscr <dig> and emx <dig>  were confirmed as differentially expressed in schizophrenia between suicide completers vs. non-suicide groups.
