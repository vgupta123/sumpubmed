BACKGROUND
lipoxygenases  are nonheme iron-containing enzymes that catalyze the dioxygenation of fatty acids with a  <dig> -pentadiene structure and are ubiquitous among eukaryotes  <cit> . hydroperoxidation products derived from lox enzymes can be further converted into other oxylipins through the activity of diverse enzymes downstream in the pathways, including hydroperoxide lyase , allene oxide synthase, divinyl ether synthase, epoxy alcohol synthase, and peroxygenase  <cit> . these oxylipins include jasmonates, octadecanoids, 6- and 9-carbon aldehydes, oxoacids and divinyl ether fatty acids which are involved in plant defence, senescence, seed germination, plant growth and development.

lox enzymes can be grouped into two types according to their regiospecificity: 9-lox, which specifically forms 9-hydroperoxy fatty acid, and 13-lox, which predominantly catalyzes the formation of 13-hydroperoxy fatty acid. some lox enzymes can produce both 9- and 13-hydroperoxy products. soybeans lox <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have different ph optima and different product specificities  <cit> . lox <dig> has a ph optimum of  <dig> , producing -hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid  as the major product from linoleic acid. lox <dig> with a ph optimum of  <dig>  forms almost equal proportions of 9- and 13-hpods, whereas lox <dig> with a ph optimum of  <dig>  produces approximately 65% and 35% 9- and 13-hpods, respectively  <cit> .

plant loxs have been proposed to form biologically active compounds both during normal developmental stages such as germination or growth as well as during responses to environmental stress such as wounding or pathogen attack  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that 9-lox products in plants play an important role in defence responses. in plants, correlative data suggest that 9-loxs are crucial for lipid peroxidation during the hypersensitive response  <cit> . pathogen-induced 9-lox transcript accumulation has been reported in a number of plants, e.g. in tobacco after infection with phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae  <cit> , in potato infected by phytophthora infestans  <cit> , in almond infected by aspergillus carbonarius  <cit> , and in pepper infected by xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria  <cit> . recently, we also found that endogenous 9-lox activity in n. benthamiana was highly induced by agroinfiltration  <cit> . the strong involvement of 9-lox in the defence of plants has been demonstrated using antisense strategy or virus-induced gene silencing  <cit> . in addition to having a role in defence responses to pathogens, 9-loxs also are implicated in plant developmental processes. a specific 9-lox gene is transiently induced during potato tuber growth, and its antisense suppression resulted in reduced tuber size  <cit> . in arabidopsis, 9-lox has been reported to play an important role in late root development  <cit> . in monocots, maize 9-lox  has been suggested to be highly involved in regulation of development and to act as a susceptibility factor  <cit> .

loxs also have a role in the production of volatile molecules that can positively or negatively influence the flavour and aroma of many plant products  <cit> . volatile c6- and c9-aldehydes, such as hexanal, - and -hexenal, - and -nonenal, as well as - and -nonadienal are products of unsaturated fatty acids metabolized by lox and hpl, and are important components of the aroma and flavour of fruits and vegetables. the sequence starts with the oxygenation of linoleic acid and linolenic acid by 9- or 13-lox to form 9- or 13-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic/octadecatrienoic acids , respectively. the 13-hydroperoxy fatty acids can subsequently be cleaved by 13-hpl into 12-oxo--dodecenoic acid and hexanal or -hexenal, whereas the 9-hydroperoxy fatty acids can be cleaved by 9-hpl into 9-oxononanoic acid and -nonenal or -nonadienal  <cit> . the -aldehydes isomerize either spontaneously or enzymatically catalyzed to their -enal isomers and can be reduced to their corresponding alcohols by alcohol dehydrogenase. due to their organoleptic characteristics, c6-aldehydes and alcohols are often called green notes and are widely used as flavours in foods and beverages  <cit> . besides, -nonenal is considered to be the aged flavour in cereal products, including rice and beer  <cit>  whereas -nonadienal was found to have the greatest fresh cucumber odour impact  <cit> . the isomer -nonenal is used for fresh, tropical, melon notes  <cit> . -nonenal and -nonenal were also identified in cheddar cheese and were found to play an important role on the odour  <cit> . due to their anti-microbial activities, -hexenal, -nonenal and -nonadienal are potential candidates in the control of main mite species in food and feed commodities  <cit> . these compounds can be extracted from plants or synthesized. however, chemical synthesis is not favoured because consumers have a strong preference for natural food additives  <cit> . in addition, extraction is very expensive because of the low abundance of these short-chain aldehydes and alcohols in plants and cannot meet the increasing market demand for natural flavours. for example, the natural green notes market is estimated at 5- <dig> ton year- <dig> and us$  <dig> kg- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, development of a biocatalytic process is required to produce these compounds on a large scale.

hydroxy fatty acids  are multifunctional molecules that have a variety of applications. hfas and their derivatives are used in cosmetics, paints and coatings, lubricants, and the food industry. hfas are also encountered in nature as cyclic esters known as lactones which are used in perfumes and as flavour components in food  <cit> . the most important lactone for flavour application with a market volume of several hundred tons per year is γ-decalactone which is transformed from ricinoleic acid   <cit> . some other examples of hfas used as precursors of flavour compounds are 13-hydroxy-, and 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and 14-hydroxynonadecanoic acid, from which δ-decanolide, γ-dodecanolide, and γ-nonanolide are generated, respectively  <cit> . besides, fatty acids with multiple functional groups can serve as monomers for polymerization and to produce other useful compounds, such as surface active agents  <cit> . fatty acid hydroperoxides, obtained from lox action, can act as precursors for further transformation by chemical reactions for the production of hfas  <cit> . a number of reagents have been used to reduce hydroperoxides into the corresponding hydroxides, such as sncl <dig>  nabh <dig>  koh, and cysteine  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated that 9-lox activity is highly induced in tobacco cells after treating with viral vectors  <cit> . in this study, we have isolated the 9-lox gene from infiltrated n. benthamiana leaves which displayed high 9-lox activity, and expressed it in yeast cells. the biochemical function of nb-9-lox was characterized. the potential biotechnological applications of 9-lox were described.

RESULTS
expression of the nb-9-lox gene is induced by pathogen attack but not by wounding
it has been reported that the expression of lox gene is induced by wounding and pathogen infection  <cit> . in our previous study, we found that 9-lox enzyme activity in n. benthamiana was highly induced by agroinfiltration using a tobacco mosaic virus  based vector system  <cit> . in order to find out the best material for isolation of the 9-lox gene, n. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with a series of mixtures of viral provectors : 1) 3'-provector; 2) 3'-provector and integrase provector; 3) 3'-provector and 5'- provector; 4) 3'-provector, 5'-provector and integrase provector. the infiltrated leaves were harvested after  <dig> days and analyzed. the expression levels of 9-lox were examined in treated n. benthamiana leaves and untreated leaves by real-time pcr using an 18s-26s interspacer gene as an internal control for normalization. as expected, all leaves which were treated with bacterial suspensions showed a much higher expression level of 9-lox than untreated leaves  and leaves infiltrated with buffer   . moreover, the expression of 9-lox was even more induced, when n. benthamiana leaves were co-infiltrated with 3'-provector and 5'-provector together with the integrase provector . these results revealed that the expression of endogenous 9-lox gene in tobacco was more strongly induced by a fully functional rna replicon. lox enzyme activities were also monitored in control and infected leaves by lc-ms . the result showed that 9-hpod was the main product . a very low enzymatic activity was detected in the untreated leaves  and leaves infiltrated with buffer . the 9-lox activities in all infected leaves were significantly higher than those in control leaves. the leaf treated with 3'-provector and 5'-provector together with the integrase provector displayed the highest 9-lox activity. this result coincided with that of real-time pcr analysis.

the effect of wounding on nb-9-lox gene expression was also tested. leaves of n. benthamiana were wounded by infiltration with buffer . the expression level of nb-9-lox was analyzed in n. benthamiana leaves at different times after wounding by real-time pcr. as a result, gene expression of nb-9-lox did not show any significant difference after wounding compared to that after infection with the viral vectors . furthermore, lox activities were measured in untreated leaf, and leaves at different times after wounding by lc-ms. as expected, 9-lox activity did not show any clear difference between untreated and wounded leaves .

cloning and heterologous expression of nb-9-lox in yeast
for cloning of 9-lox gene from n. benthamiana, infiltrated leaves with a fully functional rna replicon which displayed a high lox activity were chosen according to the induction profiles as described above. the full-length cdna of 9-lox gene was isolated using rt-pcr and a set of primers designed on the basis of a tobacco 9-lox gene . the cdna sequence which we obtained from n. benthamiana encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a predicted pi of  <dig> . n. benthamiana lox shows 96% amino acid identity with a previously isolated tobacco 9-lox  <cit> , and is 87% and 84% identical to a tomato lox  and potato tuber lox , respectively. we designated this clone as nb-9-lox.

nb-9-lox was cloned into a pyes <dig> vector for expression in yeast to characterize the enzymatic activity of the encoded protein. the crude protein extracts from yeast cells which were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after galactose induction were separated on a 12% sds-gel. nb-9-lox could already be observed on the sds-gel  <dig> hours after induction . heterologously expressed nb-9-lox was identified by western blot analysis using soybean lox antibody. the results confirmed that nb-9-lox was already expressed  <dig> hours after induction, and its highest level was observed  <dig> hours after induction . lox activity was measured at room temperature by the formation of the conjugated diene at  <dig> nm. the crude protein extracts from yeast cells which were harvested at  <dig> hours after induction displayed the highest lox activity . therefore, nb-9-lox used for all assays was prepared from yeast cell culture harvested at  <dig> hours after induction. under optimal culture condition, about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u lox activity was obtained from crude protein extracted from  <dig> ml yeast cell culture. nb-9-lox-yeast protein extracts prepared from  <dig> ml yeast cell culture could convert  <dig> μmole of linoleic acid into  <dig>  μmole of 9-hpod. the transformation yield was 99% .

the amount of 9-hpod was determined using a standard curve calculated from various known concentrations of 9-hpod against the uv peak areas which were recorded at  <dig> nm by lc-ms. each value is the average and standard error of two replicates.

the enzymatic activity of nb-9-lox was analyzed at different ph values  and temperatures  to find out the optimal catalytic conditions,. the yeast-expressed nb-9-lox enzyme has a temperature optimum at 35°c with linoleic acid as substrate and a ph optimum of  <dig>  with a reproducible slight reduction in activity at ph  <dig> , which is near neutrality and similar to that of other 9-lox enzymes . the km for the substrate linoleic acid was  <dig>  μm .

cloning and heterologous expression of cm-9/13-hpl and cl-13-hpl in yeast
for production of c6- or c9-aldehydes by a coupled lox-hpl reaction, full-length cdnas of 13-hpl from watermelon leaves  and 9/13-hpl from melon fruit  were isolated using rt-pcr and heterologously expressed in yeast. hpl activity was determined by measuring the decrease of a <dig> due to cleavage of the substrate. hpl activities of both cm-9/13-hpl and cl-13-hpl could be detected  <dig> hours after induction, and for both the highest hpl activity was measured  <dig> hours after induction . the activity of cl-13-hpl was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u mg- <dig> of protein with 13-hpod, while that of cm-9/13-hpl was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u mg- <dig> of protein with 9-hpod and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u mg- <dig> of protein with 13-hpod. as described in previous studies, cl-13-hpl has a strong preference for 13-hpods over 9-hpods  <cit> , and cm-9/13-hpl has dual activity on both 9- and 13-hpods  <cit> . cm-9/13-hpl cleaves 13-hpod and 9-hpod with almost the same efficiency.

regiospecificity of nb-9-lox
the positional specificity of nb-9-lox was determined. at first, nb-9-lox was co-assayed with cm-9/13-hpl or cl-13-hpl and the absorbance at  <dig> nm was observed by spectrophotometry. when linoleic acid was incubated with yeast extracts expressing nb-9-lox, the absorbance at  <dig> nm increased rapidly due to the lox-catalyzed formation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. after  <dig> sec, yeast extracts of cl-13-hpl or cm-9/13-hpl were added to the reaction mixture. an immediate decrease in absorption at  <dig> nm  was observed after adding cm-9/13-hpl yeast extracts . in contrast, the addition of cl-13-hpl yeast extracts did not alter absorption at  <dig> nm. this result revealed the regiospecificity of nb-9-lox which specifically forms 9-hpod, a substrate for 9-hpl.

furthermore the reaction products formed by nb-9-lox were identified by lc-ms analysis. ion trace at m/z  <dig> + was monitored to quantify the production of 9-isomer, whereas for 13-isomer m/z  <dig> + was looked at. the result showed that 9-hpod was mainly produced when nb-9-lox-expressed yeast extracts were incubated with linoleic acid. however, 13-hpod was not detectable . under different ph conditions, the product profile was not changed . these results suggested that nb-9-lox is indeed a 9-specific lox.

production of c9-aldehyde in a one-pot process
the one-pot process is a bioprocess in which the lox and hpl reactions take place simultaneously. to evaluate the short-chain aldehyde forming activity in the combinations of nb-9-lox with cl-13-hpl or cm-9/13-hpl, linoleic acid was added to the reaction solutions containing different yeast cell extracts . reaction products were analyzed by spme-gc-ms. low levels of hexanal  , -nonenal  , putative -nonenal   and -nonenal   were detected, when linoleic acid was incubated with the crude enzyme solution containing nb-9-lox in combination with cl-13-hpl. a low level of hexanal was also detected in the reaction mixture containing nb-9-lox in combination with cm-9/13-hpl. however, a large amount of -nonenal, putative -nonenal, and -nonenal was detected in this reaction . reaction mixtures containing only lox or hpl enzymes were devoid of c6- and c9-aldehydes . one milligram of crude cm-9/13-hpl preparation could produce  <dig> ±  <dig> nmol total c9-aldehydes in a reaction mixture containing yeast crude extract expressing nb-9-lox and linoleic acid after  <dig> min . the yield of c9-aldehydes from linoleic acid was 64%.

nb, yeast expressed nb-9-lox; cl, yeast expressed cl-13-hpl; cm, yeast expressed cm-9/13-hpl. the amount of n-hexanal and various nonenal isomers were determined using standard curves calculated from various known concentrations of n-hexanal and -nonenal against the mass peak areas which were recorded by spme-gc-ms, respectively. each value is the average and standard error of three replicates.

the second cleavage product 9-oxo-nonanoic acid formed by 9-hpl activity was analyzed by lc-ms. a large peak in the ion trace m/z  <dig> with a retention time of  <dig>  min was detected in the reaction mixtures with linoleic acid and nb-9-lox in combination with cm-9/13-hpl . the ms/ms spectrum of the pseudomolecular ion - ion  showed characteristic ions m/z  <dig> -, m/z  <dig> -, and m/z  <dig> - , and was putatively identified as 9-oxo-nonanoic acid. no major product was detected in the reactions containing nb-9-lox alone or nb-9-lox in combination with cl-13-hpl .

biocatalytic hydroxylation of linoleic acid with nb-9-lox and cysteine
fatty acids with multiple functional groups can serve as monomers for polymerization and can be employed to produce other useful compounds  <cit> . in this study, we used a convenient and effective reduction step of hydroperoxides developed by elshof et al.  <cit>  to prepare 9-hydroxy- <dig> -octadecadienoic acid . in this system, the enzymatic large-scale preparation of unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides is the first step in the preparation of the corresponding fatty acid hydroxides. a crude extract from yeast cells expressing nb-9-lox was used as the source of lipoxygenase and cysteine as a mild reducing agent, while the primary substrate was linoleic acid . products generated by incubation of linoleic acid and yeast cell extracts expressing nb-9-lox with cysteine were analyzed by lc-ms. we monitored m/z  <dig> + to detect the production of 9-hod, whereas for detection of 9-hpod and linoleic acid m/z  <dig> + and m/z  <dig> - was monitored, respectively. a large peak at m/z  <dig>  was detected when the reaction mixture contained cysteine. although 9-hod and 9-hpod showed almost identical retention times they could clearly be distinguished by their mass spectral data. in contrast, only a tiny amount of 9-hod was detected in the reaction without cysteine . moreover, no remaining linoleic acid was detectable in both reactions.

in order to develop an optimal system for production of 9-hod in a biocatalytic process, a series of experiments was performed. at first, the ratio of substrate/cysteine was tested. linoleic acid  was incubated with nb-9-lox and different concentrations of cysteine:  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm, and  <dig> μm. figure 8a shows that the amount of 9-hod  increased with rising levels of cysteine. the best ratio of substrate/cysteine was 1/ <dig> . a cysteine concentration of more than  <dig> times that of linoleic acid did not increase the production of 9-hod. the reaction time was also tested. when the ratio of substrate:cysteine was 1: <dig>  most 9-hpod was reduced to 9-hod after two hours .

for biocatalytic production of 9-hod, we synchronously added enzyme , linoleic acid , and cysteine  into the bioreactor containing  <dig> mm citrate buffer, ph  <dig> , at 35°c for  <dig> hrs with gentle shaking at  <dig> rpm. the products were then extracted with diethylether and analyzed by lc-ms. the result showed that linoleic acid was completely consumed and most 9-hpod was reduced to 9-hod . under this condition, the yield of 9-hod from linoleic acid was 72% . the total amounts of starting material for the production of  <dig> g of 9-hod are shown in table  <dig>  our system is a very simple batch process, no extensive mixing is required, and no foaming occurs.

discussion
enhancement of lox expression in response to fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogen ingress appears to be a general feature occurring both in monocots and dicots. fournier et al.  <cit>  showed that lox gene expression and activity were induced after root inoculation with zoospores of phytophthora parasitica var. nicotinanae . the purified lox from elicited tobacco cells and infected tobacco plants yielded a single band in sds/page, suggesting that only one lox isoform might be induced by the pathogen and its elicitors. in vitro enzyme assay showed this lox displayed predominance for the 9-lox function  <cit> . furthermore, a previous study for lox gene expression in tobacco cell-suspension cultures and intact plants in response to infection with ppn showed that the lox gene was not constitutively expressed to a detectable level in control cells and healthy plants. in contrast, a rapid and transient accumulation of transcripts occurred in cells and plants after treatment with elicitor and inoculation with zoospores of ppn, respectively  <cit> . in this work, we also demonstrated that both gene expression and enzyme activity of 9-lox were induced in n. benthamiana leaves treated with agrobacterium suspensions which carried tmv-based vectors. 9-lox activity was not induced in the leaves after wounding. however, it was induced in all leaves treated with agrobacterium suspension . lox gene expression and enzyme activity were even more strongly induced when leaves were treated with agrobacterium suspension carrying 3'-provector, 5'-provector and integrase provector which are assembled in the plant cell to form a fully functional infective rna replicon. the fully functional rna replicon is able to replicate autonomously within each infected cell  <cit> . our data indicate that nb-9-lox expression is induced by agrobacterium attack and also by tmv infection. the stimulation of lox activity has also been reported in tobacco after infection with tmv  <cit> . infection with tmv has been suggested to result in localized necrotic lesions in hypersensitively reacting tobacco plants  <cit> . besides, lipid peroxidation analyses in relation with the hypersensitive reaction in cryptogein-elicited tobacco leaves suggested that 9-fatty acid hydroperoxides are responsible for tissue necrosis  <cit> .

three lox genes have been isolated from tobacco nicotiana attenuata, namely nalox <dig>  nalox <dig>  and nalox <dig>  <cit> . nb-9-lox showed  <dig>   <dig>  and 42% amino acid identity with nalox <dig>  nalox <dig>  and nalox <dig>  respectively. we suggest that nb-9-lox has the same function as nalox <dig> because nb-9-lox shows a high amino acid identity with nalox <dig>  the transcripts of both genes were not detectable in untreated leaf and their transcripts were not induced by wounding. furthermore, nalox <dig> expression is also strongly induced by pathogen infection, and is unlikely to be involved in wounding-induced production of jasmonate  <cit> .

the product specificity of nb-9-lox was examined by incubation of linoleic acid and nb-9-lox in combination with cl-13-hpl or cm-9/13-hpl. the reaction products were analyzed by uv-spectrophotometry, lc-ms and spme-gc-ms. figure 4d shows that the absorbance did not decrease when cl-13-hpl was added to the reaction containing nb-9-lox and linoleic acid, indicating that the hydroperoxide produced by nb-9-lox from linoleic acid was not cleaved by cl-13-hpl. in contrast, the addition of cm-9/13-hpl caused a decrease of absorbance. the reaction product formed by incubation of linoleic acid with nb-9-lox was analyzed by lc-ms. 9-hpod was the main hydroperoxide product, while 13-hpod was not detectable . the result from spme-gc-mc showed that low levels of c6-aldehyde and c9-aldehyde were produced during the reaction of linoleic acid with recombinant nb-9-lox in combination with recombinant cl-13-hpl . this result suggested that nb-9-lox functions like 13-lox to some small extent. the low level of 13-hpod was further metabolized into hexanal by cl-13-hpl. as a large amount of 9-hydroperoxide substrates is formed in the reaction, a detectable level of c9-aldehydes can be produced in spite of low activity of cl-13-hpl toward 9-hydroperoxides  <cit> . likewise, the low level of 13-hpod was further metabolized into a small amount of hexanal by cm-9/13-hpl. however, the high level of 9-hydroperoxide was converted into a large amount of c9-aldehydes by cm-9/13-hpl which displayed high 9-hpl activity . the results of spme-gc-ms revealed that nb-9-lox possesses high 9-lox specificity with a tiny share of 13-lox activity, although 13-product was not detected by lc-ms. this result could also explain why a low level of c6-aldehydes and c9-aldehydes were detected when fatty acids were incubated with cl-hpl treated leaf extracts  as described previously  <cit> .

chemical synthesis is the easiest way to produce large amounts of c6- or c9- aldehydes and alcohols. however, for food application, consumers have a strong preference for naturally synthesized additives and aromas. due to the high demand for such natural flavours, many groups have attempted to develop a biocatalytic process to produce these compounds on a large scale. during the past years, enzymatic syntheses using lox and hpl as biocatalysts have become popular for large scale production of c6-aldehydes  <cit> . for this purpose, production of stable lox and hpl with high enzymatic activity is the first step. heterologous gene expression in plants, yeast cells, or bacteria would be an excellent method to increase the availability of lox and hpl for that purpose. different sources of hpls have been explored for industrial production of c6-aldehydes using soybean flour as a source of stable lox. for example, a recombinant alfalfa 13-hpl expressed in e. coli in combination with soybean lox resulted in yields of 50% for hexanal and 26% for hexenal from vegetable oils  <cit> . a combination of watermelon 13-hpl-overexpressing tobacco leaf tissue and soybean lox <dig> yielded 50% of hexenals from linolenic acid  <cit> . a combination of hpl isolated from green bell pepper and soybean lox <dig> isolated from defatted soybean meal resulted in 37% yield for the hexenal isomers from linseed oil  <cit> . in addition, a yield of 60% for -hexenal from linolenic acid was obtained via the combination of a 13-hpl isolated from sugar beet leaves and soybean lox <dig>  <cit> . besides, a combination of watermelon 13-hpl-overexpression tobacco leaf tissues and soybean vlxc expressed in yeast yielded 93% hexanal from linoleic acid  <cit> . however, up to now no study has described the production of c9-aldehydes on a large scale. in this study, we isolated a 9-lox gene responding to pathogen attack from n. benthamiana leaves. we have successfully expressed this lox gene  together with a 9-hpl  in yeast cells. the yeast cells expressed  <dig>  u ml- <dig> and  <dig>  u ml- <dig> cell cultures of stable 9-lox and 9-hpl, respectively. our results showed that the combination of recombinant nb-9-lox and recombinant cm-9/13-hpl could produce large amounts of c9-aldehydes. the yield was 64% for nonenal isomers together from linoleic acid . only a very low level of c6-aldehyde was formed . therefore, this system has potential for producing c <dig> compounds on a large scale.

a number of reagents have been used to reduce hydroperoxides into the corresponding hydroxides  <cit> . however, not all of them are suitable and economically attractive for a biocatalytic process. cysteine is a mild reducing agent which has been used to effectively reduce hydroperoxides into the corresponding hydroxides in a bioprocess  <cit> . based on this, we tried to produce 9-hod using yeast expressed nb-9-lox and cysteine. cell lysates containing 9-lox activity can be easily and rapidly prepared from yeast cells using glass beads. in this system, the enzymatic large-scale preparation of unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides is the first step in the preparation of the corresponding fatty acid hydroxides. large-scale conversion of fatty acids into hydroperoxides by soybean lox has been successfully accomplished  <cit> . in order to obtain high yields of hydroperoxides, some points have to be taken into account: the optimal enzyme/substrate ratio, the substrate concentration, and adequate oxygen supply. at high substrate concentration, fatty acids form aggregates which are not easily dispersible in buffer  <cit> . a low oxygen concentration may eventually lead to an anaerobic reaction resulting in unwanted side-products  <cit> . besides, elshof et al.  <cit>  pointed out that higher conversion yields could be obtained with gradual additions of substrate and enzyme. for obtaining high yields of hydroxides, also the optimal substrate/cysteine ratio and time point of adding of cysteine to the incubation mixture have to be considered  <cit> . in our system, we synchronously added enzyme , linoleic acid, and cysteine into the bioreactor. the dioxygenation of linoleic acids by yeast expressed nb-9-lox resulted in high yields of hydroperoxy fatty acids. the use of the mild reducing agent cysteine makes it simple and efficient to produce 9-hod. the biocatalytic process described here allows rapid and cost-efficient generation of hfas in one experimental step. the procedure is simple because it requires no solvent or surfactant, and is conducted at atmospheric pressure.

CONCLUSIONS
we have isolated a 9-lox gene from n. benthamiana, which is induced by pathogen attack. this lox gene could be expressed in yeast cells in stable and large amounts. it efficiently transforms linoleic acid to 9-hpod. this lox gene can be used to produce c9-aldehydes in combination with a hpl gene with 9-hpl function, or to produce 9-hod in a biocatalytic process in combination with cysteine as a mild reducing agent.
