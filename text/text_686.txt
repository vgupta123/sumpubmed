BACKGROUND
the vertebrate transcriptional activator protein, znf <dig>  operates at a multitude of small rna and protein-coding gene promoters  <cit> . two separable activation domains within this protein stimulate transcription selectively at either small rna or mrna promoters  <cit> . initially, attention was focused on the function of znf <dig> for small rna gene transcription, especially for vertebrate snrna and selenocysteine trna genes  <cit> . then, several mrna genes were identified whose proximal promoters contained sph sites  <cit> . possibly because of the highly degenerate and relatively long dna-binding site recognized by znf <dig>  it was not recognized for many years that approximately  <dig> mammalian protein-coding genes contain sph  elements, or staf binding sites , in their promoters  <cit> .

little is known concerning the phenotypic role of znf <dig> during cellular growth and animal development. a number of cell-cycle-associated gene promoters are regulated by znf <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, znf <dig> is an important regulator of mammalian embryonic stem cell renewal  <cit> . at the molecular level, recent work has demonstrated that this activator protein interacts with the chromodomain-helicase-dna binding protein  <dig> , and implicates that human u <dig> gene transcription is stimulated by znf <dig> through this interaction  <cit> . many potential small rna and protein-coding gene promoters are targeted, but which are most pivotal in vivo?

we used zebrafish embryos as a model system to investigate the role of znf <dig> during vertebrate development. injection of translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides  resulted in a pleiotropic phenotype including axial defects as well as abnormalities in heart, blood, ear and midbrain hindbrain boundary . coinjection of synthetic mrna encoding zebrafish znf <dig> rescued mo-induced defects, and rescue was dependent on the amino-terminal region of the protein containing activation domains. expression levels or patterns of the gata <dig>  cmlc <dig>  and pax2a genes were altered following mo knockdown of zebrafish znf <dig>  the pax2a gene is likely to be a direct target for znf <dig> because this protein binds the promoter in vitro and specific mutations in sph sites resulted in reduced transcription in transient transfection experiments.

RESULTS
identification of mrna gene activation region in znf143
the zebrafish znf <dig> cdna has been identified, and the predicted amino acid sequence contains a high degree of similarity with the human protein   <cit> . furthermore, the zebrafish protein contains highly conserved regions that correspond to the previously identified dna-binding domain , mrna gene activation domain  and small rna gene activation domain of the xenopus and human proteins  <cit>  . to verify the mrna gene activating potential of zebrafish znf <dig> and demarcate boundaries of this region, we fused fragments encoding zebrafish znf <dig> to the s. cerevisiae gal4p dna binding domain , and performed transient transfection assays with such expression plasmids and a firefly luciferase reporter gene transcribed from a minimal promoter driven by gal <dig> binding sites. because transcriptional activating domains of the xenopus protein were localized to the amino-terminal end previously  <cit> , we investigated this region only. amino acids 13- <dig> of zebrafish znf <dig> contains a potent mrna gene activation region that functions in both human embryonic kidney  cells and zebrafish zf <dig> cells . the region including only the four  <dig> aa repeats  was approximately three-fold less active in both cell types. however, it is possible that this difference could be due to a lower expression level of this fragment . importantly, the region of zebrafish znf <dig> between the  <dig> aa repeats and the zinc finger domain  demonstrated minimal mrna promoter activation. within this region has been identified a small rna gene activating domain in the xenopus protein  <cit> .

knockdown of znf <dig> in zebrafish embryos
to begin our studies with zebrafish embryos, we investigated the expression of znf <dig> rna using whole-mount in situ hybridization. this rna was expressed ubiquitously in the early stages that we examined, including 2- <dig> cell stage embryos and through gastrulation stages . znf <dig> rna must be inherited maternally, since it was detected prior to onset of zygotic transcription.

next, we co-injected a pair of morpholino oligonucleotides  that targeted the translational start site and 5' untranslated region  of znf <dig> mrna in order to reduce protein levels during embryonic development. up to nearly 90% of injected embryos exhibited a range of defects at  <dig> hours post fertilization  . microinjection of each individual mo resulted in the same range of phenotypes, but at a much lower efficiency , supporting the assertion that the observed phenotypes are specific to znf <dig> knockdown. no mutant phenotypes were found when a control mo was injected at the same concentration . for quantitation purposes, we sorted the morphant embryos into six classes that are primarily distinguished by increasing severity of axial and other defects. class  <dig> embryos show a distinct kink in the tip of the tail . class  <dig> embryos have the same tail kink and also show disorganization in the somites . class  <dig> embryos have a greater degree of tissue disorganization as well as significant pericardial edema . class  <dig> embryos have the added phenotype of severe brain morphology defects, including absent or poorly formed midbrain-hindbrain boundary  . class  <dig> embryos display the additional phenotype of a considerably shortened axis . class  <dig> morphants  are morphological monsters, lacking both head and tail structures. in addition to the described effects, we also noted reduced blood formation, rate of circulatory flow and abnormal ear development in significant proportions of morphant embryos falling in the more severe classes .

early developmental stages, through most of epiboly, proceeded normally for the znf <dig> morphant embryos, compared to embryos injected with the control mo. however, we detected a delay of approximately  <dig> min to reach bud stage. furthermore, subsequent stages for znf <dig> morphants at 6-somite, 10-somite, 18-somite, and 22-somite were delayed approximately one hour.

in order to verify the specificity of mo-knockdown, we co-injected synthetic mrna encoding zebrafish znf <dig> with the mos to determine whether protein synthesized from the exogenously supplied mrna could rescue the phenotypes. we used mrnas encoding either full length znf <dig> or a truncated variant lacking the transcription activation domains  in our rescue assays. both mrnas lack the normal 5'utr sequence and encode a myc tag at the amino-terminus of the protein, such that the morpholinos will not block their expression. we first confirmed that the full-length myc-tagged protein is functional for transcriptional activation in transfected zf <dig> cells . in addition, the Δ2- <dig> protein was defective for transcriptional activation in transfected zf <dig> cells . we detected nearly equivalent levels of expression of the myc-tagged full-length and Δ2- <dig> proteins in transfected hek <dig> cells . thus, our constructs should be expressed at equivalent levels when expressed in embryos, even though for unknown reasons we have been unable to detect these proteins by their myc-tags in injected embryos and in transfected zf <dig> cells. importantly, when co-injected with the mos, full-length zebrafish znf <dig> rescued the general morphant phenotypes in approximately 70% of the injected embryos, and the remaining defects were primarily the least severe classes . the rescue was dependent on the presence of the amino-terminal region of zebrafish znf <dig> containing both activation domains, since co-injection of mrna lacking codons 2- <dig> did not rescue the morphant phenotypes . these results show that the amino-terminal myc tag does not inactivate the function of zebrafish znf <dig> in vivo, and the observed mo-induced phenotypes are specific to the loss of znf <dig> function and more specifically to znf <dig> transcriptional regulatory capability.

pax2a expression is compromised after znf <dig> knockdown
to determine whether the general morphological defects of znf <dig> morphants could be correlated with specific changes in gene expression, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization to detect developmental gene expression in morphant embryos at several stages. using goosecoid  and orthodenticle homolog  <dig>  probes to monitor prechordal plate mesoderm and neuroectoderm  <cit> , respectively, during gastrulation , we detected no differences between znf <dig> morphants and embryos injected with a control mo . in addition, hindbrain development of rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig> appeared normal during early somitogenesis  using an early growth response 2a  probe  <cit> , although a delay in staining of rhombomere  <dig> was apparent in the 6-somite embryos . this minor variation is consistent with the overall delay detected. furthermore, we examined the expression of myod, a marker for somitic muscle  <cit> . at all stages examined, we detected no discernable difference between wt and znf <dig> morphant embryos . next we analyzed the expression of gata <dig>  a marker for hematopoietic progenitors  <cit> , since blood development is compromised in znf <dig> morphants. at the 16-somite stage, gata <dig> labels populations of hematopoietic progenitors in the posterior mesoderm flanking the midline . consistent with our observation that blood specification is aberrant, znf <dig> morphants exhibited a significant reduction in gata <dig> expression at this stage . at  <dig> hpf, gata <dig> is expressed in cells of the intermediate cell mass , but expression continued to be reduced significantly in znf <dig> morphants . thus, the reduction in blood cells we observed in znf <dig> morphants correlates with a significant reduction in gata <dig> expression that labels hematopoietic progenitors.

we next analyzed expression of cardiac myosin light chain  <dig> , a marker for cardiomyocytes, since heart development appeared disrupted after reduction of znf <dig>  at  <dig> hpf, the heart comprises a tube that loops toward the left side of the embryo . heart progenitors formed normally in znf <dig> depleted embryos, but morphogenesis of the heart was severely compromised in 55% of mo-injected embryos . phenotypic defects varied in this group from a failure to migrate to the left side of the embryo , to a failure in tube morphogenesis . these phenotypic defects in the znf <dig> morphants are not a result of prolonged delay of heart development, because embryos probed for cmlc <dig> expression at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf did not exhibit normal asymmetric looping . at these later stages, 26% displayed cardia bifida .

because znf <dig> morphants displayed morphological abnormalities in the brain, including defects in the mhb, we analyzed the expression of pax2a, a critical regulator of mhb formation. at the 16-somite stage, pax2a expression marks the optic stalks, mid-hindbrain domain, otic vesicles, pronephros and a small number of spinal cord neurons . after reduction of znf <dig> function, pax2a expression was reduced in most expression domains of the majority of embryos . expression of pax2a in the mhb was reduced substantially in znf <dig> morphants, and to a lesser degree, expression in the otic vesicles, and pronephros . in contrast, expression in the optic stalks did not appear to be significantly diminished compared to wt. importantly, this phenotype was rescued by coinjection of wt znf <dig> mrna . at earlier stages  pax2a expression was comparable between znf <dig> morphants and embryos injected with control mo. furthermore, by  <dig> hpf, pax2a expression was not significantly different between wt and znf <dig> morphants, with the exception that pax2a expression in a group of hindbrain neurons was reduced or absent in the morphants . thus, normal pax2a expression, particularly at the mhb, depends on znf <dig> function.

the zebrafish pax2a gene promoter contains binding sites for znf <dig> and is controlled by this protein in transfected cells
since pax2a gene expression was affected after znf <dig> knockdown, we investigated whether this transcription factor might control zebrafish pax2a transcription. visual inspection of the proximal promoter region sequence indicated three possible sph motifs . radiolabeled probes were prepared that contained either the sph <dig> element alone , or both sph <dig> and sph <dig> sites . both probes bound human znf <dig>  showing a single complex that was competed with a specific human u6- <dig> sph oligonucleotide, but not with an unrelated sequence containing the octamer  transcription control element . specific oligonucleotide competition for the pax2a dna fragments was similar to that for the zebrafish u <dig> small nuclear rna gene promoter used as a positive control for these experiments . since only a single complex dependent on addition of a nonsaturating amount of znf <dig> was detected with the - 154/+ <dig> fragment, we suspected that only one of the two potential sph elements was bound. dnasei footprinting was used to determine which sph element in the - 154/+ <dig> fragment was bound by the protein. results from footprinting experiments demonstrated binding of the human znf <dig> dna-binding domain to the sph <dig> element, while the sph <dig> site was unoccupied at concentrations used for the experiment . therefore, two sites  and sph2) within the zebrafish pax2a promoter are bound by znf <dig> in vitro.

next we investigated the transcriptional effect of the sph sites in the zebrafish pax2a promoter in transient transfection experiments. luciferase reporter plasmids containing either the wt pax2a promoter , single sph <dig> or sph <dig> mutants, or the double sph1/ <dig> mutant were added to zebrafish zf <dig> cells. all mutant sites destroyed the highly conserved ccca sequence of a sph element . the efficacy of the sph2mut alteration was demonstrated by the obliteration of the dnasei footprint in vitro . the zebrafish pax2a proximal promoter  was quite active in transfected zf <dig> cells since a typical experiment yielded approximately 7-fold higher normalized firefly luciferase level than from a simple tata box only promoter . in transfected zf <dig> cells, using a synthetic promoter containing multiple sph elements, we found only low, basal activity at the same level as from a promoter lacking sph sites . in human hek <dig> cells the sph <dig> promoter activity is approximately 20-fold higher than from the g <dig> promoter . hence, unlike hek <dig> cells, zf <dig> cells do not contain sufficient amounts of active znf <dig> to stimulate potentially responsive promoters. transcription from the wt pax2a promoter was increased almost two-fold by co-transfection with a znf <dig> expression plasmid . the sph2mut and doubly mutant promoters were not activated, whereas the relative stimulation of transcription from the sph1mut promoter was somewhat reduced . not surprisingly, transcription from the various sphmut pax2a promoters was not reduced significantly in the absence of exogenous znf <dig> . hence the sph <dig> and sph <dig> elements are functional for transcriptional activity directed by the zebrafish pax2a gene promoter.

discussion
in this study, we show that mo-induced knockdown of znf <dig> results in many phenotypic effects during zebrafish development. general defects in tail formation were obvious, but we also noticed abnormal heart, blood, ear and mhb development. the specificity of the mo-induced phenotypes was confirmed by experiments showing phenotypic rescue by the full-length protein but not a truncated variant lacking transcriptional activation domains. in the morphants, expression of gata <dig> , cmlc <dig>  and pax2a  were reduced or altered spatially. furthermore, we found two binding sites for znf <dig> in the zebrafish pax2a gene proximal promoter, and disruption of these sites reduced transcription in transfected zebrafish cells. therefore, one likely mrna gene target for transcriptional control by this protein in vivo is pax2a, although the number is probably much higher.

it is not surprising that a multitude of phenotypes appear after znf <dig> knockdown because many vertebrate small rna genes contain sph sites, and in mammals it has been hypothesized that approximately  <dig> mrna gene promoters contain sph sites  <cit> . it seems likely that the gene encoding znf <dig> is essential for zebrafish viability. the number of promoters containing sph elements in zebrafish is unknown. previously, we have demonstrated an important positive role for the sph site in zebrafish u <dig> snrna gene promoters  <cit> , and have noticed putative sph elements in many zebrafish small rna gene promoters . many fugu small rna gene promoters contain sph sites  <cit> . at present, we do not know which phenotypic effects or the relative severity of those effects caused by znf <dig> knockdown are the result of altered expression of small rna genes or mrna genes. since knockdown was rescued by coinjection of synthetic mrna encoding full-length znf <dig>  but not by rna lacking coding potential for n-terminal activation domains , we hope to be able to distinguish differential effects of mrna-activation vs. small rna activation by this protein using rescue with synthetic rna encoding deletions or mutations in those separable activation functions.

since knockdown of znf <dig> caused relatively drastic phenotypic effects in zebrafish embryos, we were surprised that cultured zebrafish zf <dig> cells contain undetectable levels of endogenous active protein in a transactivation assay . when these same reporter constructs were used in transfected human hek <dig> cells the sph <dig> promoter was transcribed at approximately 20-fold higher level due to endogenous znf <dig>  perhaps a small amount of znf <dig> in zf <dig> cells is sufficient for their growth, and that amount is below a threshold detectable with relatively large amounts of reporter plasmid added in the transfection experiments. indeed, mrna encoding this protein in zf <dig> cells was detected by rt-pcr . another possibility is that relative overexpression of znf <dig> in transfected cells suppresses another defect in the small rna activation pathway in zf <dig> cells. nevertheless, the nonsaturating levels of active znf <dig> in zf <dig> cells allowed us to use them as an assay for mrna activation potential of tagged protein and protein lacking activation domains , and we will use this assay in the future to examine activity of mutant proteins.

our experiments demonstrating brain defects and, specifically, reduced pax2a expression upon znf <dig> knockdown induced us to inspect the pax2a proximal promoter for sph sites. indeed, znf <dig> binds to the pax2a promoter in vitro and activates it in an sph-site dependent manner when cotransfected into zf <dig> cells. although we used existing human znf <dig> protein reagents in our laboratory for the binding studies, rather than the zebrafish protein, we expect that nucleotide specificity of the human and zebrafish proteins should be undistinguishable. the zinc finger dna-binding domains are 91% identical, with no changes in the amino acid residues known to be most important for dna recognition by this motif  <cit> . although the enhancer of the zebrafish pax2a gene promoter have been characterized partially  <cit> , we are not aware of previous work to investigate elements within the proximal promoter. we expect that other elements in addition to the sph <dig> and sph <dig> sites constitute this promoter. luciferase reporter gene activity of the sph1+ <dig> mutant promoter was approximately 7-fold higher than that found with a simple tata-containing promoter in our transient transfection assays . this promoter does not contain a readily identifiable tata box, a characteristic that is true also of most previously identified sph-containing mammalian mrna gene promoters  <cit> . it will be interesting to dissect the pax2a promoter further in order to discern relative roles of sph elements and other elements with respect to both basal transcription and enhancer-driven expression.

because of the widespread abundance of sph sites in mammalian mrna gene promoters, we searched for them in other important developmental regulators in addition to pax2a. although several sph sites appeared to be candidates in the zebrafish gata <dig> proximal promoter, none bound znf <dig> in vitro . on the other hand, we have found a high-affinity sph element in the zebrafish fibroblast growth factor receptor- <dig>  and glycogen synthase kinase 3α promoters . whether any of the aforementioned genes is controlled in a significant manner by znf <dig> will require further study. furthermore, because of the large potential number of target promoters in mammals, it is highly likely that the transcription of many other developmental regulator genes is controlled by znf <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
because knockdown of the transcriptional activator znf <dig> by injection of translational-blocking mos causes many significant phenotypic effects in zebrafish embryos, we conclude that this protein is essential for normal development. phenotypic effects are rescued by coinjection of full-length znf <dig> mrna, but not by mrna lacking coding capacity for the n-terminal region containing activation domains. hence, the mo-mediated knockdown is specific, and znf <dig> function in vivo requires the n-terminal region. furthermore, the pax2a gene promoter is at least one likely target of znf <dig> during zebrafish development.
