BACKGROUND
motility is an important property of bacteria that enables them to move towards favorable growth conditions and away from detrimental conditions. most bacteria move through the use of flagella. a bacterial flagellum consists of three distinct regions: the basal body, the hook, and the filament  <cit> . flagellar assembly and motility are well-understood in enteric bacteria, particularly escherichia coli and salmonella. the flagellar filament of e. coli is a helical arrangement of as many as  <dig>  flagellin subunits, whose molecular weight is approximately  <dig> kda  <cit> . whereas the e. coli flagellar filament consists of one type of flagellin  <cit> , the presence of more than one flagellin type has been reported for a few soil bacteria, including sinorhizobium meliloti, rhizobium lupini, and agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit> . s. meliloti and a. tumefaciens assemble their flagellar filaments from four closely related flagellin subunits  while r. lupini flagella consist of three flagellin subunits . for these soil bacteria, flaa is the principal flagellin subunit of the flagellar filament while the other subunits play minor roles.

the flagellar filament is a highly conserved structure in terms of amino acid composition, subunit domain organization of the flagellin monomers, and the symmetry and mode of assembly  <cit> . the quaternary structure of the flagellar filament has been divided into four structural domains, domain  <dig>  to domain  <dig> , and the amino acid residues of the flagellin protein have been assigned to these domains  <cit> . domains d <dig> and d <dig>  which are found in the filament core, correspond to the amino and carboxy terminal residues. domains d <dig> and d <dig>  the outer region of the filament, consist of the flagellin central residues. the amino acid sequences corresponding to domains  <dig> and  <dig> are highly conserved across different bacterial strains  <cit> , and were shown to be essential in the polymerization of bacterial flagellar filaments  <cit> . domains d <dig> and d <dig>  on the other hand are considerably variable in amino acid composition and are generally not well-aligned  <cit> . domain d <dig> of the filament contributes to filament stability  <cit>  but it can be deleted or reduced in size without severely impairing filament assembly and function  <cit> .

flagellar filaments are traditionally classified as either "plain" or "complex". plain filaments are often found in enterobacteria, such as salmonella typhimurium and e. coli  <cit> . these filaments have a smooth surface and are able to change from left- to right-handedness or from a counterclockwise to a clockwise direction of rotation  <cit> . a few soil bacteria such as pseudomonas rhodos  <cit> , r. lupini  <cit>  and s. meliloti  <cit>  are equipped with one or more complex flagella. studies have shown that transmission electron microscopy can be used to differentiate between plain and complex flagella  <cit> . complex flagellar filaments have a distinct ridging pattern while plain filaments appear thinner and have little to no visible external pattern. the complex filaments are also more rigid and more brittle than the plain filament. it is thought that increased rigidity is favorable for motility in viscous environment such as in the soil biotope  <cit> .

to date, little is known about the flagellar filament of rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae. a previous study has shown that the movement of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain  <dig> is propelled by one or two subpolar flagella  <cit> . the same study has also suggested that the flagella rotate in a unidirectional pattern and the direction of movement is changed by modulating the rotary speed. in this paper, we characterize the genes encoding the seven flagellin subunits in r. leguminosarum bv. viciae. we have conducted sequence analysis, as well as mutational and transcriptional studies to determine the roles of the flagellin genes in flagellar assembly and function for the sequenced strain  <dig> and our laboratory strain vf39sm. we have studied the flagellin genes in parallel in both strains because the two strains exhibit differences in pattern of flagellation  and also in swarming motility .

recombinant dna techniques
recombinant dna techniques were performed using standard methods  <cit> . restriction endonucleases used in this study were purchased from invitrogen or new england biolabs and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. dna fragments were isolated from agarose gels using qiaquick gel extraction kit . plasmids were isolated from e. coli strains using genejet™ plasmid miniprep kit . total dna was isolated from r. leguminosarum strains using aquapure genomic dna isolation kit . primers were synthesized by sigma genosys  and amplification was carried out using a multi geneii pcr machine . southern blots were performed using a non-radioactive technique with reagents and protocols supplied by roche applied science.

mutagenesis of flagellin genes
the seven fla genes were pcr amplified from r. leguminosarum using the primers listed in additional file  <dig>  the pcr products were individually cloned into the vector pcr <dig> -topo using the topo cloning kit . the genes were excised from the topo vector and then ligated into either pjq200sk or pjq200mp <dig>  <cit> . the details on constructing the individual fla mutants are presented in additional file  <dig>  individual mutations in flaa, flac, flad, and flae were introduced by inserting a gusa-nmr  cassette from pcrs <dig>  <cit>  into the reading frame of each gene. the flab and flag genes were mutated by inserting a spectinomycin and tetracycline resistance cassette, respectively, from php45:Ω  <cit>  and php45:Ω-tc  <cit> . the flah gene was mutated by inserting a kanamycin-resistance cassette from pbsl <dig>  <cit> . the flaa/b/c/d genes were mutated by separately amplifying the 5' end of flaa plus flanking region  and the 3' end of flad plus flanking region . the truncated genes were cloned separately into pcr <dig> -topo and the resulting plasmids  were sequenced at the university of calgary core dna services. the fragment containing the truncated flad gene was subcloned into pbsiisk+  creating pbs::flad3'. a kanamycin-resistance cassette  from pbsl <dig>  <cit>  was ligated upstream of the flad3' fragment resulting in the construct pbs::flad3'-km. the fragment containing the truncated flaa gene  was subcloned into pbs::flad3'-km, upstream of the km-cassette creating pbs::flad3'-km-flaa5'. a fragment containing the truncated flaa gene, kanamycin resistance cassette, and truncated flad gene was subcloned from pbs::flad3'-km-flaa5' into pjq200mp <dig>  <cit>  creating pjqmp18::flad3'-km-flaa5'. each of the mutated gene/s was introduced into the genome of r. leguminosarum by homologous recombination. the flaa/b/c/d mutants have deletions in the following: flaa 3' end; flab; flac; and flad 5' end. southern hybridization and/or pcr were performed for each gene to confirm replacement of the wild-type gene with the mutated gene/s.

construction of gene fusions and ß-glucuronidase  reporter gene assays
the promoter region of flab was cloned upstream of a promoterless gusa gene in pfus <dig>  <cit> . the resulting construct was introduced into vf39sm and  <dig> by biparental mating. vf39sm and  <dig> strains containing the flab-gusa fusion were grown in ty broth for  <dig> hours at 30°c  <cit> . β-glucuronidase activity was measured as described by jefferson et al.  <cit>  and modified by yost et al.  <cit> . the data given are the means of triplicate experiments.

swimming motility test
the strains were grown in ty broth for  <dig> hours. swimming motility was determined by inoculating the strains into a motility medium  containing the following:  <dig> % agar,  <dig> % yeast extract, and  <dig> mm mgso <dig>  <cit> . the optical densities  of the cultures were standardized and equal amounts of inoculum were inoculated into the swimming agar using a fine-point pipette tip. the swimming diameter was measured 3- <dig> days after inoculation.

swarming motility test
the swarm assay was performed following the method described by tambalo et al.  <cit> . briefly, r. leguminosarum wildtype and fla mutant strains were grown in ty broth for  <dig> hours. equal amounts of inoculum from the ty culture was used to inoculate swarm plates. the plates were incubated at 22°c for two to three weeks and the swarming motility of the fla mutants was compared with the wildtype.

flagellar filament isolation
flagellin proteins were isolated from r. leguminosarum based on the procedure described by maruyama et al.  <cit> . cells were grown in  <dig> ml of ty broth for  <dig> hours with slow agitation . the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes. the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> mm phosphate buffer. the bacterial cells were vigorously agitated using a vortex to detach the flagella from the cells. the mixture was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes using a sorval centrifuge. the supernatant was removed and centrifuged again at the same speed and time. the supernatant containing the detached flagella was centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> hours. the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm phosphate buffer.

immunoblot
the flagellar protein samples were denatured at 100°c for  <dig> minutes and then separated on 12% acrylamide sds-page gel at 200v for  <dig> minutes. molecular size markers from bio-rad and fermentas were used. after electrophoresis, the gel was blotted onto a pvdf membrane  using the bio-rad apparatus and protocol for electrophoretic transfer. the blot was blocked with 10% skim milk solution for  <dig> hours. after washing with phosphate-buffered saline  solution, the blot was probed overnight using a polyclonal flagellar antibody raised in a rabbit against isolated flagellar filaments  <cit> . protein a-alkaline phosphatase  was used as the secondary antibody. the blot was washed with pbs and was developed using nbt/bcip .

preparation of samples for tandem mass spectrometry analysis 
the flagellar protein samples were run on a polyacrylamide gel as described above. staining and destaining of the protein gel were performed following standard protocols  <cit> . the gel was soaked overnight in a staining solution containing  <dig> % coomassie brilliant blue , 40% methanol, and 10% acetic acid. destaining was done using a solution containing 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. the bands  were excised and submitted to the southern alberta mass spectrometry  centre at the university of calgary for lc-ms/ms analysis. two bands within the size range were observed in the gel. the two bands were analyzed separately for  <dig> and in combination for vf39sm.

the gel slices were rinsed once with hplc-grade water and then twice with  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50%  acetonitrile. the gel slices were dehydrated with acetonitrile prior to lyophilization. the dehydrated gel was resuspended in  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate  and samples were digested with trypsin. the peptides were extracted from the gel using 1% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile. the extracts were reduced to dryness and then reconstituted in mobile phase of the buffer  for liquid chromatography.

tandem mass spectrometry analysis 
the digests were analyzed using an integrated agilent  <dig> lc-ion-trap-xct-ultra system , which has an integrated fluidic cartridge for peptide capture, separation, and nano-spraying . the injected samples were trapped and desalted for  <dig> minutes using a pre-column channel  with an auxiliary pump that delivers 3% acetonitrile and  <dig> % formic acid at a flowrate of  <dig> μl/minute. the peptides were reverse-eluted from the trapping column and separated on a  <dig> mm-long analytical column  at a flowrate of  <dig>  μl/minute. the peptides were eluted using a 5-70%  acetonitrile gradient in  <dig> %  formic acid over a period of  <dig> minutes. the ms/ms spectra were collected by data-dependent acquisition, with parent ion scans of  <dig> th/s over m/z 400- <dig> . ms/ms scans at the same rate over m/z 100- <dig> 

mass spectrometry data analysis
dataanalysis software for the  <dig> series ion trap, v <dig>   was used to extract the peak-list data. the ms/ms data were analyzed using mascot v <dig>   with the following parameters:  <dig>  da precursor ion mass tolerance,  <dig>  da fragment ion mass tolerance, and one potential missed cleavage. a protein database for r. leguminosarum  <dig> was obtained from the wellcome trust sanger institute website ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/rl/ and was deposited in mascot. the deposited r. leguminosarum  <dig> protein database was used for database searching to identify the proteins present in the flagellar preparations. a cut-off score  of  <dig> was used for all peptides and since the flagellins of r. leguminosarum are highly homologous, we required at least one unique peptide for a flagellin protein to be considered a match. we also determined the relative abundance of the flagellin proteins based on the exponentially modified protein abundance index  values, which were automatically generated using mascot analysis. the empai value is based on the correlation of the observed flagellin peptides in the ms/ms analysis and the number of observable peptides  for each flagellin protein  <cit> .

glycoprotein staining
flagellar preparations from vf39sm and  <dig> were run on 12% acrylamide at 200v for  <dig> hour and  <dig> minutes. glycosylation of flagellin subunits was determined using a pro-q emerald  <dig> glycoprotein gel stain kit  following the manufacturer's instructions. after glycoprotein staining, the total protein was visualized by staining the gel with  <dig> % coommassie blue.

transmission electron microscopy
transmission electron microscopy was performed by slightly modifying the procedure used by miller et al.  <cit> . the r. leguminosarum wildtype and fla mutant strains were grown on ty plates at 30°c for  <dig> hours. a culture suspension was prepared using sterile double distilled water. a formvar carbon-coated grid was placed on top of a cell suspension drop for  <dig> minutes and excess liquid was removed. staining was performed using 1% uranyl acetate for  <dig> seconds. samples were observed using a philips  <dig> transmission electron microscope or a hitachi- <dig> transmission electron microscope with images taken with an amt image capture engine. the length of the flagellar filaments formed by the wildtype and mutant strains was measured using scion image http://www.scioncorp.com/.

RESULTS
characterization of flagellin genes in r. leguminosarum 
there are seven flagellin  genes  in the genome of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain  <dig>  <cit> . sequence analysis and transcriptional studies indicate that all of the seven flagellin genes are transcribed separately as monocistronic genes. six flagellin genes  are found on the chromosome, with flaa/b/c/d located within the major chemotaxis and motility gene cluster  <cit>  while flae is encoded on plasmid prl <dig>  the sizes of the predicted encoded proteins are: flaa,  <dig> amino acids; flab,  <dig> amino acids; flac,  <dig> amino acids; flad,  <dig> amino acids; flae,  <dig> amino acids; flah,  <dig> amino acids, and flag,  <dig> amino acids, respectively. the sizes of these flagellin subunits are smaller than the flagellin proteins of s. meliloti   <cit>  and r. lupini   <cit> . the predicted molecular masses of the proteins are: flaa- <dig> kda; flab- <dig> kda; flac- <dig> kda; flad- <dig> kda; flae-31; kda; flah- <dig> kda; flag- <dig> kda. our group has also determined the sequences of the flagellin genes of r. leguminosarum strain vf39sm  and found that the predicted flagellin subunits of this strain are 99% to 100% identical to the corresponding flagellins in  <dig>  all of the flagellin proteins of r. leguminosarum exhibit conserved residues at the amino and carboxy-terminal ends . the central regions of the proteins, on the other hand, contain the highest variability. in terms of flagellin sequence similarity, flaa/b/c/e/g are highly similar, exhibiting 86-93% similarity to each other. the other two flagellins, flad and flah, are more distant, and respectively share 62% and 64% similarity with flaa.

ultrastructure of the flagellar filament of r. leguminosarum
electron microscopy work confirmed that r. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain  <dig> is subpolarly flagellated  <cit> , while strain vf39sm is peritrichously flagellated, exhibiting 4- <dig> flagella per cell . the flagellar filaments of strains  <dig> and vf39sm were around  <dig> μm in length and averaged  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm in width, respectively. the surface of the filaments appeared smooth  and lacked the recognizable cross-hatched pattern observed in the complex flagella of s. meliloti   <cit>  and r. lupini  <cit> . it is possible that the surface of the r. leguminosarum filaments lacks helical perturbations or the perturbations are not as prominent as those of the complex filaments of the other soil bacteria.

transcription of r. leguminosarum fla genes
previous transcriptional studies in our lab using gusa fusions demonstrated that for both vf39sm and  <dig>  flaa, flac, and flad have the highest expression  to  <dig> mu) while minimal expression  was observed for flae, flah, and flag  <cit> . the gene fusion for flab reported in that paper was made in a different vector, pfaj <dig>  so comparisons of flab expression to that of the other flagellins were not valid. to place levels of flab transcription in a proper context compared to the other fla genes, a new fusion to the flab promoter was made in pfus <dig>  and gene expression of flab was measured at  <dig> ±  <dig> mu in  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> in vf39sm. these results suggest that flaa, flab, flac, and flad are the major flagellin subunits of r. leguminosarum while flae, flah, and flag play minor roles. however, the presence of post-transcriptional regulation in flagellin biosynthesis cannot be precluded; hence, we performed mutational analysis. we have constructed strains with individual mutations in the seven flagellin genes and two multiple fla mutants  for both strains vf39sm and  <dig>  the resulting mutants were examined for motility defects, using swimming and swarming assays, and morphological defects, using transmission electron microscopy.

motility assays and electron microscopy of wildtype and fla mutant strains
the swimming and swarming properties of the wildtype and fla mutant strains are summarized in table  <dig>  to account for the motility phenotypes of the mutant strains, we determined the effect of mutating the flagellin genes on the structure of the flagellar filament. in general, the flagellar filaments of all the individual flagellin mutants appeared to have normal fine structure and the width of the filament  was nearly identical to that of the wildtype.
wildtype and flagellin mutants

*percentage relative to wildtype swimming diameter. means of at least two replicates.  means non-motile; † as observed by tem; nd means not determined; values in parenthesis refer to the average length of a flagellar filament ± standard deviation. the lengths of the flagella formed by the fla mutants are significantly different from the flagella formed by the wildtype strain .

the swimming motility of the  <dig> flaa mutant was significantly reduced while the vf39sm flaa mutant was non-motile on swimming plates. complementation of  <dig> flaa and vf39sm flaa mutants with pbbrmcs1-mcs5::flaa completely restored swimming motility, confirming that swimming defects were due to loss of flaa. both of the flaa mutants were also unable to swarm. the vf39sm flaa mutant strain was non-flagellated . most of the  <dig> flaa mutants observed by tem were non-flagellated. only one cell was observed to possess a very thin and short appendage . individual mutations in flab for both  <dig> and vf39sm, and flac for vf39sm resulted in a reduced number of flagella and shorter filaments , which could account for the considerable reduction in swimming and swarming motility . the lengths of the flagellar filaments formed by the vf39sm flab and vf39sm flac mutants were reduced to around half of the wildtype flagellum. mutation of flab in  <dig> also resulted in the synthesis of shorter filaments, exhibiting an average length of  <dig>  μm. in terms of the number of filaments formed, almost all of the vf39sm flab- and vf39sm flac- cells observed exhibited only one flagellum per cell compared with the 4- <dig> flagella formed by the wildtype strain. multiple mutations in flaa/b/c/d for both  <dig> and vf39sm  resulted in non-flagellated and consequently non-motile strains. complementation of the  <dig> flaa/b/c/d - strain with cosmid  <dig>  <cit> , which was shown by hybridization to carry flaa, flab, flac, and flad, restored swimming and swarming motility to near wildtype levels . the vf39sm flae , flah, and flag mutants  exhibited normal flagellation while vf39sm flad  displayed normal number and length of flagella, although the flagellar filaments were thinner along their entire length . also, individual mutations of flad, flae, flah, and flag did not significantly affect swimming and swarming motility in vf39sm . a different phenotype was observed in  <dig> flae and flah mutants, which exhibited truncated filaments  and reduced swimming motility. the flagellar filaments formed by the  <dig> flae- and  <dig> flah- strains averaged  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm in length, respectively. although the swimming motility of  <dig> flae and  <dig> flah mutant strains were reduced, the swarming motility was not significantly affected.

the motility assays and the filament morphologies demonstrate that flaa is an essential flagellin subunit for r. leguminosarum. mutation of flaa resulted in non-flagellated  and consequently non-motile strains. it is possible that , flaa forms the proximal part of the filament, hence when flaa is not synthesized, r. leguminosarum fails to assemble the distal part of the filaments using the other subunits synthesized. the major role of flaa in filament assembly and function is similar to what has been reported in s. meliloti, a. tumefaciens, and r. lupini  <cit> 
. in all three species, mutation of flaa resulted in non-motile strains. however, unlike the non-flagellated vf39sm flaa mutant, strains of s. meliloti, a. tumefaciens and r. lupini with mutations in flaa were able to polymerize severely truncated filaments. whereas flaa is an essential subunit, it is not sufficient to assemble a fully functional flagellar filament as demonstrated in the flab/c/d mutants. the flab/c/d mutant strains exhibited shorter filaments and have reduced numbers of flagella , which might have been assembled using flaa and the other minor flagellin subunits . in addition, the assembled filaments were not fully functional as demonstrated by the motility assays.

it is also apparent from our functional studies that both flab and flac are major components of the flagellar filament since mutation in each of the genes resulted in shorter filaments, reduced number of flagella, and consequently reduced motility. it is possible that flab and flac are located in the middle part of the filament, hence only the proximal part of the filament, composed of flaa and possibly other minor subunits, is formed in the flab and flac mutants. additionally, the reduction in the length and number of filaments in the flab and flac mutants may reflect an increase in the brittleness and fragility of the filament. our claim that flaa, flab, and flac are the major flagellins of vf39sm and  <dig> is further supported by our gene expression studies which demonstrated high promoter activities for flaa, flab, and flac. it is also possible that flad contributes to the flagellar filament since the amount of flad transcript was also high and the filaments formed by the vf39sm flad mutant were thinner than the wildtype. the formation of thinner filaments also suggests that flad might be located along the entire length of the filament for vf39sm, thus the need for a high amount of flad transcripts. however, it is remarkable that the swimming and swarming motility of the vf39sm flad mutant are not impaired. a possible explanation could be that the width of the filament formed by the flad mutant is still enough to support the normal function of the flagella. contrary to the major roles of flaa/b/c/d in vf39sm, flae, flah, and flag appear to be minor components of the flagellar filament as indicated by expression levels as measured in gene fusions, and by the subtle effects of their mutations on flagellar filament morphology and on motility. in  <dig>  flae and flah appeared to be important for swimming but not for swarming motility. since the tem images for the wildtype and fla mutant strains were obtained from vegetative cells, it would be interesting to observe the filaments formed by the swarm cells of  <dig> flae and  <dig> flah mutants.

tandem mass spectrometry analysis
flagellar samples were prepared from the wildtype strains and were run on sds-page. immunoblots were prepared using a polyclonal flagellar antibody. however, due to the similar size of all seven flagellins , we failed to resolve all subunits . thus, we decided to perform tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the flagellin subunits that are incorporated by the wildtype strains into flagellar filaments. we frequently observed two adjacent bands in the protein gel for both  <dig> and vf39sm . to determine the subunits present in each of the two bands, the bands were analyzed separately for  <dig>  for vf39sm, the two bands were pooled together. using the mass spectrometry data, we were also able to estimate the relative abundance of the flagellin subunits using the empai values  <cit> 
. it has been shown in a previous study that the empai value is directly proportional to protein content  <cit>  and this parameter has been utilized in determining the relative abundance of a number of proteins  <cit> . the empai value provides an easy estimate of protein abundance since it is automatically generated using the mascot program.

the locations of the flagellin peptides detected in the flagellar preparations are indicated in fig.  <dig> and  <dig>  only flaa, flab, and flac peptides were detected in the flagellar preparation for strain  <dig>  with sequence coverage ranging from 31% to 46%. these three subunits also comprised the majority of the flagellin subunits detected in vf39sm . flae and flag comprised a small fraction of the flagellin subunits detected in the vf39sm wt strain. the sequence coverage for the flagellin subunits detected in vf39sm ranged from 18% to 46%. the results obtained from the ms/ms analysis indicate that at least three flagellin subunits  are incorporated into the functional flagellar filament of strain  <dig> while vf39sm polymerizes five flagellins  into its flagellar filament. the consistently shorter flagellar filaments formed by the flagellin mutants  and the absence of flagellar filaments in vf39sm flaa mutants and nearly all cells of  <dig> flaa- also suggest that the major subunits , at least, are present in the complete flagella that are assembled.

peptides for flad, flae, flah, and flag were not detected in the flagellar preparation for  <dig> while flad peptides were not detected in vf39sm. the absence of the flagellin subunits could be due to the following reasons:  they are not synthesized under the conditions tested;  the subunits are synthesized but at a very low concentration, hence they remained undetected; and/or  the flagellin subunits are highly unstable. for strain  <dig>  mutation of flae and flah resulted in a reduction in swimming motility, suggesting that these subunits probably contribute to the flagellar filament. however, flae and flah peptides were not detected in the wildtype flagellar preparations, indicating that these peptides may not be stable under the conditions used.

glycosylation of flagellin subunits
we observed that for strain  <dig>  both the upper and the lower bands on the protein gel contained the same set of flagellin subunits  . the molecular masses  of the bands observed on the gel also appeared to be higher than the predicted molecular masses  for flaa and flab. this suggests that at least flaa and flab may have undergone post-translational modification, resulting in a higher molecular weight and subsequently slower migration in the protein gel.

analysis of the flagellin amino acid sequences of r. leguminosarum  revealed the presence of two to four putative glycosylation signals   <cit> . the ms/ms spectral data for the identified peptides containing the glyosylation signal were also analyzed for the presence of glycosylation, based on the presence of peaks  corresponding to different types of glycosylation . however, we have not identified any potential glycosylation for these peptides which may be attributed to the lability of this modification  <cit> . also, sequence coverage only ranged from 18% to 46%  and peptides at the c-termini of the flagellin subunits were not detected. the c-terminus contains a common glycosylation site for the r. leguminosarum flagellin subunits but these glycosylations were not detected in the ms/ms analysis, which could be due to the above reason. thus, we performed glycoprotein staining to determine if the flagellins are post-translationally modified by glycosylation. we observed positive staining for the flagellins of both vf39sm and  <dig> suggesting that these flagellins are glycosylated . we were unable to determine which flagellins are glycosylated because the seven flagellins were not separated on the protein gel. glycosylation of flagellins has been reported in a number of animal and plant pathogens including campylobacter jejuni  <cit> , helicobacter pylori  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , pseudomonas syringae  <cit> , listeria monocytogenes  <cit> , a. tumefaciens  <cit> , acidovorax avenae  <cit> , as well as in the nitrogen-fixing bacterium azosprillum brasilense  <cit> . it has been suggested that glycosylation may play a role in flagellar filament assembly and in pathogenesis  <cit> . in soil bacteria, it may also function in the attachment of bacteria to the plant roots  <cit> , and in avoiding recognition by the host plant  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we were able to clarify the roles of the seven flagellin subunits in the assembly of the flagellar filament in r. leguminosarum. taken altogether, our results indicate that flaa is an essential subunit, but that it is not enough to assemble a fully functional flagellar filament. flab and flac are major components of the filament while flad, flae, flah, and flag are only minor components. to assemble a fully functional filament, at least three  and five  flagellin subunits should be synthesized by  <dig> and vf39sm, respectively. there were no substantial differences in the requirements for individual flagellins in swimming vs. swarming motility. the flagellins of  <dig> and vf39sm are possibly modified by glycosylation.
