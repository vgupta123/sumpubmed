BACKGROUND
the technological advances that have produced "the third phase of human genomics": sequencing of individual genomes and the determination of rare variants across populations by enabling whole genome sequencing at low cost  <cit> , are accompanied by higher error rates  <cit> . improved statistical methods that accommodate these high error rates are needed in the calling of heterozygous sites from low coverage data  <cit> . the design of effective statistical methods requires precise characterization of error in high-throughput sequence data. previous work has examined the behavior of individual base-call errors in sequence reads  <cit> . in this paper we discuss a previously undescribed phenomenon in sequence data where these base-call errors aggregate at specific genomic locations across multiple sequence reads. we focus on illumina technology, although we have observed systematic error on other platforms and return to this in the discussion.

we begin by describing the types of sequencing error that have been previously characterized, and their relationship to the systematic error we have discovered. the likelihood of a base-call error occurring at any particular location in a sequence read is influenced by several parameters. it is known that base-call errors are more likely towards the ends of reads and that surrounding sequence motifs influence error frequencies  <cit> . for example, errors are more likely at positions preceded by gg or following a number of ggc motifs  <cit> , but regardless of the preceding motif, errors become more likely towards the end of reads  <cit> . however, we have found that errors at some genomic positions appear with greater frequency than can be explained by these effects, and we refer to this as systematic error. systematic error manifests as many individual base-call errors from separate sequence reads occurring at the same genomic position . thus, a systematic error comprises many individual base-call errors  that fall at the same genomic location.

these errors have the potential to be especially troublesome because they can confound methods that identify errors based on their sparsity among reads. for example, we show systematic errors affect current snp  calling methods, where the first step involves computing the posterior probability for a snp at every site based on relative nucleotide counts  <cit> . although filters based on the depth of reads are frequently applied   <cit> , most existing approaches will not identify systematic errors, or distinguish them from true snps. similarly, the detection of rna editing sites in rna-seq data is complicated by systematic error, because an accumulation of errors at a transcriptome site can appear to be an edit event when compared with a reference genome that may have been sequenced using another technology  <cit> .

in this paper we present a thorough characterization of systematic errors using illumina short-read sequencing data that is optimized for the detection of errors because of high coverage and high numbers of paired-end reads in which the paired reads overlapped. we show that systematic errors must be accounted for when annotating heterozygous alleles, and that although improved base calling software can correct a small number of systematic errors, it is not sufficient by itself. we present an efficient statistical algorithm for the detection of systematic error and use it to show that systematic errors are present in other datasets, including an rna-seq dataset, a viral reference genome and new illumina hiseq  <dig> data from the  <dig> genomes project.

RESULTS
to investigate the types of errors present in whole-genome illumina high throughput sequencing data, we conducted a paired-end methyl-seq experiment on a male human individual with read length of  <dig> bp . a methyl-seq experiment is ideal for investigating systematic error because the experiment results in high average coverage due to the fact that only sites cut by the restriction enzyme are assayed. the reads were mapped with bowtie  <cit>  allowing up to two mismatches. our experiment spanned  <dig> , <dig> genomic locations at an average coverage of  <dig> . due to the small fragment size in methyl-seq experiments many of the mate-pair reads overlapped, providing for each such location two base calls sequenced from the same dna molecule  albeit from different directions. we made use of this to distinguish between base-call errors and true heterozygosity calls in the following manner: each pair of bases originating from a single mate-pair and sequencing the same position was denoted a reference-pair if both calls agreed with the reference genome, a snp-pair if both calls disagreed with the reference genome and agreed among themselves, and an error-pair if one of the calls agreed with the reference genome but the other did not. a snp-pair could consist of two base-call errors, in the case that both of the paired reads had an error at the same location, but the probability of such an event was low and we ignored such cases in this study.

because we focused on overlapping mate-pairs, we report all results in terms of pairs. for example, when stating coverage we state the number of pairs overlapping a site , and when we state a location has 40% errors it means that of the pairs overlapping the location 40% were error-pairs. in our experiment  <dig> , <dig> genomic locations were covered by both reads of some mate-pair but we restricted our analysis to the  <dig> , <dig> of these locations with a coverage depth of at least  <dig>  these  <dig> , <dig> genomic locations where covered by a total of  <dig> , <dig> base-call pairs,  <dig>  of which were error-pairs.

extent of systematic error
we found many locations at which there seemed to be an accumulation of errors. to test the extent of this phenomenon we computed the expected number of locations with each possible proportion of error. let c <dig>  ..., cj, ..., c <dig> be the number of locations with coverage j in our data , and p:=#error-pairs#pairs= <dig>  be the probability of sequencing error. let bi be a random variable for the number of locations from c <dig>  ..., cj, ..., c <dig> with proportion of errors i, and let bij be a random variable for the number of locations with coverage j and proportion of error i. we computed the expected number of locations to have each proportion of errors i as

 e= ∑je= ∑jcjjkijpkij, 

where kij is the number of errors for coverage j that results in proportion of error i. figure  <dig> shows a log-scale histogram of the expected and observed counts for these different error-proportions. the observed counts in the higher frequencies of errors are larger than the expected counts, indicating that there are more locations than expected that have a high frequency of base-call errors. we called such locations systematic errors, and set out to determine the characteristics of these locations, with the goal of lowering the false-positive rates in calling heterozygous sites.

for further characterization, we annotated a set of locations in which the number of error-pairs was significantly higher than expected, given the observed frequency of error. setting p =  <dig>  as in the previous section, we compute a p-value for a given location with i errors and n coverage as p=∑k=inpk, where k is a random variable indicating the number of errors at a location. of the  <dig> , <dig> locations with coverage of at least  <dig>   <dig>  locations were annotated as systematic errors, using a bonferroni correction for a  <dig>  significance level. we used a bonferroni correction because it ensures that the probability of even one false-positive is ≤  <dig> , resulting in a set that is low in false-positives, and therefore suitable for characterizing the nature of systematic error. we note that this calculation yielded a lower bound on the frequency of systematic errors in our dataset of approximately  <dig> in  <dig> bp.

characterizing systematic errors
having annotated the set of  <dig>  systematic errors, we looked for characteristic features that could be identified in any high throughput sequencing experiment. of the  <dig>  sites we have determined as systematic errors,  <dig> had all base-call errors on the forward read and  <dig>  had all base-call errors on the reverse read . we conclude from this that in systematic errors the base-call errors tend to appear on just one of the sequencing directions . this tendency was noticed in  <cit> , where the directionality on which errors occurred was used to filter false-positives from the set of heterozygous sites annotated. a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the sequencing of some motifs, which are different on the opposite strands, have higher probability than others for base-call errors, resulting in systematic errors. this is consistent with the known overlap in absorption spectra of the g and t channels identified by a single laser in illumina sequencing.

we therefore tested whether there are significant motifs surrounding systematic errors by generating a sequence logo  <cit>  for the reference sequences around the systematic errors . interestingly, we found that the first base upstream of the systematic error has greater information regarding the presence of a systematic error than the base at which the error is present. we found that the large majority of systematic errors are preceded by a g, and that two g bases followed by a t at the error site is by far the most common and characteristic sequence at systematic error locations. although the ggt motif is a strong characteristic of systematic errors, an analysis restricted to ggt sites  showed that  <dig> sites, out of all  <dig>  ggt sites, have a significant accumulation of errors. this shows that systematic errors are not accounted for by this motif alone.

to gain insight into the types of sequencing errors present at systematic errors we computed the frequencies of the different base substitutions in both systematic errors and throughout the entire dataset . we witnessed an extremely strong tendency for the t >g error compared to all others. our results show that there is a higher substitution rate to gs than to the other nucleotides and that the substitution rate to a or t is considerably lower than the substitution rate to c. with respect to the reference bases at which systematic errors occur, there is a stronger tendency of error at a or t than at c or g. we divided the systematic error locations based on the reference base at which the error occurred, and tested for motifs in each of the four sets . we concluded that the strongest motif at systematic errors is that of ggt where the error is at the t, resulting in an incorrect base call of g.

to test whether the quality scores at the locations of systematic errors account for the extent of base-call errors observed, we computed a p-value for each location given its specific quality scores: given n  quality scores let ki be a random variable for the number of errors at locations  <dig> to i, and let xi be an indicator variable for whether there was an error or not at location i. we then have that

 p=pp+pp, 

and can use dynamic programming to compute the p-value for each location in o time. of the  <dig> , <dig> positions with read count of at least  <dig>   <dig> had a significant accumulation of error under a bonferroni correction for a significance level of  <dig>  . it is interesting that significant positions were found, given that in general throughout the experiment the quality scores tend to predict a higher error rate than that observed .

the characteristics of systematic errors, occurring mostly at ggt motifs where the error that occurs is a t >g substitution, implies that the errors could be a result of the sequencing technology, which makes it hard to distinguish between a ggg and a ggt instance. it is the base-calling algorithm that makes such distinctions, given the images output from the illumina machine. we asked whether systematic errors could be accounted for by base-callers that utilize sophisticated statistical techniques to reduce error. to test this we compared the systematic errors present in a dataset base-called by bustard  to those present in the same dataset when base-called by naivebayescall  <cit> , to our knowledge the most accurate base-calling algorithm available. we used for this the dataset that was used in  <cit>  from the phix <dig> virus . we found  <dig> systematic errors in the bustard called dataset and  <dig> systematic errors in the naivebayescall dataset, amounting to a systematic error rate of  <dig> in  <dig> bp and  <dig> in  <dig> bp respectively. we believe the higher frequency of systematic errors is due to the phix <dig> genome being richer than human in ggt motifs  and to the high sequencing coverage . these results show that while systematic error can be reduced with more sophisticated base calling, it is a persistent problem at a significant level even when using state of the art methods.

to test replicability of the locations at which systematic errors occur, we conducted a second methyl-seq experiment on the same individual . the error frequency in this second experiment was determined as p=#error-pairs#pairs= <dig>  and of the  <dig> , <dig> locations with coverage of at least  <dig> pair-calls,  <dig>  locations were annotated as systematic errors using a bonferroni correction of  <dig> . from the  <dig> , <dig> positions with at least  <dig> pair-calls in both of the experiments,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were annotated as systematic errors in the first and second experiments, respectively, and of those  <dig>  locations were annotated as systematic errors in both experiments. this shows that while there is some variability in the locations determined as systematic errors, locations at which systematic errors occur are highly replicable . we tested whether the significant overlap of the locations at which systematic errors were detected was due to ggt motifs being more prone for systematic errors than other motifs. of the  <dig>  ggt sites that were overlapped by at least  <dig> pair-calls in each experiment,  <dig>  and  <dig>  locations were annotated as systematic errors in the first and second experiments, respectively, and of these  <dig>  locations were annotated as systematic errors in both experiments . the lists of systematic errors for both experiments are available at: http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/syscall/systematic_error_lists/.

identification and correction of systematic errors
the main concern regarding systematic errors is that they may be incorrectly annotated as heterozygous sites in an individual or as rare variants in a population. fortunately, in systematic error the extent of error at a location usually does not result in an equal ratio of reference to non-matching reference calls, making it easier for methods that expect such a ratio to identify these sites as non-snps. nonetheless, samtools  <cit>  identified  <dig> of the  <dig>  systematic errors in our methyl-seq dataset as snps , and in the snp-calling procedure for the  <dig> genomes project a filtering step based on directionality of sequencing was used to account for systematic errors . systematic error may pose an even greater difficulty in population studies, where allele ratios are not expected to be 1: <dig>  this difficulty also arises in rna-seq experiments in which variants are annotated alongside expression levels  <cit> . systematic error may also affect rna-seq experiments in the bias it can introduce in coverage at systematic error sites. such bias can in turn affect expression level estimates  <cit> .

to account for this we have designed syscall - a classifier which given a list of potential heterozygous sites and the reads from an illumina experiment classifies each location as a systematic error or a heterozygous site . our classifier uses logistic regression to combine the different characteristics of systematic errors and make predictions . importantly, syscall does not assume that the experiment preformed is paired-end or that the expected frequency of variant observations is half, making it applicable to the different types of high throughput experiments discussed.

assessing syscall's performance
in order to test syscall's performance we annotated a set of locations in our methyl-seq dataset that would be candidates for heterozygous sites  and for which using the overlap between paired reads we could call as systematic errors or heterozygous sites with high certainty. we used the same sets of locations that were annotated for training syscall : a "snps" set consisting of  <dig> locations and a "systematic errors" set consisting of  <dig> locations. from each mate-pair one of the reads was chosen at random to simulate a non-overlapping  dataset.

as a first test of our classification algorithm we ran  <dig> iterations in which we generated training and test sets by randomly dividing the "snps" and "systematic errors" sets into halves . in each iteration we generated a feature matrix for the training and test sets, learned the coefficients of the logistic regression classifier from the training set, and classified the instances of the test set, recording the percentage of instances that were classified correctly . the distribution of the percentage of instances classified correctly from the  <dig> iterations had a mean of  <dig> % and a standard deviation of  <dig> .

a strong characteristic of systematic errors is that the differences from the reference have a strong bias to occur on either the forward or reverse direction. we tested the ability to classify locations using the same logistic regression classifier but using only the directionality bias feature: ul = . when running  <dig> iterations of training and testing as before using this classifier, the distribution of the percentage of instances classified correctly had a mean of  <dig> % and a standard deviation of  <dig> . therefore, a significant amount of precision is gained when making use of all six features in the classification process. this is mostly due to an increase in the recall rate of the classifier, where snps that are annotated as systematic errors when using only the directionality bias criterion are recognized as snps when making use of all features.

a main purpose when designing syscall was to be able to distinguish systematic errors from heterozygous sites in datasets of lower coverage than that available to us . to evaluate syscall's performance on different coverage depths, we simulated experiments of lower coverage by randomly sampling a given percentage from the initial set of reads. for each of 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% , we ran  <dig> iterations where in each iteration we randomly chose the given percentage from our reads, refined our set of locations to those with at least one base-call differing from the reference and proceed as in the previous test: divide the locations into a training and test set , compute features, train, classify, and record the percentage of instances classified correctly. the results for these tests, together with the results for the same tests when using only the directionality bias feature for classification are shown in figure  <dig>  syscall's classifications are highly accurate at all of the coverage rates tested, and the improvement relative to using only the directionality bias is negatively correlated with the mean coverage rate, as expected.

to assess syscall's ability to detect false-positives in snp calls from illumina datasets, we analyzed the gaii sequencing data available for na <dig>  chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . samtools called  <dig>  snps in the dataset and syscall partitioned those locations into a set of  <dig>  snps and  <dig> systematic errors. as a "gold standard" dataset we used the snp calls for individual na <dig> available from the hapmap project  <cit> . from the set of snps called by samtools  <dig>   were present in the "gold standard" dataset. of the  <dig>  snps called by syscall  <dig>   were in the "gold standard" set. of the  <dig> systematic errors  <dig>  were in the "gold standard" set. our results show that syscall helps clean the set of snps called by samtools from false-positives. we note that in this analysis half of the reads, in expectation, are expected to differ from the reference. when searching for variants in experiments where this is not the case  it is easier to mistake systematic errors for true variants and in such cases we expect syscall's contribution will be even greater.

presence of systematic errors in other datasets
in order to verify that systematic errors are not specific for the methyl-seq procedure we looked for evidence of systematic errors in other high throughput datasets. we believe systematic error will be extremely important to correct for in rna-seq experiments, in which one attempts to annotate both heterozygous sites and expression levels to derive allele specific expression estimates. we therefore looked for systematic errors in the rna-seq dataset from ambion human brain reference by illumina , on chromosome  <dig>  since this dataset did not contain overlapping paired reads we could not annotate error-pairs. instead, we used directionality bias of the base-calls different from the reference to annotate systematic error. we could do so because the coverage in this dataset is high . for each of the  <dig>  locations covered by at least  <dig> forward and  <dig> reverse reads we conducted a chi-square test, testing for association between occurrence of mismatches and directionality of sequencing. under a bonferroni correction for a  <dig>  significance level, we found  <dig> systematic errors. thus we have approximately  <dig> in  <dig> sites that are shown to be systematic errors. the method used here, using directionality bias, is statistically weaker than the method with which we identified systematic errors from the methyl-seq experiment, where we used overlapping mate-pairs to identify base-call errors. the fact that the frequency of identified systematic errors in the rna-seq dataset is as high as in the methyl-seq dataset implies that there are more systematic errors present in the rna-seq data than in the methyl-seq data; this could be due to this dataset being produced by an older version of illumina's ga.

we also looked at newer illumina data generated by the hiseq  <dig> machines as part of the  <dig> genomes project  <cit> . we analyzed exome data from chromosome  <dig> . we aligned reads to the reference genome with bowtie and refined our analysis to the  <dig>  sites that were covered by at least  <dig> reads in each direction. when conducting the same statistical test as for the rna-seq data, only  <dig> sites were determined as statistically significant with respect to the differences from the reference being present on one of the sequencing directions. however, testing for directionality bias of mismatches in this way has little power, and many strong systematic errors are missed by this method . this results in many locations that are not detected by this method as systematic errors but would be wrongly annotated as heterozygous sites due to their characteristics. we therefore annotated a set of candidate heterozygous sites as those locations with at least 10% of the base-calls being different from the reference sequence and with at least  <dig> differences from the reference, resulting in a set of  <dig>  locations. running syscall on this set,  <dig> locations were classified as systematic errors. when annotating snps in the  <dig> genomes project a filtering step was applied, detailed in sections  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> of the supplementary information of  <cit> , designed specifically to filter out locations in which the base-calls different from the reference are not evenly distributed between the forward oriented and reverse oriented reads. the filtering step applied in  <cit>  to avoid calling systematic errors as snps can decrease the number of false-positive snp calls, but relies on having a sufficient number of reads from each strand and makes use only of the strand-specific characteristic of systematic errors. as we have shown, distinguishing between systematic errors and heterozygous sites can be greatly improved by taking additional evidence into account.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified systematic error in illumina sequence that is prevalent in different types of datasets, and that does not appear to be easily correctible during base-calling. this systematic error has significant implications for snp calling, especially at low coverage  <cit> . moreover, while increasing the extent of coverage enables the detection of rare variants in population studies and low expression rates in transcriptome studies, it also reveals locations of weaker systematic errors . thus, the problem of distinguishing systematic error from true heterozygous sites persists regardless of the extent of coverage. we detected this type of error, and could thoroughly characterize it, thanks to a dataset with overlapping paired-end reads and with very high coverage. making use of our characterization we have designed and implemented a classifier to correct for systematic errors at much lower coverage depths and with no need for paired-end reads. we have shown that by using the different characteristics in the prediction process we gain a significant increase in performance over using directionality bias alone.

although we have provided a preliminary characterization of systematic error, with further work and additional data it may be possible to better identify sequences associated with error. in particular, it should be possible to identify and characterize systematic error resulting from other sequencing technologies. although such a comprehensive assessment is beyond the scope of this study, we have looked at rna-seq solid data from  <cit>  and have identified statistically significant systematic error. at the same time, we believe that as sequencing technology improves systematic errors should decrease, and we have observed this to be the case based on the illumina samples we have investigated. sequence from two years ago shows higher systematic error rates than recently sequenced data. nevertheless, we believe that systematic error is a continuing characteristic of illumina sequence.
