BACKGROUND
the origin of eukaryotic cells was one of the major evolutionary transitions, although very interesting and challenging, still remains poorly understood. the development of the endomembrane system and cellular trafficking machinery are crucial stage in eukaryotic cell evolution  <cit> . an important role in this evolution was played by small gtpases belonging to the ras superfamily  <cit>  that showed a spectacular expansion in eukaryotes  <cit> .

the superfamily is divided into five major families: arf, rab, ran, ras and rho  <cit> . rab proteins form the largest branch of the ras superfamily . this family is much diversified and can be further divided into at least  <dig> groups/subfamilies  <cit> . rab proteins are best known as key regulators of intracellular vesicular transport and membrane trafficking in exocytic and endocytic pathways. each rab protein has a distinct subcellular location and is responsible for a specific transport step. rab proteins from diverse eukaryotes cluster in a phylogenetic tree into at least eight groups showing similar function, and/or subcellular localisation, and sequences  <cit> . this co-segregation of rab gtpases according to common functions rather than to taxonomic relationships indicates a conserved mechanism of rab interaction with regulators/effectors across evolution and a rapid divergence of these functional groups in the early evolution of eukaryotes. during radiation of eukaryotes numerous duplications led to diversification of rab proteins in particular lineages.

evolution and diversification of rab proteins were studied in a global aspect  <cit>  and in particular species  <cit>  and also in selected taxonomic groups  <cit> . however, evolution of particular rab groups was not yet analysed in detail in wide-ranging taxonomic studies. we focused in this study on the vii functional group  containing rab <dig> and rab <dig>  two related subfamilies, showing common localisation to late endosomal compartment.

rab <dig> proteins are localised in late endosomes, lysosomes and phagosomes. they regulate vesicular traffic from early to late endosomes and from late endosome to vacuole/lysosome  <cit> . moreover, rab <dig> proteins participate in the maturation and biogenesis of lysosomes  <cit> . they are also involved in fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes with primary phagosomes in specialized phagocytes  <cit> . they regulate the maturation and biogenesis of phagosomes both in unicellular eukaryotes and macrophages  <cit> .

recently, a novel human isoform of rab <dig>  named rab7b was described . lysosome-localised rab7b is involved in monocytic differentiation of human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and possibly, also in regulation of monocyte functions  <cit> . moreover, it negatively regulates proinflammatory and antipathogenic toll-like receptor  <dig> signalling in macrophages  <cit> . two isoforms of rab <dig> were found in paramecium  <cit>  and in five fungi species  <cit> , three isoforms in trichomonas vaginalis  <cit> , four in lotus japonicus  <cit> , eight in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , and nine in entamoeba histolytica  <cit> .

rab <dig> proteins are found only in late endosomes. they are important for lysosomal enzyme delivery and are a key mediator of vesicular transport from late endosomes to the trans-golgi network   <cit> . moreover, they are responsible for the maintenance of specific late endocytic compartments and endosome/lysosome localisation  <cit> . it has also been found that rab <dig> gtpases are a key component for the replication of several viruses, including hiv <dig>  ebola, marburg, and measles making rab <dig> a potential target for inhibiting replication of some viruses  <cit> . a second human isoform of rab <dig>  named rab9b was reported  <cit>  and additionally a human rab <dig> pseudogene was identified  <cit> .

interestingly, rab <dig> proteins were not yet reported so far in unicellular eukaryotes, plants and fungi. on the other hand, rab <dig> subfamily belongs to the ancestral set of rab present in the ancestor of eukaryotes and all extant descendents  <cit> . previous global phylogenies of rab subfamilies showed close relationships of rab <dig> proteins and rab <dig> proteins  <cit> . however, evolution of these subfamilies was not studied in detail and any stage of evolution of eukaryota in which the rab <dig> subfamily diverged from rab <dig> subfamily was not specified. the functional diversity and the presence of many isoforms of rab <dig> and rab <dig> make it interesting to study evolution, duplication events and phylogenetic relationships of these closely related proteins.

RESULTS
taxonomic distribution of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins
thorough and detailed searches of public databases based on sequence annotation and similarity enabled us to gather as many as  <dig> non-redundant sequences representing rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins. the search showed that rab <dig> proteins are represented in all supergroups of eukaryota: excavata, plantae, chromalveolata, amoebozoa and opisthokonta . however, rab <dig> proteins are present only in representatives of multicellular animals  and monosiga brevicolis, a member of choanoflagellates, the closest known relatives to metazoans  <cit> . assuming the taxonomic distributions we can assume that rab <dig> proteins arose before the radiation of eukaryotes and rab <dig> proteins must have branched later among metazoans and their relatives. interestingly, rab7b isoforms are found only in representatives of amphibians, birds and mammals.

global phylogeny of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins
to have a global view on phylogenetic relationships between all rab7/rab <dig> proteins we at first constructed a global ml tree based on their amino acid sequences. the tree is shown in figure  <dig> . these sequences cluster together with a strong bootstrap support and clearly separate from representatives of the closest rab subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in the tree we can distinguish clades that we expect should be monophyletic. such monophyletic clades create many sequences of entamoeba histolytica and sequences of rab7b isoforms, rab <dig> proteins, some subgroups of excavates , subgroups of plants , most chromalveolates, nematoda, most other metazoans, saccharomycetaceae and most other fungi. a lot of these clades have a moderate or high bootstrap support or, for members of the same taxonomic group, are in a close neighbourhood in the tree. interestingly, we named as rab7c another well-supported clade grouping two highly diverged vertebrate sequences . in some slightly suboptimal trees we observed recovery of expected monophyly of some other clades that are not monophyletic in figure  <dig>  for instance, two separated sequences of chromalveolates  were placed among other chromalveolates, three separated sequences of metazoans  were found in metazoa clade and rab7b from gallus gallus grouped correctly with other amniotes.

however, the tree is generally poorly resolved, especially deep branches are very short and none of them has significant, if any, bootstrap support. many single sequences, especially those of excavata and amoebozoa, are separated from other members of their own supergroup.

these relationships between rab sequences that are inconsistent with species phylogeny are probably artificial and result from a heterogeneous rate of evolution of analysed sequences, insufficient phylogenetic information contained in these short sequences and the long-branch attraction artefact, lba  <cit> . the lba is especially evident in partition of the tree into two parts: one containing much diverged sequences and the other comprising less diverged sequences. however, these relationships are not supported by bootstrap analyses and should be considered uncertain. inconsistencies of obtained phylogeny with species phylogeny are difficult to explain by a horizontal gene transfer or ancient gene duplications before radiation of eukaryotic supergroups and subsequent gene losses in the different lineages. there is no bootstrap support for relationships that would suggest these events. moreover, the latter scenario requires many unparsimonious duplication and loss events, making this explanation highly unlikely. we performed phylogenetic analyses on seven alignment sets excluding gradually the most variable sites, but improvement or clarification could not be obtained because of the small number of sites necessary for a strong phylogenetic signal .

to check consistency of the obtained rab7/rab <dig> gene phylogeny with the species phylogeny, we compared the topology of the found tree with the alternative topology assuming the most probable relationships between main groups of eukaryotes . these analyses revealed that when fast evolving sites are excluded from the data and more relatively conserved sites are present, the hypothesis of relationships between rab proteins agreeable with species phylogeny can not be rejected or even is favoured.

since rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins show heterogeneous evolution rate and are susceptible to lba we applied two programs proposed to such cases: phylobayes  <cit> , bayesian approach and phyml-cat  <cit> , maximum likelihood approach. they use a mixture model describing across-site heterogeneities in the amino acid replacement patterns. it was shown that accounting for such site specific features should both improve a statistical fit  <cit>  and alleviate phylogenetic artefacts due to long-branch attraction phenomena  <cit> .

however, the application of these programs did not improve the obtained phylogenies . although the monophyly of metazoan rab7a proteins was recovered , rab7b from gallus gallus adopted correct grouping with other amniotes and sequences of chlorophytes were clustered with other plants, the obtained trees are still poorly resolved with many unsupported branches. moreover, other inconsistencies appeared, e.g.: choanoflagellate rab7a is separated from metazoan sequences by trypanosomatid clade , more chromalveolate sequences are separated from each other , sequence from monosiga did not take basal position in rab <dig> clade , and among plant clade unrelated sequences are located . our analyses suggest that the phylogenetic signal in data is so weak and the sequences evolve with such a heterogeneous rate that even more sophisticated methods do not cope with inferring global phylogeny of analysed rab proteins.

the obtained results show the presence of many rab <dig> and rab <dig> isoforms and duplicates in metazoans, plants and some unicellular eukaryotes. therefore in subsequent sections we focused on relationships between rab proteins belonging to these taxonomic groups.

phylogeny and duplications of metazoan rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins
the group of metazoa is the most abundant in different rab <dig> and rab <dig> isoforms and duplicates. the phylogeny based on amino acid sequences  revealed distinct and highly supported clades grouping metazoans sequences: rab <dig> proteins , rab7a , rab7b  and rab7c proteins . however, these clades are separated from each other. very divergent sequences of rab <dig>  rab7b and rab7c proteins are also placed among very divergent sequences of excavates and amoebozoans, likely as a result of the lba. considering taxonomic distribution of rab <dig> proteins we should expect that they diverged from rab <dig> proteins before radiation of metazoans at the level of common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoan lineages. similarly, the emergence of rab7b isoforms from rab7a proteins would precede the radiation of four-limbed vertebrates and rab7c proteins would evolve from rab7a at least before radiation of jawed vertebrates.

in order to test the credibility of assumed relationships among metazoan rab proteins we carried out additional phylogenetic analyses of their selected subgroups including potential sister sequences and appropriate out-groups . these analyses were based on nucleotide sequences. they showed stronger phylogenetic signals than amino acid sequences and the trees obtained were better resolved than those constructed on the latter ones. each subgroup was examined separately to avoid the lba resulting from a high substitution rate of the analysed sequences. the trees obtained with ml and bayesian approaches had almost identical topologies.

since saturation of substitutions and base composition may violate reliability of results of phylogenetic analyses  we carried out the appropriate tests to check it . however, the analysed whole nucleotide sets did not show significant saturation effect. we also did not observe a meaningful deviation in nucleotide composition between sequences in these sets.

the exclusive representation of rab <dig> proteins by choanoflagellate monosiga brevicolis and multicellular animals indicated that this subfamily branched from rab <dig> near the divergence of choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages. in agreement with that, a very strongly supported rab <dig> clade, shown on the tree in figure  <dig>  branched among choanoflagellate/metazoan clade of rab7a proteins. such a position is strongly supported by very high bayesian posterior probabilities and moderate lrsh support at two external nodes comprising rab <dig> and rab <dig> sequences of metazoa, monosiga ovata and capsaspora owczarzaki, a unicellular opisthokont closely related to animals and choanoflagellates  <cit> . similarly, rab7b proteins were identified only in the four-limbed vertebrates suggesting their divergence from rab7a isoforms before radiation tetrapods. actually, the clade of rab7b proteins is placed among this group of vertebrates with moderate posterior probability support and very high lrsh support . the expected position of rab7c gtpases represented only by sequences of danio rerio and xenopus tropicalis is also recovered . they branched at the base of vertebrate rab7a clade with very high lrsh and posterior probability and moderate ml bootstrap support. the clade rab7c has very high bootstrap values and contains none of representatives of amniotes and only the teleost fish and amphibian. therefore a loss of this isoform can be assumed in the amniote lineage.

the phylogenetic reconstructions also revealed that subsequent duplications of rab genes occurred in different lineages. both the protein and gene trees include highly supported sister clades comprising rab9a and rab9b isoforms . each of these clades groups rab <dig> sequences of fishes, amphibians, birds and mammals suggesting that the duplication occurred among this subfamily prior to divergence of jawed vertebrates. moreover, two clustered gene copies of both rab <dig> and rab7b are present in xenopus laevis indicating additional duplications that occurred in this species . since three rab7a gene copies were found in danio rerio and two in tetraodon nigroviridis, it may suggest duplications in rab7a isoforms among the teleost fish lineage.

to further resolve observed relationships between particular rab genes we compared regions including these interesting rab genes from key genomes of danio rerio, tetraodon nigroviridis, xenopus tropicalis, gallus gallus and canis familiaris based on data available in ensembl database  <cit> . the analyses showed that the rab genes belonging to the same clade, i.e. rab7a, rab7b, rab7c, rab9a and rab9b, were flanked by their own set of orthologous  genes. it indicates that the genes clustered together in these clades have the common origin which is in agreement with high bootstrap values at their nodes in phylogenetic trees. it is worth to mention that the local conservation of orthologous gene content was also found for two rab7c genes. since they are highly diverged one could assume that they are grouped because of lba and should be placed separately among the vertebrate rab7a clade. however, the analysis of synteny allows assuming the common descent of these two genes.

no shared synteny with any compared genomes we found only for two genes from d. rerio encoding proteins with accession numbers np_ <dig>  and np_ <dig> . these genes are grouped together, take basal position in the tree and are separated from other rab7a proteins. probably they represent early duplicated rab genes which were not retained in other vertebrates.

the observed duplications of rab genes are probably a result of whole genome duplications  that occurred at least three times in the vertebrate lineage. the emergence of the rab7c clade and the duplications among vertebrate rab <dig> proteins mapped before splitting of jawed vertebrates could be related to one or two rounds  of wgd . the third round of wgd  occurred in teleost fishes  <cit> , which is also reflected in fish rab7a duplications. observed rab <dig> and rab7b gene copies in xenopus laevis are probably related to tetraploidization of its genome  <cit> . as a result of all these duplication events danio rerio, xenopus laevis and homo sapiens possess as many as  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rab7/rab <dig> gene copies, respectively.

it is interesting that not all analysed taxa contain a full set of all rab isoforms. for example, rab7c clade is represented only by one fish  and one amphibian  sequence. probably, different rab gene copies were lost in different genera/species or these genes have not yet been identified. such asymmetry in duplicated gene distribution is in agreement with results of woods et al.  <cit>  who found that many different duplicated genes were retained in danio and tetraodon, although similar numbers of duplicates remained in both genomes. such differential retention of duplicate genes may have facilitated the isolation of nascent species formed during the vast radiation of teleosts and does not appear to be an exceptional phenomenon. moreover, it seems even a desired one to accomplish speciation.

phylogeny and duplications of plant rab <dig> proteins
many rab <dig> isoforms are also present in plant taxa. both protein- and gene-based phylogenies revealed clear duplications of rab <dig> genes that occurred in higher plants three times before divergence for monocots and eudicots giving three distinct rab <dig> lineages . the ml and bayesian trees based on nucleotide sequence revealed almost identical topologies with many strongly supported clades. apart from the early duplications of rab <dig> in the evolution of higher plants, successive duplications must have happened among eudicots and monocots because additional copies are present in arabidopsis thaliana , lotus corniculatus  and oryza sativa .

the unravelled duplications events could be correlated with small-, large- or whole genome duplications recognized in angiosperms evolution. analyses of arabidopsis thaliana genome revealed three rounds of wgd in its lineage: before monocot-eudicot divergence , after the divergence of monocots and eudicots , and after the divergence of brassicales and malvales, but prior to the divergence of arabidopsis and brassica   <cit> . early polyploidization before radiation of flowering plants was also found by cui et al.  <cit> . the observed split of rab <dig> gene lineages into three rab <dig> lineages each containing monocots and eudicots genes could be reminiscent of these early duplications. similarly, the clade comprising the medicago truncatula sequence and four non-monophyletic arabidopsis thaliana rab <dig> sequences in the rab <dig> lineage i may correspond to the duplication event  before eurosid divergence . finally, particular arabidopsis thaliana rab <dig> proteins cluster together in pairs in all three lineages, thus indicating that the most recent wgd  occurred in the course of its genome evolution. the two separated rab <dig> copies present in lotus corniculatus in the lineage i were probably retained after wgd which occurred early in legume evolution  <cit> . the presence of two oryza sativa rab <dig> sequences in the lineage i significantly separated by the sequence of horedum vulgare could be related with ancient wgd or other duplication events predating the divergence of the grass family  <cit> .

duplications of rab <dig> proteins in other eukaryotes
several lineage-specific duplications events can also be deduced for some unicellular eukaryotes . seven rab <dig> copies are present in trichomonas vaginalis. in this case all the copies form one unsupported clade branched to subsequent supported subclades. one of these includes the sequence of other excavate  which could suggest that the duplication may have happened before radiation of excavata for parabasalids and oxymonads. however, the identity of the sequence attributed to streblomastix strix may be dubious since the est library is highly contaminated with sequences from parabasalid species co-inhabiting the insect host together with oxymonad  <cit> . therefore it is very likely that its close relationship to trichomonas vaginalis sequences is best explained by a parabasalid rather than oxymonad provenance of this sequence.

ten rab <dig> proteins can be identified in entamoeba histolytica. most form one clade but only subclades show bootstrap support. two rab <dig> copies are present in schizosaccharomyces pombe and three in each of paramecium species  analysed so far. . however, duplicated sequences form a strongly supported clade only in the latter case. two amoebozoans acanthamoeba castellani and dictyostelium discoideum have four and three rab <dig> copies, respectively. in three cases the sequences of these two species are branched together, that suggests gene duplications before divergence of these lineages, although these clades do not have any bootstrap support. a very intriguing case is presented by two sequences of fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis that are very distant in the tree. this separation may result from the lba because one is very divergent.

similarly to metazoans and plants, the presence of many rab <dig> copies in some unicellular eukaryotes appeared as a result of wgd or other genome duplications that took place in a smaller scale. at least three successive whole-genome duplications occurred relatively recently in paramecium lineage  <cit>  and possibly one or more large-scale duplication events happened in trichomonas vaginalis genome  <cit> . relatively recent duplications were also reported for dictyostelium discoideum genome  <cit>  that seems to be especially susceptible to wgd  <cit> .

evolutionary consequences of rab duplications and their diversification
the presence of many rab duplicates and isoforms raises a question about potential evolutionary consequences of rab duplications. duplicated sequences usually evolve significantly faster than unduplicated genes with a similar level of divergence, showing an early phase of relaxed constraints is in agreement with the view that gene duplications are a source of new protein functions  <cit> . actually, we found that rab <dig>  rab7b, rab7c and some arabidopsis thaliana  sequences showed elevated levels of substitutions that can be related with gaining of a new function or subfunctionalization  <cit> .

since rab proteins are specialized to particular subcellular locations and functions, and several are tissue, organ- and developmental stage-specific, it was postulated that the diversification of rab genes correlates with multicellularity of organisms  <cit> . the emergence of rab <dig> before the radiation of metazoa could fit this assumption. however, relationships between the rab expansion and the multicellularity are not clear. the origin of rab <dig> proteins responsible for vesicular transport and lysosomal enzyme sorting from late endosomes to the trans-golgi network may have been an important step in improvement of digestion and degradation processes associated with phagocytosis, endocytosis, autophagy and apoptosis. similarly to cell adhesion and signalling proteins that are otherwise restricted to metazoans, rab <dig> was identified in one unicellular eukaryote,monosiga brevicolis, the closest known relative to metazoans whose genome was completely sequenced  <cit> . it implicates that the common ancestor of metazoans and choanoflagellates already possessed several of the critical structural components used in modern metazoa.

additional duplication of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins that occurred in the early evolution of vertebrates and subsequently in teleost fishes and tetrapods can be connected to the functional diversification of these genes in vertebrates. the duplicated rab might have acquired novel spatiotemporal roles related to expression in different cell types, to developmental stages or to environmental conditions. however, non-detailed functions or expression patterns for many rab paralogous genes in given lineages or species were conclusively specified. therefore, potential consequences of these rab duplications in evolution of vertebrates are not clear. the specialization of function was found only for rab7b isoforms identified in terrestrial vertebrates. rab7a proteins usually regulate vesicular traffic from early to late endosomes and from late endosome to vacuole/lysosome while the rab7b isoform regulates transport only to or from lysosomes. moreover, it is selectively expressed in monocytes and probably is involved in their differentiation  <cit> .

in order to estimate expected differences in expression profiles or levels of various rab genes, we gathered data on expression profiles from unigene database  <cit>  and compared fractions of ests between different rab isoforms or their duplicates. it should be noted that the expression data provide an approximate estimation of gene expression but are a good starting point for further investigations. nevertheless, the data in unigene expression profile of arabidopsis thaliana genes lead to the same conclusions as data obtained in more exact experiments by mazel a, et al.  <cit>  as mentioned below .

the comparisons clearly showed that rab9a proteins always exhibit higher expression levels than rab9b . similarly, rab7a isoforms showed significant higher number of ests than rab7b . since some species possess more than two rab <dig> copies, we performed separate pair-wise comparison of their est fraction . generally, these analyses also showed higher expression of rab7a genes than other isoforms. moreover, some variation of expression level was observed for different gene copies of the same rab <dig> isoform .

similarly, the existence of many duplicated rab <dig> isoforms in higher plants suggests their functional diversity. interestingly, despite its small size, the a. thaliana genome   <cit>  retained as many as eight genes after duplication events suggesting a selective advantage of this variation.

several experimental studies showed that duplicated rab <dig> genes contributed to adaptation of plants to different environmental conditions and particular rab <dig> copies acquired novel spatiotemporal roles and expression profiles. borg et al.  <cit>  found in lotus japonicus that among four rab <dig> genes, two of them  are preferably expressed in leaves, one  is most abundantly expressed in root nodules especially in middle stages of development and the fourth  is constitutively expressed, representing a putative house-keeping gene. mazel et al.  <cit>  reported that one of the arabidopsis thaliana rab <dig> genes  showed higher expression in older roots and was induced during programmed cell death after treatment of intact leaves with superoxide and salicylic acid or infection with necrogenic pathogens. transgenic plants that expressed this gene also showed increased tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses and a reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species during salt stress. it was also found that expression of rab <dig> gene both from oryza sativa  and pennisetum glaucum  was differentially regulated by various environmental stimuli such as cold, nacl, dehydration and plant hormones  <cit> . overexpression of pgrab <dig> gene enhanced tolerance to both ionic and osmotic stress in transgenic tobacco. it seems that at least some rab <dig> isoforms are involved in developing tolerance towards salinity and dehydration in plants.

our comparisons of plant est fractions also showed differentiated expression profiles. we observed interesting relationships between the est number of plant rab <dig> proteins and the assignment of a given gene to a particular phylogenetic lineage . highest expression levels show genes clustered in the lineage  <dig>  moderate levels show genes grouped in the lineage  <dig> and the lowest levels genes from the lineage  <dig>  moreover, we observed some organ-dependent expression patterns. the gene at. <dig> has a significantly  higher number of ests isolated from root than the gene at. <dig>  although these genes show indistinguishable global expression level  and belong to the same phylogenetic lineage. some organ-dependence expression pattern is indicated in this case. actually, mazel et al.  <cit>  found the higher expression of the former gene in roots.

less clear are expansions of rab <dig> proteins in unicellular eukaryotes. several explanations were proposed with reference to the whole rab family  <cit> . many rab <dig> copies can be the result of large or whole genome duplication events and can be correlated with a highly complex endomembrane system or amoeboid lifestyle. moreover, this phenomenon could be associated with the different possible substrates that are endocytosed by the parasite requiring a larger number of distinct cargo adaptors. on the other hand, the expansion of rab <dig> proteins in single celled eukaryotes may be due to generation of diversity at the genome level instead of the transcriptome level since introns giving rise to different protein products by alternative splicing are rare in majority of these cells. these unique rab gtpases may represent lineage-specific innovations similar to some other proteins involved in endocytosis  <cit> .

rab <dig> genes present in genomes of unicellular eukaryotes probably diversified into functionally and spatiotemporally different isoforms. such a case was experimentally proven in entamoeba histolytica  <cit>  in which two rab <dig> isotypes, ehrab7a and ehrab7b, showed distinct localisation and roles in biogenesis of lysosomes and phagosomes. ehrab7b is localised to late endosomes/lysosome and is involved in the formation and/or fusion to lysosomes, whereas ehrab7a is associated with the post-golgi compartment containing cargos destined for lysosomes, and involved in fusion to late endosomes. moreover, ehrab <dig> isotypes  showed remarkable time- and stage-dependent recruitment to phagosomes during maturation indicating their sequential and coordinated influence on phagosome biogenesis.

additionally, some other factors should be considered in the case of parasitic unicellular eukaryotes such as adaptive pressure that may increase the number of unique protein families including also that of rab proteins. trypanosomatid genomes encode approximately  <dig> rab proteins including a group of three trypanosomatid unique rabs and their functions have not been fully elucidated  <cit> . the authors point out to adaptive pressures placed upon these organisms to meet the demands of specialized host environments as well as a deep divergence due to early separation from model systems.

since rab proteins are important components of the endocytic network and are regulatory and signalling proteins interacting with many other proteins, the preservation of many copies is well suited to 'gene-balance' or a dosage constraint hypothesis. this hypothesis states that dosage-sensitive genes are preferentially retained after whole genome duplications rather than in cumulative small-scale gene duplications, especially if these genes cooperate in the same complex regulatory or interaction pathway and network  <cit> . in agreement with that aury and coworkers  <cit>  observed a clear co-retention of rab gtp-ases with gtpase activating proteins .

our results indicate that new groups and paralogous of rab7/rab <dig> proteins emerged in the course of evolution of many lineages. some rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins acquired new experimentally proven specialized functions. the results also showed clear differences in expression between genes of particular subgroups of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins. however, additional experimental studies are required to determine detailed function for the particular rab <dig> and rab <dig> gene copies and to further assess the relationship between their expression and tissue, organ or development stage.

structural features of rab <dig> and rab <dig> sequences
in order to compare structural elements in sequences of different subgroups of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins we aligned consensus sequences generated from hmm profiles based on respective multiple sequence alignments . in this study we compared ten sets of the following proteins: rab <dig>  rab7c, rab7b and rab7a dividing them into seven taxonomic subgroups. in figure  <dig> we highlighted different conserved and unique sequence elements, motifs and sites that are responsible for interactions of rab proteins with various regulators and effectors .

ras- and rab-conserved motifs
the most conserved regions, present not only in rab proteins but also in other members of the ras superfamily, contain six motifs: three  involved in guanine nucleotide binding and three  responsible for binding and coordination magnesium ion with phosphates groups. these motifs are also conserved across the analysed sequences. almost 85% of their sites are occupied by residues conserved in 100% across the alignment according to the blosum <dig> matrix. extensive comparative sequence analysis revealed also the presence of five rab-conserved motifs , which may be used to designate this family  <cit> . in the analysed set, almost 60% of their sites are occupied by 100%-conserved residues. some deviations from the full conservation observed in conserved motifs concern in almost all cases the substitutions that do not change the properties of the amino acid residues. the rabf <dig>  -f <dig> and -f <dig> motifs are placed in two switch regions or in their neighbourhood. the regions are characteristic for small gtpases and correspond to flexible domains  that substantially change their conformation upon exchange between gdp and gtp.

regions specific for particular rab subfamilies
apart from the regions conserved for all rab proteins, four other regions specific for particular subfamilies of rab were identified  <cit> . they were named rabsf <dig> to rabsf <dig>  these motifs show clear variation between rab subfamilies and can be regarded as unique characteristics for each rab subfamily. both rabf and rabsf motifs are involved in simultaneous interaction with different regulators and effectors. it is postulated that they bind to rabf regions to discriminate between active/inactive nucleotide-bound conformations and simultaneously interact with rabsf regions for specificity. determination of several structures of rab proteins with their regulators or effectors revealed that in such interactions participate switch and interswitch regions, rabsf <dig>  -sf <dig> motifs and cdrs   <cit> . moreover, all four rabsfs, rabf <dig> and -f <dig> motifs turned out to be important in correct subcellular targeting and functioning of many rab gtpases in hybrid experiments exchanging these domains between different rab proteins  <cit> . therefore, we should expect potential differences between subgroups of rab7/rab <dig> proteins just in these above mentioned regions. actually, in the analysed set, only 32% of rabsf <dig>  rabsf <dig> and rabsf <dig> sites are occupied by 100%-conserved residues and none in the case of rabsf <dig>  moreover, the cdrs also show a very low level of conservation across the analysed alignment .

in figure  <dig> we also marked seven regions, numbered from i to vii that show substantial conformational variation among structures of rab proteins when superimposed with rab <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig> includes also marked sites involved in interaction with regulators and effectors  <cit> . they usually fall into less conserved regions in the alignment. 100% conserved-sites constitute only 23% of the former regions and 38% of the sites involved in the interactions. such variation suggests that these less conserved sites may be responsible for interaction with different regulators or effectors and differentiation of rab functions.

c-terminal region
rab proteins exhibit also a characteristic c-terminal prenylation motif that differs from the motifs found in ras and rho families, i.e. caax, where c denote cysteine, a – aliphatic residue and x – any residue  <cit> . the majority of rab prenylation motifs, needed for the addition of geranylgeranyl groups and attachment of a protein to a membrane, occur in one of the exemplary combinations: xxcc, xccx, ccxx, ccxxx or xcxc. such two cysteines motifs were also found in all full rab sequences analysed in this study. interestingly, most amoebozoan rab7a proteins, all rab7b and all rab <dig> sequences possessed motifs with two immediately adjacent cysteines while most sequences of other groups usually comprised motifs with cs separated by one not conserved residue.

immediately upstream of the prenylation site is located an unstructured hypervariable domain , that contains the rabsf <dig> motif and shows the highest level of sequence divergence among rab proteins  <cit> . this region is also poorly conserved in analysed subgroups of rab7/rab <dig> proteins and is quite short . it is assumed that shorter domains are bound more tightly to the surface of gdi . the only conserved sites in the hvd region are occupied by two hydrophobic residues  <cit> . they make important contacts of ypt <dig> with gdi  <cit>  and rab <dig> with rep <dig>  an escort protein responsible for delivery of the gdp-rab to an appropriate membrane  <cit> . such two hydrophobic residues were found by us in the analysed sequences of rab7/rab <dig> proteins. other interesting features of hvd is its high content of glycine and proline residues, that contribute to helix breakage and are responsible for generation of the extended structure important for gdi binding  <cit> , prenylation of rab gtpases  <cit>  and probably other protein interactions. interestingly, such residues are moderately present only in rab7a proteins upstream of two hydrophobic residues and prenylation motifs but are absent from consensuses of rab7b, rab7c and rab <dig> proteins.

the great variation of hvd suggests that this region is pivotal for rab proteins localisation  <cit> . actually, hybrid experiments replacing the region between different rab proteins showed their incorrect targeting  <cit> . however, recent analyses revealed that the hypervariable region did not represent a general targeting domain and the rab-effectors/regulators interaction is likely more complex and involves additional domains  <cit> .

sites discriminating different subgroups of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins
detailed inspection of the alignment enabled us to identify individual sites containing non-conservative substitutions discriminating rab <dig> and rab <dig> subfamilies. for example, position  <dig> in the rab <dig> consensus is occupied by aspartic acid whereas in rab <dig> dominate hydroxylated residues. moreover, hydrophobic and aromatic phenylalanine at position  <dig> of rab <dig> consensus aligns with polar, mostly basic residues while valine at position  <dig> corresponds to prolines in other rab proteins. rab7b and rab7c proteins contain at position  <dig> aspartic acid and histidine, negatively- and positively-charged residues, respectively, while other subgroups comprise uncharged, hydrophobic leucine. furthermore, basic histidine at position  <dig> of rab <dig> gtpases is aligned with small polar threonine of rab7b consensus while tiny alanines are present in consensuses of other subgroups. similarly, at position  <dig> of rab <dig> consensus is basic arginine, whereas this position is occupied by hydrophobic valine in rab7b proteins and by glycine in other subgroups. the residues discriminating rab <dig> are placed in switch regions. in agreement, the greatest structural dissimilarity between rab <dig> and rab <dig> structures was just found in active switch conformations  <cit> .

wittmann and rudolph  <cit>  and lal et al.  <cit>  identified in cdrii/rabsf <dig> region four-residue insertion in rab <dig> and rab <dig> gtpases compared to other rab proteins. the insertion renders the loop in this region more flexible  <cit> . however, the insertion can not be a unique feature of rab <dig> and rab <dig> proteins because we found it also in rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig> gtpases that are closely related to them. on the other hand, rab7b proteins have a unique deletion  at position  <dig> in comparison with other subgroups.

based on the rab records retrieved from the pdb database  <cit>  we calculated consensuses of secondary structure for rab7a and rab <dig> proteins . the only significant difference concerns the presence of the short α-helix flanked by 310-helices in the switch ii region of rab <dig>  due to such a structure a hydrophobic tetrad is formed resembling an effector-discriminating epitope  <cit> . this tetrad may contribute to differentiated recognition of effectors by these proteins.

the signal for the specific role and localisation of various rab proteins is probably complex, involves many regions and could be achieved by relatively small differences in their structures. the identified non-conserved regions and structural dissimilarities of rab7/rab <dig> proteins may be a good starting point to further functional and structural studies.

CONCLUSIONS
rab <dig> proteins are widely distributed in almost all supergroups of eukaryota and likely evolved before the radiation of eukaryotes. rab <dig> proteins have more narrow taxonomic distribution and diverged from rab <dig> gtpases before divergence of choanoflagellates and metazoans. the rab proteins were additionally duplicated in vertebrates  and in higher plants . interestingly, some representatives of excavates, ciliates and amoebozoans also comprise a substantial number of rab <dig> copies. the emergence of the rab <dig> subfamily and the subsequent duplication of genes encoding rab <dig> and rab <dig> may suggest their functional diversification and specialization. actually, for some of these proteins such functions were already found and distinct expression levels were determined for different rab genes. apart from preserved conserved regions and motifs typical of rab family, rab7/rab <dig> proteins have non-conserved sequences and structural features, that may be responsible for diversification of their functions and interactions with effectors and regulators. rab7/rab <dig> gtpases show concordant diversification at the phylogenetic, expression and sequence/structural levels. the obtained results are good starting point to further detail experimental studies which should fully determine functional specialization of these gtpases and relationship of their expression to tissue, organ, development stage or environmental response.
