BACKGROUND
determining function of a protein is one of the most challenging problems of the post-genomic era. in past various techniques have been developed for predicting the function of proteins using information derived from sequence similarity or clustering patterns of co-regulated genes, interaction of protein etc. it is important to understand interaction of protein with other proteins or ligands in order to understand it function. one of most important ligands among the molecules that interact with proteins is nucleotide. prediction of proteins and nucleotide interaction can be divided in two categories  short nucleotide interaction, where short nucleotide  interacts with proteins  polynucleotide interactions, where polynucleotide  interacts with proteins.

many proteins use small nucleotides as a source of energy and signaling molecules inside the cell . the flavin and nicotinamide nucleotides work as electron donor/acceptors in lots of cellular metabolic reactions. fad is a redox cofactor involved in several important reactions in metabolism. living organism mostly generate energy by using glucose or fat molecules, both metabolic pathway regulated by enzyme which prosthetic group is fad. thus, identification of fad interacting residue  is very important in molecular recognition. despite tremendous progress in the annotation of protein, there is no any existing online tools are available for the prediction of fir using primary sequence. experimental method to identify fir is very difficult and time consuming process and also very costly. we can easily identify either fad interact with protein or not by using absorption spectra but can't identify which residues are firs.

in the past large number of tools have been developed for the prediction of polynucleotide  interacting residues using different machine learning techniques  <cit> . in contrast there has been only one preexisting method available for the prediction of small nucleotide-protein interaction, developed by saito et al  <cit> . they developed method for small nucleotide binding site prediction using empirical score approach and detect 40% fad binding sites correctly. saito et al. methods only give us idea about binding site but can't give information about the fad interacting residues. kallberg et al.  <cit>  used simple sequence in hidden markov model and developed method for identifying rossmann folds and predict there coenzyme specificity  and found that fad least preferred cofactor. so there studies suggest that fad interacting residues can't predict easily. thus, the development of computational method for predicting fir in a protein from its amino acid sequence is very important for functional annotation of proteins.

in this work, a systematic attempt has been made to predict firs in a protein sequences using binary pattern and pssm profiles of  <dig> firs and non-firs of  <dig> non-redundant protein chains. in first step fbp chain were analyzed, then svm model were developed by using binary pattern of firs. it have been observed in past that evolutionary information provide more information, thus we developed svm models using pssm profiles obtained from psi-blast  <cit> . all models developed in this study were evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique. fadpred can directly predict the fad interacting residues using binary pattern of sequence and its evolutionary information. our server will be useful for experimental biologists working on flavoproteins/flavoenzymes.

methods
dataset
in first step of data collection we use supersite documentation  <cit>  and extract  <dig> pdb ids of protein having contact with fad in pdb. we download the sequence of all chains of these pdb ids using web download section in pdb. in next step we use these pdb ids in ligand protein contact   <cit>  and get total  <dig> chain which interacts with fad with their corresponding interacting residues and its position. then we remove redundant chains which have more than 40% similarity by using cd-hit  <cit> , finally retrieved a total  <dig> interacting chains with a total  <dig> firs remaining all residues are non-firs. in this study we used  <dig> firs and  <dig> non-firs for developing our models. sequences of these  <dig> fbp with their pdb id and chain name are freely available  <cit> , where firs are in lowercase and non-firs are in uppercase.

five-fold cross-validation
fivefold cross-validation technique has been used to evaluate the performance of all the models developed in this study. in this technique dataset is randomly divided into five sets where each set consist of nearly equal number of interacting and non-interacting patterns out of these five sets four sets are used for training and the remaining set for testing. this process is repeated five times in such a way that each set is used once for testing. the final performance is obtained by averaging the performance of all the five sets.

pattern or window size
we generated an overlapping pattern of  <dig> residues, for each fad interacting chains sequences. if the central residue of pattern was fir, then we classified the pattern as positive or fir pattern, otherwise it was termed as non-interacting or negative pattern. in this study we follow the similar approach adopted by kaur and raghava  <cit>  for prediction of turns in protein sequences. in additional to  <dig> residue window we also generate pattern of  <dig> and  <dig> residues. in this study we used unique residue patterns for binary and pssm pattern generation. finally we have total  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique pattern for interacting residues respectively in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> residue window, and randomly picked equal number of non-interacting pattern as negative data.

support vector machine 
an excellent machine learning technique svm  <cit>  has been used for the prediction of firs. all svm models have been developed by using a freely available package svm_light  <cit> . the svm is particularly attractive to biological sequence analysis due to its ability to handle noise, dataset and large input space. further details about svm can be obtained from vapnik's  <cit>  paper. the software allows users to run svm using various numbers of parameters as well as to select inbuilt kernel functions, including a linear, polynomial and radial basis function .

evolutionary information
this was obtained from position-specific scoring matrix  generated from psi-blast search against non-redundant  database  <cit>  of protein sequences. the pssm matrix was generated by three iterations of searching at cutoff e-value of  <dig>  for inclusion of sequences in next iteration. the generated pssm contained the probability of occurrence of each type of amino acid at each position along with insertion/deletion. hence, pssm is considered as a measure of residue conservation in a given location. this means that evolutionary information for each amino acid is encapsulated in a vector of  <dig> dimensions where the size of pssm matrix of a protein with n residues is  <dig> Ã— n. where  <dig> dimension are  <dig> standard amino acids. we normalized each value within 0- <dig> range using equation:  

where val is the pssm score and val is its normalized value.

figure of merits
in this study performance of constructed modules has been evaluated by using five-fold cross-validation techniques. following threshold dependent parameters: sensitivity  or percent coverage of fir is the percentage of fir residue predicted as fir; specificity  or percent coverage of non-interacting residues is the percentage of non-fir predicted as non-fir; overall accuracy  is the percentage of correctly predicted interacting residues has been used for assessing the performance of method. these parameters can be using following equations:            

where tp is correctly predicted firs, tn is correctly predicted non-firs, fp is the number of non-firs predicted as fir and fn is the number of firs wrongly predicted as non-fir. matthew's correlation coefficient  equal to  <dig> is regarded as a perfect prediction, whereas  <dig> is for completely random prediction. we also calculated auc of roc plot which is a threshold independent parameter.

description of web server
the prediction method described in this paper is implemented in the form of a web-server fadpred  <cit> . the common gateway interface  script of fadpred is written using perl version  <dig> . fadpred server is installed on a sun server  under unix  environment. it is a user-friendly web server which allows users to submit their protein sequence in two different ways; first browse and upload the fasta sequence file and second, either type or paste fasta sequence in a box which is available on submit page. this server allows users to predict fad binding residues using both binary pattern and pssm based svm models with different threshold range from - <dig> - + <dig>  here we provide option for both binary pattern and pssm user can select according to their choice and get the result through mail also. the default method is pssm and threshold is  <dig> , sensitivity and specificity is roughly found to equal during the five-fold cross-validation procedure at this threshold. the prediction result presented in graphical form where the predicted firs and non-firs are displayed in different color. we are using pssm as default option and it takes several minutes to predict fad interacting residues in a protein.

RESULTS
compositional analysis
we calculated the percentage composition of interacting and non-interacting residues and found gly, tyr and ser residues were more abundantly interact with fad as compare to non-interacting residues . the dominance of these residues shows a vital role of these residues in fad interaction.

svm model using binary pattern of amino acid sequence
in our study we generated multiple  <dig> residue long window for negative and positive pattern. these sequence patterns were converted to binary patterns, where a pattern of length n was represented by a vector of dimension n Ã—  <dig> and each amino acid in that pattern was represented by a vector of  <dig>  which contained  <dig> amino acids and one dummy amino acid x. as shown in table  <dig>  this svm-based model was able to give a maximum mcc of  <dig>  with  <dig> % accuracy having minimum difference in sensitivity and specificity. threshold at which sensitivity and specificity is nearly same is shown by bold font, in order to balance sensitivity and specificity. similarly we achieved accuracy  <dig> % with mcc of  <dig>  for  <dig> window patterns and accuracy  <dig>  with mcc of  <dig>  for  <dig> window patterns. aucs are  <dig> ,  <dig>  &  <dig>  respectively for  <dig> window,  <dig> window and  <dig> window pattern models . the performances of models were evaluated at residue level.

svm model using evolutionary information
in the past, it has been shown in several studies that evolutionary information obtained using multiple sequence alignment provides more comprehensive information about the protein than a single sequence  <cit> . in this study, the evolutionary information obtained from pssm generated from psi-blast profiles was used for predicting firs. as shown in table  <dig>  performance increased significantly when pssm was used as input instead of single sequence. a maximum mcc of  <dig>  was achieved with  <dig> % accuracy using evolutionary information. similarly we achieved accuracy  <dig>  with mcc of  <dig>  for  <dig> window patterns and accuracy  <dig>  with mcc of  <dig>  for  <dig> window patterns. aucs are  <dig> ,  <dig>  &  <dig>  respectively for  <dig> window,  <dig> window and  <dig> window pattern models .

discussion
due to the vital roles of fad binding proteins in cellular metabolism and difficulties in iv-vitro analysis or identification of firs, by biophysical method, there is as urgent need for computational method to identify fad binding sites on the basis of amino acid sequence of a protein. in this direction, we had followed a systematic attempt to develop a highly accurate and robust method for predicting fad binding residues in protein sequences. there is no any preexisting online method in our knowledge for the prediction of firs using primary sequence. so first of all we developed method for predicting firs using sequence of fbp proteins. for this study firstly we collect the information of fad binding proteins pdb ids with supersite, fasta sequence from pdb and fad interacting residues using lpc. then analyze firs and found that there is significant difference in interacting residues as well as flanking residues.

it has been reported in some of the earlier studies that svm perform better than any other artificial intelligence  techniques in interacting residue prediction. first we developed svm model based on binary patterns of amino acid sequence. manish et al.  <dig> showed that evolutionary information perform better than simple sequence information in interacting residue prediction. further we used evolutionary information to generate pssm profile as input for svm model and check overall performance of firs prediction. svm parameter for each model with their auc is given in table  <dig>  one of the obvious questions is why we can't use blast for predicting firs. thus we also make an attempt to predict fad interacting residues using blast and achieved very poor performance . we also provide a direct access of our developed prediction method to public, through web server fadpred. fadpred allow users to predict fad interacting residues in their protein sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study first, time a highly robust method has been developed to predict fad interacting residues from protein sequence using ai technique, svm. this study demonstrates that pssm based method performs better than simple sequence based method. in this study we also observed that  <dig> window pattern perform better than  <dig> and  <dig> window pattern . this study will be helpful for biologist in proteome annotation. one of the major advantage of this study is that we developed free web server; fadpred. our web server allows users to identify fad interacting residue in given sequence using the model trained on our data set.
