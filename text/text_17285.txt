BACKGROUND
in modern organisms, dna is the major genetic material and protein is the major functional material, both seeming indispensible. thus, there is a dilemma for the evolution of life: “which came first, dna or proteins?” the rna world hypothesis provided a possible solution to this problem: in some early stage of life, there is neither dna nor protein but only rna, acting as both genetic material and functional material  <cit> . the rna world hypothesis has gain more and more supporting evidence, and has become the most popular idea in the field of the origin of life . indeed, in reality, peptides are likely to have existed in the rna world, considering that they may have been easy to synthesize prebiotically and may have been able to aid rna’s function by forming complexes with rna  <cit> . however, these peptides, synthesized abiotically, cannot reappear in the next generation anyway . thus, the stage was still an “rna world”, considering chemical existence is not sufficient to “justify” the existence of a substance in a living world . recently, a significant study suggested that precursors of rna, proteins and lipids may have derived by common chemistry  <cit>  – while the result was inspiring for researchers working in the field of the origin of life, a clear notion concerning the difference between chemical existence and biotic existence, like mentioned here, becomes particularly important.

as a clear consequence of the scenario concerning the rna world, dna and proteins  should have appeared afterwards. for the emergence of dna, there would be a problem of “genetic takeover”; for the emergence of proteins, there would be a problem of “functional takeover”. indeed, “after rna, which came first, dna or proteins?” is still a question . while problems concerning such critical transitions remain difficult to tackle experimentally, they begin to appear within the reach of computer simulation researches.

the present computer simulation study focuses on the genetic takeover and follows the idea of dna emerging before proteins. perhaps the authors’ own opinions about the emerging order of dna and proteins are not important here, and the choice could simply be technical: the genetic takeover is simpler in principle than the functional takeover given that rna and dna share the same mechanism in their synthesis, i.e., by base pairing . in particular, we have conducted a series of computer simulation studies concerning the scenario of early development of the rna world, including the emergence of several important ribozymes , the cooperation of these ribozymes  <cit> , and the emergence of an rna “chromosome”   <cit> . in fact, it is now feasible, by a slight extension of the approach along this line, to investigate “the emergence of a dna chromosome” – ultimately, the transition from an rna world to a dna/rna world.

indeed, for this transition to occur, additional functions concerning new kinds of template-directed copying should be required, i.e., the cross copying between dna and rna as well as dna’s replication. however, these new kinds of copying may have been initially catalyzed by that “old” ribozyme, i.e., the ribozyme that catalyzed rna’s own replication   <cit> , given the similar chemistry behind all these reactions  <cit> . other than this, it appears that only a nucleotide reductase ribozyme , which synthesizes deoxynucleotides from nucleotides, is needed  <cit> . therefore, here we could start our simulation study simply with the introduction of such a ribozyme. our concerns are: could the so-called genetic takeover take place in our model system? if it could, what about its mechanisms? .

RESULTS
practically, the present model was derived directly from the one used in our recent study  <cit> , in which the system was distributed with protocells containing an rna chromosome and several ribozymes it codes, i.e., a rep, a nucleotide synthetase ribozyme , a nucleotide precursor synthetase ribozyme , and an amphiphile  synthetase ribozyme . here the simulation study started with the introduction of a fifth ribozyme, an nrr. see “methods” for a detailed description of the model.

the influence of a moderate nucleotide reductase ribozyme
the rna chromosome now has five genes. however, to trace the effect of the nrr gene, it is first assumed that the ribozyme nrr cannot work . after the initial inoculation , the chromosome and the ribozymes, as well as the protocells containing them, spread  in the system , which is consistent with our previous study  <cit> . however, some time later , the chromosome  begins to decrease while the chromosome lacking the nrr gene  begins to increase, which, taken together, mean the “losing” of the nrr gene. a similar trend can be observed at the cellular level . indeed, the ribozyme nrr  also decreases. finally, the nrr gene goes into extinction . this “phenomenon” is well consistent with our understandings that a non-functional sequence would not be conserved .table  <dig> parameters used in the model

nrr is changed from  <dig> to   <dig> ;   <dig> ;   <dig> . for each subfigure, the top panel shows the dynamics at the molecular level, and the bottom panel the cellular level. stars represent the chromosome  containing all the five genes, while x-shapes represent the chromosome  containing only four genes . the black dashed line denotes the total materials concerning rna, including rna, nucleotides, nucleotide precursors and nucleotide precursors’ precursors ; and in a similar way the red dashed line denotes the total materials concerning dna. dots represent the ribozymes . empty circles represent total protocells, and the circles with a symbol in represent the protocells containing the chromosome represented by that symbol . note that the symbols in the following dynamic figures are interpreted the same way



in the model, dna is assumed to bear several virtues relative to rna  according to our knowledge. first, dna is more stable against chain break  <cit>  . second, dna is easier to act as a template  . third, dna is less error-prone in replication  <cit>  . here, the consideration that the mutation rate for dna replication should be lower than that of rna replication is relevant to their template feature , and so the difference could not be very great  <cit> . note that dna or rna may act as a copying template for each other; and the rep is assumed to be able to aid all the four kinds of copying: rna to rna, rna to dna, dna to dna and dna to rna . then, our concern is: if the activity of nrr is “turned on”, would a genetic takeover occur? correlatively, given its function favoring the emergence of dna, would the nrr’s extinction be prevented?

the active rate of nrr, pnrr is changed from  <dig> to  <dig>   at a step before the nrr gene begin to fade away . somewhat unexpectedly, the system collapses directly after this “key step” . the number of the rna chromosome  drops immediately while the dna chromosome  rises. the rna material as a whole  drops while the dna material  rises. significantly, the ribozymes  decrease meanwhile. in other words, the nrr could cause the rise of dna, but would lead to the drop of rna, which includes the indispensible ribozymes – thus resulting in the system’s collapse. when the system collapse, the rna material and the dna material take a trend towards the same level – this is a reasonable result because given no “biotic” effect is available, the balance is determined by those “abiotic” rates, the non-enzymatic “inter-transforming” rates between nucleotides and deoxynucleotides, between nucleotide precursors and deoxynucleotide precursors, and between nucleotide precursors’ precursors and deoxynucleotide precursors’ precursors, which are in this case set to be equal respectively .

in reality, a deleterious gene would appear through mutation in an individual, and the result, at most, may be the elimination of the individual together with the gene in the population, rather than a system-wide collapse. clearly, by the way of dynamic simulation as shown here, it would be hard to judge such gene elimination concerning single mutants, because if an individual disappears, the disappearance may also be caused by some random event. however, we may do a “conservative simulation” to show the phenomenon. for the case shown in fig. 1a, if pnrr is changed from  <dig> to  <dig>  at step  <dig>  ×  <dig> – when only a portion of the chromosome molecules still maintain the sequence of the nrr gene, we can see the gene-elimination phenomenon , in which the nrr’s extinction is accelerated . the logic to say this is a conservative simulation is that the deleterious gene would be eliminated from the system even if a number of individuals contain it, let alone in the case that it appears within only one individual through mutation. on the other side of the coin, we get to know that the reason for the system-wide collapse shown in fig. 1b is that the “deleterious gene” is here “applied suddenly” on a globe scale – i.e., in all individuals , and no individual escapes from the elimination.fig.  <dig> several cases showing the dynamics of the model system when the nrr’s effect is not “applied on a global scale”. based on the case shown in fig. 1a, at step  <dig>  ×  <dig>  p
nrr is changed from  <dig> to   <dig> ;   <dig> . based on the case shown in b,  at step  <dig>  ×  <dig>  f
sfr is changed from  <dig> to 10;  at step  <dig>  ×  <dig>  p
bbr is changed from 2 × 10− <dig> to 2 × 10− <dig>  note that at step  <dig>  ×  <dig>  due to random mutation, apparently only a portion of the rna chromosome molecules maintains the “non-functional” nrr gene . so when the activity of the nrr is turned on at this moment, the nrr’s effect is only “applied on a limited scale”. the thorough genetic takeover shown in d is in fact originated from a single individual, because at step  <dig>  ×  <dig> in this case there are actually only one protocell containing the five-gene chromosome, which bears the moderate nrr gene



does the system collapse or the gene elimination result from the high active rate of nrr ? obviously, nrr is not a pure “bad” gene given that it favors the synthesis of dna, a better genetic material. so then, lower active rates were tested here. indeed, when pnrr is changed from  <dig> to  <dig>   at the “key” step , the result turns out with an appearance somewhat closed to the genetic takeover we expected . a “platform” sustains for quite a long time, in which the five-gene dna chromosome  co-exists with the five-gene rna chromosome  . however, then  these chromosomes begin to descend, while the four-gene rna chromosome  begins to rise . this means that the transition is still unstable, and might turn back towards the pure rna system. this is no longer a problem related to the nrr’s active rate – with a greater rate the gene would appear too deleterious, whereas with a lower rate the gene would be too “weak” with regard to its benefit side .

towards a thorough genetic takeover
it seems that the unstability of the transition stems from the “counterattack” of the four-gene rna-based individuals, which though lacking a better genetic material, did not have to endure a shortage of building blocks for ribozymes. indeed, when the template activity of rna is turned down deliberately , which means that an rna chromosome is further disfavored, the four-gene rna chromosome no longer rises and the dna/rna platform is saved . moreover, the five-gene dna chromosome  ascends to a level higher than the five-gene rna chromosome  . indeed, this represents a veritable genetic takeover – the dna chromosome could already sustain itself along by replication . however, the rna chromosome would not disappear – it would be mainly copied from the dna chromosome ; thus, rather than a chromosome, it is, to a greater extent, a transcript of the dna chromosome .fig.  <dig> the stabilization of the dna/rna platform that is brought about by the moderate nrr. based on the case shown in fig. 1c, at step  <dig>  ×  <dig>   f
sfr is changed from  <dig> to  <dig> ;  p
bbr is changed from 2 × 10− <dig> to 2 × 10− <dig> 



imaginably, just due to the competition from the individuals around that lacked nrr, in reality, a mutant with the moderate nrr might hardly bring about a “system-wide” platform. as a relevant case of “conservative simulation”, the global effect cannot appear even if more than half of the individuals in the system get the function simultaneously . nonetheless, “local sparks” of the moderate nrr should still be significant for potential genetic takeover – indeed, their effect can spread to a global scale if rna’s template activity is turned down . it seems that what they are waiting is simply a chance, when the dna chromosome’s advantage over the rna chromosome is enhanced.

in this regard, though it seems difficult to tell what kinds of event in reality may attenuate rna’s template activity , we can easily imagine the environmental changes that disfavor the fragile rna chromosome, e.g., the rise of temperature or ph value. to simulate such a change, the chain-breaking rate of rna is turned up, i.e., pbbr is changed from 2 × 10− <dig> to 2 × 10− <dig> at step  <dig>  ×  <dig> based on the case shown in fig. 1c. note that the chain-breaking rate of dna  is here in effect turned up in an identical scale, which is a conservative assumption considering such a environmental change should be more detrimental to rna. nonetheless, the dna chromosome  is apparently favored , resulting in a stable platform, which represents a veritable genetic takeover . interestingly and significantly, fig. 2d shows that such a genetic takeover can originate from a single “individual” harboring the moderate nrr.

it was suggested that the early rna world may have occurred in freezing conditions  <cit>  – however, surely such a cold environment could not have last forever. alternatively, the accomplishment of the genetic takeover may have been driven by the gradual rise of ph value, as described in a hypothesis which proposes that the rna world originated in an ancient acidic ocean  <cit> . even if such an environment change did not happen in the “native habitat”, they could have been associated with “ecological migrations”. for example, as it was described in the “hot-cross origin” hypothesis  <cit> , dna may have been invented when “rna creatures” in cool seawater attempted to reach for the hydrothermal vents at seafloor, which harbor more “nutrients”  but bear an obviously higher temperature. we could envision that in such a scenario, many attempts may have not been successful until once upon a time one mutant carrying a gene of some moderate nrr joined the migration.

although the reinforcement of the genetic takeover might have been aided by the alteration of environments, the ultimate irreversibility of the genetic takeover should have arisen accompanying the increase of the genome length, which favored dna as an internal cause. for example, according the “hot-cross origin” scenario  <cit> , with dna as their genetic material, the creatures at the hydrothermal vents may have developed to a very complex and advanced extent, so that when they came back to the cooler environment, they eliminated the original rna inhabitants there. obviously, for the comeback creatures, an rna genome would no longer be capable of sustaining their complex living systems.

corresponding to the ensuing evolution described above, an advanced system depending on dna was modeled here. the “gene” lengths of rep, nsr, npsr and arr were changed from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides , with their corresponding ribozymes’ activities  enhanced from  <dig>  to  <dig> . because nrr should keep moderate in activity, it was assumed not evolved, its gene remaining 8 nt long and its rate remaining  <dig>  . with a longer genome, rna’s template activity should be lower due to its self-folding feature  <cit> , and so fsfr was changed from  <dig> to  <dig>  additionally, total raw material for nucleic acids introduced in the beginning  was increased from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to 2 ×  <dig>  after the initial inoculation, the protocells contains the dna chromosome and the ribozymes spread in the system unambiguously . when the nrr’s activity is turned off, with a transient rise of the rna material  and a simultaneous drop of the dna material , the system collapses , which means that the advanced system is indeed supported by the dna chromosome and the genetic takeover is no longer reversible. that is a thorough genetic takeover.fig.  <dig> about the causes for the genetic takeover in evolution. based on the case show in , which represents an advanced system supported by a dna genome , at step 2 ×  <dig>   f

fpdd is changed from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ;  f
bbd is changed from  <dig>  to  <dig> 



why genetic takeover – from rna to dna?
dna’s virtues , i.e., higher stability against hydrolysis  <cit> , better properties as templates  <cit>  and higher fidelity in replication  <cit> , may have accounted for the “dynamic driving force” of the genetic takeover . however, a really significant problem is whether these virtues could have contributed to the emergence of larger genomes  and thus accounted for the significance of the genetic takeover in evolution.

based on the dna-supported advanced system with a larger genome that we have modeled , it becomes possible to analyze this problem in a reverse way – by “knocking off” one of the virtues each time. indeed, when fsfd is changed from  <dig> to  <dig>  i.e., the template activity of dna is turned down to be equal to that of rna in the primordial system , the system collapses immediately ; when pfpdd is changed from  <dig>  to  <dig> , i.e., the fidelity of dna replication is turned down to be equal to that of rna , the system collapses immediately ; when fbbd is changed from  <dig>  to  <dig>  i.e., dna becomes equal to rna in stability, the system collapses too . that is to say, these three distinct virtues are, each in its own way, all important for dna to sustain an advanced system with a larger genome , so thus they should, all together, have accounted for the significance of the genetic takeover from rna to dna in the long-run evolution.

discussion
admittedly, the model used here is complicated , which attempts to simulate the target system with “micro-resolution” at the level of monomers, such as nucleotides, deoxynucleotides, amphiphiles  and their precursors. however, a more abstract model, like the one used in a recent study which addressed the sense of “labor-division” itself to the emergence of dna – wherein dna and rna molecules were treated as impartible “replicators”  <cit> , may be difficult to provide insights as obtained here, especially considering that an nrr would operate at the level of monomers – catalyzing the reduction of nucleotides. the conclusion draw here should be reliable despite the complexity of the present model: note that actually a large part of the model has already been shown to be reliable or reasonable in a series of previous studies ; additionally, besides the cases shown in the presented figures, in fact many additional simulations have been run, e.g., with different random seeds, different “key” steps associated with those “turning-down/up” actions and different parameter values, all of which have demonstrated the robustness of the results shown here. on the other hand, to make our model more friendly, in the simulation interface program , we have provided chance for readers to adjust those parameters that are directly relevant to our study here. the other parameters can also be tested by changing their values in the source code .

in the model, while either dna or rna may serve as a template for the copying of the other type of polymer, no dna/rna chimeric products  may form because it is assumed here that if a foregoing substrate already in place on a template is one type, the subsequent substrates to be incorporated cannot be the other . on one hand, this is due to the consideration to avoid the model to be further complicated – for the purpose here, this simplification is acceptable because what we intend to focus on is whether one genetic material  might supersede another , due to their different properties. on the other hand, there is indeed experimental evidence showing that during the template-depended substrate-addition, the incorporation of a substrate different in type from the foregoing substrate may be much more difficult in reality  <cit> . certainly, we cannot rule out the possibility that the chimeric products might form in the process  <cit>  – and they may even have played a role in the genetic takeover considering that such mosaic nucleic acids might appear in some functional forms  <cit> . perhaps another modeling study that focuses on this issue is interesting, but still needed is much more knowledge concerning the features of the mosaic nucleic acids, such as how to judge their bond-breaking rate in chain degradation, their fidelity in replication and their folding factor which is related to their tendency to act as a template.fig.  <dig> key events associated with the relation, difference and interaction between rna and dna. the diagram shows one grid room in the model which is occupied by a protocell. legends: npp, nucleotide precursor’s precursor; np, nucleotide precursor; nt, nucleotide; ap, amphiphile precursor; am, amphiphile; dnpp, deoxynucleotide precursor’s precursor; dnp, deoxynucleotide precursor; dnt, deoxynucleotide; the notations of ribozymes are the same as in the text. the parameters shown in bold type are those newly introduced which are explained in table  <dig>  and the others are “old ones” whose descriptions can be found in table  <dig>  note that while the rate of chain breaking  for rna is represented by p
bbr, that for dna is defined as p
bbr × f
bbd – wherein, f
bbd < < <dig>  the tendency of a nucleic acid chain turning to template is inversely proportional to the factor for its folding, which is f
sfr for rna and f
sfd for dna – wherein, f
sfr > f
sfd . the fidelity of the template-directed copying is associated with the probability of false base-pairing tolerated at each residue site when the substrates  are attracted onto the template, which are here represented respectively by p
fprr, p
fprd, p
fpdd, and p
fpdr according to the type of the template as well as the type of the substrates. the replication of dna is more accurate than that of rna replication – i.e., p
fpdd < p
fprr. see the text for details



the simulation study here pictures a possible pathway for the genetic takeover, seeded by the emergence of a moderate nrr, getting spread via the environmental change favoring dna, and eventually becoming irreversible accompanying the enlargement of the genome. it may be doubted: is the intermediate stage of the environmental change indeed necessary? the answer is likely to be positive. first, if the environment was in favor of dna  at the very beginning, the rna-based system would have been difficult to arise. for instance, one can enlarge pbbr in the simulation interface program  at the start and see the outcome of the simulation. second, for the genetic takeover from an “established” rna world, the environmental change should be necessary because the enlargement of the genome should have needed a rather long time in evolution, but the effect of the moderate nrr is unstable  and a locally emerged mutant harboring the nrr could even hardly sustain itself given that there would always be competitors  around. the environment change would globalize and stabilize the effect of the nrr, casting a firm dna-genome platform for the long-term evolution . when the genome became quite large, the environment itself would become unimportant and the genetic takeover was no longer reversible .

although a direct experimental demonstration of an nrr remains absent, there has already been much evidence showing the chemical plausibility of such a ribozyme  <cit> , especially considering possible aids from some cofactors  <cit> . the scenario described here may have occurred “quite easily” in the rna world given that only an nrr was needed and only a moderate activity was required for the nrr. higher activity was even dangerous – the system should seek a tradeoff between the syntheses of the “genomic dna” and the “functional rna”. it is actually an important conclusion here that such a systematic balance could be achieved simply by the operation of a single ribozyme with a moderate rate. the kick-off of the genetic takeover by the emergence of such a ribozyme is so simple a way that it ought to have been under the nose of natural selection in the first place. in contrast, an accurate control of dna and rna syntheses  may have required the existence of quite a few ribozymes; however, apparently it would be difficult to evolve this set of ribozymes simultaneously at the very beginning. certainly, dna may have appeared even later – after the invention of proteins  <cit> . it is here not an aim to argue against this idea; however, considering even a primitive translation system may be quite complicated  <cit> , dna, if being able to emerge in such a simple way, seems much more likely to have been invented before proteins. recently, it was seriously considered that due to an alternative, “chemically simpler” way to synthesize deoxynucleotides , dna is also possible to have emerged very early  <cit> . in fact, considering this plausible alternative way, the conclusion of the present modeling study may be stated in a more general tone – that is, in the rna world, an rna-to-dna genetic takeover may simply have been triggered by the emergence of some ribozyme favoring the formation of deoxynucleotides.

as mentioned in the beginning of the paper, significant evolutionary transitions like genetic takeover remains difficult to study experimentally, and they are only “beginning” to appear within the reach of computer simulation researches. thus it is difficult to find targets to compare concerning other explorations on the topic. one relevant case is an in silico simulation study concerning the sense of “labor-division” between template and catalyst to the emergence of dna in the rna world  <cit> , as already mentioned above. in that study, it was concluded that dna being inert in catalytic activity – thus working specially as template, can generate a selective advantage for its emergence in the rna-based system. the study is not directly comparable to the present study on the aspects concerning mechanisms of the emergence of dna because neither they address the advantages of dna as a better template, a more stable polymer and a more faithful information-transmitter, nor we address the issue of labor-division. indeed, the possible advantage of labor-division is not considered here because before the emergence of dna, the labor-division is assumed to have already occurred between the ribozymes and the rna chromosome in our model system  <cit>  – the genetic takeover analyzed here actually takes place from the rna chromosome to the dna chromosome. that is, for the scenario of “dna before proteins”, there is in fact another interesting question: which came first, dna or the chromosome? neither of the two studies per se can answer the question.

the result showing that “a certain genetic material, even after it has established its domination, may be substituted by another type of genetic material” can have a more general sense. the replication and expression of genetic information is central to the life phenomenon, and thus it is in fact reasonable to question the plausibility of such a “revolutionary” takeover. that is to say, the present work at the very least, by demonstrating this plausibility, is significant. as a result, indirectly but almost inevitably, it implies that other kinds of genetic takeover were also possible, e.g., the transition from a pre-rna world to an rna world  <cit> . the plausibility of genetic takeover as demonstrated here supports the idea that life, at its core, is a matter of information rather than that of material. that is why the genetic material alters but the living system goes on. quite interestingly, the pathway of the genetic takeover as pictured here complements that idea with an annotation: in the real world, however, life can only be built upon material, which is constrained by environmental conditions as well as the properties of the material itself. that is why the change of environments might spur the alteration of genetic material, and more significantly, a better genetic material might give rise to a more advanced living system.

CONCLUSIONS
genetic takeover should be plausible. in the rna world, such a takeover may simply have been triggered by the emergence of some ribozyme favoring the formation of deoxynucleotides. the transition may initially have been “weak”, but could have been reinforced by environmental changes unfavorable to rna , and would have ultimately become irreversible accompanying the enlargement of genome during the evolution toward complexity. several distinct virtues of dna  – higher stability against hydrolysis, greater suitability as template and higher fidelity in replication, should have, each in its own way, all been significant for the genetic takeover in evolution. this simulation study, in a broader sense, enhances our understandings of the relationship between information and material in the living world.
