BACKGROUND
according to the world health organization, respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  are one of the leading causes of population morbidity and mortality  <cit> . copd is characterized by irreversible airway obstruction, and one or both of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. clinically, copd is defined by lung function parameters, the forced vital capacity and the forced expiratory volume in the first second  <cit> . since the beginning of genome-wide association studies , efforts were undertaken to further our understanding of the pathobiology of this disease. several studies have identified highly significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms  on chromosome 4q <dig> and lung function as well as risk of copd . however, the mechanistic basis of this signal has not been elucidated. to understand the functional basis for this region, we have previously used expression quantitative trait locus  analyses in multiple non-lung tissues and found the strongest evidence supported the hypothesis that the variable expression of integrator complex subunit  <dig> gene  underlies this association  <cit> .

ints <dig> protein is a member of integrator complex  currently believed to be composed of approximately  <dig> subunits  <cit> . this complex was shown to stably accompany the c-terminal tail of rna polymerase ii  and at a molecular level has been implicated in small nuclear rna  biogenesis  dynein recruitment to the nuclear envelope at the mitotic onset  <cit>  and with polii pause and release  <cit> . at the physiological level, targeted knockdown and mutagenesis experiments demonstrated intscom to be necessary for mouse adipogenesis  <cit> , zebrafish haemopoiesis  <cit>  as well as human primary ciliogenesis  <cit> . the relative contributions of individual subunits in the above processes vary.

direct insights into the function of ints <dig> come from drosophila where it is necessary for the spliceosome’s snrna processing and this function is considered to be canonical . drosophila’s ints <dig> was also implicated in the activation of a key heat shock response gene hsp70aa  <cit> . in hela cells, ints <dig> was specifically shown to be required for the maintenance of perinuclear dynein  <cit>  and formation of primary cilia  <cit> . although ciliogenesis is a dynein-dependent event  <cit>  it is thought that ints <dig> is regulating these two processes separately from each other via the snrna processing pathway  <cit> . ints <dig> is also likely to play important roles in embryonic development. this has been supported by studies which showed that homozygous ints <dig> knockout in m. musculus results in pre-weaning lethality  <cit> . the lethal effect of ints <dig> knockout most probably occurs in utero as breeding heterozygous models only yields wild-type homozygotes or mutant heterozygotes but never produces homozygous litters with no functional copy of the gene . in drosophila, the evolutionary conserved ints12’s plant homeodomain  is dispensable for the canonical snrna processing  <cit>  suggesting the probable existence of other functions for this protein. thus although numerous ints <dig> dependent cellular functions have been reported, no studies have addressed by which molecular mechanisms these functions are implemented.

here we investigate the regulatory properties of ints <dig> in primary human bronchial epithelial cells  to help understand the biological mechanism behind the association signal for lung function at 4q <dig> locus. as no genome-wide molecular assessment of ints <dig> perturbation has been performed to date, we use a hypothesis-free approach  <cit>  by combining gene knockdown with rna sequencing in order to generate new functional hypotheses. we bioinformatically show that ints <dig> has homology to epigenetic regulators of gene expression. as this molecule was shown to interact with genomic dna in flies  <cit> , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing  and combined it with rnaseq data. our data show that ints <dig> acts as a regulator of pathways fundamental for protein synthesis, including the trna synthetases, perk and unfolded protein response pathways. we provide insights into the characteristics of ints <dig> binding as well as its relationship to transcription and propose a model for intscom activity that may explain the plethora of phenotypes observed upon depletion of various members of the complex. finally, we suggest that variation in ints <dig> expression conferred by specific eqtl alleles, dictates the levels of protein synthesis and thus may in part be contributing to the genetic association for lung function.

RESULTS
lung function snps are eqtls for ints <dig> expression in the lung tissue
the association signal for lung function within 4q <dig> contains a peak situated over two oppositely transcribed genes in close proximity to each other, the glutathione s-transferase, c-terminal domain containing  and ints <dig>  based on eqtl analyses in non-lung tissues, it has been suggested that ints <dig> is a more likely contributor to the pulmonary function than gstcd . to confirm this observation, we have taken advantage of a rnaseq-based human lung eqtl dataset from the genotype-tissue expression project  <cit> . there were  <dig> snps at or near 4q <dig> that were significant cis-eqtls for ints <dig> expression  <  <dig> ). among these,  <dig> snps showed significant association for lung function in the spirometa consortium study  <cit> . in contrast, none of these variants showed significant association with gstcd expression . this finding indicates that within 4q <dig> it is the altered expression of ints <dig>  and not gstcd, that is influencing lung function.table  <dig> ints <dig> cis-eqtls at 4q <dig> locus

genome-wide significant snps for lung function parameter forced expiratory volume in the first second  also correlate with ints <dig> expression in the human lung . this observation is not true for the expression of neighbouring gstcd, supporting the hypothesis that altered expression of ints <dig> is driving the association signal for lung function. effect size is defined as the slope of linear regression line relative to reference allele normalized as an expression of  <dig>  the eqtl data was obtained from genotype-tissue expression project, while per snps lung function significance values in linkage disequilibrium with ints <dig>  are from repapi et al. study  <cit> 




human ints <dig> knockdown has modest effects on snrna processing in hbecs
given previous observations in drosophila implying a role for ints <dig> in processing of u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas , we first set out to determine if these observations translate to a human model. because ints <dig> expression is higher in the human bronchial epithelium than other airway structural cells  <cit>  we concentrated our studies on primary hbecs grown to passage three. quantitative pcr  assays measuring misprocessed u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas were developed. we then validated transfection conditions and demonstrated knockdown, both at the mrna  and protein levels , with two different dicer substrate sirnas   <cit>  targeting ints <dig> fig.  <dig> optimizing ints <dig> knockdown and elucidating its effect on snrna processing in hbecs. a optimizing anti-ints <dig> d-sirna transfections. ints <dig> mrna expression in hbecs transfected with three distinct d-sirnas at 10nm  and with the indicated concentrations of d-sirna a and c . d-sirnas a and c at a concentration of 1nm were chosen for subsequent experiments. statistical tests were performed comparing to scrambled d-sirna control: *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> . individual ∆∆ct gene expressions are gapdh normalized and relative to the mean of scrambled d-sirna condition. b representative images of ints <dig> protein expression in anti-ints <dig> d-sirna transfected hbecs by immunofluorescence. c

transfection of primary cultures of hbecs with d-sirnas a and c produced 91 ± 2% and 82 ± 3% knockdown of ints <dig>  respectively . in contrast to findings in drosophila, no significant effects on u <dig> processing were seen. a role for ints <dig> on u <dig> processing was found, with fold increases in u <dig> immature product by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for d-sirnas a and c respectively . however, in keeping with the lack of impact on u <dig> processing, we found no significant effects of ints <dig> knockdown on processing of u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas. these data suggest that whilst ints <dig> may play a role in u <dig> processing, it does not significantly affect processing of u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> snrnas in hbecs. due to ubiquitous expression of snrna genes , we cannot exclude the possibility that effects on other snrna species were not observed due to the requirement for a more robust ints <dig> protein knockdown than was achieved. however, a survey of published studies that investigated the importance of ints <dig>  indicates a potentially weaker role for this molecule in delivering snrna processing relative to other intscom members .

sequence analysis of open reading frames  from  <dig> metazoan species revealed high levels of ints <dig> conservation, particularly its phd . the observed effects on snrna processing together with the detected conservation prompted us to hypothesize the existence of additional functions for ints <dig>  moreover, the evolutionary constrained phd finger is dispensable for snrna processing in drosophila  <cit> . in order to gain insight into the potential ints <dig> functions, a search of similar human proteins was performed using the blastp algorithm  <cit>  . ints12’s phd appeared to be homologous to a large family of fingers whose functions lie in the control of chromatin and nucleosomes  <cit>  where they act as epigenetic regulators of gene expression . therefore, we next aimed to study the genome-wide regulatory properties of ints <dig> by using a combination of gene knockdown with transcriptome profiling and patterns of binding to the genomic dna.fig.  <dig> sequence analysis of ints12’s phd and its sequence similarity to epigenetic regulators of gene expression. a quantitative assessment of ints <dig> conservation using a repertoire of  <dig> metazoan open reading frames. the ratio of non-synonymous changes to synonymous changes  is shown throughout the protein. dn/ds approaching zero indicate strong and significant conservation : red colour p <  <dig> , blue colour p >  <dig> . p-value represents the probability of observed dn/ds ratio given the null the hypothesis of neutral evolution. b full length ints <dig> protein sequence  blastp against a database of homo sapiens protein sequences shows the sequence similarity to be exclusively within the phd. phd appears as a putative zinc and histone h <dig> binding site




differential transcriptome analysis reveals regulation of a core regulome subset of relevance to airway biology
in order to identify a core subset of genes that are significantly regulated by ints <dig> we compared the acute versus longer term transcriptomic responses due to depletion. rnaseq profiling was performed 48 h and 120 h after rna interference . after 48 h the levels of knockdown were 74 ± 1% and 78 ± 2%, whilst after 120 h, 89 ± 1% and 80 ± 2% for d-sirnas a and c respectively . after accounting for off-target and transfection effects there were  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes by ints <dig> knockdown at 48 h and 120 h time points respectively . thus, sustained knockdown resulted in a differential expression of ~ <dig> times more genes than what was observed in acute response to knockdown . for those genes showing altered levels at both time points, called core regulome subset, the magnitude of change was greater at 120 h post initiation of rnai  for all except one . crucially the direction of differential expression for this set of genes is the same in the independent d-sirnas treatments and at both time points .fig.  <dig> differential transcriptome analysis reveals regulation of a core subset of genes relevant to airway biology. statistical tests were performed comparing to scrambled d-sirna control: all significantly deregulated genes had fdr <  <dig> . a venn diagrams of significantly deregulated genes at 48 h in the indicated conditions.  <dig> reproducibly deregulated genes plus  <dig> out of  <dig> genes deregulated in all three comparisons but in opposite direction in ints <dig> knockdown conditions when compared to un-transfected vs. scrambled d-sirna analysis were shortlisted from 48 h dataset . b venn diagrams of significantly deregulated genes at 120 h.  <dig> reproducibly deregulated genes plus  <dig> out of  <dig> genes deregulated in all three comparisons but in opposite direction in ints <dig> knockdown conditions when compared to un-transfected vs. scrambled d-sirna analysis were shortlisted from 120 h dataset . c comparison of 48 h and 120 h transcriptomic responses to ints <dig> knockdown. the two gene sets contain  <dig> common with overrepresentation of genes of relevance to airway biology. d box plot of log <dig> fold changes in gene expression observed in 48 h and 120 h transcriptomic responses to gene knockdown using d-sirna a. sustained depletion resulted in greater fold changes of gene expression. e log <dig> fold changes of  <dig> common genes significantly deregulated at 48 h and 120 h using d-sirna a. genes have greater effect sizes in 120 h response for all except one


the table is showing the fold changes of consensus differentially expressed genes after 48 h and 120 h since the d-sirna a and c transfections




genes showing altered expression include a number of genes known to play important roles in lung disease such as α1-antitrypsin   <cit> , transforming growth factor β  <dig>   <cit> , interleukin  <dig> receptor  <dig>   <cit>  and il <dig>  il <dig>  il1b, il1a . we have calculated the p-value of observing such an association of “lung biology genes” with the list of core regulome assuming the null hypothesis of their independence given the background of protein coding genes. surprisingly in the light of global effects of ints <dig> depletion , this analysis allowed us to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative . il <dig> had the greatest reduction in expression. the gene with the greatest fold induction was leptin  which was shown to be upregulated and secreted from hbecs infected with respiratory syncytial virus  <cit>  . interestingly, several polymorphisms in linkage with lep are associated with lung function  <cit> . lep blood concentration was also shown to negatively correlate with lung function  <cit> . crucially, we have biologically validated lep upregulation in an additional donor hbecs depleted of ints <dig> . these findings suggest that altered expression of ints <dig> in population studies may at least in part contribute to lung biology as well as, more broadly, potentially towards other phenotypes.

in relation to the above findings it is of interest whether ints <dig> can work independently from the rest of the intscom complex or if it mediates tissue-specific functions via this complex. to begin to address this question we have performed a correlation analysis of known intscom members using our entire 48 h and 120 h expression rna-seq datasets. it appeared that average pearson’s correlation coefficients are − <dig>  and  <dig>  at 48 h and 120 h respectively for ints <dig> mrna expression in relation to the other ints proteins . therefore, in hbecs, ints <dig> seems to be expressed independently from the rest of intscom members and potentially operating independently.

differential pathway analysis identifies dysregulation of protein synthesis and collagen formation pathways following ints <dig> knockdown
rnaseq transcriptomic profiling of cells depleted of ints <dig> for 120 hours was used to generate novel functional hypotheses, because of improved silencing and greater number of expression changes observed at this time point . to identify pathways dysregulated as a result of knockdown, gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  was used leveraging  <dig> curated gene sets from the molecular signatures database which included  <dig> canonical pathway definitions . to provide internal replication and account for off-target effects  <cit> , we performed gsea analyses separately following treatment with either d-sirna a or c, comparing scrambled d-sirna treated cells to ints <dig> depleted cells. additionally, un-transfected cells were compared with scrambled d-sirna treated cells to account for pathways that may be altered following treatment with non-specific d-sirna as artefacts of the experimental exposure rather than being causally related to the gene knockdown. pathways reproducibly perturbed by both d-sirnas  but not affected by scrambled d-sirna treatment were shortlisted and finally top dysregulated pathways were identified based on enrichment score ordering.

using this method three pathways were upregulated and eight pathways were downregulated . collagen formation and extracellular matrix organization pathways were the top two upregulated pathways . the top two downregulated pathways were cytosolic trna aminoacylation and perk regulated gene expression  which is a sub-pathway of the unfolded protein response . we also observed significant downregulation of other protein metabolism related pathways, including activation of genes by activating transcription factor  <dig>  and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathways . atf <dig> expression was reduced by 70 ± 5% and 45 ± 2% in d-sirna a and c transfected cells when compared to scrambled d-sirna transfected cells respectively  suggesting an impact on integrated stress response  <cit> . dysregulation of these pathways was not observed when comparing un-transfected cells to scrambled d-sirna cells . overall, we observed greater number of dysregulated gene sets meeting the statistical significance , larger effect sizes , higher number of genes contributing to enrichment score , greater enrichment scores  and lower variance of gene expression  among the downregulated pathways. this suggests that ints <dig> knockdown predominantly results in gene and pathway downregulation. although these experiments cannot specify whether mechanistically these effects are directly or indirectly caused by ints <dig>  it is possible to say that they were initiated by ints <dig> knockdown and thus may be causally attributed to the levels of this gene.fig.  <dig> systematic analysis of dysregulated pathways in ints <dig> depleted cells. a cleveland’s plot showing the gsea results of representative d-sirna a analysis. only pathways reproducibly dysregulated in both d-sirna treatments and not dysregulated by non-specific d-sirna control treatment are included. the shade of colour indicates statistical significance of enrichment after multiple hypotheses testing correction. the size of dot reflects the number of statistically significant differentially expressed gene. the location of dot reflects enrichment score in pathway analysis. b enrichment plots of cytosolic trna aminoacylation and perk regulated gene expression pathways in d-sirna a analysis. the fdr values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  while normalized enrichment scores were − <dig>  and − <dig>  for trna aminoacylation and perk regulated gene expression respectively. c heatmaps of genes belonging to trna aminoacylation and perk regulated gene expression pathways. samples were clustered by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and resulted in clustering of three biological replicate samples of each of the four conditions: un-transfected cells , cells transfected with scrambled d-sirna negative control , cells transfected with anti-ints <dig> d-sirna a  and cells transfected with anti-ints <dig> d-sirna c . green and red colours on the z-scale indicate lower and higher expression respectively




ints <dig> is a regulator of protein synthesis and proliferative capacity
in order to validate the rnaseq data, the expression of methionyl-trna synthetase  and glycyl-trna synthetase  genes from the trna synthetases pathway and atf <dig> and asparagine synthetase  genes from the perk pathway were assessed by qpcr. analysis revealed the correlation of differences in gene expression derived from rnaseq and qpcr estimates to be  <dig>  . the effect of knockdown on genes belonging to these top two downregulated pathways was confirmed by independent experiments in cells from an additional donor. importantly ints <dig> was suppressed by 72 ± 4% and 86 ± 2% in the validation donor for d-sirna a and c respectively versus 93 ± 1% and 85 ± 2% in the discovery donor for d-sirna a and c respectively which was mirrored by magnitude of changes observed among the assayed target genes . these data further support the regulatory effect of ints <dig> upon protein translation pathways.fig.  <dig> technical, biological and phenotypic validation of the ints <dig> knockdown impact on the protein synthesis pathways. a technical validation of rnaseq findings by qpcr. differences in gene expression derived from rnaseq strongly and significantly correlate with differences in gene expression derived from qpcr. validation assays were performed on the same samples that were used for rnaseq study. b biological validation of downregulation of genes belonging to cytosolic trna aminoacylation and perk pathways in hbecs from the discovery donor  and in an additional donor . statistical tests were performed comparing to scrambled d-sirna control: *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , ****p <  <dig> . individual ∆∆ct gene expressions are gapdh normalized and relative to the mean of the scrambled d-sirna condition. c amino acid incorporation measured by counts per methionine  in 120 h since the start of rnai radiolabelling experiment. statistical tests were performed comparing to scrambled d-sirna control: *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> . individual cpm values are normalized to the amount of total protein and are shown as relative to the mean of the un-transfected condition. d hbec counts at the beginning and at the end of 120 h ints <dig> knockdown experiment. statistical tests were performed comparing to scrambled d-sirna control: *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 




because of ints <dig> knockdown induced downregulation of several key pathways involved in protein metabolism and translational control, the question was whether this manipulation would affect cellular translation phenotype. as predicted, ints <dig> silencing repressed protein synthesis by 23 ± 3% and 47 ± 3% in d-sirna a and c respectively . since cell division requires doubling of protein content prior to separation, we also conjectured that ints <dig> depletion would affect the cells’ capacity to proliferate. interestingly, counts revealed 25 ± 13% and 48 ± 4% decrease of total cell numbers in d-sirnas a and c conditions respectively , mirroring the observed reduction in protein synthesis. thus the observed molecular signature impacted the relevant phenotypes, demonstrating ints <dig> as a regulator of genes forming part of translational pathways.

characterization of ints <dig> binding sites and their association with fixed elements
the observed regulation of protein synthesis genes could be either indirect, e.g. through disruption of cell homeostasis, or more direct, e.g. via control of gene transcription or a post-transcriptional mechanism. it is not clear which of these scenarios is the case. therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that its binding might be enriched for promoters of genes differentially expressed following knockdown by performing chipseq  <cit>  using two independent donors’ hbecs and an antibody that we tested to be specific for ints <dig> . we also intended to investigate ints <dig> interaction with both fixed features  <cit>  and cell-type-specific regulatory elements of the human genome  <cit> . out of a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads,  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> % were uniquely mappable, while  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> % were non-redundant in the first, second donor and isotype control respectively.

we first tested inter-donor reproducibility of the chipseq signal. peak calling revealed that there were  <dig> and  <dig> binding sites in the first and second donor respectively . an inter-donor association test of chipseq signal in active regions demonstrated a significant correlation of  <dig>  implying strong biological reproducibility . in order to verify sequencing results, three positive sites and one negative site were selected for further validation by chip-pcr in each chip sample. the number of binding events per thousand cells derived from chip-pcr corresponded well with the observed chipseq signal validating our sequencing results .

the top three fixed genomic features associated with ints <dig> binding were intron, intergenic and promoter  ± 3000 bp) regions. in the first donor they occupied  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, while in the second donor they intersected with  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total binding sites respectively . we noted that  <dig>  and  <dig> % of all promoter binding occurred proximally to tss in the first and second donor respectively. in agreement, a gene-centric analysis over a meta-gene body , revealed ints <dig> binding to be in close proximity to the tss .fig.  <dig> summary of ints <dig> binding to fixed features of the human genome. a percentage of ints <dig> binding sites falling on the fixed annotated genomic features in the first  and second  donor. b gene-centric analysis of ints <dig> binding in the first donor across the gene bodies of all the known human genes shows clear localization near the tss. c relationship of ints <dig> binding to the gene number per each chromosome and chromosome length. analysis of binding versus number of genes revealed pearson’s correlations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the first and second donor respectively. instead, correlations of binding sites and chromosome length are weaker being  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the first and second donor respectively. d comparison of ints <dig> binding in the first donor across the bodies of protein coding, snrna, snorna, lincrna, and microrna genes




next we performed a correlation analysis of ints <dig> binding sites with the number of annotated genes and with the nucleotide length of each chromosome. ints <dig> binding in both donors correlated very well with the number of genes . correlations with chromosome length were notably weaker , indicating that ints <dig> is more likely to regulate gene expression rather than being ‘merely distributed’ across the chromosomes. based on this analysis we conclude that ints <dig> binding sites along the genome are closely correlated with genes.

since the canonical function of ints <dig> is processing of snrnas  <cit>  our initial prediction was that it would be primarily enriched over the bodies of snrna genes and less so for other gene classes. however, our observation of the widespread distribution of ints <dig> binding  prompted us to test for binding enrichment over the bodies of other gene classes. we tested protein coding, snrna, small nucleolar rna , microrna, and long intergenic rna  genes, and found that protein coding and snrna genes show the highest enrichment for ints <dig> binding . for protein-coding genes, peak binding is proximal to the tss while for snrna genes the binding is enriched downstream of the transcriptional end site . of note, the peak binding for lincrna genes is near the tss as for the protein coding genes. the enrichment near tes for snrna genes is in agreement with ints <dig> role as part of snrna processing machinery which occurs simultaneously to the nascent transcription of 3’box elements  <cit> . in summary, the observed different patterns of binding over these protein coding and snrna regions suggest distinct functional activities for ints <dig> depending on the class of the genes it binds to.

association of ints <dig> binding with specific regulatory elements
we next examined the localisation of ints12’s binding in relation to specific regulatory elements identified in hbecs  <cit> . because bioinformatic searches indicated ints12’s phd motif domain to be a candidate nucleosomal histone  <dig> tail binding protein, we tested the intersection of representative ints <dig> binding with reference localizations of histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation , histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation , and histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation  modifications using per-chromosome randomization test  <cit>  . 58% of ints <dig> binding co-localized with h3k4me <dig> , 21% with h3k36me <dig> , and 4% with h3k27me <dig> . interestingly, 96% of ints <dig> binding occurred in the vicinity of hbecs’ dnasei accessible chromatin signature . ints <dig> also overlapped with ctcf insulator protein at 60% of its binding sites .fig.  <dig> summary of ints <dig> binding with hbec epigenetic regulatory elements. a percent of total ints <dig> binding sites overlapping with hbec-specific regulatory elements. data from the first donor is shown as a representative of the two donors tested. colour indicates the z-score of the distance between the observed overlap and the mean of distribution of random overlap permutations. negative z-score implies that the observed overlap is less than expected by chance. higher z-score implies larger distance to the mean of distribution in a randomization test. within p <  <dig>  the maximum z-score in random permutation walk is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  dnasei, and ctcf respectively. the features most prominently localizing with ints <dig> are h3k4me <dig>  and dnasei  both marking transcriptionally active regions as well as ctcf . b cross-correlations of ints <dig> and hbec specific regulatory elements chipseq signals on a genome-wide scale and in the promoter regions . numbers represent pearson’s correlations between chipseq signals of respective reference datasets. c evolutionary conservation of ints <dig> binding sites in vertebrates. the figure is showing the average phastcons score derived from multiple sequence alignment of vertebrate genomes, across the binding sites of ints <dig>  and ctcf protein 




in addition to testing the relationship between cross-binding of ints <dig> and cell type variable mobile element sites we also examined the overall correlation of their respective chipseq signals on a genome-wide scale . in agreement with our initial observations, ints <dig> signal most strongly correlated with accessible chromatin  followed by h3k4me <dig> . h3k36me <dig>  ctcf and h3k27me <dig> had weaker correlations of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively. since gene-centric analysis revealed ints <dig> binding to be enriched near tss we also examined the correlation of chipseq signals at the promoters. in this analysis, the strongest correlation was observed between ints <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  outweighing the correlation between ints <dig> and dnasei . correlations with h3k36me <dig>  ctcf and h3k27me <dig> were weak at the promoters being  <dig> ,  <dig> , and − <dig>  respectively.

overall, based on these data, it is possible to say that ints <dig> binding closely associates with the canonical marks of active transcription i.e. h3k4me <dig> and dnasei. on a genome-wide scale ints <dig> appears to be closely associated with dnasei signature, while at the promoter regions ints <dig> is more highly associated with h3k4me <dig> modification. the identified binding sites are likely to be biologically active as ints <dig> peak regions  show stronger evolutionary conservation when compared with proximal neighbouring regions . ints <dig> regions appeared more evolutionary conserved than ctcf sites, and interestingly, ctcf binding locations are much more narrowly conserved  than what is observed for ints <dig>  these representative observations from the first donor are recapitulated in the second donor and therefore our study provides supporting evidence of recruitment of ints <dig> into transcriptionally active loci which may be modulated via its binding to histone  <dig> and recognition of h3k4me <dig> modification.

combination of chipseq and rnaseq reveals ints <dig> regulome
to provide insights into the dynamics of ints <dig> regulation, we have overlaid chipseq and rnaseq datasets. as ints <dig> showed the highest enrichment with dnasei and h3k4me <dig> sites, both marking active transcription  <cit> , and poor correlation with h3k27me <dig>  which marks silenced loci  <cit> , we examined whether these observations agree with gene expression in basal hbecs. ints <dig> had 8-fold higher enrichment of binding near the tss of expressed genes  in at least one biological replicate). on the other hand, ints <dig> had only  <dig> -fold enrichment of binding over silenced genes  . the magnitude of binding corresponded well with the degree of gene expression .fig.  <dig> combination of chipseq and rnaseq following ints <dig> depletion defines ints <dig> regulome and mode of action. a log <dig> fold change of ints <dig> chipseq binding signal versus input control across gene bodies of expressed and silenced genes in basal hbecs. b comparison of ints <dig> binding vs. corresponding gene expression in basal hbecs. genes were ordered based on the level of ints <dig> chipseq signal. the same sorted gene list was used to evaluate their transcription in basal un-transfected hbecs where red colour indicates higher expression derived from read counts on the corresponding gene bodies. c average ints <dig> binding profile for differentially expressed genes and genes with no evidence of differential expression following ints <dig> depletion  as well as heatmap representation of this binding , with red indicating enrichment while green denoting lack of enrichment in chipseq sample versus input control. d prediction of the activating and repressive function of ints <dig>  the cumulative fraction of genes is plotted against the regulatory potential, based on significance of representative d-sirna a differential expression and chipseq evidence of binding near genes’ tss. regulatory potential is a product of the ranked potentials  as judged by distance and number of ints <dig> binding sites near gene’s tss ) and the potential as judged by significance of gene’s differential expression following ints <dig> depletion . ints <dig> depletion was equally likely to induce or suppress gene expression in kolmogorov-smirnov test but >90% of downregulated genes had a higher regulatory potential than upregulated genes explaining the more robust effects observed on downregulated pathways. e probability distribution of ints <dig> binding enriched dna motif tgaxtca across the sites at which it is present. position at zero represents peak summit and motif appears to be centrally enriched 158 bp in each direction from this summit. the site probability curve is broad  indicating indirect or cooperative binding to the dna




next we aimed to identify the set of genes regulated by ints <dig> . genes were divided into upregulated, downregulated and not differentially expressed following ints <dig> knockdown. on average there was 6-fold, 8-fold and  <dig> -fold enrichment of ints <dig> binding above genome background near the tss of upregulated, downregulated and not differentially expressed genes respectively . thus of the total number of downregulated and upregulated genes  <dig> and 85% of genes show evidence of ints <dig> binding near their promoters, while only 23% of genes that had no evidence of differential expression showed this localization. to provide validation for our findings we calculated the regulatory potential of ints <dig> for each gene based on evidence of near promoter  binding as well as significance of differential expression following d-sirnas depletions, and plotted the ranked list of genes based on their regulation versus cumulative fraction of genes having a given or higher regulatory potential score   <cit> . deregulated genes had significantly greater regulatory potential scores than static genes, with downregulated having lower p-value than upregulated. this shows that the genes with evidence of near promoter binding were contributing to the altered expression following ints <dig> knockdown, with bias for supressed genes. moreover, >90% of downregulated genes had higher regulatory potential than upregulated ones explaining more robust effects observed among the downregulated pathways.

motif enrichment and distribution uncovers ints <dig> mode of action
we next sought to understand if ints <dig> binds to dna directly or in a cooperative fashion. central motif enrichment analysis can identify whether the precipitated protein shows evidence of direct or cooperative dna binding based on the probability distribution of enriched motif among its binding sites. proteins with direct dna binding, such as transcription factors, display binding sites clustering near the centres of the declared chipseq peaks  <cit>  and we leveraged this method to test the most likely type of ints <dig> binding. using a differential analysis approach  <cit> , we identified an enrichment for a motif among  <dig> and 12% of the total sites which occurred only among  <dig> and 5% of background genome sequences in the first and second donor respectively. the same signature was recapitulated by a separate non-differential algorithm  <cit> . the identified sequence was compared to currently known motifs  <cit>  and was found to be identical to a motif previously found enriched among binding sites of activator protein  <dig>  <cit> , activating transcription factor  <dig>  nuclear basic leucine zipper, jun dimerization protein  <dig>  <cit> , nuclear factor erythroid  <dig> as well as fos-related antigen  <dig>  <cit> . although this motif appears to be centrally distributed, the site probability is relatively broad  suggesting that much of the binding via the identified motif occurs in cooperation with other molecules. we conclude that among the sites where the identified enriched motif occurs, ints <dig> does not have the characteristics of a transcription factor and is more likely to act as a co-factor in concert with other molecules.

discussion
our study provides key insights into the molecular and cellular functions as well as the regulatory properties of ints <dig>  a candidate lung function gene. through lung eqtl approach we present evidence that snps associated with pulmonary parameters also correlate with ints <dig> expression, which is not the case for the neighbouring gstcd gene. eqtl analyses have suggested that it is the altered expression of ints <dig> as a more likely driver of the genetic association for lung function, but this has been based on the data obtained from non-lung tissue  <cit> . due to the diversity of tissue gene expression, it is of pivotal importance to use phenotype-relevant datasets  <cit> . a previous investigation of a lung microarray dataset  <cit>  failed to detect a significant eqtl effect on ints <dig>  this may have been due to the technical heterogeneity of hybridization-based array assays  <cit> . using a more sensitive lung rnaseq dataset, in our eqtl analysis we were able to detect the effect of lung function snps on ints <dig> expression. it has become largely accepted that intscom exerts its effects via snrna processing pathway, however we find that in hbecs, among u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> species, only u <dig> 3’-end formation is affected following ints <dig> knockdown.

the contribution of ints <dig> to human snrna processing
ints <dig> is a member of the intscom which itself has been shown to be implicated in numerous molecular and cellular processes. it remains unclear whether all intscom subunits are required for some of these processes, especially that there is variability in the relative contributions of various complex members to snrna processing , maintenance of perinuclear dynein  <cit>  and ciliogenesis  <cit> . what remains to be elucidated is how intscom perturbations yield specific yet diverse phenotypes.

it has been suggested that the primary mechanism behind that is the alteration of snrna 3’-end formation affecting the splicing of mrnas belonging to genes of particular functional groups explaining the specific phenotypic effects  <cit> . for instance, it has been argued that the induced downregulation of ints <dig>  ints <dig>  and ints <dig> in zebrafish causes impaired haematopoiesis due to aberrant splicing of smad <dig> and smad <dig> via a dominant negative form of these transcripts  <cit> . however, given the facts that ints <dig> depletion results in a loss of perinuclear dynein whilst there was no enrichment for misprocessed transcripts encoding dynein-dynactin subunits, adaptor molecules or dynein-binding cassettes in hela cells  <cit>  and our own observation of minor effect of ints <dig> knockdown on snrna processing concurrent with misbalanced protein synthesis, this hypothesis seems unlikely in a human model. this is further supported by a literature review of studies that compared the contribution of various intscom members to snrna processing, showing ints <dig> to have a fairly small role in comparison to other members of the complex . moreover, in the overrepresentation analysis of genes with evidence of d-sirnas-reproducible altered splicing we found a poor enrichment of only immune response pathways  but none of genes with altered splicing were part of any of the identified protein synthesis pathways . therefore, partly based on our observation of poor correlation of ints <dig> levels with the rest of the complex in our datasets, alternatively we propose intscom subunits to have different activities despite their physical association in the same complex and with polii. consequently, the prediction from this model would be that individual intscom members are pleiotropic  <cit>  and have distinct functions which may explain the plethora of phenotypes observed following various perturbations of intscom.

novel functional roles for ints12
we have relied on a hypothesis-free approach  <cit>  in order to generate new functional hypotheses about ints <dig> function. following its knockdown with two d-sirnas, we observed marked downregulation of pathways critical in protein synthesis including trna synthetases, unfolded protein response and perk pathways. to further investigate the importance of this, we undertook additional experiments which showed that suppression of ints <dig> reduces protein synthesis and proliferative capacity. thus the identified molecular signature affected a relevant phenotype, uncovering a new function for this gene by demonstrating its role in regulating cellular translation. we have also detected upregulation of collagen formation and extracellular matrix deposition, but the effects upon the upregulated pathways were less robust.

we then performed ints <dig> chipseq to delve deeper into the mechanism behind the identified gene expression changes. the top three fixed genomic features associated with ints <dig> binding were introns, intergenic regions and promoters. a gene-centric analysis shows a distinct localization near the tss and tes for protein coding and snrna genes respectively. moreover, ints <dig> interaction was enriched for canonical epigenetic marks of transcription. the combined rnaseq and chipseq analyses revealed preferential ints <dig> binding to the expressed rather than silenced genes and defined its regulome which includes genes belonging to the aforementioned pathways.

ints <dig> in evolution and development
it has been hypothesised that the mechanisms involved in the early human lung development may alter lung function and predispose to copd later in life  <cit> . although a subset of lung function associated genes show evidence of differential expression between various stages of embryonic pulmonary tissue formation  <cit> , there is still an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind normal respiratory system development and how the alterations therein contribute to disease pathophysiology. given that there is no homologous ints <dig> in unsegmented c. elegans or unicellular s. cerevisiae, its strong conservation and lethal effect of knockout in m. musculus, this gene may have been important for the evolution of complex metazoan tissue differentiation and specialization. this is also supported by our observation of ints <dig> binding association with canonical epigenetic marks of transcription which are known to be reset during mammalian organogenesis  <cit> . it therefore seems plausible that ints <dig> regulates lung development or repair via a developmental pathway.

ints <dig> knockdown induced gene dysregulation of relevance to pulmonary physiology
ints <dig> knockdown for 48 h and 120 h resulted in reproducible dysregulation of core subset of genes important in airway biology, such as serpina <dig>  tgfβi, il <dig>  and il <dig>  of particular interest is lep which had  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold upregulation relative to control in d-sirna a condition at 48 h and 120 h time points respectively. lep associates with the same lung function parameter as ints <dig>  albeit weaker than what was reported for 4q <dig> locus. crucially lep levels negatively correlate with lung function  <cit> . it is possible that reduced levels of ints <dig> in specific allele carriers are responsible for elevated expression of lep which may in turn account for reduced lung function. these causal hypotheses provide biological understanding of the genetic association signal for pulmonary function but require further exploration.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that ints <dig> is a pleiotropic gene with at least two different functions depending on the class of genes where its binding occurs. in agreement with the canonical function, over snrna genes ints <dig> is likely to contribute to their 3’-end formation. however, in contrast to what was reported in drosophila, ints <dig> requirement for snrna processing is moderate in human cells highlighting differences between these two species. our data identify a significant and previously unrecognized role for ints <dig> in protein synthesis control. a novel ints <dig> regulome was uncovered and implies a regulation of protein coding genes belonging to the translational pathways.
