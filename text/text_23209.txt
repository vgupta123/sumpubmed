BACKGROUND
the development of high-throughput measurement technologies and associated computational analysis tools allow tumors to be identified based on a profile of mrna expression levels  <cit> . currently, most dna chips contain more than  <dig>  <dig> probe sets. these expression profiles obtained from biopsies or fine needle aspirations can then be correlated with traditional tumor characteristics  and behaviour . in breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is treatment provided prior to surgery, allows breast tumor chemosensitivity to be tested in vivo  <cit> . a pathologic complete response  at surgery correlates with an excellent outcome, whereas residual disease  is associated with a poor outcome. investigators have reported the use of gene profiling of tumors and multigene predictors  to predict response to treatment. accurate prediction of tumor sensitivity to preoperative chemotherapy is important because nopcr patients could be spared ineffective treatment and instead be administered alternative treatments. therefore, such predictors allow for the delivery of individualized treatments  <cit> .

the design of such a multigene predictor of patient class  involves the use of a learning data set, in which the cases have been divided into two groups according to the known outcome of the treatment, and of an independent validation set.

three main challenges arise when designing such predictors  <cit> :

• selecting subsets of dna probe sets relevant to the pathology and to the preoperative chemotherapy

• combining the mrna expression levels of these subsets of dna probe sets in order to get a reliable prediction of the efficacy of the preoperative chemotherapy

• ensuring that the performance of the predictor is independent of the learning data set 

the most commonly used methods for selecting a subset of dna probe sets identify probes that deviate most from a random distribution of expression levels or that are the most differentially expressed between the pcr and nopcr learning cases. in the former approach, statistical analysis is used to rank genes based on the calculated p-values of the probe sets, and this ranking provides the basis for gene selection  <cit> .

in this study, we hypothesized that multigenic predictor performance could be improved if it were based on probe sets whose individual predictions were close to those of a hypothetical ideal probe set. first we considered single probe sets and their individual predictions of treatment outcomes. then we used a valuation function to assign high values to probe sets that correctly predicted many cases in the learning set, and that predicted relative proportions of pcr and nopcr cases close to those of the whole learning set.

we compared the performance of multigenic predictors using the  <dig> probe sets showing the highest p-values in t tests and the highest results for the valuation function.

RESULTS
top-ranked probe sets
we calculated the valuation of the  <dig>  <dig> probe sets contained in the microarrays and ranked the probe sets according to their v values. table  <dig> gives, for each of the  <dig> top ranked probe sets, the corresponding gene, the probe set valuation, the number p of correctly predicted pcr learning cases, the number n of correctly predicted nopcr learning cases, and the total number c = p + n of correctly predicted learning cases.

for instance, each of the two probe sets of gene btg <dig> correctly predicted the outcome of  <dig> of  <dig> pcr learning cases and  <dig> of  <dig> nopcr cases.

since the valuation function based on the mean and standard deviation of gene expression level, we used a t test to determine the p values of gene expressions for pcr and nopcr for the  <dig> top-ranked probe sets. the p values ranged from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig> .

the ranks of these p-values for the  <dig> probe sets with the highest valuation functions among the  <dig>  <dig> probe sets ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the  <dig> probe sets with the highest p-values shared eight probe sets in common .

we then studied whether there was a correlation between the level of expression of the probe sets and their valuation. as shown in figure 1a, we did not find any correlation , suggesting that the valuation function does not depend on the level of expression of the probe set.

we also studied the correlation of valuation function in  <dig> replicates. in figure 1b, we report the correlation of the valuation function for the  <dig> top-ranked probe set. we did not re-rank all the probe sets because the number of pcr cases  was relatively low in this particular subset. the correlation between original samples and replicates was high: r =  <dig> . when p-values obtained by t-test were compared between replicates, the correlation was r =  <dig> . this demonstrates that our method is reproducible.

bi-informative and mono-informative probe sets
the definition of the pcr and nopcr predictions of a probe set leads to three different kinds of probe sets:

• the bi-informative probe sets: each of them predicts at least one pcr learning case and one nopcr learning case, i.e. p> <dig> and n>0;

• the mono-informative probe sets: each of them is informative of a single class of patient cases:

◦ pcr-probe sets: p> <dig> and n =  <dig> 

◦ nopcr-probe sets: n> <dig> and p = 0;

• the non-informative probe sets: p = n =  <dig> 

figures in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> illustrate a bi-informative probe set, a pcr probe set, and a nopcr probe set. in the upper part of figure  <dig>  the expression levels of a bi-informative probe set, probe s = 213134_x_at of gene btg <dig>  is shown for the  <dig> cases of the learning set.

the expression levels of the  <dig> pcr patient cases are plotted with the character "+" and those of the  <dig> nopcr patient cases with the character "-". the interval of pcr expression levels ip is represented by three lines of height mp, mp-sdp and mp+sdp drawn based on the expression levels of the pcr learning cases.

the interval of nopcr expression levels in is represented by lines of heights mn, mn-sdn and mn+sdn drawn based on the expression levels of the nopcr learning cases.

the lower part of figure  <dig> shows the pcr and nopcr predictions of the probe set. one can see that the probe set of gene btg <dig> predicted the treatment's outcome of  <dig> pcr learning cases and  <dig> nopcr learning cases.

using the same representation system, additional file  <dig> reports the pcr probe set s = 213033_s_at of gene nfib, and additional file  <dig> reports the nopcr probe set s = 203928_x_at of gene mapt. the former predicted the treatment's outcome of  <dig> pcr learning cases; the latter predicted the outcome of  <dig> nopcr learning cases.

for the learning data set, the proportion of the  <dig>  <dig> probe sets belonging to each of the three types of probe sets were as follows:

• mono-informative probe sets: 71% ;

• bi-informative probe sets: 25%;

• non-informative probe sets: 4%.

in spite of the high proportion of mono-informative probe sets, none of them was found among the set of  <dig> top-ranked probe sets. in fact, the first mono-informative probe set was ranked at position 63: nopcr probe set s = 207067_s_at of gene hdc.

this is the direct result of the valuation function v for the probe set. it is not an arbitrarily imposed requirement of our analysis.

we have investigated the informativity of the probe sets with the highest p-values by t-test and it appeared that this property is a characteristic of our method. in the study of hess et al.  <cit> , which provided the data for the present work, the probe sets were ranked according to the p-value calculated from a t test. of the  <dig> highest-ranking probes in that study,  <dig> are nopcr-probe sets .

ratio of pcr to nopcr correct predictions
the ratio of the pcr to nopcr cases  in the learning set was

 p/n = 21/ <dig> =  <dig>  

this ratio is in excellent agreement with the ratios of the total number of pcr and nopcr correct predictions using the k top-ranked probe sets; the ratios for k =  <dig> to  <dig> lay between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . this result confirmed that the predictions of the high-ranking probe sets were close to those of the ideal probe set not only in the number of learning cases they correctly predicted, but also in the ratio of pcr to nopcr cases among these predicted cases.

these results also seemed to be a particular feature of our method of probe selection: in the study reported by hess et al.  <cit> , the ratio of pcr to nopcr predictions of the  <dig> probe sets with the highest p-values was 123/ <dig> =  <dig> . this ratio was three times lower than the ratio of pcr to nopcr cases in the learning set. these ratios were, in turn, very close to that of correct pcr to nopcr predictions for all probe sets:  <dig> 925/ <dig>  <dig> =  <dig> .

multigenic predictors
internal validation of k probe set predictors
we first evaluated the performance of multigenic predictors in a leave-one-out cross validation and in a k-fold cross-validation . for the leave-one-out cross-validation, we repeated the probe selection for each procedure. for the k-fold cross-validation, we used the  <dig> highest-ranking probes in order to investigate whether the importance of probe selection is important for every method used to construct the multigenic predictor. we investigated dlda, and nearest centroids. the p-values of methods in cross-validation procedures were based on  <dig> random permutations.

the results indicated in table  <dig> showed that dlda had similar performance with t-test probe sets and bi-informative probe sets . bi-informative probes improved the nearest centroid method.

external validation: independent datasets
the first set of validation cases  contained data of  <dig> patients, and the response to treatment was pcr for  <dig> patient cases and nopcr for  <dig> patients. hence, the ratios of pcr to nopcr patient cases were the same for the learning and the validation datasets. figure  <dig> depicts the values of sensitivity and specificity of the first  <dig> k probe set majority vote predictors . the  <dig> and  <dig> probe set predictors achieved the performances of the  <dig> probe set predictor. table  <dig> shows the numbers of false positives and false negatives for the k probe sets predictors  for the external validation data. the  <dig> probe set predictor misclassified a total of seven patient cases: one was a false negative and six were false positives <dig>  this result confirms that in this population, a 30-probe set predictor provides the most accurate results  <cit> .

in the present article, we have decided to use a very simple classification criterion for defining the k probes predictors, namely, unweighted majority voting among the predictions of the probes. many other classifiers could be developed for the selected probes, and countless studies have been devoted to this issue. hess et al.  <cit>  studied several of them using a varying numbers of probes and a total of  <dig> classifiers . these classifiers were composed of probes selected according to their p-value calculated from a t-test. the researchers showed that among these predictors, the one showing the best performance for these particular data was the diagonal linear discriminant analysis with  <dig> probe sets .

we have evaluated the dlda classifier composed of the  <dig> probes with the highest valuation functions, and compared it to a dlda classifier composed of the  <dig> probe sets showing the highest p-values. the discriminations of the two classifiers are represented in figure 5: auc obtained with the bi-informative probes and the t-test probes were  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and  <dig>  +/-  <dig> , respectively. the performance metrics analysis  showed that the dlda classifier built from the bi-informative probes had a better accuracy  than the t-test dlda-classifier . interestingly, misclassified cases were similar between the two probe sets. the dlda predictor built from the bi-informative probes correctly classified two additional patients compared to the dlda predictor built with the t-test probes. the dlda classifier built with the bi-informative probes had a better sensitivity  than the t-test dlda-classifier .

the second set of validation consisted of  <dig> patients treated with the same chemotherapy regimen as the learning set, but very few of these patients had a tumor with her <dig> amplification. the discriminations of the two classifiers are represented in figure 7: auc obtained with the bi-informative probes and the t-test probes were  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and  <dig>  +/-  <dig> , respectively. the performance metrics analysis  showed that the dlda classifier built with the bi-informative probes was slightly more sensitive  than the t-test dlda-classifier . this suggests that the "positive" informativity of bi-informative probes may translate into greater sensitivity.

the third validation set consisted of  <dig> patients treated with anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. discriminations were poorer compared to previous validation sets : auc obtained with the bi-informative probes and the t-test probes were  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and  <dig>  +/-  <dig> , respectively. the performance metrics analysis showed that the dlda classifier built with the bi-informative probes were more accurate  than the t-test dlda-classifier . the sensitivity was the same for both probe set selection methods . this combination of low accuracy and high sensitivity suggests that multigenic predictors are at least partly specific of a chemotherapy regimen, and that they are sensitive to the ratio of pcr and nopcr.

p-value of the majority vote predictors
the p-values of the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe set predictors were less than  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  based on the null hypothesis of a predictor composed of random probe sets. individual probe set predictions were chosen at random among the three possible values, pcr, nopcr, and unspecified, with probabilities coming from the validation set data. the details of the computation of the upper bound of the p-values are in the appendix "p-value of the predictors" .

weighting the predictions of probes
we defined a family of valuation functions, vα, parameterized by the real number alpha, α ∈  <cit> :

 vα =α×p)+×n) 

the valuation function v previously defined is the particular case vα= <dig> . high parameter values favor probes with high numbers of pcr predictions p and vice-versa. the valuation of a probe depends on the parameter α, so its rank depends on this parameter as well as on the set of k top-ranked probes, hence the k probe predictors. for each value α ∈ { <dig>   <dig> ,..., <dig> }, additional file  <dig> gives the set of  <dig> top-ranked probes and the performances of the predictor composed of the  <dig> top-ranked probes based on the valuation function vα. additional file  <dig> gives the ratios of pcr to nopcr predictions for this weighted valuation functions. additional file  <dig> provides sets top  <dig> probes for the weighted valuation functions. figure  <dig> depicts how the sensitivity and specificity of the  <dig> first k probe predictors varied with the values of the weighting parameter α ∈ { <dig>   <dig> ,..., <dig> }. the parameter value α =  <dig> grants all the weight to the pcr predictions p of the probes. for α =  <dig>  all k probe predictors with k ≥  <dig> classified any patient case as pcr . in contrast, the parameter value α =  <dig> grants all the weight to the nopcr predictions n. the specificity of the resulting predictors was  <dig>  and their sensitivity was very low . for this set of  <dig> parameter values, the parameter value α =  <dig> , which is given by the initial valuation function v, provides the best  <dig> probe predictor. only one other value of α , yielded a  <dig> probe predictor with the same accuracy value of  <dig> , but it had a lower sensitivity.

the explanation of these results lies in the ratio r of pcr to nopcr numbers of predictions for the top  <dig> probes in the ranking of the function vα. the values of these ratios r should be compared to the ratio r = p/n =  <dig>  of the numbers of pcr to nopcr learning cases. additional file  <dig> gives these ratios r for α ∈ { <dig>   <dig> ,..., <dig> }. the set sα of the top  <dig> probes for the weighting parameter α =  <dig>  had a ratio r = p/n =  <dig> , where p and n are the total numbers of pcr and nopcr predictions of the set of probes sα. this value was the closest to the ratio r =  <dig> . the ratio r increases with the parameter α, from r =  <dig>  to r =  <dig> , which are far lower and far higher, respectively, than the ratio r =  <dig> . these values explain the performances of the respective predictors. the conclusion is that the valuation function v = v <dig>  gives the best predictor. nevertheless, the weighting can be used to favor specificity or sensitivity of the predictors.

discussion
we have introduced a new procedure to select probes that can be used as multigenic predictors. this procedure selects probes that convey information on both positive and negative issues. using cross-validation, we have confirmed that predictors built with bi-informative probes provide similar results as predictors built with probes selected using a t test. predictors with bi-informative probes perform better on independent datasets.

one crucial problem in predicting cancer prognosis based on microarray data is that of building prediction models based on ~ <dig> genes that are stable in both the learning set and the actual sample set. the most common approach is to consider each probe set individually and see whether it distinguishes samples with different class labels by using student's t test . this is a simple method for testing whether two variables have identical gaussian distributions. generally, a significance level is chosen for determining the genes that will be included in the predictors; genes that are differentially expressed between the classes at less than the specified threshold are included in the predictor. therefore, all genes are ranked according to the result and the top k genes are selected as the feature subset to be used. in our study, for example, we selected the  <dig> top-ranked genes because hess et al determined that  <dig> probe sets were optimal  <cit> .

michiels et al.  <cit>  have analyzed seven published microarray cancer data sets, and highlighted the difficulties inherent to this approach. examining different prostate cancer data sets, wang et al.  <cit>  found that misclassification rates strongly depended on which samples were used for training and which probes were selected for predictor construction. there is therefore a need to find robust gene selection methods for multigenic predictors.

there are several methods to select probes that could be of interest for a multigenic predictor: these methods may be based either on biological aspects, computational aspects or, as in the present study, on the samples themselves.

paik et al.  <cit> , for example, have selected probes for genes previously demonstrated to be important in breast cancer in order to predict survival and response to adjuvant chemotherapy. we tried to use these genes, but obtained unsatisfactory results . indeed, most of these genes proved monoinformative and captured a very singular aspect of breast tumors. because probe sets may be redundant, some authors have reported a way to remove redundancy in the selected gene set that is compatible with any method  <cit> . these biological aspects, while interesting when considering targeted therapy such as estrogen receptor expression for hormone therapy or her <dig> amplification for trastuzumab, do not provide more information than classic biomarkers in the case of non-targeted therapy such as chemotherapy.

other groups have reduced the dimensionality by singular value decomposition , also referred to as principal component analysis , using, for example, the first ten principal components or metagenes to build predictors  <cit> . bo and jonassen have developed the "greedy-pairs method" for selecting genes  <cit> . in this approach, all genes are ranked based on their individual t-scores on the training set. the procedure selects the highest-ranked gene gi and finds the one other gene gj that, together with gi, provides the best discrimination. this is measured using the distance between centroids of the two classes with regard to the two genes when projected on the diagonal linear discriminant axis. these two selected genes are then removed from the gene set and the procedure is repeated on the remaining set until a specified number of genes has been selected. this method attempts to select pairs of genes that work well together to discriminate the classes. it is computationally efficient, but it rarely reveals biological characteristics.

in order to maximize the information provided by the training set, some methods are based on results provided by internal cross-validation. wang et al. have reported a greedy robust feature selection approach built on the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to retain the most frequently identified genes for building a predictive model  <cit> . leaving out one sample at a time, they used a greedy-lda to identify a set of predictive genes. they counted the number of times a gene was selected, and retained only the most frequently identified genes as the selected features. similarly, michiels et al. proposed performing repeated random sampling to improve the stability of predictors  <cit> . jiang et al. proposed a gene shaving method based on random forests and another method based on fisher's linear discrimination, leading the researchers to discover marker genes with expression patterns that could differentiate lung cancer cells from normal cells  <cit> . fisher's linear discrimination is a traditional classification method that is computationally efficient, while random forests is based on growing an ensemble of trees  on bootstrapped samples, which significantly improves the classification accuracy.

our approach is somehow different because it favors probes that convey information on samples with positive and negative outcomes. all probes are differentially expressed in both subsets of patients; in fact, our method assumes that samples of different classes have gaussian distributions, as demonstrated by p values calculated by t test. the probes are subjected to a more stringent criterion because the intersection of confidence intervals tends to be low for selected probes. moreover, the ratio between negative and positive issues accounts for another criterion. each probe could theoretically be used as a unigenic predictor. the α parameter that we introduce to account for positive and negative outcomes can be adjusted to favor sensitivity or specificity of the multigenic predictor. in the case of a predictor based on a majority vote, the α parameter should be  <dig>  to maintain equity.

ideally, these probe selection methods could be combined to identify most relevant probes because these methods each take advantage of particular strengths in probe selection  <cit> . additional studies should be carried out on multiple datasets to investigate complementary methods. the discrepancies between microarray data publicly available from pharmacogenomic programs  precluded any possibility of additional validation. in further studies, we plan to test other prediction problems such as molecular classification or survival issue.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we propose a valuation function that assigns the highest values to probes that correctly predict cases across the whole learning set, such that each probe not only successfully predict a large number of cases, but also predicts pcr and nopcr cases in approximately the same ratio as was seen in the whole set. in addition to improving the prediction of patient response to breast cancer preoperative chemotherapy, our approach has made it possible to classify probes as bi-informative and mono-informative.
