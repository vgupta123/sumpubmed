BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis , is responsible for around two million deaths and nine million new cases annually. south africa  is one of the worst affected tb countries  <cit>  and was an epicentre for an hiv-associated, extensively drug-resistant tb  outbreak in  <dig> within the kwazulu natal  province  <cit> . three m.tuberculosis strains were subsequently isolated from sputum of hiv co-infected patients from kzn. these strains represent three levels of varying drug resistance phenotypes namely; susceptible, multiple drug resistant  and xdr tb  <cit> .

generally, tb strains are classified as mdr if they are resistant to first-line drugs isonaizid  and rifampicin , and as xdr if they are additionally resistant to one of the second-line injec drugs capreomycin, kanamycin or amikacin and at least one fluoroquinolone drug  <cit> . increasing resistance to anti-tb drugs means that the need for novel drugs is growing in urgency.

current anti-tb drugs target information-processing dna and rna polymerase or dna gyrase  <cit> . drugs could, however, alternatively target metabolic pathways unique to this pathogen by comparing host and pathogen metabolism  <cit> . the tropical disease research  target database and assessdrugtarget can help in prioritizing putative drug targets by assigning a set of weighted criteria  <cit> , though most of these targets do not map to metabolic pathways and are not involved in dormancy. in this study, we specifically identify drug resistance pathways to allow known drug resistant mutations in one target to be offset by inhibiting another enzyme of the same metabolic pathway. putative targets were filtered to exclude non-viable candidates based on essentiality for survival, lack of homology to human host, known biological function and conserved between mycobacterial species . one of the proposed targets, rv <dig> was analyzed by caceres et al.  <cit> . however, the authors did not deposit their homology models. furthermore, their md simulations were insufficient at 3 ns. the published homology modeling data for rv <dig> in the absence of any experimental data was insufficient as a starting point for identifying potential inhibitors. in this study, rv <dig> was screened for potential inhibitors using a strategy that included molecular modeling, molecular dynamics and in silico docking of potential inhibitors.fig.  <dig> a workflow illustrating the different steps taken to identify potential drug targets for m. tuberculosis, homology modeling, molecular dynamics, docking strategy and interaction analysis for one target rv1712



RESULTS
genome comparisons and pathway analysis
genomic data from different tb strains previously confirmed ten point mutations in eight genes involved in first and second-line drug resistance and computationally identified  <dig> novel mutations in  <dig> genes in mdr and xdr kzn strains . further literature searches identified ten genes linked to resistance to first and second-line anti-tb drugs  <cit> . in this study, we exclusively focussed on the  <dig> experimentally verified drug resistance genes. using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit> , twelve of the resulting  <dig> gene products linked to drug-resistance were mapped to  <dig> metabolic pathways, while six could not be assigned to a kegg pathway . three of the pathways, pyrimidine , oxidative phosphorylation , and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism  were selected for their functional importance to bacterial growth and the latent state  as well as their promise as targets in slow growing bacteria .

selection and prioritization of candidate genes
of  <dig> gene products in the three selected pathways,  <dig> are known tb drug targets and were excluded from further analyses  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> genes were checked to avoid duplication of research efforts with the tb structural genome consortium   <cit>  leaving  <dig> putative targets. additionally, no crystal structure was available for the tbsgc-target rv <dig> and was therefore included in our analysis . of these  <dig> targets,  <dig> are essential for m. tuberculosis survival based on a rv number query search within the tuberculist web server, have known biological function and have no experimental 3d structure .

of these, nine are not homologous to any human proteins . they share >67 % sequence identity identity and >82 % sequence coverage with orthologs from other mycobacterial species . publicly available microarray data indicates that four of the nine genes, rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv1622c and rv2421c, are up-regulated during dormancy  while five, rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv1456c, rv <dig> and rv <dig>  are weakly down-regulated . other analyses used to validate the selected targets included blastp searches against three species of human gut flora bacteria  and mouse proteins , revealing no homology to any mouse proteins . however, six proteins showed varying degrees of sequence identity and coverage to some intestinal bacteria. of the nine proteins, rv <dig>  rv <dig> and rv2421c share ~40 % sequence identity and 90 % sequence coverage to orthologs in all three intestinal bacteria, while rv <dig> and rv1622c share 30–40 % sequence identity to orthologs in two bacteria, and rv <dig> is 55 % identical to an ortholog in host gut bacteria with 87 % sequence coverage . the three remaining proteins, rv <dig>  rv <dig> and rv1456c are without homologs in the three human gut bacteria . kegg pathway maps for the nine gene products were generated using the m. tuberculosis h37rv strain database . interestingly, rv1622c and rv1456c are at the interface of two metabolic pathways .

template selection and model building
a search of the protein data bank  revealed 1q3t, 2h <dig>  1cke and 1kdo as homologs for rv <dig>  an alignment of the five proteins indicated sequence identities of 43 % , 40 % , 39 %  and 40 %  making them useful modeling templates. incorporating structural data reveals a p-loop  in the n-terminal atp-binding domain and residues in a nucleoside monophosphate  binding site to be highly conserved. the conserved active site residues shared by rv <dig> and its four templates potentially allows these residues to be used in identifying novel inhibitors for enzymes of rv <dig> in docking studies.

fifty structural models were constructed for rv <dig> and the model with the lowest discrete optimised protein energy  score was selected for further analysis. the fold assessment score ga <dig> for the lowest dope model was equal to  <dig>  suggesting that the correct fold was assigned to the protein rv <dig>  the rv <dig> structural model contains nine α-helices and eight β-strands and encompasses a core , an nmp-binding  and a lid  domain . the nmp-binding domain is free to rotate during substrate binding and presumably recognizes both cmp or dcmp.fig.  <dig> ribbon diagram of the structural model of m. tuberculosis cytidilate monokinase . the core domain, nmp-binding domain and the lid domain are labelled as well as ligands cmp and so <dig> shown as sticks. figure generated using pymol  <cit> 



model quality validation
the dope score profile of the rv <dig> model is similar to that of templates 1q3t, 1cke, 1kdo and 2h <dig> . without high energy regions, the model would appear to be native like. the normalised dope z-score was − <dig>  indicating high model reliability. the model also conforms to permitted stereochemical restraints with  <dig>  % of residues in most favoured and none in disallowed regions of the ramachandran plot  <cit> . the quality factor calculated using the protein structure verification algorithm implemented in errat  <cit>  indicates that 85 % of residues in the 3d model have a low error rate compared to crystal structures of the same size and length. a prosa z-score for the rv <dig> model of − <dig>  is comparable to those of the templates . the root mean square deviation  values obtained after aligning all atoms suggest that the rv <dig> model is most similar to 2h <dig>  and 2o8r  than to 1q3t  and 1cke . this indicates very little deviation from the main chain carbon atoms between target and template suggesting homology and similarity between the structures. the inclusion of the recently solved crystal structure of cytidylate kinase from m. smegmatis did not significantly alter the rv <dig> model . the rv <dig> model thus suitably approximates the actual protein structure .

molecular dynamics
trajectory analysis of the rv <dig> model in complex with ligand cytidine-5′-monophosphate  results in a rapid increase in rmsd during the first 2500 ps followed by a gradual decrease after 5000 ps for both the protein backbone atoms and ligand c5p carbon atoms . the ligand rmsd was measured by performing a least squared fit to the starting conformation while allowing translation and rotation of all bonds within the ligand. an equilibrium phase was reached within 5000 ps suggesting that 30 ns was sufficient for stabilizing the structure. the average total energy and the potential energy reaches convergence at − <dig>  ×  <dig> and − <dig>  ×  <dig> kj/mole, respectively . the rms fluctuation for the c-alpha residues ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm and the radius of gyration for the molecule stabilized after 5000 ps fluctuating between  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm . the simulation was repeated at random seed allowing all atoms to reach 300 k temperature and no significant drift was observed between the two trajectories.

virtual compound screening and interaction analysis
the lowest energy conformation obtained for docking c5p to the equilibrated structure was − <dig>  kcal/mol . screening  <dig> compounds from the zinc database against the equilibrated structure yielded ten compounds with higher binding affinity values than − <dig>  kcal/mol . interaction analysis using poseview shows that the natural substrate c5p forms one hydrogen bond with glutamine <dig> and a п-stacking interaction with tyrosine <dig>  salt bridge interaction analysis confirmed one positively charged residue arginine <dig> of rv <dig> with negatively charged c5p phosphate group. compounds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively form  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hydrogen bonds to rv <dig> . binana interaction analysis indicates a salt bridge between each compound and positively charged residues of rv <dig> such as lysine <dig>  arginine <dig>  aspartate <dig> and arginine <dig> . all compounds similarly retain a п-stacking interaction with tyrosine <dig> of rv <dig> .fig.  <dig>

discussion
this study focuses on metabolic pathways previously targeted by anti-tb drugs to increase the likelihood of selecting effective targets. target validation included five filtering steps and two quality tests. previous studies used assessdrugtarget and the tdr target database to identify potential drug targets in pathogenic bacteria. this led to the transcription factor devr and the enzymes glne and fbpd to be proposed as potential drug targets  <cit>  based on their high ranking on the metabolic list despite neither being part of a metabolic pathway. the target protein fbpd was, moreover, listed among other essential enzymes in the m. tuberculosis species-specific list although not being an essential enzyme. similarly, the biological role of the enzymes glne and fbpd remain unknown, limiting their use for biochemical and biophysical assays  <cit> . our approach improves on these methods by selecting essential enzymes which have been functionally characterised thereby increasing the likelihood of selecting effective putative target candidates.

predicted sub-cellular localization of putative targets
of the identified putative targets, six  are cytoplasmically membrane-associated proteins whereas three, rv <dig>  rv <dig> and rv2421c, are bone fide soluble, cytoplasmic proteins  <cit> . membrane proteins are preferred drug targets as they are accessible from their extracellular surface without the drug having to be taken up or modified  <cit> . unfortunately, membrane proteins are far more difficult to analyse structurally than soluble proteins hindering the assessment of their druggability  <cit> . drug delivery strategies to intracellular targets have improved over the years and include the use of cell penetrating peptides, ph responsive carriers and endosome-disrupting agents  <cit> .

cytidylate kinase and polyphosphate kinase as drug targets
of the nine putative targets obtained using our approach, six  were previously identified as potential drug targets  <cit> , underlining the robustness of our method. of these, only rv <dig>  cytidylate kinase, and rv <dig>  polyphosphate kinase, have been investigated both experimentally and computationally  <cit> . two studies of polyphosphate kinase experimentally support polyphosphate kinase as a promising drug target  <cit>  while a study of cytidylate kinase did not publically deposit the predicted model structure and no inhibitors were been identified  <cit> . supported by our findings, cytidylate and polyphosphate kinase would thus appear to be relevant m. tuberculosis drug targets. the three remaining proteins from our study, rv <dig>  rv1456c and rv2421c have, to our knowledge, not previously been proposed as drug targets.

pathway and drug target validation
the nine genes reported in this study form part of three metabolic pathways: pyrimidine, oxidative phosphorylation, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. of these, rv1622c and rv1456c constitute a two component system unique to bacteria, fungi and plants. drugs inhibiting these targets would therefore be specific to bacteria with minimal human toxicity. the target rv <dig> is central to the phosphorylation of atp to nucleoside diphosphates in the pyrimidine pathway  <cit> . the known tb drug target rv <dig> forms part of the purine and pyrimidine pathway and mutations in its gene rpob lead to rif resistance. with rv <dig> sharing this pathway it could be an attractive alternative target to inhibit the pathway.

five candidates, rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig> and rv <dig>  map to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. the target rv1854c  in this pathway is the target for inh and several mutations in this gene account for inh resistant cases  <cit> . inhibiting any of the five proposed targets could disrupt the pathway and eliminate m. tuberculosis by reducing its limited atp availability during dormancy  <cit> .

rv2421c transfers phosphorous groups in nicotinate/nicotinamide salvage and de novo synthesis. rv2043c of this pathway is the target of the highly effective drug pza that kills persistent bacilli in the initial phase of tb therapy  <cit> . mutations in the encoding gene pnca confer resistance to pza  <cit> . successful inhibition of rv2421c could thus help to eradicate slowly growing persistent bacilli in tb infection.

although the three selected pathways are also found in humans, the proposed targets are unique to bacteria and unrelated to human proteins meaning that possible drugs are unlikely to affect human metabolism. the similar absence of murine homologs could further allow for mouse infection studies. the nine targets are conserved in several mycobacteria pathogenic to humans such as m. leprae, abscessus, and ulcerans, implying that broad spectrum inhibitors are possible. as the targets are also conserved in h. pylori, n. meningitidis and e. coli, new tb drugs could be used to target these pathogens. the conservation of the targets underscores their essentiality and could imply some innate resistance to mutation. the proteins rv <dig>  rv <dig> and rv1456c lack close homologs in several human gut bacteria meaning that their inhibition by drugs is unlikely to disrupt the host microbiome. although rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv1622c and rv2421c share remote homologs in several gut bacteria, their investigation is warranted as the target for the tb drug rifampicin, dna-directed rna polymerase, is highly conserved across all species. a mere five exchanged residues between eukaryotic and bacterial rna polymerase gives rise to the selectivity of rif  <cit> . while rv <dig> satisfied all our prioritization criteria, its conservation in humans demote it in our list of putative targets. subtle differences between bacterial and human versions could nevertheless reinstate it rv <dig> as a potential target. finally, rv <dig> was further analysed because our results and experimental findings indicate it to be essential for m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

molecular dynamics
the simulated molecular dynamics of rv <dig> in complex with c5p indicated 30 ns to be sufficient for reaching a stability plateau. this is in contrast to the  <cit>  study which found 3 ns to be sufficient for equilibrating the structure. however, the rmsf fluctuation of all c-alpha residues for our model was similar to that of the  <cit>  study suggesting that the presence of ligand c5p introduces major stability of the lid domain  of the protein preventing atp hydrolysis. additionally, the radius of gyration for the molecule became constant after 5000 ps suggesting that the rv1712-c5p complex has a stable surface structure suitable for virtual screening and drug design.

virtual screening and interaction analysis
computational methods have proven useful in the past to identify novel drugs to treat resistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . using similar approaches we have successfully identified ten compounds with higher binding affinity values compared to c5p docked to the equilibrated model of rv <dig>  analysis of these ten compounds showed a larger number of interactions namely hydrogen bonds and salt bridges compared to ligand c5p suggesting a stronger affinity for rv <dig>  further analysis revealed interaction of compounds with highly conserved key residues  important for catalytic activity of rv <dig> as identified in a study by  <cit>  using the homologous template 2h <dig>  interestingly our compounds also interact with lys <dig> which is part of the p-loop forming the large anion hole which usually binds the sulphate ion thereby preventing nucleophillic attack by the phosphate of atp. this implies a role for these compounds as competitive inhibitors of rv <dig>  although ligand c5p makes only one hydrogen bond with residue gln <dig> in our predicted model compared to the  <cit>  study which makes ten hydrogen bonds, this is only due to a lower hydrogen bond cut-off value . nine compounds share the overall orientation of c5p and its binding site. the evidence provided advocates the need for additional in silico studies to validate these compounds as inhibitors of rv <dig>  we propose that the compounds should be tested experimentally to establish their non-toxicity to human cell lines and their inhibition of m. tuberculosis growth.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, known drug resistance genes were mapped to three kegg metabolic pathways. all proteins from these three metabolic pathways were subjected to a filtering criteria such as essentiality, known function, absence of human homologs and conservation within mycobacteria. this resulted in the identification of nine putative drug target candidates of which three are novel  the integrated approach successfully implemented in this study can be extended to other pathogenic organisms for which drug resistance data is available. furthermore, ten compounds with higher affinity than substrate c5p was identified using molecular docking and these compounds warrants further investigation to assess their potential to inhibit m. tuberculosis growth.
