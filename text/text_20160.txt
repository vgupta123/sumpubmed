BACKGROUND
the holstein-friesian breed is the world's highest-producing dairy cattle; much of its outstanding milk production was gained by selection of elite artificial insemination  bulls based on breeding values that were estimated by progeny testing. genomic selection is a newly developed tool for the estimation of breeding values through the use of genome-wide genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms . over  <dig>  holstein bulls have been genotyped with the illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> , which includes  <dig>  snps . this chip may capture any genetic variance that is genetically linked to these markers, as well as copy number variations   <cit> . a cnv is a structural variation, including deletion, duplication, translocation or inversion. cnv has been recently identified in human and other mammalian genomes, and it is now recognized that cnv might be a major source of heritable variation in complex traits  <cit> . in humans, over  <dig>  cnv loci have been recorded based on  <dig>  different entries that cover about one-third of the genome. of these entries, 65% include cnvs that range mostly between  <dig> and  <dig> kb and 34% are indels in the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/. cnv regions  encompassing adjacent or overlapping losses or gains cover 12% of the human genome. hence, this source of variation has more nucleotide content per genome than snps  <cit> . however, assuming an average spontaneous cnv mutation rate of 1/ <dig>  per locus  <cit> , it is expected that a considerable portion of the reported entries arise from de novo cnvs of a sporadic nature.

several algorithms for cnv identification from snp arrays are available  <cit> . following reports that penncnv was the most reliable algorithm in the detection of cnvs from illumina beadchip data  <cit> , we chose this software to analyze signal intensity  data. penncnv is a cnv detection tool that incorporates multiple sources of information, including the ratio of total si to allelic intensity at each snp marker. this software was originally developed for illumina whole-genome beadchip arrays  <cit> .

the introduction of ai to modern dairy herd management has resulted in a loss of genetic diversity in holsteins and the effective size of the holstein population is low . since the israeli holstein population has been under intensive selection for  <dig> years, its genetic pool is expected to have similar characteristics. although it is now accepted that genomes vary more at the structural level than at the nucleotide-sequence level, little has been published on cnvs in holsteins.

in a study that validated the quality of bovinesnp <dig> beadchip performance  <cit> , population-wide genotyping of israeli holstein bulls was initiated in order to introduce genomic selection into the israeli breeding program. our study makes use of these data to describe the frequent cnv in holsteins and investigate its effect on beadchip calls. we propose to combine hardy-weinberg equilibrium -based and si-based methods to reliably detect cnvs of the deletion and duplication types that are not de novo or sporadic cnvs, which are less likely to be of any economic value.

RESULTS
hwe-based detection of cnv
we used the data obtained for  <dig> holstein bulls to investigate the effects of cnvs on bovinesnp <dig> beadchip calls. for each of the snps, we estimated the frequency of occurrence of deletions and insertions using a generalization of the hardy-weinberg principle for more than two allele frequencies  by assuming presence of a third allele . under the assumption of three-alleles, expected hwe frequencies are obtained by the trinomial expansion of  <dig> =  <dig>  defining 'n' as the number of individuals sampled, 'pqo' as the detected number of individuals with phenotype similar to the pq heterozygote phenotype divided by n, 'po' as the number of allele p-like homozygotes divided by n, and 'qo' as the number of allele q-like homozygotes divided by n, the solution for this expansion in the case of a null allele r is: rl =  <dig>  -  <dig> ; in the case of gain of an allele which consists of both types, r is: rg =  <dig>  - po <dig>  - qo <dig>  . average values of rl and rg for autosomal markers were - <dig> % ±  <dig>  and  <dig> % ±  <dig> , respectively. for non-pseudoautosomal markers on the x chromosome , where the model of inheritance does not fit the model under which the formulas were developed, average values of rl and rg were 361% ±  <dig> and -25% ±  <dig>  respectively. thus, encountering extreme values  for rl, when analyzing autosomal markers, may indicate an error in the mapping of markers that are actually located on sex chromosomes. although the hwe deviation is an important factor in cnv occurrence, other reasons than erroneous positioning of markers of sex chromosomes may also exist; for example, systematic problems in distinguishing the alleles, due to technical failures. however these are unlikely, because of the high quality of the beadchip technology  <cit> .

si-based detection of cnv
using the penncnv detection module, we analyzed the autosomes of each of the  <dig> bulls for cnvs. from the output of this analysis, which contained the chromosomal positions and copy numbers of the detected cnvs, the frequency of loss or gain for each snp marker was calculated . average loss and gain values for autosomal markers were lsi =  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and gsi =  <dig> % ±  <dig> , respectively.

comparing the hwe-based and si-based methods for cnv detection
seeking confirmation of the cnv detection, we examined the correlation between the hwe-based and si-based detection methods . when sorted according to frequency of deletion as detected by the penncnv analysis , the markers that exhibited frequent loh using the hwe-based formulas  clustered together towards the right end of panel a . the distribution of frequencies of the si-based method was of limited range  compared to the hwe-based method . six autosomal markers displayed rl values higher than 100%, five of them that were closely mapped on bta <dig> . these markers were regarded as non-autosomal and removed from further analyses.

as the holstein population has a very low effective population size, it was expected that some of the cnv alleles within our sample would be common. however, all of the cnvs detected by penncnv were relatively rare ,) and we suspected that this may arise from setting up input parameters that are too stringent. therefore, we examined several setups for running this program using different hmm input files and different length restrictions on the cnv chromosomal size . we then calculated the correlations for each setup, with no limit on cnv size. we adopted the setup that gave the highest correlations between the si-based and hwe-based methods with the expected direction signs . since "negative loss" is equal to gain, it was generally expected that negative correlations would be displayed when comparing the loss and gain methods. si gain and loss involves a simple count of events, and therefore could only yield positive correlations when cnv exhibited both loh and duplication alleles. a negative correlation  was indeed observed between the hwe-based gain and loss methods, indicating that the equations presented for calculation of loss and gain frequencies also function well for loci that do not fit the model for which they were developed. for example, in a locus where loh was frequent, the absolute value of rg would be similar to rl but with a negative sign. correlations between the loh/cnv frequencies predicted by the hwe-based and si-based methods was low . nevertheless, a number of loci displayed above-average cnv frequencies by both hwe-based and si-based methods simultaneously. the discrepancy between the methods may be explained by random deviations from hwe ; by de novo cnvs that do not affect hwe; and by the conservative thresholds on the detection of cnvs by penncnv, which presents moderate power with a low false-positive rate  <cit> .

combining the results of hwe-based and si-based methods
a total of  <dig> markers displaying frequencies that were more than one standard deviation  above average for loh  were included in the data set for regions of loh variation. a total of  <dig> markers displaying frequencies that were more than one sd above average for duplication  were included in the data set for copy gains. since these markers tended to cluster together, and cnvs may affect expression of genes that are up to  <dig>  kb away  <cit> , such adjacent markers were assigned to the same cnvr . these two data sets were combined and compared to the available cnv annotations in cattle . the actual length of the predicted cnvs cannot be accurately assigned using the beadchip data, and cnv of a region that is evident from a single marker may belong to a region shorter than  <dig> bp, which is usually referred to as an indel. in total, we detected  <dig> indels/cnvs/cnvrs of copy losses  and  <dig> of copy gains. these were compared to  <dig> documented cattle cnvs with recorded frequency above  <dig> %  <cit> , and with  <dig> frequent cnvrs  <cit> . the latter study analyzed only  <dig> individuals, with an average frequency of detection of  <dig> ± 2: we assumed that cnvrs detected in three or more individuals are likely to be frequent. defining confirmation as co-occurrence of a documented cnv within  <dig>  kb of a cnv detected here,  <dig>  of the cnvs reported in  <cit>  and  <cit> , and  <dig>  of those reported in  <cit>  were confirmed by the present study. another line of evidence supporting our list of loh variations was that most  of these markers had significantly high rates of missing calls. the average for "no calls" was  <dig> ±  <dig> out of  <dig> bulls genotyped for the autosomal markers, while for the  <dig> selected loh markers, the average was  <dig>  an increase in no-call rate is expected with an increase in the frequency of null alleles, as individuals that are homozygous for the null allele should fall within the no-call category and the expected number of individuals with no call should be ≥nrl <dig> . the higher than expected frequency of snps with deviation from the expected hwe frequencies calculated using the χ <dig> test was also an indication of cnvs. there were  <dig>  autosomal polymorphic snps, of which  <dig>   had probabilities < <dig>  for hwe. despite selection against non-hwe snps during the beadchip preparation  <cit> , their fraction is nearly double that expected by chance. while overall,  <dig> % of the autosomal polymorphic beadchip markers had probabilities < <dig> , frequencies for markers meeting this criterion in the lists of loh  and cnv gain  were 83% and 51%, respectively.

along the autosomes, we encountered the highest values for rl on bta <dig>  we therefore compared the frequencies of cnv occurrence estimated by the hwe-based and si-based methods and the previously described segmental duplications and common  cnvs . previous data were based mostly on the sequence data of bovine genome assemblies , array comparative genomic hybridization   <cit>  and the bovinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> . low correlations were observed between the cnv-detection methods, except for the chromosome interval that included positions  containing genes similar to melanoma antigen . virtually no heterozygotes were detected for the five polymorphic snp markers within this interval. the hwe- calculated loh frequencies for these exceeded 100%, values which are typical for non-autosomal chromosomes. indeed the human mageb orthologs are mapped to chromosome x, suggesting that in current bovine genome assemblies, the x chromosomal region containing copy variation of this gene is misplaced and that the repetitive character of this locus may have complicated its chromosomal assignment.

marker effects indicated the importance of bta <dig> for economic merit according to the usda index  <cit> . the most pronounced effect was associated with a qtl related to calf size or birth weight in position  <dig> , <dig> . to exemplify the possible association of economic traits with cnvs, we also present detailed results for bta <dig> . while the major peak  coincided with a region rich in segmental duplications within a cnv gain , the second effect peak  was mapped to a region where loh was detected in this study by both methods, with maximal value at position  <dig> ,794: at this position, there was a hwe-calculated loss of 43% and a si-calculated loss of 1% . hence, the proximity of these largest effects to cnvs suggests association of these copy gain and loss regions with traits of economic merit.

analysis of gene content within frequently detected cnvs
in our study, some of the detected cnvs may have arisen from spontaneous cnv mutations. high rate of de novo mutations for several human diseases caused by cnv has been observed  <cit> . de novo mutations may also explain the low rate of verification  of candidate cnvs detected by snp arrays reported in human studies  <cit> . to reliably detect cnvs that are expected to have a functional impact and are not de novo or sporadic, we targeted those that are frequently detected by both hwe-based and si-based methods. nevertheless, the sporadic occurrence of cnvs in the genomes of ancestral key bulls in regions that are neutral for selection are expected to result in some frequent cnvs that have no function. indeed, we could not associate any functional gene with  <dig>  of the common cnvs that we reported. these are indicated in the corresponding gene column as 'none' or pseudogene .

other cnvs demonstrated an enrichment of functions which was associated with overrepresentation of specific gene families . gene content of cnvrs  demonstrated an overrepresentation of genes/pseudogenes for olfactory receptors , cadherins  and transporters . enrichment for ors and abc transporters in cnvrs has been previously described for cattle cnvs  <cit> . variation in abc transporters may affect milk content  <cit> . the tendency of cadherins to accumulate cnvs may relate to their highly repetitive structure containing cadherin, laminin a and g, egf and mucin repeats  <cit> , which may be a source of genomic instability.

ncbi list of  <dig>  homo sapiens genes were compared to the list of  <dig> genes orthologous to the cnv gene content  using panther.  <dig> , <dig> denote categories that are associated with overrepresentation of gene families for cadherins, olfactory receptors and transporters, respectively. the full version of this table is provided in additional file  <dig> 

analyzing gene clusters of ors as a measure of the effectiveness of common cnv discovery
the significantly pronounced  enrichment for olfaction was due to the frequent occurrence of cnvs in gene clusters for ors  <cit> . organization of or gene clusters is well conserved among mammals and despite the difference in the number of genes,  <dig> large genomic clusters  are present in humans and mice  <cit> . thus, the rate of assignment of cnvs into these clusters may indicate the effectiveness of cnv detection in general. common or cnvs that were detected in this study, as well as those that have been previously observed in cattle, were labelled on the map of ors in the bovine genome, which contained  <dig> distinct autosomal locations . assuming that the  <dig> large autosomal or clusters are common cnvrs in all breeds, the efficiency of detection of this study was 29% while previous studies annotated 18%, 3% and 26% as frequent cnvrs . however, when considering cnvs of smaller size, microarray analysis at a resolution of ≤ <dig>  probes may detect fewer than 10% of all cnvs  <cit> , and it is likely that when designing the illumina beadchip, probes in cnvrs that were not in hwe were selected against  <cit> . therefore, the  <dig> cnvs in holsteins reported here may be part of a 10-fold larger repertoire of inherited common cnvs, which have yet to be described. moreover, our hwe-based method is only suitable for polymorphic sites, and not for copy gain variation in which the duplicated copy does not differ from the source copy. another limitation of our hwe approach is that only two simplified models of one copy loss or gain were considered, while much more complex scenarios involving both loss and gain of multiple copies have been frequently observed  <cit> . despite these rather serious limitations, the number of frequent cnvs detected in this study exceeds previous reports for the following possible reasons: 1) our bull sample was larger and belonged to a homogenous population; 2) the noisy nature of the data obtained from previous si-based hybridization experiments called for a conservative interpretation; 3) the equations based on hwe for calculation of cnv frequency may yield true results in cnv loci that do not exactly fit the model . recent studies in humans indicated that copy number analysis using next-generation sequencing is more accurate than array-based platforms, in determination of absolute copy number and break-point structure  <cit> . with sequencing technology allowing more sequence reads at lower costs, it is likely to become the method of choice for cnv analysis, which would enable the uncovering of the full extent of inherited structural variation in cattle.

validation of copy number variation and of cnv association with breeding values using qpcr
further validation of the effectiveness of our approach of combining hwe-based and si-based methods for cnv detection was obtained by real-time qpcr analysis of the region where loh was detected by this study with maximal value at position  <dig> , <dig> on bta <dig>  relative copy numbers per haploid genome  were estimated for  <dig> sires randomly selected from the sample analysed in beadchip experiment. two amplicons, about  <dig> kbp apart, within the relevant cnvr # <dig>  were analysed. results of the validation of cnv at amplicon i and of its association with breeding values for the israeli index of total merit are presented in figure  <dig>  in addition to the significant association between the loss of this region and total merit , significant associations with copy number were also found with the genetic evaluations for protein production , fat production  and herd life . these observations are in accordance with the qtl of net merit observed for us holsteins at this chromosomal position .

the cnrqs of two sires  suggested that they were homozygous for the deletion. in the sample of  <dig> sires an estimate of frequency of the deletion allele can be derived as 12%, based on the occurrence of two homozygotes and assuming a hardy-weinberg distribution of genotypes. since the number of homozygotes will have a poisson distribution, the 95% confidence interval will not be symmetric, and extends from  <dig>  to  <dig>  homozygotes, which is equivalent to a confidence interval of  <dig> % to  <dig> % for the deletion allele. thus, for this cnvr, the average loh frequencies of the hwe-based and si-based methods , was within the confidence interval.

significant positive correlation  was observed between cnrqs of the two amplicons in  <dig> sires that passed quality thresholds for both amplicons. this indicates that a portion of the sires analysed displayed cnv that spanned both amplicons, yet some of them may had other cnv alleles with borders that excluded one of the amplicons. hence, the qpcr analysis of both amplicon supported the prediction of cnvr # <dig> in this work.

CONCLUSIONS
expansion of hwe and penncnv analyses enabled an estimation of loh/cnv frequencies, and combining these methods yielded better detection of inherited cnvs. correlation between loh/cnv frequencies predicted by the hwe-based and si-based methods was low . the highest correlation was observed for the minimal cnv length of  <dig> snp for the penncnv analysis. under these conditions,  <dig> locations displayed significantly high frequency by both methods. efficiency of designating large genomic clusters of ors as cnvs was 29%. frequency values for copy loss were distinguishable in non-autosomal regions and for the values obtained for bta <dig> positions  <dig> ,037- <dig> , <dig>  suggesting misplacement of the x chromosomal region containing cnv of the melanoma antigen gene onto bta <dig> in the current bovine genome assemblies. analysis of bta <dig> placed important net merit qtls in regions rich in segmental duplications and cnvs. enrichment of transporters in cnv loci suggested their potential effect on milk-production traits. although our approach for identifying common cnvs was more effective than previous methodologies applied in cattle, it has severe limitations. thus the number of cnvs reported here for the holstein breed may be part of a 10-fold larger repertoire of inherited structural variation that has yet to be described.
