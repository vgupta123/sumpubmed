BACKGROUND
crustaceans make up around 10% of the world’s aquaculture production with average growth in production of 15% per year from  <dig> reaching  <dig> million tonnes in  <dig>  <cit> . rapid growth during the period 2001– <dig> was due to increased production of litopenaeus vannamei in china, thailand, and indonesia. production of p. chinensis has been reduced, and no significant change in the production of p. monodon has occurred over the last 13 years, mainly because of difficulties due to disease with white spot syndrome virus in these species and the increased availability of genetically improved specific pathogen free l. vannamei post-larvae. more than 80% of shrimp exports from india are derived from aquaculture production.

one of the major worldwide problems limiting the culture of shrimp is viral disease. white spot syndrome virus  is a lethal pathogen that can cause up to 100% mortality within 7– <dig> days on shrimp farms, and has devastated shrimp farming industries across the world . selective breeding has been suggested by many as a highly effective long term strategy to combat the threat of disease  <cit> . however, resistance to wssv has low heritability in l. vannamei
, and limited evidence has been found for genetic variation in resistance to wssv in p. monodon
 <cit> , especially because of the difficulty with developing a standardized challenge protocol for wssv. shrimp exposed to wssv have a rapid mortality rate and cannibalism can cause secondary waves of infection. oral infection of individual shrimp with a controlled dose of the virus, although technically difficult and labour intensive, is recommended  <cit> . where genetic resistance has been detected, it has been found to be strongly negatively correlated with growth rate  <cit> .

shrimp have a very limited adaptive immune response  <cit>  and lack diverse immune related molecules such as immunoglobulin, t cell receptor and major histocompatibility complex. the innate immune response of shrimp has been shown to be triggered almost instantaneously in response to peptidoglycan stimulation  <cit>  and is believed to be the primary defence mechanism against infection in this group of species. a number of potential antimicrobial peptide coding genes have been isolated from penaeid shrimp and some such as penaeidins and crustins have been found to be differentially expressed over the time course of infection . the susceptibility of p. monodon to white spot disease has been shown to increase when penaeidin class  <dig> expression is suppressed by interference mediated gene silencing  <cit> . shrimp surviving 84 hours post-infection have higher expression of lysozyme, c-type lectin, penaeidins, prophenoloxidase- <dig> and prophenoloxidase- <dig> in haemocytes than those dying less than 60 hours post infection  <cit> . heat shock protein  <dig> is down regulated after infection to wssv  <cit> . shrimp lysozyme has been shown to be effective in blocking infection by wssv in blue shrimp   <cit> .

as yet there are no vaccines or other treatments available with proven efficacy against wssv, although a number of studies have revealed promising leads. the wssv binding proteins isolated from viral particles in the haemolymph of shrimp infected with wssv, have been shown to inhibit the binding of this virus to haemolymph cells and improve survival of shrimp  <cit> . injection of shrimp with recombinant fortilin after infection with wssv, results in 80-100% survival and low levels of wssv are detected, suggesting that fortilin inhibits viral replication  <cit> . fortilin is highly upregulated in haemolymph during the early phase of white spot infection  <cit> . injection with recombinant ferritin or lysozyme also results in protection to challenge with wssv  <cit> . inoculation in feed with bacterially expressed double stranded rna vp <dig>  and vaccination with vp <dig> and recombinant vp <dig> , as well as exposure to probiotics and beta- <dig> / <dig> -glucans  <cit> , have been shown to provide improved survivability. shrimp immunity to wssv was shown to be enhanced by intramuscular injection of oligodeoxynucleotides with cytosine-guanine motifs and vibrio harveyi dna  <cit> . in addition, double stranded rna of any type has been found to induce antiviral protection in shrimp  <cit> . interestingly, a gene designated as pmav was isolated using differential display from viral resistant shrimp and was shown to have antiviral activity  <cit> .

resistance to wssv is a strong candidate trait for marker-assisted or genomic selection since it appears to have low heritability and has a negative correlation with another selected trait . the lack of reported quantitative trait loci associated with this trait may not be due to the lack of segregating genes for resistance, but could instead be due to the highly virulent nature of wssv, challenge testing methods that do not deliver accurate resistant phenotypes and because marker resources do not sufficiently cover the genome.

another important factor in shrimp cultivation is sex determination. female penaeid shrimps grow more rapidly than males and so mono-sex production of females would be advantageous for production  <cit> . this could also be used to provide a level of genetic protection, hindering the replication of genetically superior stock. in penaeid shrimps, females are known to be heterogametic with sex determined by a wz-zz chromosomal system . however, more detailed mapping studies are needed to find closely linked markers and genes associated with sex determination. if homogametic females can be easily identified there is potential to use them as parents to yield completely sexually uniform heterogametic female offspring  <cit> . although some markers associated with sex determination have been identified  <cit> , little is known about candidate genes, mechanism or map regions associated with the sex of crustaceans.

here we undertake the first comprehensive genome scan for qtl associated with resistance to wssv and for the sex-determining locus in p. monodon. a new wssv challenge testing protocol that aims to deliver more accurate disease resistant phenotypes is devised and utilised. a set of  <dig> linkage mapped transcribed gene snps are used to genotype  <dig> sexed individuals derived from  <dig> full-sibling families challenged-tested for wssv.

qtl for wssv resistance – gwas and interval mapping analysis
the quality control steps excluded all markers with non-mendelian inheritance and all individuals unassigned with parentage analysis, leaving  <dig> markers and  <dig> individuals for analysis. for the fasta and grammas gwas analysis the additional quality control steps excluded  <dig> markers and  <dig> individuals with a call rate of less than 95%,  <dig> individuals with high autosomal heterozygosity  and  <dig> individuals with identity by descent ≥ <dig> . no markers or individuals with a call rate less than  <dig>  and minor allele frequency < <dig> % were detected. after the quality control,  <dig> markers and  <dig> individuals were selected for the fasta and grammas analysis.

ten significant qtl for wssv resistance  were detected on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . eight snps  showed significant genome wide associations, and three regions  showed significant linkage with hours of survival. these snps occurred in transcripts for genes encoding runt protein 1a, flagellar hook-length control protein, ubiquitin domain-containing protein ubfd <dig>  paired-like homeodomain transcription factor  <dig>  ankyrinn repeat and many unannotated genes. box plots of hours of survival post-wssv infection for individuals with alternative genotypes for two informative snps in the vicinity of the qtl detected on linkage group  <dig>  and for gwas significant snps on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> , show patterns indicating additive gene effects for these qtl.table  <dig>

some of the snps associated with qtl were found to map within or close to genes with putative immune functions of interest . for example, the snp marking a qtl at position  <dig>  cm on linkage group  <dig> , occurred in a transcript that shared high homology to a gene encoding runt protein 1a in the signal crayfish pacifastacus leniusculus. snp 24034_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg  <dig> in a transcript with homology to the proteasome  26 s gene maps in the middle of a broad 41 cm region containing several snps in transcripts showing suggestive and significant associations with hours of survival after wssv infection . variation at snp 45605_ <dig> in a transcript with homology to a gene encoding ubiquitin domain-containing protein ubfd <dig> on lg  <dig> was associated with hours of survival . the snp 40050_ <dig> occurs in a transcript with homology to a gene encoding 26 s proteasome subunit s <dig> and maps  <dig>  cm from snp 33044_ <dig>  and  <dig>  cm from a predicted qtl . the snp 49912_ <dig> which occurs in a transcript with homology to the mitogen activated protein kinase gene, mapped  <dig>  cm from the qtl position detected by gridqtl analysis on lg <dig> . the snp 52376_ <dig> occurs in a transcript that is homologous to the hect e <dig> ubiquitin gene and maps  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm from snps 51029_ <dig>  and 50096_ <dig>  at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively along lg <dig>  snps 48349_ <dig>  which occurs in a transcript with homology to proteasome  26 s non-  <dig> gene, and 38683_ <dig>  which occurs in a transcript with homology to a gene encoding ubiquitin conjugating enzyme  <dig> interacting protein, map  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively from snp 50096_ <dig>  at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  three genes encoding proteins with putative immune function map near to snp 18472_ <dig>  at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  snp 52279_ <dig> which also maps to  <dig>  cm on lg  <dig> and which occurs in a transcript with homology to the serine-threonine protein kinase gene, snp 42578_ <dig> which occurs in a transcript with homology to a gene encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase-binding protein  <dig> which is  <dig>  cm distant and snp 50961_ <dig> which occurs in a transcript showing homology to a gene encoding igf <dig> mrna binding protein and is  <dig>  cm distant.table  <dig>

the pattern of segregation of this locus to male and female offspring fits what would be expected for a locus associated with sex determination, assuming that female p. monodon are the heterogametic sex . eighty-seven percent of males  were homozygous aa for snp 49245_ <dig> across the families  whereas ninety percent of females  were heterozygous ag. of the males that were not aa, 13% were ag, and less than 1% were gg genotypes. the gg males were only detected in one family . most other families contained a low proportion of ag males, except two families  where all males were aa genotypes. of the females that were not ag, 5% were aa and 5% were gg. the gg females were only detected in one particular full-sibling family . all families contained low numbers of aa females, except family  <dig> in which 56/ <dig> females were ag. also mapping to this region  is snp 43522_ <dig> which occurs in a transcript with homology to the feminisation- <dig> gene  in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans .

discussion
invertebrates rely on innate immune systems to recognise and respond to foreign agents. resistance to disease is a complex quantitative trait that is likely to be regulated by the additive effects of many genes, epigenetics and by the environment. in contrast, sex, which is measured as a binomial qualitative trait, is likely to be determined by the action of a few genes mapping to a specific area of one linkage group. variation affecting disease resistance or sex could act by changing the regulation of gene expression or by leading to modifications of the protein product and consequent function. the snps developed for this study were detected among shrimp sourced from the east coast of india and andaman islands  <cit> . in developing snps we included rna from three individuals that had survived a severe wssv outbreak on a farm in bapatla. these surviving shrimp represented only  <dig> % of the total post-larvae that were stocked for culture. they were later transferred to secure tank facilities where they lived for more than four months. these shrimp were found to be positive for wssv using a nested pcr test. these survivors were included in the present study to improve the chance of detecting snp variants that are associated with resistance to wssv. all the snps used in the study occur in transcribed genes .

the challenge test experiment used in this study which lodged shrimp in individual baskets was designed so that all shrimp could be collected and sampled within 1 hour of death and to prevent secondary infection . although the time from infection with wssv to death is rapid, a controlled route of infection and dosage was chosen to prolong the overall time frame of the experiment as much as possible and to give a spread of hours of survival. large full-sibling families  and frequent observation were also employed to give a strong power for detecting qtl.

both the linkage and gwas analyses detected significant qtl associated with hours of survival after wssv infection. for three of the four qtl detected by linkage analysis, closely mapping snps with suggestive associations were detected by gwas analysis . fewer qtl were detected using linkage analysis than using gwas. while linkage analysis relies on the segregation of alleles within families, gwas correlates the occurrence of snp alleles with phenotypes across the population. comparison of linkage analysis and gwas has shown that gwas, where all snps are fitted simultaneously as random effects, has greater power to discriminate linked qtl  <cit> , especially those of limited or modest sized effects  <cit> . the sensitivity of linkage analysis is affected by the number of parents that are segregating for the qtl and neighbouring snp loci and by the extent of linkage among snps mapping in the vicinity of the qtl. the sensitivity of gwas depends on the existence of linkage disequilibrium between the qtl and single snp loci  and on the existence of snps sharing a similar allele conformation to that of the qtl. it has been found by other studies that the two types of analyses generally yield inconsistent results, but can agree if the differences between the two methods , are accounted for  <cit> .

for the gwas analyses, the grammas and fasta results were often in agreement, while the results of qfam analysis were less often in agreement with grammas or fasta. for instance, snp 18472_ <dig> on lg <dig> was found to be associated with hours survival by the qfam test , but was found to be suggestively associated with the trait by the grammas and fasta tests. similarly, snp 51997_ <dig> on lg <dig> was associated with hours survival for the qfam test  and a closely mapping snp was suggestively associated using the fasta test. no agreement for the significant association detected by qfam at position  <dig>  cm was found by grammas or fasta tests across lg <dig>  whereas, significant associations detected on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by grammas or fasta were supported by corresponding suggestive or significant associations by fasta or grammas respectively for the same snp. fasta and grammas, which use genomic control to infer genetic relations from genomic data, and thereby account for the true genealogy , are thought to be superior to methods such as qfam, which makes use of the observed genealogy   <cit> .

candidate genes mapping to qtl regions
several of the snps directly associated, or closely linked to wssv resistance qtl, were found to occur in transcripts that share homology to genes with putative immune functions. some of the genes, such as heat shock protein  <dig>  c-type lectin and serine-threonine specific protein kinase, have been implicated in affecting the wssv resistance of crustaceans in other studies . some are components of gene pathways, such as the ubiquitination pathway, which have been found to affect the pathogenesis of wssv  <cit> .

the ubiquitin proteasome pathway
the ubiquitin proteasome pathway has been shown to play an important role in immune defence and more specifically proteasome i is presumed to be involved in intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis of antibody-bound viruses  <cit> . six snps in transcripts with homology to proteasome encoding genes of interest were either directly or closely mapped to qtl for wssv resistance , including snp 24034_ <dig> in a transcript with homology to the proteasome  gene which was  <dig>  cm from snp 51997_ <dig> , snp 23272_ <dig> in a transcript with homology to the 26 s protease regulatory subunit gene , snp 40050_ <dig> in a transcript with homology to the 26 s proteasome subunit s <dig> gene which maps  <dig>  cm from a qtl position predicted by linkage analysis , snp 17687_ <dig> in a transcript with homology to the proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig> gene which was  <dig>  cm from snp 32667_ <dig> , snp 48349_ <dig> in a transcript with homology to the proteasome  26 s non- <dig> gene which maps  <dig>  cm from snp 50096_ <dig>  and snp 49666_ <dig> in a transcript with homology to the 26 s proteasome non-atpase regulatory subunit 11-like gene which maps to the same position as snp 43412_ <dig> .

modulation of the host ubiquitin proteasome pathways by viral proteins is thought to affect viral pathogenesis, and four proteins have been identified in the wssv   which interact with the p. monodon ubiquitination pathway  in shrimp) and act as viral e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligases to inhibit apoptosis and affect viral pathogenesis  <cit> . injection of recombinant fenneropenaeus chinensis ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> has been shown to reduce the mortality of shrimp challenged with wssv, inhibit replication of wssv and bind to  wssv ring domain-containing proteins  <cit> , and ubiquitin c expression is up-regulated when f. chinensis are challenged by wssv  <cit> . it follows that variation in the structure or expression of e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme  or other enzymes involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, could be important in affecting the resistance or susceptibility of p. monodon to wssv. variation in a snp in a transcript with homology to the ubiquitin domain-containing protein ubfd <dig> gene  mapping to  <dig>  cm along linkage group  <dig> was found to be associated with wssv resistance in this study . the snps in nine other transcripts with homology to genes involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway  were all found to show suggestive associations or to map closely to other snps significantly or suggestively associated with hours of survival after wssv challenge in this study.

lymphocyte function and heat shock proteins
interleukin enhancer-binding factor  <dig> is a transcription factor required for expression of the interleukin  <dig> gene which regulates the activity of lymphocytes responsible for immunity  <cit> . a snp in a transcript with homology to the gene coding for this factor was found to map 3 cm from a snp  with suggestive association to hours of survival on lg <dig> .

heat shock proteins act as intercellular signalling molecules for the regulation of the immune response of many organisms, particularly with regard to lymphocyte mediated responses  <cit> . the hsp70-hsp <dig> organizing protein  is a co-chaperone that reversibly links hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  moderating chaperone activity. the expression of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> increases in hemocyte and lymphoid organs when crustaceans  are challenged with wssv  <cit> . hsp <dig> is normally highly expressed in p. monodon tissues, but is down-regulated following infection with wssv  <cit> .

the toll pathway
nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells  is a rapid acting primary transcription factor which regulates the innate and adaptive immune cellular response to viral and other forms of infection. when pattern recognition toll-like receptors in t- or b-cells are activated, nf-kb enters the nucleus and up-regulates genes involved in development, maturation and proliferation . large precursor molecules of nf-kb  are processed by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway which involves the degradation of ankyrin repeat c-terminal regions.

“inappropriate” activation of nfkb has been linked to aids, whereas inhibition has been linked to disorders in immune cell development. the stimulation of activator protein  <dig> activity by mitogen-activated protein kinases is thought to elicit stress responses and promote cell survival and death in response to viral infection  <cit> .

mitogen activated protein kinases
protein kinase signal transduction pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, have been shown to have important roles in the regulation of cytokine gene expression , particularly interleukin- <dig>  which is a potent inflammatory cytokine regulating host defence and immune responses  <cit> . mitogen activated protein kinases  are involved in directing cellular responses to a range of stimuli including viral infection. extracellular signal-regulated kinase is a type of serine-threonine specific protein kinase that is activated by wssv in the early stage of infection, and when silenced or inhibited, reduces wssv proliferation, and delays viral early gene transcription, in l. vannamei
 <cit> . the snps in transcripts with homology to mitogen activated protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase organising factor  <dig>  map kinase-activated protein kinase 2-like isoform, serine-threonine protein kinase, interleukin enhancer binding factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase-binding protein  <dig> were found to map near to snps showing suggestive and significant  associations with days survival on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

the mrna binding proteins, such as igf <dig> mrna binding protein , play an important role in stabilizing mrnas during cellular stress  <cit> .

lectin
lectins are non-self-recognition factors thought to be involved in immune recognition and microorganism phagocytosis through opsonisation in crustaceans  <cit> . a snp in a transcript with homology to c-type lectin  maps  <dig>  cm from snp 27976_ <dig> on lg <dig> . tiger shrimp surviving more than 84 hrs post wssv infection have been observed to have higher haemocyte expression of c-type lectin  <cit> . wssv infected l. vannamei that are pre-challenged with wssv shower higher haemocyte expression of c-type lectin than previously naïve individuals  <cit> . lectin is also more highly expressed in the hepatopancreas of resistant l. vannamei
 <cit> , and in the haemocytes and hepatopancreas of resistant m. japonicus
 <cit> , than more susceptible individuals. c-type lectin-like domains have been detected in other genes such as pmav, which are believed to be involved in conferring viral resistance in p. monodon
 <cit> .

runt protein
the runt protein is up-regulated prior to haemocyte release and is known to be involved in haematopoiesis  <cit> . the runt-related transcription factors  play important roles in the development and differentiation of the immune system  <cit>  and mutations in this gene are known to be associated with greater susceptibility to autoimmune disorders  <cit> . the expression of runt domain protein is 40% lower in norwegian lobsters  that are immunologically suppressed by high levels of manganese  <cit> . a snp associated with wssv resistance on lg <dig> , occurred in a transcript which shared high homology to runt protein 1a in the signal crayfish pacifastacus leniusculus.

detection of markers associated with sex
although sex determination is a simply inherited binary trait in most organisms, the precise genetic processes affecting sex determination have been found to be complex and diverse. snp 43522_ <dig> occurs in a transcript for a gene that shares homology with feminization- <dig> , a known signal transducing regulator affecting sex determination in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans
 <cit> . this gene maps to the same position  as snp 49482_ <dig>  is  <dig>  cm from the position of the sex determining locus predicted by gridqtl and is sandwiched  <dig>  cm from snps 48571_ <dig> and 46782_ <dig>  and  <dig>  cm from snps 49245_ <dig> and 49087_ <dig>  all of which are snps found to be significantly associated with sex . fem- <dig>  fem- <dig> and fem- <dig> form a cul-2-based ubiquitin ligase complex which promotes proteolysis of the male-repressing transcription factor tra- <dig>  which is a regulator of sex determination by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis  <cit> . fem- <dig> is the substrate recognition subunit in the complex, while fem- <dig> and fem- <dig> act as cofactors  <cit> . maternal fem- <dig> transcripts have been shown to prevent epigenetic silencing of fem- <dig>  which is believed to help protect the identity and integrity of the germ line  <cit> . comparative mapping was unable to verify whether this is the same region containing the aflp marker developed by  <cit>  for sexing p. monodon.

for snp marker 49245_ <dig>  which showed the strongest association with sex, most males were aa genotypes while most females were ag genotypes. however, for family  <dig> there was a high proportion of ag male offspring  and high proportion of gg female offspring . in this instance the male parent had marker genotype ag  such that zz males were either genotypes aa or ag, and wz females were either genotypes ag or gg, at the marker locus. possible explanations for other discrepancies  are that recombination between the marker and sex determining locus occurred, that more than one gene in this linkage group effects sex determination, that environmental conditions during development are also influencing sex determination and/or that some homogametic females naturally occur. these discrepancies highlight that use of a single snp marker locus for identifying sex will not be possible until the causative mutations for sex determination are identified.

in summary, indications are that the markers identified by this study, could be useful for the purpose of identifying homogametic females. detailed studies of mutations and phenotypes in candidate genes mapping in this region of linkage group  <dig>  could lead us to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms affecting sexual dimorphism in p. monodon. in other invertebrates such as c. elegans there are a diversity of molecules and control networks involved in sex determination  <cit> . the models for sex determination developed for c. elegans and other invertebrates such as drosophila melanogaster will be informative.

application to marker assisted or genomic selection
further research is needed to predict the most effective means of using the markers identified here to assist the genetic improvement of wssv resistance. consideration needs to be given to the overall goals of the breeding programs to which marker information is applied. in  <dig>  meuwissen et al.
 <cit>  devised a method for the prediction of total genetic value using genome-wide dense marker maps, without phenotypic information, which has otherwise become known as genomic selection . with the development of new low-cost fully-automated genotyping technologies, use of genome wide dense marker information is becoming more feasible for many species, especially for traits where direct measurement of the performance of individuals is problematic, such as disease resistance. gs uses information about genome-wide marker associations to estimate the breeding value of candidate individuals.

validation using a population of tested and genotyped training individuals is necessary to estimate the effects at each genomic interval for gs. effects estimated at numerous evenly spaced loci across the genome, including the qtl marker loci identified in this study, could be used to calculate genomic estimated breeding values for genomic selection. the weighting placed on each marker in the overall breeding value would depend on the relative allele substitution effect, and standard error, for each qtl  and on the emphasis placed on marker and/or phenotypic information for other traits included in the selection index. estimation of these allele substitution effects differs, depending on the method and training populations used for their calculation. linkage analysis within families tended to estimate higher allele substitution effects than gwas across families . over-estimation of the size of the qtl effect was expected  <cit> , particularly as selective genotyping was used in this study. selective genotyping using sparse markers has been predicted to be effective for gs  <cit> . higher emphasis for gs might be given to individuals inheriting favourable alleles at snp marker loci such as 25133_ <dig> where the estimate of the allele substitution effect is relatively large.

CONCLUSIONS
from evidence in the available literature, genes affecting the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, lymphocyte-cell function, heat shock protein function, the toll pathway, protein kinase signal transduction pathways, mrna-binding proteins, lectins and the development and differentiation of the immune system , which were found in this study to closely map to snps on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> suggestively or significantly associated with qtl affecting wssv resistance in p. monodon, are all candidate genes that could be involved in controlling the immune response to this viral disease in this species. sex is associated with the segregation of a number of snps mapping to linkage group  <dig>  the strongest association with sex occurred for  <dig> snps mapping to a  <dig>  cm stretch between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm where the feminisation gene  was positioned . interval mapping predicted that the qtl was positioned at 45 cm. the feminisation gene is known to be an important component of the cul-2-based ubiquitin ligase complex and this complex is known to be involved in the control of sex determination in nematodes by promoting proteolysis of the male-repressing transcription factor tra- <dig>  future efforts to identify the causative genes affecting these traits should focus on the fine mapping of genes in these regions and mutation experiments to elucidate function. this has been an effective strategy for livestock such as dairy cattle where genes affecting musculature  <cit>  and milk composition  <cit>  have been identified. in the meantime, markers found to be associated with wssv resistance could be applied to supplement genetic evaluations made by selective breeding programs for p. monodon  and the efficacy of marker assisted selection for improving resistance to wssv should be further evaluated in this and closely related species such as l. vannamei.
