BACKGROUND
avidin from eukaryotic chicken together with streptavidin from prokaryotic streptomyces avidinii share an unique property not seen in any other known proteins, an extremely high affinity  to its natural ligand, the water-soluble vitamin d-biotin  <cit> . high affinity and stability of the free and complex forms of avidin and biotin  <cit> , the easy attachment of biotin to various target molecules  <cit>  and the non-obtrusive chemical nature of biotin are currently exploited in numerous avidin-biotin based life science applications  <cit> .

avidin is postulated to exist throughout the oviparous vertebrates  <cit>  and has long been known to be the operational biotin-harvester in chicken egg-white, comprising about  <dig> % of the total protein  <cit> . recently, avidin related genes  highly similar to avidin  have also been found in the chicken genome  <cit> , suggesting that in addition to avidin avrs may also play a role in biotin-harvesting. avrs seem to have functional promoter regions  <cit>  and are located in close vicinity of the avidin gene on the chicken male-sex chromosome z  <cit> . interestingly, the total number of avrs is likely to vary between different individuals and even between different cells of the individual chicken  <cit> . the function of the avr gene products is unknown, however, since the proteins encoded by them have not yet been isolated from chicken although mrnas of avr <dig>  avr <dig> and avr <dig> are found during inflammation  <cit> .

since the avidin gene of chicken is the only cloned avidin gene within the vertebrates  <cit> , structure-function and protein engineering studies have long been concentrated on it  <cit> . the three-dimensional structure of chicken avidin has already been determined, too  <cit> . the bacterial homolog of avidin, streptavidin, is also well characterized: the gene encoding steptavidin has been cloned  <cit> , its structure solved  <cit>  and several studies on the biochemical properties and protein engineering of streptavidin have been reported  <cit> .

in order to characterize the proteins encoded by the avrs, avidin related proteins  have recently been produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system and have been demonstrated to be functional biotin-binding proteins like chicken avidin  <cit> . avrs do, however, show unique features when compared to avidin. the avrs differ from avidin, with respect to glycosylation and charge properties, and all avrs except avr <dig> contain an uneven number of cysteine residues in their sequence, which can form inter-subunit disulphide bridges in addition to the intra-subunit disulphide bridges also seen in avidin  <cit> . interestingly, the biotin-binding affinities of avrs have been reported to vary over a wide range of values, avr <dig> being almost as efficient a biotin binder as avidin  <cit>  and avr <dig> showing the lowest affinity for biotin  <cit> . avrs, like avidin, have been found to be very stable proteins, too; avr <dig> has clearly higher thermal stability than avidin  <cit> . recently, we have been able to produce avidin and some avrs in escherichia coli, too  <cit> . the 3d-structure of avr <dig> has been recently determined  <cit> , and we have been able to produce chimeric forms of avidin and avr <dig>  which retained their high biotin affinity and showed improved thermal stability  <cit> .

in this study, we have determined the high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of avr <dig> in complex with the natural ligand, d-biotin. by using site-directed mutagenesis and recombinant expression techniques combined with structural studies, we have been able to characterize some of the structural factors responsible for the varying biochemical properties of the members of the chicken avidin protein family. the results may be utilized in avidin protein engineering aiming to fine-tune the ligand binding properties and thermal stability of avrs and their chimeric forms in experiments needed to expand the tools available in the area of avidin-biotin technology. this study provides insight into the molecular evolution within the avidin family, too.

RESULTS
production and mutagenesis of proteins
several different avrs, avr <dig>  avr <dig>  avr <dig>  avr <dig>  and a novel avidin mutant k111i, were efficiently expressed either in insect cells or using a bacterial expression system as summarised in table 1  <cit> . since wild type avr <dig> was found to form oligomers in solution via disulphide bridges , cys- <dig> of avr <dig> was mutated to ser based on the alignment of avr <dig> with avr <dig> and avr <dig> . the resulting protein avr <dig> , as well as all of the other studied proteins, were found to form avidin-like tetramers according to analysis by size exclusion chromatography  and confirmed to be pure and homogenous using sds-page. the elution time of avr <dig> was slightly different from that of avidin and of the other studied avrs, which can partially be explained by the different charge properties of these proteins: avr <dig> has a theoretical isoelectric point of  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  for avr <dig>   <dig>  for avr <dig> and  <dig>  for avidin. the effect of glycosylation is also clearly seen by the varying elution times in gel filtration analysis  for avr2-b produced in bacteria  and from insect cells .

purification of avr <dig> and avr <dig> on the 2-iminobiotin column was inefficient and therefore biotin affinity chromatography was used to isolate these proteins. in order to confirm the quality of the protein and correct cleavage of the bacterial signal peptide used in the production of avrs in e. coli, the molecular weight of avr2-b was determined using esi-ms. the mr  determined from the experimental data using four charge states correlates well with the expected mr of  <dig>  da. the final product from e. coli expression carries three additional residues  at the n-terminus as previously reported for avidin produced using the same method  <cit> .

in a previous study, the k109i mutation of avr <dig> was hypothesised to be at least partially responsible for the lower biotin-binding affinity of avr <dig> when compared to other avrs and avidin  <cit> . in order to validate this suggestion, we subjected avrs to mutagenesis. the mutation i109k was introduced into avr <dig> to increase its biotin-binding affinity. likewise, the mutation lys→ile was introduced into both avr <dig> and avidin in order to cross-validate the hypothesis and lower the biotin-binding affinity of avr <dig> and avidin. gel filtration analysis showed that all of the mutated proteins corresponded to tetramers .

x-ray structure of avr2
the x-ray structure of avr2-b in complex with d-biotin was determined at  <dig>  Å resolution. the structure determination statistics are summarized in table  <dig>  as expected based on the sequence alignment , avr <dig> has an overall three-dimensional structure similar to those of avidin   <cit>  and avr <dig>   <cit> . each monomer in the homotetrameric protein has a β-barrel fold of eight β-strands with one end of the barrel adapted to bind d-biotin .

although avr <dig> shares many structural features with avidin and avr <dig>  there are clear differences in their functional properties . the most distinctive structural differences are found around the terminal carboxylate group of d-biotin. in avidin, atom o10b of the terminal carboxylate group of d-biotin is hydrogen bonded to the backbone nitrogen atoms of ala- <dig> and thr- <dig> of the l <dig>  loop  <cit> , whereas in avr <dig> there is only one polar contact between the o10b atom and the backbone nitrogen atom of asp- <dig> of the l <dig>  loop  <cit> . in avr <dig>  the o10b atom of d-biotin forms an additional hydrogen bond to the ne <dig> atom of gln- <dig>  moreover, in avidin, the o10a atom of the carboxylate group of biotin is hydrogen bonded to the og atoms of ser- <dig> and ser- <dig>  while in avr <dig> and avr <dig> there is only one hydrogen bond to the og atom of ser- <dig> .

a few differences are also found around the central aliphatic segment and the bicyclic ring system of d-biotin. leucine in avidin  and avr <dig>  is replaced by glutamine in avr <dig> , and threonine in avidin  and avr <dig>  is replaced by ser- <dig> in avr <dig>  the side-chain atoms of gln- <dig> of avr <dig> not only interact with the valeryl segment of d-biotin, as in the case of the corresponding leu in avidin and avr <dig>  but also with the carboxylate group of d-biotin . the corresponding residue in avr <dig> and avidin is leucine, but glutamine is also found aligned at the equivalent position in other avrs. the presence of the polar head group of gln- <dig> in avr <dig> also affects the type and conformation of the neighbouring residues, such as ser- <dig>  leu- <dig> and arg- <dig> as well as ile- <dig> from another subunit. these residues line the entrance of the biotin-binding pocket: i) ser- <dig> of avr <dig> has two alternative rotamers unlike in the x-ray structure of avidin and avr <dig>  ii) leu- <dig> of avr <dig> is replaced by ser- <dig> in avidin , iii) arg- <dig> of avr <dig> and avr <dig> form a salt bridge with asp- <dig> from the l <dig>  loop, but arg- <dig> has a different conformation in avr <dig> than in avr <dig>  and iv) ile- <dig> of avr <dig> is substituted by lys- <dig> in avidin and by lys- <dig> in avr <dig>  in addition, ile- <dig> of avr <dig> is located next to trp- <dig>  a residue known to be important for biotin binding  <cit> , but ile- <dig> does not appear to alter the conformation of this residue significantly in comparison to avidin and avr <dig>  all of these differences are located at the open end of the biotin-binding pocket and are very likely responsible for the varying biotin binding properties of avidin, avr <dig> and avr <dig>  moreover, although d-biotin adopts a very similar conformation in avidin, avr <dig> and avr <dig>  the biotin-binding network is not identical .

the 1– <dig> subunit interface  is also markedly different in amino acid composition in avr <dig> in comparison with avidin and avr <dig>  in avidin, the subunit contacts are established between the hydrophobic amino acid residues met- <dig>  val- <dig> and ile- <dig>  <cit> , which are in contact with the same set of residues from a neighbouring subunit. in avr <dig>  only valine  is conserved, while met- <dig> and ile- <dig> of avidin are respectively substituted by the hydrophilic residues lys- <dig> and asn- <dig> in avr <dig> . in the crystal structure of avr <dig>  the side chain of lys- <dig> can exist in two alternate rotamers, which are hydrogen bonded either to the side-chain oxygen atom of asn- <dig> or to the main-chain oxygen of val- <dig>  both from a neighbouring subunit . asn- <dig> is also in contact with asn- <dig> from a neighbouring subunit. in avr <dig>  ile- <dig> of avidin is substituted by tyr- <dig>  the latter interacting strongly with tyr- <dig> of an adjacent subunit and through a hydrogen bond to lys- <dig>  <cit> .

comparative analysis of avidin family proteins
previously, it has been found that avr <dig> forms intermonomeric disulphide bridges  <cit> . gel filtration analysis of avr <dig> revealed that these disulphide bonds are formed between tetramers, thus causing further oligomerization of the protein . consequently, we introduced the c58s mutation into avr <dig>  which successfully blocked oligomerisation, and used this mutated protein form in the comparative analyses in the present study.

the overall charge of avr <dig>  is very different when compared to that of avidin and avr <dig> . the number of ionic bonds in avidin is seven per subunit, whereas three salt bridges are seen in avr <dig>  <cit> . in the avr2-biotin complex, four intra-subunit salt bridges are detected: asp-39-arg- <dig>  glu-89-arg- <dig>  lys-92-asp- <dig> and arg-98-asp- <dig> 

biotin dissociation analysis
of the proteins studied, the fastest biotin dissociation rate was found with avr <dig>  while the slowest rate was measured for avidin . ile- <dig> is found close to the biotin-binding site in avr <dig>  whereas all other proteins in avidin family  <cit>  have lysine at the equivalent position. in order to test the effect of ile- <dig> on the biotin dissociation rate, the avr <dig> mutant was produced. the resulting mutant had a significantly slower dissociation rate than the wild-type protein. avr <dig>  in turn, showed a dissociation rate constant in between the values observed for the two avr <dig> forms. the dissociation rate constant for avr <dig>  measured in a previous study  <cit> , was somewhat higher when compared to that of avidin. when lys- <dig> of avr <dig> was mutated to isoleucine according to the sequence of avr <dig>  the rate of dissociation increased as expected, but biotin binding of the resulting protein was still stronger than for the mutated avr <dig> form. similarly, the analogous mutation k111i in avidin increased the biotin dissociation rate compared to the wild-type protein. hence, the analyzed proteins can be sorted according to their biotin-binding affinities : avr <dig> < avr <dig> < avr <dig> < avr <dig> < avr <dig> < avd < avidin .

the biotin dissociation data, measured at various temperatures, were analysed using the global fit method described elsewhere  <cit> . the resulting dissociation rate temperature-dependency model was compared to the one previously measured for avidin  <cit> . the analysis revealed a different temperature-dependency for avr <dig> in comparison to avidin . the mutation i109k caused a shift in the temperature-dependency of avr2-biotin dissociation, resulting in a model resembling that determined for avr <dig>  avr <dig> has a similar temperature-dependency of the biotin dissociation rate as avidin, and the k109i mutation did not significantly change the temperature-dependency although it clearly increased the biotin dissociation rate constant . the equivalent mutation k111i in avidin resulted in a nearly two-fold increase in the biotin dissociation rate over a temperature range of 40–60°c .

differential scanning calorimetry
the thermostability of avidin, avr <dig>  avr <dig> and avr <dig> were measured using dsc analysis . in this analysis, avr <dig> showed higher thermostability than avidin. the measured tm  was between the values measured previously for avidin  and avr <dig>   <cit> . as expected, the thermal stability of avr <dig> increased in the presence of biotin , similarly as reported for avidin, avr <dig> and streptavidin  <cit> . the i109k mutation significantly stabilised avr <dig>  resulting in a  <dig> °c increase in tm as compared to the wild-type protein. the reverse mutation, k109i in avr <dig> and k111i in avidin, led to destabilisation of the proteins, resulting in a  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c decrease in the tm, respectively. interestingly, avr <dig> showed slightly higher thermal stability  than avidin  in the absence of biotin, while in its presence the tm of avr <dig>  was raised significantly but remained lower than that measured for the avidin-biotin complex .

discussion
in the present study, we have used targeted mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography combined with the comparative analysis of thermal stability and ligand-binding kinetics to dissect the functional properties of the chicken avidin protein family. the high-resolution structure of avr <dig>  a close relative of avidin, provides new insights into the biotin-binding mechanism of the avidins and serves as a new source of knowledge for protein engineering studies, too.

in order to understand the observed differences in the biotin-binding affinities and thermal stabilities within the avidin protein family, the crystal structures of avidin  <cit> , avr <dig>  and avr <dig>  <cit>  were compared, all in complex with d-biotin. overall, these proteins share high structural similarity and their ligand-binding sites within the eight-strand β-barrel resemble each other. the most distinctive structural differences are found around the terminal carboxylate group and central valeryl segment of d-biotin. in the avr <dig> structure, d-biotin is in contact with the l <dig>  loop as in the case of avidin  <cit>  and avr <dig>  <cit> , but also in contact with the side-chain atom of gln- <dig> unlike the avidin or avr <dig> complexes where leucine is found at the equivalent position. glutamine is conserved in all of the avrs except for avr <dig>  <cit> , resides  <dig>  Å away from d-biotin in the avr <dig> structure, and a hydrogen bond may form between gln- <dig> and biotin even though the angle is not optimal. in addition to d-biotin, gln- <dig> seems to form a hydrogen bond with ser- <dig>  which exists in two alternative conformations. the presence of gln- <dig> in avr <dig> probably affects the conformation of nearby arg- <dig>  which is slightly displaced with respect to the corresponding residue seen in avr <dig> and avidin. then again, the conformation of arg- <dig> may be altered due to interactions with the avr2-specific ile- <dig>  too. ile- <dig> of avr <dig> respectively corresponds to lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> in avidin and avr <dig>  in avr <dig>  ile- <dig> resides close to trp- <dig>  which is known to be important for biotin binding  <cit> , but the conformation of trp- <dig> does not seem to be significantly affected by ile- <dig>  yet another sequence difference, whereby thr- <dig> of avidin and the corresponding threonine of avr <dig>  is substituted to ser in avr <dig> does not appear to disrupt hydrogen bonding to the sulfur atom of d-biotin. however, this substitution enlarges the binding cavity around bound biotin  and hence contributes to the lower affinity of avr <dig> for biotin. the biotin-binding network is not identical in avidin, avr <dig> and avr <dig> despite the similar conformation that d-biotin adopts in all of these structures. in general, the polar contacts with d-biotin seem to be much more variable than the hydrophobic ones, which are highly conserved, indicating their important role in the biotin-binding process. in line with this, the importance of hydrophobic residues for biotin-binding of streptavidin has been demonstrated experimentally  <cit> . moreover, the interactions of avidin, avr <dig> and avr <dig> with the carboxylate group of d-biotin are clearly less conserved than the interactions with the central aliphatic valeryl segment and the bicyclic ring system of the tetrahydrothiophenic and ureido rings buried deeper within the biotin binding pocket  <cit> .

based on the temperature-dependence of the biotin dissociation rates and relative biotin dissociation rate constants , the order of the biotin binding affinities is as follows: avr <dig> < avr <dig> < avr <dig> < avidin. these results are in line with the previous ligand-binding analyses performed for avrs using an optical biosensor  <cit> . furthermore, the presence of an isoleucine residue at sequence position  <dig> in avr <dig> rather than lysine seems to be the most dominant difference affecting biotin binding in comparison to avr <dig>  however, this sequence variation does not explain the differences in the biotin-binding properties of avr <dig> versus avr <dig>  this was confirmed by analysing the avr <dig> mutant, which showed significantly stronger interactions with biotin when compared to wild-type avr <dig>  moreover, the equivalent mutation k111i in avidin affected only slightly the dissociation rate constant of avidin. the temperature-dependency model suggests even slower dissociation rates at low temperatures for the mutant compared to wild-type avidin . the different effects of the lys→ile mutation on avidin versus avr <dig> may reflect differences at the l <dig>  loop of avidin and avrs. although the avr2-biotin dissociation rate was over 5000-fold higher at 20°c than that of avidin and thus showed significantly lower biotin-binding affinity than avidin, the thermal stability of avr <dig> in the absence of biotin is higher  than for avidin . higher thermal stability is notable and may have a functional role.

the biological role of avrs is unclear; avidin is thought to work as a biotin-harvester in chicken egg-white, thus preventing growth of biotin-dependent organisms  <cit> . the lower biotin-binding affinity and higher stability of avr <dig> raises the question if avr <dig> has any biological role similar to avidin. the expression of avidin is induced in chicken during inflammation in various tissues and mrnas of some avrs, including avr <dig>  have been detected during inflammation  <cit> . this suggests that avr <dig>  may play a role in inflammatory reactions.

the conformation of the l <dig>  loop of avr <dig> was found to strongly resemble that of avr <dig>  <cit> . in avidin, this loop is disordered in the absence and ordered in the presence of d-biotin  <cit> . in contrast, the l <dig>  loop of avr <dig> was previously found to be in an nearly identical, fixed conformation both in the absence and presence of d-biotin  <cit> . the latter situation seems to be true for all avr proteins, since the l <dig>  loop per se, as well as the neighbouring sequences between the β <dig> and β <dig> strands, are highly conserved within the avr family but quite different from avidin  <cit> . recently, this region was transferred to avidin from avr <dig>  <cit> . the resultant chimeric chiavd showed better thermal stability  than avidin   <cit>  and, interestingly, the observed stability of avr <dig>  and its mutant avr <dig>  was similar to that of chiavd. hence, in addition to the 1– <dig> subunit interface, the region between the β <dig> and β <dig> strands of avr <dig> is likely to affect the stability of the protein . this view is supported by our preliminary results of engineered dual chain avidins suggesting only slightly better stability for the avr2-type 1– <dig> interface compared to the 1– <dig> interface of avidin .

the present study provides novel knowledge of the structural characteristics of avr proteins. avidin related proteins are considered as an individual branch in the evolutionary tree of avidins in chicken  <cit> . based on the results of the current study , avr <dig> and avr <dig> seem to be functionally closely related to each other, supporting the previous phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . it seems that the critical difference, isoleucine at position  <dig> in avr <dig> in comparison to lysine in avidin and the other avrs, has arisen after the divergence of avr <dig> and the rest of avrs. this sequence difference also explains why avr <dig> has the lowest observed biotin-binding affinity among the avrs. all avrs have a region between β <dig> and β <dig> strands, which is quite different from that in avidin  <cit> . in comparison with the other avrs, this region in avr <dig> shares a higher level of similarity with avidin. this likely correlates with the high, avidin-like biotin-affinity of avr <dig> versus the lower biotin-affinity of the other avrs  <cit> .

ligand binding to avidin and streptavidin can be considered as an extreme discovery of nature in the sense of affinity and free energy  <cit> . the structural complementarity between biotin and its binding site in avidin is almost perfect, which together with the numerous hydrogen bonds that are formed between avidin and biotin is the basis for the extraordinary tight binding  <cit> . thus, it is not surprising to find that a small perturbation in this highly perfected system can reverberate as a major change in the biotin binding kinetics. it is known that the high biotin-binding affinity of avidin is dominated by extremely slow ligand dissociation rates, especially in the case of avidin.

CONCLUSIONS
the high-resolution structure of avr <dig> combined with the ligand binding data broadens our understanding of the general principles of ligand-binding processes. furthermore, the structural information can be employed as a basis to create improved tools for biotechnology. this was demonstrated in a previous study, where chimeric forms of avidin and avr <dig> showed improved properties compared to the native proteins  <cit> .
