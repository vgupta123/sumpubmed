BACKGROUND
various marker systems, ranging from low-density restriction fragment length polymorphisms  to high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms , have been developed and utilized successfully in wheat for genetic diversity analysis, complex trait dissection, and marker-assisted breeding  <cit> . anchoring molecular markers on chromosomes and constructing a genetic linkage map are pre-requisites for their utilization in breeding  <cit> .

advances in next-generation technologies have driven the costs of dna sequencing down to the point that genotyping based on sequence data is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. genotyping methods usually involve restriction enzyme digestion of target genomes to reduce the complexity at a reasonable cost  <cit> . davey et al.  <cit>  grouped approaches that apply genome complexity reduction methods into the following classes: reduced-representation sequencing, restriction-site-associated dna sequencing , low coverage genotyping including multiplexed shotgun genotyping  and genotyping by sequencing . all of these methods are more or less similar technically. the diversity arrays technology , canberra, australia , has developed a gbs platform known as dart-seq, which provides an opportunity to select genome fractions corresponding predominantly to active genes. restriction enzymes used in this method separate low copy sequences from the repetitive fraction of the genome. these low copy sequences are informative for marker discovery. representative fragments are then sequenced on next generation sequencing  platforms  <cit> . using a combination of restriction enzymes, dartseq gbs offers affordable genome profiling through generation of high-density snps as well as pav  markers  <cit> . in a standard dart assay, approximately  <dig>  genomic fragments are sequenced  <dig> times, on average, with approximately  <dig> , <dig> tags per sample. as a significant percentage of samples in each experiment are processed in duplicate , all sequence variants that are not legitimate snp markers are filtered out. large numbers of additional metadata produced by the analytical pipeline  make further marker selection and sorting easy, and enable users to choose specific groups of markers that are most useful for their applications  <cit> .

the gbs platform has been used for genetic characterization of more than  <dig>  wheat germplasm accessions held by cimmyt as part of its seeds of discovery  initiative. a genetic map of gbs markers would be an important prerequisite for trait-based genetic analysis of this large diversity panel. the validity and usefulness of a genetic map depends on its suitability for mapping genomic regions correctly and precisely. in wheat, the ug <dig> group of stem rust fungus puccinia graminis pers. f. sp. tritici eriks. & e. henn. is described as a major forthcoming threat to global wheat production  <cit> . mapping and deploying adult plant resistance  genes in popular high yielding but susceptible varieties is needed by wheat breeders. to date, more than  <dig> apr genes have been identified through qtl analyses  <cit>  and some of them  are well characterized and widely used in breeding. genetic maps that can identify apr genes would be useful for marker-assisted selection , map-based cloning and detailed molecular characterization in wheat breeding. in this study, three recombinant inbred line  populations, pbw343 × kingbird, pbw343 × kenya swara and pbw343 × muu , were used to anchor the gbs tags to wheat chromosomes. therefore, the objectives of our investigation were to construct a consensus map of gbs markers and validate known apr genes/qtl against stem rust, yellow rust and leaf rust through mapping, and by comparing them with wheat reference genome sequences recently published by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium, rye and ae. tauschii genomes.

RESULTS
marker distribution in the consensus map and three individual maps
three ril populations were analyzed using gbs tags. in total,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> markers were mapped on pb-kb, pb-ks and pb-mu populations, respectively . using genotype data of the three populations, a consensus genetic map was constructed by assigning  <dig> markers to wheat chromosomes with  <dig> unique positions . the maximum ratio of unique positions on the consensus map was located on chromosome 4d , whereas chromosome 2d harbored the minimum ratio of unique positions . of the  <dig> markers of the consensus map,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were mapped on the a, b and d genomes, respectively . on average, the a, b and d genomes covered distances of  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm, and  <dig>  cm, respectively.table  <dig>

total genetic length of the consensus map was  <dig>  cm , and average marker distance was  <dig>  cm, reached by calculating the average distance between two adjacent unique positions. the length of  <dig> marker intervals, corresponding to  <dig> % of total marker intervals by  <dig> unique positions, ranged from  <dig> to 1 cm . in all three populations,  <dig> % of markers on the consensus map were found to be polymorphic;  <dig> % of markers were polymorphic in one of the three populations, and  <dig> % of them were polymorphic in two of the three populations . compared to the three individual maps, the number of markers in common between any two individual maps was roughly 43% of the number of markers in the map with the least markers of the two . for example, there were  <dig> markers in common between pb-mu and pb-kb, which was 3002/6936 =  <dig> % of the number of markers in the pb-muu map. also, there were  <dig> markers in common between pb-kb and pb-ks, which was 5792/13123 =  <dig> % of the number of markers in the pb-kb map. similarly, there were  <dig> markers in common among the three maps, which was 1189/6936 =  <dig> % of the number of markers in the pb-mu map.figure  <dig>

segregation distortion across the three ril populations
segregation distortions were estimated in the three ril populations. for pb-kb, pb-ks, and pb-mu,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  markers, respectively showed evidence of segregation distortion at the  <dig>  significance level. the most significant  segregation distortion regions  were observed in pb-kb, followed by the pb-mu and pb-ks populations . the highest significant sdr was in chromosome 6bl detected in pb-kb, where -logp reached  <dig> , and selection favored alleles from pbw <dig>  in both pb-kb and pb-mu, sdrs detected in chromosome 3bs are near the sr <dig> gene, where selection favored alleles from pbw <dig>  an sdr detected in pb-ks on chromosome 7ds was in the region around the lr <dig> gene, designated by dyck  <cit> , for resistance to leaf rust. in this region, selection favored alleles from kenya swara. among all chromosomes in the three ril populations, high segregation distortion was observed on chromosome 1b and selection favoring pbw <dig> figure  <dig>

distribution of the recombinant inbred lines against wheat rusts
large variations for stem rust were observed in the three rils populations. screening for yellow and leaf rusts was also carried out  to detect pleiotropic loci linked with yellow and leaf rust resistance. phenotypic variations for leaf and yellow rusts were observed as well, but smaller than those for stem rust . in the ms <dig>  screening, percent stem rust severity in the pb-kb, pb-ks and pb-mu populations ranged from 10% to 70%, 1% to 60%, and 0% to 80%, respectively. during ms <dig> , it ranged from 0% to 60%, 1% to 80%, and  <dig> to 80% in the pb-kb, pb-ks and pb-mu populations, respectively; in ms <dig> , percent severity varied from 1% to 100% in population pb-mu; and in os <dig> , it was 5% to 80%, 0% to 100%, and  <dig> % to  <dig> % in pb-kb, pb-ks and pb-mu populations, respectively. population pb-ks was screened for yellow rust in t <dig> , with percent severity ranging from 0% to 100%, and for leaf rust in ob <dig> , with percent severity ranging from  <dig> to 100%.figure  <dig>

apr qtls mapped on individual population linkage maps
eighteen qtl regions, projected on the consensus map, were detected to be associated with apr to stem/yellow/leaf rusts in three ril mapping populations . qtls were distributed on  <dig> chromosomes, i.e., 1b, 2a, 2b, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3d, 4a, 5b, 6b, 6d, 7a, and 7d. well-characterized genomic regions associated with rust resistance  were identified on chromosomes 1bl, 3bs and 7ds, respectively. genes sr <dig>  sr <dig> and sr <dig> explained phenotypic variances of up to  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively . positive alleles for the effects of sr <dig> and sr <dig> were contributed by non-pbw <dig> parents in all three populations. a positive allele for the effect of sr <dig> from pbw <dig> was detected in population pb-ks across trials, which may be the reason for this population’s transgressive stem and yellow rust resistance .table  <dig>

comparison of consensus map with wheat genome reference sequence
a draft of the wheat genome sequence was published very recently  <cit> . to verify the consensus map in this study, we blast the sequences of  <dig> gbs markers  against the genome sequence of chinese spring  <cit> , rye, and the d genome of ae. tauschii with e-value < 1e- <dig>  in general, sequences of  <dig> gbs markers  cannot hit to the genome sequence of chinese spring, and sequences of  <dig> % of gbs markers cannot be mapped to the same chromosome in the genome sequence of chinese spring as that on the consensus map. genome-wide sequences of  <dig> % of gbs markers can be mapped to the same chromosome in the chinese spring genome sequence as that on the consensus map . this ratio ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> % across the  <dig> wheat chromosomes . for chromosome 1b, there was a very clear enrichment for rye hits indicating the 1b/1r translocation . there were increased hits to ae. tauschii on the d genome .figure  <dig>

discussion
gbs is a preferred high-throughput genotyping method involving targeted complexity reduction and multiplex sequencing to produce high-quality polymorphism data at a relatively low cost per sample. three ril populations sharing one common parent  were genotyped using the gbs approach. a consensus genetic linkage map distributed by  <dig> markers was developed with  <dig> unique positions  covering a  <dig>  cm genetic distance . recently, a wheat genetic map of  <dig>  snp markers was reported  <cit>  where data were generated with the help of snp iselect array comprising ~  <dig>  snps. on this map,  <dig> % of snps were specified to unique positions. the percentage of unique positions in the two maps was comparable. fewer numbers of unique markers on chromosomes were partially due to the lack of polymorphic markers evenly distributed on wheat genome, and the lack of recombination events captured by these populations.

compared with the a and d genomes, in the b genome, the maximum percentage of the total number of markers , the maximum percentage of the total number of unique positions , the longest genetic length , and the maximum number of detected qtl regions can be observed . these results indicate that most of the recombination events happened on the b genome, which was in accordance with previously reported genetic maps  <cit>  and also with genome size, since the b genome is the largest, followed by genomes a and d. variation in the d genome of bread wheat is consistently low  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> % of markers on the consensus map were located on the d genome . yet in some regions , a high number of markers with unique positions can be observed . four qtl regions were detected on the d genome . this map can be a useful resource for finding more genes located on the d genome to dissect the traits of interest.

in terms of the marker distribution across populations, the highest number of polymorphic markers was available in the pb-ks population, followed by pb-kb and pb-mu . when comparing the maps from different populations, the number of markers in common between any two maps was approximately 43% of the number of markers on the smaller map . the number of markers on all three maps was  <dig> % of the number of markers on the smallest map. the reduced percentage of markers in common to all maps may be due to the known structural diversity among the parents and the varying recombination frequency patterns across the genome for the three crosses. these trends indicate pbw <dig> may have the largest genetic distance from kenya swara, compared with kingbird and muu.

although we had  <dig> markers on the consensus map, polymorphism markers are still lacking in some chromosome regions of the respective ril population. possible reasons are:  vast parts of the chromosomes of the triticeae are recombination deserts   <cit> , so most meiotic recombination events occur in genomic regions that correspond to ~20% of the chromosome length, while there is little recombination in 1/ <dig> to 2/ <dig> of the chromosome; in the region of recombination deserts, it is difficult to explore polymorphic markers; and  the different variations among four parental genomes, and different genetic distances between pbw <dig> and the other three parents . in our study, the numbers of linkage groups for the consensus map and each of the three mapping populations were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . if two markers are physically located on the same chromosome but very far away from each other, it is very likely that they will act as unlinked loci in a population of limited size. due to the recombination desert between them, they will fall into different linkage groups.

a popular variety in south asia, pbw <dig> is known for harboring the 1b/1r translocation. on the consensus map, there are  <dig> markers located on chromosome 1b, with around  <dig> markers on its short arm  and  <dig> markers on its long arm . only  <dig> % of  <dig> markers on chromosome 1b were located uniquely, which is a low proportion across  <dig> chromosomes. looking at chromosome 1b specifically,  <dig> % of markers are located uniquely on chromosome 1bs, while  <dig> % of markers are located uniquely on chromosome 1bl. in other words, the vast majority of markers on chromosome 1bs are represented in the map as clusters of co-segregating markers. interestingly, high segregation distortion was observed in the three populations on chromosome 1b as compared to the others . also, regions on chromosome 1b having low hits to the chinese spring genome clearly had high hits to the rye genome . these phenomena could be assigned to the 1b/1r rye translocation in pbw <dig>  in addition to the 1b/1r translocation, translocations 2d/2r and 7b/4r have also been reported in wheat. rye has been used extensively in cimmyt wheat breeding, and the three parents  used in this study were derived from cimmyt germplasm. in our study, we could not find evidence of these parents carrying the 2d/2r and 7b/4r translocations.

the consensus map constructed in this study can be used to locate major genes controlling target traits. phenotypic variation in the three ril populations suggests polygenic inheritance for apr to stem rust race ug <dig> . qtl analysis revealed a couple of apr qtls against stem rust fungus ug <dig>  which were mapped as reported. to anchor and determine the relationship between the apr qtls found in the present study and those found in previous reports , we calculated the correlation coefficient of the genotypes of array-based dart markers and dart-seq markers on the consensus map. array-based dart markers wpt- <dig> and wpt- <dig> are reported to be linked with apr to stem rust  <cit> . qtl qsr.cim-2bs <dig> reported in this study was flanked by dart-seq markers, i.e.,  <dig> and  <dig>  the correlation between  <dig> and wpt- <dig> was  <dig>  in population pb-mu, which is highly significant. dart-seq markers  <dig> and  <dig> were the two markers flanking qsr.cim-5bl . the correlation between wpt- <dig> and dart-seq marker  <dig> was  <dig>  in population pb-mu, which is highly significant as well . a qtl on chromosome 3bs, which is most likely the sr <dig> gene  was flanked by dart-seq markers  <dig> and  <dig> in population pb-muu. according to the consensus map reported by yu et al.  <cit> , the sr <dig> gene is  <dig>  cm apart from the array-based dart marker wpt- <dig>  marker  <dig> was highly correlated with wpt- <dig> in population pb-muu . a gene for leaf rust resistance on chromosome 7ds was mapped and flanked by dart-seq markers  <dig> and  <dig> . the correlation between  <dig> and wpt- <dig> was  <dig> , which is highly significant. array-based dart marker wpt- <dig> was associated with leaf rust resistance and was found to be 9 cm apart from lr <dig> gene-based marker cslv <dig> in the pbw343 × diniza population . in addition to marker co-location for the above mentioned qtls/gene, a recently published consensus map for ug <dig> stem rust resistance loci in wheat  <cit>  was compared with qtls mapped in this study. since this map did not contain gbs markers, exact co-location could not be made. however, based on the location of apr qtls on chromosome arms for some of the qtls, i.e., qsr.cim-2bs <dig>  qsr.cim-2bs <dig>  qsr.cim-2bl, qsr.cim-2ds, qsr.cim-3al, qsr.cim-3ds, qsr.cim-1bl <dig> and qsr.cim-6dl could be co-located with the ones projected on the consensus map of ug <dig> stem rust resistance  <cit> . singh et al.  <cit>  also reported an apr qtl for ug <dig> on chromosome 7as, which is likely the same as the one on that chromosome in the present study . qsr.cim-3bs <dig>  qsr.cim-3bs <dig>  qsr.cim-4as, and qsr/yr.cim-6bl were new qtl regions associated with stem rust and yellow rust.

the high density gbs consensus map increased the mapping resolution of linkage mapping. identified genomic regions  for stem rust resistance ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm . the interval size of  <dig> of the qtls was < =1 cm and most of them were  < 5 cm . qtls in genomic regions of this size are valuable for further understanding the molecular basis and developing perfectly linked markers. co-location of the apr qtls/genes in their respective chromosomal regions  and a high proportion of markers blast to the correct chromosomes of the genome sequence of chinese spring  indicate the validity and utility of the consensus map.

cimmyt’s seeds of discovery project has characterized more than  <dig>  wheat gene bank accessions through the dartseq gbs platform. the high density gbs consensus map reported in this study is an essential prerequisite for analyzing the gbs data of a large diversity panel. it will facilitate the genetic dissection of important quantitative traits either by linkage mapping as we reported in this paper, or by genome-wide association mapping. gbs markers associated with important traits can be utilized by designing primers according to their sequence, for genomics applications in wheat breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
a high density map of  <dig> gbs markers using genotypic data of the three ril populations with a common parent, pbw <dig>  total genetic length of map was  <dig>  cm with  <dig> unique positions, and the average marker distance was  <dig>  cm by calculating the averaged distance between two adjacent unique positions. the length of marker intervals ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  cm. the number of markers in common between any two individual maps was roughly 43% of the number of markers in the map with the least markers of the two. significant variation of segregation distortion was observed across three populations. three genes  and  <dig> published qtl were validated. the common parent pbw <dig> harbors the 1b/1r translocation, and there was a very clear enrichment for rye hits on chromosome 1b. also, there were increased hits to ae. tauschii d genome. the high-density and better quality of genetic maps will advance the genetic studies of complex trait in wheat and facilitate genomics-assisted breeding.
