BACKGROUND
the genus brucella comprises gram-negative bacteria that are the etiological agents of brucellosis, a zoonosis that represents one of the most important worldwide disease affecting animals and humans, especially in the mediterranean areas  <cit> . the disease can be transmitted to humans directly by contact with infected animals or indirectly by contaminated dairy products. brucella infections can cause chronic debilitating diseases in humans with the involvement of multiple organs and low mortality while in the domesticated animals can lead to reproductive failure with subsequent economic loss. six classically species are recognized within the genus brucella: brucella abortus , brucella melitensis , brucella suis , brucella ovis, brucella canis, and brucella neotomae  <cit> . isolation and characterization of novel different brucella strains from a wide variety wildlife species from terrestrial and marine mammals, recently classified as three additional species, b. ceti  b. pinnipedialis and b. microti underline the importance of wildlife as reservoir for zoonotic brucellosis  <cit> . in addition, brucella spp. represent potential biological warfare agents due to the high contagious rates for humans and animals  <cit> . therefore it is very important to have a strain typing epidemiological tool for source trace back in outbreaks of infection. characterization of brucella at species and biovar level can be performed by differential microbiological approaches used for phenotyping  <cit> . however, these biotyping methods are time consuming and potentially hazardous for laboratory personnel. in addition, the limited variation among some species and biovars may result in conflicting data and complicate interpretation  <cit> . biotyping methods are not therefore suitable for epidemiological tracking where a more accurate identification is necessary. thus, genetic characterization using molecular dna technology has been investigated and several molecular techniques for subtyping have been proposed. in the last years pcr-based assays have been employed in an attempt to find suitable dna markers for the molecular typing of brucella. examples are repetitive intergenic palindromic sequence-pcr   <cit> , random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr   <cit> , arbitrary primed-pcr   <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , single nucleotide polymorphism   <cit> , and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism   <cit> . recently, a highly discriminatory typing system called mlva, based on multilocus characterization of variable number of tandem repeats , has been proposed for several pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae  <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , bacillus anthracis and yersinia pestis  <cit> . the multilocus vntr analysis methods  were also described for brucella genotyping  <cit> . the mlva- <dig> is based on  <dig> polymorphic markers subdivided in two panels: the panel  <dig>  consisting of  <dig> minisatellite markers with a good species identification capability, and the panel  <dig>  consisting of  <dig> microsatellite markers with higher discriminatory power. mlva- <dig> assay generates multiple band profiles or fingerprint patterns and represents a useful molecular approach for brucella typing in spite of the high dna homology among brucella species   <cit> . the obtained mlva band profiles may be resolved by different techniques ranging from low cost manual agarose gels to the more expensive capillary electrophoresis sequencing systems. recently, a rapid and inexpensive method based on the lab on a chip technology  has been proposed. this miniaturized platform for electrophoresis applications is able to size and quantitate pcr fragments, and was previously used for studying the genetic variability of bcia gene of bacillus cereus  <cit>  and for genotyping of bacillus anthracis and yersinia pestis  <cit> . in this paper we evaluate the possibility to use the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer equipment for mlva typing of brucella strains using the selected subset of  <dig> loci proposed by la flèche  <cit> . on that account, we analyzed by agilent technology the collection of seventeen human brucella isolates whose mlva fingerprinting profiles were previously resolved by capillary electrophoresis sequencing system  <cit>  and results compared, while twelve dna samples, provided in  <dig> for a mlva vntr ring trial, were de novo genotyped.

RESULTS
in order to set up this method, we analyzed, by mlva- <dig>  <cit>  on agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer, seventeen brucella strains previously identified as b. melitensis biovar  <dig> by direct sequencing  <cit> . the  <dig> vntr markers amplified for bacterial genotyping were arranged into three duplex and nine singleplex pcr reactions. the arrangement of different loci in the same multiplex was such to avoid overlapping of vntr markers size ranges; in this way it was possible to use a single 12-wells chip  for strain analysis. after pcr amplification  <dig> μl of each reaction was loaded into the chip and the amplification product size estimates were obtained by the agilent software. these values showed discrepancies compared with those expected  <cit> , making difficult the allele assignment directly from rough data. in order to assign the correct alleles to the agilent dna fragment sizes, a conversion table containing for each locus the expected size, the range of observed sizes, including arithmetical average ± standard deviation, and the corresponding allele was produced . we could establish experimentally the variability range for each allele. even if we didn't conduct an extensive study on migration, these ranges were determined considering interchip/intrachip variability from the same amplification product or different amplification of the same strain allele or, for the same alleles, different strain amplification . the data are considered valuable only if standard deviation is lower than the 50% of the repeat unit length. in this way, we could measure a variation proportionated to the relative number of nucleotides in each repeat unit. all the allele measurements satisfied this criterion, allowing the unambiguous assignment of the correct allele to each observed value . in order to validate this platform, we analyzed twelve unknown samples provided by dr. falk melzer for mlva brucella  <dig> ring trial  <cit> . the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer mlva- <dig> products were separated and dna fragment sizes were correlated to the alleles by the conversion table. the resulting fingerprint for each strain was matched against the mlva database brucella test  <cit> , allowing identification of samples and their genetic relationship with the other database strains . the identified species were compared with the vntr ring trial results  <cit> , obtaining a full concordance.

discussion
the renewed threat of biological weapons and the appearance of zoonotic infections caused by brucella spp. have reinforced the need to provide a rapid and specific detection method for the characterization of brucella isolates. in fact, the discrimination between natural outbreaks and/or intentional release of micro-organism agents may be of crucial importance in the context of the bioterrorism. brucella strains differentiation in the last years was obtained by assays based on the analysis of the polymorphism of tandemly repeated dna sequences. this strategy has proven to be appropriate for pathogenic bacterial species typing with a high genetic homogeneity. recently a new multilocus vntr analysis  method, based on a subset of fifteen tandem repeat loci, was described demonstrating high discriminatory power  <cit> . the different alleles, amplified by standard pcr techniques, can be analyzed by several electrophoretic techniques that can be time-consuming as agarose gel, or require high costs for reagents and instruments as capillary electrophoresis sequencing. our attention was addressed on the agilent  <dig> "lab on a chip" platform, in order to obtain a more rapid and inexpensive method of discrimination. the loading of the fifteen amplification products in a single chip provides an increased time-reduction  as compared to assay run on agarose gels for the same analysed markers. after data collection and analysis, we observed that the size estimated by the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer were shifted by a variable value  in respect to the real size. indeed, the estimated sizes were shifted of a variable value  respect to the real size estimated by sequencing and each offset showed a variable range. these differences could be due to the different nature of the gel matrix or to a slightly biased flanking sequence or repeat unit specific mobility pattern  <cit> . these discrepancies between observed and expected sizes have been overcome creating a correspondence table which allows for each observed value to assign the expected size and corresponding allele . the comparison of the results obtained by the multilocus vntr analysis  method  <cit>  on the agilent  <dig> "lab on a chip" platform showed a good size correlation with nucleotide sequence analysis, confirming the rapidity and efficiency of this platform respect to standard sequencing or ethidium bromide slab gel electrophoresis. furthermore, the possibility to compare different chip data in different times made the system suitable for epidemiological purposes. we consider this system one the most promising platforms for mlva- <dig> typing because offers a fair compromise among costs, speed and specificity compared to any of the conventional molecular typing techniques.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper is described a rapid, accurate and reproducible system for genotyping of brucella. the method is based on multiple locus variable number tandem repeats  analysis  assay with  <dig> markers , previously described, and the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer, for the separation of nucleic acid molecules. the validation of the system was performed reanalyzing seventeen dna samples, previously genotyped by traditional techniques, and twelve dna provided for a vntr ring trials, obtaining a general concordance of the results. therefore mlva typing data produced by agilent system represents an alternative to standard sequencing or ethidium bromide slab gel electrophoresis.
