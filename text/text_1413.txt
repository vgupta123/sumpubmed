BACKGROUND
grain sorghum is the fifth most important cereal crop, providing food, feed and fiber for the world. sweet sorghum has been evaluated as a viable feed stock for bio-ethanol production due to its high biomass yield and sugar content. both grain and sweet sorghum lines originated from the same species “sorghum bicolor l.”. these lines were found in sorghum landraces but modern sorghum cultivars were domesticated through breeding programs. in addition, they exhibit considerable differences in their phenotype. the grain sorghum genome at× <dig> was first sequenced by methylation filtration technology
 <cit> . on the other hand, the bt× <dig> genome was then completely sequenced by the short-gun sequencing technique and total of  <dig>  loci were annotated with protein-coding transcripts
 <cit> . recently, zheng et al.  have re-sequenced two sweet sorghum and one additional grain sorghum genomes and identified a large numbers of snps , indels , pavs  and cnvs 
 <cit> . however, our detailed analysis revealed that the differentiation in gene functions between the grain  and sweet  sorghum lines might not directly contribute to their phenotypic divergence , which raises the question how the obvious morphological variations between these sorghum lines occurred in a relatively short evolutionary or domesticated period.

accumulated data demonstrated that expression divergence correlated with phenotype variations and manipulations of appropriate gene expression are sufficient for recreating phenotypic differences
 <cit> . expression profiling is one of the most important tools for dissecting biological functions of genes. however, no commercial microarray chips are available for sorghum to analyze the expression profiles. the first sorghum cdna microarray chips were developed to identify differentially expressed genes under various treatments
 <cit>  but were not commercially available. the chips were used for detecting the expression of only  <dig>  unique genes. calviño et al.  identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes between grain and sweet sorghum lines by using an affymetrix sugarcane genechip
 <cit> . however, only conserved sorghum genes could be detectable using the sugarcane chip. to our knowledge, no other microarray-based genome-wide expression analysis has been carried out in sorghum species. in this study, we first designed a sorghum custom microarray chip based on the genome annotation and available expressed sequence tag  datasets. the chip comprises of  <dig>  probes, representing  <dig>  annotated loci and  <dig>  sorghum ests, which have not been mapped on the annotated loci. subsequently we analyzed and compared the transcription profiles between the grain and sweet sorghum lines. such analysis of our data revealed around  <dig>  expressed genes in both lines. these two lines showed difference in their transcriptomes with considerable numbers of variety-specifically or differentially expressed genes and they also exhibited expression difference in response to sucrose treatment.

another raised question is about the molecular basis of expression divergence. similar to other genomes, gene duplication and expansion were also observed in the sorghum genome
 <cit> . expression divergence of duplicated/expanded genes is a subject of great interest to geneticists and evolutionary biologists because it may contribute to the retention and functional divergence of duplicated/expanded genes
 <cit> . meagher  proposed the hypothesis that epitype and associated phenotypes evolved by gene duplication, divergence, and subfunctionalization
 <cit> . to investigate the contribution of gene duplication and expansion to expression divergence, we have identified tandemly or segmentally duplicated as well as expanded sorghum genes by mobile elements in a genome-wide level and subsequently investigated their expression divergence under normal growth conditions and sucrose treatments. our data showed that higher expression divergence was observed in segmentally duplicated genes when compared to the tandemly duplicated genes. these duplicated genes in the grain sorghum experienced higher ratio of expression divergence when compared with those in the sweet sorghum. limited expression divergence was observed for those genes expanded by mobile elements between bt× <dig> and keller.

finally, although expression divergence has been observed in several closely related species
 <cit> , little is known about the mechanisms underlying this divergence. to figure out the mechanisms underlying these expression variations among orthologous or paralogous genes, we further analyzed the regulatory motifs of their promoter regions. our data showed that snps or structural variations  have significantly contributed to the expression divergence. in addition, dna methylation may also play an important role in the species divergence through expression regulation of genes.

RESULTS
phenotypic and genetic variations between the grain and sweet sorghum
both the grain  and sweet  sorghum varieties showed obvious difference in their visible morphological characteristics. for example, at the seedling stage, bt× <dig> grew stronger than keller . keller contained higher percentage of stem sugar content, and its brix degree is around  <dig> %, statistically higher than  <dig> % in bt× <dig> . both varieties also showed the difference in the developmental stage of tracheary elements during xylem formation . the difference was observed by epifluorescence, which was emitted from dead cells. it was obvious that bt× <dig> developed these elements earlier with stronger fluorescence than keller at the similar stage.

since there are obvious phenotypic variations between these two lines, we expect a significant difference in their genotypes. the re-sequencing results revealed up to  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  indels and  <dig>  svs in all annotated gene regions, accounting for 20%, 34% and 27% of total snps, indels and svs, respectively
 <cit> . these variations cover  <dig>  genes for snps,  <dig>  genes for indels and  <dig>  genes for svs. however, most of these variations may not affect functions of these genes. we have detected only  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes suffered from snp, indel and sv, respectively, which may encode truncated proteins due to premature stops in keller genes . we subjected the remaining genes to the ka/ks analysis  and c-value test . we have detected  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes from snp, indel and sv, respectively, with functional divergence . however, for structural variations, up to  <dig> genes were not investigated in their substitution rates since they were from deletion or copy number variation. totally,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes have been detected with functional or protein divergence between bt× <dig> and keller varidue to snp, indel and sv, respectively. some of these genes have been undergone more than one type of variations. for example,  <dig> genes were detected with variations from snp, indel and sv . thus, a total of  <dig>  genes were identified with functional or protein divergence between bt× <dig> and keller. further analysis showed that higher percentage of genes with ka/ks >  <dig>  were annotated with low confidence while a total of  <dig> genes were annotated in this class  in the genome-wide level . furthermore, only 61% and 56% of these genes showed expression in our microarray analysis in bt× <dig> and keller, respectively . among the expressed genes, up to 57% in bt× <dig> and 58% in keller were identified with expression abundance less than  <dig> . all these data suggested that in our analysis some of these genes with functional or protein divergence might have evolved into pseudogenes. therefore, although significant difference in their visible phenotype between grain and sweet sorghum, relatively less divergence was observed in their encoded gene level.

contribution of gene duplication and mobile elements to genome divergence within and between bt× <dig> and keller
re-sequencing results showed that genome-wide duplication in either bt× <dig> or keller might not occur after divergence from the most recent common ancestor  of these two varieties. the data also showed that majority of segmental and tandem duplication as well as transposition of mobile elements occurred in their mrca. to explore the contribution of segmental/tandem duplication and mobile elements to genome divergence within and between these two species , we have genome-widely identified these duplicated genes or mobile element related genes. we have identified  <dig>  segmentally duplicated genes from  <dig>  segmental pairs . we have also identified  <dig>  tandem pairs consisting of  <dig>  tandemly duplicate genes . on the other hand, more than 60% of the sorghum genome was identified to be class i retroelements  or class ii dna transposon  . among the class i retroelements, majority of them is ltr retrotransposon, consisting of  <dig> % of the genome. we have identified total of  <dig>  full-length of ltr retrotransposons and of which only  <dig>  genes were annotated . for the class ii dna transposons, the largest class is the cacta superfamily, accounting for  <dig> % of the genome. we identified a total of  <dig>  full-length cacta elements with  <dig> captured genes . to explore the functional or protein divergence of these genes, we subjected their sequences to ka/ks analysis . generally, majority of these genes  were subjected to purifying selection with ka/ks less than  <dig> either within or between the two varieties. for segmental duplicates, the average ka/ks value was  <dig>  between bt× <dig> and keller while the value was up to  <dig>  within these two genomes . the ka/ks value is  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively for tandem pairs . these data suggested that, after segmental/tandem duplication in their mrca, lower divergence might have occurred between genes and their orthologs. similar result was also observed for cacta- or ltr-related duplicates .

custom microarray analysis revealed variety-specifically or differentially expressed genes between bt× <dig> and keller
we have identified  <dig>  probes with expression signals in bt× <dig>  among them,  <dig>  probes were detected only in sucrose-treated tissue samples,  <dig> only in normal growth conditions and the remaining  <dig>  were expressed in both normal and sucrose-treated tissues . in keller, total of  <dig>  probes were detectable with  <dig>  probes in normal growth conditions,  <dig> in sucrose-treated tissues and  <dig>  in both conditions . based on the agilent earray signal detection system, we have detected  <dig> probes with expression only in bt× <dig> but not in keller and these probes were from  <dig> ests and  <dig> annotated genes, respectively; similarly, we have also detected  <dig>  keller-specific probes including  <dig> from ests and  <dig>  from annotated genes . our data showed that some of genes exhibited significant difference in their expression abundance between bt× <dig> and keller . we have detected total of  <dig> genes with at least twice higher in their expression level in bt× <dig> when compared with keller. in keller, total of  <dig> genes were observed with at least twice higher in their expression signal when compared with bt× <dig>  we classified all expressed genes into  <dig> groups based on their expression level . genes with low abundance  account for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total expressed genes in bt× <dig> and keller, respectively. more than 45% of genes were expressed with middle abundance  and around 30% of genes were with high abundance . only less than 6% of genes exhibited very high expression level . our data showed that similar percentages of genes have been detected between bt× <dig> and keller in each group, which was not statistically different .

to explore why both bt× <dig> and keller show the obvious difference in their brix degree, we carried out the comparative expression analysis under sucrose treatment. in bt× <dig>  only  <dig> down-regulated genes were identified whereas up to  <dig>  genes were detected with up-regulated expression patterns . however, in keller, total of  <dig> genes were down-regulated and only  <dig> genes were regarded as up-regulation in their expression . thus, our data revealed that the number of up-regulated genes in bt× <dig> was at least twice as many as the down-regulated genes; and in keller, contradictory situation was observed, that was, up-regulated genes were only half of the down-regulated genes. for both down- and up-regulated genes, considerable numbers of genes were commonly regulated by sucrose treatment in both the grain and sweet sorghum . besides the commonly down-regulated genes, up to  <dig> genes were down-regulated only in keller and  <dig> genes were only in bt× <dig>  on the contrary, apart from the commonly up-regulated genes, majority of up-regulated genes were detected only in bt× <dig> and only  <dig> up-regulated genes were presented in keller. these data revealed the obvious difference between the grain and sweet sorghum varieties in their sucrose regulation pathways.

among the differentially expressed genes under sucrose treatment, we were interested in those genes encoding transcription factors  or carbohydrate metabolism related genes. among around  <dig>  genes encoding transcription factors, we have identified  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes . they are from different families of tfs and both grain and sweet sorghum showed the difference in the sucrose regulation of tfs. among around  <dig> carbohydrate metabolism related genes, only  <dig> of them were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated . these results showed that most of these genes were not regulated by sucrose treatment although they were involved in sucrose metabolism.

functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between bt× <dig> and keller
we are interested in differentially expressed genes between bt× <dig> and keller. these include bt×623/keller-specific genes , sucrose-regulated genes only in bt×623/keller and genes with at least two times’ higher in bt×623/keller. based on our analysis , total of  <dig>  probes were identified with differential expression between bt× <dig> and keller. among them,  <dig>  genes with annotated loci were selected to investigate their functional divergence . firstly, we analyzed their amino acid sequence variations of these genes and found that total of 47% of differentially expressed genes showed no variation in their encoded protein sequences. the remaining genes were subjected to ka/ks analysis, which revealed that only  <dig> % of these genes exhibited functional or protein divergence with ka/ks >  <dig> . these data indicated that most of the differentially expressed genes between bt× <dig> and keller were under purifying selection with functional constraints.

since genes with either functional/protein  or expression  divergence may contribute to phenotypic variations , we were interested in figuring out the difference in their functional annotation. hence, we investigated gene ontology  terms and identified overrepresented go terms . for each term, we identified go-slim terms in three categories: molecular function , biological process , and cellular component 
 <cit> . our primary motivation was to evaluate whether these genes are biased toward particular functions. our data showed that overrepresented bt×623-specific genes mainly functioned in apoptosis/cell death related biological functions or as helicase  in molecular function. keller-specific genes might play roles in reproductive cellular process and post-embryonic morphogenesis or with monooxygenase activity, heme and tetrapyrrole binding . interestingly, differentially expressed genes with at least twice higher in bt× <dig> also showed functions in apoptosis/cell death related biological processes . however, for the genes with twice higher expression in keller, they showed overrepresented biological functions in multiple go terms . similarly, multiple go terms have been identified with overrepresented biological functions or molecular functions for differentially expressed genes under sucrose treatment . some overlapping go categories have been observed between sucrose regulated genes and these genes with expression only in keller . these categories include reproductive cellular process with item no.  <dig> for biological function and monooxygenase activity, heme and tetrapyrrole binding with no.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for molecular function . in addition, we also analyzed the genes with functional or protein divergence as indicated in figure
1d. similarly, multiple go categories were detected with over-representation in both biological and molecular functions . among them, interestingly, genes with apoptosis/cell death related biological functions  were also detected with over-representation .

promoter variation and expression divergence
to explore why considerable number of genes showed expression divergence, we examined their promoter variations. among the total of  <dig>  annotated genes,  <dig> % of them showed variations in the  <dig>  kb promoter regions upstream of start codon of each gene and the remaining  <dig> % of genes showed no promoter variation between bt× <dig> and keller . among the differentially expressed genes,  <dig> % of them showed promoter variation and  <dig> % of them exhibited no variation in their  <dig>  kb promoter regions . these data indicated that expression divergence was also observed in genes with identical promoter sequences but under different genome background. to explain the observation, we randomly selected  <dig> genes with identical promoter sequence in  <dig>  kb regions but with differential expression abundance between bt× <dig> and keller for dna methylation analysis. our data showed that dna methylation levels and patterns in promoter regions were different between these two varieties. one of the examples lies in the gene with locus name sb02g <dig>  this gene showed significant difference in their expression abundance between bt× <dig> and keller . however, their  <dig>  kb promoter regions showed 100% homology. bisulphate sequencing of these regions showed that they exhibited distinct differences in the percentages of methylation regions. for example, the cytosine at the -783rd bp of the promoter in bt× <dig> was methylated whereas the corresponding locus was not methylated in keller . the result may provide an evidence to explain why the expression abundance in keller was at least  <dig> times higher than that in bt× <dig> 

since up to  <dig> % of promoters showed polymorphism between bt× <dig> and keller, we also investigated how these variations contributed to the expression divergence. all the promoter sequences from differentially expressed genes were achieved from both bt× <dig> and keller genomes and were then submitted to motif searches . over-represented motifs were identified according to their frequency presented in bt× <dig> and keller . for the genes expressed only in bt× <dig>  one of the over-represented motifs is tatabox <dig>  which is critical for accurate transcription initiation. in keller, some of the motifs have been mutated; as a result, no expression was detected. the motif hdzip2atathb <dig> was over-represented in these genes with specific expression patterns or with higher expression level in bt× <dig>  matrix attachment regions  usually resulted in higher expression
 <cit> . over-represented martbox motif may provide an evidence to explain why expression level in bt× <dig> is higher than that in keller in corresponding genes. both motifs sure1stpat <dig> and sure2stpat <dig> are sucrose responsive elements  and they are over-represented in the sucrose-regulated genes only in bt× <dig>  for keller-specific genes, the xylem-specific expression element was over-represented, suggesting that keller might be different from bt× <dig> in xylem development. among the sucrose-regulated genes only in keller, the motif abrezmrab <dig> was over-represented, which functions in aba and water-stress responses. this fact may imply the interaction of sucrose metabolism and abiotic stress signaling.

to further investigate how these variations in promoter motifs affect gene expression patterns, two promoters with difference in their motif structures between bt× <dig> and keller were selected randomly from differentially expressed genes. promoter-gfp cassettes were constructed and were then transferred to sorghum shoots for transient expression. one of the examples is based on the analysis of the gene with locus name sb01g <dig>  this gene showed significant difference in their expression abundance between bt× <dig> and keller by microarray  and quantitative real time reverse transcription pcr  analysis. promoter sequence analysis showed that the motif sef4motifgm7s was absent in bt× <dig> but present in keller . the motif was within an enhancer and has been involved in the regulation of expression abundance
 <cit> . we isolated the sef4motifgm7s-containing promoter from keller. this promoter was mutated at the motif sequence from gttttta to gtttata. both promoters were used to drive gfp expression. the transient expression analysis showed that obviously stronger gfp signal were observed in the shoots where gfp was driven by the sef4motifgm7s-containing promoter . these data suggested that snp-mediated promoter motif modification might result in expression divergence.

gene duplication/expansion and expression divergence within and between bt× <dig> and keller
to explore the molecular basis of gene expression divergence within and between bt× <dig> and keller, we further analyzed the effect of both gene duplication and mobile elements on expression divergence. we first examined the contribution of segmental and tandem duplication events to the expression divergence within bt× <dig> or keller. after segmental duplication, up to 62% of duplicates including 2% of sucrose-related pairs exhibited expression divergence in bt× <dig> whereas only 48% of paralogs showed divergence in keller . for tandem duplication, 48%  in bt× <dig> and 45%  paralogs were detected with expression divergence . therefore, both varieties exhibited significant difference in expression divergence after segmental or tandem duplication . majority of expression divergence was commonly detected in both bt× <dig> and keller . in bt× <dig>  significantly higher percentage of segmentally duplicated genes showed expression divergence; however, in keller, this percentage was reduced . to further confirm the result obtained, genes involved in both segmental and tandem duplications were selected for further analysis. for example, the paralog of the gene sb01g <dig> was supposed to be sb01g <dig> by tandem duplication or sb02g <dig> by segmental duplication . in bt× <dig>  only segmentally duplicated genes showed expression divergence; however, in keller, two pairs of genes from both segmental and tandem duplications showed expression divergence . totally, we have detected  <dig> genes involved in this type of duplication. in bt× <dig>  around 54% of tandemly duplicated pairs showed expression divergence whereas up to 73% of segmentally duplicated genes exhibited expression divergence in keller, indicating the significant difference in their expression divergence . however, in keller, similar percentage of expression divergence was observed between segmental and tandem duplication . a total of  <dig> % of segmentally duplicated pairs showed expression divergence only under sucrose treatment, significantly higher than the percentage  for tandem pairs . although lower expression divergence after segmental or tandem duplication was observed in keller when compared with bt× <dig>  higher percentage of duplicated pairs in keller than in bt× <dig> showed expression divergence only under sucrose treatment. in keller, up to  <dig> % of duplicated pairs showed expression divergence only under sucrose treatment; in contrast, only  <dig> % of pairs were observed in bt× <dig> .

in addition to segmental and tandem duplication, we have also investigated the contribution of both ltr-retrotransposon and cacta elements to expression divergence within bt× <dig> and keller. our data showed that more than 50% of expanded genes by these mobile elements were under expression divergence , similar to the role of segmental/tandem duplication. however, only  <dig> and  <dig> pairs of expanded genes from ltr-retrotransposons and cacta elements, respectively, showed expression divergence under sucrose treatment . the data suggested the low contribution of mobile elements to sucrose related expression divergence either within bt× <dig> or keller.

subsequently, we were interested to analyze the mechanism of gene expression divergence between bt× <dig> and keller. to explore the effect of gene duplication/expansion on expression divergence between these two varieties, we investigated the contribution of segmental/tandem duplication and mobile elements to the expression divergence. we first analyzed the contribution of tandem duplication to the expression divergence. based on our analysis, tandemly duplicated genes accounted for  <dig> % of total annotated sorghum genes. analogically,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total annotated sorghum genes were identified to be related to segmental duplication, ltr-retrotransposon and cacta element mediated gene expansion, respectively . among total divergent  <dig> genes with expression only in bt× <dig> ,  <dig> % of them were evolved from tandem duplication ; the ratio is significantly higher  than the percentage of tandem duplicates among total annotated genes . similarly, over-represented tandem genes were also observed in these genes with higher two times in bt× <dig> , higher two times in keller , regulation by sucrose only in bt× <dig> , regulation by sucrose only in keller , respectively . for the genes expressed only in keller or with snp stop codon or with ka/ks > <dig>  no significant difference was observed when compared with the control . subsequently, we examined the contribution of segmental duplication. we detected up to  <dig> % genes regulated by sucrose only in bt× <dig> were involved in segmental duplication, statistically higher  than the percentage  of segmental duplicates among total annotated genes. overly-represented segmental genes  were also observed in the genes regulated by sucrose only in keller . for the remaining types of differentially expressed genes, no significantly higher percentage of segmental genes was observed in our analysis. for ltr-retrotransposon related genes, over-represented genes were detected in these genes with expression only in keller  and with snp stop codon or ka/ks >  <dig>  . however, for the cacta-related genes, no significant difference was observed to contribute to differential expression between bt× <dig> and keller . thus, our data suggested that both tandem and segmental duplication could have significantly contributed to gene expression divergence between bt× <dig> and keller. recently, hollister et al.,  reported that transposable elements significantly contributed to expression divergence between arabidopsis thaliana and arabidopsis lyrata <cit> . thus, molecular and evolution basis of gene expression divergence in sorghum and arabidopsis might be different.

discussion
expression divergence was genetically determined by functionally divergent genes between bt× <dig> and keller
genes with genetic variations might lead to pseudogenes without any selection pressure and then lose their functions. in contract, genes with sequence variations might evolve into new biological functions or expression patterns under certain selection pressures . although large numbers of sequence variations have been detected, we have only detected  <dig>  genes with functional or protein divergence between these bt× <dig> and keller . around 40% of them showed no expression in either bt× <dig> or keller and some of them should have been evolved into pseudogenes and others might be tissue-specific or stress-induced. although functionally divergent genes between these two lines are limited, they might have played important roles in the divergence between these two varieties . based on the over-represented genes involved in “biological process” in the gene ontology analysis, these genes might mainly be involved in programmed cell death and anatomical structure homeostasis . the analysis may imply that these genes function in anatomical divergence at the seedling stage. one of the observed differences between bt× <dig> and keller is the developmental stage of tracheary elements during xylem formation . bt× <dig> generally develops tracheary elements earlier than keller. the development of tracheary elements are directly related to programmed cell death
 <cit> . thus, functionally divergent genes might contribute to the phenotypic divergence in xylem formation. another over-represented biological function of divergent genes is involved in dna metabolic process. this biological process is important for dna methylation. in fact, among the functionally divergent genes, we have detected many genes directly related to dna methylation, including these genes encoding various methyltransferases, helicases, histone deacetylases and histidine kinases and so on. these facts may imply the difference in dna methylation between these two varieties, which were confirmed by our experiments . the difference in return regulates expression divergence between these two lines . therefore, it is the genotypic divergence that leads to expression divergence.

among  <dig> annotated genes with differential expression between these two lines , majority of them showed no functional divergence based on ka/ks analysis . they were classified into  <dig> types of differentially expressed genes . interestingly, over-represented genes with expression only in bt× <dig> or with two times higher of expression level in bt× <dig> showed similar gene ontology: programmed cell death . this result might imply that not only genome variation but also expression divergence contribute to the difference in development of tracheary elements. among differentially expressed genes with two times higher in bt× <dig>  genes were much more enriched in their functions related to flavonoid biosynthesis . in sorghum and other plants, flavonoids play important roles in disease resistance
 <cit> . both bt× <dig> and keller showed obvious difference in disease resistance. for example, anthracnose is one of the main diseases in sorghum. keller is resistant to the disease
 <cit>  but bt× <dig> is susceptible
 <cit> . the disease is flavonoid phytoalexin-dependent
 <cit> . among a total of  <dig>  annotated genes, liu et al.  identified  <dig> favonoid structural genes encoding flavanone 3-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase or anthocyanidin synthase
 <cit> . four of them, sb03g <dig>  sb04g <dig>  sb06g <dig> and sb09g <dig>  showed at least two times higher in their expression abundance in keller than in bt× <dig>  the result may provide an evidence to explain why keller showed improved resistance to anthracnose. thus, our data suggest that genes with two times higher in keller might play a role in the divergence of disease resistance between bt× <dig> and keller . on the other hand, over-represented molecular and biological functions of genes regulated by sucrose only in bt× <dig> are involved in multiple biological and metabolic processes . further study should be carried out to understand their roles in species divergence.

the remaining two sets of differentially expressed genes are those expressed only in keller and regulated by sucrose only in keller. over-represented molecular functions of genes expressed only in keller are monooxygenase activity, heme binding and tetrapyrrole binding , which are required for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. the biosynthesis pathway supplies important molecules for photosynthesis
 <cit> . thus, these two sets of genes mainly function in photosynthesis and hormone metabolism . more genes have been involved in this process in keller than in bt× <dig>  suggesting the differentiation of photosynthesis system between these two varieties. this result might provide an evidence to explain more sugar accumulation in sweet sorghum. however, differentiation of sugar accumulation between sweet and grain sorghum lines is complex and more components might have been involved in this process. recently, calvino et al.  carried out the transcriptome characterization of small rna component in the grain  and sweet  sorghum stems
 <cit> . their data revealed that expression divergence of known mirnas between bt× <dig> and rio correlated with sugar content in their f <dig> population, suggesting a potential role of microrna in stem sugar accumulation. the genes involved in sugar accumulated are not well characterized in sorghum due to the low heritability of the trait and its quantitative inheritance
 <cit> . our comparative analysis from re-sequencing data showed that genes with functionally divergent genes between bt× <dig> and keller might not be directly involved in sugar accumulation. interestingly, screening of sorghum genes linked to high sugar content indicated that 80% of differentially expressed genes between sweet and grain sorghum had their orthologs in rice suggesting limited contribution of their gene content for differentiating sorghum sugar accumulation
 <cit> . thus, our data and others
 <cit>  suggested that expression divergence should play important roles in the divergence of sugar accumulation between sweet and grain sorghum lines. in fact, changes of gene expression in eukaryotes often give rise to new phenotypes and the changes were frequently used as a proxy indicator of functional divergence of genes
 <cit> .

molecular basis and mechanisms of genome variations and expression divergence between bt× <dig> and keller
due to very limited genes with functional or protein divergence but with obvious phenotypic diversity between bt× <dig> and keller, they provide an excellent and comparable materials to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype. our re-sequencing data showed that majority of tandem and segmental duplications as well as transposition events of mobile elements occurred beyond the divergence between bt× <dig> and keller. for duplication related gene expansion, we have analyzed both segmental and tandem duplications since both bt× <dig> and keller showed similar whole genome duplication events. for transposition related gene expansion, we investigated only both ltr retrotransposons and cacta super family since these two classes account for majority of mobile elements in sorghum
 <cit> . we have investigated functional divergence of coding regions of expanded genes. our data showed that less than 10% of expanded genes had evolved into new functions within a species  or between bt× <dig> and keller. we were wondering how these expanded genes could survive with only 10% of functional divergence. subsequently, we investigated the expression divergence among these expanded genes. interestingly, our results showed that around 50% of expanded genes showed expression divergence within bt× <dig> or keller , suggesting that their expression divergence is a major mechanism to drive the retention of expanded genes by segmental/tandem duplication or transposition by mobile elements. on the other hand, among total of differentially expressed genes, tandem or segmentally duplicated genes were over-represented . this data suggested that expression divergence of expanded genes also significantly contributed to the divergence of two sorghum lines. due to the significant contribution of expression divergence to phenotypic variation, we further analyzed the mechanism how these expanded genes were retained by expression divergence. reasonably, our data showed that motif variations of promoter regions contributed to expression divergence . however, our data showed that expression divergence was also observed in genes with same promoter sequence. in this case, dna methylation has been proven to play important roles in expression divergence between bt× <dig> and keller. in fact, dna methylation has been observed in sorghum and played a role in tissue-specific expression
 <cit> . our work demonstrated that differential dna methylation might play a role in expression divergence not only within a genotype but also between closely related two genotypes. since we analyzed expression patterns with only several samples under limited stress conditions, more expression divergence should be revealed within bt× <dig> / keller or between these two varieties. thus, higher expression divergence should be detected. however, thus an expression divergence is genetically determined by the divergence in genome level.

substantial differences in gene expression patterns have been observed between closely related species
 <cit> . mechanisms underlying these differences have not yet fully understood. generally, gene expression is regulated by various transcription factors. however, sequence divergence at transcription factor-binding sites accounts for only a small fraction of observed expression differences
 <cit> . our data also showed the limited expression divergence in genes encoding various transcription factors between bt× <dig> and keller . studies also suggested that chromatin regulators have a key role in generating expression diversity
 <cit> . however, majority of the studies on gene expression divergence were carried out using closely related species , little is known about the expression divergence within intra-species. does a similar mechanism control the expression divergence? interestingly, our data demonstrated that dna methylation play important roles in gene expression divergence within intra-species , indicating a similar mechanism to control the expression divergence within intra-species.

another interesting issue is how the expression divergence leads to differential sugar accumulation between grain and sweet sorghum. comparative expression analyses have been carried out in multiple species to investigate the differentially expressed genes under certain stress conditions between a pair of genotypes with obvious difference in a specific phenotypic trait. for example, between drought tolerant and sensitive rice cultivars, more drought up-regulated genes were detected in the sensitive than in the tolerant cultivars
 <cit> . more salinity up-regulated genes were also identified in the salinity sensitive lines than in the tolerant lines
 <cit> . our data show a similar trend. more up-regulated genes by sucrose treatment in bt× <dig> were detected than that in keller . based on the above mentioned data, we propose the hypothesis that higher sugar accumulation in keller might be due to constitutive over-expression of these genes that function in sugar accumulation and were up-regulated in bt× <dig> 

duplication and transposition and cultivar domestication
sweet and grain sorghum lines have originated from the same subspecies and the former is a natural variant of the latter
 <cit> . how sweet sorghum differs genetically from grain sorghum is not well characterized
 <cit> . modern sweet sorghum cultivars were developed from naturally variant sweet sorghum by sexual crossing and subsequent selection. what is the mechanism beyond the breeding selection? plant genomes contain higher percentage of duplicated genes when compared with most of other eukaryotes
 <cit> . segmental, tandem duplications and transpositions by mobile elements have significantly contributed to such an event
 <cit> . both duplication and transposition provided basis for genetic variation. expanded genes might give birth to new genes with divergent functions for better adaptability, competition for species existence. on the other hand, duplicate genes in arabidopsis also exhibited higher percentages of expression divergence between or within species
 <cit> . similar results were observed in sorghum in this study. during artificial domestication of sweet sorghum, genetic variation was pyramided to contribute to the higher content of sugar accumulation by breeding program. previous studies showed that tandem duplication played a role in the adaptive response to environmental stimuli
 <cit> . our data showed that tandem/segmental duplication played a role in the divergence of certain specific traits such as photosynthesis and disease resistance. as a result, tandem/segmental duplication might contribute to intra-species divergence and cultivar domestication under natural variation and artificial selection.

CONCLUSIONS
the application of “next-generation sequencing” technique has greatly increased the speed and output of sequencing works with reduced costs. how to explain the phenotypic difference among closely related species is becoming more and more interesting since their genome sequencing data are more easily available. our data showed that although both grain and sweet sorghum genomes exhibited considerable differences in their genome sequences, only limited divergence occurred in their functional genes. thus, majority of phenotypic differences between these two varieties might not be directly due to the divergence of these functional genes. however, we have detected more than  <dig>  differentially expressed genes between these two varieties. such expression divergence was resulted from mutations in expression regulatory sequences and dna methylation, which was genetically determined by functionally divergent genes between these two genomes. further investigation showed that both tandem and segmental duplication played important roles in the genome evolution and expression divergence. recently, hollister et al.  reported the contribution of transposable elements to gene expression divergence between arabidopsis thaliana and arabidopsis lyrata <cit> . however, in sorghum, limited contribution of mobile elements to expression divergence has been observed, suggesting the difference in expression regulation between arabidopsis and sorghum.
