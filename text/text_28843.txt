BACKGROUND
low temperature is an environmental abiotic stimulus. to adapt to environmental changes, plants have various physiological response and defense systems to withstand chilling and freezing conditions. the regulatory mechanism in higher plants had been analyzed by studying a number of genes responding to cold stress at the transcriptional level  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, for example, thousands of genes were thought to be involved in abiotic stress  <cit> . generally, the cold stress-inducible genes were classified into two groups: one group was that directly protect plant against environmental stresses; and the other was that regulate gene expression network and signaling in stress response  <cit> . recent progress had been made in analyzing the functions of stress-inducible genes, not only to understand the mechanisms of cold stress, but also to improve the chilling tolerance of plants by gene transfer. genetic studies had identified many transcription factors that extensively involved in the regulation network of cold-inducible genes  <cit> . the most well documented pathways involved a class of dreb/cbf transcription factors, which specific binding to the dre/crt cis-elements in the promoters of the target genes  <cit> . in a. thaliana, recent studies also focused on the upstream regulators of dreb/cbf. several proteins, including ice <dig>  myb <dig> and camta <dig>  had been identified as regulators of dreb1/cbf gene expression  <cit> .

genome-wide analyses have dramatically improved the efficiency of gene discovery. with the advent of next-generation sequencing, large scale transcriptome data became available in both model species and non-model species  <cit> . although microarray technologies continue to make progress, genome-scale studies have been actively pursued for gene discovery and construction of biochemical and regulatory networks  <cit> . using the transcriptome data for reference, dge tag profiling generates a digital output proportional, allowing digital quantification and comparation across different experiments. a number of studies have used high-throughput expression analyses by stress conditions in higher plants. in a. thaliana, about 30% of the transcriptome was regulated by abiotic stress, and  <dig>  genes were identified of great importance to cold, salt, and drought tolerance  <cit> . in wheat, the effect of low temperature on transcriptome reprogramming was explored, and over 2% of the wheat genome showed a greater than two-fold changes by cold stress  <cit> . in roots of cucumber, large-scale differentially expressed genes in several regulatory pathways were identified under waterlogging stress by digital gene expression profile  <cit> . although transcriptome changes have been identified, the biochemical functions of many stress-regulated genes remain unknown.

anthurium andraeanum is one of the most popular tropical flowers in markets worldwide. unlike the freeze-tolerant a. thaliana, anthurium plants are irreversibly injured by long-term exposure to temperatures lower than 6°c. in temperate and cold areas, a much greater risk of cold stress occurs in the supply of anthurium plants, especially in the process of production and transportation. after duration of long-time cold exposure, anthurium plants cease to grow, and wilting symptoms begin to appear, with visible signs of yellowing leaves. it has been demonstrated that the physiological changes of cold response is mediated through the differential expression of many genes in model plants  <cit> . however, little is known about the cold-regulated genes and related pathways in anthurium. to date, no previous genomic information has been reported in anthurium plants, and fewer than  <dig> ests have previously been deposited in genbank.

in this study, we presented the first comprehensive transcriptome characterization for anthurium plants, and explored the effect of low temperature on global changes in the transcriptome. using illumina sequencing technology, we generated over two billion base of high-quality sequence, and demonstrated de novo assembly and annotation of genes without prior genome information. furthermore, we compared the gene expression profiles of cold-treated and control anthurium plants using dge system, and identified numerous differentially and specifically expressed transcripts of cold-regulated genes. this represents a fully characterized anthurium transcriptome, and provides a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies of abiotic stress in the future.

RESULTS
sequencing and reads assembly
to obtain a global overview of anthurium transcriptome, a mixed cdna sample of seedlings of cold-treated and control plants was prepared and sequenced using illumina hiseq™  <dig>  sequencing of normalized cdna libraries resulted in approximately  <dig> gbp of sequence data. after the first assembly,  <dig>  contigs were obtained, and the mean contig size was 138 bp with lengths. then the contigs were further assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds with paired-end reads joining. the size distribution of contigs and scaffolds are shown in additional file  <dig>  after gap fillings of scaffolds, the final assembly consisted of  <dig>  unigenes . the length distributions of unigenes are given in figure  <dig> table  <dig>

the unigene sequences were firstly compared to the non-redundant  protein database with a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  as a result,  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated. figure  <dig> indicated that the ratio of unigenes that could be matched to known genes had a linear relationship with the length of unigene sequences. as shown in the figure, 98% unigenes over  <dig>  bp were annotated with gene names, whereas 46% sequences between  <dig> to 500 bp could be matched to known proteins . for e-value distribution, 61% homolog sequences ranged between  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  while 39% sequences had a threshold e-value less than  <dig> e- <dig> that showed strong homology . the species that provided the best blastx matches  was oryza sativa, and there were more than ten thousand genes with the highest homology. the next closest species was a. thaliana, which showed 21% homology with anthurium andraeanum .figure  <dig>

we used gene ontology  to classify functions of the annotated genes. using blast2go suite,  <dig>  sequences  were categorized to three different go trees . the three main categories were further classified to  <dig> functional groups. seven groups, ‘cellular process’, ‘metabolic process’, ‘cell’, ‘cell part’, ‘organelle’, ‘binding’ and ‘catalytic’ are dominant clusters in go classification . we further performed phylogenetic classification using clusters of orthologous groups  database. in total,  <dig>  genes were matched, and they were grouped into  <dig> functional classes. the cluster for ‘general function prediction only’  and ‘transcription’  were the two largest groups in percentage, which represent 13% and 10% respectively . to make further understanding of the transcriptome data, we carried out pathway analysis with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  mapping of the anthurium andraeanum transcriptome. totally  <dig>  sequences were identified with pathway annotation, and they were functionally assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the ‘metabolic pathways’ contributed to the greatest parts , followed by ‘spliceosome’  and ‘plant-pathogen interaction’  .table  <dig>

digital gene expression  library sequencing
to generate digital expression signatures for anthurium plants under low temperature, we used solexa  technology for sequencing. briefly, using dge technology, we sequenced six libraries: control plant samples before transferred from  <dig> to 6°c , and cold-treated samples at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  24 h under 6°c after transfer. to facilitate our analysis, three cold-treated samples  were selected for comparation with control plants in the following analysis. in total, the dge libraries generated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million raw reads. after removing low quality reads, total number of clean tags per library ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million, and number of clean tags entitles with unique nucleotide sequences ranged from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> . to evaluate the normality of the dge data, we performed analysis of the distribution of tag expression. as shown in figure  <dig>  the distribution of total tags and distinct clean tags over different tag-abundance categories displayed similar patterns for all four dge libraries. small number categories of mrna had high abundance, while the rest majority stays at a very low level of expression.table  <dig>

mapping dge sequences to the reference transcriptome database
to reveal the molecular events of the dge profiles, application of the transcriptome data was convened into further study of its digital gene expression signatures under low temperature in anthurium plants. we mapped the tag sequences of the four dge libraries to our transcriptome reference database. the reference database contained  <dig>  unigenes. among the generated distinct tags,  <dig>  to  <dig>  distinct tags were mapped to a gene in the reference transcriptome database. over 40% sequences in the reference tag database could be mapped to a unique tag . the saturation analysis was performed to check whether the number of detected genes increased proportionally to the sequence amount. additional file  <dig> showed the trend of saturation, and the number of detected genes almost ceased to increase when sequencing amount reached  <dig> million or higher. the gene expression level was determined by number concentrations using tpm . the normalized final counts were measured. as summarized in additional file  <dig>  only a small number of genes were highly expressed, most of the genes had fewer than  <dig> copies.

analysis of differential gene expression
a total of  <dig>  significantly changed genes were detected between cold-treated and control libraries. we found that over 50% of the differentially expressed genes had no homologues in the ncbi database. screening of differentially expressed genes, the results showed that both up- and down-regulation of gene expression occur, but that, the expression of genes changed over time of cold treatments. among all differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were quickly induced by cold while  <dig>  were down-regulated at 1 h . after 5-h cold treatment,  <dig> genes were up-regulated, and  <dig>  were down-regulated . after 24-h cold stress treatment,  <dig> genes were up-regulated, and  <dig>  were down-regulated .figure  <dig>

metabolic pathway by kegg analysis of cold up-regulated genes
in this study, we concentrated on up-regulated genes by cold stress, and genes with expression ratios greater than  <dig> times compared with unstressed plants were defined as cold-inducible genes. to understand the biological function of these genes, we mapped the cold-induced genes to terms in kegg database, with a view to identifies significantly enriched metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways in degs comparing with the whole genome background. among the mapped pathways, six pathway were significantly enriched  after the 1-h cold treatment. notably, specific enrichment was observed in photosynthesis pathway, metabolic pathways and oxidative phosphorylation pathway in 1-h cold-treated plants. after a 5-h cold treatment, the metabolic pathways and oxidative phosphorylation pathway were significantly identified as the top two pathways. after 24-h cold treatment, we found that transcripts involved in mrna surveillance pathway, rna transport pathway and plant-pathogen interaction pathway were significantly enriched .table  <dig>

analysis of cold up-regulated genes identified as putative transcription factors
given that transcription factors appear to have a major effect on the network of cold-responsive genes, an objective of our work was to identify cold-inducible transcription factors. together, a total of  <dig> up-regulated genes encode known or putative transcription factors. as shown in table  <dig>  twelve genes were characterized as ap2/erf family transcription factors, constituting a large proportion of cold-inducible transcription factors. among these genes, three dehydration-responsive element binding proteins  were found to be significantly induced by cold stress in anthurium. a subset of zinc figure family members, including wrky subfamily, were involved in responses to cold stimuli. next, relative small group of nac, myb and bzip transcription factors family members was characterized as cold-inducible transcription factors . to further evaluate the role of these transcription factors, we analyzed the expression level of certain transcription factors by calculating the number of unambiguous clean tags and then normalizing to tpm . as shown in figure  <dig>  these transcription factor genes were significantly up-regulated by cold stress. however, the induction model varied among transcription factor genes. for example, the expression of ap2/erf <dig> and znf <dig> was induced shortly after starting cold treatment, and the expression increased gradually over the treatment time. ap2/erf <dig> and znf <dig> had an expression peak at 1 h, and then the expressions decreased quickly to a relative low level.table  <dig>

discussion
evaluation of de novo transcriptome assembly quality
despite the great advances in dna sequencing technologies, no genomic data is available to date for anthurium plants. with the development of rna-seq, transcriptome analysis has become an attractive alternative for in-depth analysis at high resolution. in this study, we carried out de novo transcriptome assembly using short-read  sequencing. to date, there are many studies using the roche  <dig> gs platform  <cit> , which has relative longer reads but at the expense of less sequence data per run. however, the illumina generates greater depth of sequencing, ensuring more complete coverage of the transcriptome comparing with  <dig> gs platform. in this study, despite using shorter reads, our assembly is comparable to other published transcriptomes using  <dig> gs platform. as shown in figure  <dig>  more than13% unigenes were greater than 1 kb, and 34% unigenes were greater than 500 bp. these results demonstrated the effectiveness of the assembly in capturing a large portion of the transcriptome. another useful metric is the proportion of the unigenes and its corresponding blast hit. due to lack of genomic resources for anthurium, the proportions of unigenes that have significant similarity to known proteins in genbank were considered as ‘gold standard’ reference in our studies. nearly  <dig> % of our unigenes had matches in nr protein database, and this value was as high as other comparable statistics reported in de novo assemblies.

analysis of differentially expressed genes
it has long been known that extensive changes of gene expression occur when plants are exposed to cold stress  <cit> . generally, both up- and down-regulation of gene expression occur under cold conditions. it was reported that more genes were up-regulated than down-regulated under cold stress in model plants  <cit> . in a. thaliana, it was reported that  <dig> genes were found to be cold responsive, and  <dig>  decreased in abundance  <cit> . in wheat, over 2% of the whole genome showed altered levels of expression in response to cold stress. among these genes,  <dig>  genes were induced by a cold shock, and  <dig>  were down-regulated  <cit> . in this study,  <dig>  differently expressed genes were identified in anthurium, and the relative genomic proportion devoted to cold stress is unknown due to the lack of genome resources. about 30% genes were found to be cold inducible, more than 70% decreased in abundance. these results suggested that plants responses vary in their abilities to adapt to cold stress. gene expression in tropical plants might extensively differ from that in freeze-tolerant model plants conferring their response to cold stimuli. among the differentially expressed genes regulated by cold stress in anthurium, over 50% of them had no homologues in the ncbi database. some of these genes might represent new cold-responsible transcripts which have not been reported in model plants.

photosystems
photosynthesis is highly sensitive to changing temperatures. in barley, it has been reported that light and photosynthetic activity play an important role in plant frost resistance under cold conditions  <cit> . in meadow fescue, about 50% of the differentially changed proteins were involved in photosynthesis during cold conditions  <cit> . in this study, to understand the biological function of the genes in anthurium, we mapped the differentially expressed genes to terms in kegg database. the result showed that photosynthesis pathway was significantly enriched after 1-h cold treatment, suggesting a role in early response to low temperature. detailed information of photosynthesis pathway in kegg database indicated that photosystems i and ii  were rapidly influenced by cold stress . the electrons from psi and psii might transfer to oxygen, and thereby leads to substantial generation of reactive oxygen species. enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation pathway after 1-h cold treatment suggested that light-induced ros production might occur. however, this hypothesis still lack of experimental evidence.

major transcription factors of cold stress response
plants have evolved physiological and biochemical ways in order to cope with cold stress. these responses require expression of large-scale cold-responsive genes. in model plants, transcription factors have been described to control the network of many target genes through direct binding to cis-elements of gene promoter regions . in anthurium,  <dig> up-regulated genes were identified as putative transcription factors, including ap2/erf, zn-finger, wrky, nac, myb, bzip families. these transcription factors exhibited different induction patterns over time periods . based on our results of anthurium plants, the ‘early rapid response’  to cold stress might occurred within the initial 1 hour, while the ‘early slow response’  occurred between  <dig> and 5 hours. majority of cold up-regulated transcription factors were activated at phase- <dig> and phase- <dig>  and the transcription factors activated at phase- <dig> might play a key role in the activation of the coordinated expression of down-stream genes. fewer transcription factors exhibited ‘late response’ profiles  until 24 hours, and these transcription factors were likely controlled by phase- <dig> transcription factors.

one group of the most studied transcription factors involved in cold responses is the ap2/erf family transcription factors, which includes four major subfamilies: the ap <dig>  erf, rav and dehydration-responsive element-binding protein  subfamilies  <cit> . of these, the dreb subfamily has been described as major factors involved in plant cold-stress responses  <cit> . the role of drebs/cbfs has been well established in numerous plants, such as a. thaliana <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . the dreb1s/cbfs expression levels were positively correlated with cold tolerance and it activate the expression of downstream cold-responsive genes via specific binding to the dre/crt cis-acting element in their promoters  <cit> . in anthurium, three dreb genes were found to be quickly and significantly induced by cold stress. the well-established dreb1/cbf pathway might functionally act in anthurium plants.

although the dreb1/cbf regulon appeared to be one of the main regulatory pathways involved in cold stress, and multiple low-temperature regulatory pathways in addition to the dreb1/cbf pathway were also studied. in a. thaliana, transcriptome-profiling indicated at least 28% of the cold-responsive genes were independent of the cbf cold response pathway, including at least  <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . in wheat, at least one-third of the cold-inducible genes were not responsive to cbf regulation  <cit> . discovery of novel regulators and regulons by cold stress has always been a continuing story. recently, several zinc-figure transcription factors were discovered to be novel regulators in a. thaliana and rice  <cit> . a novel mybs <dig> transcription factor was identified in rice, and it could repress the well-known dreb1/cbf dependent signaling pathway  <cit> . in anthurium plants, many transcription factors in addition to ap2/erf family were actively induced by cold stress. notably, zinc-figure proteins constitute the largest cold-inducible transcription factor family within the initial 1 hour in anthurium . early activation of these transcription factors implied that certain zinc-figure proteins might acts in parallel to the dreb /cbf pathway. certain regulatory mechanisms might exist involving these transcription factors and their regulons in cold stress. further investigation should focus on the role of these transcription factors and the related pathways under abiotic stress.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used high-throughput sequencing data to characterize the transcriptome of anthurium, a species for which little genomic data are available. further, dge tags were mapped to the assembled transcriptome for further gene expression analysis. a large number of candidate genes involved in cold stress were identified. this represents a fully characterized transcriptome, and provides a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies in anthurium plants. additionally, dge profiling provides new leads for functionally studies of genes involved in abiotic stress.
