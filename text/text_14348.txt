BACKGROUND
brucellosis is a widespread zoonosis of great economic importance caused by facultative intracellular gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus brucella. although brucellosis in domestic animals has been eradicated in great number of european countries, the risk of reintroduction of the disease still exists through spill-over from wildlife that are considered to be natural reservoirs  <cit> . a study on the surveillance of different swine pathogens demonstrated the presence of brucella suis biovar  <dig> in a population of wild boars in switzerland  <cit> .

reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools play a crucial role in the control of brucellosis in livestock, wildlife and humans. although blood and tissue cultures remain the 'gold standard' for diagnosis, they show low sensitivity, are time consuming, and represent a risk for laboratory personnel  <cit> .

serology is a standard method for the epidemiological surveillance of brucellosis  <cit> . however, cross-reactions between brucella species and other gram-negative bacteria, such as yersinia enterocolitica o: <dig>  francisella tularensis, escherichia coli o: <dig>  salmonella urbana group n, vibrio cholerae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, are a major problem of the serological assays  <cit> . the source of antigenic cross-reactions is the o-chain of the smooth lipopolysaccharide  present on the surface of the bacterial cell, which shows great similarity in smooth brucella spp. and the abovementioned bacteria  <cit> . false-positive serological results due only to y. enterocolitica o: <dig> affect up to 15% of the cattle herds in regions free from brucellosis, generating considerable additional costs for surveillance programs  <cit> . false-negative results have also been observed in serological diagnosis of brucellosis  <cit> . they occur mostly due to the fact that the antibody response is dependent upon the stage of infection during sample collection  <cit> . for example, leal-klevezas and colleagues stated that detectable amounts of antibodies are not recorded in the first 12â€“ <dig> days after artificial inoculation of goats with brucella abortus  <cit> . on the other hand, when the disease becomes chronic, the antibody titre could fall to undetectable levels  <cit> , which is especially the case with intracellular organisms like brucella spp.  <cit> . latent infection without seroconversion further complicates the problem, particularly in pre-pubertal animals  <cit> .

molecular diagnostic techniques represent an important breakthrough in the diagnostic practice. a number of genus- or species-specific conventional pcr assays using primers derived from different gene sequences from the brucella genome, such as 16s rrna  <cit> , the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region  <cit> , omp <dig>  <cit>  and bcsp <dig>  <cit> , have been established. these assays were adapted for application to brucella detection in different clinical specimens. in the majority of studies, conventional pcr proved to be a good means to detect brucella dna from clinical specimens  <cit> , while romero and colleagues found that pcr had lower sensitivity compared to the conventional detection methods  <cit> .

the introduction of real-time pcr offers improved sensitivity, specificity and speed of performance compared with conventional pcr. several real-time pcr assays using different detection chemistries have already been established for brucella identification  <cit> . moreover, some of them were evaluated with various clinical samples of human and animal origins  <cit> . most of the authors confirmed that real-time pcr was a very sensitive method of detection from clinical samples  <cit> ; nevertheless, o'leary and colleagues found that there was no advantage in using real-time pcr on blood, milk and lymph node samples of naturally infected cows over standard serological and bacteriological methods  <cit> .

the goal of our present study was to evaluate the performance of a recently described real-time pcr assay  <cit>  for brucella spp. detection with wild boar blood and tissue samples collected under the wild boar surveillance program in switzerland. this assay is based on the brucella spp. specific multiple is <dig> insertion sequence and therefore shows great sensitivity  <cit> . the same samples were additionally tested by bacterial isolation and three serological tests , and the results obtained were compared to those of the real-time pcr.

RESULTS
bacteriological isolation
there were no differences in the results obtained with bacteriological isolation before and after freezing of the tissue samples. brucella was isolated from tissue samples of  <dig>  out of  <dig> animals . according to the bacterial isolation method, the highest prevalence was found in tissues of reproductive organs . brucella was also isolated from one spleen and one lung sample. all brucella strains were identified as b. suis biovar  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the detection of brucella spp. in individual tissue samples by bacterial isolation and is <dig> real-time pcr. in three animals, bacterial colonies with morphological characteristics similar to brucella spp. were isolated. their lysates tested negative with the is <dig> real-time pcr assay and were subsequently submitted for 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the sequence showed 99% identity with bisgaard taxon  <dig> .

no brucella bacteria could be isolated from blood samples.

serological testing
sera from  <dig> animals were tested with  <dig> different serological methods. rbt showed the highest sensitivity, detecting  <dig>  positive samples while results could not be obtained for  <dig>  samples due to strong haemolysis. with the c-elisa,  <dig>  samples tested positive. i-elisa detected  <dig>  positive samples, while  <dig>  samples showed equivocal results. table  <dig> summarises the results of the different methods used for testing the blood samples. only  <dig>  samples were found positive with all  <dig> serological tests. figure  <dig> and table  <dig> show the comparative analysis of positive samples detected with both serology and is <dig> real-time pcr.

a the results could not be obtained for four samples tested with rbt due to strong haemolysis, and for nine samples tested with is <dig> real-time pcr because of inhibition caused by their poor quality

testing of tissue samples with is <dig> real-time pcr
the signal for 18s rrna gene  was detected for all samples. by testing tissue samples originating from  <dig> wild boars, all  <dig> positive  animals detected by bacterial isolation were also detected by is <dig> real-time pcr. furthermore, with the is <dig> real-time pcr, we were able to additionally detect nine  infected animals that were negative by the bacterial isolation method. interestingly, in  <dig> out of  <dig> positive animals, is <dig> real-time pcr was able to detect brucella-specific dna in every organ that was available for examination. table  <dig> shows the number of positive animals detected by bacterial isolation and is <dig> real-time pcr. table  <dig> shows the detection of brucella spp. in individual tissue samples by bacterial isolation and is <dig> real-time pcr. the quantification of bacteria per host cell in various organs revealed that of the  <dig> real-time pcr positive animals,  <dig> of them had the largest quantities of brucella dna in sexual organs , ranging up to  <dig> is <dig> copies pro  <dig> cells. in two animals the spleen was principally affected , whereas in only one animal the largest brucella dna quantity was found in urine .

testing of blood samples with is <dig> real-time pcr
as already mentioned, only leukocyte pellets were used for dna extraction from blood samples. in  <dig> out of  <dig>  samples, results were not obtained with the real-time pcr due to inhibition caused by the poor quality of the given blood samples. the signal for 18s rrna gene  was detected for all samples, except the nine aforementioned samples that were inhibited. out of  <dig> blood samples,  <dig>  tested positive with the is <dig> real-time pcr. surprisingly, is <dig> real-time pcr detected infection in  <dig> %  of wild boars that were serologically negative. table  <dig> summarises the results of the different methods used for testing blood samples.

discussion
in this study, we report the performance of the recently described real-time pcr assay for the detection of brucella spp.  <cit>  in blood and tissue samples from naturally infected wild boars. results obtained were compared with the results of bacterial isolation and three different serological tests for detection of brucellosis: rbt, i-elisa and c-elisa. this real-time pcr assay is very appealing as a diagnostic tool because it targets the is <dig> insertion element, which is present in multiple copies in brucella genomes and at the same time represents a stable genetic element with respect to number and positions in the genomes of various brucella species  <cit> . the is <dig> real-time pcr assay has been shown to be specific for brucella spp. with a detection limit of  <dig> copies, indicating high assay sensitivity  <cit> .

regarding brucella spp. detection in wild boar tissue samples, the is <dig> assay was able to additionally detect brucella dna in tissues of  <dig>  animals that were negative by bacterial isolation . this low sensitivity of the culture method has already been reported by different authors  <cit> . the significantly higher detection sensitivity of real-time pcr can be explained by the fact that it detects dna from bacteria that are damaged and nonviable and therefore impossible to isolate by conventional cultures. in  <dig> out of  <dig> real-time pcr positive animals, the is <dig> real-time pcr assay was able to detect brucella dna from almost every organ that was submitted for examination . the quantification of bacteria per host cell in various organs revealed that in  <dig> of the real-time pcr positive animals, the largest quantities of brucella dna were found in sexual organs, in two animals the spleen was principally affected, whereas in only one animal the largest brucella dna quantity was found in urine. these differences probably correlated with the stage of infection in individual animals. since the samples at our disposition originated from animals shot by hunters, it was impossible to compare the variation in sensitivity of the different methods during the course of infection, according to clinical status or age.

no brucella bacteria could be isolated from blood samples. this is in concordance with the reports of other authors stating that recovery of the bacteria by blood and milk culture is insensitive  <cit> .

in contrast, is <dig> real-time pcr was able to detect brucella dna in  <dig>  out of  <dig> blood samples . it is relevant to mention that the pcr performance with the brucella dna extracted from blood samples is very often compromised by the presence of pcr inhibitors and further complicated because brucella is an intracellular pathogen  <cit> . however, the protocols presented here make detection of brucella dna from blood samples more feasible because only the leukocyte pellet was used for dna extraction. although it was reported that high concentrations of leukocyte dna could inhibit the pcr assay  <cit> , the ipc  signal was detected for all samples used in this assay except for nine samples, which were inhibited due to poor blood sample quality.

it is interesting to remark the discrepancies with the serological results. comparing serology with the results of the is <dig> assay, only  <dig>  out of  <dig> samples included in the comparative analysis were positive with all serological tests and is <dig> real-time pcr . interestingly, is <dig> real-time pcr detected infection in  <dig> %  of the seronegative wild boars , which prompts us to conclude that these were probably acute or chronically infected animals with antibody levels beyond the detectable limit. latent infection without seroconversion further complicates the problem, particularly in pre-pubertal animals  <cit> . while pcr directly detects the dna of the pathogen, the serology is dependent upon the variable titres of antibodies in different phases of the disease  <cit> . on the other hand, 18%  of is <dig> real-time pcr negative samples were seropositive in our study, which could be either due to a lack of sensitivity of the real-time pcr technique or serological false positives. keeping in mind the well documented problem of extensive serological cross-reactions with other bacteria  <cit> , it is highly likely that a great number of these samples were indeed false positives. further difficulties associated with serological testing in wildlife is the fact that most tests have been directly transposed, without validation, from their use in domestic animals to the wild species, even though they may not perform identically  <cit> .

in order to simplify the comparison, the six equivocal samples in i-elisa, four blood samples for which the result was not obtained with rbt, and nine samples inhibited in the real-time pcr were not included in the comparison .

in summary, in this study, the is <dig> real-time pcr was able to increase the number of positive animals which were negative by bacterial isolation and detect additional positive animals that were seronegative. moreover, not all the seropositive animals were detected positive by the is <dig> real-time pcr. therefore, it is important to use more than one type of diagnostic techniques for the detection of brucellosis in animals, which is an issue that has already been addressed by different authors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the is <dig> assay described here is a sensitive and specific method for detection of brucella spp. in blood and tissue specimens of wild boars. since the data on prevalence of brucellosis in wild boar populations is still being estimated by serology  <cit> , we are of the opinion that this assay should be included in brucellosis screening programs in order to complement the drawbacks of the conventional detection methods. additionally, this assay should also be a method of choice for diagnosis of brucellosis in various wild and zoo animals, considering that current serological tests are evaluated only for domestic animals.
