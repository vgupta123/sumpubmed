BACKGROUND
with a production of  <dig>  millions tons obtained from  <dig>  millions hectares in  <dig>  grapevine  is by far the most important fruit tree crop in the world http://www.oiv.org. in comparison to other fruit crops, it shows a particularly wide range of uses: fresh, dried, transformed in juice and obviously wine. at present, its importance goes beyond the economic level, being wine associated in many cases with national cultures and life style. moreover, red wines are thought to provide health benefits thanks to secondary metabolites such as resveratrol, a strong antioxidant supposed to provide health benefits  <cit> .

despite the obvious economic relevance, most of the grape cultivars grown today were selected several centuries ago from spontaneous crosses and then vegetatively propagated. still today, the release of new varieties is a considerably slow process. this is mainly due to some peculiar genetic and physiological features which indeed are shared with most of the tree crops and which significantly hamper the adoption of modern breeding strategies. the main difficulty for genetic analysis is due to the fact that the genome of grape is highly heterozygous, even if the species is actually mainly autogamous  <cit> . furthermore, grape is a perennial plant with a relatively long life cycle, which makes breeding expensive, due to space constraints, and time consuming  <cit> .

because of the lack of breeding activity, the improvements in grape production have relied mainly on agronomy, including a strong use of chemicals that may have a negative impact on human health and environmental quality. one of the main goals in grapevine breeding is therefore to obtain varieties naturally resistant to various pathogens  <cit> .

as a tool for modern breeding, genome-wide physical maps are assuming a more and more central role because they are useful for many purposes. first of all, even if the technologies for genome sequencing have undergone a remarkable progress during the last years, genome assembly largely depends on physical mapping. the clone-by-clone approach always requires physical mapping, because a minimal tiling path of clones must be selected to separately sequence them  <cit> . nevertheless, also the whole-genome shotgun  strategy greatly benefits from physical data and indeed it is still unclear if it could alone be sufficient to produce a linearly ordered set of sequences  <cit> . a second application of physical maps is the large-scale isolation of genes using the positional cloning approach. in fact, this is the only strategy which can be used to identify genes which can be genetically mapped, but whose function is unknown - which is true for most traits of agronomic importance  <cit> . eventually, physical maps can also be used for several other kinds of studies e.g., to compare genomes and to understand their size and complexity  <cit> .

taking into account all these aspects and considering that grape is an 'orphan species' from a genetic perspective, it is clear that an integrated physical map would be of great utility both for research stricto sensu and for practical applications, such marker-assisted breeding.

grapevine is also attractive for future sequencing efforts, being a diploid organism which can be easily crossed and selfed, and having a relatively small genome of only about  <dig> mb  <cit> . furthermore, grape has several unique features including a novel shoot architecture and non-climateric fruits producing a number of secondary metabolites such as colour pigments, tannins and flavour compounds. finally, as a basal family of the eurosids, the vitaceae are also interesting for comparative studies  <cit> . thus, grape can be regarded as a model organism.

whole-genome physical maps have been constructed for several organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , and chicken  <cit> . in plants, physical maps are available for arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , black cottonwood  <cit> , apple  <cit> , prunus  <cit> , and the grapevine cultivar cabernet sauvignon  <cit> . most of these physical maps have been obtained by adhering to different approaches, mainly by marker hybridization  <cit>  and bac fingerprinting  <cit> .

sequence tagged site content-based methods are laborious and require an extremely high density of markers. this piece of information is rather difficult to obtain for the large of majority of plant genomes, and especially for orphan species  <cit> . on the contrary, fingerprinting-based strategies are better suited to genomes which are not well explored e.g., grape. since these techniques are also more amenable to high-throughput processing, they have been chosen in the last years for the majority of physical mapping projects.

due to their relevance, the techniques of fingerprinting have undergone a fast evolution during the last two decades. indeed, a range of methods has been proposed which vary in several parameters, but especially in the detection of the fingerprinting fragments. these techniques can be divided into three groups, which are the agarose-gel based, the acrylamide-gel based and the capillary sequencer based methods. the last set of approaches, also known as high information content fingerprinting , shows a substantial increase both in the throughput and in the sensitivity of the process  <cit> .

recently, it has been debated on which hicf methodology would work best. xu et al.  <cit>  evaluated five different fingerprinting techniques and concluded that a two-enzymes approach was more effective than the others. this result is rather counterintuitive, since three-, four- or five-enzymes based approaches provide more information and should be able to better discriminate between false positive and false negative errors. indeed, according to nelson and coworkers  <cit> , the most effective protocol is the one developed by luo et al.  <cit> , which indeed is based on the use of five restriction enzymes. this method has been used in this work after adapting it to grape.

recently, important progress has been made in genomics research of various fruit trees and woody plants. the draft genome sequence of the black cottonwood tree, populus trichocarpa, has been completed using a whole genome shotgun approach  <cit> , and a physical map is available as well  <cit> . genome-wide physical maps of the apple and peach genomes have been recently released  <cit> . to end up with, the whole genome sequences of two different genotypes of grapevine are now available, one of which based on the inbred line pn <dig>  <cit> , and the other one based on the heterozygous genotype pinot noir  <cit> . both of these sequencing efforts have been carried out following a wgs approach, therefore without the need of producing an earlier physical map.

here we report a bac-based physical map of the grape genome and its integration with the genetic map, a molecular tool which will change the approach to the genetics and breeding of this crop. as already stated, grapevine cultivars are highly heterozygous  <cit> . physical maps constructed till now present almost no  or very low heterozygosity . the only exceptions are black cottonwood, prunus, apple, and the cabernet sauvignon grapevine cultivar. black cottonwood and apple maps are based on agarose fingerprints and the effects of heterozygosity with such method are smoothened by the higher tolerance allowed in the assembly. beside that, a specific study about the effects of heterozygosity on the map assembly has been performed only in the case of black cottonwood  <cit> . on the other hand, the map of prunus has been obtained with the same fingerprinting method chosen for grape, but other differences make the comparison quite difficult. in fact, the mapping effort in peach has not been completed yet and the clones fingerprinted so far , are biased towards the expressed regions of the genome. moreover, two bac libraries were used in this case, one obtained from a diploid genotype and the other from a haploid one, which could have reduced the impact of heterozygosity. finally, concerning heterozygosity, the map of cabernet sauvignon, obtained with the same protocol as the pinot noir map, lead to similar results: incorrect order of the bac clones within a contig, producing apparent duplications of loci in the physical map and assembly of bac clones corresponding to two different haplotypes into separate contigs. see figure  <dig> and the discussion below for further details, including an in silico simulation related to the effects of heterozygosity on a map assembly.

assessing the effects of heterozygosity on physical maps is important, because there is reason to believe that it could affect their correct assembly, similarly to what has been observed for the dna sequence assembly in ciona savignyi  <cit> . therefore we propose our work as a useful model for any future physical mapping effort on heterozygous genomes, which are very common among plants.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  bac clones from two bac libraries representing approximately  <dig>  genome equivalents  <cit>   of the red wine cultivar pinot noir, one of the most widely grown in the world, were fingerprinted, adapting to grape a fluorescence-based, high-throughput method developed for wheat and rice  <cit> . the  <dig>  clones that remained after processing the raw fingerprint data for background removal and identification of failed, empty, and contaminated clones  were assembled using the software fpc  <dig>   <cit>  and following an iterative method that was first used in maize  <cit>  to minimize the effects of contamination and repetitive bands and to improve the overall quality of the map. the final assembly resulted in  <dig>  contigs estimated to span about  <dig> mb , including  <dig>  bacs  of difficult resolution after fingerprinting , distributed in  <dig> q contigs. the total length of the contigs corresponds roughly to  <dig>  times the estimated  <dig> mb size of the grape genome  <cit> . this indicates that the genome size may have been underestimated  <cit> , or that contig overlaps have gone undetected , but may also result from high dna sequence heterozygosity i.e., from the presence of two very different haplotypes in a single diploid genome. as already stated, physical maps have been constructed so far for species with no  or very low heterozygosity , with the exception of black cottonwood, apple, and prunus. grapevine cultivars are highly heterozygous  <cit> ; adam-blondon , by comparing  <dig> kb of sequenced genomic dna  from both homologous chromosomes, observed  <dig> % of variable nucleotides of which a large proportion  was due to indels that were observed at an average frequency of one every  <dig> bases. furthermore, the recent sequencing of the genome of grape cv pinot noir showed an average  <dig> % of allelic difference between homologous chromosomes by considering both single nucleotide polymorphisms  and indels, with important variations according to the genomic region  <cit> . dna polymorphisms between homologous regions introduce variations in the fingerprints of allelic bac clones, that could result in two different contigs being assembled for a given chromosomal region. in the above mentioned regions of the grapevine cv. cabernet sauvignon genome the sequence divergence between the two homologous chromosomes resulted on average in 37% non shared fingerprint bands as assessed by in silico digestion, with marked differences between regions . as the software fpc is not designed to recognize and bring together "allelic" contigs, an expansion of the physical map due to sequence heterozygosity is a realistic possibility. the expansion of the whole genome dna sequence assembly as a result of high levels of polymorphism has been observed in ciona savignyi  <cit> . v. vinifera is the first highly heterozygous organism for which a bac contig hicf physical map has been constructed. a previous work in maize, where extremely high levels of sequence polymorphism due to transposable element insertions and nucleotide substitutions exist within the species  <cit> , to construct contig maps of specific regions showed that haplotypic differences between chromosomes in a hybrid could often result in separate contigs being assembled for each chromosome  <cit> . nevertheless, the other physical maps constructed on heterozygous genomes show important differences with respect to the case of grapevine and therefore they can only partially be taken as a comparison. to begin with, in the cases of apple and black cottonwood an agarose-based approach was chosen. according to nelson and soderlund  <cit> , repetitive bands in agarose fingerprinting should be less of a problem than in sequencer-based methods because of the bigger size of restriction fragments and to the fact that small indels are not detected. the same pattern could be observed also in the case of heterozygosity. the fact that in the maps of black cottonwood and apple an expansion of about  <dig>  fold the genome was observed compared to  <dig>  fold in the pinot noir could confirms this hypothesis. however, in black cottonwood it was often observed that two different physical contigs aligned to the same region of a sequence contig: this fact suggests the existence of haplotype-specific contigs in the bac map  <cit> . furthermore, if only a single haplotype was considered for each of the co-aligning contigs anchored to the sequence, then the overall genome size estimate represented by the map showed almost no expansion. to sum up, the expansion of the black cottonwood map is, at least partially, due to the formation of allelic physical contigs, but if compared to grapevine the rate of expansion is reduced. the reason for this difference in the expansion could be found in the fingerprinting technique, but also in the different parameters used for the map assembly.

*each fingerprinted band was estimated to represent an average of  <dig>  kb. the estimate was based on the average insert size of the bac clones divided by the average number of bands per clone used for contig assembling

in this work, the impact of dna sequence heterozygosity on the physical map assembly was evaluated by using different approaches. first,  <dig> snp markers were selected and bac clones containing the alternative alleles were identified to ascribe them to the two haplotypes. all of the snp markers had been genetically mapped to a unique position within the genome, to avoid the potentially confounding effect of genome duplications. however, it is to be considered that genome duplications in grapevine should not pose a big problem for the assembly of a physical map. in fact, even if grapevine appears to be an ancient hexaploid  <cit> , the last round of duplication within its genome took place before the separation from black cottonwood, that is about 60- <dig> myrs ago  <cit> . therefore, the impact of duplicated genomic regions  on the map is likely to be very reduced in grapevine, and not as important as it is for instance in soybean  <cit> .

the analysis carried out on this set of snps showed that both haplotypes mapped to the same contig in  <dig>  cases , while each haplotype mapped to a different contig in  <dig>  cases . in the remaining  <dig>  cases , bacs ascribed to the same haplotype were found on more than one contig and showed several different patterns. in  <dig> out of those  <dig> cases, the two haplotypes were found on the same contig, but one or both of the two alleles did also map to other contigs or singletons. in the other  <dig> cases, the two haplotypes were always found on separated contigs, but one or both of the two alleles were found on more than one contig or singleton. altogether, these  <dig> polymorphic markers were found on  <dig> physical contigs, which corresponded to  <dig>  contigs per marker. moreover, if the same calculation was performed on the 'c' class', the value rose to  <dig>  contigs per markers. the finding that allelic bac clones i.e., deriving from each of the two haplotypes, mapped frequently to different contigs is consistent with the increased size of the physical map when compared to the estimated genome size and shows that dna sequence heterozygosity results in significant differences in bac fingerprints. the fpc software resolves such difficulties in a conservative mode increasing contig number. furthermore, this evidence is perfectly in agreement with the results obtained in the physical map of black cottonwood  <cit> . even when the bac clones from the two haplotypes assembled in a single contig  their relative positioning within the contig was often not accurate, with the clones from each haplotype locally assembling separately rather than overlapping each other. this local assembly problem, which we named "scissoring effect", was not observed in the black cottonwood assembly.

second, assemblies were performed using in silico constructed bac fingerprints that simulated differences due to increasing levels of dna heterozygosity between the two allelic haplotypes . the number of q clones increased in parallel to the increase in the dna differences between the haplotypes. this supports the conclusion that the high frequency of contigs with q clones shown in table  <dig> derives largely from the high level of dna heterozygosity. when the differences in fingerprint bands between the two haplotypes reached 42% we also observed a sharp increase in the total map size and in the number of contigs assembled. multiple contigs were often assembled, that frequently contained bac clones from a single haplotype . when the bac clones from the two haplotypes assembled in a single contig  we often observed the same local assembly problem  that we observed in the real contigs that causes an artifactual map expansion. these two phenomena together accounted for the significant expansion of the total map size of the region that reached up to a 40% increase, showing a similar trend to the one that we observe in the real assembly of the grape map. still, it is to be considered that the real fingerprints represent a much more complex situation, due to the perturbing effect of several factors like the presence of residual contaminations, unremoved background peaks, chimeric clones, and the complexity of the whole genome. these aspects are likely to be responsible for the difference between the  <dig> × expansion found in the real assembly and the  <dig> × expansion obtained from the simulated data. in any case, in silico simulations agree with the data from our grape map assembly and with the analysis of the bac clones containing the alternative alleles reported above in terms of map expansion and the separation of haplotypes into different contigs. a difference of 42% in the fingerprint bands obtained from the two haploptypes is realistic given that it requires  <dig> % average nucleotide sequence divergence between them.

for each level of sequence divergence average and standard deviation values were computed for each of the parameters out of ten replicates. coverage values are the ratio between the cb map length of the simulated contig and the cb map length of the original region .

* the average of 42% difference in fingerprint bands results from two areas without differences  and 50% difference in the rest of the region. in the other two cases differences were randomly distributed across the region.

to integrate the physical map with the genetic map, two complementary strategies were adopted. the first was based on developing genetic markers from bac-end sequences and placing them on the linkage map.  <dig> markers were produced using this approach.  <dig> of them were uninformative because derived from clones that were not assembled into contigs and the remaining  <dig> assigned contigs to specific positions on the linkage map. the second strategy made use of bac pools  <cit>  constructed according to klein et al.  <cit> . a six dimensional pooling geometry represented the best compromise to achieve a high efficiency in unambiguous marker assignment to bac clones, while reducing considerably the number of pcr assays. a total of  <dig>  bac clones were pooled in six distinct directions  to generate  <dig> pools. primers for  <dig> microsatellite markers and  <dig> est markers were used to screen the bac pools.  <dig> unique aflp primer combinations that identified  <dig> markers on the pinot noir genetic map  <cit>  were also used.  <dig> ssr and  <dig> est markers could not be assigned unambiguously to bac clones  and were discarded from further analyses. an average of  <dig>  bac clones were identified for ests,  <dig>  for ssrs, and  <dig>  for aflp markers . aflp markers identified a single bac more frequently than ssr or est markers: this can be explained by the high stringency adopted during aflp screenings of pools, which led to discard faint bands that could have resulted in marker mis-assignment to bacs.

following bac screening, each single putatively positive bac clone has been picked and tested to confirm the primary pool screening result.

* average number of bac clones identified for each marker type

 <dig> markers in total were used for the integration of genetic and physical maps, including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> ests,  <dig> aflps, and  <dig> bac-end markers. a total of  <dig> contigs were assigned a position on the genetic map, covering  <dig>  mb. as expected, the average size of unassigned contigs was considerably smaller than the one of positioned contigs .  <dig> contigs, covering  <dig>  mb, were anchored by two or more markers, whereas  <dig>  covering  <dig>  mb, were anchored by one marker. for only  <dig> contigs, covering  <dig>  mb, more than one location was determined on the genetic map because two of the markers located on them mapped at distinct locations on the genetic map. this conflict might depend from errors present either in the genetic or in the physical map, but more likely from genome duplications. although grapevine chromosomes pair as bivalents, and the species has disomic inheritance  <cit> , the genome of grapevine should be considered polyploid  because organized in more than  <dig> chromosomes. this is not surprising because angiosperms have a propensity to polyploidization  <cit> , to the point that recent reviews speak of all angiosperms  <cit> , or 80% of them  <cit> , being to some extent polyploid. data for sequenced dicot genomes indicate that both arabidopsis and poplar may have undergone  <dig> rounds of duplications  <cit> , with the most recent one in poplar leading to high sequence similarity between duplicated regions. thus, some dna markers may identify multiple loci on the physical map, only one of which may have been genetically mapped, leading to contigs being assigned to multiple genetic locations. obviously, one of such two locations should correctly correspond to a given contig.

the physical map assembly was validated at several scales. molecular markers were used to assess the overall quality of our map following an a posteriori approach as described by meyers et al.  <cit> . when two or more genetic markers identified bac clones that were included in a single contig, we observed a very good colinearity of markers in the physical map and in the dense genetic map derived from the cross syrah x pinot noir . if all the contigs anchored to the genetic map by two or more markers were considered, it was possible to observe that in  <dig> out of  <dig>  cases the markers were very close on the genetic map. subsequently, a similar survey was undergone by taking into account only the molecular markers developed from bac end sequences. in fact, these markers offer the best opportunity to validate the physical map assembly since their location on the physical map is unambiguously determined. the results obtained in this second case are very similar to the previous ones. in fact, in  <dig> out of  <dig> such cases  the genetic markers developed from the same contig did co-map or map very closely on the genetic map. then, the assembled sequences of the pinot noir cultivar  <cit>  offered the possibility of controlling bac order in the physical map on a smaller scale. an example is provided in figure  <dig> where three genetic markers present in a region of the linkage map of chromosome  <dig> are positioned in the same order in the dna sequence cluster  <dig> and in the physical contig  <dig>  in addition, it is worth to observe a methodological detail: bacs containing the same marker were correctly assigned to the contig. however, they are not always overlapping as expected, most probably because of the "scissoring effect" that we previously ascribed to the heterozygosity of pinot noir which contributes to the physical map expansion .

afterwards, the sequence of the genome of the inbred line of grape pn <dig>  <cit>  was also used for an assessment of the whole physical map.  <dig>  bac-ends obtained from the 'pinot noir' were positioned on the pn <dig> chromosomes through a stringent blast :  <dig> contigs out of  <dig>  including at least two groups of at least three bac-ends each aligning to different linkage groups were considered chimeric. in most of the cases such contigs were linked by a single chimeric clone .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a resource that facilitates the access to the grapevine genome in several ways. by one hand, this tool can be used to easily create a link between genetic maps and genomic sequences, thus facilitating tasks such as positional cloning or qtl mapping. by another point of view it could also become useful for comparative purposes when studying other species belonging to the family of vitaceae.

the second relevant aspect which has been studied in this work is the effect of heterozygosity on the construction of fingerprinting-based physical maps. experimental and in silico approaches have been undertaken and have given comparable results, thus representing an example of how the use of simulated data can help the study of genomes. furthermore, the description of the effects of heterozygosity in physical mapping could be particularly useful for further studies of genomes showing the same features.

it looks like the assembly could be improved by the utilization of new map assembly algorithms that explicitly deal with the presence of two haplotypes regardless of the levels and patterns of heterozygosity.
