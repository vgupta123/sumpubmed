BACKGROUND
losses of market-weight pigs present economic, legal and animal welfare issues to u.s. swine producers and include dead, non-ambulatory, fatigued and injured pigs  <cit> . although the incidence occurs at low frequency  these losses are substantial due to added labor and disposal costs, along with loss of full-value product and have been estimated to be over $ <dig> , <dig> per year in the u.s. fatigued, non-ambulatory pigs exhibit acute stress symptoms including open-mouth breathing, discoloration  and blotching of skin, muscle tremors, abnormal vocalization and refusal to move, similar to what is observed in pigs with malignant hyperthermia due to a mutation in the ryanodine receptor  <dig> gene   <cit> . a dna-based test has been available since the discovery of the mutation and producers have been able eliminate the unfavorable ryr <dig> allele from their herds  <cit> . over a decade ago it was found that half of the pigs arriving dead or dying at the packing plants carried at least one copy of the ryr <dig> mutation  <cit> . by  <dig> the number of dead and non-ambulatory pigs that carried the ryr <dig> mutation was about 5%  <cit> ; thus, the mutation was still present at a low frequency at that time  <cit> . however, a high proportion of ryr <dig> normal pigs show a sensitivity to halothane anesthesia  <cit>  and are more prone to becoming non-ambulatory after handling  <cit> . pigs that are more sensitive to halothane exposure may also have inferior pork quality  <cit> . these relationships are believed to have a genetic basis; however, the specific cause has yet to be identified.

in the u.s. meat animal research center’s swine research population, a novel stress syndrome was detected. test matings were made to characterize the syndrome’s physiological effects and its genetic basis. this study reports the identification of a novel porcine stress syndrome and mapping of the defect to dystrophin.

RESULTS
identification and challenge of stress susceptible pigs
the original mating that produced pigs that died after transport was repeated. five males were born and three were classified as affected when they died after administration of isoflurane anesthesia. because isoflurane challenge seemed to elicit a stress response, this treatment was used to test pigs from subsequent suspect litters. a total of  <dig> piglets from  <dig> litters  were challenged with isoflurane anesthesia and we obtained at least one plasma creatine phosphokinase  measurement for  <dig> pigs, before or after anesthesia challenge. pigs were classified as being affected if they died during handling, transport or isoflurane challenge or had high cpk levels and an abnormal ecg . heart rates of unaffected pigs remained steady throughout anesthesia challenge. the average cpk levels were more than three times higher in affected pigs compared to their unaffected littermates both before and after isoflurane challenge . females that were later confirmed to be carriers, based on genotype and progeny testing, had cpk levels that were not different from unaffected animals before or after isoflurane challenge . isoflurane treatment itself did not affect cpk levels. of the forty-nine presumed affected pigs, based on isoflurane response, cpk levels or assessment of their ecg, only  <dig> died during anesthesia. these animals showed signs of respiratory distress and a rapid decline in heart rate usually within one minute of anesthesia. eight affected animals died a few days after challenge while being transported.

a pre-challenge was at 7 weeks of age, post-challenge was at 8 weeks of age after isoflurane treatment.

b mean and standard error of plasma cpk in units/liter. of  <dig> pigs that were sampled, not all the normal animals were challenged with isoflurane anesthesia.

c values were not different before or after challenge; affected pigs had significantly greater cpk activity than normal or carrier pigs .

mapping the stress syndrome locus
to identify the genomic region associated with the stress syndrome, the coding regions of porcine orthologs of human malignant hyperthermia  genes ryr <dig>  cacna1s, cpt <dig> and ryr <dig> were sequenced for snp discovery in the proband’s family . no obvious mutations were identified comparing normal and affected siblings and the syndrome did not segregate with snp alleles in any of the human candidate genes. a larger pedigree of  <dig> pigs, including  <dig> affected animals was then genotyped with the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip. genotypes were called for  <dig>  snps spanning the entire porcine genome and  <dig>  of these could be mapped to build  <dig>   of the pig genome. genome-wide association analysis was done using the case/control association option of plink  <cit> . only one chromosomal region had highly significant snp associations, six of which were located between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on the x chromosome . when only the  <dig> animals that died during transport or isoflurane challenge were classified as affected in the analysis, a similar but less significant association was found with the same markers at the dystrophin locus .the two most significant snps on the beadchip  are located within intron  <dig> of the dystrophin gene . all of the affected animals were hemizygous or homozygous for a shared haplotype.

sequencing of the porcine dystrophin gene
the exons and flanking intron sequences of dmd were obtained from normal and affected pigs by pcr amplification and direct sequencing. no polymorphisms were identified near splice sites. the cdna from normal and affected animals was also amplified and sequenced and there was no evidence of alternative splicing or deletion of exons in the affected animals. the promoter regions p <dig>  p <dig> and the muscle-specific promoter were sequenced and no obvious mutations were found. forty-seven snps were found in dmd by sequencing  <dig> members of the affected family; of these, five non-synonymous polymorphisms were found in the coding region . one snp in particular, 85890_ <dig>  that causes the amino acid change arginine to tryptophan at amino acid  <dig>  in exon  <dig> was predicted by polyphen- <dig>  <cit>   to be damaging with a probability score of  <dig> .

association of dystrophin snps with porcine stress syndrome
the snps in the dystrophin gene identified by sequencing were genotyped across the same pedigree and analyzed for association. the 85890_ <dig> snp  was as highly associated with the stress response as the two most significant snps on the illumina beadchip . the c allele  was found in all unaffected animals and the t allele  was found in affected and carrier females. a survey of  <dig> presumably unaffected 2008-born barrows from  <dig> sires and  <dig> dams all carried the c allele. the founding ancestors of this population were genotyped for the 85890_ <dig> snp and five of  <dig> landrace boars carried the t allele, while all  <dig> of the duroc boars carried the c allele. of  <dig> of the founding dams  that were genotyped, two were homozygous and four were heterozygous for the t allele. in a panel of  <dig> unrelated boars of different breeds  <cit> , the t allele was only found in  <dig> of  <dig> landrace and  <dig> of  <dig> hampshire boars.

evaluation of cardiac and skeletal muscle for the dystrophin defect
histopathology of affected left ventricular cardiac tissues showed evidence of myofibrillar degeneration and necrosis . myocardial fibers showed loss of cross-striation, pyknotic nuclei and associated aggregation of lymphocytes. immunoblots of heart and skeletal muscle protein from 8 week-old pigs using mandys <dig>  a mouse monoclonal anti-dystrophin antibody that recognizes residues 1431– <dig> in spectrin repeat regions  <dig> and  <dig> of human dystrophin, showed a dramatic reduction  in dystrophin protein in affected pigs compared to normal littermates . similarly, immunoblots of heart total protein from 6 month-old pigs using mandra <dig>  a mouse monoclonal anti-dystrophin antibody that recognizes residues 3667– <dig> in the c-terminus of the human protein, showed a similar reduction in the amount of protein, as well . real-time qpcr of dystrophin in  <dig> affected and  <dig> unaffected heart tissues using primers in exons  <dig> and  <dig> showed no difference in dystrophin mrna abundance .

discussion
we have identified a porcine stress syndrome that can be induced by transport, handling or isoflurane anesthesia. affected animals quickly become non-ambulatory, have difficulty breathing and rarely recover. isoflurane anesthesia was tested to elicit a stress response because we thought the stress syndrome was a malignant hyperthermia, similar to the classic porcine stress syndrome. isoflurane is more readily available, less irritating to the respiratory system and has replaced halothane as a common anesthesia for veterinary applications. although the response is delayed, compared to halothane, isoflurane can also induce malignant hyperthermia in swine  <cit> . using the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip we were able to map the defect to dystrophin on the x chromosome and show that affected animals have reduced dystrophin protein in heart and skeletal muscle and elevated cpk levels in blood. these animals, however, have no apparent muscle impairment later in life. dystrophin is the largest gene in the mammalian genome covering  <dig>  megabases of dna, and contains  <dig> exons and multiple tissue-specific promoters and transcripts  <cit> . mutations in dystrophin cause duchennes muscular dystrophy , becker muscular dystrophy  and x-linked dilated cardiomyopathy  in humans  <cit> . most cases of dmd or bmd involve deletions/duplications, followed by nonsense mutations and/or microdeletions/insertions, most of which cause a frameshift or exon skipping; missense mutations are extremely rare  <cit> . dmd is usually caused by deletions, duplications or nonsense mutations that disrupt or truncate the reading frame, while bmd mutations usually preserve the reading frame  <cit> . these allelic forms are generally characterized by the severity and age of onset of the disease with dmd manifesting within the first few years of life as a progressive weakness and wasting of muscle, while bmd occurs in later decades and is more variable in severity. patients with either dmd or bmd usually develop dilated cardiomyopathy independent of the degree of skeletal muscle involvement  <cit>  and usually have higher than normal circulating levels of cpk  <cit> . likewise, patients with xlcm  <cit> , also have elevated cpk, probably due to increased membrane permeability  <cit> , because the absence of dystrophin makes the membrane more susceptible to tears under the force of contraction. cardiomyopathy that occurs without skeletal muscle involvement is frequently caused by missense mutations in the dystrophin gene  <cit> . dystrophinopathies can also present with arrhythmia  <cit>  or cardiorespiratory arrest after isoflurane anesthesia  <cit> . the pathophysiological reasons for anesthesia-induced cardiac arrest in patients with dystrophinopathies are unknown, however it is postulated that damaged, leaky muscle fibers  can lead to increased intracellular calcium and potassium released into the blood  and cardiac arrest  <cit> . it has been reported that isoflurane anesthesia or stress induced rhabdomyolosis, hyperkalemia and death in dystrophin-deficient cats  <cit> . this is the only report of stress-induced death in a dystrophic animal.

dystrophin protein is usually absent by western blot in dmd patients, while bmd patients usually have a decreased amount of normal or abnormal size protein  <cit> , which is similar to the phenotype seen in the affected pigs. while it is not clear why missense mutations cause a reduction in dystrophin protein  <cit>  it may be due to damage of the protein by contractile stress.

one of the nonsynonymous snps, , which causes an amino acid change of arginine to tryptophan at amino acid  <dig>  was the most significant marker for the stress response and could possibly be the causative mutation. the snp is in exon  <dig> of dystrophin, which codes for spectrin repeat  <dig> of the central coiled-coil rod domain  <cit> . this basic repeat region is in the second actin-binding domain of dystrophin   <cit>  and has also been shown to bind lipid  <cit> . although in vitro mutation studies have not been reported for abd <dig>  missense mutations in actin-binding domain  <dig>  can cause protein instability, misfolding and aggregation  <cit> , leading to a reduction of expressed protein.

the variant t allele of 85890_ <dig>  could be tracked to some of the founding sires and dams in the affected families. the frequency of this allele was higher than expected, based on the rate of spontaneous deaths of feeder-aged pigs in the population. thus, if this is the causative mutation, the penetrance of this defect is not extremely high. further studies are required to determine the causal genetic variation, the penetrance of this phenotype and if this locus accounts for losses during transportation of market weight animals.

CONCLUSIONS
genetic mapping indicated the causative variation for a novel porcine stress syndrome is likely in the dystrophin gene. in addition to muscular dystrophies, mutations in human dystrophin can cause dilated cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolosis and a malignant hyperthermia-like reaction in response to inhaled anesthesia, supporting the conclusion that this locus causes the observed phenotypes in pigs. the identification of the causative mutation in these families will allow investigation of the prevalence of this disease in commercial populations and its pleiotropic effects.
