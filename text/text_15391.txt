BACKGROUND
plant roots have been long studied and yet investigations of root behavior, physiology, and biochemistry continue to be actively explored on every level . the work presented here seeks further insights into root growth strategies by focusing on two distinct growth patterns of root growth, skewing and waving. skewing is when the steady-state growth direction of a root deviates from the direction of the gravity vector and waving is when the root undulates back and forth over time along its direction of growth . skewing and waving have been described as gravity-enhanced touch responses, since these root patterns are notably present when a plant is grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. current models require that gravity pulls the root tip down onto the tilted surface, which increases the mechanical impedance to growth, and results in root skewing and root waving  <cit> . however, recent spaceflight experiments with arabidopsis thaliana  on the international space station  have shown that certain ecotypes have roots that deviate from vertical growth  and wave in the absence of gravity . these ecotypes that exhibit spaceflight skewing are also the ecotypes that exhibit terrestrial skewing when grown at an angle . the degree of skewing in spaceflight was consistent with previous terrestrial observations, but the waving pattern was different from what was typically observed on the ground  <cit> . the causes of skewing – and subsequently, the genes involved – are currently unknown. the goal of this study is to discover which genes are associated with root skewing through transcription microarrays.

other root tropisms exist as a result of environmental interaction, which likely impact the degree of root skewing and root waving. touch responses, or thigmotropism, involves many genes that interact with auxin and can subsequently alter growth patterns . plants also determine their growth in relation to the gravity vector, resulting in a gravitropic set-point angle , which is most commonly associated with lateral organ growth relative to the primary organ  <cit> . gsa is driven by auxin and transport inhibitor response 1/auxin signaling f-box -dependent signaling, in a process similar to gravitropism . light can alter gsa for different plant systems  <cit> , and light in general plays a role in root patterning and growth direction . additional tropisms include halotropism  <cit> , chemotropism  <cit> , hydrotropism  <cit> , all of which can alter root growth response .

many hypotheses exist for the underlying molecular mechanisms and key genes responsible for root skewing and root waving. as a result, a wide variety of genes have been implicated as involved in these growth patterns. hormone related pathways and processes are among the candidates, such as ethylene involvement in root waving  <cit>  and auxin and tryptophan biosynthesis in both skewing and waving  <cit> . the cytoskeleton is also involved in skewing and waving  <cit> , including wave-dampened  <dig>  and wvd2-like  <dig>  genes, which alter cell expansion through microtubule bundle organization  <cit> . many genes involved in molecular patterning, signaling, phosphorylation, and cell wall structure are also involved in root skewing and waving. guanosine triphosphate -binding proteins  <cit> , cell expansion gene root hair defective  <dig>  with putative gtp-binding motif  <cit> , clavata-related genes  <cit> , protein phosphatase/pp2a enhanced ethylene response  <dig> , serine/threonine protein kinases wag <dig> and wag <dig> , and knotted-like from arabidopsis thaliana  <dig>  are all associated with morphological change in root skewing or root waving. the sku family of genes were identified through phenotypic changes in root behavior, with sku <dig>  and related genes being involved with cell wall modification and root growth  <cit>  and sku <dig>  and family being involved with cortical microtubule and directional cell expansion  <cit> . while no single pathway has been identified in the literature as responsible for root skewing or for root waving, several different pathways have evidence for being involved.

skewing and waving are functionally separable using genetics  <cit> . the physiological separation of skewing from waving within a ecotype can be accomplished by using the environment, particularly the tilt angle of the growth plate, and can also occur in spaceflight . the degree to which growth plates are tilted is referred to as the angle of the growth plate . typically, plates are tilted backward such that plants are above the media surface, at agp 45°. for many arabidopsis ecotypes, growth at agp 45° results in roots that both skew and wave. when growth plates are tilted forward, such that plants are below the media surface, at agp 135°, arabidopsis roots skew with reduced waving, similar to the pattern observed in spaceflight. growth plates held vertically are agp 90° and are considered as the controls for growth angle, as roots on vertical plates generally do not skew or wave.

this study aims to discover additional genes associated with root skewing through transcription microarray analyses of arabidopsis roots exhibiting different patterns of waving and skewing. gene expression profiles were derived from arabidopsis that displayed different root growth behaviors in various growth environments in order to identify gene activities associated with skewing and waving. identified genes were validated using qrt-pcr and evaluated using previous studies for likelihood of involvement with the skewing process.

RESULTS
arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave differently from one another in different growth environments
arabidopsis ecotypes wassilewskija  and columbia  differ in their skewing and waving behaviors, where ws demonstrates strong skewing and waving while col- <dig> waves like ws but does not greatly skew, which was a growth pattern observed in spaceflight and on the ground . these two ecotypes were grown at three growth angles  to produce different root phenotypes . plants were grown for 3 days vertically, then moved to each respective agp for  <dig> more days, resulting in steady-state behavior in each of the agp.fig.  <dig> various comparisons of microarray data reveals different genes involved in root skewing and waving. arrows point to control used in each experiment. vertical arrows indicate comparisons within ecotypes, horizontal arrows indicate comparisons between ecotypes. eight-day experiment designed to isolate each permutation of root skewing and root waving and identify genes responsible. vertical comparisons reveal genes responsible for changing the root growth pattern in response to different agp – for ws, these genes correlate to skewing and waving phenotypes. horizontal comparisons reveal genes responsible for differences in skewing and waving for col- <dig> and ws roots. numbers indicate gene transcripts with different levels of transcripts from controls. significance cutoffs of |log2| >  <dig>  p <  <dig>

the first analysis compared transcriptional differences within a ecotype caused by the environmental condition of agp, specifically differences between ws roots grown at agp 90° and ws roots grown at agp 45° or 135°, and the differences between col- <dig> roots grown at agp 90° and col- <dig> roots grown at agp 45° or 135°. only the agp influenced the differences in gene expression and root morphology. roots were quantified following parameters identified in previous work  <cit>  using protocols outlined in the materials and methods section. the arrows in fig.  <dig> represent comparisons analyzed. figure  <dig> also shows a diagram of the root morphology for each genotype under each agp.

the second analysis compared transcriptional differences between ecotypes at each agp . in this case, the ecotype influenced gene expression and morphology at the given agp. the horizontal arrows in fig.  <dig> show these comparisons.

this matrix of comparisons allows two overlapping approaches to using differential expression to identify genes associated with skewing. ws roots skew significantly more than col- <dig> roots at agp 135° and significantly more than ws roots at agp 90° . at agp 45° ws roots skew more than col- <dig> roots, but both ws and col- <dig> roots also wave at 45°. quantification of root morphometrics is found in fig.  <dig>  using horizontal growth index , straightness , and wave density . comparisons involving agp 45° allow the removal of waving as a confounding factor in the gene expression analyses.

col- <dig> roots showed  <dig> significantly altered transcripts related to agp, most of which may be involved in waving.

when gene expression profiles of roots grown at agp 45° were compared to agp 90°,  <dig> genes were shown to be differentially regulated, three of which were upregulated and  <dig> of which were downregulated . col- <dig> plants grown at agp 45° had roots that waved but did not skew as compared to the roots of plants grown at agp 90°. thus these  <dig> differentially expressed genes were associated with a root waving and but not root skewing.fig.  <dig> comparison of transcriptomes as they relate to morphology. heat maps illustrate differences generated by angle of the growth plate  or genetic differences. a genes with altered transcription within col- <dig> compared to the control of agp 90°. col- <dig> had  <dig> gene transcripts altered at agp  <dig> ° and  <dig> altered at agp 135°. data in the heat map corresponds with data in table  <dig>  b genes with altered transcription within ws compared to the control of agp 90°. ws had  <dig> altered gene transcripts at agp 45° and  <dig> altered at agp 135°. data in heat map corresponds with data in additional file 1: table s <dig>  c transcript comparisons between col- <dig> and ws ecotypes – a genetic comparison – with morphological diagrams corresponding to each of the categories  of gene expression profile. transcripts between the ecotypes were removed if they were altered at the same level at all agp. for example, if the transcript for gene a was downregulated  <dig> fold in all conditions, it was removed. this comparison between col- <dig> and ws had  <dig> altered gene transcripts at agp 90°,  <dig> altered between col- <dig> and ws at agp 45°, and  <dig> altered between col- <dig> and ws at agp 135°. data in heat map corresponds to data in additional file 2: table s <dig> 




comparison of gene expression profiles of roots grown at agp 135° with profiles of roots grown at agp 90° , revealed only  <dig> genes that were differentially regulated between the two growth conditions. all  <dig> of these genes were downregulated. morphologically, col- <dig> roots grown at agp 135° were not significantly different from those grown at agp 90° . four genes out of these six were also present among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the agp 45° comparison to agp 90°, with just  <dig> being unique .

thus the  <dig> genes unique to the agp 45° comparison to their 90° controls may represent genes associated with root waving, but not skewing. many different processes were associated with these  <dig> genes identified, such as cell wall structure  and sugar transport .

only four genes had altered transcript levels at both agp 45° and 135°, meaning that they responded to both the backward and forward tilted growth environments . all four of these genes were downregulated at approximately the same levels in both conditions. these genes were at4g <dig> , thioredoxin h <dig> , defective in induced resistance  <dig> , and cell wall invertase  <dig> .

ws showed  <dig> significantly altered transcripts related to agp, revealing candidates genes involved in skewing
these comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the right column of fig.  <dig>  the number of genes with significantly altered transcripts is located next to the appropriate arrow in fig.  <dig> | > 1; p <  <dig> ). false discovery rate  corrections are found in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

at agp 45°, ws produces roots that both skew and wave compared to the roots grown vertically . gene expression profiles revealed that ws that were grown at agp 45° had  <dig> genes with altered transcription in roots compared to agp 90°. nine of the  <dig> genes were upregulated, while  <dig> were downregulated . these genes may represent those involved in both skewing and waving processes. processes associated with these genes include lipid transfer , pectin methylesterase inhibition , and peroxidase activity .

when grown at agp 135° ws produces roots that skew without waving . gene expression profiles revealed that ws roots grown at agp 135° had  <dig> genes with altered transcription in roots compared to ws roots grown at agp 90°. these  <dig> genes are likely skewing-related . only two genes  also had differential transcription in col- <dig>  and the expression level of din <dig> was in opposite directions . some of the processes included are methionine metabolism related , histone-related , and jacalin-related . other genes from these  <dig> will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

the genes with altered transcription in both agp 45° and at agp 135°  were altered in the same way in both agp 45° and 135° compared to agp 90°, except for one gene. this one gene was asparagine synthetase   <dig> , which was downregulated in agp 45° and upregulated in agp 135°, and is involved in darkness responses and sucrose starvation responses. the remaining  <dig> genes were involved in various processes, including cell wall reorganization  and sugar transport .

transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed genes that could be involved in skewing in ws
the gene expression profiles between col- <dig> and ws when skewing and waving were also compared. these comparisons are represented in fig.  <dig> by the horizontal arrows pointing toward ws, with the number of significantly altered levels of gene transcripts indicated above each arrow. genes altered between col- <dig> and ws at the same level in all three growth angles were removed from the comparison, as they represent inherent differences between the cultivars that were independent of the testing environments. the plant images and morphometrics are found in fig.  <dig>  with resulting heat map with six different patterns of expression pattern categories in fig.  <dig> and gene annotations, information, and significance cutoffs in additional file 2: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of candidate skew genes from physiological and genotypic comparisons. a venn diagram of gene numbers from fig.  <dig>  illustrating overlap of  <dig> genes. the left circle represents total number of genes changed in ws  and the right circle represents total number of genes changed between col- <dig> and ws in groups iv, v, and vi . b genes with altered transcription identified in fig. 3b  were combined with genes with altered transcription identified in groups iv, v, and vi of fig. 3c , resulting in  <dig> genes. the majority of overlapping gene transcripts occurs with agp 135° – a growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving – totaling  <dig> highly probable skew gene candidates , shown here in bolded text with dark connecting lines




the first differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between col- <dig> and ws only when grown agp 90°. genes 1– <dig> had altered transcript levels in category i ;  <dig> of the identified genes were upregulated and  <dig> of which were downregulated . this pattern indicated inherent genetic differences between these two lines in their control condition and these differences were mitigated or no longer present in other tested growth environments.

the second differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between col- <dig> and ws when cultivars grown agp 90°, but also had altered transcripts in a same way when grown at agp 45°. genes 62– <dig> had altered transcript levels in category ii ;  <dig> of the identified genes were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated when comparing the gene expression in col- <dig> to ws roots . this expression pattern was not considered to be involved with skewing, since agp 45° results in a combination of skewing and waving in ws and waving in col- <dig>  additionally, the genes identified in this expression pattern were not significantly different in agp 135°, which generates skewing without waving in ws and a non-skewing, non-waving phenotype in col- <dig> .

the third expression pattern had altered transcript levels between col- <dig> and ws when grown agp 90° and at agp 135°. genes 86– <dig> had altered transcript levels in category iii ;  <dig> of the identified genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes downregulated when comparing col- <dig> to ws . at agp 135° ws skewed and col- <dig> did not, yet these genes showed same differential expression between col- <dig> and ws roots when grown at agp 90° and do not exhibit any skewing or waving differences . these genes were likely not involved with skewing.

the fourth expression pattern had altered transcript levels between col- <dig> and ws only when both were grown at agp 45°. genes 129– <dig> had altered transcript levels in category iv ;  <dig> of the identified genes were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated . the genes identified represent a combination of skewing and waving phenomena, and as such, were considered as potential root skewing candidates.

the fifth expression pattern had altered transcript levels at both agp 45° and 135° when comparing col- <dig> roots to ws roots. genes 167– <dig> had altered transcript levels in category v ;  <dig> of the identified genes were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated . skewing occurred in ws but not in col- <dig> in both conditions , although at agp 45°, skewing occurred with waving. for ws roots, skewing was a distinguished morphological phenotype from col- <dig>  the genes identified had altered transcript levels in both agp 45° and 135°, and are therefore likely involved with skewing.

the sixth and final expression pattern had altered transcript levels at agp 135° only, when comparing col- <dig> to ws. genes 193– <dig> had altered transcript levels in category vi ;  <dig> of the identified genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated, meaning that ws had higher levels of these  <dig> genes when compared to col- <dig>  these identified genes were likely involved in skewing since skewing occurs in ws at agp 135° with minimal waving but it does not in col- <dig>  thus is the only phenotypic difference between the roots of the two ecotypes . the genes from the fifth and the sixth expression patterns, totaling  <dig> genes, were selected as a root skewing candidate genes.

overlap of skew gene candidates from all comparisons further narrows the set of skew gene candidates
when combining the lists of genes identified in categories iv, v, and vi  with genes identified within ws comparisons ,  <dig> genes are shared . this overlap is illustrated by the venn diagram in fig. 4a. the majority of shared genes between the two data sets involved agp 135° – the growth condition that elicited skewing with minimal waving – resulting in  <dig> genes, which were named the highly probable skew gene candidates . several of the hpsgc have been verified with qrt-pcr, showing similar trends to the transcriptomic microarray data . the hpsgc are involved in a variety of cellular processes. additionally, only  <dig> of these  <dig> genes were shared with the set of genes identified in col- <dig> grown at agp 45°, which induced root waving . two of these genes  were expressed in opposite directions, while the remaining gene  was upregulated in all sets.table  <dig> hpsgc and their various functional groups and signaling pathways that could contribute to ws root skewing

discussion
transcriptome comparisons within ecotypes reveal a primary set of  <dig> candidate genes involved in skewing
the primary set of  <dig> candidate genes involved in skewing was identified by comparing the transcription of ws genes when grown at agp 45° or 135° compared to agp 90°. morphologically, ws roots skew when grown at agp 135° with reduced waving . the genes with altered transcription identified in this comparison of agp 135° to agp 90° represent the pool of genes likely involved in root skewing and not waving, since they were altered in a condition that induces root skewing independent of the classical root waving patterns. ws roots also skew when grown at agp 45°; however, the occurrence of waving at agp 45° complicates the relationship between skewing and transcriptome at agp 45°. it is important to note that only roots were used for the microarrays, and that lateral roots appeared to be similar across all treatments. as seen in table  <dig>  the  <dig> genes associated with skewing cluster into a few biological categories, suggesting that several pathways interact to produce skewed growth and directionality.

col- <dig> roots, on the other hand, did not skew as did ws roots, and as such, differed only in waving when agp 45° or 135° were compared to agp 90°. the number of genes with altered transcription at agp 45° or 135° compared to agp 90° was also reduced, and not considered in the list of candidate skew genes due to the lack of skewing morphology.

transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed a different set of  <dig> genes that may be involved in skewing
comparing gene expression patterns between ws and col- <dig> shows how the ecotypes cope with the same environmental challenges presented to them, in this case whether the angle of the growth plate produces skewed roots. in order to determine which gene expression patterns are related to skewing, the relative expression patterns can be correlated to the morphology generated in each of the growth angles.

categories i-iii in fig. 3c are not related to skewing. the first category  contains genes that were different between ws and col- <dig> at agp 90° and also unchanged at agp 45° or 135° . the second category  contained genes that were differentially expressed between ws and col- <dig> at agp 45°. however, the transcript expression of these genes was also different when the roots did not skew at agp  <dig>  which suggests that these genes are responding to growth angle but are not responsible for causing the morphologic change. the same logic can be applied to the genes of category iii, where transcript expression was different between ws and col- <dig> when grown at agp 90° and when grown at agp 135° .

the genes of category iv present a pattern of expression that indicated a potential role in skewing , since the genes present in this category are differentially expressed between ws  and col- <dig> . some of the genes identified in this category include his1- <dig>  sku <dig> similar  <dig> , and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase  <dig> . sks <dig> is related to a known sku gene , which is also known to have substantial impact on root growth and morphology  <cit> . protein products of xth <dig> reduce cell wall elongation in roots with altered root hair morphology  <cit> , which may also impact the overall directionality or skewing of the root.

the second category of genes whose differential expression between ws and col- <dig> indicated a role in skewing  contains genes that were differentially expressed between the ecotypes at both agp 45° and  <dig>  the transcription of these genes was altered in the same way at both growth angles, and since skewing occurred at both growth angles , it can be assumed that these genes very likely play some role in the skewing morphology . a couple of the genes identified include modifier of snc <dig>  <dig>  and bel1-like homeodomain  <dig> . mos <dig> is a dna-binding gene that plays a role in the immune response pathway and in microrna  maturation  <cit> . mirnas are heavily involved in gene regulation  <cit> . since col- <dig> roots have higher transcript levels of mos <dig> at both agp 45° and 135° than ws, it is possible that mirnas are involved early in the signaling pathway leading toward root growth parallel with gravity. the lower levels of mos <dig> in ws roots could be limiting the rate of signal transduction, changing the entire pathway, and ultimately changing root directionality and introducing root skewing. bel <dig> was upregulated in col- <dig> roots compared to ws roots grown at agp 45° or 135° . bel <dig> is a transcription factor that interacts with plp, a blue light receptor also involved in response to salt or dehydration stresses  <cit> . higher or lower intracellular levels of phosphate could alter the ability of this gene to interact downstream in phosphate signaling pathways  <cit> . additionally, inorganic phosphate depravation can influence seemingly redundant signal peptides to subsequently alter root growth  <cit> , which may, in turn, alter overall root directionality and impact skewing.

the third category of genes that indicated a role in skewing  contains genes that were differentially expressed between col- <dig> and ws when roots were grown at agp 135°. since ws roots skewed at this growth angle and did not wave differently from roots grown at agp 90°, the genes identified in this category were considered likely to be associated with skewing. some of the genes in this category include responsive to aba  <dig>  and pinoid binding protein  <dig> . rab <dig> was downregulated in col- <dig> roots compared to ws roots at agp 135°. this dehydrin-related protein is reduced after exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  application, meaning it responds directly to ethylene in addition to abscisic acid   <cit> . pbp <dig> was downregulated in col- <dig> roots compared to ws roots at agp 135°. since this pinoid-binding protein is upregulated by auxin  <cit> , the different pbp <dig> levels between col- <dig> and ws could indicate different auxin levels between the two ecotypes  <cit> . additional genes identified in category vi will be discussed in the following section, due to their overlap with previously identified skew gene candidates.

eleven genes remaining across all sets are most likely to be involved in skewing in various processes
a subset of most likely candidate genes was identified by the intersection of the list based on growth angle in ws and the list based on comparative gene expression between ws and col- <dig> , with the overlap of the two lists indicated in the venn diagram, found in fig. 4a. the list of  <dig> genes based on growth angle of ws  was compared to the list of  <dig> genes identified between col- <dig> and ws , producing  <dig> genes that appear in both lists . the majority of these  <dig> genes are found involving agp 135°, shown in bold text and dark lines. agp 135° was the growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving in ws, so to have the majority of overlapping genes identified by both the physiological and genotypic comparisons represented in this agp provides more support for their involvement in root skewing. these  <dig> genes are noted as the highly probable skew gene candidates .

the  <dig> hpsgc are involved in many different processes and were subjected to a thorough literature and expression map search using many available databases, such as suba <dig>  tair, and the arabidopsis efp browser . these genes were searched with the goal of finding associations with cell expansion, division, auxin transport, or any process involved with root tropisms, so as to develop insights into their roles in skewing. sub-organ localizations  were noted where possible. a summary of these results is found in table  <dig>

hkt <dig> is expressed in the proto and metaphloem of the zone of maturation in arabidopsis roots  <cit> , and is linked to salt and water stress responses  <cit> . knockout hkt <dig> has significantly lower root sugars and higher tricarboxylic acid following salt stress, indicating a role for sugar metabolism in salt stress  <cit> . hkt <dig> is also regulated by cytokinin  <cit> , and has a close interaction with abscisic acid insensitive  <dig> , where both gene products are expressed in the same cells and abi <dig> binds to sites in the hkt <dig> promoter  <cit> .




the  <dig> hpsgc show similar expression patterns in that none are particularly expressed in the root tip versus the rest of the root and are all closely related into one co-expression and co-localization network , despite being members of disparate signaling pathways and potential activities . these different signaling and environmental sensing pathways, such as salt, sugar, and darkness responses, are linked by their individual gene members. for example, asn <dig>  sweet <dig>  and hkt <dig> are involved in sucrose response, sugar transport, and salt signaling, respectively. these three genes, which are not co-expressed or co-localized with one another, are all co-expressed with a common gene , which further complicates the roles of each gene involved. other hpsgc are involved with more downstream processes. din <dig> and sis are involved in two different environmental sensing and cell signaling processes, are co-localized with one another, and are both co-localized with actin depolymerizing factor  <dig>  and plant invertase/pectin methylesterase  <dig> , both of which are involved in cell wall remodeling. other genes pulled in by this co-expression and co-localization network are related to handling sugar signaling downstream of sensing, such as sugar transporter  <dig>  and like sex <dig>  <dig> . an additional network file shows the relationship between hpsgc and these additional genes . this computational approach to the hpsgc illustrates possibilities for how these environmental sensing and signaling pathway genes could be involved in the generation of root skewing.fig.  <dig> co-expression and co-localization network of hpsgc shows each member is linked with others. additionally, other genes pulled into the network are other members of the same signaling networks or downstream cell wall remodeling. network generated with genemania  <cit> 




sugar signaling is a major signaling pathway identified in the skew gene candidates. sucrose efflux transporters sweet <dig> and sweet <dig> were both upregulated in ws roots grown at agp 45° and 135°. sweet <dig>  a member of the hpsgc, was also upregulated in col- <dig> roots grown at agp 45° . these genes are also associated with response to salt stress, divalent metal ion transport, and are integral in the endomembrane system  <cit> . sweet <dig> and sweet <dig> are shown to assist in phloem unloading into the apoplast  <cit> , with sweet <dig> responding to co <dig> as well  <cit> . this sugar transport could be used for signaling, as other members of the mtn3/saliva/sweet-family of genes are involved with ion transport and physiological process regulation  <cit> . root exudates are also involved in regulation of the surrounding microbiome and microenvironment  <cit> , and these sweet efflux proteins may be involved in shaping root growth and directionality through signaling. additionally, asn <dig> was upregulated in ws roots grown at agp 135° and was downregulated in both col- <dig> and ws roots grown at agp 45° . asn <dig> responds to sucrose starvation, and mrna accumulation is suppressed with sugar in some tests  <cit> . additionally, both of these genes are responsive to absence of light, and may be involved in light/sugar signaling pathways . it is possible that asn <dig> would be involved with the aforementioned sweet family network. both din <dig> and asn <dig> were upregulated in the presence of various heavy metals, further implicating their roles in environmental signaling pathways  <cit> , with asn <dig> being expressed in the elongation and maturation zones in the root  <cit> .

other genes in the hpsgc are involved in sugar signaling and subsequent related phosphatase pathways. din <dig> is a dark inducible responsive to sugar starvation  <cit> . din <dig> transcript is increased in the absence of type  <dig> and 2a protein phosphatases  <cit> . though technically a metallo-phosphoesterase and a type  <dig> acid phosphatase, pap <dig> is a member of the hpsgc and may be involved in similar signaling pathways  <cit> . miox <dig> is suppressed in the shoot by exogenous application of glucose, which my influence root expression through insp <dig> signaling cascades  <cit> , which itself plays a role in response to gravitropic stimuli  <cit> . sen <dig> is another gene induced in roots by phosphate starvation and induced in leaves by a glucose transport inhibitor  <cit> . sen <dig> itself may provide a link between glucose signaling and phosphate signaling  <cit> , and is highly expressed in the meristematic zone of the root  <cit> .

salt signaling is another functional group identified in the hpsgc. hkt <dig> has a role in salt signaling in arabidopsis roots  <cit> , and is likely involved in loading sodium ions into phloem to transport to roots, indirectly regulating potassium ion concentrations  <cit> . hkt <dig> activity is reduced by high calcium levels  <cit> , which could point to a crosstalk linkage point between calcium and salt signaling pathways. sis also has a role in salt tolerance, but is mostly unknown at this time  <cit> . some of these salt-related genes are present in root regions that would imply signaling activity and growth determination. for example, din <dig> is present in the columella cells and stele of roots under salt stress, while sis is present in the epidermis, lateral root cap, cortex, and partially present in the endodermis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work investigated the transcriptional differences between skewing and non-skewing roots. comparisons within ws revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth  during the process of skewing. these genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the ws and col- <dig> genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. a majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates  are directly associated with environmental sensing , upstream of physical growth differences . thus, pathways that respond to disparate signals from the root local environment may drive the root behavior of skewing. however, it is also possible that some of the hpsgc are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. in order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the hpsgc to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contributing to root skewing.
