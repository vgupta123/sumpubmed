BACKGROUND
the hiv- <dig> group m epidemic started to spread in kinshasa  long before the identification of the first aids cases in western countries  <cit> . while still confined to central africa, the hiv- <dig> group m diversified into several lineages known nowadays as subtypes  and inter-subtype recombinant forms  <cit> . recombinants between hiv- <dig> subtypes are designated as circulating recombinant forms  if the variant is found in at least three individuals with no direct epidemiological linkage, and, if the crf is composed by sequences originating from more than two subtypes, it is classified as complex  <cit> . the crfs are increasingly becoming relevant to the hiv- <dig> epidemic, since the global proportion of all crfs combined increased from  <dig> % in 2000– <dig> to 16% in 2004– <dig>  <cit> .

some of the complex crfs  carry fragments of rare subtypes  and divergent unclassified  lineages likely derived from parental strains that may predate the current subtypes  <cit> . some of these complex crfs are widely dispersed in a given african region and reaching particularly high prevalence  in certain countries, such as the crf06_cpx in burkina faso  <cit>  and the crf11_cpx in the central african republic  <cit> . others complex crfs circulate at a very low prevalence  throughout several countries from west   and central   africa. the remaining of those complex crfs were sporadically detected in africa, but have successfully disseminated to other locations, as the crf04_cpx in greece and cyprus  <cit>  and the crf18_cpx in cuba  <cit> .

information about the time-scale, migration routes and population dynamics of those complex crfs  are scarce. previous studies conducted by our group support that the crf06_cpx epidemic in west africa probably originated from the regional dissemination of a single founder strain introduced in burkina faso around the late 1970s  <cit> , while the crf18_cpx epidemic in cuba probably resulted from the local expansion of a single founder strain introduced in the country at the early 1990s  <cit> . although these estimates supports a relative recent origin for crf06_cpx and crf18_cpx epidemics in west africa and cuba, these and other crfs_cpx carrying fragments of rare subtypes and u lineages probably arose in central africa several years earlier. the precise onset dates of the crfs_cpx clades at the epicenter, however, remain largely unknown.

in the present study, we reconstructed the time-scale of the crfs 09_cpx, 11_cpx, 13_cpx and 45_cpx as well as the spatial and demographic dissemination dynamics of the crf11_cpx, by using two comprehensive data sets of hiv- <dig> pol  and env  sequences sampled in central and west africa over a period of  <dig> years.

methods
hiv- <dig> crfs_cpx sequences datasets
all crf09_cpx, crf11_cpx, crf13_cpx and crf45_cpx  sequences with information about country of origin and sampling date were retrieved from the los alamos hiv sequence database . the sequences covered the entire protease and partial reverse transcriptase  regions of pol gene corresponding to hxb <dig> coordinates  <dig> to  <dig> , and the v <dig> region of the env-gp <dig> gene corresponding to hxb <dig> coordinates  <dig> to  <dig> . all sequences of the crfs09/11/13/45_cpx’s parental subtypes  from central and west african countries were also retrieved from los alamos hivdb and included in the final datasets. sequences were aligned using clustal x v. <dig> program  <cit> , followed by manual editing.

genetic classification of hiv- <dig> crfs_cpx
the subtype classification of all pol and env sequences here included was initially verified with rega hiv subtyping tool v. <dig>  <cit>  and comet v. <dig>  <cit>  and further confirmed by maximum likelihood  phylogenetic and bootscanning analysis. the ml tree was inferred with phyml program  <cit>  using an online web server  <cit>  under the gtr + i + Γ <dig> nucleotide substitution model selected using the jmodeltest v. <dig> program, and the spr branch-swapping algorithm for heuristic tree search. the consistency of the tree topology was estimated with approximate likelihood-ratio test  <cit>  based on a shimodaira-hasegawa-like procedure . all crfs_cpx sequences were inspected to verify if their mosaic profile were the expected according to the published crf breakpoint locations in the los alamos hivdb database  by bootscanning analysis using simplot software v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . bootstrap values supporting branching of query and reference sequences were determined by neighbor-joining trees constructed using the kimura two-parameter model based on  <dig> re-samplings, with a  <dig> bp sliding window moving in steps of  <dig> bases.

evolutionary analyses
the phylogenetic tree, evolutionary rate  and the age of the most recent common ancestor  of hiv- <dig> crfs09/11/13/45_cpx epidemics circulating in central and west african regions were jointly estimated using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo  approach implemented in beast v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  along with beagle v <dig>  library to perform parallelization  <cit> . analyzes were performed using the gtr + i + Γ <dig> nucleotide substitution model, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model  <cit>  with informative substitution rate priors for the pol  and env   <cit>  genomic regions, and a bayesian skyline coalescent tree prior  <cit> . mcmc chains were run for 108generations and adequate chain mixing was checked, after excluding an initial 10% burn-in for each run, by calculating the effective sample size  using tracer v <dig>  program  <cit> . maximum clade credibility  trees were summarized from the posterior distribution of trees with treeannotator and visualized with figtree v <dig>   <cit> .

phylogeographic and demographic analyses
the spatiotemporal and demographic dynamics of dissemination of the hiv- <dig> crf11_cpx clade were reconstructed using beast v <dig> . <dig> as previously described. migration events throughout the pol and env phylogenetic history were reconstructed by applying a reversible discrete bayesian phylogeographic model  <cit>  and a continuous-time markov chain rate reference prior  <cit>  and latter summarized using the spread v. <dig> . <dig> application  <cit> . the effective population size through time was initially estimated using a bayesian skyline coalescent model  <cit>  and estimates of the population growth rate were subsequently obtained using different parametric models   <cit> . the fittest model to the demographic signal contained in crf11_cpx pol and env dataset was chosen after model comparison using the log marginal likelihood estimation based on path sampling  and stepping-stone sampling  methods  <cit> . mcmc chains were run for  <dig> generations and adequate chain mixing was checked as previously described. graphical representations of the effective number of infections through time were generated by programs tracer v <dig>   <cit>  and graphpad prism  <dig> .

RESULTS
selection of hiv- <dig> crfs_cpx pol and env sequences
most crfs_cpx-like pol  and env  sequences obtained from los alamos hivdb were correctly genotyped since displayed the same mosaic structures  and branched in highly supported monophyletic clades  with corresponding crfs_cpx reference sequences. these analyses also identified  <dig> sequences erroneously classified and misannotated in the los alamos hivdb . two pol sequences incorrectly annotated as subtype j and crf11_cpx were reclassified as crf11_cpx and crf13_cpx, respectively . one crf09_cpx env sequence branched within the crf11_cpx clade, while  <dig> subtype a/a1/a <dig> env sequences branched within the crfs09/11/13/45_cpx clades radiations and were thus reclassified accordingly . this approach resulted in two final datasets composed by  <dig> crfs_cpx-like pol sequences and  <dig> crfs_cpx-like env sequences, sampled between  <dig> and  <dig> from  <dig> countries of central and west africa  that were used for the subsequent analyses.

the ml env phylogenetic tree also allowed drawing inferences about the evolutionary origin of the parental viruses that originated the crfs_cpx, once it was reconstructed from a common subtype a genomic segment. the subtype a segments of crf11_cpx and crf13_cpx lineages form a highly supported cluster  within the subtype a/a <dig> radiation that also comprised  <dig> basal sequences originated almost exclusively from central africa . in contrast, the subtype a segments of crf09_cpx and crf45_cpx lineages branched outside the subtype a/a <dig> radiation as very early divergent lineages. two sequences from the drc branched basally to the crf45_cpx clade , whereas no basal sequences to the crf09_cpx clade were identified. the a/a <dig> env sequences from central africa that clustered basally to the crfs_cpx clades with high support  were combined with the crfs09/11/13/45_cpx dataset to aid bayesian evolutionary and temporal analyses.

time-scale of hiv- <dig> crfs_cpx clades
bayesian analyses of both pol and env datasets confirmed that all sequences from a given crfs_cpx formed highly supported monophyletic clades   with an overall weak geographic structure . the median evolutionary rate calculated under a relaxed molecular clock model was  <dig>  × 10− <dig> subst./site/year for pol gene and  <dig>  × 10−3subst./site/year for env gene. the coefficient of rate variation for both genes was significantly higher than zero , thus supporting the use of a relaxed molecular clock model. the median tmrca obtained from both hiv- <dig> datasets point to quite consistent onset dates for the crf09_cpx , crf11_cpx  and crf13_cpx  clades . a slightly younger median tmrca for the crf45_cpx clade was obtained for pol  than for env  datasets. this can be probably attributed to the much smaller sample size of the crf45_cpx-like pol dataset  when compared to the env dataset .fig.  <dig> time-scaled bayesian mcc tree of the hiv- <dig> crfs09/11/13/45_cpx pol gene fragment. branch color indicates the subtype classification obtained in this study, according to the legend in top left. the external circular segments highlight the position of each specific clade as indicated at the line. asterisks point to key nodes with a high  pp support. branch lengths are drawn to scale with the concentric circles indicating years. the tree was automatically rooted under the assumption of a relaxed molecular clock

spatial and demographic dissemination dynamics of the crf11_cpx clade
phylogeographic and demographic reconstructions were only performed for the crf11_cpx clade, since it was the only one that comprised a number of pol and env sequences large enough  to provide accurate estimates.

the evolutionary parameters obtained from both crf11_cpx datasets were almost identical to those estimated from the combined crfs09/11/13/45_cpx datasets . the patterns of viral migration across time reconstructed from both pol and env phylogenies were very similar and indicated that the crf11_cpx clade most probably emerged in cameroon  around the early 1960s . from cameroon, the crf11_cpx was first disseminated to chad and the central african republic between  <dig> and  <dig>  and to other neighboring central  and west  african countries from the early 1980s onwards. secondary disseminations of the crf11_cpx from the central african republic to cameroon/gabon and from chad to cameroon were also recovered by the pol and env datasets, respectively.table  <dig> bayesian estimates of evolutionary and population dynamic parameters of the hiv- <dig> crf11_cpx clade

the changes in the effective population size  of the crf11_cpx clade over time estimated from both pol and env datasets were also very similar. the bayesian skyline plot  coalescent analysis indicated that the crf11_cpx clade experienced an initial phase of exponential growth, followed by a decline in growth rate from the mid-1980s . consistent with this result, the logistic growth model was pointed as the best-fit parametric demographic model  by both ps and ss methods  and then it was used to estimate the epidemic growth rate of the crf11_cpx epidemic in central africa. according to the logistic growth coalescent model, the crf11_cpx expanded between  <dig> and  <dig> with a median growth rate of  <dig>  year− <dig>  and  <dig>  year− <dig>  .fig.  <dig> demographic history of the hiv- <dig> crf11_cpx epidemic. non-parametric estimates of effective number of infections through time of the hiv- <dig> crf11_cpx epidemic in pol  and env  datasets are represented by bayesian skyline plots. demographic history of hiv- <dig> crf11_cpx epidemic based on pol  and env  datasets were reconstructed using a logistic growth coalescent model. median estimate of the effective number of infections  and 95% confidence limits of the estimate  are shown. vertical axes indicate the estimated effective number of infections and were represented on logarithmic scale. time scale is in calendar years




discussion
the pervasive recombination of the hiv- <dig> at the early stages of the group m epidemic generated a large array of complex crfs at the epicenter in central africa that usually circulates at low prevalence . in this study, we compile a quite large number of hiv- <dig> pol and env sequences from four complex recombinants  displaying unique mosaic structures in pol and a common subtype a fragment in env and estimate their onset dates. most crfs_cpx-like pol sequences used here were correctly annotated in the los alamos hivdb. a significant fraction  of the crfs_cpx-like env sequences here recovered, by contrast, corresponded to west and central african sequences originally classified as subtype a/a1/a <dig>  but that clearly branched within the crfs_cpx radiations and should be thus reclassified.

the inspection of the env ml and bayesian phylogenetic trees revealed that the subtype a env segments that originated the ancestors of crf11_cpx and crf13_cpx seems to have derived from a common lineage that currently circulates in drc and congo. other interesting observation was that while subtype a env segment of crf11_cpx and crf13_cpx fall within the subtype a/a <dig> radiation, the subtype a env segments of crf09_cpx and crf45_cpx branched as early divergent lineages basally to the root of subtype a/a <dig>  this observation is consistent with the notion that crf09_cpx and crf45_cpx likely originated from viruses that diverged close to  the time of the hiv- <dig> subtype a progenitor  <cit> . our results also points that some of these early divergent lineages are still circulating in the drc, once two hiv- <dig> subtype a-like sequences from that country branched basally to the crf45_cpx clade. the contributions of these lineages to the genesis of some crfs indicate that they had epidemiological relevance during the early stages of the hiv- <dig> group m epidemic  <cit> .

it was suggested that the low frequencies of many ancient hiv- <dig> divergent lineages in the human population was caused by its absence during the initial migratory wave of variants that triggered the global epidemic  <cit> . similarly, the overall low prevalence of the crfs_cpx lineages carrying fragments of those ancient may reflect a later emergence of these variants when compared to more prevalent hiv- <dig> subtypes and crfs. the evolutionary analyses performed here, however, support that complex crfs probably started to circulate in central africa between the late 1950s and the late 1960s, which coincides with the estimated onset date of several prevalent hiv- <dig> group m clades including: subtype a <dig>   <cit> , subtype c   <cit> , subtype f <dig>   <cit> , subtype g   <cit> , the crf01_ae   <cit> , and the crf02_ag   <cit> . the estimated tmrca also overlaps with a period of demographic transition of the hiv- <dig> group m in the drc around  <dig> , from an early phase of relatively slow exponential growth to a second phase of faster exponential growth  <cit> . thus, the early establishment of most hiv- <dig> group m subtypes and crfs in the drc was probably shaped by the same factors and occurred at around the same time, despite significant disparities in their final epidemic outcomes.

alternatively, the current low prevalence of many ancient hiv- <dig> divergent lineages and crfs_cpx lineages may reveals a lower transmissibility of those variants when compared with the globally circulating hiv- <dig> clades  <cit> . some evidences, however, also argued against this hypothesis. first, the crf06_cpx and crf11_cpx clades comprise a large fraction  of hiv- <dig> infections in burkina faso  <cit>  and the central african republic  <cit> , respectively, and the crf18_cpx was successfully disseminated in cuba  <cit> . second, coalescent estimations of the exponential growth rates of the crf06_cpx  and crf18_cpx  clades in west africa  <cit>  and cuba  <cit> , respectively, were similar to that estimated for highly prevalent hiv- <dig> lineages including: subtype b in western countries  , subtype c in brazil   <cit> , and subtype g  and crf02_ag  in west africa  <cit> . these observations demonstrate that, in specific settings, the crfs_cpx clades were able to seed large epidemics and to spread at rates comparable to the most prevalent hiv- <dig> group m clades.

our demographic reconstructions also indicate that the epidemic growth rate seems to vary for different crfs_cpx. according to our estimations, the crf11_cpx expanded in central africa between  <dig> and  <dig> with a median growth rate of ~ <dig>  year− <dig> , a value significantly lower than that estimated for the crf06_cpx and crf18_cpx epidemics in west africa and cuba, respectively. the epidemic growth rate of the crf11_cpx, however, was comparable to that estimated for some subtype g  and crf02_ag  clades circulating in cameroon  <cit>  and to that estimated for the hiv- <dig> group m  in the drc during 1960– <dig>  <cit> . we propose that differences in epidemic growth rates across hiv- <dig> african lineages most probably resulted from ecological determinants, although differences in viral transmissibility properties might be also responsible for the growth rate variances in some cases  <cit> .

spatial accessibility has been pointed as a major driving force of hiv- <dig> spread within africa, and the central african region displayed a much lower spatial connectivity than western, eastern, and southern sub-saharan regions  <cit> . the crf06_cpx clade most probably entered in burkina faso and from there was disseminated to other neighboring western african countries  <cit> . according to our phylogeographic reconstructions, the epicenter and most important hub of dissemination of the crf11_cpx clade was cameroon, from where the virus spread to neighboring central african countries . thus, the dissemination of the crf06_cpx clade took place in a geographic region much better connected than the region of dissemination of the crf11_cpx clade, which may have contributed to the faster epidemic growth rate of the crf06_cpx when compared to the crf11_cpx.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that hiv- <dig> crfs_cpx clades were already circulating in central africa before the late 1960s and probably arose at around the same time than other more prevalent hiv- <dig> group m lineages. cameroon was traced as the most probable epicenter of crf11_cpx dissemination in central africa and the demographic history of this crf was roughly comparable to that described for other central african hiv- <dig> group m lineages. these results support that the final prevalence of the different hiv- <dig> group m lineages circulating in human populations was mainly determined by stochastic and ecological factors, rather than by differences in the precise onset date of viral lineages. this study offers important insights toward an understanding of the epidemic potential and current dissemination pattern of some rare hiv- <dig> group m clades.
