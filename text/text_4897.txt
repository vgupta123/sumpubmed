BACKGROUND
the genus phytophthora, with other oomycetes, fall within the kingdom stramenopila, which also includes golden-brown algae, diatoms, and brown algae such as kelp  <cit> . this genus stands out among the plant pathogens since a significant number of the  <dig> or so described species continue to prove a threat to ecosystem stability and plant productivity on a global scale  <cit> . despite the importance of phytophthora species, studies of their molecular diversity have been limited by the power of the genetic markers and difficulties in comparing results among laboratories. accurate studies based on the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear dna have resulted in a consensus of the phylogenetic relationships within the genus with a grouping into  <dig> genetically related clades now accepted  <cit> . however, these studies were based on genes commonly conserved within a species and therefore unsuitable to characterize intraspecific variability. other approaches to study intraspecific variability among phytophthora species including rapd-pcr and aflp have proved valuable within a particular study but comparing results from one laboratory to another has always proved challenging with such fingerprinting tools  <cit> . although microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  have been recognised as one of the most powerful choices of markers for molecular ecology they have only relatively recently been exploited in the study of phytophthora populations. ssrs are tandemly repeated motifs of one to six bases which occur frequently and randomly in all eukaryotic genomes although their frequency varies significantly among different organisms  <cit> . they exhibit a high degree of length polymorphism among related organisms due to stepwise mutations affecting the number of repeat units and leading to polymorphism  <cit> . dinucleotide repeats account for the majority of microsatellites for many species whereas trinucleotide and hexanucleotide repeats are the most likely repeat classes to appear in coding regions because they do not cause a frameshift  <cit> . major advantages ssrs include:  multiple ssr alleles may be detected at a single locus using a simple pcr-based screen,  ssrs are evenly distributed across the genome,  they are co-dominant,  very small quantities of dna are required for screening,  analysis may be semi-automated, and  results are objective compared to random amplification methods  <cit> .

microsatellites have been used to investigate genetic structure and reproductive biology of oomycetes species including plasmopara viticola, p. cinnamomi, p. infestans, and p. ramorum  <cit> . however, a major limitation to their wider exploitation is the need for prior species-specific marker isolation that requires knowledge of the dna sequence of the ssr flanking regions to which specific primers have to be designed. such regions are usually conserved within a species but the likelihood of primers successfully working between species decreases with increasing genetic distance and, in practice, primers are usually developed anew for each species  <cit> . common methods for the discovery of ssr loci are based on constructing genomic dna libraries enriched for ssr sequences. these methods were utilised for p. cinnamomi and p. ramorum, however they are time-consuming, and the specific sequencing of dna libraries required is expensive  <cit> . many commercial and academic laboratories specialise in microsatellite isolation services and can provide a set of polymorphic microsatellite loci for a new species in 3– <dig> months for a cost of approximately usd  <dig>  per locus, or usd  <dig>  for 10– <dig> loci  <cit> .

the availability of entire genome sequences for an increasing number of species including p. infestans , p. ramorum and p. sojae  have proved novel opportunities to identify and evaluate potential ssr markers identified by computational tools   <cit> . this approach has been utilised to identify ssrs for the study of european and usa populations of p. ramorum and for monitoring the genetic variation in populations of p. infestans across europe and worldwide  <cit> .

recently, garnica et al. used an in silico approach to survey and compare simple sequence repeats  in transcript sequences from the genomes of p. sojae, p. ramorum and p. infestans  <cit> . they also evaluated in silico transferability of ssrs among the phytophthora species and found that a proportion  of primers could, in theory, be transferred between at least two of the three species. in the present study ssrs from p. infestans p. sojae and p. ramorum were analysed to identify useful loci common to many phytophthora species  or to a restricted number of species closely related to p. sojae . selected loci were amplified and sequenced from  <dig>  and  <dig>  different phytophthora species and a comprehensive ssrs dataset was created.

RESULTS
approach  <dig> – ssrs for many phytophthora species
the aim of this approach was to identify loci containing ssrs common to a large number of phytophthora species . the method was validated using  <dig> different species  representing the breadth of diversity across the genus  <cit> .

analysis of sequences from p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum genome projects and scanning for homologous ssrs
predicted gene datasets from p. infestans p. sojae and p. ramorum  were scanned for the presence of microsatellites defined as short tandem repeat motifs  of 2– <dig> bp. both perfect and compound ssrs were selected with a minimal acceptable length of  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp . ssrs with a minimum of three repeats were included in the analyses of penta-nucleotide repeats. this search yielded  <dig> sequences containing ssrs . the relative abundance of ssrs was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> per mb of predicted gene sequence for p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum, respectively.

selected regions were compared by blast analysis to identify homologous regions flanking ssrs in at least two of the three species . this analysis identified  <dig> ssrs from p. infestans , p. ramorum , and p. sojae . a very limited number of loci containing ssrs were common to the three species; most loci were common to p. ramorum and p. sojae , p. infestans and p. ramorum  or p. infestans and p. sojae . in most of the cases, homologous loci contained the same ssr motif in different phytophthoras, however the number of repeats was consistently higher in the 'source' species than the other two.

among the selected loci, the number of ssr repeats ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  from  <dig> to  <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig> in p. infestans, p. ramorum and p. sojae respectively. most ssrs showed seven repeats or less , with a repeat number of four being the most common in all species.

selection and amplification of target regions containing ssrs
the  <dig> homologous regions previously identified were manually analysed to select those with the highest number of repeats and flanked by the most conserved sequences on both sides. the latter condition was necessary to design primers suitable for as many species as possible. based on this analysis  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> target regions were identified across the genome of p. infestans, p. ramorum and p. sojae respectively. these regions, containing  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ssrs respectively, were selected  for amplification from  <dig> different species of phytophthora representing the breadth of diversity in the genus . to this aim, a total number of  <dig> different degenerate primers  were designed . when target regions contained two or more ssrs and/or were too long to be amplified by a single amplification, a pool of different primers was designed . considerable effort was made to obtain successful amplification from as many species as possible. this involved screening of several primer pairs for each genomic region and for each phytophthora species  and adjustment of annealing temperatures and mgcl <dig> concentration for pcr reactions .

 = primers are listed according to the localization in their respective genome projects  and according to the flanked ssrs. in some circumstances, a pool of different primers was designed to amplify selected genomic regions from as many as possible phytophthora species. similarly, when target regions contained two or more ssrs and were too long to be amplified by a single amplification a pool of different primers was designed.

the resultant primers enabled the amplification of  <dig> single pcr bands of the expected size . in the remaining primer-species combinations,  <dig> amplifications did not produce any product or produced complex profiles  impeding direct sequencing . some primer combinations failed to amplify a product from any of the phytophthora species whereas other combinations amplified single bands from all or most phytophthora species .

sequencing of single pcr bands and scanning for ssrs
all single pcr bands  were purified to remove excess primers and nucleotides and sequenced in both directions using the same primers used for the amplification. when forward and/or reverse sequences were not identical, amplification, purification and sequencing were repeated twice and all unreliable sequences were discarded. finally,  <dig> sequences were obtained with primers designed against p. sojae , p. ramorum  and p. infestans  genomes  and scanned to identify ssrs by means of sputnik. sequenced regions contained a total number of  <dig> ssrs distributed across the genome of the  <dig> target species with those of clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig>  more highly represented . a single microsatellite was identified in p. inundata. all ssrs identified in p. infestans were amplified with primers designed against its own genome . identified ssrs ranged in the number of repeats from  <dig> to  <dig>  from  <dig> to  <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig> in p. sojae, p. ramorum and p. infestans respectively . a single repeat of  <dig> was found in an scri isolate of p. ramorum . most ssrs were of seven repeats or less , with a repeat number of four being the most common in all species . overall, the most common motifs were n, n and n representing  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively of the total number of identified ssrs . trinucleotide repeats were the most common  followed by pentanucleotide , tetranucleotide  and dinucleotide  repeats.

to evaluate intraspecific variability a few selected target regions amplified by primers s23f-s25r, s21f-s22r, i9-i <dig> and i5- <dig>  were examined and sequenced from additional isolates of p. alni, p. cambivora, p. cinnamomi, p. pseudosyringae and p. ilicis . the analysed target regions did not show intraspecific variability among analysed isolates of p. alni subsp. alni, p. pseudosyringae or p. ilicis, whereas p. cambivora and p. cinnamomi isolates were polymorphic in all the tested primer combinations. as an example, the target region amplified with primers i9-i <dig> from p. cinnamomi was characterised by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> repeated motifs  in three tested isolates .

approach  <dig> – identification of ssrs in phytophthora spp. clade 7
the aim of this approach was to focus the search for ssr loci to a restricted range of four clade  <dig> phytophthora species  phylogenetically related to p. sojae   <cit> .

identification of target regions
this approach was based on a detailed list of ssrs identified in the genome of p. sojae and provided by dr. niklaus grunwald at the agricultural research service, u.s. department of agriculture, corvallis, oregon. among the list, sixty genomic regions  were manually selected on the basis of having the longest ssrs in exons , introns  and non coding regions . the selected regions  were screened using blast against the entire genomes of p. ramorum and p. infestans to search for homology irrespective of the ssr regions. none of these regions aligned with sequences from the p. infestans genome whereas  <dig> of the  <dig> regions were sufficiently conserved to match homologous genes in p. ramorum . surprisingly none of these  <dig> regions contained ssrs in p. ramorum, however it was hypothesised that microsatellites could be present in homologous regions of other phytophthora species more closely related to p. sojae. to verify this hypothesis, thirty-six primers  were designed in the conserved flanking regions and used to amplify the target regions from p. alni, p. cambivora, p. europaea, p. fragariae and an scri isolate of p. sojae . degenerate primers were designed when necessary.

discussion
the present study was undertaken to develop a method to rapidly identify loci containing ssrs and to create a pool of microsatellite markers for species of the genus phytophthora taking advantage of publicly available sequences for p. sojae, p. ramorum and p. infestans. recently, garnica et al. explored the transferability of microsatellites across p. sojae, p. ramorum and p. infestans via an in silico virtual pcr approach  <cit> . in the present study, such an analysis on the same three species was conducted but also followed up with a comprehensive screening and validation process on multiple species to provide a practical evaluation of the procedure as a means of accelerating the search for new ssr markers in the genus phytophthora.

the first approach was aimed at the identification of informative ssr loci common to many phytophthora species. this approach was based on the hypothesis that among the large number of microsatellites distributed across the genome of species of the genus there may be a proportion in genes common to many species with sufficient sequence conservation in flanking regions to allow the design and use of universal ssr primers. our search of the predicted gene sets yielded approximately 10% fewer ssrs and a corresponding lower abundance of ssrs per mb of sequence than that of garnica et al  <cit> . preliminary analyses revealed a very limited number of loci containing ssrs that were common to the three phytophthora species tested. the majority of the identified loci  were common to p. sojae and p. ramorum only which is consistent with their closer phylogenetic relationship in clades  <dig> and  <dig> than to p. infestans in clade  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, garnica et al. found in their in silico analysis that  <dig> % of their primers were, in theory, transferable between at least two species  and only  <dig> % transferable between the three species  <cit> . among the selected sequences satisfying the above conditions, the number of repeats ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and most ssrs showed seven repeats or less, with a repeat number of four being the most common in all species. the abundance of different repeat motifs differed slightly between species however, on average, n, n and n were the most abundant triplets in all three phytophthoras . these results differ from those reported by garnica et al. in which n, n and n were the most abundant triplets amongst all the screened est sequences  <cit> . it should, however be considered that unlike the study of garnica our data are confined to ssr sequences for which it was possible to identify a homologue in at least one of the other two species. therefore it could be hypothesised that motifs n and n are more abundant in more conserved genes. the dominance of trinucleotide ssrs compared to dinucleotide ssrs was not surprising considering that trinucleotides are abundant in coding regions of all higher eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . dinucleotide repeats, in contrast, are characterised by higher mutation rates which may explain their abundance in introns and non-coding regions and lower frequency in coding regions, which cannot tolerate frame-shift mutations  <cit> .

primers designed in the present study with the first approach were tested against a panel of  <dig> different phytophthora species representing the breadth of diversity across the genus to amplify p. sojae, p. ramorum and p. infestans target regions containing  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ssrs respectively. overall, these primers enabled the sequencing of  <dig> target regions which contained  <dig> ssrs ranging in repeat number from  <dig> to  <dig>  most of these ssrs showed seven repeats or less with four the most common repeat number and n, n and n the most common motifs. trinucleotide repeats were dominant followed by pentanucleotide, tetranucleotide and dinucleotide repeats. this data indicate that such an approach can be useful to identify cross-specific ssr loci in the genus phytophthora. as further genome sequences become available, for example, p. capsici , the process can be refined to specific subsets of the genus. the mutation rates and, consequently, the practical utility of the identified ssrs in the study of the specific phytophthora species need to be examined further. undoubtedly, a risk of this approach is that the selection is biased towards more conserved sequences which may subsequently have a lower mutation rate that reduces their utility as polymorphic markers. furthermore, the fact that p. infestans ssrs were all identified using primers designed on its own genome  may indicate that this approach is less appropriate for distant relatives considering that, as stated above, p. infestans is phylogenetically distant from p. sojae and p. ramorum. however, the identification of intraspecific polymorphisms in some selected ssrs is encouraging and demonstrates that at least some of the selected ssrs are valuable for immediate practical applications . this is consistent with the reported applicability of est-ssrs across closely related taxa in other organisms as well as phytophthora  <cit> . in the present study, the focus on the breadth of species  prevented the analyses of a wider number of target regions. however, the same method could be easily applied to the study of more regions from one or a few species.

the application of the first method enabled the identification of novel ssrs from all the  <dig> target species with those of clade  <dig> and  <dig> more highly represented . a higher proportion of ssrs from species of the clade  <dig> and  <dig> was expected considering that p. sojae and p. ramorum belong to these two clades  <cit> . in light of this fact, a second approach to identify a greater number of polymorphic ssrs from within a more limited range of clade  <dig> taxa more closely related to p. sojae was investigated. sixty p. sojae ssr candidates were compared by blast analysis against the complete genome sequence of the other two species yielding  <dig> ssr candidates which could be aligned with homologous regions in p. ramorum. however in none of these  <dig> candidates  was the ssr maintained in p. ramorum. in four of the more closely related species , however, some of the ssr regions were conserved . in this study the focus was on discovery of ssrs in invasive forest phytophthora species within the clade 7a, perhaps a higher success rate in marker discovery would have followed a search amongst the closest related species in clade 7b   <cit> . although a few ssr markers with potential were discovered using this approach, it was not a highly efficient means of identifying new polymorphic ssr loci and highlights the lack of conservation of ssr loci, even amongst coding regions within a single its clade of phytophthora. some degree of cross-species amplification has been observed between ssrs in p. infestans with other clade 1c taxa and it is therefore likely that a wider application of this method concentrated on the closest relatives would be more productive  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has tested two different methods to generate ssr markers that can be utilised across a broad range of phytophthora species. the final number of identified loci for any single species may not be sufficient to run a complete population genetics analysis and key studies on the inter- and intraspecific variation remain. a comprehensive dataset of candidate ssrs from a range of species has been created . the detailed groundwork needed to amplify these regions from such a diverse collection of species and target regions has been completed which moves beyond the previous in silico approach to improve our understanding of the range and sequence conservation of ssr loci amongst species  <cit> . in general, the level of interspecific ssr sequence conservation, even amongst more closely related species within a single clade, was low and the method may not be the most efficient means of identifying novel ssr loci. apart from their application as molecular markers, determining the abundance and density of ssrs in oomycetes may help understand whether these sequences have any functional and evolutionary significance  <cit> . furthermore, irrespective of the microsatellites, some of the amplified regions represent valuable marker regions for a number of applications  <cit> . a single optimal target gene for all phytophthora species and assay requirements is unlikely to exist, therefore the continued identification and characterization of new target genes offers new opportunities for detection and phylogenetic studies  <cit> .
