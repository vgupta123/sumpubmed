BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains the leading cause of mortality due to a bacterial pathogen worldwide. the causative agent of tb, mycobacterium tuberculosis , infects approximately one third of the world’s human population  <cit> . the main route of mtb infection is from the respiratory tract to the lung. after entering the lung, the first immune cell type encountered by the bacteria is the alveolar macrophage. mtb has an extraordinary ability to persist and replicate inside the macrophages, which represent a hostile environment where most other pathogens perish. this ability is a prerequisite for mtb to maintain infection. during latency, mtb is viable but non-replicating and the bacteria are confined to granulomas  <cit> . the granuloma is a unique ecosystem where mtb growth remains most of the time in balance with host antibacterial effector mechanisms  <cit> .

after phagocytosis, mtb experiences endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress  <cit> . the endogenous stress is the result of the incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen during aerobic respiration while the exogenous stress is due to the oxidative burst generated by nadph oxidase in the phagosome  <cit> . the reactive oxygen species  that are created in these processes include peroxides, hydroxyl radicals and superoxide. in the macrophage, mtb also faces nitrosative stress from reactive nitrogen species , such as nitric oxide, nitrite, nitrogen dioxide and nitrates  <cit> . ros and rns can be bactericidal as they react with a wide range of macromolecules, like nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates . the tubercle bacillus counteracts the effects of ros and rns by producing several enzymes, including catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and nitrosothiol reductase, to ensure its intracellular survival and persistence  <cit> .

dna double strand breaks  are critical lesions that can result in cell death or a wide variety of genetic alterations. in mycobacteria, dsbs are repaired by three distinct repair mechanisms. these are homologous recombination , dependent on adnab nucleases and reca, non-homologous end-joining , involving ku and ligd  <cit> , and single strand annealing , which is achieved through recbcd in a reca-independent manner  <cit> .

regulatory non-coding rnas  play important roles in bacterial gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . they are functional rna molecules that are not translated into proteins. they usually have a length of 50– <dig> nucleotides and base-pair with mrna to regulate mrna stability or the efficiency of mrna translation  <cit> . ncrnas can be 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions , antisense or cis-encoded small rnas, and intergenic or trans-encoded transcripts  <cit> . most ncrnas regulate gene expression and can provide a quick response to changing environmental conditions such as genotoxic stress, nutrient deprivation or infection . studies on infectious processes have demonstrated that ncrnas can coordinate precise gene expression and thus play an important role in microbial pathogenesis  <cit> . while the number of characterised ncrnas steadily increases, only a limited number of the corresponding mrna targets have been identified.

until now, only a few studies reported on the global mycobacterial responses to genotoxic stress  <cit>  and, to our knowledge, there were no reports addressing the complexity of the mycobacterial response to several forms of genotoxic stress. our main goal in this study was to explore the mtb responses to various forms of genotoxic stress conditions by analysing the whole transcriptome. mtb responses to oxidative agents  and the nitrosative agent diethylenetriamine nitric oxide adduct  were investigated. as one of the cellular consequences of nitrosative stress is alkylation and thereby damage of the dna, we also investigated the response of mtb to the alkylating agent methylnitronitrosoguanidine . furthermore, we studied the transcriptomic response of mtb to mitomycin c , a substance known to induce dna cross-linking leading to dsbs  <cit> . in addition to identifying the de genes encoding mrnas, this study aims to detect ncrna transcripts which are expressed under different stress conditions and to predict their potential target genes. this analysis will enable improved understanding of mtb regulatory networks that operate under various forms of genotoxic stress.

RESULTS
nitrosative stress induced the most prominent transcriptomic response
several de genes were identified for each genotoxic stress condition investigated. treatment of mtb with paraquat, h2o <dig> and mnng caused only the up-regulation of genes. oxidative stress generated by paraquat led to the up-regulation of five genes namely, katg, kmtr, rv <dig>  rv1405c, and mmsa . the genotoxic stresses exerted by h2o <dig>  mmc and deta/no on mtb led to more pronounced transcriptomic perturbations with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> de genes, respectively , while only two de genes, alka and ogt were detected under mnng treatment .fig.  <dig> volcano plots of differentially expressed  genes under five stress conditions. on the x-axis the changes in expression for all genes under stress condition compared to the unstressed condition for a paraquat, b h2o <dig>

up-regulation of  <dig> genes and the down-regulation of the rrs gene, encoding 16s rrna, and the two ncrnas mts <dig> and ssr were observed under mmc treatment . nitrosative stress in the form of deta/no resulted in the up-regulation of  <dig> genes and the down-regulation of  <dig> genes with fold changes ranging from + <dig> to - <dig> .

in order to validate the rna-seq data analysis, a small subset of the de genes identified from each genotoxic stress was selected based on the level of their expression fold change compared to the control. the expression levels were tested using quantitative real-time pcr  . the qpcr results confirmed the results from the deep sequencing approach .

involvement of 3r genes, the type vii secretion system, and pe/ppe genes in the genotoxic response
a clusters of orthologous group  analysis of the de genes from each genotoxic stress was carried out to identify any bias in gene-functional-category distribution. oxidative stress inflicted by h2o <dig> induced the expression of genes belonging to  <dig> cog categories . the top three of these categories includes replication, recombination and repair  genes , post-translational modifications, protein turnover and chaperones  and secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism  . among the  <dig> up-regulated genes due to the mmc treatment,  <dig> come under the cog l category . for the deta/no stress, the de genes were distributed in  <dig> cog categories whereby nine of them contained more down-regulated genes than up-regulated genes . the energy production and conversion category  included the most genes affected with  <dig> up- and 35- down-regulated genes . the two categories transcription  and signal transduction mechanisms  encompassed mostly up-regulated genes. the genes in the categories of nucleotide transport and metabolism  and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis  were mostly down-regulated. in cog k, genes encoding sigma factors and sos response genes were found to be de. the cell motility category  contained only  <dig> up-regulated genes. four out of these five genes belong to the pe/ppe family . furthermore, the de genes include members of the t7ss, namely ecca <dig>  eccc <dig>  eccd <dig>  eccd <dig> and ecce <dig>  interestingly, among the up-regulated genes, one transcription factor  was already predicted to regulate the expression of multiple genes  <cit> , including alkb, ruba and rubb, but also eccb <dig> eccb <dig>  eccb <dig>  and eccb <dig>  the proteins eccb <dig>  eccb <dig>  eccb <dig> and eccb <dig> are all part of the t7ss.fig.  <dig> classification of the differentially expressed  genes according to cog categories. histograms indicate the number of genes in each cog category. green colour corresponds to up-regulated genes while red colour corresponds to down-regulated genes. this classification is shown only for  h2o <dig>   mmc and  deta/no treatment as paraquat treatment gave only five de genes . cog categories:  energy production and conversion,  cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning,  amino acid transport and metabolism,  nucleotide transport and metabolism,  carbohydrate transport and metabolism,  coenzyme transport and metabolism,  lipid transport and metabolism,  transcription,  replication, recombination and repair,  cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis,  cell motility,  post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones,  secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism,  signal transduction mechanisms,  intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport,  defense mechanisms




among the de 3r genes, predominantly affected by mmc and deta/no treatments, are mostly genes that encode helicases, endonucleases and resolvases and have transcription fold changes ranging from - <dig> to + <dig> . the proteins encoded by these 3r genes are directly involved in genome maintenance.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed  3r genes under various forms of genotoxic stress. among all de expressed genes,  <dig> genes belong to the 3r category. the table a shows the 3r genes that were de under at least two genotoxic stresses. the tables b and c show the de genes under only one genotoxic stress. h2o <dig>  b mmc, c deta/no, d mnng




identification of new potential 3r genes
for all de genes annotated as coding for hps , we performed 3d structure predictions using phyre <dig>  <cit> . by considering only proteins modelled with more than 70 % identity and 30 % coverage, we detected proteins that are predicted to be hydrolases/endonucleases, metal binding proteins, and dna binding proteins. some proteins were predicted with a high level of confidence to contain a dna binding domain . for example, 3d structural modelling of the protein encoded by rv <dig>  that was up-regulated  <dig>  fold under mmc stress and  <dig>  fold under deta/no stress, suggests that it probably is a hydrolase/endonuclease.

clustering of de genes into transcription units
by analysing the distribution of de genes throughout the genome, we found that several de genes were organized in clusters, defined as at least two neighbouring genes according to their genomic location . genes in clusters may be part of the same transcriptional unit. no clusters were identified for the de genes detected in the sample from the paraquat treatment . regarding h2o <dig> stress,  <dig> clusters were identified corresponding to  <dig> de genes. the largest cluster  includes  <dig> genes  belonging to the secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism category . they are involved in the biosynthesis of mycobactin, a mycobacterial siderophore with high affinity for environmental iron  <cit> . of the  <dig> clusters identified for mmc treatment, nine of them contain 3r genes. the cluster  <dig> is the largest with  <dig> genes . among the  <dig> de genes due to the deta/no stress,  <dig>  of them were organized in clusters. the three biggest clusters, cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> include  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> de genes, respectively. the cluster  <dig> contains ribosomal binding proteins , the cluster  <dig> includes genes encoding for the subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase i  and the cluster  <dig> contains the genes encoding esx- <dig> and its secreted substrates. all genes in the cluster  <dig> and the cluster  <dig> were down-regulated and the genes in cluster  <dig> were up-regulated under nitrosative stress. the mbt genes were also found to be highly up-regulated under nitrosative stress . as already reported by yang and colleagues  <cit> , the two up-regulated genes alka and ogt due to mnng stress are located in one cluster . sigma factor binding site analysis in the 100 bp upstream of all  <dig> identified clusters revealed the presence of binding sites for sigb, sigc, sige and sigf. the most common was the sigb binding site, found for 21gene clusters, while the binding sites for the other sigma factors were only found once each .fig.  <dig> mapping of the fold change of each gene according to its genomic location. each dot corresponds to one gene. the x-axis corresponds to the genomic coordinates and the y-axis to the log <dig> fold change. significantly up-regulated genes are indicated with green dots while significantly down-regulated genes are indicated by red dots. a paraquat, b h2o <dig>  c mmc, d deta/no, and e mnng




potential role of ncrna for genotoxic stress response
thorough bioinformatics analysis of the sequencing data from the samples treated with h2o <dig> and paraquat,  <dig> and  <dig> ncrnas were predicted, respectively . out of these,  <dig> ncrnas were found under both oxidative stress conditions. only one ncrna was identified in the data from the mnng stressed sample. the data from the deta/no stressed samples revealed  <dig> ncrnas. from the  <dig> ncrnas identified in the data from the mmc stressed sample, we found  <dig> to be novel . among all the  <dig> ncrnas identified  <dig> were previously reported  . the length of the ncrnas varied between  <dig> and  <dig> bases. a subset of the identified ncrnas was experimentally verified by northern blot analyses confirming the predicted transcript sizes . by using intarna, the potential gene targets of the ncrnas were predicted. a total of  <dig> ncrnas were predicted to regulate  <dig> genes under paraquat , h2o <dig> , mmc  and deta/no  treatments  with  <dig> genes targeted by more than one ncrna.fig.  <dig> validation of selected ncrnas by northern blot. four newly discovered ncrnas  were randomly selected for northern blot validation. for each selected ncrna, the normalized coverage plots from rna-seq data of aligned reads is shown on the top with the genomic context identified from the mtb h37rv  genome and the position of the ncrna is indicated by coloured arrows. the coverage data is indicated with the following colours: no stress -black; h2o <dig> - red; mmc -blue; deta/no -green. rna samples for the northern blots are from the correspondent samples. control rna is from non-stressed cells. for each northern blot, the loading control  and decade marker are shown

discussion
in this study, we determined the transcriptomic responses of the mtb to various forms of genotoxic stress. our results show massive and complex gene regulation especially for the nitrosative stress inflicted by deta/no. alkylation damage due to mnng treatment led to the up-regulation of only two genes, alka and ogt that are part of the ada operon of mtb and this result corroborates a previous study  <cit> .

when facing oxidative stress by h2o <dig> or by paraquat, mtb responded differently in terms of the number of de genes. however, regarding the ncrnas,  <dig> ncrnas are common under both treatments. regarding gene regulation, the catalase-peroxidase gene katg was found to be the only common gene up-regulated under both treatments. this was also the case under nitrosative stress, confirming the importance of katg in stress responses  <cit> . the enzyme katg, together with the metalloenzyme kmtr, is involved in the oxidative stress response by playing a role in the detoxification of host-generated free radicals . in addition, fura is up-regulated under oxidative stress due to h2o <dig>  and nitrosative  stress conditions. both oxidizing treatments caused the up-regulation of genes that are mainly taken part in metal transport. the correlation between oxidative stress and expression of metal transport proteins has already been observed  <cit> . fura is known to be involved in iron homeostasis and stress response in many bacteria  <cit> . we suggest that fura might contribute as an oxidative stress sensing regulator. our observation of the up-regulation of mbt genes under both oxidative and nitrosative stress corroborate the study reported by voskuil and colleagues  <cit> . the mbt genes participate in the biosynthesis of the hydroxyphenyloxazoline-containing mycobactins, a class of siderophores involved in iron acquisition . iron homeostasis must be finely controlled as both excess and limitation of iron may cause oxidative stress . under normal conditions, the regulation of the siderophore biosynthesis genes is dependent on the iron concentration in the environment which is fluctuating due to a continuous oxidation/reduction of fe2+/fe3+  <cit> . the up-regulation of the mbt genes demonstrates that mtb is using this pathway to limit the oxidative stress damage by scavenging more iron from its environment. in addition, the genes mmps <dig>  mmps <dig>  mmpl3-l <dig>  whose products are needed to transport and export siderophores  <cit> , were up-regulated by more than two fold changes. concomitantly, the gene bfrb, which encodes the iron storage protein bacterioferritin  <cit> , was found to be down-regulated nearly  <dig> fold under nitrosative stress. these observations indicate that, especially under nitrosative stress, mtb strongly reacts by acquiring more iron from its environment.

the high number of de genes under nitrosative stress is probably linked to the up-regulation of several transcription factors from cog k category. several genes that are part of the t7ss were also up-regulated. a genome-wide binding approach of all predicted transcription factors showed that these genes could be regulated by the transcription factor encoded by rv3249c  <cit>  that was up-regulated by  <dig> fold under nitrosative stress. the t7ss, a mycobacterial specialised secretion machinery, translocates different effectors throughout the cell wall  <cit>  and plays a major role in the virulence of mtb  <cit> . of the five t7sss in mtb , esx- <dig>  <cit>  and esx- <dig>  <cit>  are known to be essential for virulence and growth of mtb. components of the t7ss might represent good targets for anti-tuberculosis drug discovery  <cit> . the newly discovered up-regulation of several esx- <dig> core channel genes and the genes encoding for esx- <dig> secreted substrates, pe <dig>  and ppe <dig> , might be a consequence of the iron depletion under nitrosative stress. to the best of our knowledge this is the first observation that nitrosative stress affects the expression of t7ss genes in mtb. interestingly, the secreted substrates pe <dig> and ppe <dig> are found to be critical for the siderophore- mediated iron-acquisition functions of esx- <dig> while esxg and esxh play an essential role in virulence  <cit> . eight pe/ppe genes were up-regulated with ppe <dig> being the most up-regulated one . this result corroborates previous studies reporting the over-expression of ppe <dig> under nitrosative and oxidative growth conditions  <cit> . in murine macrophages infected with m. smegmatis, ppe <dig> induced the low production of tumour necrosis factor alpha  and interleukin  <dig>   <cit> . some of the gene products of the up-regulated pe/ppe genes might therefore be involved in regulating cytokine production of the host cell. it is also important to highlight that under deta/no stress dosr and doss in cluster  <dig> were up-regulated  <dig> and  <dig> fold, respectively. the genes dosr and doss are conserved in many mycobacterial species and doss/dosr represents the two-component system that regulates the dormancy regulon in mtb  <cit> . the up-regulation of doss/dosr would lead to slower bacterial growth and lower metabolic activity. by reducing its metabolic activity, mtb could circumvent the genotoxic stress. while the doss/dosr two component system is extensively studied  its selective involvement in only some stress reactions needs further investigation.

notably, dsb damage inflicted by mmc treatment led especially to the up-regulation of 3r genes, predominantly dna repair genes . among the up-regulated 3r genes reca and lexa were the highest up-regulated genes which are in agreement with the fact that bacteria respond to dna damage by mounting a coordinated cellular sos response, governed by the reca and lexa. during normal bacterial growth, the lexa repressor down-regulates its own expression and regulates, in addition, the expression of more than  <dig> unlinked genes  <cit> . reca protein, upon dna damage, binds to single-stranded dna and induces the self-cleavage of lexa  <cit> . the dissociation of lexa from its dna targets causes the de-represseion of genes for dna damage repair and tolerance. among the up-regulated genes, we found nearly  <dig> genes  that harbour a putative sos box  <cit>  and thereby could be regulated by lexa. taken together, this shows that mmc induces a classic sos response in mtb.

several de genes that encode for hps were found in our analyses. the 3d structural modelling of these proteins showed that some of them may code for dna binding proteins, metal binding proteins, or endonucleases. they could play an important role in genome maintenance and stability during genotoxic stress as some of them were strongly induced  . these hps will be the subjects of future functional characterisation.

while the deta/no stress gave the highest number of de mrnas, the highest number of stress induced ncrnas was predicted for mmc stress when compared to the other treatments. collectively, these results show that mtb responds very differently to the various forms of stress  <cit> . among the cumulative  <dig> ncrnas,  <dig>  3′ utrs and  <dig>  5′ utrs were identified. the rest of the ncrnas  were located in coding sequences. this distribution could be explained by the fact that more than 90 % of the mtb genome is occupied by coding sequence. the ncrnas identified are distributed throughout the genome, while there seems to be some ncrna clustering . local genome content and architecture could be involved  <cit> . the classification of the predicted target genes  showed that six belong to the 3r category indicating an involvement in dna repair. among the genes targeted under oxidative stress by ncrnas are mutm , encoding a dna glycosylase  <cit> , and rv <dig>  encoding an exonuclease. another targeted gene, rv3202c , was found to be up-regulated under oxidative, nitrosative and mmc stress. this reflects the importance of adna, which was previously reported to be up-regulated together with rv3201c  under mmc treatment  <cit> . adnab is a helicase-nuclease which is involved in reca-dependent homologous recombination  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated the distinct transcriptomic responses mtb exerts when subjected to genotoxic stress. the data analyses revealed that in addition to the already reported de genes, genes involved in the t7ss and the pe/ppe gene families were found to be up-regulated under genotoxic stress. the structural analysis of the hypothetical proteins from de genes suggested that some of them are involved in genome maintenance. we also identified several ncrnas expressed under stress conditions and their potential gene targets thereby unravelling new regulatory networks of mtb. the insights into the networks that operate under genotoxic stress will enable deeper understanding of mtb survival strategies and in turn will help to gain better insight into the mycobacterial response to the host defense. our results furthermore provide a list of genome maintenance, survival and virulence factors that potentially could be considered as targets in drug discovery and vaccine development.
