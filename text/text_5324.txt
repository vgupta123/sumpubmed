BACKGROUND
association studies for the mapping of quantitative trait loci  and genetic evaluation in cattle is presently based on high-density snp marker sets. the dna variants that are causally involved in qtl variation are not necessarily among these markers. since linkage disequilibrium of markers and causal variants is not complete, marker-based qtl mapping and evaluation are consequently not maximally efficient  <cit> . maximal efficiency can only be achieved if all variable positions in the genome are assessed by whole-genome re-sequencing  <cit> .

although the advent of the next generation sequencing technology led to a dramatic reduction of sequencing costs, whole-genome sequencing of thousands of animals per population is still not affordable. scheet and stephens  <cit>  proposed to sequence a subset of individuals and to impute the missing genotypes in the general population via genotypes obtained by a snp chip. the sequenced animals are ideally key ancestors of the population, i.e. unrelated individuals with a maximal contribution to the genomic variation of the modern population  <cit> .

the feasibility and affordability of a whole-genome sequencing project also depends on the coverage required for efficient variant detection. a pilot of the human  <dig> genomes project, consisting of sequencing  <dig> individuals with a coverage of  <dig> x per individual only, allowed to catalogue the vast majority of variation in this sample  <cit> . the low coverage prevented immediate and reliable variant calling at many sites. however, multi-sample analysis and imputation provided a means of highly accurate and complete genotyping, compensating for the low coverage  <cit> .

the promising results of the first phase human  <dig> genomes project prompted us to apply low- to medium-coverage sequencing to key ancestors and some contemporary animals of a cattle population. imputation within the sample of  <dig> sequenced animals and subsequent genotype imputation allowed the identification of more than  <dig> million variable sites, most of them novel, with high confidence.

RESULTS
selection of key animals for re-sequencing
re-sequencing of a panel of optimally selected  <dig> key ancestors of the fleckvieh population would enable to capture ~ <dig> percent of the genetic diversity of the current population. however, obtaining dna samples of key ancestors is often difficult. the animals died decades ago and semen samples are not always available. thus, the actual  <dig> animals chosen for re-sequencing account for about  <dig> percent of the genetic diversity only. however, the twelve most influential animals account for ~ <dig> percent of the genetic diversity of the entire population . the set of selected animals comprises one sire-dam-offspring trio and totally eight parent-offspring duos .

re-sequencing data
close to ten billion paired-end reads of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases were obtained for the  <dig> animals on illumina ga iix and hiseq <dig> instruments. from  <dig>  percent to  <dig>  percent of the reads were mapped to the  <dig> chromosome scaffolds  of the bovine reference genome assembly umd <dig>   <cit>  encompassing  <dig>  billion bases. not considering pcr duplicates, that amounted from  <dig>  to  <dig>  percent  of the reads, the coverage ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads per position, with an average of  <dig>  reads for the  <dig> animals . the re-sequencing data have been contributed to the  <dig> bull genomes project  <cit> .

detection of single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions
multi-sample variant detection  <cit>  allowed the calling of genotypes at  <dig> , <dig> positions in each animal, meaning that at least one individual showed a deviation from the umd <dig>  reference sequence at each of these positions. in the case of missing or insufficient coverage, the most likely genotype was called based on the allele frequency at this site. beagle <cit>  haplotype phasing and imputation raised the percentage of genotypes with phred-scaled quality scores greater than  <dig> from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . most of the variants  were biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms  . insertion / deletion variants  amounted to  <dig>  percent of the variants . the remaining  <dig>  percent were triallelic variants. of the snps detected in this study,  <dig>  percent represent newly identified variants; the remaining  <dig>  percent are listed in build  <dig> of dbsnp. the rate of transitions to transversions  amounts to  <dig> , which is within the range observed in previous whole-genome sequence studies  <cit> . the number of biallelic snps per animal ranged from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> and did not depend on the coverage . the proportion of biallelic snp calls at sites without coverage ranged from  <dig>  percent to  <dig>  percent in the  <dig> animals .

multi-sample variant calling was performed as described in methods. the x chromosome was divided into a pseudoautosomal region  and a non-pseudoautsomal region  .

variants were submitted to dbsnp  under handle id tz_tum  and will be available from the ncbi snp database website upon the next build in march  <dig> 

evaluation of variant-calling
we compared array-called genotypes with sequence-derived genotypes at corresponding positions and calculated the non-reference sensitivity  and the non-reference discrepancy  rates  <cit>  to assess the sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the variant calling. both measures depend on the coverage, on whether or not beagle imputation is applied and on the minimal phred-scaled likelihood requirement . the effects of beagle imputation and minimal phred score requirement are most prominent if the coverage is below 7x. the nrd rate for the animal with the lowest coverage  was  <dig>  percent before and  <dig>  percent after beagle imputation. highest nrs values at comparably low nrd values are achieved after beagle imputation and after removal of genotypes with phred scores below  <dig> 

functional annotation of variants
the annotated sequence, including  <dig>  basepairs of putative promotor sequence, encompasses  <dig>  genes and  <dig> , <dig> basepairs of sequence and exhibits a total of  <dig>  variants . the coding sequence is affected by  <dig>  exchanges,  <dig>   of which are non-synonymous. kawahara-miki et al.  <cit>  reported a considerably higher rate  for a japanese animal. our result is more in line with the findings by stothard et al.  <cit>  and zhan et al.  <cit>  of  <dig> percent of non-synonymous exchanges in an angus and two holstein animals. fifty-eight percent of the non-synonymous substitutions are predicted to be “probably damaging” or “possibly damaging”  by polyphen- <dig> and  <dig>  are predicted to cause a premature stop codon, similar to reported findings  <cit> . each of the putative stop codon introducing variants needs to be scrutinized by manual examination of the reads, the re-annotation of the affected genes and sanger sequencing. bona fide stop codon causing variants need to be typed in a representative sample. absence of homozygosity may reveal undetected recessive disorders with nondescript or embryonically / fetally lethal phenotypes, with the latter manifesting themselves as reduced fertility  <cit> .

the catalogue of annotated variants allows to examine whether any of the causal variants for bovine mendelian traits / disorders listed in omia – online mendelian inheritance in animals  <cit>  is segregating in the re-sequenced sample of fleckvieh and therefore in the entire fleckvieh population. the umd <dig>  reference coordinates could be determined for  <dig> of the omia entries . the 2bp deletion in mocs <dig> responsible for arachnomelia  could be detected in a known heterozygous carrier of the defective variant. an amino acid exchange in rasgrp <dig> has been proposed to be the causal variant for a bleeding disorder in a simmental animal . eight of the re-sequenced animals carry the variant. it turns out that there are indeed animals in the fleckvieh population being affected with the bleeding disorder. a genome-wide association study with six thrombopathic animals as case group and  <dig> re-sequenced animals as controls yielded a strong association signal on chromosome  <dig> . subsequent autozygosity mapping in the affected animals revealed a common  <dig>  mb segment of extended homozygosity encompassing the location of rasgrp <dig> and corroborating recessive inheritance. sanger sequencing confirmed that all thrombopathic animals are homozygous for the pertinent amino acid exchange . among the affected animals are descendants of a re-sequenced bull. this bull did not appear to carry the variant. however, the relevant position is covered by two reads only, and after beagle imputation, we could indeed observe heterozygosity that was subsequently confirmed by sanger sequencing. this exemplifies both the power of re-sequencing key ancestors for the detection of genetic disorders and the importance of the imputing step at lowly covered sites. the fleckvieh breed exhibits a recessively inherited red and white coat  and is thus expected to be homozygous for the “red factor” causing deletion in the mc1r gene . all but one animal are homozygous. the only heterozygous animal, carrying both the deletion and the wild type allele is red and white. the reference sequence, derived from red and white hereford animals  <cit> , also contains the wild type allele of the mc1r gene. a deletion variant of pmel  causing coat color dilution segregates in the re-sequenced animals at a frequency of  <dig>  without apparent phenotypic effect. however, carriers of the variant allele are reported to produce progeny exhibiting a “diluted black” phenotype when crossed with black and white animals that carry the “dominant black” allele of mc1r. thus, our findings are in line with schmutz and dreger's  <cit>  discovery of interacting mc1r and pmel alleles.

there are only few reports on the detection of causal variants for quantitative traits in cattle, so called qtns  <cit> . a lysine-to-alanine substitution in acylcoa:diacyglycerol acyltransferase  has a major effect on the fat content of milk and milk yield  <cit> .the frequency of the milk-fat-enhancing and milk-yield-lowering lysine-allele is  <dig>  in the re-sequenced animals. a variant in the growth hormone receptor gene , causing a phenylalanine-to-tyrosine substitution  that affects milk yield and composition  <cit>  is segregating in the re-sequenced animals, with the milk-yield-enhancing and content-lowering tyrosine-allele amounting to a frequency of  <dig> . a missense mutation in the gene encoding atp-binding cassette, sub-family g , member  <dig>  affecting milk yield and composition  <cit>  is not segregating in the re-sequenced fleckvieh animals, i.e., they are fixed for the milk yield-enhancing allele. allelic variation of the prolactin receptor gene  affects protein and fat yield  <cit> . the asparagine-allele is yield-enhancing and has a frequency of  <dig>  in the re-sequenced animals. eberlein et al. <cit>  have shown association of a non-synonymous substitution in the g subunit of the non-smc condensin complex  with fetal growth. our re-sequencing reveals the allele leading to reduced fetal growth at a frequency of  <dig> . a recently postulated functional polymorphism close to the gene for pleiomorphic adenoma gene  <dig>  affecting stature  <cit>  could not be assessed since it is located in a not-sequenced gap of the umd <dig>  reference sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
next-generation sequencing of key ancestors of a cattle breed and multi-sample calling as recommended by nielsen  <cit>  allowed the reliable detection of more than  <dig> million variable positions in the bovine genome, more than eleven million of them novel. thus, this study significantly adds to the endeavour of sampling the genomic variation in bos taurus. we show that genotype imputation within the re-sequenced animals enhances genotype quality considerably, particularly in lowly covered samples.

the re-sequenced animals represent  <dig> percent of the genetic diversity of the fleckvieh population. we can expect the majority of causal variants, at least the not very rare ones, to be segregating among the sequenced animals. if a causal variant can be pinpointed to a specific haplotype as a result of genome-wide association studies, and if the haplotype is present in the sequenced ancestors, identification will often be straightforward. furthermore, inspecting already identified causal variants, such as listed in online mendelian inheritance of animals , allows to readily monitor the population for genetic disorders. since false positives are of no concern in this process, unfiltered variants should be considered and any match be confirmed by sanger sequencing. variant annotation led to the detection of  <dig> putative premature stop codons. each of the underlying variants needs to be scrutinized with regard to possible annotation errors and to be confirmed by sanger sequencing. premature stop codons often represent loss of function mutations with potentially severe consequences such as embryonic lethality in the homozygous state. thus, re-sequencing of key ancestors and functional annotation of variants should allow for a proactive management of genetic disorders.

the genotypes at more than  <dig> million positions can now be imputed in any animal of the fleckvieh breed with array-derived medium or high density genotypes. imputation accuracy should be high, at least for loci with minor allele frequencies >  <dig> , since the re-sequenced animals, as key ancestors, are highly representative for the population  <cit> . however, increasing the number of re-sequenced animals will be necessary for maximal imputation accuracy for loci with lower minor allele frequency. one can now envisage to perform genome-wide association studies based on re-sequencing derived and imputed genotypes to achieve maximal resolution of qtl mapping and the perspective of direct identification of causal variants. the imputed genotypes will also be the basis for more accurately predicting genomic values of selection candidates  <cit> .
