BACKGROUND
prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  are fatal and chronic neurodegenerative disorders that affect a variety of species. scrapie is the naturally occurring form that occurs in domestic sheep and goats. the infectious agent, a prion, consists primarily of an abnormal conformational isoform  of normal cellular prion protein   <cit> . classical scrapie is characterized by the accumulation of prpsc in the central nervous system and, in most cases, lymphoid tissues  <cit> . antemortem diagnosis of scrapie infections in sheep can be performed by immunohistochemical analysis of rectal tissues  <cit>  and nictitating membranes  <cit>  where infected animals show prpsc accumulation in the lymphoid follicles.

our previous bioassay studies in lambs and a transgenic mouse line  expressing the ovine vrq prnp allele revealed that scrapie prions were associated with different peripheral blood components such as buffy coat, peripheral blood mononuclear cells , b lymphocytes and platelet-rich plasma from preclinically and clinically affected sheep naturally infected with classical scrapie  <cit> . the association of prion infectivity with all the pbmc subsets and platelet-rich plasma from sheep experimentally inoculated with the pg <dig> classical scrapie isolate has also been shown using tg <dig> mice  <cit> . however, a tse- elisa based study concluded that prpsc in scrapie affected sheep blood  was principally associated with a subpopulation of b lymphocytes but not with monocytes or t lymphocytes  <cit> .

animal bioassay is one of the most sensitive systems for detection of prions as was evident from our previous work with the lamb bioassay model  <cit>  where classical scrapie prions were detected in blood from both preclinically and clinically affected sheep naturally infected with classical ovine scrapie isolates despite a lack of detection by the tse-elisa. therefore, to determine whether monocytes and t lymphocytes prepared from sheep naturally infected with classical ovine scrapie harbor scrapie prions, we again used this sensitive vrq/vrq lamb bioassay model.

RESULTS
lambs transfused with pbmc, monocytes or t lymphocytes developed scrapie
preclinical stages of scrapie infection in two vrq/vrq donor sheep naturally exposed to classical ovine scrapie were determined before blood sample collection. strong prpsc immunolabeling in the rectoanal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue  follicles from both donor sheep confirmed preclinical scrapie infection . as a positive control, vrq/vrq recipient lambs in treatment group  <dig> were transfused with pbmc prepared from the donor sheep. estimates of the total number of pbmc transfused into each recipient lamb are listed in table  <dig>  transmission of scrapie infection was evident as prpsc immunolabeling was detected in ramalt follicles from one of the four recipient lambs when biopsied at 6 months post inoculation  , thus confirming presence of scrapie prions in donor sheep blood at the time of blood collection for the inoculation. recipients and uninoculated control animals were humanely euthanized at  <dig> mpi and tissues were collected at necropsy for immunohistochemistry . prpsc immunolabeling was visible in ramalt follicles, alimentary tract-associated and peripheral lymphoid tissues of all four recipient sheep but prpsc immunolabeling was not detected in the brains of any recipients . prpsc immunolabeling was not detected in any of the tissues examined from two uninoculated control sheep co-housed with recipient sheep .fig.  <dig> detection of prpsc immunolabeling in the follicles of rectoanal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues of donor and recipient sheep. note the prpsc immunolabeling  was visible in the ramalt follicles of donor sheep  and recipient sheep transfused with pbmc , monocytes  or pan t lymphocytes . ihc was performed using a mixture of prion mabs f99/ <dig> . <dig> and f89/ <dig> . <dig>   and aec chromogen

discussion
using a lamb bioassay model, we have previously shown the transmission of scrapie following transfusion of pbmc, b lymphocytes and platelet-rich plasma prepared from sheep naturally infected with classical ovine scrapie  <cit> . in the present study, we have further identified monocytes and t lymphocytes as peripheral blood cell types that harbor scrapie prions, thus demonstrating all three subsets of pbmc can transmit scrapie. previous studies by us  <cit>  and others  <cit>  revealed that occasional prpsc granules positive b and t lymphocytes were present in the lymphoid tissues of scrapie-infected sheep. despite our best efforts, we could not detect prpsc granules labeling in the circulating monocytes, b or t lymphocytes. therefore, although our studies clearly confirmed that all three pbmc subsets harbor prion infectivity, we cannot conclude whether prpsc and scrapie infectivity of pbmc subsets were actively generated or acquired passively from other cells or tissues.

our previous transfusion studies in lambs revealed that pbmc or b lymphocytes isolated from 50 ml whole blood volumes from naturally infected sheep with scrapie was able to efficiently transmit the disease  <cit> . andreoletti et al.  has reported that as little as  <dig>  ml whole blood volume collected from scrapie pg <dig> isolate experimentally inoculated sheep was sufficient to transmit scrapie infection to recipient lambs  <cit> . although our most recent lamb bioassay study revealed that intravenous transfusion of b lymphocyte prepared from 5 ml blood sample volume was sufficient to transmit scrapie from clinically affected sheep naturally infected with classical scrapie, only two of the three recipient lambs developed preclinical scrapie infection  <cit> . since our donor sheep acquired scrapie by natural exposure routes as compared to experimental oral administration of scrapie brain homogenates in other studies, as a precautionary measure, we decided to isolate and then transfuse monocytes and t lymphocytes from 50 ml blood sample volume for the present study. for our previous transfusion studies in lambs, whole blood or several blood fractions from  <dig> different donor sheep preclinically or clinically infected with natural ovine scrapie were examined  <cit> . to further expand the number of donors used for blood transfusion studies in lambs, blood samples were collected from preclinically affected two additional donor sheep naturally infected with classical ovine scrapie.

we and others have also shown that vrq/vrq recipient lambs produced early preclinical scrapie infections following transfusion of blood fractions from vrq/vrq scrapie donor sheep  <cit> . therefore, the present study also took advantage of this short incubation period in the natural host as model biased for quick detection of scrapie prions in blood fractions having relatively high prion titers. as expected, early scrapie transmission in pbmc recipients was detected in all four recipients by  <dig> mpi, confirming the presence of scrapie prions in pbmc in both sheep when prepared from a 50 ml blood volume. in contrast, transfusion of the monocyte or t lymphocyte blood cell fractions, each also prepared from 50 ml blood volumes, resulted in respective transmission rates of only two of the five and one of four recipients. our previous blood transfusion study confirmed the efficient transmission of scrapie from vrq/vrq donors to arq/vrq recipient sheep such that prpsc accumulation can be detected in ramalt follicles within 6– <dig> mpi  <cit> . a recent study by gonzalez et al.,  revealed that although delayed scrapie progression was observed in arq/vrq sheep compered to vrq/vrq at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi, prpsc accumulation profiles were indistinguishable between two prnp genotypes at approximately  <dig> dpi  <cit> . since our recipient sheep were euthanized at  <dig> mpi, the lack of preclinical scrapie in arq/vrq recipient is very much unlikely due to the prnp polymorphism at  <dig> codon.

the longer times to first detection of scrapie transmission and apparently lower transmission rates are likely due to relatively lower infectious scrapie titers in monocyte and t lymphocyte inocula as compared to pbmc inocula. in particular, the lack of scrapie infectivity in both t lymphocyte inocula prepared from donor sheep  <dig> may have contained an insufficient dose of infectious prion since both monocyte and pbmc inocula prepared from the same donor was able to transmit scrapie infection to recipient lambs. it would have been informative to perform spmca on the donor cell fractions to determine the relative level of prpsc associated with each blood cell type, which may have provided an insight into why some donor fractions did not transmit disease. for example, duplicate monocyte or t cell preparations  did not induce pre-clinical scrapie disease in recipient sheep. however, since we did not collect additional blood samples from the donor sheep during the transfusion, or at necropsy, we were not able to perform spmca on the donor cell fractions. the total number of monocytes and t lymphocytes transfused into each lamb was in a range of  <dig> – <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig> – <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively. a previous study by edwards et al.,  reported that prpsc was not associated with cd14+ monocyte or cd2+ t lymphocyte but was associated with a subset of b lymphocytes  <cit> . the lack of prpsc signal detected in the monocytes of scrapie-infected sheep by elisa was attributed to the lack of scrapie prion or the suboptimal cell numbers used . however, positive prpsc signal was not reported even after using the optimal number of cd2+ t lymphocytes   <cit> . based on the findings of present bioassay study in lambs, we can suggest that although scrapie prion was clearly present in both cell types, scrapie titers in t lymphocytes may be lower as compared to pbmc. in our previous bioassay study in lambs, transmission of scrapie was confirmed in all three lambs receiving  <dig> ×  <dig> b lymphocytes and two of the three lambs receiving  <dig>  ×  <dig> b lymphocytes by  <dig> mpi  <cit> . although animal numbers used in this and previous studies  <cit>  are not sufficient for a powerful comparison, the findings in this study suggest that scrapie titers in similar numbers of monocytes and b lymphocytes may not be much different from each other.

although prpsc immunolabeling was detected in the brain tissues of monocytes and t lymphocytes recipients when necropsied at  <dig> mpi, such prpsc immunolabeling was not detected in the brain tissues of pbmc recipients when necropsied at  <dig> mpi. the lack of prpsc accumulation in brain tissues of pbmc recipient lambs is not surprising and most likely due to the early euthanasia at  <dig> mpi. such observations in lambs have been previously reported by us  <cit>  and others  <cit> . lateral transmission of scrapie has been previously reported amongst lambs fed milk derived from scrapie infected sheep  <cit> . in our study, lateral transmission was not detected in any of the uninoculated control lambs co-housed with transfusion recipients. these observations clearly indicate that the recipient sheep developed preclinical infections only from the transfused pbmc, monocytes or t lymphocytes.

several studies have suggested that peripheral blood leukocytes can be used as appropriate targets to detect preclinical vcjd infection in primates and bse infection in sheep when coupled with pmca  <cit> . serial pmca has also been successfully applied to detection of prion protein misfolding activity associated with peripheral blood buffy coat cells or pbmc from the scrapie-affected sheep  <cit> . although spmca was not performed at regular intervals similar to rectal biopsies, the results of spmca performed on pbmc isolated from monocyte and t lymphocyte recipient sheep were concordant with scrapie ihc results performed on antemortem and postmortem lymphoid tissue samples. although this study was not designed to determine the diagnostic accuracy  of spmca, these limited results support the use of pbmc as samples useful for the further development of highly sensitive antemortem diagnostic assay to determine scrapie infection in sheep.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that monocytes and t lymphocytes, in addition to b lymphocytes, harbor classical ovine scrapie prions in the blood of naturally scrapie-infected sheep. these findings also support the conclusion that pbmc might be a suitable blood fraction to target for the development of an in vitro blood-based diagnostic test to assess preclinical classical scrapie infection in sheep.
