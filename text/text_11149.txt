BACKGROUND
anabolic effects of β-adrenergic receptor agonists  have been widely studied for potential applications in the prevention of muscle atrophy  <cit>  and improvement of the efficiency of muscle growth in production livestock  <cit> . clenbuterol is a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist that has been shown to have a significant effect on muscle metabolism in a variety of muscle atrophy models, including hind-limb suspension atrophy  <cit> , starvation induced atrophy  <cit> , and denervation induced atrophy  <cit> . additionally, clenbuterol is known to induce a significant repartitioning effect by increasing the growth of skeletal muscle at the expense of fat tissues in most livestock species  <cit> . although it is known that clenbuterol initiates these effects via activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor  <cit> , the downstream mechanisms by which activation of these receptors results in increased muscle growth or decreased muscle atrophy are not clear. to date, the expression and activity of specific genes have been investigated in a variety of models in order to implicate specific pathways with the skeletal muscle response to ba. for example, increased abundance of myofibrillar and structural proteins has been demonstrated and appears to result from increases in both transcription and translation of these genes  <cit> . additionally, endogenous proteinases including genes of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and calcium-dependent proteolytic enzymes have been reported to mediate protein turnover in skeletal muscle after administration of ba  <cit> . finally, changes in skeletal muscle expression of igf <dig> and igf <dig> mrna have been observed shortly after the administration of clenbuterol to rodents  <cit> , suggesting the regulation of these growth factors may be important in the initial response of skeletal muscle to ba.

although investigations of candidate genes have been informative in terms of implicating individual pathways in the skeletal muscle response to ba, they have not provided a global view of changes occurring in the tissue, and have been limited to the investigation of genes with known functions. thus, the objective of the current research was to define changes in the global gene expression profile of skeletal muscle in response to administration of the ba clenbuterol. two time points relative to clenbuterol administration were investigated in order to compare gene expression profiles following short-  and long-  term clenbuterol administration in mice. the affymetrix platform was chosen for the analysis of gene expression in order to investigate the most comprehensive collection of genes available.

RESULTS
clenbuterol stimulated an anabolic response
a significant effect of clenbuterol on blood urea nitrogen  was observed due to decreased bun in  <dig> h compared to control  treatment groups . although average bun of  <dig> d treated mice was less than that of c mice, this difference was not statistically significant . body weight gain tended to differ among the three groups of mice , with a significant increase in body weight gain observed following  <dig> d clenbuterol administration compared to the c group .

clenbuterol stimulated changes in mrna abundance
a total of  <dig>  probesets were deemed detected across the moe430a and moe430b chips and were included in all subsequent analyses. all data were deposited in the geo data base . a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> probesets were differentially expressed based on false discovery rates  of  <dig>   <dig>  and 5%, respectively, which correspond to p-values less than  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. we considered genes that were significant at the 10% fdr threshold significantly differentially expressed. while individual nominal significance levels are often set at 5%, when multiple tests are performed the impact of both the type i  and type ii  error rate should be carefully considered. the fdr provides a way of controlling the expected number of false positives in the list of tests rejected  <cit> . with  <dig> rejections a 10% fdr says that the expectation is less than six false positives. in this case, the substantial increase in the number of genes identified is much larger than the anticipated increase in type i error and so we opted to place more weight on reducing the type ii error and increasing power. among these  <dig> probesets, four displayed evidence for non-normal distributions of residuals. in order to be conservative we do not consider these further, leaving  <dig> probesets deemed differentially expressed . the mrna abundance of 63% of these probesets differed at both  <dig> h and  <dig> d, with  <dig> transcripts having consistently more and  <dig> consistently less mrna relative to c at both time points. one gene, a530047j11rik, changed in opposite directions relative to c in the  <dig> h and  <dig> d treatment groups. a total of  <dig> probesets showed altered mrna abundance in the  <dig> h but not  <dig> d treatment, with approximately equal numbers increasing  and decreasing  relative to the c group.

a recent paper from yi and xu  <dig>  <cit>  describes a method for grouping or clustering genes based upon a time series that places genes with similar expression patterns, regardless of statistical significance, into clusters. we applied this technique to our data and found that the  <dig>  detected genes were grouped into a total of  <dig> clusters describing gene expression profiles over time . the number of probesets included in each cluster ranged from eight to  <dig>  , with the largest group representing genes with a 'flat' profile, or no evidence of changes in gene expression. however, this method identified  <dig> genes whose mean gene expression changed over time. expression changes represented by each cluster are shown in figure  <dig>  and the cluster to which each probeset belongs is given in supplementary table  <dig> 

the discrepancy between the number of genes whose mean behaviour appears different, and the number which are statistically significant after correction for multiple tests, may be indicative of weaker signals in these data than in many array experiments where the treatment conditions produce a dramatic direct response. if clenbuterol indirectly affects a gene, by perhaps targeting an upstream regulator, the magnitude of the effect seen in the downstream targets would be lower. in order to include genes potentially indirectly regulated by clenbuterol administration in our exploratory analysis of the functional groups underlying response to clenbuterol, a nominal threshold of p <  <dig>  was used. this group of  <dig> genes was examined further to help identify biological processes potentially influenced by clenbuterol treatment. a total of  <dig> of these genes were categorized into  <dig> gene ontology biological process categories  with two or more members, while  <dig> genes remained unclassified . categories with the greatest number of genes are consistent with the model of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. analysis results for all genes, including the overall and contrast p-values, cluster, and mean expression for each treatment  are provided in supplementary table  <dig> 

clenbuterol stimulated changes in families and categories of genes
five hundred and seventy five genes  were further evaluated using ease score  <cit>  to identify categories of over-represented genes, based on the gene ontology biological process annotation. briefly, the ease score compares the proportion of differentially expressed genes found within a category to the proportion of genes in that category detected from the genechip. the ease score test statistic accounts for issues related to multiple testing across many biological process categories in a semi-conservative manner  <cit> . a total of  <dig> biological process categories were over-represented in our set of genes of interest, based on an ease score <  <dig> . after accounting for redundant categories, the differentially expressed genes were classified into  <dig> over-represented groups . categories of particular interest to the model of clenbuterol stimulated muscle hypertrophy include: intracellular signaling cascade, amino acid and derivative metabolism, translation, and transcription from the pol ii promoter. specific genes from these categories are described in detail in the discussion and highlighted in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the list of genes of interest was also searched for members that had previously been associated with ba induced muscle hypertrophy, including structural genes, igf <dig> and its receptors and binding proteins, and genes involved in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .

validation of differential gene expression
differential expression of four genes was validated in an independent experiment using a different set of mice from the microarray experiment. genes were selected from the list of statistically significantly differentially expressed genes to represent different biological processes important to muscle physiology, including genes that interact with structural proteins , a regulator of transcription , and a growth factor implicated in multiple facets of muscle growth and differentiation . in concordance with the microarray data, mrna abundance of each of these genes increased  <dig> h after administration of clenbuterol treatment relative to c animals , while gapdh represented a housekeeping gene whose mrna abundance did not differ between treatments . thus, these data provide strong biological validation of results from the genechip experiment.

discussion
although it has been known for decades that ba stimulate muscle hypertrophy  <cit> , the data described herein are the first to provide an overview of global changes in gene expression associated with this biological model. these results also contribute to a growing body of literature describing gene expression changes associated with various models of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy  <cit> . together, these data facilitate the opportunity to define genes across multiple models of muscle physiology, as well as to identify genes specific to the effects of ba. one unique aspect of our experiment is the investigation of gene expression at two time points relative to the administration of clenbuterol. previous studies have focused on altered gene and/or protein expression after significant changes in muscle mass have occurred  <cit> . however, results of our study indicate that changes in gene expression are equally abundant at an early time point relative to the initiation of clenbuterol administration. these initial changes may represent important alterations of physiological pathways that culminate in altered protein turnover and/or recruitment of satellite cells to support muscle growth.

our analysis showed that four of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes  met an even more stringent 5% fdr threshold: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1a  , tsc <dig> domain family, member  <dig> , growth hormone receptor , and tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like . two of these genes, cdkn1a and ghr, are of particular interest to this experimental model because of their well-established roles in muscle growth and development  <cit> . cdkn1a inhibits cyclin dependent kinase  <dig> activity, contributing to the irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle and terminal differentiation of myocytes  <cit> . although the presence of cdkn1a is not required for normal development of mice  <cit> , the absence of this gene product prevents normal regeneration of muscle through satellite cells  <cit> . therefore, the significant upregulation of cdkn1a mrna abundance following both short and long-term clenbuterol administration in our experiment may suggest an increased potential for terminal differentiation and recruitment of myogenic precursor cells in support of muscle hypertrophy. ghr is the transmembrane receptor for growth hormone , a hormone essential for normal growth  <cit> . although gh effects are largely mediated through the stimulation of synthesis and secretion of insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , it has been demonstrated that gh has important roles in the postnatal regulation of skeletal muscle growth that are independent of igf <dig>  <cit> . this work demonstrates gh signalling from ghr influences muscle hypertrophy by facilitating the fusion of myoblasts with myotubes  <cit> . our data reveal a significant down-regulation of ghr in skeletal muscle following one and ten days of clenbuterol administration. this change in ghr expression is consistent with previous reports of decreased ghr mrna in a compensatory overload model  <cit> , and fiber-type specific increased ghr mrna in a hindlimb suspension model of muscle atrophy  <cit> . together, these reports clearly implicate ghr as a potential regulator of skeletal muscle growth and atrophy across multiple experimental models.

the ease classification of potential genes of interest also identified overrepresented functional categories known to be important in muscle physiology and growth. closer evaluation of genes within these categories reveals multiple pathways that potentially contribute to ba induced muscle hypertrophy. each of the genes discussed below is included in table  <dig> or  <dig>  which include the level of significance, fold and direction of change for each gene. additionally, all genes grouped in the categories of interest described below are identified in supplementary table  <dig> 

amino acid and derivative metabolism
the group of  <dig> genes categorized as being involved in 'amino acid and derivative metabolism' includes three genes critical to polyamine metabolism . polyamines, including spermine, spermidine, and putrescine, are polycationic compounds found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that are known to be crucial to growth and proliferation of mammalian cells  <cit> . the three genes differentially expressed in our experiment represent critical steps in the biosynthesis of polyamines. polyamines have previously been associated with cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by ba  <cit> . for example, the odc <dig> inhibitor dfmo successfully blocked cardiac hypertrophy normally associated with clenbuterol  <cit> , and overexpression of odc <dig> in a transgenic model resulted in a significant increase in ba stimulated cardiac hypertrophy relative to non-transgenic mice  <cit> . these experiments demonstrate a clear interaction between polyamines and beta adrenergic receptor stimulated cardiac hypertrophy. however, the relationship between polyamine metabolism and beta adrenergic receptors remains to be defined for skeletal muscle. our data suggest that clenbuterol administration increases mrna abundance of odc <dig> while decreasing the abundance of amd <dig> and smox. this differential regulation is difficult to interpret since each of these genes participate in the synthesis of polyamines. however, increased odc <dig> expression is consistent with cardiac models that demonstrate an interaction between odc <dig> activity and ba. it is also of interest to note that mrna abundance was altered for two genes that function in the transport of arginine , the precursor of ornithine. however, mrna abundance for these transporters changed in opposite directions following clenbuterol administration. the identification of differential expression of multiple genes involved in polyamine metabolism, combined with previous data linking polyamines to ba induced cardiac hypertrophy define polyamine metabolism as a critical target for further investigation of ba induced skeletal muscle growth.

translation
this gene ontology category was represented by  <dig> genes, including four eukaryotic translation initiation factors. eukaryotic initiation factor  <dig>  is involved in the first step of translation through the formation of a ternary complex between the initiator trna and gtp  <cit> . this complex then binds to the 40s ribosomal subunit to initiate translation. following start codon recognition, gtp is hydrolyzed and the resulting gdp-eif <dig> complex is released. a new cycle of initiation of translation requires eif2b to catalyze the exchange of eif2-bound gdp for gtp, which is an important step in the regulation of translation initiation. because eif2b is present in low amounts, it is an important factor controlling the global rate of protein synthesis  <cit> . our data show that mrna abundance of two subunits of eif2b, eif2b <dig>  and eif2b <dig> , are upregulated in response to clenbuterol administration. increased abundance of these subunits may contribute to increased activity of eif2b and the global upregulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle previously associated with clenbuterol administration  <cit> . an association between eif2b and adrenergic receptors has also been described as eif2b <dig> directly interacts with the beta- <dig> adrenergic receptor  <cit> . overexpression of eif2b <dig> in  <dig> cells caused a small but significant increase in beta adrenergic receptor signalling activity. although expression of eif2b <dig> was not altered in our experiment, it is not known if the effect of eif2b <dig> on beta receptor activity depends on association with other proteins, such as eif2b <dig> and eif2b <dig> that may be present in limiting quantities. therefore, the observed upregulation of eif2b <dig> and eif2b <dig> in our study may represent a mechanism by which clenbuterol administration enhances signalling activity from beta adrenergic receptors. in addition to these eif2b subunits, elongation initiation factor  <dig>  and elongation initiation factor 4g <dig>  also had increased mrna abundance  <dig> hours after clenbuterol administration. together, these results are consistent with a general upregulation of translational machinery occurring shortly after the administration of clenbuterol.

transcription from pol ii promoter
a total of  <dig> genes were found in this category, including four genes with known functions in muscle growth and development: homeobox only domain , yy <dig> transcription factor , myocyte enhancer factor 2c , and myogenin . the yy <dig> transcription factor has been associated with myogenic differentiation  <cit> . in skeletal muscle, yy <dig> inhibits transcription of the alpha actin gene, and down-regulation of yy <dig> is necessary for alpha actin expression and myogenic differentiation to proceed  <cit> . our data show a significant increase in yy <dig> mrna abundance following  <dig> hours and  <dig> days of clenbuterol administration, potentially contributing to decreased differentiation of myogenic cells. however, alterations in yy <dig> protein abundance have been shown to occur through proteolytic regulation, independent of changes in mrna  <cit> . thus, future investigation of the regulation of yy <dig> in response to ba stimulation will require careful consideration of changes at both the mrna and protein level. another transcription factor that was differentially expressed in our experiment was hod, an unusual homeodomain protein that modulates cardiac growth and development  <cit> . hod functions by interacting with serum response factor  to inhibit activation of srf-dependent transcription  <cit> . inactivation of hod in transgenic mouse models confirm that an absence of hod results in an imbalance between proliferation and differentiation of cardiomyocytes, culminating in impaired cardiac development  <cit> . in contrast, transgenic mice that overexpress hod develop severe cardiac hypertrophy that is mediated by inhibition of srf-dependent transcriptional activity. our data show a significant increase in hod mrna  <dig> hours after clenbuterol administration. although the effect of hod on skeletal muscle growth and differentiation has not been described, its effect on cardiac hypertrophy makes it an intriguing candidate as a potential mediator of the growth promoting effects of clenbuterol. additionally, the regulation of hod by ba may have important implications regarding cardiac hypertrophy commonly observed in response to these compounds  <cit> . myogenin and mef2c are well characterized transcription factors known to be essential for myoblast differentiation  <cit> . although significant alteration of satellite cell differentiation and recruitment into muscle fibers in response to ba has not been described, the observed increase in mrna of transcription factors that contribute to muscle cell differentiation suggest the recruitment and differentiation of pre-myogenic cells may be involved in the physiological response of skeletal muscle to clenbuterol administration.

intracellular signalling cascade
of the  <dig> genes of interest categorized as intracellular signalling molecules, four belong to the mitogen activated protein  kinase signalling pathway -like ). the map kinase signal transduction pathway is of particular interest to this skeletal muscle model because it is a key mediator of the cellular response to insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , a known regulator of myogenic cell proliferation, differentiation, and protein turnover  <cit> . in our experiment, mrna abundance of igf <dig> increased  <dig> hours after clenbuterol administration , but was not different from c after  <dig> days. inconsistent results describing the effect of ba on igf <dig> have been reported, but these likely reflect differences in the timing and sampling  across experiments. additionally, igf <dig> receptor  and igf binding protein  <dig>  had decreased mrna abundance at both  <dig> h and  <dig> d time points. although our experiment was not designed to clarify the relationship between igf <dig> and ba stimulated muscle growth, it does provide data suggesting an interaction between these pathways. one potential explanation is that cross-talk between these pathways facilitates complex regulation of the recruitment of myogenic precursor cells or protein turnover within muscle fibers.

the intracellular signalling cascade category also includes three members of the ankyrin repeat and socs-box  containing gene family: asb <dig> , asb <dig>  and asb <dig> . members of this gene family have been shown to act as an e <dig> ligase to target specific proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway  <cit> . although specific proteins targeted for degradation through interactions with asb <dig>  asb <dig> and asb <dig> have not been identified, we have previously reported that asb <dig> mrna is down-regulated in response to ba in other animal models  <cit> . additionally, we have demonstrated that localized over-expression of asb <dig> stimulates muscle hypertrophy in vivo, and that its over-expression causes a delay in differentiation and increase in protein synthesis in c2c <dig> cells  <cit> . the current experiment provides additional support for the hypothesis that asb family members participate in the regulation of intracellular signalling via beta adrenergic receptors by showing that multiple members of the asb family are coordinately regulated at the mrna level. although much remains to be learned about the asb gene family and its role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination, the down-regulation of three members of the asb family supports the idea of changes in the turnover of specific, targeted proteins in response to ba.

the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway is known to be a major contributor to protein degradation in skeletal muscle, and decreases in components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway have been associated with decreased protein degradation leading to muscle hypertrophy  <cit> . additionally, administration of clenbuterol has been reported to alter expression of ubiquitin-proteasome conjugates in mice following hindlimb suspension  <cit> . although the ease analysis of our data did not identify ubiquitin related genes to be significantly over-represented, three genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, including ubiquitin protein ligase e <dig> component n-recognin  <dig> , seven in abstentia  <dig> , and proteasome subunit, beta type  <dig> , were differentially expressed. it should also be noted that the asb gene family members previously discussed were not associated with gene ontology terms related to the ubiquitin pathway at the time of analysis. the mrna abundance of the three ubiquitin related genes was upregulated following clenbuterol administration in our experiment. this result was unexpected because an increase in components of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway is associated with increased protein degradation  <cit> , while clenbuterol is known to decrease protein degradation  <cit> . one potential explanation for this finding is that skeletal muscle undergoes significant fiber-type transition in response to clenbuterol administration, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been implicated in this process  <cit> . therefore, our results may reflect changes in skeletal muscle specifically associated with fiber-type transition, rather than a general increase in protein degradation.

structural proteins
few examples of structural proteins typically associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy were found in the list of differentially expressed genes, although myosin ib , actinin alpha  <dig> , and myosin xviiia  had altered mrna abundance associated with clenbuterol administration. additionally, genes encoding proteins that interact with structural proteins were regulated. for example, actin related protein 2/ <dig> complex subunit , and vinculin  increased in mrna abundance after administration of clenbuterol. vinculin is an integrin-associated protein located at junctions between actin and the plasma membrane, while arpc <dig> is a subunit of the arp2/ <dig> complex which functions in actin remodeling  <cit> . vinculin is thought to facilitate actin organization by recruiting the arp2/ <dig> complex which binds to actin  <cit> . both arpc <dig> and vcl had increased mrna abundance following clenbuterol administration. thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that arpc <dig> and vcl are upregulated in the present study in order to support an increase in structural proteins associated with muscle hypertrophy.

CONCLUSIONS
global evaluation of gene expression after administration of clenbuterol identified changes in gene expression and overrepresented functional categories that may regulate ba-induced muscle hypertrophy. changes in the mrna abundance of multiple genes associated with myogenic differentiation may indicate an important effect of ba on the proliferation, differentiation, and/or recruitment of satellite cells into muscle fibers to promote muscle hypertrophy. additionally, increased mrna abundance of genes involved in the initiation of translation suggests that increased levels of protein synthesis often associated with ba administration may result from a general up-regulation of translational initiators, rather than a sustained up-regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level. finally, numerous other genes and physiological pathways were identified that will be important targets for further investigations of the hypertrophic effect of ba on skeletal muscle.
