BACKGROUND
in comparison to invertebrate chordates, vertebrates are characterized by an elaborate head with an expanded brain, elaborate sensory organs, and a craniofacial skeleton. these modifications from the ancestral chordate where enabled in part by the appearance of neural crest cells, neurogenic placodes, and muscularized hypomeres, which are derived from definitive mesoderm, in the ancestral vertebrate  <cit> . these three tissues, along with the neural ectoderm, interact in diverse ways to form the elaborate head structures of vertebrates, including sensory organs and craniofacial skeletal components  <cit> . the pituitary gland also appears with the formation of vertebrates and is partially derived from the adenohypophyseal placode  <cit> . the contributions of the adenohypophyseal placode to pituitary development are well described  <cit> ; however, much less is known about neural crest and definitive mesoderm contributions to pituitary organogenesis.

rathke’s pouch, the precursor to the pituitary anterior and intermediate lobes, is surrounded by cranial head mesenchyme and is in close proximity to the rostral end of the notochord and pre-chordal plate, which have important signaling functions in early head development  <cit> . chick explant studies demonstrated that co-cultures of the ventral diencephalon and rathke’s pouch could only induce differentiation of corticotropes when mesenchyme was included in the culture  <cit> . additionally, explants of chick notochord can cause surface ectoderm to invaginate, forming a structure similar to rathke’s pouch  <cit> . these experiments suggest that chick head mesenchyme plays a role in supporting cell differentiation in the anterior lobe. the permissive mesenchymal signal for anterior lobe cell specification has not been identified. several secreted factors expressed in mouse pituitary adjacent mesenchyme, including chordin, noggin, nbl <dig>  and fstl <dig>  are candidates for a mesenchymal signal in pituitary organogenesis . foxd <dig> is a forkhead domain transcription factor expressed in the pituitary adjacent mesenchyme, and foxd1−/− mice have increased proliferation of anterior lobe cells and decreased lhβ expression. these results suggest that foxd <dig> may regulate the expression of a mesenchymal signal necessary for pituitary development  <cit> .

the cranial mesenchyme contributes to the hypophyseal portal system, which is a network of blood vessels that surrounds and invades the pituitary gland, enabling delivery of releasing hormones from the hypothalamus to the pituitary anterior lobe and from the pituitary gland to target organs in the body. the head mesenchyme is comprised of both definitive mesoderm, migrating through the primitive streak, and neural crest, which migrates away from the dorsal side of the neural tube and throughout the body  <cit> . the neural crest forms much of the peripheral nervous system, which is consistent with its ectodermal origin, but within the head it contributes to tissues, such as bones, muscles, and dermis of the skin, which are usually derived from definitive mesoderm  <cit> . in recognition of the diversity of tissues generated by the neural crest, it is frequently described as a fourth germ layer  <cit> . the developmental plasticity of the neural crest results from the maintenance of a gene regulatory network, characteristic of pluripotent blastula cells, in the neural crest lineage  <cit> . the cranial vasculature reflects the dual contributions of definitive mesoderm and neural crest; endothelial cells are derived from definitive mesoderm and the neural crest forms the pericytes and smooth muscle that wrap around and regulate the endothelial cells . to define the contributions of head mesenchyme to pituitary organogenesis, we utilized a genetic model to examine neural crest contributions to pituitary gland organogenesis. β-catenin is a key component of canonical wnt signaling, and loss of β-catenin in the neural crest lineage is known to cause apoptosis of migrating neural crest cells, leading to severe head malformations  <cit> . we present here an analysis of pituitary gland organogenesis in the absence of neural crest, and uncovered a critical role for neural crest contributions to the pituitary vasculature.

RESULTS
tg11rth  and c57bl/6 j-tg94imeg  are frequently used to fate map and generate tissue specific loss-of-function alleles in the neural crest  <cit> . to determine the contributions of the neural crest to head mesenchyme near the developing pituitary gland we crossed both the wnt1-cre and p0-cre lines with the reporter lines b <dig> gt26sortm4luo  and gt26sortm1sho  to determine neural crest contributions to the pituitary adjacent head mesenchyme  <cit> . at embryonic day of development  <dig>   both wnt1-cre and p0-cre mediate recombination in the migrating neural crest cells . the wnt1-cre also mediates recombination in the midbrain, a domain of cre activity that is not observed in the p0-cre. the midbrain activity of wnt1-cre is also observed at e <dig> , but it is not confined to the midbrain, as lacz is expressed in the posterior diencephalon and in the anterior hindbrain . at e <dig>  the head mesenchyme rostral to rathke’s pouch expresses lacz, indicating that it is derived from the neural crest . the head mesenchyme caudal to rathke’s pouch is devoid of x-gal staining, suggesting that this tissue is derived from definitive mesoderm  <cit> . a sharp boundary between the neural crest derived head mesenchyme and the definitive mesenchyme is observed ventral to rathke’s pouch in midsagittal sections . rathke’s pouch is located at the rostral end of the notochord, and chick explants studies demonstrate that the notochord may be involved in rathke’s pouch formation  <cit> . at more lateral sections the boundary between neural crest and definitive mesoderm is not as sharp, as the definitive mesoderm extends past the lateral edge of rathke’s pouch . at e <dig>  x-gal stained cells are detected in the forming pituitary anterior lobe of wnt1-cre; rosastoplacz embryos, suggesting that the neural crest derived mesenchyme is invading the oral ectoderm-derived rathke’s pouch tissue . by e <dig>  wnt1-cre expressing cells have made a significant contribution to the pituitary gland . lineage tracing in p0-cre; rosastoplacz embryos at e <dig>  also demonstrates a sharp boundary between neural crest and definitive mesoderm at mid-sagittal locations . although wnt1-cre activity in the midbrain and neural crest and p0-cre activity in the neural crest mimic endogenous wnt <dig> and p <dig> expression, we also observed ectopic activity in the ventral diencephalon for both cre lines , and cre activity in rathke’s pouch for the p0-cre .fig.  <dig>

previous work established that wnt1-cre mediated deletion of β-catenin causes neural crest cells to undergo apoptosis during migration, which provides a method to generate neural crest deficient embryos  <cit> . because pituitary development was not analyzed in these embryos, we crossed wnt1-cre with b <dig> -ctnnb1tm2kem/knwj  and then generated wnt1-cre;β-catfx/fx embryos to determine if the neural crest derived head mesenchyme is important for pituitary organogenesis. indeed, wnt1-cre;β-catfx/fx embryos do have abnormalities in pituitary development . at early stages of rathke’s pouch formation  a larger domain of oral ectoderm is recruited into rathke’s pouch, as marked by immunostaining for the critical lim homeodomain transcription factor, lhx <dig> . at e <dig>  the enlarged, mutant rathke’s pouch includes more oral ectoderm tissue than typical, extending more rostrally than normal . the enlarged domain of presumptive pituitary tissue becomes highly dysmorphic . the abnormal pituitary extends through the cartilage plate that underlies the pituitary gland at e <dig>  and can form an anterior lobe like structure that projects into the oral cavity at more rostral locations .fig.  <dig>

the dysmorphic pituitary of wnt1cre; β-catfx/fx embryos resembles those of other genetically modified mouse embryos that have an expansion of the pituitary organizer in the ventral diencephalon  <cit> . the pituitary organizer is characterized in part by the expression of fgf <dig> and bmp <dig>  which are necessary for the induction and proliferation of rathke’s pouch  <cit> . we examined bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> expression in wild type and wnt1cre; β-catfx/fx embryos by in situ hybridization and found that the mutant embryos have expanded expression domains of both morphogenetic proteins . the expression domain of the transcription factor six <dig> typically exists in the ventral diencephalon rostral to the pituitary organizer. six <dig> expression is shifted rostrally from rathke’s pouch in the mutant embryos . these results demonstrate that the patterning within the ventral diencephalon is disrupted in wnt1cre; β-catfx/fx embryos. excess bmp and fgf signaling from the pituitary organizer likely contributes to the recruitment of additional oral ectoderm into rathke’s pouch .fig.  <dig> rna in situ hybridization on e <dig>  sagittal sections . arrows represent the boundary of expression between the domain of bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> expression and adjacent six <dig> expressing domain in the ventral diencephalon. a & b

wnt1-cre is expected to drive recombination in multiple tissues where loss of β-catenin could affect pituitary organogenesis, including the neural crest and ventral diencephalon. we examined β-catenin expression by immunohistochemistry to determine the efficiency of cre recombination in these tissues . at e <dig>  the wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos do not express β-catenin in the residual neural crest derived mesenchyme rostral to rathke’s pouch, indicating that wnt1-cre efficiently recombines the conditional β-catenin allele in this tissue . wnt1-cre is not uniformly active within the ventral diencephalon, and only small clumps of cells exhibit loss of β-catenin . this level of β-catenin ablation is unlikely to alter ventral diencephalon patterning. however, we may be underestimating the degree of β-catenin ablation as the protein persists in the adherens junctions for many hours following recombination at the β-catenin locus  <cit> . in addition, the presence of β-catenin protein in the adherens junctions does not maintain canonical wnt signaling after cre mediated recombination  <cit> . therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that β-catenin ablation in the infundibular domain may result in an expansion of the pituitary organizer.fig.  <dig> immunostaining for β-catenin  on e <dig>  sagittal sections, counterstained with dapi  a–c wild type, boxed regions in a are magnified in b and c. b region highlighting neural crest derived mesenchyme c region highlighting ventral diencephalon d–f

we sought to recapitulate the wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx phenotype using the p0-cre, which is also active in the neural crest and has some ectopic activity in the ventral diencephalon, to confirm that loss of β-catenin in these domains causes the pituitary phenotype. p0-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos have severe craniofacial malformations compared to wild type littermates consistent with a neural crest deficiency , and similar in phenotype to wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos  <cit> . however, unlike wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos, the pituitary morphology of p0-cre; β-catfx/fx mutant embryos is very similar to wild type despite the absence of neural crest derived cranial mesenchyme rostral to rathke’s pouch, as evidenced by the absence of the cartilage plate rostral to the pituitary gland . using immunostaining we determined that the p0-cre efficiently recombines the conditional β-catenin allele in the neural crest, but not in the ventral diencephalon at e <dig>  . within rathke’s pouch, variable, small patches of β-catenin deficient cells are observed, but β-catenin is not completely eliminated . thus, both wnt1-cre and p0-cre are similarly effective in deleting β-catenin in the neural crest, but the p0-cre does not delete β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon. therefore, the wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx dysmorphic pituitary is not caused by the loss of neural crest cells.fig.  <dig>

the p0-cre can drive recombination in rathke’s pouch, and β-catenin can influence the activity of the transcription factors prop <dig>  pit <dig> , pitx <dig>  and sf <dig>  in the pouch and its derivatives . therefore, we sought to determine if the ectopic, mosaic loss of β-catenin in the p0-cre; β-catfx/fx pouch could alter anterior lobe cell specification. no significant changes in hormone expressing cell types were observed in the mutant embryos , indicating that the mosaic loss of β-catenin in rathke’s pouch does not disrupt pituitary cell specification.fig.  <dig>

wnt signaling in the ventral diencephalon is known to regulate the expression domain of the pituitary organizer  <cit> . while the mosaic loss of β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon observed with wnt1-cre is unlikely to alter pituitary organizer activity, we sought to inactivate β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon to determine if canonical wnt signaling mediates pituitary organizer expression. we crossed shhtm1cjt  with rosastoplacz and stained embryo sections with x-gal. we detected staining in the ventral diencephalon and the oral ectoderm at e <dig>  in a pattern that recapitulates the endogenous expression of shh   <cit> . we next crossed the shh-cre with β-catfx/fx to determine if the loss of β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon would lead to an expanded pituitary organizer and an expansion of rathke’s pouch. at e <dig>  the pituitaries of shh-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos were indistinguishable from wild type littermates . the lack of β-catenin in the shh expressing domain of the fore and hind limbs leads to disruptions in digit formation, as expected . previous studies have demonstrated that β-catenin is necessary for maintaining limb mesenchyme and fgf <dig> expression in the apical ectodermal ridge  <cit> . we used immunostaining to determine whether the shh-cre effectively deleted β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon. although there were patches of cells that were negative for β-catenin immunostaining, the majority of cells in the ventral diencephalon retained β-catenin expression . we concluded that unlike in the limb bud, the shh-cre is unable to efficiently recombine the β-catfx/fx allele in the ventral diencephalon, leaving canonical wnt signaling largely intact. this result also confirms that the mosaic loss of β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon is insufficient for producing the dysmorphic pituitaries of wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos.

there are many precedents for variability in cre-mediated deletion, including parent-of-origin effects, episome formation, number of conditional alleles, and genetic background differences, any of which could affect the activity of the transgenic cre lines used in this study . however, the three cre lines used here demonstrate that β-catenin deletion in the neural crest and mosaic β-catenin deletion in the ventral diencephalon do not generate a dysmorphic pituitary gland. the major difference in activity between the cre lines is the expression of wnt1-cre in the midbrain.

we tested the possibility that loss of β-catenin in the midbrain results in patterning disruptions of the ventral diencephalon by examining additional markers of the posterior ventral diencephalon. our fate mapping studies suggest that the wnt1-cre is also active in the posterior diencephalon . immunoflourescence for β-catenin on e <dig>  wild type and wnt1-cre; β-cateninfx/fx embryos demonstrates that β-catenin expression is lost in many cells near the boundary of the midbrain and posterior diencephalon . otx <dig> is expressed in the forebrain and midbrain and is necessary for forming the isthmic organizer at the midbrain/hindbrain boundary . during rathke’s pouch induction, otx <dig> is expressed in the infundibulum and more posterior regions of the ventral diencephalon, but is excluded from the neural ectoderm rostral to the infundibulum  <cit> . at e <dig>  otx <dig> is strongly expressed in the posterior diencephalon, but has a lower level of expression in the infundibulum . in wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos otx <dig> is strongly expressed in the infundibulum and a domain of weaker otx <dig> expression is observed rostral to the infundibulum . lef <dig> is expressed in the premamillary region of the developing hypothalamus  <cit> . this domain of lef <dig> expression is not contiguous with the infundibulum . in wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos the boundary of lef <dig> expression is displaced rostrally and corresponds to the caudal edge of the infundibulum . these results demonstrate that the patterning of the entire posterior ventral diencephalon, including the pituitary organizer, is shifted rostrally when β-catenin is deleted by the wnt1-cre.fig.  <dig>

the pattern of lacz expression in the e <dig>  wnt1-cre; rosastoplacz pituitary suggests that the neural crest contributes to the pituitary vasculature . therefore, we examined the pituitary vasculature in both models of neural crest deficient embryos using immunostaining for cd <dig> , an endothelial cell marker . the blood vessels in the pituitary glands of both the wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx and p0-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos are abnormally dilated at e <dig>  . endothelial cells appear to be migrating into the forming pituitary anterior lobe at e <dig>  . neither this pattern nor the size of the forming endothelium is disrupted in p0-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos, suggesting that the early migration of endothelial cells into the pituitary anterior lobe is unaffected by the loss of the neural crest . pericytes are cells that wrap around the endothelium and regulate blood vessel diameter, and the pericytes of the head are neural crest-derived  <cit> . pericytes express pdgfrβ at e <dig>  in wild type mouse embryos . this pericyte marker is absent in p0-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos, confirming that the loss of neural crest cells results in a loss of pituitary gland pericytes . pdgfβ−/− or pdgfrβ−/− mice develop dilated and leaky vasculature throughout the body that is similar to the vascular defects we observed in the pituitary glands of the p0-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos .fig.  <dig>

discussion
the developing pituitary gland is surrounded by head mesenchyme, which has a dual origin from definitive mesoderm and neural crest  <cit> . using two different neural crest expressing transgenic cre lines, we have shown that at axial levels the head mesenchyme on the rostral side of rathke’s pouch is of neural crest origin. this result is in agreement with previous fate mapping experiments of the neural crest derived head mesenchyme  <cit> . the mesenchyme on the caudal side is derived from definitive mesoderm; the rostral end of the notochord and the prechordal mesoderm is located on the caudal side of rathke’s pouch  <cit> . at more lateral levels the boundary between neural crest and definitive mesoderm is still present, but the definitive mesoderm can migrate to the rostral side of rathke’s pouch. the separation between head mesenchyme of neural crest and definitive mesoderm origins on either side of the pituitary gland presents intriguing possibilities for differential effects of these mesenchymal populations on pituitary gland organogenesis. for instance, stimulation of notch signaling in the ventral diencephalon reduces fgf <dig> expression in the pituitary organizer, which reduces lhx <dig> expression in rathke’s pouch and increases apoptosis  <cit> . lhx <dig> expression is reduced preferentially on the caudal side of rathke’s pouch and apoptosis is preferentially increased  <cit> . the differential effects on rathke’s pouch may be caused by signals from the definitive mesoderm, which are not expressed in the neural crest derived mesoderm.

mesenchyme is known to be important for pituitary induction  <cit> , but the specific factors involved and source of mesenchyme were unexplored. to address the role of neural crest derived mesenchyme on pituitary organogenesis we examined mouse embryos deficient in neural crest. intriguingly, ablation of neural crest using two different promoters to drive cre-mediated excision of β-catenin produced two different pituitary phenotypes. wnt1-cre mediated deletion of β-catenin in the neural crest produced rathke’s pouch and pituitary anterior lobe dysmorphology, without an effect on cell specification, while p0-cre mediated deletion had no effect at all, despite equally effective neural crest cell ablation. the dysmorphic pituitary caused by wnt1-cre is likely attributable to expansion of the pituitary organizer, including excess bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> expression, leading to additional oral ectoderm being induced to form rathke’s pouch. this phenotype is similar to other models of pituitary organizer expansion that result in an enlarged rathke’s pouch .

we considered three possibilities for how wnt1-cre mediated inactivation of β-catenin could result in a dysmorphic pituitary, and tested these possibilities by using the shh-cre and p0-cre. the data from each experiment is summarized in table  <dig>  the first possibility we considered is that the neural crest pattern the ventral diencephalon, including establishing the rostral boundary of the pituitary organizer, and that neural crest deficient embryos result in a pituitary organizer boundary shift. the neural crest regulate patterning of the forebrain and midbrain , and could potentially affect patterning in the ventral diencephalon. however, p0-cre, which effectively ablates β-catenin in the neural crest, does not induce expansion of rathke’s pouch. therefore, the loss of neural crest cells is unlikely to cause the expansion of the pituitary organizer.table  <dig> summary of pituitary phenotypes when β-catenin is deleted with specific transgenic cre lines

the second possibility is that modest, ectopic deletion of β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon causes expansion of the pituitary organizer. tcf7l <dig>  is a transcription factor that is activated by β-catenin, and tcf7l2−/− and wnt5a−/− embryos both have an expansion of the pituitary organizer that leads to a dysmorphic pituitary  <cit> . these precedents support the idea that the mosaic deletion of β-catenin in a few patches within the ventral diencephalon could be recapitulating the wnt5a and tcf7l <dig> phenotypes. however, wnt1-cre and shh-cre mediate similar mosaic, ectopic β-catenin deletion in the ventral diencephalon, but only wnt1-cre causes a phenotype. in addition, β-catenin is only ablated in a few cells of this tissue by either cre strain. taken together, these facts argue against the possibility that the pituitary phenotype is caused by deletion of β-catenin in the ventral diencephalon.

the third possibility is that wnt1-cre mediated deletion of β-catenin in the midbrain results in a rostral shift of the pituitary organizer. the major difference in expression between the wnt1-cre and the p0-cre is the expression of the wnt1-cre in the midbrain. our wnt1-cre fate mapping studies demonstrate that the wnt1-cre is also active in the posterior diencephalon. when β-catenin is deleted in the midbrain and posterior diencephalon the patterning of the entire ventral diencephalon is shifted rostrally, including the pituitary organizer, resulting in a dysmorphic rathke’s pouch. previous studies have demonstrated that loss of wnt <dig> or β-catenin in the mesencephalon causes a loss of midbrain identity and expansion of the hindbrain  <cit> . wnt <dig> plays a critical role in establishing the isthmic organizer at the boundary between the between the midbrain and hindbrain  <cit> . initial characterization of wnt1−/− embryos did not identify a disruption in forebrain patterning. examination of images in a previous characterization of wnt1−/− embryos  <cit> , suggests that rathke’s pouch is expanded in these embryos. our data indicates that canonical wnt signaling is not only necessary for midbrain-hindbrain boundary formation, but also proper patterning of the ventral diencephalon.

in comparison to the ectodermal structures of the pituitary gland, very little is known about the contributions of the head mesenchyme to pituitary development. chick explant studies demonstrate a permissive role of mesenchyme in pituitary cell specification, and a potential inductive role of the notochord in rathke’s pouch formation  <cit> . a mesenchymal signaling component is also supported by genetic studies in mice, where loss of foxd <dig> in the mesenchyme results in an increase in pituitary anterior lobe cell number and a decrease in lhβ expression  <cit> . it is not known what the actual mesodermal signal is that regulates pituitary development. the bmp antagonist chordin is expressed in the prechordal mesoderm of mouse embryos, adjacent to the caudal side of rathke’s pouch  <cit> . the prechordal plate also expresses noggin, and mice that are chrd−/−; nog+/− develop holoprosencephaly, indicative of midline patterning defects  <cit> . the chrd−/−; nog+/− embryos do not express nkx <dig>  in the ventral diencephalon, which leads to a loss of fgf <dig> expression in the pituitary organizer and loss of rathke’s pouch  <cit> . these results demonstrate that the prechordal plate is necessary for establishing the pituitary organizer in the ventral diencephalon, which then induces rathke’s pouch. direct effects of prechordal plate signaling on development of the pituitary anterior lobe are unknown.

to begin determining what functions the head mesenchyme might play in pituitary organogenesis, we fate mapped the neural crest derivatives near the pituitary gland. our results unequivocally demonstrate that the neural crest produce the head mesenchyme on the rostral side of rathke’s pouch, and form a sharp boundary with definitive mesoderm on the caudal side of rathke’s pouch. while this boundary has been observed surrounding the eye, our results refine the position of the boundary in relation to the pituitary gland with a sharp demarcation occurring at the site of rathke’s pouch invagination  <cit> . it is intriguing to speculate that rathke’s pouch may provide guidance cues to neural crest cell migration. characterization of the embryonic pituitary transcriptome identified  <dig> genes with gene ontology  terms related to cell adhesion and migration, including genes with known roles in neural crest migration  <cit> . analysis of these candidate genes may reveal differential expression within rathke’s pouch necessary for directing migrating neural crest cells to the rostral side.

a critical aspect of pituitary development is the delamination of cells from the tightly packed epithelium at the ventral side of rathke’s pouch, in a rostral direction, as they take on the shape typical of glandular cells, and form the rudimentary anterior lobe. this commences at approximately e <dig>  and continues through gestation. some neural crest derived mesenchyme cells invade the forming anterior lobe at e <dig> . this is the same time that vascular invasion is initiated . indeed, at later stages of pituitary development the neural crest derived mesenchyme exhibits a pattern reminiscent of vascular tissue. in the vertebrate head, pericytes, regulatory cells which wrap around endothelial cells, are derived from the neural crest  <cit> . the neural crest cells invading the anterior lobe are likely forming the pericytes of the pituitary gland. the vasculature of both wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx and p0-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos is dysmorphic and dilated, which is attributable to the lack of regulatory pericytes, as marked by pdgfrβ. dilated and leaky vasculature results when pericytes are not recruited to the endothelial cells  <cit> . the vasculature of the wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx and p0-cre; β-catfx/fx pituitaries recapitulates this phenotype and demonstrates a requirement for neural crest derived pericytes in pituitary vasculature formation.

neither the wnt1-cre; β-catfx/fx or p0-cre; β-catfx/fx embryos display a disruption in pituitary anterior lobe cell specification. therefore, the neural crest derived head mesenchyme is not necessary for normal anterior lobe cell specification. the axial mesoderm on the caudal side of rathke’s pouch is a rich source for developmental signals, which are known to pattern surrounding tissues, including the neural tube and paraxial mesoderm. rathke’s pouch sits at a dynamic site at the interface of definitive mesoderm, neural crest, neural ectoderm, and oral ectoderm. determining the precise molecular mechanisms that each of these tissues plays in pituitary organogenesis in mouse and other vertebrate model systems will help in determining how this vertebrate specific organ may have evolved.

CONCLUSIONS
using both the wnt1-cre and the p0-cre to lineage trace the neural crest, we determined that the mesenchyme on the rostral side of rathke’s pouch is neural crest in origin. this rostral mesenchyme contributes to the vasculature of the pituitary gland. deletion of a conditional null allele of β-catenin in the neural crest lineage using both the wnt1-cre and p0-cre generates mouse embryos that are deficient in neural crest cells  <cit> . these embryos have dysmorphic pituitary blood vessels and lack pdgfrβ labeled pericytes. the wnt1-cre is also active in the mesencephalon, while the p0-cre is not. loss of β-catenin in the mesencephalon causes a loss of midbrain structures  <cit> . in addition, we have determined that loss of β-catenin in the mesencephalon and posterior diencephalon is the likely cause of a rostral shift in the expression domain of bmp <dig> and fgf <dig> in the ventral diencephalon. the altered expression domain of these morphogenetic proteins results in a highly dysmorphic rathke’s pouch. therefore, β-catenin is required in the wnt <dig> expression domain, including the neural crest, for the proper specification of pituitary gland growth, development, and vascularization.
