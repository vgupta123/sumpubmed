BACKGROUND
the photoperiod pathway, which includes a number of genes that form its core, as well as input and output genes, is very important for angiosperms to flower at a precise time in a year  <cit> . the circadian-regulated gene constans  is a central regulator of this pathway, which coordinates light and clock inputs in leaves to trigger the expression of florigen gene flowering locus t   <cit> . in arabidopsis, a long-day  plant, the transcript peak of co mrna occurs late in the day in ld, but after dusk in sd  <cit> . co protein, in turn, is stabilized by light and rapidly degrades in darkness, and activates the expression of ft in ld conditions  <cit> . in rice, a short-day  plant, hd <dig>  the co ortholog, functions in the promotion of hd3a  expression in sd conditions, but in the inhibition of hd3a expression in ld conditions  <cit> . hd <dig> mrna begins to accumulate after dusk and decrease before dawn  <cit> . in populus trichocarpa, co-ft regulon also plays a pivotal role in flowering and controlling of a highly adaptive trait for forest trees  <cit> . the day-length flowering response in temperate cereals, such as wheat and barley, appears to involve the activation of an ft and ft-like  <dig>   <cit> . tahd <dig>  can complement the rice hd <dig> mutant  <cit> , and lpco <dig>  can rescue the co mutant phenotype  <cit> . thus, the co-ft regulon is conserved among angiosperms analyzed, even though it has different modes in different species.

co homologs belong to b-box family  family and are conserved in plants including algae  <cit> . the bbx  represents a subgroup of zinc finger proteins, which contain one or two b-box domains mediating protein-protein interactions in animals, yeast, and plants  <cit> . besides b-box domains in the n-termini, some members of bbx family have a c-terminal cct domain, which includes a nuclear import signal  <cit>  and a domain of interaction with the ubiquitin ligase cop <dig>  <cit> . co homologs can be sub-grouped into three major sub-types: type i with two b-box domains, type ii with one b-box domain, and type iii with one b-box domain and one degraded b-box domain  <cit> . some members of type i genes, such as co in a. thaliana, hd <dig> in rice, and pnco in pharbitis nil, control flowering in different plants  <cit> . the co homolog is also found in algae. crco from chlamydomonas reinhardtii can complement the arabidopsis co mutant and promote flowering  <cit> , indicating the function of co orthologs is ancient and conserved.

phosphatidyl ethanolamine-binding protein family  has now been identified in many kingdoms and their basic structures as well as sequences are evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . in plants, pebp genes are mainly classified into three clades: ft-like, tfl-like and mft-like clades  <cit> . mft-like is ancestral to the other two clades and shown to be involved in the development of reproductive tissues in moss or seed development and germination in seed plants  <cit> . several members of the tfl-like clade, such as cen from antirrhinum <cit>  and tfl <dig> from arabidopsis, have important roles in delaying flowering and maintaining indeterminacy of inflorescence meristem  <cit> . as a major component of florigen, ft-like genes mediate the onset of flowering through the photoperiod pathway, vernalization pathways, and other pathways in all angiosperms examined  <cit> . ft/tfl1-like genes, such as paftl <dig> and paftl <dig>  code for proteins with a tfl1-like function in gymnosperms  <cit> . taken together, the first duplication event resulting in two families of plant pebp genes  seems to coincide with the evolution of seed plants, in which independent control of bud and seed dormancy is required  <cit> . the second duplication resulting in the production of the ft-like and tfl1-like clades probably coincides with the evolution of angiosperms  <cit> . in addition, the similarity of amino acid among the ft- and ftl-like clades is high, and key amino acids are responsible for this functional divergence  <cit> .

gene duplications have occurred during plant speciation, and the generation of several paralogous copies allows gene diversification. paralogs may retain the function of the ancestral genes, and thus act redundantly and/or additively due to the increased protein dosage. but they may also develop non-, sub- or neo-functions  <cit> . in soybean, about 75% genes are present in multiple copies  <cit> , and about 50% of paralogs are differentially expressed. most of them have undergone sub-functionalization and only a small proportion of the duplicated genes have been neo-functionalized or non-functionalized  <cit> .

in this study, the evolutionary relationship between the bbx or pebp gene family and plant speciation was investigated at the genome level. and then co and ft orthologs were screened in the soybean genome. based on the phylogenetic and the collinear relationship,  <dig> of co orthologs  and  <dig> of ft orthologs  were identified in the soybean. finally, the detailed expression profiles of these genes in soybean and their flowering functions in arabidopsis were analyzed. the results suggest that in soybean there were more than one co and ft orthologs with the function of flowering control.

RESULTS
co-like genes are ancient, whereas ft-like genes are recent in plants
the profile-hmms for the bbx family  and the pebp family , including co-like and ft-like genes, respectively, were employed through hmmer to search candidate genes of the two families in plants with available genomes, including two monocots , three eudicots , four gymnosperms , one lycophyte , one moss , and six chlorophytes  . phylogenetic trees of the co-like and ft-like gene families were similarly reconstructed by mega  <dig>  with neighbor-joining method . meme and mast  were employed to investigate motifs and their organizations among different clusters of the bbx or pebp family, respectively .

different bbx clusters had completely diverged before the divergence of bryophytes and pteridophytes  <cit> . according to the phylogenetic tree  and their own motif organizations , the plant bbx family was grouped into seven clusters, cluster i through vii. among them, cluster i, iii, iv, vi, and vii can be found in the unicellular green algae and cluster ii and v first appeared in the moss plant. thus, seven bbx clusters appeared prior to the occurrence of land plants. based on the alignment results of smart , motifs mb <dig> and mb <dig> were equivalent to the b-box <dig> domain, and mb <dig> or mb <dig> to the b-box <dig> domain , and mb <dig> and mb <dig> to the cct domain. co homologs contained conserved b-box <dig> domain and cct-domain  <cit> .the members of cluster i, ii and iii also had both b-box <dig> and cct-domain, suggesting that the members of the three clusters were the co homologs. in addition, bbx cluster i contained co in arabidopsis <cit> , hd <dig>  in rice  <cit> , and crco  in a green algae  <cit> . thus, bbx cluster i contained the co orthologs from different species , indicating that they formed the conserved motifs and functioned prior to the divergence of algae and plants and were monophyletic.

co homologs probably represented as ancient regulators of photoperiod-dependent events  <cit> . functionally, crco from c. reinhardtii shows important roles in processes regulated by the photoperiod and the circadian clock  <cit> . in the moss p. patens, ppcol <dig>  expression is controlled by the circadian clock  <cit> . transcripts of pacol <dig> and pacol <dig> in picea abies can also be regulated by the photoperiod  <cit> . for the flowering plants, co and hd <dig>  display conserved functions in regulating the flowering time through affecting transcriptions of ft or hd3a under the ld or sd conditions, respectively  <cit> .

for the plant pebp gene family, the members could be grouped into two groups, group i and ii, with conserved motif organization, respectively . mft-likes, ft/tfl-likes, tfl-likes, and ft-likes belonged to group i. based on the phylogenetic tree , mft-like genes were presented in all the land plants, and may be the ancestral form of ft/tfl-like, tfl-like, and ft-like genes  <cit> . p. patens had only mft-like genes, whose expressions were regulated by circadian rhythm with maximum expressions in gametangia and sporophytes, indicating an involvement in the development of reproductive tissues in the moss  <cit> . similarly, the mft-like genes display important roles in the seed development or dormancy in angiosperms, but do not affect the flowering time  <cit> . before the appearance of seed plants, the function divergence of ft-like genes and tfl-like genes is not obvious, and the function of some pebp genes is close to tfl-like genes, although their sequences and key motifs are much similar to that of ft-like genes  <cit> . only in angiosperms, the function divergence of ft-like genes  and tfl-like genes  is significant as oppositely regulating the flowering time in monocots and eudicots  <cit> . in addition, tsf not only plays a role as a floral promoter in the photoperiod pathway redundantly with ft, but also makes a distinct contribution to arabidopsis flowering in sd conditions. tsf overexpression causes a precocious flowering phenotype independent of photoperiods and co or flc, indicating ft and tsf are differently regulated by distinct floral-inducing signals  <cit> . all above, ft-like genes are present as the main flowering regulator after the divergence of angiosperms and gymnosperms and show different functions from that of tsf-like genes.

taken together, co-lineage genes were present in different plants from the unicellular green alga to the flowering plant , and their functions were ancient and conserved. however, ft-lineage genes were functionally diverged from mft-like or tfl-like genes  when flowering plants occurred. thus, ft orthologs appeared later than co orthologs, and the co-ft regulon was a product of a very long evolutionary process. but the mechanism of co regulating the ft transcription was conserved in the angiosperm, and they functioned together as a co-ft regulon in regulation of the flowering time through a photoperiod-dependent mode  <cit> .

duplications of the co-ft regulon in the soybean evolution
in the soybean genome,  <dig> co-like genes in total, named as gmcol <dig> through  <dig>  can be grouped into cluster i, ii and iii , and most of them except for col <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> experienced wgd . three loci experienced the gamma wgt and two wgd events, and then resulted in gmcol1/2/5/ <dig> , gmcol6/19/21/22/ <dig> , and gmcol9/15/27/ <dig> , respectively . others were divergent after the glycine wgd event. evolutionarily, the soybean co orthologs may be anyone of cluster i, ii, and iii. however, based on the phylogenetic tree, gmcol <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> among  <dig> co-like genes were much closer to crco, co, and hd <dig> , which showed flowering activity in plants  <cit> . additionally, the syntenic blocks containing gmcol <dig> or  <dig> and gmcol <dig> or  <dig> in chromosomes were divergent after the legume wgd event according to the average ks values of homologous blocks  . therefore, gmcol <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were the good candidates of co orthologs in the soybean, which was consistent with jung et al.  <cit> . therefore, they were selected for further study here.

note: the homologous blocks, containing co or ft orthologs, were gained by mcscanx. average ks values of homologous blocks were the mean of ks values of paralogous gene pairs in blocks.

there were  <dig> ft-like genes in the soybean , and according to the collinear relationships  they can be grouped into two clades, one including gmftl <dig> to  <dig> and the other composing of gmtsf <dig> to  <dig>  compared with the previous results of kong et al. <cit> , gmftl <dig> to  <dig> were equivalent to gmftl3a, 3b, 2a, 5a, 2b and 5b, and gmtsf <dig> to  <dig> corresponded to gmftl1b, 1a,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. gmftl1- <dig> all experienced wgds as well as tandom duplications . gmftl <dig> with only a shortened pebp domain and lacking the n-terminal segment was diverged from its paralogous gene gmftl <dig> . however, gmftl <dig> was strongly expressed in most tissues detected and induced by the photoperiod . gmftl <dig>  and gmftl <dig>  coordinately control flowering and enable the adaptation of soybean to photoperiodic environments  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ft mainly functions in ld while tsf makes a distinct contribution only in sd conditions  <cit> , indicating the function of ft and tsf is divergent in regulating the flowering time. in soybean, gmtsf <dig> and - <dig> displayed much similar sequences with tsf. gmtsf3/ <dig> showed much similar sequences with ft than that with tsf , but they should be the tsf lineage according to the collinear relationship . furthermore, ectopic expression of gmtsf <dig> and gmtsf <dig> in arabidopsis did not have flower-promoting activities under ld conditions , so did tsf in arabidopsis. thus, gmftl <dig> to  <dig> were here selected as soybean ft orthologs for further study.

expression divergences among the soybean co and ft paralogs showing spatio-temporal functions of co-ft regulons
in soybean, spatio-temporal expression profiles of four candidate co orthologs  and six ft orthologs  were investigated by quantitative real time rt-pcr at the stages of seedling and flowering under sd conditions .

the transcript of gmcol1/ <dig> accumulated much more than that of gmcol5/ <dig> in most tissues tested, and the expressions of gmcol <dig> and gmcol <dig> did not show tissue-specific, while gmcol <dig> and gmcol <dig> displayed distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns. for example, the expression of gmcol <dig> was not detected in roots at the seedling stage, in the stems at flowering, and in pods at  <dig> and  <dig> daf  . and transcripts of gmcol <dig> were undetectable in unifoliolates, cotyledons, and hypocotyls . gmcol <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were expressed in cotyledons and unifoliolates at the seedling and flowering stages . for the photoperiod-sensitive plant, the photoperiodic signals at the seedling stage are important to regulate flowering time. these results indicated that gmcol <dig> may not be the key gene of photoperiodic responses during the early stage of floral induction in soybean.

the expressions of gmftl <dig> and gmftl <dig> were undetectable in unifoliolates, but they strongly expressed in trifoliolates at the flowering time, and transcripts of other four gmftls were lower in leaves at the seedling stage than that at the flowering time . so, soybean gmftl genes were induced along with developmental progress. amongst the six soybean ftl genes, gmftl <dig> showed higher expression level compared to that of the other genes in most of the tissues examined , suggesting that gmftl <dig> was very important to promote flowering in soybean, as indicated by kong et al.  <cit> . gmftl <dig> also was constitutively expressed but at relatively lower level compared with gmftl <dig>  in the seedling stage, gmftl <dig> and  <dig> were expressed at higher levels than their paralogs, gmftl <dig> and gmftl <dig>  respectively. gmftl <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were strongly expressed in cotyledons , which can produce sufficient ft proteins to induce flowering in arabidopsis <cit> , suggesting that these three genes were important for floral induction at the early stages of soybean development. gmftl <dig> was expressed at low levels and was not detected in shoot apical meristems , cotyledons, and hypocotyls at the seedling stage as well as stems at the flowering stage . the expression of gmftl <dig> was the highest one among six soybean ftl genes in roots at the seedling stage, but no expressions were detected in roots at the flowering stage . noticeably, expressions of gmftl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were detected in flowers, and gmftl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed in pods , suggesting that ftl genes kept the ancient function of the pebp family and may be important in reproductive development.

co regulates ft mainly in leaves, the receptors of photoperiod signals. soybean unifoliolates only were competent for receiving the signal of sd to promote flower initiation and 3 days of short-day treatment were sufficient for floral induction  <cit> . as figure  <dig> shown, the transcripts of gmcol1/2/ <dig> and gmftl3/4/5/ <dig> were detected in unifoliolate leaves at the seedling stage. in addition, cotyledons were shown to be another receptor of photoperiod signals besides leaves  <cit> . expectedly, gmcol1/2/ <dig> and gmftl1/2/3/4/ <dig> were expressed in the cotyledons at the seedling stage . combined results indicated that gmcol1/2/ <dig> and gmftl3/4/ <dig> had important roles in response to photoperiod at the soybean seedling stage.

the circadian rhythm of soybean co-ft regulons in leaves
to investigate the circadian rhythm of the candidate co-ft regulon genes, transcriptions of  <dig> genes were detected in the leaves at the stage of the first trifoliolate fully opening under sd  or ld  conditions . transcriptional circadian patterns of the paralog gene pair, gmcol <dig> and  <dig>  were very similar under both sd and ld conditions, and expression levels was much higher in sd conditions than ld conditions. their expression peaks were present at dawn, and after that their expressions decreased until dusk , which indicated that the two genes were strongly induced by darkness and inhibited by light. the expression rhythms of gmcol <dig> and  <dig> were similar to that of hd <dig> in rice, in which the abundance of hd <dig> mrna was restricted to the dark period under sd conditions  <cit> . in addition, expression patterns of ljcoa, one of four co homologs in lotus japonicus, were also similar to that of gmcol <dig> and  <dig> under sd or ld conditions  <cit> . compared to gmcol <dig> and  <dig>  gmcol <dig> and  <dig> were expressed at much lower level with different expression profiles in leaves . in addition, the expression levels of gmcol <dig> were ten folds higher than those of gmcol <dig>  although they showed similar expression patterns under sd or ld conditions. under sd conditions, expression peaks of gmcol <dig> and  <dig> occurred at dawn and zt <dig>  respectively. under ld conditions, one expression peak of gmcol <dig> and  <dig> occurred at zt <dig>  and the other at zt <dig> and zt <dig>  respectively .

according to the circadian rhythm of six soybean ft-like genes , five genes have similar expression patterns under sd conditions except gmftl <dig>  the expression of gmft1/2/4/5/ <dig> occurred at dawn and peaked at zt <dig> under sd conditions. but the expression peak of gmftl <dig> was at zt <dig> , which was consistent with previous reports in soybean  <cit>  and in rice  <cit> . under ld conditions, all six gmftl-like genes showed similar expression rhythms . for example, the expressions of six soybean ft-like genes reached to the maximum level at zt <dig> and zt <dig> 

according to the diurnal rhythms of four soybean co and six ft genes, gmcol <dig> and  <dig> showed similar expression patterns with gmftl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating that the paralogous gene pair gmcol <dig> and  <dig> have important roles in regulation of expressions of gmftl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and they may be composed of the soybean complicate and multiple co-ft regulons to sense the circadian and photoperiodic signals.

ectopic activity on arabidopsis flowering of gmcols and gmftls
in arabidopsis, the co paralog genes, col <dig> and col <dig>  have little effect on flowering time  <cit> , and other members of bbx cluster i genes, col <dig> and col <dig>  do not regulate the flowering time in arabidopsis <cit> . however, col <dig>  belonging to the bbx cluster ii, is involved in regulation of flowering time by repressing the expression of co, concomitantly reducing expressions of ft and delaying floral transition  <cit> . that indicates the functions of co-like genes are not redundant in controlling the flowering time, and it may resulte from the rapid evolution of co-like genes in plants  <cit> . to investigate the flowering functions of soybean co orthologs, gmcol <dig> and gmcol <dig> under control of camv 35s promoter were introduced into the co mutant , respectively. for gmcol <dig>  no significant changes in flowering time were detected in the over-expressing lines in ld conditions . by contrast, over-expression of gmcol <dig> was able to rescue the late-flowering phenotype of co mutant , indicating that gmcol <dig> gene may be a functional co ortholog in soybean.

ft and its orthologs are the universal and conserved promoters of flowering in different plants  <cit> . over-expressions of gmftl <dig>  or  <dig>  can promote the flowering in arabidopsis <cit> . to identify the flowering activity of soybean ft-like paralogs, all constructs of gmftl <dig> to  <dig> genes under control of camv 35s promoter were respectively introduced into arabidopsis ecotype columbia  . besides gmftl <dig> or  <dig>  other four soybean ftl genes can also change the flowering time of arabidopsis , suggesting that these paralogs of ftl genes may be functional ft orthologs in soybean. however, individual gmftl genes had their own specific functions, because their spatio-temporal expression patterns were quite different.

in arabidopsis, tsf and ft are differently regulated by distinct floral-inducing signals, so they show different functions on flowering in different conditions  <cit> . functions of gmtsf <dig>  gmtsf <dig> and gmpebp <dig> in promoting flowering were further evaluated through heterologous over-expressions in arabidopsis under ld conditions. the results showed that no significant changes in flowering time were detected in over-expression lines of gmtsf <dig> and gmtsf <dig>  compared to arabidopsis wild type , suggesting that they may not be the ft-lineage genes. although gmpebp <dig> was much similar to ft in sequence , it was not clustered into the ft-like . and overexpression of gmpebp <dig> showed no effect on the flowering of arabidopsis , indicating that it also was not a functional ft gene.

conserved subcellular localization of soybean co and ft-lineage proteins
constructs of gmcol <dig>  gmcol <dig>  and gmftl <dig> to  <dig> genes tagged by a reporter gene  at the n- or c-terminal were employed to investigate the subsucellular localization through the particle bombardment in the young soybean leaves. fluorescence signals of yfp-gmcol <dig> and yfp-gmcol <dig> were only present in the nucleus , which were similar to co homologous proteins in other species  <cit> . all six gmftl proteins also resembled to ft homologous proteins in other plants  <cit>  and localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus .

CONCLUSIONS
bbx gene family contained seven clusters and the co-homolog cluster were diverged from other clusters at the occurrence of plants. pebp gene family had three groups and ft-lineage genes were diverged from mft- and tfl-lineage genes at the occurrence of angiosperms. the role of the co-ft regulon in photoperiodic regulation of flowering time was conserved, although the evolutionary rates of co- and ft-lineage genes were different in angiosperms. in soybean, an ancient co-lineage gene experienced three polyploidy events, and then formed four candidate of co genes, gmcol <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  six ft-lineage genes, gmftl1- <dig>  were from an ancient locus prior to the wgt event. based on the spatio-temporal expression profiles, gmcol1/2/ <dig> and gmftl3/4/ <dig> were shown to play important roles in responses to photoperiod at the seedling stage. gmcol <dig>  gmftl <dig> to  <dig> showed flowering activity in arabidopsis, suggesting that at least these genes may be the candidates of functional co-ft regulons in soybean. therefore, the co-ft regulon in soybean was complicate and had multiple ones instead of a single one as in arabidopsis, which may function synergistically in a spatio-temporal mode to control photoperiodic flowering.
