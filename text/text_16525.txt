BACKGROUND
the completion of the grapevine  genome sequence  <cit>  and subsequent research to elucidate gene function and molecular mechanisms involved in plant development, yield and quality represent a milestone in the genomics of fruit tree species. transcriptomic and functional analyses have greatly contributed to the description of the gene regulatory network underlying grapevine development  with a particular focus on berry ripening, due to its relevance in wine production and fresh fruit consumption. vast collections of grapevine cultivars exist, making grapevine a model fruit tree species that offers the scientific community the opportunity to study genetic diversity.

many studies have shed light on the regulatory layer mediated by small rnas,  revealing their crucial role in the genetic programming and fine tuning of plant biology. micrornas  are a class of small rnas  coded by specific endogenous genes, which act as negative gene regulators. mirnas guide mrna cleavage, translational repression and chromatin modification of corresponding target genes  <cit>  and are involved in a variety of developmental processes, which include organ morphogenesis , transition from vegetative to reproductive plant growth  <cit>  and responses to stress . other classes of small rnas are involved in regulating genome methylation levels, and genome stability, thus keeping transposon and repetitive elements silent  <cit> .

considering the role that mirnas and other small regulatory rnas play in plant biology, any comprehensive genomic description should include a detailed structural and functional characterization of these regulatory molecules. it is necessary to detail the regulatory layer mediated by these molecules in grapevine, as well, not only because of its great economic importance, but also because grapevine has a complex life cycle, thus providing the opportunity to explore different developmental stages spanning a two-season period. next generation sequencing technologies have strongly favoured the analyses of small rna regulatory networks, detecting rare molecules and small rna variants with unprecedented precision and sensitivity. there is a relatively large number of grapevine mirnas deposited in mirbase  and/or reported in the literature . their expression profile has been analyzed in a few critical tissues/organs, predominantly in developing berries and flowers.

here we describe a genome-wide transcription atlas of mirnas in grapevine, analyzing the spatio-temporal distribution of known and newly discovered mirnas, in the widest range of grapevine samples considered thus far. the identification of targets mrna by in silico prediction methods complements our characterization of the mirna transcriptome and deepens our understanding of the biological functions of mirnas in grapevine development.

our aim is to establish a reference for the future development of targeted functional studies of mirna regulation.

one database was established using the grapevine genome, and made available on the website , in order to store and assist the visualization of all the sequenced libraries.

approximately  <dig>  billion small rna raw reads were produced. adapter sequences were recognized and trimmed from  <dig> , <dig> raw reads which correspond to  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences, ranging from  <dig> to 34 nt . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads represented by  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences were perfectly mapped to the v. vinifera pn <dig> reference genome  <cit> , excluding reads mapping to rrna, trna, snrna, and snorna sequences.

in most samples, mapped reads show a similar pattern of size distribution, with distinct peaks at  <dig> and 24 nt , in agreement with known products of dicer-like  protein cleavage. in particular, the 24 nt-long molecules were the most abundant class in latent buds, flowers  and floral organs, such as carpels and stamens. the predominance in floral tissues of the 24 nt molecules, already described in grapevine by wang et al.  <cit> , may reflect the shift of the small rna population towards sirnas during plant development, shift linked to transposons and repeated sequences. the remaining samples had the highest proportion of 21 nt-long sequences, typically represented by mirnas. the 21 nt class showed the highest degree of redundancy, suggesting that they derive from precursors which produce well-defined short sequences, whereas the 24-nt class showed a lower redundancy, indicating their origin in loci producing populations of heterogeneous small rna molecules. size profiling indicated an insufficient quality for further quantitative analyses of a few libraries , namely those derived from roots, leaves in senescence, young leaves, woody stems, pollen, post-harvest berries and seeds, which were used only to identify known vvi-mirnas and to predict novel mirna candidates, but not for the expression analysis. these libraries did not present the typical 2-peaks profile expected in angiosperms  <cit>  for small rna sequencing data and/or were not sufficiently abundant in terms of distinct genome matched reads .fig.  <dig> size distribution of small rnas from all samples of grapevine. x-axis: length in nucleotides ; y-axis: summed normalized abundances for each size class as an average of two biological replicates. library codes are indicated in table 1




identification of annotated and novel grapevine mirnas
we applied a powerful mirna identification pipeline, developed by jeong, zhai and collaborators  <cit> , successfully applied to several species , to our set of  <dig> small rna libraries in order to identify already annotated mirnas  and to discover novel candidates.

we fed the pipeline with  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> distinct small rna sequences from the  <dig> libraries of cultivar corvina and the two libraries of clone pn <dig>  respectively.

first, we searched for known vvi-mirnas in the corvina data set and identified  <dig> unique sequences, representing  <dig> out of  <dig> known mature vvi-mirnas. we manually investigated all the  <dig> known mirna loci identified in the corvina libraries, checking for the existence of the correct precursor and whether the annotated mirnas corresponded to the most abundant one. we retrieved the highest abundant sequence and, when possible, also the complementary 3p or 5p sequence. for twenty-three mirnas the most abundant sequence appeared as a different variant  of the annotated mirna, showing different length or a shift of the map position in the precursor . for instance, the annotated sequence of vvi-mir171b showed an abundance of only  <dig> tp5m, whereas its variant, which starts 3 bp downstream of the annotated one, had an abundance of  <dig> tp5m. the 3 bp shift of vvi-mir171b was already observed and deposited in mirbase. a difference in length was noted for  <dig> vvi-mirnas from ten families . in line with jeong et al.  <cit> , devers et al.  <cit>  and marco et al.  <cit> , we observed cases where the complementary sequence of the annotated vvi-mirna was more abundant than or as abundant as the annotated sequence, suggesting that complementary sequences might have biological functions. this was true for five members of the vvi-mirna <dig> family, for vvi-mir398a, vvi-mir <dig>  and vvi-mir <dig>  for three other loci, vvi-mir159c, vvi-mir169w and vvi-mirna <dig>  we found two distinct duplexes produced from the same precursor, which we designated as vvi-mir159c. <dig>  vvi-mir169w. <dig> and vvi-mirna <dig>  . the sequencing reads originating from vvi-mirna159c and vvi-mirna169w were arranged in phase, either in tandem  or separated by a gap of  <dig> nucleotides . in contrast, the two duplexes produced by vvi-mirna <dig> had a 13 bp overlapping region, and the most sequenced reads corresponded to the not annotated reads, as observed for the vvi-mirna169w locus.

in conclusion, we confidently identified  <dig> unique, known sequences, corresponding to  <dig> known mature vvi-mirnas from which,  <dig> also had the complementary  sequence identified . these identified vvi-mirnas belong to  <dig> conserved plant mirna families. seven grapevine mirna known families , were not identified in our libraries.

for the identification of novel mirnas, the previous pipeline was used with corvina and pn <dig> libraries as input. in total,  <dig> unique mirna candidates generated from  <dig> precursors were kept. these candidates were compared to those in mirbase identifying  <dig> sequences with >90% similarity to known plant mirnas,  <dig> were new members of  <dig> known vitis families, and  <dig> candidates were members of  <dig> new vitis families . after subtracting these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> completely novel grapevine mirna candidates were retained.

interestingly, we found two new members of the mirna <dig> family, vvi-mirc172e and vvi-mirc172f, in antisense to vvi-mir172b and vvi-mir172a respectively. the 3’ sequences produced from both antisense duplexes were predicted to target apetala <dig>  gene and other ap2-related genes, which are already well known targets of the mirna <dig> family . as for the 5’sequences of the duplexes, both had the dna-directed rna polymerase iii subunit c <dig> as a predicted target .

for the identification of completely novel mirnas candidates, in order to prevent the selection of sirna-like mirnas, we selected from the list of candidates passing the pipeline’s filters, only  <dig>   <dig> and 22 bp long candidates. their precursor secondary structures were then inspected manually . our analyses indicated that  <dig> novel vvi-mirna candidates   matched the criteria for mirna annotation  <cit> . for ten sequences the complementary sequence  was also retrieved with a high abundance, and is, hence, reported in additional file  <dig>  as observed in conserved mirnas, around 45%  of novel candidates began with a 5' uridine, which is a characteristic feature of mirnas .

finally, we compared our novel mirna candidates with those reported previously in grapevine, and not deposited in mirbase  cross checking sequences, allowing some nucleotide shift, and, when available, the genomic coordinates. only  <dig> mirnas were previously identified. the mature sequences of  <dig> out of these candidates, were commonly retrieved in  <cit> , while no sequences/precursors were in common with  <cit> .

in silico identification of target genes
we predicted the targets for all the mirna set here identified, comprising a total of  <dig> mirna sequences . a total of  <dig> predicted targets were retrieved using targetfinder  <cit> . only targets with a score of  <dig>  were considered and further investigated . on average, for each mirna sequence, two targets were found, but we observed several cases in which one mirna targets up to ten distinct coding genes. since in silico prediction of mirna targets is prone to false positive targets  <cit> , to optimize both accuracy and sensitivity we checked our results with psrnatarget, a second in silico pipeline  <cit> . seventy-one per cent of the predicted targets shown in additional file  <dig> were confirmed .

for each predicted mirna:target pair, we calculated the pearson correlation between the level of expression of the mirna  and the expression values of the target gene available from the cv. corvina transcriptomic atlas  <cit> . considering all the common sample shared between our atlas and  <cit> , and a p-value cutoff of  <dig> , we identified the mirnas negatively correlated to their predicted targets 

expression analyses of corvina libraries
to evaluate the abundance of each mirna identified in our libraries, we used the normalized abundance  of each sequence in each library, which represents the relative cloning frequency. we considered, for further analyses, a mirna as expressed only when both biological replicates met the set threshold of  <dig> tp5m. accordingly, we eliminated only a few 3p or 5p sequences of known mirna and nearly  <dig> newly predicted mirnas that were below the set threshold. to establish the mirna expression atlas, we used sequencing data of our corvina libraries, discarding some samples that showed an insufficient sequencing-quality .

figure  <dig> shows the distribution of mirnas expressed in each of the  <dig> different samples considered. the number of expressed mirnas is relatively high in the  <dig> samples, ranging from  <dig> in ripening rachis to  <dig> in whole developed tendrils. forty four mirnas were classified as organ-specific , i.e. mirnas expressed exclusively in one organ, in at least one of its developmental stages. stamen and buds expressed the highest number of organ-specific mirnas. of the  <dig> stamen-specific mirnas, two have targets coding for a protein involved in tmv resistance , while two  have, among their targets, five genes coding for aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase homolog . interestingly, grape-m <dig> maps on chromosome five in a region where four out of the five targets map . thirty-eight mirnas were identified as common to all samples; a part from grape-m <dig>  3p and 5p sequence, all the other common mirnas belong to known mirna families.fig.  <dig> number of mirna expressed in  <dig> different grapevine samples used to define the atlas. x-axis: number of mirnas expressed in individual samples; y-axis: different samples. common refers to the number of mirna expressed in all the samples. total is the whole set of mirnas expressed above the set threshold of  <dig> tpm in both replicates

to deepen the analysis on mirnas distribution during plant development, we investigated each plant structure separately  considering the distinct time points sampled. mirnas expressed in all developmental phases of a given organ range from a minimum of  <dig> %  in rachis, to a maximum of  <dig> % in tendrils . in the six stages of berry development  <dig> mirnas  are in common. the number of mirnas present in only one developmental time point is very low, when compared to the total number of mirnas expressed in the sample.fig.  <dig> shared mirnas among the different developmental stage of each organ. the description of library codes is in table 1




we analyzed the top  <dig> expressed mirnas in each sample  to check whether the most abundant mirnas were shared among samples. our analysis showed that in fact highly abundant  mirnas are similar in almost all the samples, but stamen and carpels, with vvi-mir <dig> family being by far the most abundant , followed by vvi-mir3634-3p , by vvi-mir159c.1-3p and by the novel candidate grape-m <dig>  vvi-mir159c.1-3p and four different members of mir <dig> family , whose 3p sequence is predicted to target tcp4-like and a gamyb-like transcription factors, are the most expressed in stamen and carpel. vvi-mir159c.1-3p is not predicted to target a myb transcription factor, as is usual for mir <dig> molecules, but a gene encoding a lactoylglutathione lyase protein , putatively involved in plant tolerance to stresses.

to analyze the overall expression profile of all the mirnas in our atlas, we represented their expression values in a heat map, subjecting the normalized count of reads to hierarchical clustering . known mirnas , and candidate mirnas, putatively grapevine specific , were analyzed in two different heat maps, to reduce the complexity of the figure and allow the graphical representation of these two groups of mirnas whose average expression level is very different: above  <dig> tp5m for the group of known mirnas and below  <dig> tp5m for the novel mirnas. the expression profiles of the  <dig> novel candidates vvi-mirna revealed that nine novel candidates are relatively highly expressed in most of the  <dig> samples , while the remaining candidates showed a medium to low expression level, being enriched in few samples, such as grape-m <dig> and grape-m 3469-5p expressed in flowers at beginning of flowering and at full bloom , or as grape-m <dig> and grape-m <dig> expressed only in young inflorescences, and grape-m4553-5p and grape-m8278-5p, expressed in well developed tendrils, berry at veraison and berry at ripening . it is striking the presence of the  <dig> stamen-specific mirnas, all belonging to our novel candidate group. differently, the heat map representing the known mirnas  reveals a reduced level of organ/tissue specificity and a high expression of numerous families, often nearly ubiquitous. some mirnas are specific to a few groups of samples, such as vvi-mir395-3p, which is strongly regulated during flower and berry development, or mirc477-3p mainly expressed in berries and rachis, and mir <dig> a,b -5p expressed in developing rachis and flowers.fig.  <dig> heat map and hierarchical cluster analysis  of mirnas identified in corvina derived libraries. the hcl tree was generated with the average linkage clustering method. a: heat map with known mirnas including new members of known families. b: heat map with novel mirnas. mirnas with an abundance below the set threshold of  <dig> tp5m in both replicates were set to zero. mirnas that are zero in all the  <dig> samples were removed from these heat maps. red and white represent high and low expression, respectively



mirna profiles define organ identity
in order to define the relationships among the  <dig> different samples used in our atlas, a correlation matrix , a dendrogram and a pca  were established. the distance was calculated using one minus pearson correlation metric of normalized data, as explained in full details in methods, to evaluate the level of similarity among the samples from the mirna perspective. the correlation matrix identifies two main clusters : the first groups inflorescences, buds, tendrils and stem, the second includes all the developing berries and their respective rachis stages. the leaf is scarcely related to any of the samples, and far from the inflorescence/buds group. the carpel and stamen are part of a distinct group not correlated with any other tissue.fig.  <dig> clustergram and principal component analysis of the  <dig> different grapevine samples of the mirna atlas.  the picture reports the hierarchical clustering analysis for both samples and mirnas, the corresponding dendrogram and the data heat map. data were normalized as described in methods. the x-axis of each dendrogram is the  <dig> minus pearson correlation distance metric. we used an optimal leaf order value which determines the leaf order that maximizes the similarity between neighbouring leaves.  a pca analysis has been performed on the dataset. data were preliminarily z-scored. x-axis represents the first components and the y-axis the second component. the two components explain  <dig> % of total variance. each organ is associated to the same colour and ovals indicate clusters approximately related to organ identity. blue for reproductive organs, purple for berries, red for leaf, orange for buds, yellow for stem and tendrils, light green for inflorescences and dark green for rachis. the same colours are used in the dendrogram. each color represents a different cluster. one minus pearson correlation was used as a metric distance



dendrogram and pca analyses  are consistent with correlation matrix, revealing the existence of the following functional groups: a) reproductive organs ; b) leaves; both less correlated to the other following groups: c) green and maturing berries; d) rachis; e) inflorescences and opened flowers; f) buds and g) other green tissues. these analyses suggest that mirnas reflect the functional specificity of different organs, as developmental stages of the same organ, and organ with a similar function are mainly grouped together, with few exceptions: well developed tendril that is closed to rachis, and not to other green tissues, the rachis at ripening stage and the woody bud that are less correlated to other rachis and buds samples, respectively.

expression of mirnas in berries and inflorescences
considering the wide spectrum of sampling in our atlas, we focused on the spatio-temporal modulation of mirna across inflorescences and berries development. we compared the abundance level of each mirna  among the four stages of inflorescences and, separately, among the six stages of developing berries. we investigated which mirnas showed a fold change of at least five in at least one of all possible comparisons . additionally, we performed real time pcr  for eight of these mirnas to confirm their abundance patterns .fig.  <dig> heat map and hierarchical cluster analysis  of mirnas with fold change greater than five. a: berries, b: flower tissues. the hcl tree was generated with the average linkage clustering method. dark grey  and white represent high and low expression, respectively

in inflorescences, the well-known regulatory circuit involving mir <dig> and mir <dig> is confirmed by both sequencing and rt-qpcr data . as observed in other species , in grapevine an increase in mir <dig> levels corresponds to a low expression of mir <dig> and viceversa. from our data, mir <dig> family members target nine different spl genes, six of which are negatively correlated to vvi-mir <dig> when considering their abundances .

other two interesting mirnas are vvi-mir <dig> and vvi-mir <dig>  both involved in auxin signalling regulation, are up-regulated during inflorescence and flower development . mir <dig> regulates the auxin response factor  through trans-acting sirna locus  <dig> , as experimentally validated in  <cit> , while mir <dig> targets the auxin receptor tir and an f-box protein  <cit>  highlighting the importance of auxin regulation during flower development. other conserved mirnas, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  show an interesting pattern of abundance in inflorescences , although their involvement in flower development is not clear. our data show that mir171h decreases during inflorescence development, as already shown in prunus  <cit> : in both prunus and vitis mir <dig> targets a gras family transcription factor, and from our data vvi-mir171b is negatively correlated to its predicted target vit_202s0154g <dig> . mir <dig> family members are expressed in the young inflorescences  and are then shut down in subsequent developmental stages. it is worth noting that while in open blooming flowers mir <dig> is below the set threshold of expression, its abundance is very strong in stamen  and especially in carpel , sampled from the same open flowers  this mirna is also present in the berry at the fruit-set stage, peaking at pre-veraison , and decreasing from veraison through maturation, as already observed in our previous analyses  <cit>  that suggests a role for this mirna, regulating sulphate metabolism, at fruit setting and veraison.

among the newly discovered mirnas, showing a minimum fold change of five during flower development, we wish to highlight the role of grape-m <dig>  discussed later, and grape-m <dig>  this mirna is below the set threshold of expression in the inflorescences  and is expressed at higher levels  in flowers at the beginning of flowering and in open flowers ; it targets genes annotated as encoding aphosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, known to mediate pollen tube growth in arabidopsis and nicotiana tabacum  <cit> .

considering the six developmental stages of the berry and the relative heat map  we found some conserved mirnas that reveal an interesting pattern of relative abundance. first of all, as observed in inflorescences, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are inversely correlated, and seem to be actively involved in fruit maturation: vvi-mir <dig> shows a gradual increase during ripening , with a corresponding decrease of vvi-mir <dig>  furthermore, vvi-mir <dig>  which targets growth regulating factor genes  appears to be involved in berry development. even though some discrepancies are visible between rt-qpcr and deep sequencing , both analyses indicate a clear reduction in abundance of this mirna after veraison, when the berries enter the second growth phase, doubling their volume.

vvi-mir166c/d/e/f/g/h/i-3p abundance profile is noteworthy: this molecule is the most abundant in our sequenced libraries. it shows a decrease after fruit set , and peaks at veraison . real time pcr  does not show a strong increase at veraison, nor a peak at pre-veraison stage, raising some doubts on the huge abundance shown by sequencing . among newly discovered mirnas, grape-m <dig> is interesting in the context of both flower and berry development. it is switched off only in open flowers  and it accumulates  in carpels, and, later in development, shows a peak  in berries at the fruit-set . it is then nearly switched off  after veraison. this mirna targets genes coding for enzymes  involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, such as flavonoids and anthocyanin. the dfr gene transcript  is negatively correlated to its mirna grape-m <dig> , considering their relative abundances, thus reinforcing our in silico target prediction.

discussion
to comprehensively define and describe the genetic programming of grapevine biology and development, it is important to extensively study genetic and epigenetic regulations driven by mirnas, the most representative class of small non-coding rnas. with the grapevine genome sequenced  <cit>  and the extensive advances in next generation sequencing technologies, numerous mirnas have been predicted in grapevine . however, all these studies are based on few grapevine samples, mainly berries, inflorescences, leaves or tendrils at one/two developmental stages; therefore an expression atlas, covering a much wider spectrum of plant structures during grapevine life cycle, is required to provide a detailed overview of mirna regulation and a solid base for functional studies.

mirna populations in grapevine
the sequencing of  <dig> small rna libraries, constructed from samples of corvina cv. and the clone pn <dig>  produced a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads respectively. taking into consideration the enormous inventory of small rnas in plants and their huge complexity, the identification of a relatively small portion of mirnas from this vast stock posed a challenge  <cit> . by combining high-throughput data with a well-established and stringent bioinformatics pipeline and the in silico prediction of mirna targets, we studied  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel vvi-mirna.

the conserved vvi-mirnas identified represent  <dig> families out of the  <dig> annotated in grapevine. the absence, in our data, of  <dig> annotated mirna families is ascribed to their low abundance in the analyzed samples , or to their nature of sirna-like mirnas, since most of them are not annotated with high confidence in mirbase . however we cannot rule out the possibility of differences between the corvina cultivar and the reference genome sequence derived from the clone pn <dig>  for example, mir <dig> is present in our libraries, but was discarded by the pipeline because of a sub-optimal pairing between the mirna and its complementary sequence. mir <dig> was not found in any of our libraries, confirming previous papers  <cit>  and mirbase findings that report a very faint expression of vvi-mir845a and vvi-mir845b.

of the  <dig> novel grapevine mirna candidates unravelled and described in our analysis,  <dig> showed similarity with other plant mirnas deposited in mirbase. interestingly, two of those were generated in antisense to two members of the vvi-mirna <dig> family: vvi-mirc172e and vvi-mirc172f were reverse complementary  to the known vvi-mir172b and vvi-mir172a, respectively. shao et al.  <cit>  reported these molecules in vitis as members of a novel category of mirnas, named rc-mirnas. they have a small regulatory activity by cleaving target mrnas, and might possess sirna-like activity by mediating dna methylation  <cit> . very few papers have reported this class of mirnas, first identified in animals . comparing novel mirnas identified in the present paper  with those reported from the hybrids of v. vinifera and v. labrusca  <cit>  and from other v. vinifera cultivars  <cit>  we found only  <dig> shared sequences. similarly, comparing our newly identified corvina and pn <dig> mirnas, only two mirnas are in common. these findings strongly suggest that, apart from a group of well-defined mirnas, each vitis variety and species has its own specific set of mirnas, or exhibit a different spatio-temporal pattern expression because of a different genetic background or an effect of genome plasticity, as already suggested by alabi and colleagues  <cit> .

moreover, our data reinforce recent findings that the population of mirnas is highly heterogeneous across species and varieties, since the processing of mirna precursors is not always precise and equal under every condition. we found different sequence variants  for each mirna and we also showed that in some loci, the sequence on the opposite arm of the annotated mirna  had a higher read number than their respective annotated sequence. although mirnas* was conventionally been thought to be degraded and non-functional  <cit> , it is now clear that they accumulate in the cells, and are able to down-regulate mrna targets . it was also shown that the protein complex guiding target inhibition  may be loaded with one or the other sequence of the mirna duplex  <cit> .

we found two conserved loci  and one vitis-specific locus  producing additional small rna duplexes besides the annotated ones . all the three alternative duplexes identified show a two-nucleotide 3’-end overhang, typical of rnase iii products and the vvi-mir159c and vvi-mir169w are arranged in phase  <cit> . the observation that multiple unique small-rna reads could be generated from the same mirna precursor has already been investigated by other authors  <cit> . much evidence suggests that these molecules, different from the canonical mature mirnas, widely exist in plants and some are actually authentic mirnas, with predicted targets.

fluctuations in mirna abundance define organ identity
we established a mirna expression atlas in the grapevine cultivar corvina, including  <dig> different samples, and  <dig> mirna sequences. this atlas, because of its dimension, represents a crucial step in the development of future targeted functional studies.

we analyzed the distribution of known and novel mirnas and their relative abundance, in several plant structures such as berries, inflorescences, tendrils, buds, carpels, stamens, leaf, stem and rachis.

considering the normalized mirna abundances, we observed that known and conserved mirnas are, on average, more abundant  than novel grapevine-specific mirnas , confirming that recently evolved molecules are less expressed and generally more tissue-specific  . moreover, the analysis of the top-most expressed mirnas suggests that mirnas expression trend is characterized by the presence of few abundant mirnas  , while the majority of the mirnas accumulates at a lower level in the different samples.

we then compared the distribution of the mirnas across our samples: the set of mirnas expressed appears highly variable: only  <dig> mirnas are expressed in all our samples and few mirnas are highly organ specific mirnas , with the exception of stamen, where  <dig> mirnas appear to be specific. wang and collaborators  <cit> , similarly, identified in grapevine a small number of tissue-specific mirnas, but a large number of mirnas expressed in all their six samples. this result is not in contrast with our findings, if we consider the higher number of samples used in the present work. indeed, if we consider only the various developmental stages of a given organ, we identify a high proportion  of expressed mirnas as shared among samples. this suggests that these mirnas are needed for organ-identity and functionality, and that less mirnas are involved in a specific developmental phase. rachis has a different behaviour, since only 30% of mirnas are shared among all the five stages considered, while many molecules are stage-specific  or shared by three or four stages . this would seem to indicate that different developing stages of rachis are characterized by a heterogeneous mirna population that drives a well-defined gene regulatory network.

hierarchical clustering analyses, together with pca and correlation matrix, sustain the evidences that mirnas influence organ identity, highlighting the similarities among grapevine samples derived from the same plant structure. the correlation matrix  together with the dendrogram  and the pca  show that stamen and carpel are distant from all other samples, and moderately related to each other. data from all our analyses suggest the presence of two major clusters: one including all the berries and their rachis, and the second comprising inflorescences, buds and the green vegetative tissues. leaf is always distant from the rest of the considered samples, closer to berries than to other green tissues.

these analyses suggest that fluctuations in the levels of the mirnas in different samples, without high organ specificity, may have a crucial functional role, in defining organ identity and developmental programming.

this observation differs from what described in fasoli et al.  <cit> , who performed a transcriptomics analysis on the same samples we used, showing that grapevine tissues undergo a transcriptional reprogramming during maturation. in their work, grapevine tissues were mainly clustered based on the maturity stage rather than organ identity, with green berries more similar to young leaves and tendrils than to ripe berries. this means that mirnas may act differently from other protein coding genes, establishing a regulatory layer that strictly influences organ identity.

mirna involved in berry and inflorescence development
the regulation of grapevine flowering is still poorly characterized  <cit> , and our results highlight some key regulatory steps driven by mirnas. similarly, our studies on berry development enrich present knowledge on mirna involvement in fruit  maturation, only partially disclosed in tomato  <cit> .

in inflorescence, a well recognized role is played by mir156-mir <dig> regulation: mir <dig> decreases during inflorescence development while mir <dig> increases . this is because spl, the target of mir <dig>  is an elicitor of mir <dig> promoter region which, in turn, targets apetala <dig>  this regulatory unit is fundamental for vegetative to reproductive changes and for the subsequent flowering onset and flower organ identity  <cit> . our data also suggest a role of mirnas in the hormonal regulation of floral development: in particular for auxin and ethylene. auxin-regulating mirnas are clearly modulated in our data: mir <dig>  targeting arf via ta-sirna production, and mir <dig>  targeting auxin receptors are both up-regulated  at late inflorescence development , with open flowers, thus suggesting a role for this hormone in the first stages of inflorescence development. a previous work in the hybrid summer black  showed a down-regulation of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in open flowers, compared to young inflorescences  <cit> . this difference could be an indication of a diverse mechanism governing auxin signalling during inflorescence development in the two vitis species. v. labrusca and v. vinifera were already shown to have a different auxin accumulation pattern, in berry development as well  <cit> . among the stamen specific mirnas, two mirnas  were predicted to target five acc oxidases, key enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis, suggesting a role for these mirnas in hormone regulation during anther and pollen development. in grapevine, ethylene production peaks at anthesis before berry fruit set , inducing fruitlet abscission  <cit> . subsequently, its level rises until pre-veraison stage, and declines at maturity  <cit> . ethylene treatment of berries at pre-veraison induces an over expression of numerous grapevine-specific mirnas  <cit> . although these mirnas were not detected in our libraries, this evidence supports the existence of ethylene responsive mirnas. the role of ethylene in anther development has not been extensively studied  <cit> . recently it was shown that acc oxidase gene is more expressed in female flowers of wild vitis than in hermaphrodite or male flowers, corroborating our hypothesis of an active role of ethylene in female structure development  <cit> . interestingly, grape-m <dig> maps in a chromosomal region where four out of its targets also map. a total of  <dig> genes coding for acc oxidase map in this region  suggesting that grape-m <dig> could have arisen from a tandem duplication of a target gene, followed by genetic drift, leaving only a short region of complementarity for the gene target, a mechanism suggested for mirna evolution  <cit> . among the newly discovered mirnas, we found that grape-m <dig> might be potentially involved in pollen growth, as it was predicted to target a gene coding for a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase  <cit> , responsible for the synthesis of the minor membrane phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol -  <dig> -bisphosphate. this enzyme is involved in the modification of the plasma membrane during pollen tube elongation. in agreement with this putative role, grape-m <dig> is expressed in open flowers and flowers at the beginning of blooming , but is absent in stamens and carpels. this observation suggests a role in confining the target gene expression in the organs where the pollen grains grow and develop the pollen tubes.

considering berry development, our atlas provides interesting hints on the maturation of a non-climacteric fruit, in which the regulatory role played by mirnas has been scarcely investigated. some of the most conserved mirnas reveal intriguing profiles: among others, mir <dig> and mir <dig> seem to be involved in berry maturation, in an ethylene independent manner. spl genes, targeted by vvi-mir <dig>  decrease during berry ripening in grapevine  <cit>  and, accordingly, we showed that vvi-mir <dig> is more expressed in the last stage of berry maturation. in tomato, an epimutation in an spl gene is responsible for cnr mutants, which result in colorless fruits with loss of cell-to-cell adhesion  <cit> . spl genes are upstream of ethylene synthesis in tomato, activating maturation through alternative programs  <cit> . furthermore, in arabidopsis, an over expression of mir <dig> determines a reduced spl genes activity and, by a subsequent regulation of several genes, lead to an accumulation of anthocyanins  <cit> , likely connected to dfr gene activation  <cit> , a flavonoid biosynthetic gene. these data reinforce the idea vvi-mir <dig> may be responsible for inducing maturation programs in grapevine berries, in an ethylene independent manner, through spl genes regulatory networks and anthocyanins accumulation, secondary metabolites accumulating in mature berries of red grapevine varieties.

vvi-mir <dig> is also modulated during berry development , confirming previous observations  <cit>  that show its gradual decrease during ripening. vvi-mir <dig> target gene is vvnac <dig>  <cit> , reported to increase during ripening  <cit> . interestingly, its tomato homolog lenor exerts a direct role in berry ripening progression, being upstream of ethylene regulatory signals such as cnr  <cit> 

considering the particular interest of secondary metabolites during berry maturation, and the large variety of phenylpropanoid compounds present in grapevine, two mirnas caught our attention because their abundance patter may indicate a connection of mirnas function to secondary metabolism. vvi-mir <dig>  whose abundance decreases from pre-veraison to maturity, as already reported in  <cit> , down-regulates a class 2-sulphate transporter and it has been usually involved in sulphur uptake and assimilation, or in nutrient starvation response . class  <dig> sulphate transporters were shown to be down-regulated during late berry maturation, reinforcing the role of sulphate metabolism in berry ripening  <cit> . the link between sulphur depletion and flavonoid and stilbene biosynthetic pathways was studied in grapevine by tavares et al.  <cit>  in both photosynthetic and non photosynthetic tissues. in this respect, it is plausible that mir <dig>  by regulating sulphate transporter, may be implicated in the activation of phenylpropanoid pathways.

the grapevine-specific mirna grape-m <dig>  whose expression peaks in carpels and in berries at fruit set, being down-regulated at the onset of ripening, was predicted, instead, to target seven genes  whose amino acid sequences share an identity ≥70% and are annotated as bifunctional dihydroflavonol 4-reductase flavanone 4-reductase-like  and cinnamoylcoa reductase-like proteins . dfr is a structural gene of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, specifically involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanins biosynthesis  <cit> , while ccr  might be involved in steroid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. brassinosteroids  are important regulators of ripening onset in grapevine  <cit> , and induce the expression of the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, such as dfr, when exogenously applied to berry skins  <cit> . br endogenous level during berry ripening in grapevine accumulates in flower and early berry development , and at late maturation stage  <cit> . accordingly, grapevine genes involved in br synthesis are up-regulated during berry development  <cit> . a reduction of grape- m <dig> abundance right at the onset of ripening could coincide with an activation of br synthesis and consecutively with berry maturation programs.

our results on mirna involvement in berry and inflorescence development highlight the importance of studying species-specific and conserved mirnas in the context of specific metabolic pathways, such as berry maturation and secondary metabolism, and in specific organs, such as stamen and carpel, to uncover new roles for mirnas, not limited to the conventional involvement in plant growth and development regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we applied next-generation sequencing technology to study mirna involvement in grapevine development. our small rna libraries, covering a large set of plant structures at different developing stages, allowed us to identify not only <dig> known mirnas but also  <dig> novel mirna candidates, considerably extending the number of mirnas described in grapevine.

our work assesses the spatio-temporal distribution of mirnas, defining the role of mirnas in sculpturing organ identity and fine tuning developmental programs. combining target prediction and expression profile, we shed light on the functional role of some mirnas adding insight on inflorescence and fruit development, reinforcing, among others, the role of the mir156/mir <dig> regulatory circuit in both inflorescence and berry development and suggesting a role of mirnas in regulating hormonal-driven fruit maturation and inflorescence development. for example, stamen specific mirnas are putatively involved in regulating ethylene production, stimulating stamen development.

our atlas aims at becoming the reference for the future development of targeted functional studies, a first indispensable step towards the definition of mirna involvement in grapevine development.
