BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  infection is characterized by reproductive failure in sows, and is associated with respiratory problems in pigs of all ages  <cit> . with few exceptions, prrsv is present in a majority of swine-producing countries around the world and gives rise to significant economic losses in the swine industry  <cit> . based on genetic and antigenic analysis, two prrsv genotypes are recognized: a european  genotype   <cit>  and a north american  genotype , which share about 55–70% nucleotide homology  <cit> . however, a high genetic variability has been demonstrated within both genotypes  <cit>  and the genetic differences between virus variants are mirrored in different virulence, pathogenicity, immunogenicity, … a recent study by diaz et al.  showed that infection with different prrsv strains leads to different virological and immunological outcomes and results in different degrees of homologous and heterologous protection  <cit> . another study by martinez-lobo and coworkers  reported that different prrsv isolates differ in their susceptibility to antibody neutralization  <cit> . evidently, the high variability of the virus represents a major hurdle for effective prrsv prevention and control  <cit> . since prrsv poses a serious burden on the swine industry worldwide, the need for efficient control measures is high. a variety of prrs eradication strategies have been described, including total depopulation/repopulation, partial depopulation, segregated early weaning, test and removal and herd closure. also planned exposure to a farm-specific virus isolate is a common strategy in the united states and canada  <cit> . this last approach is often performed without monitoring and is consequently unreliable in getting the targeted population homogeneously infected in a timely manner. while the above strategies can certainly be useful, it is also clear that efficient prrsv vaccines are extremely valuable tools to minimize the clinical and economical impact of prrsv infections. however, the commonly used vaccines, both attenuated and inactivated, are not without their problems. although attenuated vaccines have the potential to protect animals against viremia, the degree of protection depends on various factors, including the homology between the vaccine virus and the circulating virus  <cit> . in addition, there are some safety concerns, as the vaccine virus may spread and revert to virulence  <cit> . the commercially available inactivated vaccines are generally safe to use, but do not provide sufficient protection  <cit> . in addition, the ability of prrsv to subvert the host immune system further complicates these matters. at present, it is generally accepted that there is a need for new and safe vaccines that can protect against infection with those virus variants that escape immunity induced by the currently available commercial vaccines. in this context, the use of vaccine virus that is homologous to the prrsv variants prevalent in the herd seems to be favourable  <cit> . vanhee et al.  demonstrated that, by use of a controlled inactivation procedure and a suitable adjuvant, an lv-based inactivated prrsv vaccine can be developed that systematically induces an lv-specific virus-neutralizing  antibody response upon  <dig> vaccinations in naïve piglets. following homologous challenge of the vaccinated pigs with lv, animals developed an earlier and strongly elevated vn antibody response and a significant reduction of viremia was observed  <cit> . currently however, it is unknown whether it is possible to achieve similar results for prrsv isolates that are currently causing reproductive or respiratory disorders in the field. two recent prrsv isolates, from outbreaks in herds vaccinated with a registered vaccine, were used for autogenous inactivated vaccine development. the main objective of this study was to test the capacity of experimental inactivated autogenous prrsv vaccines to protect naïve pigs against homologous prrsv challenge and to compare the efficacy of these vaccines with that of experimental heterologous inactivated vaccines, the commercial vaccine used on the farms, and other commercial inactivated and attenuated vaccines.

RESULTS
vaccination experiment with prrsv isolate  <dig> v063
clinical examination
all animals remained in good health after they were vaccinated. no local or systemic vaccine side effects were noted throughout the trial period. no pigs died during the entire experimental period. body temperatures fluctuated in all groups and statistically significant differences were not detected. challenge with prrsv isolate  <dig> v <dig> induced moderate fever  within  <dig> days post infection in  <dig> out of  <dig> inoculated pigs. the  <dig> remaining animals did not develop fever. by  <dig> days post challenge, fever had disappeared in all animals.

viremia
upon challenge, all animals became viremic. in the adjuvant control group , viremia was detected from day  <dig> after the challenge  and peaked around  <dig> days post challenge , with a mean virus titer of  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml. viremia had cleared in all animals by  <dig> weeks post challenge . in the binary ethyleneimine  inactivated  <dig> v <dig> group , all animals became viremic, but the peak viremia occurred earlier  and was lower . from  <dig> dpc, virus was no longer detected in the serum of any of the animals, but one animal was again viremic at day  <dig> post challenge . the mean viral titer in the serum was significantly reduced compared to the control group at days  <dig> and  <dig> . in group  <dig> v063i, a significantly lower number of viremic piglets was observed compared to group con on days  <dig> and  <dig> post challenge . in the bei-inactivated lv vaccinated group , all animals became viremic after challenge, with a peak viremia of  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml on day  <dig>  four weeks post challenge, virus was not found anymore in the serum of any of the  <dig> pigs . the virus titers were not significantly lower than those of group con. in the group vaccinated with progressis® , viremia was detected in all animals, with a peak of  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml around 10– <dig> dpc. the viremic phase showed a similar pattern as in group con and virus titers were not significantly reduced. viremia disappeared in all animals by  <dig> weeks after challenge . in the group vaccinated with a single shot of porcilis® prrs  and the group vaccinated with one dose of ingelvac® prrs , a partial reduction in viremia was seen. viremia peaked at  <dig> dpc with average titers of  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml  and  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml  . no significant differences in mean virus titers were detected at any time-point between groups poratt, ingatt and con. only at  <dig> weeks after challenge, all animals of these groups were consistently virus negative. taking all data on viremia together, group  <dig> v063i was the only group that showed a significantly shortened viremia and a significant decrease in the number of viremic piglets compared to the mock-vaccinated control group.

 <dig> v063-specific antibodies
in group con, virus-specific antibodies were not detected before challenge . at  <dig> dpc, antibodies could be detected in all animals of this control group. in  <dig> animals of group  <dig> v063i, antibodies could already be detected at  <dig> weeks after the primo vaccination. the remaining animals within this group became seropositive after booster vaccination. from the first week after booster vaccination until  <dig> days after challenge, antibody titers in this group remained significantly higher than in group con  . in group lvi, virus-specific antibodies against  <dig> v <dig> were detected from  <dig> weeks after primo vaccination and all animals seroconverted after booster vaccination. virus-specific antibody titers were significantly higher in group lvi compared to group con from  <dig> days post booster vaccination until  <dig> dpc and at  <dig> dpc  . in group proi, one animal became seropositive at  <dig> week after booster vaccination, while the remaining animals did not show antibodies before challenge . post challenge, the course of the antibody response of this group was similar as in group con. in group poratt, virus-specific antibodies were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> pigs at  <dig> weeks after vaccination . at  <dig> weeks post vaccination, all animals were seropositive. virus-specific antibodies remained present during the entire experiment, and the antibody titers were significantly higher compared to group con from  <dig> days post vaccination until  <dig> dpc . in group ingatt, virus-specific antibodies were found in  <dig> out of  <dig> pigs at  <dig> weeks after vaccination . one week later, all pigs had seroconverted and remained seropositive until the end of the experiment. antibody titers were significantly higher compared to group con from  <dig> days post vaccination till  <dig> dpc. taken together, the courses of the ipma antibody titers in all groups were similar to those described in other studies  <cit> . 

 <dig> v063-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies
in group con, vn antibodies were not detected until  <dig> weeks post challenge. even at  <dig> weeks post challenge, not all the animals from this group were positive for vn antibodies . in group  <dig> v063i,  <dig> v063-specific vn antibodies were already detected upon booster vaccination. the mean vn antibody titer decreased immediately post challenge, but increased again  <dig> days after infection. some animals had no or undetectable vn antibodies in the period between  <dig> weeks before and  <dig> dpc, but after this period, vn antibodies were detected in all animals. the mean vn antibody titer was significantly higher compared to group con in the period between  <dig> week after booster vaccination and  <dig> weeks post challenge, reaching mean values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig>  . a similar pattern was observed in group lvi:  <dig> v063-neutralizing antibodies were already detected at  <dig> week after booster vaccination. vn antibody titers initially decreased post challenge and increased again from  <dig> dpc. some animals turned negative for vn antibodies in the period between  <dig> week before and  <dig> days after the challenge, but after this period, vn antibodies were detected in all  <dig> animals. remarkably, one animal in this group did not show neutralizing antibodies earlier than  <dig> weeks post challenge. the vn antibody titers were significantly higher compared to the control group at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after booster vaccination and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, reaching mean values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig>  respectively  . pigs that were vaccinated with progressis® , porcilis® prrs  and ingelvac® prrs  showed a roughly similar vn antibody response as the animals in the control group. in the porcilis® vaccinated group, a slight increase of vn antibodies was noticed at  <dig> weeks post challenge, but there were no significant differences with group con . in summary, both bei-inactivated vaccines induced a strong  <dig> v063-specific vn antibody response after booster vaccination, while the commercial vaccines, both inactivated and attenuated , did not induce a vn antibody response against  <dig> v <dig> 

vaccination experiment with prrsv isolate  <dig> v194
clinical examination
all animals remained in good health after they were vaccinated. no local or systemic vaccine side effects were noted throughout the trial period. one pig of group poratt <dig> died at day  <dig> at the moment of blood collection. the daily rectal temperatures varied in all groups and no statistically significant differences were observed. challenge with prrsv isolate  <dig> v <dig> induced moderate fever  within  <dig> days post infection in  <dig> out of  <dig> inoculated pigs. the  <dig> remaining animals did not develop fever. by  <dig> days post challenge, fever had disappeared in all animals.

viremia
upon challenge, all animals became viremic. in the control group , a maximum mean virus titer of  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml was reached at  <dig> dpc. subsequently, a decline in virus titer was observed and virus was no longer detectable in the serum at  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> weeks after challenge, depending on the animal. still,  <dig> piglet remained virus positive till  <dig> weeks post challenge . in the bei-inactivated  <dig> v <dig> vaccinated group , the viremic peak at day  <dig> was not reduced compared to group con <dig>  but the mean virus titer at day  <dig> was significantly reduced  and from  <dig> dpc, virus could no longer be detected in any of the piglets . the number of viremic piglets in group  <dig> v194i was significantly lower compared to group con <dig> on day  <dig> and  <dig> post challenge . mean virus titers in the group vaccinated with bei-inactivated lv virus  were comparable to those in group con <dig>  reaching  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml at  <dig> dpc, and no significant differences could be detected at any time-point between group lvi <dig> and group con <dig>  for  <dig> animals of this group, virus was cleared from the blood at  <dig> weeks, for  <dig> others at  <dig> weeks and in the remaining animal at  <dig> weeks post challenge . in the bei-inactivated  <dig> v <dig> vaccinated group , viremia was detected in all animals, with a peak around 5– <dig> dpc. the viremic phase showed a similar pattern as for group lvi <dig> and viremia was also not significantly reduced compared to group con <dig>  viremia disappeared in all animals by  <dig> weeks after challenge . the mean virus titer in the group vaccinated with porcilis® prrs  reached  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml at  <dig> days and  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml at  <dig> dpc, but virus titers were not significantly different from those in group con <dig> at these time points. at later time points however, virus titers were significantly reduced compared to group con <dig> . moreover, viremia in group poratt <dig> was already cleared at  <dig> dpc for  <dig> animals and at  <dig> dpc, all animals were negative . from  <dig> till  <dig> dpc, the total number of viremic animals in group poratt <dig> was significantly lower than in group con <dig> . in summary, groups  <dig> v194i and poratt <dig> showed a significantly shortened viremia and a significant decrease in the number of viremic piglets compared to the mock-vaccinated control group, while no such effect was seen in groups lvi <dig> and  <dig> v063i <dig> 

 <dig> v194-specific antibodies
all con <dig> animals had virus-specific serum antibodies starting from  <dig> dpc . all  <dig> animals of group  <dig> v194i seroconverted at  <dig> or  <dig> weeks after the first vaccination. similarly, all animals of group lvi <dig> showed virus-specific antibodies  <dig> weeks after the first vaccination. in group  <dig> v063i <dig>   <dig> v194-specific antibodies were detected from  <dig> weeks after primo vaccination and all animals seroconverted after booster vaccination. antibody titers in all  <dig> vaccinated groups were significantly higher compared to group con <dig> from  <dig> week after booster vaccination up till  <dig> dpc  . after  <dig> dpc, mean antibody titers in groups  <dig> v194i, lvi <dig> and  <dig> v063i <dig> remained higher compared to the control group, although differences were not significant. in group poratt <dig>  all pigs showed positive antibody titers at  <dig> weeks after vaccination; the antibody titers were significantly higher compared to group con <dig> starting from  <dig> weeks after vaccination up till  <dig> weeks post challenge  . in summary, the course of the ipma antibody titers in all groups were similar to those described in previous studies and the former experiment in this study  <cit> . 

 <dig> v194-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies
starting from  <dig> dpc,  <dig> pigs of group con <dig> showed a vn antibody titer and by  <dig> dpc, vn antibodies had appeared in all mock-vaccinated pigs . all six pigs of group  <dig> v194i showed high vn antibody titers at  <dig> week after the booster vaccination and this remained so until the end of the experiment . vn antibody titers were significantly higher in group  <dig> v194i compared to group con <dig> from  <dig> week after booster vaccination until  <dig> weeks post challenge, with mean values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig> . all animals of group lvi <dig> seroconverted for vn antibodies at least once within  <dig> weeks after booster vaccination, but vn antibody titers remained low and were only significantly higher than group con <dig> at  <dig> dpc, reaching a mean value of  <dig>  log <dig>  . a similar pattern as in group  <dig> v194i was observed in group  <dig> v063i <dig>  where  <dig> v194-neutralizing antibodies could already be detected at  <dig> week after booster vaccination. two animals turned negative for vn antibodies in the period between  <dig> weeks post booster vaccination and  <dig> dpc, but after this period, vn antibodies were consistently detected in all  <dig> animals. the mean vn antibody titer in group  <dig> v063i <dig> was significantly higher compared to group con <dig> in the period between  <dig> week after booster vaccination and  <dig> weeks post challenge , reaching mean values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig>  . none of the animals in group poratt <dig> showed  <dig> v194-specific vn antibodies before challenge, but vn antibodies already appeared between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc. the mean vn antibody titer in group poratt <dig> was slightly but not significantly higher compared to group con <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, reaching a maximum of  <dig>  log <dig> at  <dig> dpc . in summary, both bei-inactivated  <dig> v <dig>  and  <dig> v <dig>  vaccines induced a strong  <dig> v194-specific vn antibody response upon booster vaccination, while this was not the case for the heterologous bei-inactivated lv vaccine and the commercial attenuated vaccine.

discussion
prrsv causes severe reproductive disorders in sows and boars and is associated with the porcine respiratory disease complex. the virus is difficult to control and has become endemic in many major swine-producing countries, leading to tremendous economic losses worldwide  <cit> . to control the disease, several commercial attenuated and inactivated vaccines are currently available. however, when used in the field, these vaccines have met with variable degrees of success. reported outbreaks of clinical prrs in vaccinated pigs have led to doubts about the efficacy of currently available vaccines  <cit> . new vaccination strategies are needed to achieve the goals of local and regional elimination of prrsv and it is generally accepted that a continuous update of vaccine strains is necessary to reach an acceptable level of protection in the field, even within geographical areas of limited size. a recent study by vanhee et al.   <cit>  showed that a prrsv lv-based bei-inactivated vaccine induces lv-specific vn antibodies in prrsv-negative animals and offers partial protection upon homologous challenge. in that study, it was however not assessed if such a vaccine can be adapted to field variants of prrsv that are genetically and antigenically divergent from the currently used vaccine strains. the main objective of the current study was to assess the efficacy of experimental bei-inactivated vaccines, based on recent prrsv field isolates , against homologous and heterologous challenge. a commercial inactivated  and two commercial attenuated  prrsv vaccines were included in the study and served as a reference. vaccine efficacy was assessed by evaluating the viremia upon challenge – a factor directly linked with viral pathogenesis and spread.

the  <dig> v063- and  <dig> v194-based inactivated prrsv vaccines were effective in partially protecting naïve pigs upon homologous challenge. they shortened viremia with  <dig>  and  <dig>  weeks compared to the viremic phase in the respective mock-vaccinated groups, which lasted roughly  <dig> month. bei-inactivated lv vaccines were included to assess the impact of strain variability on vaccine efficacy. we found no reduction in  <dig> v <dig> viremia after the use of an inactivated lv-based vaccine and only a non-significant reduction of viremia upon challenge with  <dig> v <dig>  similarly, a  <dig> v063-based bei-inactivated prrsv vaccine did not significantly reduce viremia upon challenge with the  <dig> v <dig> isolate. the progressis® vaccine did not provide any virological protection, since viremia was observed for  <dig> weeks upon challenge with the  <dig> v <dig> isolate. this is in line with the results from previous studies, showing that the commercial inactivated vaccines appear not to influence viremia, even in nearly homologous conditions  <cit> . vaccination with the eu-genotype attenuated vaccine reduced the duration of viremia upon challenge with  <dig> v <dig> with approximately one week. in animals challenged with  <dig> v <dig>  this vaccine shortened viremia from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks. the na-genotype attenuated vaccine reduced viremia in  <dig> v063-challenged animals with approximately one week. hence, despite the concerns regarding the efficacy of the attenuated vaccine used on both farms, the results of our study indicate that the use of this vaccine in prrs-naïve pigs can clearly limit viremia. these results are in line with earlier studies published by cano et al.   <cit>  and scortti et al.   <cit> , showing that attenuated vaccines can be successful in controlling and reducing clinical disease upon homologous and heterologous challenge.

in the field, prrsv vaccination is mainly performed in sows. therefore, we reasoned it would also be interesting to assess the antibody response induced by the vaccines, since maternal antibodies play a pivotal role in the passive  immunity that protects piglets during their first weeks of life  <cit> . although resolution of prrsv infection is not always directly correlated with the neutralizing antibody response  <cit> , there is ample evidence that neutralizing antibodies can facilitate virus clearance and, when present in sufficient amounts, may even provide a sterilizing immunity  <cit> . ipma and sn tests were performed to evaluate the capacity of the vaccines to induce or prime a challenge virus-specific  antibody response.

vaccination with bei-inactivated  <dig> v <dig> or  <dig> v <dig> vaccines consistently induced sizable titers of homologous prrsv-neutralizing antibodies after at least two immunizations given four weeks apart. interestingly, vaccination with bei-inactivated lv also induced sizeable titers of  <dig> v063-neutralizing antibodies. similarly, both  <dig> v063- and lv-based vaccines induced  <dig> v194-neutralizing antibodies, with the lv-induced titers being lower than the  <dig> v063-induced titers. in all groups vaccinated with a bei-inactivated vaccine, the vn titers dropped immediately after challenge, which may indicate that the antibodies were consumed during their interaction with virus early in infection. however, after this initial drop in vn antibody titers, vn antibodies quickly reappeared. the fast appearance of vn antibodies upon challenge is in agreement with the findings in the study of vanhee et al.   <cit>  and demonstrates the potential of priming the neutralizing antibody response by immunization with a high dose of inactivated prrsv. although it has been reported that the prrsv-specific neutralizing antibody response is to a large extent strain-specific and a lack in cross-neutralization may occur even between genetically closely related virus strains  <cit> , our data show that cross-neutralization between genetically different isolates can occur. in the animals vaccinated with the commercial inactivated prrsv vaccine progressis® , neither the ipma nor the vn antibody response was influenced before or after challenge with  <dig> v <dig>  this is in line with the studies by zuckermann et al.   <cit>  and vanhee et al.   <cit> , where they used the same vaccine and the lv strain as challenge virus: no clear induction of challenge virus-specific  antibodies was observed upon vaccination with the commercial inactivated prrsv vaccine and only a moderate anamnestic antibody response was observed upon challenge of the vaccinated animals. the apparent limited immunogenicity of this vaccine may relate to the inactivation procedure used, strain variability, antigenic dose, adjuvant, … further research is necessary to elucidate this. in the animals vaccinated with the commercial attenuated vaccines, either based on eu-  or na-  type virus, a low or non-detectable vn antibody response was observed, which is in agreement with the results of lopez et al.   <cit> . none of the attenuated vaccines were able to induce a faster neutralizing antibody response upon challenge. the data obtained in this study have provided the basis for an ongoing field study on the effect of different vaccines at the farm level, more specifically on the effects of vaccination of sows on the passive immunity transferred to piglets.

in the  <dig> v063- and  <dig> v194-challenged groups vaccinated with a bei-inactivated vaccine homologous to the challenge virus, a correlation was seen between the induction of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and reduction in viremia, indicating that vn antibodies may contribute to protection against the virus. however, the induction of homologous vn antibodies was not sufficient to completely protect the animals, as it still permitted the development of a viremia post-challenge that lasted at least one week. possibly, higher vn antibody titers are needed at the time of challenge to offer full protection against the high dose of virus used to infect the animals. administration of a heterologous bei-inactivated vaccine was not sufficient to significantly reduce viremia in the animals upon challenge. since the bei-inactivated vaccines used in this study induced antibodies that could neutralize the homologous as well as the heterologous challenge virus in in vitro seroneutralization assays, it was somewhat surprising that these vaccines could only limit viremia under the homologous challenge conditions, and not when the heterologous challenge virus was used. the exact reason behind this remains currently unknown, but several possible explanations suggest themselves. for instance, it is possible that induction of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies is not sufficient and that bei-inactivated prrsv vaccines must promote other immune mechanisms  to provide a significant degree of protection upon challenge. on the other hand, it can be speculated that, although the vaccine-induced antibodies can bind and neutralize the homologous and heterologous challenge virus to a similar extent in in vitro sn assays, they recognize the homologous virus with a higher affinity. affinity differences may explain a reduced binding and neutralization of heterologous virus in vivo, as the binding conditions for  antibodies are likely more stringent in vivo than in the in vitro sn assays. under homologous challenge conditions, the antibodies have undergone optimal challenge virus-specific affinity maturation, while this is not the case under heterologous challenge conditions. in theory, the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies that cross-react with a heterologous challenge virus may even prevent the selection of high-affinity  antibodies against this challenge virus . clearly, this matter requires further investigation in the future. despite the absence of a clear challenge virus-specific vn antibody response, the commercial attenuated vaccines do provide a partial virological protection, roughly similar to the protection provided by the autogenous bei-inactivated vaccines. this observation points towards a significant role of other attenuated vaccine-induced immune mechanisms  in the protection against prrsv infection  <cit> . vaccination with the commercial inactivated vaccine progressis® did not induce vn antibodies and neither did it provide any degree of protection upon challenge.

considering the similar efficacy of the attenuated vaccines against both challenge isolates used in this study, it can be questioned whether the use of autogenous inactivated vaccines is advantageous over the use of the current attenuated vaccines. however, while the efficacy of the attenuated vaccines against new virus variants can be unpredictable, our data demonstrate that an  autogenous bei-inactivated vaccine can provide a more or less standardized, predictable degree of protection against a specific virus variant, which may prove useful in case virus variants emerge that escape the immunity induced by the attenuated vaccines. in the near future, additional research will be conducted to further substantiate this. also, although the production of autogenous inactivated vaccines as described in this study may appear too elaborate and costly , further optimization of the production process should make future use of these vaccines more feasible.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study assessed the protective capacity of different experimental and commercial vaccines against challenge with two recent prrsv field isolates. experimental bei-inactivated vaccines based on these field isolates significantly shortened viremia upon homologous challenge. despite the concerns regarding the efficacy of the commercial attenuated vaccines used on the farms where the field isolates were obtained, use of commercial attenuated vaccines resulted in a similar reduction of the viremic phase. in contrast, the experimental bei-inactivated vaccines did not significantly reduce viremia upon heterologous challenge and the commercial inactivated vaccine had no apparent effect.

while the bei-inactivated vaccines  induced challenge virus-specific neutralizing antibodies, this was not the case for the commercial inactivated and attenuated vaccines. the results illustrate that the capacity of a vaccine to induce challenge virus-specific neutralizing antibodies does not necessarily correlate with protection against the challenge virus and vice versa, suggesting that not only vaccine-induced antibodies, but also other vaccine-induced immune mechanisms can contribute to prrsv-specific protective immunity.

the observation that homologous bei-inactivated vaccines can provide a more or less standardized, predictable degree of protection against a specific virus variant suggests that such vaccines may prove useful in case virus variants emerge that escape the immunity induced by the attenuated vaccines. future research will allow optimization and simplification of the production process of the adaptable bei-inactivated vaccines and give further insights into the mechanisms of protection induced by these vaccines.
