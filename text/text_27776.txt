BACKGROUND
genetic markers have long been used to discriminate between populations and define evolutionary significant units  <cit>  or management units  <cit> , including for marine or euryhaline species for which barriers to migration are rarely easy to identify  <cit> . the choice of marker employed is critical as it has a strong influence on the ability to identify discrete populations. markers with low mutation rates could prevent or reduce the probability of detecting population differentiation, even in truly non-panmictic populations  <cit> . nearly three decades ago, avise & ellis  <cit>  advocated using mitochondrial dna  genes as preferential markers in phylogeographic genetic studies. mitochondrial genes have since proved to be useful markers to infer species or population boundaries, and have become a standard tool in conservation biology  <cit> .

progeny generally inherit their mtdna from the female parent. as such, the analysis of mtdna reflects matriarchal lineage processes only, providing information unobtainable from any nuclear marker  <cit> . this is particularly important in groups such as elasmobranchs , where there is accumulating evidence of reproductive philopatry in females but not in males  <cit> .

mitochondrial dna markers have been widely used in studies of teleost and elasmobranch fish populations over the past decade with much attention focused on the d-loop or control region . this region has been shown to be extremely variable in many vertebrates including humans  <cit> , teleosts  <cit>  and birds  <cit> . in elasmobranchs however, evolutionary rates of mitochondrial genes are low compared to other vertebrates  <cit> , and variation between distinct populations can sometimes be hard to detect with commonly used cr sequencing approaches  <cit> . however, a thorough examination of intraspecific rates of evolution of the different mtdna regions in sharks and rays has not yet been carried out, and there may be alternative regions exhibiting useful polymorphisms that could be exploited for population genetic analysis. interestingly, the highest single gene mitochondrial nucleotide diversity reported in any elasmobranch species so far was in the dark shyshark haploblepharus pictus using the coxi gene  <cit>  followed by the discus ray paratrygon aiereba using the nd <dig> gene  <cit> . also, naylor et al.  <cit>  collected  <dig>  nd <dig> sequences and looked at intraspecific divergences in  <dig> different elasmobranch species. many were found to show substantial differences among populations. in order to increase the ability to detect population structure, a few studies have included the analysis of more than one mtdna marker with variable success  <cit> . one study included a preliminary screening of four different regions to find the most variable one, which happened to be the nd <dig> gene followed by the atp gene and then the cr  <cit> . these results suggest that in elasmobranchs the cr could be under higher evolutionary constraints  than in other vertebrates.

recent advances in next generation sequencing have significantly reduced costs in a way that could easily facilitate routine investigation of intraspecific variation of whole elasmobranch mtdna genomes at typical sampling levels used for standard population analyses. in the past, whole mitogenome sequencing has only been used in phylogenetic studies, where the number of individuals sequenced was generally low. compared to single gene approaches, whole mitogenome sequencing can sometimes provide higher resolution of phylogenies and increased precision of divergence time estimates  <cit> . more recently, whole mitogenome sequencing has been used to investigate diversity at the intra-species level. for example, it provided improved resolution of population structure in the green turtle chelonia mydas  <cit>  and the north american fisher martes pennanti   <cit> . it has also been used in species delineation  <cit>  and the detection of genes under selection in the killer whale orcinus orca  <cit> . there are currently no publications using this method in elasmobranchs.

the speartooth shark glyphis glyphis is a rare, habitat- and range-restricted, river shark of northern australia and southern papua new guinea  <cit> . it is confirmed from only eight rivers of northern australia, with the majority of records coming from van diemen gulf drainages  in the northern territory, and the wenlock river, western cape york peninsula, queensland. there is an apparent large gap  in its distribution between the van diemen gulf drainages and the wenlock river  <cit> . its rarity, limited range, and the suspected impacts of fishing activities resulted in a listing of critically endangered on the australian environment protection and biodiversity conservation act  <dig>  little is known of its biology: juveniles and sub-adults have been recorded across a large salinity range in rivers, however, adults of this species have never been recorded and their range and habitat requirements are unknown  <cit> . an understanding of population structure is required to inform management and conservation measures for this species. wynen et al.  <cit>  developed a dna barcoding approach for confirming species delineation using portions of the cox <dig> gene and the cr. this approach proved to be successful in distinguishing between g. glyphis and the sympatric northern river shark g. garricki and bull shark carcharhinus leucas, but no intraspecific variation was found across  <dig> and 17 g. glyphis individuals from the northern territory and queensland, respectively, thus preventing any assessment of potential population structure.

the aim of this study was to explore the potential of whole mitogenome sequencing for phylogeographic studies in elasmobranchs, using g. glyphis as a case study. we anticipated that this approach would provide useful information for the conservation of this critically endangered species, as well as giving insights into the intraspecific genetic variability of the different mitogenomic regions in elasmobranchs.

RESULTS
data reliability
the complete mitogenomes of 93 g. glyphis were successfully sequenced and assembled . individual mean coverage ranged from  <dig> to over  <dig>  fold ensuring a high quality of mitogenome sequencing. the duplicated sequencing of the g. glyphis reference mitogenome  <cit>  provided the exact same sequence twice, demonstrating a high degree of reliability in the dataset.

less than  <dig> % of the reads from g. glyphis samples were successfully mapped on the largetooth sawfish pristis pristis mitogenome, the other elasmobranch species present in the miseq run. those reads were mostly mapped on the highly conserved 16s region, thus suggesting cross contamination did not occur during library preparation.

mitogenomic diversity
twelve haplotypes were observed among the  <dig> fish from the three river drainages sampled . no insertions or deletions were observed, and the g. glyphis mitogenome was calculated to be  <dig>  bp in length. interestingly, no transversions were observed but there were  <dig> transitions spread across  <dig> haplotypes. nucleotide diversity  was  <dig>  and haplotype diversity   <dig> . only one amino acid change was found in the complete dataset, at position  <dig> of the nd <dig> alignment; this was not river drainage specific. the highest genetic diversity was found in the alligator rivers , whereas the wenlock river exhibited the lowest genetic diversity . river drainages each contained from one to four drainage-specific haplotypes . genetic diversity indices for each of the drainage locations derived from the whole genome dataset are given in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

the ‘all proteins’ sub-dataset recovered  <dig> out of the  <dig> variable sites. among the single gene sub-datasets, nd <dig> was the most diverse with  <dig> variable sites and a nucleotide diversity of  <dig> , followed by nd <dig> with  <dig> variable sites and a nucleotide diversity of  <dig> . the 12s region harbored  <dig> variable sites for a nucleotide diversity of  <dig> . several sub-datasets, including 16s, cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  atp <dig> and atp <dig> did not exhibit any variation. additional file 1: table s <dig> summarizes the variable site positions per mitogenome region and per haplotype.

with the exception of tajima’s d in the adelaide river, neutrality tests calculated from the whole mitogenome were not significant . neutrality tests calculated from single region sub-dataset were generally concordant with this result. a complete set of genetic diversity indices for the whole mitogenome and all sub-datasets is available in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

population structure
significant genetic structure was detected among the three river drainages . the pairwise differentiation Φst values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and all were significant . the genetic differentiation inferred from each sub-dataset varied greatly . apart from the ‘all proteins’ sub-dataset, only two single region sub-datasets, 12s and nd <dig>  recovered significant Φst values for all population pairs. nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd4l suggested the existence of barriers to gene flow between the adelaide river and the alligator rivers, and between the alligator rivers and the wenlock river, but not between the adelaide river and the wenlock river. no signs of genetic differentiation were found in cytb and cr, the remaining sub-datasets that exhibited some degree of genetic variation. interestingly, overall values of Φst appeared concordant with geographical distances among the three populations, with adelaide-alligators  having lower values than the alligators-wenlock and adelaide-wenlock .table  <dig>

discussion
the whole mitogenomic survey using next generation sequencing  proved to be an efficient and accurate method for routine surveys of g. glyphis population structure in australia. all mitogenomic sequences were easily amplified by pcr and sequenced with a high degree of reliability in a time-efficient manner. the data collection pipeline, from pcr amplification to the mitogenome alignment ready for analysis, could be completed in one week if all individuals are sequenced on the same miseq run. despite some discrepancies in coverage across samples, the high read coverage provided by the miseq ensured sufficient coverage for each individual. additionally, the attempt to map reads from g. glyphis barcodes on the p. pristis reference mitogenome demonstrated that cross contamination of sequence data was not significant. following the method described here, whole mitogenome sequencing is currently 4- <dig> fold more expensive than single fragment analysis by sanger sequencing. however, this method could be optimized in several ways to make the best use of the high number of reads offered by high throughput sequencers, including  pooling more libraries on a given sequencing run  <cit> ; or  pooling several species in each library  <cit> . whole mitogenome sequencing costs will also continue to fall as technology improves.

mitogenomic sequencing in g. glyphis revealed particularly low levels of genetic diversity. previous to this study, the species that exhibited the lowest recorded genetic diversity inferred from a whole mitogenome was the giant squid, architeuthis sp., in a survey of  <dig> individuals from  <dig> sampling locations  <cit> . this species harbored a nucleotide diversity of  <dig> , more than three times higher than that of g. glyphis. the low diversity in the giant squid is believed to be due to a recent bottleneck followed by expansion, possibly coupled with a low mutation rate  <cit> . with the exception of the adelaide river, there were no signs of recent population expansion in g. glyphis, suggesting that a bottleneck followed by population expansion is unlikely to be the best explanation for this species.

a low mutation rate, however, could partly explain such low diversity: rates of mitochondrial dna evolution in elasmobranchs are slow compared to other taxa  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, there is no other study investigating the intraspecific variability of whole mitogenomic sequences in elasmobranchs to compare with our data. however, our review of the current literature examining single gene analysis of mitochondrial diversity in sharks and rays  indicates that slow mutation rate alone cannot completely explain the low nucleotide diversity found in g. glyphis. all species included in this review had populations with higher nucleotide diversity indices;  <dig> out of  <dig> species exhibited nucleotide diversity indices at least one order of magnitude higher than g. glyphis . some shark species however, exhibited populations without any or only very low levels of nucleotide diversity for the gene under study. again, a recent bottleneck event was proposed to explain the low genetic diversity observed in the basking shark cetorhinus maximus  <cit>  and the nurse shark ginglymostoma cirratum  <cit> , two coastal species with large ranges. in the grey nurse shark carcharias taurus, demographic events in the deep history of the species  and especially low levels of molecular evolution were proposed to explain current levels of genetic diversity  <cit> . in addition to past demographic events, current effective population size can also affect levels of nucleotide diversity  <cit> . glyphis glyphis has a naturally very limited range, being recorded in only a small number of tidal rivers and their estuaries in northern australia and southern papua new guinea resulting in a low expected total number of individuals for this species  <cit> . we thus argue that the low genetic diversity observed in g. glyphis is probably due to the low evolutionary rate of mitochondrial genes  combined with an extremely small population size leading to subsequent loss of diversity through genetic drift  <cit> . these factors also apply in g. garricki, which shares with g. glyphis its limited habitat, limited range and probably small localized populations. this could explain the absence of genetic variation in the cr of  <dig> g. garricki analysed by wynen et al.  <cit> . low levels of genetic diversity were also observed in c. leucas in northern australia, another species sharing juvenile life cycle and habitat characteristics with g. glyphis  <cit> .

despite very low observed genetic diversity among river drainages, our whole mitogenome sequencing approach was able to detect sufficient variation to provide the first insight into the population structure of g. glyphis. haplotype diversity appears to be partitioned in a way that suggests strong female philopatry as each of the three river drainages is home to a distinct genetic population. prior to our study, no evidence of population structure had been observed, however this was inferred from single gene approaches  <cit> . our result is critical for the implementation of conservation measures to manage and ultimately recover this critically endangered species. tissue samples of g. glyphis used in this study were obtained from juvenile and sub-adult animals captured in the adelaide, alligators and wenlock river drainages. in australia, this represents the entire known extant distribution of g. glyphis with the population in the bizant river, eastern cape york peninsula presumed extinct  <cit> . given the population structuring and low levels of female dispersal highlighted in this study, remaining population centers need to be managed as discrete population units. the life history of g. glyphis is not fully understood, although given the apparent absence of adults from river systems, adults presumably occur in marine habitats  <cit> . the presence of a boundary to gene flow in females indicates that females return to the river of their birth to undertake parturition, but whether adult populations are also segregated remains unknown. as mtdna strictly reflects female-mediated gene flow, further investigation of nuclear markers is warranted to evaluate patterns of male-mediated gene flow among these populations. in c. leucas, population structuring occurred only at very large scales and not between adjacent rivers  <cit> . glyphis glyphis either has more discrete reproductive habitat preferences than c. leucas  or the two gene approach used by tillett et al.  <cit>  did not have the power to detect structure at a finer scale, as would have been the case in g. glyphis using a similar approach .

the analysis of each sub-section of the mitogenome further highlighted the advantage of whole mitogenome sequencing compared to single gene approaches. several commonly used mitogenome regions, including cr and cox <dig> were invariant and hence failed to detect any barrier to gene flow between the three river drainages under study. these results were consistent with previous work on g. glyphis by wynen et al.  <cit> . in the current study, nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd4l genes all provided partial insights into the population structuring of g. glyphis. a similar finding was made in chelonia mydas, where whole mitogenomic sequences improved the population structure resolution compared to single gene analysis  <cit> . interestingly, the strongest barrier to gene flow inferred from the whole mitogenome dataset , was the most difficult to identify with single region datasets. this is because the haplotypes harbored by sharks from the wenlock river differ from the most common haplotype by  <dig> or  <dig> mutations only. the uniqueness of those haplotypes relies on a very low number of mutations , clearly demonstrating the difference that can be made by sequencing the whole mitogenome compared to a subset of the mitogenome only. not sequencing the mitogenome sections containing those critical mutations would have missed this population structure pattern. this has particularly important ramifications for species with low mutation rates such as elasmobranchs or in cases where isolation between populations has only occurred recently  <cit> .

in g. glyphis, 12s and nd <dig> were the most variable mitochondrial regions and the only ones providing comparable resolution to that of the whole mitogenome to detect barriers to gene flow between each river drainage pair. this result challenges the assumptions commonly made over the past decade on which marker should be used in elasmobranch phylogeographic studies. our literature review revealed that the cr was the most commonly chosen marker with nd <dig> and cytb the two next most common  . in the absence of any comprehensive study investigating intraspecific rates of evolution in the different mitogenomic regions in elasmobranchs, we argue that the wide use of the cr in elasmobranchs relies mostly on an assumption that this region will be the most variable in the mitogenome, as observed in other taxa  <cit> . in fact, the few times cr has been compared to other regions, it was not found to be most variable  <cit> . we do not argue that the cr is always a poor marker for phylogeographic studies in elasmobranch species and should not be used. for example, at least five studies analyzing the cr in elasmobranch species report nucleotide diversity indices over  <dig>  thus providing a good capacity to detect population structure  <cit> . also, many other studies were successful in detecting some degree of population structure despite lower levels of nucleotide diversity in the cr . however, our study demonstrates clearly that other regions of the mitogenome should be examined as they potentially improve population resolution.

the 12s and nd <dig> regions are the two most variable markers reported here, but they have not previously been used for intra-specific phylogeographic studies in elasmobranchs. the 12s region, however, is often used to infer phylogenetic relationships between elasmobranch species  <cit>  or for species identification  <cit> . similarly, the nd <dig> gene has been rarely used in phylogeographic studies of elasmobranchs, although see  <cit>  for manta species delineation. analysis of other elasmobranch species is required to further investigate the potential of 12s and nd <dig> as a source of mitochondrial intraspecific diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study clearly demonstrates the difference that whole mitogenome sequencing can make in population genetic studies that focus on species with low genetic diversity. given the current state of technology and sequencing costs, we strongly recommend the use of whole mitogenome sequencing for future population genetic studies in elasmobranchs. intraspecific mitogenomic surveys may expose a large amount of cryptic population structure in species that have only been examined for a single mitochondrial region such as the cr. at a minimum, we suggest preliminary whole mitogenome analyses on a small number of individuals should be performed to identify the more variable mitochondrial regions when population-level sequencing is cost-prohibitive. forthcoming mitogenomic surveys might also help to identify more general patterns of variability permitting a better choice of specific mitochondrial genes containing variable regions of interest in elasmobranchs.
