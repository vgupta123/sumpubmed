BACKGROUND
the st <dig> lineage of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  is one of the most widely disseminated hospital-associated mrsas   <cit> , which has caused multiple epidemics around the world in recent decades. in china, as in most asian countries, st239-sccmeciii has been identified as the predominant clone, accounting for around 75% of observed ha-mrsa  <cit> . in hong kong, st239-sccmeciii was the most prevalent mrsa clone during the late 1980s and the 1990s  <cit> . however, although it remains one of the most common clones in hospitals in hong kong, its prevalence amongst st <dig> strains has decreased from the early 2000s  <cit> . whole-genome sequencing in clinical microbiology has revolutionized our understanding of mrsa, in areas such as outbreak investigation  <cit> , evolutionary and phylogeographic distribution and in recombination studies  <cit> . harris et al.
 <cit>  described the comparative genomics, by the reads-mapping method, of globally collected st <dig> strains using the tw <dig> genome as a reference. this research group demonstrated the global geographic distribution of the st <dig> lineage, indicating intercontinental transmission, based on core-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . the st <dig> lineage consisted of more than five mrsa clades; these reflect the various continental origins, such as north and south america, australia and europe, whereas the tw <dig>  chinese and thai isolates formed into the single ‘asian clade’  <cit> . ramirez et al. supplemented these data with further isolates, confirmed the strong geographical clustering and identified recombination rates that varied between phylogeographic sub-groups  <cit> . marked divergence was noted between the european st <dig> strains. prophages, as one form of mobile genetic element , play an important role in horizontal gene transfer and the bacterial evolution of mrsa. the φspβ-like prophage is thought to be an important characteristic of the st <dig> ‘asian clade’  <cit> , as it possesses the sasx gene, a crucial pathogenicity determinant in the spread of st <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing of four clinical isolates of mrsa that were representative of ha-mrsa st <dig> isolated in hong kong and beijing during different time periods. we investigated the genomic diversity and evolutionary origins of these four isolates, by comparing their genomes with those of three previously published st <dig> isolates and the publicly available st <dig> sequence that represents strains from different continents. in addition, orthologous gene group  analyses from annotations and whole-genome alignments of the hong kong and beijing strains were examined to highlight differences at the protein group level in the core and non-core regions that distinguish and characterize these strains geographically.

RESULTS
the phylogenetic analysis of st <dig> clones
the molecular types of the strains are summarized in table  <dig>  the relationship of the hk and bj strains, relative to other representative global st <dig> isolates, is shown in the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> core genome snps were identified among these  <dig> isolates. distinct clustering between the hk  and bj  strains was obtained. the two hk strains showed a close relationship and they were clustered within the ‘asian clade’ with tw <dig>  previously reported strains from china  and thailand , and den <dig> from denmark  <cit> . however, bj strains formed a distinct cluster with reference t <dig>  the t <dig> strain was recovered from an 87-year-old patient in tianjin, northern china in  <dig>  <cit> . this bj cluster was closely related to the strains of the ‘turkish clade’  and the 'russia variant'  . this strongly suggested that these were of different origin to the st <dig> strains in hong kong and asia. the other st <dig> strains showed consistent geographical clustering in concordance with previous studies by harris et al.

comparative genomics
the bj <dig> and bj <dig> genomes were estimated to be at least  <dig>  mb in size and the hk <dig> and hk <dig> genomes approximately  <dig>  mb . comparison with the three published complete genomes – t <dig>  tw <dig> and jkd <dig> – revealed that the two bj genomes have the highest average nucleotide similarity to t <dig> , the lowest to tw <dig>  and the reverse held for the two hk strains . these results were consistent with those of the phylogenetic tree . the two bj genome sequences and t <dig>  were compared with the two hk genomes and tw <dig>  by whole-genome alignment . the major difference between the two clusters was the presence or absence of specific mges, which also explained the difference in genome sizes. a φspβ-like  <dig>  kb  prophage was present in the hk <dig> and hk <dig> strains . in contrast, the whole φspβ-like  prophage was absent in bj <dig> and bj <dig>  instead replaced by a  <dig> bp gene encoding a hypothetical protein between the tnp and ampa genes, similar to the reference genome, t <dig>  the φspβ-like  prophage is considered to be a feature of the st <dig> ‘asian clade’ and it is therefore similarly detected in other ‘asian clade’ st <dig> strains . these strains possess the sasx gene, which is located at the 3’ end of the φspβ-like prophage and plays a key role in mrsa colonization, making it a crucial pathogenicity determinant in the spread of st <dig>  <cit> . the sasx gene was absent in the bj cluster.table  <dig>

another notable difference between the two clusters was the absence of the  <dig>  kb prophage φsa <dig> in the bj cluster. both hk genomes contained a  <dig>  kb deletion within φsa <dig> . it has previously been noted that the φsa <dig> region does not carry any known virulence factors  <cit> . both clusters possessed the  <dig>  kb prophage φsa <dig> but some differences were observed, especially in the region between the gene encoding the transcriptional activator rinb , to the 3′ end . in this region, the bj cluster contained the additional coding sequences : mvaa, φpvl hypothetical protein, metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily domain-containing protein and feob ss- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyl transferase. the proteins encoded by these cds are involved in antibiotic resistance, virulence and metabolism. blast analysis indicated that the feob ss- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyl transferase gene was only identified previously in two australian strains in the ncbi database: jkd <dig>  and jkd  <dig> . the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily domain-containing protein gene has been found in a number of different phages and mrsa clones, such as staphylococcus phages js <dig>  sp <dig> and phinm3; and mrsa clones jkd <dig> , mrsa <dig> , and  <dig> . tw <dig> also harboured a similar gene, but differed by  <dig> snps, and none of the hk strains harboured this gene. for the mvaa φpvl hypothetical protein gene, similar genes were found in jkd <dig> , jkd <dig> , mw <dig>  and mssa <dig> . all six genomes possessed other virulence-associated genes, including the phospholipase c gene, staphylococcal complement inhibitor scin, staphylokinase and enterotoxin a  <cit> .figure  <dig>

a noteworthy difference in the bj cluster, absent in the hk strains, was a  <dig>  kb region insertion in the gene encoding the 30s ribosomal protein s <dig>  rpsr . blast and phast identified that this region shows high similarity with phage pt <dig>  this pt1028-like prophage contains important functional genes, such as sasd, integrase, pola, deod <dig>  sapi <dig> and others encoding pathogenicity island proteins .figure  <dig>

the analysis also demonstrated other divergences at the mge level. for example, the pathogenicity island sapi <dig> , which contains enterotoxins k and q, was absent in all of the bj cluster strains. similar to tw <dig>  hk <dig> carried the sapi <dig> island , but it was absent in hk <dig> . an  <dig> kb insertion in t <dig> in the chromosome downstream of the rnr putative ribonuclease gene, containing an exfoliative toxin a/b gene, was not present in the hk cluster. both the bj strains contained a  <dig>  kb fragment of this  <dig> kb insertion region, but not the virulence genes .

there are also unique features of individual strains. for example, phast indicated a specific  <dig>  kb region in bj <dig>  which showed the greatest similarity with the prophage φnm <dig> . this φnm1-like prophage  harbored two of the three virulence genes, i.e., homologs of sav <dig> and sav <dig>  <cit> , but not homologs of the sav <dig> gene. the detailed structure of this φnm1-like prophage  is included in additional file  <dig> 

orthomcl analysis
with annotation information and the orthomcl algorithm, the families of orthologous gene groups were calculated by comparison with tw <dig> and t <dig>  the protein sequences of the latter reference genomes were derived from ncbi annotations. the results are illustrated in venn diagrams . the hk cluster strains shared  <dig>  common orthologous gene groups  . the bj cluster strains shared  <dig>  common oggs . bj <dig> contained more unique oggs not present in the other two genomes. figure 7c shows that  <dig>  common oggs were shared by all six genomes.figure  <dig>

forty-seven oggs were common in the bj cluster but were not present in any of the hk cluster genomes. at least  <dig> of  <dig> oggs were related to genomic islands . sixteen orthologous groups were composed of hypothetical proteins and pseudogenes, whereas four oggs consisted of genes orthologous to genes for the following representative proteins from t0131: histidine ammonia-lyase; myosin-cross-reactive streptococcal antigen homolog; methicillin-resistance-related protein fmhc; and multidrug resistance transporter b.

the details of these four oggs are shown in additional file  <dig>  genes in three of the groups  contained single nucleotide deletions, thus leading to a frameshift mutation and predicted truncation of their encoded proteins. the first group included the gene encoding histidine ammonia-lyase  and its homologs in bj <dig> and bj <dig>  the  <dig> aa huth histidine ammonia-lyase protein  is present in mrsa strains such as mrsa <dig>  jkd <dig> and tw <dig> and plays an important role in histidine metabolism. in the bj cluster strains, a ‘t’ deletion occurred at the  <dig> th bp of the huth gene , causing a frameshift mutation that truncated the huth into a 382aa length histidine ammonia-lyase protein  and a 120aa protein sat0131_ <dig>  the putative conserved lyase-i-like superfamily domain was detected in this  <dig> aa protein. further functional analysis and experimental work are needed to determine whether this has any significant impact on histidine metabolism.

a frameshift mutation  was also detected in the bj cluster strains of the  <dig> aa myosin-cross-reactive antigen  protein , the representative protein in the second ogg. it is not known what the effects of this mutation might be.

the remaining two groups were related to antimicrobial resistance. whole-genome alignment of the bj cluster revealed an ‘a’ deletion  at the 826th bp position of the mw <dig> gene . this frameshift mutation resulted in a truncated  <dig> aa protein sat0131_ <dig> and a  <dig> aa length protein sat0131_ <dig>  the  <dig> aa length fmhc protein  shares identity with fema and femb and is classified in the cell wall category  <cit> . previously, it has been reported that insertional deactivation of fmhc had no effects on growth, antibiotic susceptibility or the lysostaphin resistance of s. aureus strains  <cit>  and its function remains elusive.

in the fourth ogg, multidrug resistance protein b  shared identity with the 393aa multidrug resistance transporter protein b , which is present in newman, col, usa300_fpr <dig>  jkd <dig> and tw <dig> mrsa strains. whether specific local selective pressures by antimicrobials may have contributed to the changes described above, and how these alter antimicrobial resistance, remains to be determined.

the hk cluster genomes contained  <dig> oggs that were not present in any of the bj cluster genomes. except for  <dig> groups, which consisted of hypothetical proteins and pseudo genes, all of the other  <dig> oggs were associated with genomic islands . this may reflect the substantial impact of gis on the evolution of the ‘asian clade’ of st <dig> 

discussion
the st <dig> lineage represents a globally disseminated multi-drug-resistant ha-mrsa. the geographical clustering of strains of the st <dig> lineage has been confirmed, both at the continental and national levels  <cit> , and the diversity of european isolates has been discussed in various studies  <cit> . however, asian isolates were thought to belong to a single, large ‘asian clade’, as represented by thai and chinese isolates, although some diversity was detected within this clade  <cit> . our data revealed geographical clustering – with a diversity of st239s causing epidemics in hospitals in beijing and hong kong during the late 1990s and the 2000s – and suggested different origins of the st239s and the possibility of a more complex distribution in asia. the hk isolates clustered within the traditional ‘asian clade’ and showed a high similarity with tw <dig>  and those present in taiwan, thailand and malaysia. the distinct bj cluster is more likely to represent the local establishment of an endemic, predominant clone for a number of years, at least from  <dig> onwards. according to a recent national surveillance report of mrsa in china, st239-iii-t030s have the same molecular types and characteristics as cuhk_bj <dig>  and they remain the most predominant ha-mrsa clones in china, with an overall prevalence of  <dig> %  <cit> . the bj cluster, including the reference genome t <dig>  showed distinct features, based on their non-synonymous snps at the core genome, as well as differences at the mge level. these observations collectively indicated the possibility that the bj cluster st239-iii-t030s originated from a relatively recent common ancestor and was disseminated during this period in the st <dig> lineage. the cn <dig> strain, isolated in  <dig> and confirmed as a representative st <dig> strain in beijing  <cit> , also clustered within the bj cluster, and reaffirmed the homogeneity of this cluster. interestingly, the ‘russia variant’ 16k strain  <cit>  also showed close relationship with the bj cluster and ‘turkish clade’, further illustrating the distinct geographical spread of st <dig> in the north of china. further studies are needed, on strains retrieved from older collections and across other parts of china, to estimate the origin and widespread nature of the bj cluster of st <dig> 

the reads-mapping assembly method has inherent limitations for mge detection and non-core genome analysis; this is because mges that are absent in the reference genome are not detectable. this disadvantage cannot be overcome, even by using a large number of reference genomes. thus, in our study, we performed a de novo assembly and deep sequencing  of each strain. moreover, three reference genomes were used in the ordering of contigs and the whole-genome alignment process. recently, an st <dig> russian variant also showed an absence of the φspβ-like  prophage  <cit>  and this may suggest a potential evolutionary link. however, the unique pt1028-like prophage was not reported in the russian isolate and the relationship of these strains remains elusive.

the isolates from hong kong are representative of the prevalent st <dig> clone during the last two decades. st <dig> has been the predominant ha-mrsa clone since  <dig> and the strains were characterized as multidrug-resistant and prevalent in various hospitals in hong kong . they are closely related to tw <dig> of the ‘asian clade’ and possessed the φspβ-like prophage and were sasx-gene-positive, and they further demonstrated the epidemic wave and dissemination of sasx-positive st <dig> ha-mrsa in hong kong and southern china. the results of orthomcl analysis supported the phylogenetic tree at the protein level. the specific oggs that were present only in the hk or bj cluster strains provided further evidence that the horizontal gene transfer of gis played an important role in st <dig> family evolution and geographical clustering. comparative genomics revealed the common differences between the two clades of st <dig> ha-mrsa at snp, gene and mge levels. the availability of next generation sequencing on a wider scale will further enhance our understanding of the dynamic evolutionary process in the transmission and spread of globally disseminated multidrug-resistant mrsa.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, comparative genomics, based on de novo assembly and deep sequencing, revealed the different origins of the st <dig> lineage in northern and southern china and pointed out the common differences between the two st <dig> ha-mrsa clades at snp, gene and protein levels. besides distinct gis, which were responsible for the major differences in the two clusters, orthomcl analyses and whole-genome alignment of the hk and bj clusters highlighted differences in genes located in the core genome. single nucleotide deletions, resulting in frameshift mutations, were detected in a number of genes, with the predicted disruption of their encoded proteins, which are known to play an important role in metabolic pathways and antimicrobial resistance. these results reveal the complexity of dissemination and dynamic evolution of the st <dig> lineage in china and indicate possible transmission routes. the availability of next generation sequencing technology on a wider scale will further enhance our understanding of the dynamic evolutionary process in the transmission and spread of globally disseminated multidrug-resistant mrsa.
