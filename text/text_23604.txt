BACKGROUND
drought stress is one of the main environmental constraints that severely affects plant growth and development  <cit> . worldwide, water stress is the main cause of economic losses in agriculture and forestry. water is an increasingly scarce resource given the current and future needs of human populations and societies  <cit> , and droughts are expected to become increasingly severe due to climate change and the increasing scarcity of water. perennial plants have evolved specific physiological mechanisms to adapt to natural variation in environmental conditions, including variation in water availability  <cit> . plants under drought stress may survive by employing various protective mechanisms  <cit> . analysis of these protective mechanisms will contribute to our knowledge of drought-tolerance and drought-resistance  <cit> .

currently, molecular biologists are exploring the genetic basis of plant responses to environmental stresses, including drought, by examining the expressions of relevant genes  <cit> . drought tolerance is a complex trait that is regulated by multiple genes, interactions among genes, and environmental cues  <cit> . therefore, manipulating a single gene encoding a protein or transcription factor has proved to be insufficient to maintain productivity under drought conditions  <cit> . hence, the complex responses to environmental stress, from perception to transcriptional changes, need to be considered on a systems biology scale  <cit> . several techniques are available for such studies, including representational difference analysis , serial analysis of gene expression , suppression subtractive hybridization , cdna microarrays, oligo microarrays, and rna-seq to analyze the transcriptome and identify genes that are up- or downregulated during drought tolerance  <cit> . the cdna-aflp method is an extremely efficient and sensitive mrna fingerprinting technique to identify both common and rare transcripts  <cit> . this technique is a robust and high-throughput tool for analysis of genome-wide gene expression, and can be used for identifying genes that are differentially expressed under abiotic stress  <cit> .

poplar has become a model species for tree research since the release of the full p. trichocarpa genome  <cit> . in addition, poplars are the most rapidly growing trees at temperate latitudes, and are widely grown for pulp, paper, wood, and fuel  <cit> . poplar is more sensitive to water deficit than other tree species; however, its drought tolerance varies markedly among different populus genotypes, both inter-and intra-specifically  <cit> . many recent genome-wide studies have provided insight into the variability of the transcriptome response to water stress. street et al.  hypothesized that the control of gene expression may be an important process in species divergence  <cit> . wilkins et al.  suggested that it is difficult to capture a genome-wide drought response using only one or a few populus genotypes  <cit> . moreover, differences in the drought-responsive transcriptomes among balsam poplar genotypes are related to the extent of intra-specific dna sequence variation  <cit> . these results suggest that genetic relatedness is likely an indicator of a shared drought response  <cit> . considering the variability in drought transcriptomes of various forest trees, the use of more drought-tolerant populus genotypes used in research would help to elucidate the drought response of poplar.

populus hopeiensis, which is in the section leuce, is native to china. it is a drought- and chill-tolerant tree species that is mainly distributed in the arid and semi-arid areas of northwest and northern china . therefore it is an ideal material for the study the mechanisms of drought-tolerance of mechanisms in poplar. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the transcriptome response to water deficit, and to highlight candidate genes for future research.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of cdna clones
a total of  <dig> primer combinations  were used for the aflp analysis of cdnas from drought-stressed poplar. cdnas were obtained from poplar at four stages, i.e. 0%, 20%, 30%, and 50%, of fresh weight loss  . a total of  <dig> transcript-derived fragments  was isolated from the silver-stained cdna-aflp gels based on their presence/absence  or difference in the levels of expression . a majority of the variants was of quantitative type , whereas 14% were qualitative. sequence alignment of these  <dig> cloned tdfs against ncbi databases showed that  <dig> had a homologous gene in the database. due to incompleteness of poplar gene annotation and the conservation of gene families between poplar and arabidopsis, we used the arabidopsis matches of the identified differentially expressed genes as surrogates for function annotation. a total of  <dig> of  <dig> tdfs had no annotation in the database. three of the tdfs  had no similar sequences in the ncbi databases.

among the tdf sequences, some high-homology sequences were from the same gene, for example, tdf <dig> and tdf <dig> were from the dehydrin  gene: tdf <dig> and tdf <dig> were from the boiling stable protein  gene, tdf <dig> and tdf <dig> were from a zinc-finger protein gene: tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  and tdf <dig> were from an alpha expansin gene; and tdf <dig> and tdf <dig> were from a translation extension factor gene. tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  and tdf <dig> all represented members of the phosphatase 2 c gene family.

tdf functional classification and expression analysis
to group genes with similar expression patterns, all tdfs were analyzed using hierarchical average linkage clustering. the  <dig> tdfs formed  <dig> clusters. of these,  <dig> clusters of genes  were shown up regulated from 0% fwl to 20% fwl stage, the others down regulated. at 20% fwl to 30% fwl stage,  <dig> clusters of genes  were shown up regulated. at the last stage, only  <dig> clusters of genes  . clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> tdfs, respectively, and these two groups combined to form the largest cluster . genes in cluster  <dig> exhibited increased expression as the fresh weight decreased, peaking at the 50% fwl stage . genes in cluster  <dig> showed a peak in expression at the 20% fwl stage, which decreased expression at the 50% fwl stage. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contained tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig> and tdf <dig>  which encoded protein kinases, phosphokinases, transcription factors, heat shock protein , early-responsive to dehydration , and late embryonic proteins, respectively. the smallest cluster was cluster  <dig>  which contained only three tdfs. the other eight clusters each contained 2–9% of the remaining tdfs.

gene ontology annotation
all tdf sequences were functionally and structurally annotated using blast2go, and the main assignments are summarized in table <dig> under the three main categories of biological process, molecular function and cellular complement. concerning the biological process ontology, metabolic process , localization , cellular process  and response to stimulus  were highly enriched for water loss  <dig> % on average. the most enriched molecular function terms were binding , catalytic activity , structural molecule activity . of those, enrichments, the percentages of the binding and catalytic activity terms were increased with water loss in upregulated volume, and decreased slowly in downregulated volume. in terms of cellular component ontology, the most significantly enriched terms was intracellular , which accounted for almost one-third of all terms. similarly, membrane , nucleus  and apoplast  together comprised one third of cellular component terms. the most important go terms of enrichment are indicated in table <dig>

aliasesa were obtained from the joint genome institute ; accession nos.b were obtained from ncbi genebank ; all sequences were also searched for at tair. the details are provided in the supplementary data .

quantitative real time rt-pcr analysis
twenty-four tdfs representing genes with different expression patterns in response to water loss were subjected to quantitative real time rt-pcr . the poplar actinii-like  and ubiquitin genes, which are constitutively expressed in performed with semi-quantitative real time rt-pcr analysis were selected as the internal control to which transcript abundance was normalized . for most tdfs, transcript fold ratios were similar to the cdna-aflp results, indicating the reliability of that technique . tdf <dig> and tdf <dig> displayed a higher fold-induction in the pcr analysis, which probably reflects the higher dynamic range of qpcr  <cit> . meanwhile, these two tdfs were used to detect expression patterns in response to other stresses . only the expression pattern of tdf <dig> differed between the qpcr and cdna-aflp data. the expression of nine tdfs coding unknown proteins from different clusters was determined using real-time pcr .

expressions of antioxidant and photosynthetic genes under drought stress
we examined the expression patterns of genes associated with oxidative stress, which is related to the drought-stress response, and classified them into three types; type i genes showed increased expression from 0% to 20% fwl, then a rapid decrease in expression from 20% to 30% fwl. in the last stage , most tdfs showed stable levels of expression, except for tdf <dig>  which showed a slight increase . annotation analyses showed that most of type i genes were associated with cell membranes. type ii genes showed stable expression in the first and last stages of dehydration, but a significant increase in 30% fwl stage . most of these genes were associated with the mitochondria. type iii genes showed increased expression throughout the drought treatment . go analyses showed that most of these genes were associated with the mitochondria and the peroxisomes.

the expressions of many photosynthetic genes were significantly repressed during drought stress. we analyzed the expression of a number of genes encoding products associated with chlorophyll binding, photosystem i , and psii under drought stress. the expression of tdf <dig>  which shows homology to the light-harvesting complex ii protein lhcb <dig> , significantly decreased from 0% to 20% fwl, and then remained unchanged from 30% to 50% fwl. the expressions of tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  and tdf <dig> showed a similar pattern, increasing markedly at the beginning of the drought treatment, peaking in the 20% fwl stage, decreasing dramatically from 20% to 30% fwl, and then remaining stable at 50% fwl .

stomatal responses to drought treatment
to understand the stomatal responses to drought treatment at the molecular level, stomatal-related genes were selected from our cdna-aflp data and their expression patterns during drought stress were analyzed. because potassium channels and na+/h+ antiporters play an important roles in stomatal responses to environmental cues, we analyzed the expression of tdf <dig> and tdf <dig> for expression analyses. tdf <dig> shows homology to na+/h+exchanger  gene, which encodes a plant nhx protein that has been described as an na+/h+ antiporter  <cit> . expression of tdf <dig> increased from the beginning of the drought treatment, peaked in the 20% fwl stage, and then decreased. sequence comparisons indicated that tdf <dig> encodes a potassium transporter family protein. expression of tdf <dig> decreased during the drought treatment, reached its lowest level in the 20% fwl stage, and then increased thereafter .

the protein phosphatase type c  gene family plays a major role in stomatal responses and aba signaling. we examined the expression profiles of four tdfs belonging to the pp2c family,and observed three different expression patterns: the expression of tdf <dig> and tdf <dig> increased from 0% to 20% fwl, then decreased thereafter. tdf <dig> exhibited the opposite expression pattern, decreasing from the 0% to 20% fwl stage, increasing from the 20% to 30% fwl, and then decreasing thereafter; and the expression of tdf <dig> was stable during the drought treatment. these different expression patterns suggest that the various members of the pp2c family might have different functions during drought stress .

expressions of genes related to cell expansion and apoptosis during drought stress
next, we analyzed the expression patterns of genes related to cell expansion and apoptosis during drought stress. tdf <dig> shows homology to alpha-expansin  <dig>  which encodes alpha-expansin  <dig>  a protein that increases the extensibility of the cell wall  <cit> . expression of tdf <dig> increased from the 0% to 20% fwl stages, and then decreased until the 50% fwl stage . meanwhile, blast results showed that tdf <dig> has homology to the bcl2-associated athanogene-like protein  gene, which encodes a bcl2-associated athanogene-like protein that restrains apoptosis. expression of tdf <dig> was markedly decreased from the beginning of the drought treatment, reaching its lowest level in the 20% fwl stage and then remaining at a low level thereafter .

expressions of hormone-related genes during drought stress
plant responses to different stresses are mediated by various hormonal signaling pathways. in the present study, four tdfs showed homology to genes associated with hormone signaling pathways. tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  and tdf <dig> showed homology to early-responsive to dehydration  <dig> , erd <dig>  and erd <dig>  respectively. these genes showed two types of expression pattern : expressions of tdf <dig> and tdf  <dig> increased from the beginning of the drought treatment until the 20% fwl stage, decreased to their lowest level in the 30% fwl stage, and then increased again. whereas tdf <dig> increased sharply from the beginning of the drought treatment, reached a peak in the 20% fwl stage and then decreased thereafter. tdf <dig> shows homology to the auxin-responsive protein iaa  <dig> gene, which encodes an aux/iaa protein in the auxin-mediated signaling pathway. expression of tdf <dig> gradually decreased in the 0% to 20% and 20% to 30% fwl stages, and moderately decreased in the 50% fwl stage .

discussion
drought transcriptome analysis
most tdf sequences were annotated by sequence alignments using blast searches against ncbi databases. however, tdf45- <dig>  tdf <dig>  and tdf280- <dig> had no similar sequences in any of the databases. these sequences may thus represent genes that are unique to p. hopeiensis. tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  tdf <dig>  and tdf <dig> were annotated as different members of the phosphatase 2 c gene family, and showed different expression patterns . this result suggests that members of the phosphatase 2 c gene family have different and separate functions during the drought response. transcriptome analysis showed some common drought-responsive processes. functional analyses of the tdfs indicated that metabolism is the most important process during the drought response. the various metabolic genes showed different expression patterns, reflecting their different localizations within the cell. the expressions of nine non-annotated tdfs suggest the presence of putative novel genes that may be specific to poplar and might also play important roles in dehydration stress adaptation  <cit> .

responses of photosynthesis and reactive oxygen species under drought stress
previous studies have found that photosynthesis is usually unaffected by moderate drought in other species  <cit> . in poplar, full or partial maintenance of photosynthesis at moderate stress levels is accompanied by almost no transcriptional changes in photosynthesis genes before the most severe stress levels are attained  <cit> . however, in the present study, we found that some poplar genes related to photosynthesis were upregulated until the 20% fwl stage in poplar. this result definitely indicates that candidate photosynthesis genes are upregulated in response to water stress in poplar. the expression of arabidopsis genes from psi and psii differ during moderate water-sterss treatment  <cit> . the fact that this was not the case in poplar suggests a different gene expression pattern in this species group.

reactive oxygen species  are produced in different compartments of the plant cell under both stress and non-stress conditions  <cit> . high ros concentrations are a symptom of stress. plants must maintain the ros within a certain level for normal cellular homeostasis. the ros concentration in the cell is maintained by the antioxidant system, which comprises antioxidant molecules such as ascorbate, glutathione, and a-tocopherol, as well as antioxidant enzymes such as peroxidases, catalases, and dismutases  <cit> . the induction of members of the antioxidant system is correlated with stress severity. under severe abiotic stress such as high light, salt stress, drought stress, and multiple concurrent stresses, antioxidant enzymes are differentially and strongly induced  <cit> . in the present research, the genes related to oxidative stress were divided into three types based on their expression patterns; type i genes were rapidly upregulated at the onset of stress, indicating that they may be related to the early oxidative stress response. type ii genes showed increased expression from the 30% to the 50% of fwl stage, indicating that they are associated with the mid-phase of the stress response. the expression of type iii genes gradually increased as the stress treatment continued, reaching a peak at the 50% fwl stage. therefore, these genes may be involved in the final phase of the oxidative stress response.

stomata-related genes regulate the early response to drought stress
stomatal closure under drought is an avoidance strategy adopted by plants to save water and which maintains turgor  <cit> . the channels and transporters responsible for ion transport across cell membranes are key regulators controlling stomatal aperture and water loss  <cit> . the potassium transporter protein  gene and the na+/h+exchanger  gene are down-or upregulated, consistent with their role in the inhibition of stomatal opening. the kt <dig> gene encoding an inward k+ channel is expressed in guard cells. under stress, the outward channels are induced and inward channels are repressed. consistent with this, in the present study, the inward channel gene kt <dig> showed the lowest expression level in the 20% fwl stage. the nhx <dig> gene, which encodes an na+/h+ antiporter that sequesters na+ in vacuoles within plant cells, showed the highest expression level in the 20% fwl stage. overexpression of nhx <dig> promotes the accumulation of osmolytes  to counter not only high salt high salt tolerance, but also high drought tolerance in broussonetia papyrifera <cit> . kt <dig> exprssion gradually decreased as nhx <dig> increased after the 20% fwl stage in p. hopeiensis. changes in the na+/k+ balance have been reported in p. euphratica in response to salt stress  <cit> . however, this is the first report of na+/k+ balance regulation during drought stress in poplar; an na+/k+ balance process may be involved in the poplar adaptive response to osmotic stress.

under drought treatment, poplar initially shows a drastic decrease in leaf relative water content  and stomatal conductance, but no change in the photosynthetic rate  <cit> . in the present study, the expression pattern of stomatal-related genes peaked during an early stage of drought stress. the pp2c genes are involved in aba-signaling in the guard cells, and act as negative regulators of aba signaling in stomata  <cit> . in the present research, four tdfs homologous to pp2cs were induced at an early stage of drought treatment; this is consistent with the role of pp2cs in mediating early responses. an early response in aba signaling and regulation of guard cells under stress can improve tolerance to abiotic stress  <cit> .

expression of genes related to cell expansion and apoptosis under drought stress
cell expansion is a process of cell wall modification and loosening catalyzed by enzymatic and non-enzymatic protein components of the cell wall  <cit> . a previous transcriptome analysis of arabidopsis under a progressive drought treatment showed the repression of many expansin genes  <cit> , while in another study expansin genes were induced under mild osmotic stress  <cit> . in the present research, tdf <dig>  was dramatically upregulated at the beginning of drought stress, peaked in the 20% of fwl stage, and then decreased gradually. this early peak in expansin expression can be interpreted as acclimation to moderate drought by the cell wall adjustment. this is a common type of acclimation response, which can proceed by loosening and/or tightening of cell wall structure depending on the species, organ, and tissue  <cit> . however, whereas the expression of expa <dig> was unchanged under progressive drought in arabidopsis, we found that expression of tdf <dig> markedly decreased as the stress treatment continued. this result suggests that expansins may be regulated differently in different species. the plant cell wall is required not only for mechanical support, but also for growth and adaptation to adverse environmental conditions. overexpression of expansin genes resulted in enhances growth in rice, and increases sensitivity to hormones and salt stress in arabidopsis <cit> . these observations suggest that expansins play a crucial role in the adaptive response of plants to abiotic stresses.

when proteins that have been induced by abiotic stress are damaged beyond repair, they must be eliminated to prevent aggregation. in this case, cells initiate the degradation of the damaged proteins or the destruction of entire cells   <cit> . in arabidopsis, members of the bag protein family participate in several cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and stress signaling  <cit> . in the present study, tdf <dig>  which showed homology to the bag <dig> gene, exhibited decreased expression at the beginning of drought stress, indicating that this gene is sensitive to water loss. this finding suggests that it is important to maintain proteins in their functional conformations and prevent the aggregation of nonnative proteins under stress. moreover, the expression of tdf <dig> decreased to its lowest point in the 20% fwl stage, and remained almost unchanged thereafter. this observation suggests that the 20% fwl stage is sufficient for bag gene silencing, but not for apoptosis. apoptotic regulation has been reported in foxtail millet , and thus the role of this regulator in plants should be investigated at the cellular and molecular levels  <cit> .

hormonal pathway responses to drought
rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions is essential for plant survival and for the development of tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stresses. such tolerances can be achieved by distinct metabolic and physiological adjustments, which are mediated by a number of plant hormones, and are often specific to a certain type of stress  <cit> . as a central regulator of plants’ adaptation to environmental stress, aba plays a crucial role in the regulation of transpirational water loss  <cit> . the early responsive to dehydration  gene is one of the key negative regulators of aba responses in plants. changes to the abundance of erd transcript abundance modulate aba responsiveness in arabidopsis. in the present study, we demonstrated that the expression of erd3erd <dig>  and erd <dig> responded apidly responded to water deficit. this implies that erd genes are rapid drought-responsive genes, as are the erd genes in arabidopsis. the erd gene family has at least  <dig> members. in the present study, erd3erd <dig>  and erd <dig> showed different expression patterns, indicating that various members of the erd gene family may have separate functions in the water stress response.

we observed changes in the iaa regulation pathway in response to drought. tdf <dig>  an ortholog of iaa <dig>  was upregulated at the beginning of the drought stress treatment. in poplar, rnai-mediated downregulation of iaa <dig> resulted in a severe dwarf phenotype with enhanced lateral shoot growth  <cit> . the upregulation of tdf <dig> observed in this study indicates that cell elongation was rapidly induced by moderate water stress. in general, adjustment of cell turgor pressure and elongation of root tip cells are positive responses to promote moisture absorption from the environment  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
cell expansion in response to drought has been characterized in the maize  root system as an adaptation to low water potential  <cit> . thus, in poplar, upregulation of cell extension-related genes in response to water deficit would enhance survival likelihood under water stress. previous studies have not reported transcriptional changes in photosynthesis genes before the most severe stress levels  <cit> . however, in the present study, a series of candidate photosynthesis genes upregulated in response to water stress in poplar were found. this aids our understanding of the response of the photosynthesis to water stress. transient responses to drought stress include stomatal closure, inactivation of k+ channels, and activation of na+/h+ antiporters  <cit> . changes in the expression of aba-responsive genes and ros scavengers, which are probably involved in signaling responses  <cit> , were also detected in the present study. these abundant and diverse changes reflect the complexity of the drought response in plants.

we identified  <dig> differentially expressed tdfs using the cdna-aflp technique. the transcriptome profile showed that various biological processes were involved in drought stress, and a series of candidate genes were identified, including aldhlhcb1-3expaerdnhx <dig>  kt <dig>  bag1iaa <dig>  and the pp2c gene or gene family. all of these genes were opening an interesting area for investigation of the responses of those genes to other stresses  <cit> . these data will facilitate the unraveling of the complex process of drought tolerance in poplar.
