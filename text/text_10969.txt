BACKGROUND
the vestibular system consists of  <dig> end organs, which include  <dig> semicircular canals and their associated cristae involved in angular acceleration, and two otolith organs  involved in linear acceleration, including responses to gravity. each of these end organs contains a sensory epithelium, which in mammals consists of two types of hair cells, namely type i and type ii  that have distinct distribution patterns, polarity and physiology  <cit> . bdnf is expressed in both types of differentiated hair cells in each of the sensory organs during embryonic and neonatal inner ear development  <cit> .

vestibular sensory neurons reside in the vestibular ganglia and are bipolar, sending a peripheral process  to the hair cells in their respective sensory epithelia, and a central process to the vestibular nuclei of the medulla  <cit> . two different types of afferent fibers innervate the hair cells. thick fibers innervate type i hair cells and form large calyceal endings, whereas thin fibers innervate type ii hair cells and exclusively form bouton terminals. it has been clearly shown by studies of genetic mutations in mice that in the inner ear  vestibular sensory neuron survival and innervations mainly depend on the neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase trkb and its ligand bdnf  <cit> .

bdnf/trkb activates three main intracellular signalling cascades. the ras/mitogen activated protein kinase  pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase  pathway are activated primarily through shc/frs- <dig> binding to phosphorylated tyrosine  <dig>  whereas phosphorylated y <dig> activates a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii  pathway through plcγ. we have previously described the creation of highly defined mouse models that carry tyrosine to phenylalanine  point mutations at either y <dig>  or y <dig> . using these genetic models, we have been able to show that in the central nervous system the plcγ docking site is necessary for trkb-mediated hippocampal synaptic plasticity  <cit> . moreover, a trkb y816f but not y515f point mutation impairs both the acquisition of an associative learning task and long-term potentiation  between hippocampal neurons in vivo  <cit> . recently, we have also shown that the y816f point mutation in trkb impairs acquisition of fear learning, amygdalar synaptic plasticity, and camkii signalling at synapses. in contrast, a y515f point mutation affects consolidation but not acquisition of fear learning to tone, and also alters akt activation  <cit> . in the peripheral nervous system, we have previously reported that a point mutation in the shc binding site of trkb only mildly affects vestibular sensory neuron survival, indicating that trkb receptors promote long-term survival of sensory neurons mainly in a shc site-independent manner  <cit> . in contrast, fiber growth was reduced, and target innervation by these sensory neurons was ultimately lost in trkbshc mice  <cit> . these results suggested that trkb receptor signals that maintain target innervation require the shc site. here we have asked whether the plcγ docking site of trkb would be responsible for the fiber guidance role of trkb reported in the inner ear  <cit> , possibly through activation of trpc channels as recently demonstrated in vitro  <cit> . we find that the major function of the plcγ site downstream of trkb is fiber guidance, but surprisingly only inside the vestibular sensory epithelia, with limited effects on the survival of vestibular sensory neurons and growth of afferent processes toward the sensory epithelia. we also demonstrate that double point mutations in both the shc and the plcγ docking sites   <cit>  results in a loss of vestibular neurons that is essentially indistinguishable from that of trkb null mice , suggesting that the survival function of bdnf/trkb is mediated predominantly through the cooperative action of these two docking sites, whereas the plcγ site-activated signalling pathway of trkb is essential for the proper intraepithelial navigation of fibers. in addition, we show that the transformation of afferent dendritic boutons into calyces requires bdnf/trkb signalling via the plcγ docking site, revealing the requirement of this site for structural plasticity of sensory neurons.

RESULTS
vestibular neurons survive in the absence of a functional trkb plcγ site, but not in absence of both the plcγ and the shc sites
previously we have shown that a point mutation at the shc site of trkb only partially affects the survival of inner ear vestibular neurons  compared to control mice at postnatal day  <dig>   <cit> . neurons remaining at p <dig> survived into adulthood, indicating that activation of pathways independent of the shc site support the survival of vestibular neurons given that in the trkb-/- mutants the majority of these neurons are already lost at birth  <cit> . vestibular ganglia of trkbplc/plc mutants, which are homozygous for the y816f point mutation, and control mice  were analysed to determine if the plcγ site of trkb supports vestibular neuron survival. neuronal counts revealed a comparable number of sensory neurons in the vestibular ganglion of trkbplc/plc mutants at p <dig> compared to the control genotypes  . we then determined whether the two tyrosines comprising the shc and the plcγ docking sites together mediate the functions of trkb in the vestibular ganglion. homozygous double point mutant mice  <cit>  showed a loss of vestibular neurons equivalent to that of trkb-/- mice   <cit> , and had a complete lack of afferent innervations to the posterior canal cristae with only an occasional fiber projecting to the anterior and horizontal cristae . the innervations to the utricle and saccule were reduced and closely resembled those of bdnf-/- mice  <cit>  and of trkb-/- mice  <cit>  previously reported. similar effects were also obtained for the efferent innervations to the ear .

previously, it was shown that deletion of trkb or bdnf reduces radial fiber density in the apex of the cochlea  <cit> , a region that normally expresses high levels of bdnf during development  <cit> . mice carrying a point mutation at the plcγ site of trkb did not show any deficits in the cochlea , and only mild defects were found in the cochlea of the trkbshc/shc point mutants  <cit> . in contrast, mice lacking both the plcγ and the shc docking sites of trkb had an obvious reduction in radial fiber density in the cochlea  compared to control mice . these data strongly support the idea that the intracellular signalling of trkb predominantly depends on these two docking sites, as the vestibular and cochlear phenotypes resulting from their mutation produces a virtually identical phenotype to that seen in trkb null mutant animals.

trkb/plcγ signalling is necessary for fiber guidance in the sensory epithelium
previously, counts of nerve fibers to a single vestibular sensory epithelium  showed that trkbshc/shc point mutant mice had reduced fiber growth with the remaining fibers exhibiting a reduction in nerve diameter and loss of myelin  <cit> . we carried out a similar analysis in trkbplc/plc mutants by counting all nerve fibers to the pc sensory epithelium and found no differences in the number of nerve fibers apparent in juvenile or adult mutant mice, compared to controls , which was particularly apparent by transmission electron microscopy analysis  . these data suggest that the plcγ signalling downstream of trkb is not required for vestibular neuron fiber growth or maintenance, but rather functions in certain aspects of fiber maturation pertaining to their degree of myelination.

we next investigated nerve fiber innervation toward and within the vestibular sensory epithelia. the afferent fibers were targeted to a given sensory epithelia in both the trkbplc/plc point mutant and the control animals at p <dig> and p <dig>  showing no fibers outside the sensory epithelia . nerve fibers targeting the vestibular sensory epithelia were also observed in the trkbshc/shc point mutants  <cit> , and in the trkbd/d point mutants . thus, nerve fiber targeting to the sensory epithelia mediated by bdnf  <cit>  must use signalling mechanisms independent of the trkb/shc or plcγ sites and/or factors other than bdnf/trkb signaling such as nt3/trkc.

closer examination of the nerve fiber trajectories within the sensory epithelia showed aberrations in the trkbplc/plc point mutant mice that were not found in the trkbwt/wt control mice  nor in the trkb+/+ mice . as early as p <dig>  the trkbwt/wt, like the trkb+/+, control mice showed obvious targeting of nerve fibers toward hair cells and already partial formation of calyces . conversely, in trkbplc/plc point mutants, nerve fibers extended for long distances along the perimeter of sensory epithelia . it is noteworthy that these fibers did not leave the sensory epithelia despite their obvious disorientation. in addition, at this stage these nerve fibers rarely engaged in the formation of calyces as compared to the trkbwt/wt controls .

we further investigated calyx development at p <dig>  a stage when most calyces are present  <cit> . labeling of afferent fibers from the cerebellum and the brainstem showed distinct groups of labelled fibers in control mice, apparently situated on either side of the striola region . interestingly, trkbplc/plc point mutant mice showed a comparable distribution of fibers labelled from the cerebellum and the brainstem as control mice , however, two major differences were immediately apparent even at low magnification. firstly, many fibers in the trkbplc/plc mutants crossed into the vicinity of the other fiber compartments and circled along the sensory epithelia perimeter, occasionally for several  <dig> μm . secondly, despite the apparently normal fiber density, the calyces detected in the trkbplc/plc point mutants were almost exclusively inside the striola region , whereas controls at p <dig> showed numerous calyces and good segregation of nerve fibers into discrete territories up to the perimeter of the utricle . only a few fibers were near the margin of the sensory epithelium, and the fibers showed numerous branches consistent with their innervating type ii hair cells  <cit> . in contrast, trkbplc/plc point mutants displayed little fiber segregation, with both those at the margin and within the epithelium broadly overlapping . similar effects were found in the other four vestibular epithelia . comparable results were also observed in older mutants  and control mice . this phenotype results in impaired balance in trkbplc/plc mutants compared to control mice. the trkbplc/plc mice showed a higher basal locomotor activity and displayed circling behavior, in either direction, compared to wild-type control mice ) .

overall, these data suggest that a point mutation at the plcγ site of trkb causes disorientation of afferent fibers inside the vestibular sensory epithelia. in addition, nerve fibers either do not find type i hair cells or cannot engage in calyx formation, as a reduction in both the distribution and the degree of differentiation of calyces is apparent.

ultra structural analysis confirms the inability of calyx formation in trkbplc/plc point mutants
we next investigated the formation of calyces in histological sections of p <dig> and p <dig> control and trkbplc/plc point mutants. histological sections clearly revealed formation of calyces in all vestibular epithelia of control mice already at p <dig> , as previously described  <cit> . in contrast, trkbplc/plc mutants showed little evidence of calyx formation in any vestibular sensory epithelium . likewise, electron microscopy  analysis showed limited and mostly partial calyx formation throughout the vestibular epithelia of trkbplc/plc mutants, in particular in the utricle , with the exception of an occasional calyx-like structure around the striola region of the utricle . in the canal cristae calyx formation was almost absent and only formation of boutons was apparent , indicating that the conditions for calyx formation inside and outside of the striola region and between sensory epithelia differ.

trpc <dig> is overexpressed in vestibular organs of trkbplc/plc mutants and may lead to the fiber misdirection
bdnf signalling has been shown to induce chemo-attractive turning of axonal growth cones in vitro  <cit> . moreover, it has also been shown that bdnf-induced guidance of nerve growth cones in rat cerebellar granule cell cultures depends on the activation of signalling downstream of the plcγ site of trkb and ca2+ elevation  <cit> . trpc channels, in particular trpc3/ <dig>  mediated the bdnf-induced elevation of ca2+ in these cells, and were required for the nerve-growth cone turning induced by bdnf  <cit> . because individual fibers inside the sensory epithelia showed impaired guidance in trkbplc/plc mutants compared to controls , we decided to investigate the involvement of trpc channels in fiber misdirection in the vestibular sensory epithelia of trkbplc/plc mutants. we first examined the expression of trpc1- <dig> by rt-pcr analyses using total rna preparations from dissected vestibular ganglion tissue of young adult cf- <dig> male mice . positive control samples consisted of cdna templates derived from a pool of total rnas prepared from mouse embryonic day  <dig>  brain and retina. as shown in fig. 8a-b, trpc <dig>  2s,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in both vestibular tissue and e <dig> brain/retina. since trpc3/ <dig>  but not trpc <dig>  has been shown to be essential in the guidance of nerve growth cones by bdnf  <cit> , we examined the expression of trpc <dig> in the vestibular organ of trkbplc/plc mutants and control  mice. as shown in fig. 8c, trpc <dig> was overexpressed in the trkbplc/plc mutants compared to controls . moreover, mrna levels of the neuronal marker neuron-specific enolase  were not significantly different between the trkbplc/plc mutants and the control genotypes . we also anlysed trpc <dig> channel expression by rt-pcr and found no differences between all genotypes analysed .

kcnq <dig> shows normal distribution in trkbplc/plc mutants
kcnq <dig> is an m-type k+ channel expressed in sensory hair cells of the inner ear and in the central auditory pathway. previous work had suggested that kcnq <dig> expression is restricted to the vestibular afferent calyx-like nerve endings ensheathing the type i hair cells  <cit> . however, an analysis of conditional bdnf null mutant mice has revealed that type i hair cells express kcnq <dig> in the absence of afferent and/or efferent innervations in the vestibular canal cristae  <cit> . immunohistochemical analyses revealed no differences in the expression pattern of kcnq <dig> in the canal cristae and the utricle of trkbplc/plc and control mice at both p <dig> and p <dig> . therefore, the distribution of type i hair cells is normal at a time  when calyx formation is already affected in the absence of the plcγ site of trkb. by p <dig>  the intensity of the immunohistochemical response of kcnq <dig> in the tissue from trkbplc/plc mutants compared to control tissue was reduced , suggesting that calyx formation does not regulate the expression pattern of kcnq <dig>  but its expression level in type i hair cells is influenced by proper innervation.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase trkb is primarily known for its function during peripheral and central nervous system development  <cit> . in the cns it is only recently emerging as a potent regulator of synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus as well as of other brain regions, and the signalling pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in these functions are beginning to be revealed  <cit> . as for the peripheral nervous system, in order to dissect the signalling pathways involved in the predominant functions of trkb receptors, such as neuronal survival as well as target innervation, we have chosen the vestibular organ as a model. we have previously reported that a point mutation at the shc site of trkb has limited effects on vestibular sensory neuron survival, indicating that trkb receptors promote long-term survival of sensory neurons mainly in a shc site-independent manner  <cit> . in contrast, target innervations of these sensory neurons were eventually lost in trkbshc mice; at p <dig> both afferent and efferent fibers were evident to all sensory epithelia, however by p <dig> they were greatly reduced  <cit> , revealing that signalling through the shc site of trkb is required to maintain target innervations. however, no molecular data has been known until now concerning the growth of vestibular fibers toward specific vestibular hair cell types and, in the saccule and utricle, toward hair cells of different polarity. it was recently shown that fibers targeting hair cells of different polarity have distinct central projections  <cit> , but the mechanisms underlying these features are unclear. we now show that in the absence of the plcγ docking site of trkb the apparent segregation of fibers from distinct central projection areas is partially disrupted. in particular, we show that while the growth of vestibular afferents to inner ear sensory epithelia are unaffected in trkbplc mutants, these fibers run along the peripheral margin of the sensory epithelia without taking sharp turns to innervate their specific hair cells as in control mice . thus, signalling elicited through the plc-γ site of trkb is involved in targeting processes inside the sensory epithelia. this is consistent with previous reports showing that targeted growth to sensory epithelia does not require neurotrophins  <cit> , does not require differentiated hair cells  <cit> , and can occur in the absence of sensory epithelia formation  <cit> . moreover, it is the cooperation of both the shc and the plcγ docking sites of trkb  <cit>  that mediate the survival of the vestibular neurons, as the phenotype of the trkbd mice with respect to the loss of these cells is essentially indistinguishable from that observed in trkb null mice.

the trpc3/ <dig> calcium channels have been shown to mediate the bdnf-induced elevation of ca2+ in rat cerebellar granule cell cultures and to be required for the nerve-growth cone turning induced by bdnf in these cells  <cit> . here we show that trpc <dig> is overexpressed in vestibular neurons of trkbplc point mutants. overexpression of the trpc <dig> channel has been reported to interfere with the cellular calcium homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , this could explain the misdirection of fibers observed in the trkbplc/plc mutants. we show that calyx formation around type i hair cells in the vestibular sensory epithelia requires bdnf/trkb signalling via the plcγ docking site. in absence of this site, fibers show a limited ability to switch from growth to calyx formation.

past research has convincingly shown that absence of any fibers at any time does not interfere with the maturation of recognizable type i and type ii vestibular hair cells  <cit>  implying that this process is cell autonomous. indeed, we show here that the development of morphologic characteristics of type i hair cells does not depend on the formation of a calyx. instead, we suggest that calyx formation is mediated through the plcγ activated signalling pathway downstream of the trkb receptor. in the absence of this pathway, fibers cannot be converted in fully developed calyces and form bouton terminals instead. of note is the fact that type i hair cells receive efferent terminals  which are virtually excluded from these cells by the developed calyx in wild type mice, and suggest that formation of a calyx is directly related to the exclusion of direct efferent innervations on type i hair cells. it remains unclear what exactly are the differences in the bdnf release from type i and type ii hair cells, both of which are strongly positive for bdnf in embryos  <cit> . closer examination of the amounts of bdnf expressed in postnatal type i and type ii hair cells is necessary to understand whether there is a differential expression of bdnf in one of the two differentiating hair cell types thereby contributing to the transformation of boutons into calyces via the trkb/plcγ signalling activated pathway. it is entirely possible that the downregulation of bdnf expression in postnatal ears  <cit>  is different in the two hair cell types and thus provides the proper signalling for afferent transformation into calyces.

in summary, these data support the notion that the trkb/plcγ site activated pathway mediate structural synaptic plasticity in the pns. indeed, our data showing the lack of proper development of afferent calyces on differentiated type i vestibular hair cells demonstrate clearly that bdnf signalling through the trkb/plcγ site activated pathway is an essential component of this structural synaptic plasticity.
