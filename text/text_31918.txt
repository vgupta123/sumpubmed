BACKGROUND
pax <dig> is a transcription factor containing an n-terminal dna binding domain, a paired domain, separated by a glycine-rich linker sequence from a second dna binding domain, a homeodomain, and a c-terminal proline-serine-threonine-rich transregulatory domain. it is highly conserved in very diverse species. in mammals, it is expressed during development in the eye, in specific regions of the cns, in the nasal placodes and olfactory epithelium and in the pancreas  <cit> . haploinsufficiency for pax <dig> function  in the mouse results in the small eye  phenotype  <cit> . homozygotes  die perinatally with no eyes and many brain abnormalities  <cit> . pax <dig> haploinsufficiency also causes eye and brain defects in humans  <cit> .

normal development requires not only that pax <dig> be present in certain cells at certain times but also that it be present in the correct amounts. schedl et al.  <cit>  showed that severe eye abnormalities are caused not only by under-expression but also by over-expression of pax <dig> in mice. bishop et al.  <cit>  and muzio et al.  <cit>  provided evidence that graded expression of pax <dig> across the developing neocortex of mice is essential for the correct specification of its major areas. such findings imply that pax <dig> expression is tightly regulated and that different levels are maintained in different regions as they grow.

work on humans has indicated that the pax <dig> regulatory elements extend over more than two hundred kilobases  <cit> . the locus is highly conserved, both in the coding regions  and also in the non-coding regions, where similar long-range control elements have been identified in mouse and fugu by genomic sequence comparisons and dnasei hypersensitivity analysis  <cit> . a yac  containing  <dig> kb of the human coding sequence and flanking regions, extending beyond its putative regulatory elements, rescues the mouse pax6-/- phenotype, whereas a yac containing  <dig> kb less flanking sequence does not  <cit> . in the work described here, we modified y <dig> by introducing tau-gfp and neomycin resistance cassettes so that they would be controlled by the gene's regulatory elements and would prevent the production of pax <dig> protein from the translational start site in exon  <dig> . this new yac  was then used to generate transgenic mice.

RESULTS
initial characterization of transgenic mice
y <dig> was successfully modified as illustrated in fig.  <dig> and as described in methods to generate y <dig>  this yac was used to generate transgenic mice. three fertile transgenic founders, named dty <dig>  dty <dig> and dty <dig>  were identified. they all appeared phenotypically normal and successfully transmitted a tau-gfp-expressing y <dig> transgene to their offspring. pcr with primers marked in fig.  <dig>  was used to examine the minimum extent of incorporation of y1123: the results indicated that only dty <dig> had incorporated at least the majority of y <dig>  whereas dty <dig> and dty <dig> had incorporated truncated versions. neither dty <dig> nor dty <dig> recapitulated the full expression pattern of pax <dig>  it was possible to identify dty <dig> and dty <dig> transgenic mice using a hand-held torch emitting blue light, of the wavelength required to excite gfp, and an appropriate filter, as described in  <cit> . this revealed gfp expression in the eyes of living dty <dig> and dty <dig> mice; the eyes of dty <dig> mice did not express gfp. dty <dig> mice expressed gfp only in the eyes. using dty <dig> mice, y <dig> was crossed into embryos that were either pax6+/- or pax6-/-. unlike the unmodified yac y <dig>  <cit> , y <dig> produced no rescue of either the eye or brain defects in these mutants, confirming its predicted lack of function.

quantitative pcr  was used to compare relative fluorescence intensities following amplification with primers specific for human pax <dig> and mouse pax <dig> or for human pax <dig> and mouse pax <dig>  intensities following amplification for mouse pax <dig> and pax <dig> were halved . the ratios between the intensities from pax <dig> and half the intensities from pax <dig> and pax <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  we conclude that one copy of y <dig>  had integrated into the genome of each founder. fluorescent in situ hybridization  using the entire fat <dig> cosmid  as a probe  <cit>  on blood smears from dty <dig> showed a single signal per cell, confirming that there were not multiple sites of integration. dty <dig> and dty <dig> were not studied further here.

expression of tau-gfp in dty <dig> mice
to test whether the tau-gfp expression in dty <dig> mice was consistent with the established pax <dig> expression pattern, embryos were collected at embryonic day   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  and eyes were taken from adults. expression of tau-gfp was seen in the eyes at all ages; examples are shown at e <dig>  , e <dig>   and e <dig>  . expression was present in the retina and lens, as expected, and allowed cellular processes to be visualised due to cytoplasmic labelling by tau-gfp. particularly striking was label in the axonal projections of retinal ganglion cells, which could be seen in the optic nerve  and followed through the optic chiasm into the optic tract . elsewhere, tau-gfp expression was confined to regions known to express pax <dig>  <cit> . as expected, expression at e <dig> â€“ <dig>  was in the forebrain , with a sharp posterior boundary of expression at the diencephalic/mesencephalic boundary  <cit> , and also in the hindbrain and spinal cord . figure 3f shows a parasagittal section through the brain at e <dig> : expression was in the cerebral cortex, prethalamus , pretectum, the basal plate in the region of the pons  <cit>  and in the cerebellar primordium  <cit> . the intensity of label in the cerebral cortex was graded from high rostrally to low caudally , in line with the known gradient of expression of pax <dig>  which is shown using an anti-pax <dig> antibody in fig. 3m <cit> . similar to earlier ages, there was a sharp posterior boundary of expression at the border between pretectum and midbrain   <cit> . in coronal sections, expression of tau-gfp was seen in the pineal gland  and nearby in the posterior commissure , which are also sites of pax <dig> expression  <cit> . there was expression in the prethalamus  in a pattern similar to that shown with an anti-pax <dig> antibody . in the pallium , there was a boundary of expression at the border between the pallium and subpallium, in agreement with the known boundary of pax <dig> expression   <cit> . label was seen running ventrally to the amygdaloid region , mirroring the known expression of pax <dig> in this area  <cit> . in the cerebral cortex, tau-gfp was seen in the radial processes of cells located on the ventricular side of the cortical wall ; again, this was anticipated since pax <dig> is known to be expressed in radial glial cells  <cit> . there was expression in the olfactory epithelium   <cit> .

immunhistochemistry with anti-pax <dig> and anti-gfp antibodies confirmed the presence of gfp in pax6-expressing regions. an example of co-localization at e <dig>  is shown in fig. 4: pax <dig> is expressed on the pallial side of the pallial/subpallial border , as is tau-gfp . overall, we concluded that the patterns of label with tau-gfp are exactly as anticipated on the basis of the known expression of pax <dig> and that regional differences in the intensity of label in the cerebral cortex reflect known differences in the level of expression of pax <dig> 

analysis of dty <dig> brains with flow cytometry
one of the potential uses of this transgenic mouse is to allow the isolation of pax6-expressing cells. we demonstrated that this is possible using flow cytometry on dissociated cells from the brains of e <dig>  embryos. the telencephalic vesicles were removed and each was cut into dorsal, lateral and ventral components. data are shown in fig.  <dig>  analysis of non-transgenic embryos provided frequency distributions of background fluorescence intensity . a gate was set to cover intensities above the upper limit of the fluorescence seen in these controls, on the basis that cells falling within this gate in transgenic embryos  were certain to be expressing tau-gfp. in samples from dorsal telencephalon of dty <dig> embryos , a large proportion of cells had fluorescence levels within the gate. there were also large numbers of cells whose fluorescence intensities were not within the gate but were higher than the average intensity in non-transgenic controls. it is likely that these are cells expressing gfp at lower levels; for example, many may be in the process of down-regulating the transgene as they differentiate, which is the pattern of expression of pax <dig>  <cit> . a similar picture was seen in samples from the lateral and ventral telencephalon . the average fluorescence intensity of cells within the gate was higher in the lateral telencephalon than in the dorsal telencephalon , which agrees with the brighter fluorescence of cells in this region in sections . the proportion of cells within the gate was smallest in samples from the ventral telencephalon , which agrees with the fact that fewer cells in this region express pax <dig> .

discussion
in dty <dig>  the modified yac that had integrated into the mouse genome did not affect the endogenous pax <dig> locus, unlike an alternative strategy involving the insertion of a reporter gene into the endogenous locus  <cit> . the yac <dig> transgene can be crossed onto mice with any pax <dig> status  to identify and isolate those cells in which pax <dig> is being activated by upstream factors. in addition to generating a useful new tool for understanding the role of pax <dig>  our results demonstrate that the elements regulating the human pax <dig> gene present in y <dig> and y <dig>  <cit>  are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate accurately the expression of pax <dig> in mice. this indicates that these elements are not only structurally  <cit>  but also functionally highly conserved. in their original study of mice containing human pax6-expressing yacs, schedl et al.  <cit>  suggested functional conservation of the regulatory elements controlling the human and mouse genes on the basis that the human locus is able to complement the sey mutation in mouse. the introduction of pax6-producing transgenes corrected the eye defects in heterozygotes and rescued homozygotes from perinatal death. it remained unclear, however, how accurately the human regulatory elements reproduce the pattern of endogenous mouse pax <dig> expression. although y <dig> must have caused re-expression of the missing factor in those cells that normally express it, thereby rescuing their abnormal phenotypes, additional ectopic expression from y <dig> might have gone undetected. our current work complements that of schedl et al.  <cit>  by demonstrating a remarkable conservation of function of the pax6/pax <dig> regulatory elements in the two species.

recently, kim and lauderdale  <cit>  described the generation of a bacterial artificial chromosome  transgenic reporter mouse containing  <dig> kb of mouse genomic dna from around the mouse pax <dig> gene. unlike the yac transgene described here, the bac transgene did not generate expression in diencephalic and olfactory cells that are known to express pax <dig>  a likely explanation for this difference is that the shorter bac transgene is missing some important regulatory elements. figure  <dig> compares yac y <dig>  with bac mbac293d <dig>  <cit> . bac mbac293d <dig> lacks the genomic region between elp <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig> that comprises part of the downstream regulatory region  in the human. lagan/vista pairwise alignment identifies five highly conserved regions that could contain regulatory elements responsible for differences in expression between the transgenic reporter mice carrying mbac293d <dig> and y <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides further evidence that the pax6/pax <dig> regulatory elements are highly conserved not only structurally but also functionally in mice and humans. y <dig> provides an excellent tool for studying the functions of different pax6/pax <dig> regulatory elements and will allow the analysis and isolation of cells in which pax <dig> is activated, irrespective of the status of the endogenous locus.
