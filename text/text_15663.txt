BACKGROUND
extracellular enzymes from streptococcus pyogenes have been extensively studied and shown to be of importance for the pathogenesis of this human pathogen . the secreted s. pyogenes enzyme endos  has a specific endoglycosidase activity on native human igg by hydrolyzing the conserved asparagine-linked glycans found on each heavy chain of igg  <cit> . endos-activity affects the functionality of opsonizing igg by decreased binding to fc-receptors and impaired classical complement activation, and endos treatment of human opsonizing igg antibodies directed towards the cell-wall anchored m protein significantly enhances bacterial survival in human blood  <cit> . the ndos gene encoding endos is present in all tested isolates, and is highly conserved. both healthy and infected humans have circulating antibodies against endos, suggesting in vivo expression  <cit> . in addition, endos is up regulated when interacting with white blood cells  <cit> . the activity of endos on igg may be beneficial for s. pyogenes expressing this enzyme with modulation and/or evasion of an igg-mediated response against the bacteria. in contrast to this, the purified form of endos has substantial potential as a therapeutical agent against antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and other conditions where igg is involved in pathological processes. it has recently been shown that pre-treatment of arthritogenic igg antibodies with endos abrogates development of arthritis in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis  <cit> .

one of the most studied streptococcal enzymes is the cysteine proteinase, speb. several in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as clinical studies have suggested a role for speb as an important virulence factor  <cit> . speb has the ability to degrade the human extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and vitronectin, release inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1β and bradykinin from their precursors, cleave or degrade immunoglobulins and complement factors, and also bind to the human cell surface receptors integrins  <cit> . in addition, speb releases active fragments from cell wall-anchored proteins from the bacterium itself, cleaves the secreted pore-forming streptolysin o that retains its cytolytic activity after processing, and degrades superantigens  <cit> .

endos and speb from s. pyogenes are functionally related in that they both hydrolyze igg leading to impairment of opsonizing antibodies and thus enhance bacterial survival in human blood  <cit> .

in this study, we further investigated the relationship between endos and speb by examining their in vitro temporal production and reveal a novel activity of speb; processing and eventually complete degradation of endos with loss of its igg hydrolyzing activity. furthermore, theoretical structure modeling of endos combined with site-directed mutagenesis and chemical blocking of amino acids identified amino acids required for the igg glycan-hydrolyzing activity of endos.

RESULTS
temporal production of endos and speb
s. pyogenes strain ap <dig> was cultured in a medium for optimal expression of endos and speb  <cit> , and culture supernatant samples were withdrawn at indicated time points . secretion of speb and endos was analyzed using western blots with polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the zymogen form of speb and full-length endos. expression of intact endos  was observed after approximately  <dig> hours in late exponential growth phase . however, when samples were collected at  <dig> hours of incubation an additional band with an apparent mass of  <dig> kda reacted with the endos antibodies . furthermore, the total amount of the  <dig> kda band decreased between  <dig> and  <dig> hours of culturing suggesting further degradation of this fragment of endos. interestingly, the appearance of this  <dig> kda endos fragment coincides with the maturation and processing of speb from its  <dig> kda zymogen form into its proteolytically active  <dig> kda form . this observation suggested that speb is involved in the processing/degradation of endos, and we hypothesized that this could be of importance in regulating endos activity.

speb hydrolyzes endos during growth and in purified form
in order to confirm that speb hydrolyzes endos, we cultured the wild type strain ap <dig> for  <dig> hours in cm with or without the reducing agent dtt  and analyzed the status of endos and speb using western blots. under reducing conditions the ap <dig> strain nearly completely degraded endos protein, while under the slightly reducing condition in cm alone endos was only partly hydrolyzed , which suggests that speb is responsible for the hydrolysis of endos. analysis using speb antibodies revealed that under non-reducing conditions the ap <dig> strains produces mainly the  <dig> kda active form of speb, but some  <dig> kda could be detected, while under reducing conditions only the active form of speb could be detected . the  <dig> kda band reacting with the endos antibodies in lane a figure 2a was sequenced by edman degradation  <cit>  revealing the sequence kdksydli corresponding to amino acids 446– <dig> of the endos sequence . thus, one speb cleavage site in endos is between leu- <dig> and lys- <dig>  but smaller degradations products reacting with the antibodies could also be seen. to confirm speb activity on endos, we cultured the isogenic speb mutant al <dig>  <cit>  in cm and analyzed the supernatant as above. this showed that al <dig> is unable to hydrolyze endos even in the presence of dtt . a confirmation that al <dig> does not produce any active speb is seen in . as a control experiment, strain mc <dig> mutated in the ndos gene was analyzed under the same conditions. this revealed that mc <dig> does not produce any endos , while it still produces speb as wild type ap <dig> . taken together, speb cleaves endos into a main  <dig> kda fragment and several smaller fragments during growth, but it remained unclear whether the remainder of endos was completely degraded or simply not recognized by the endos-antibodies.

to further investigate the hydrolysis of endos, recombinantly expressed endos  was incubated with serial dilutions of speb. this revealed that speb processes rendos into two major fragments of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda . visual inspection and whole lane densitometry analysis  showed that the total amount of rendos also diminished, indicating that besides processing into two fairly stable fragments, speb unspecifically degrades endos into low molecular weight fragments. in addition, endos was incubated at an enzyme: substrate ratio of 1: <dig> with thermolysin for one hour. despite  <dig> predicted thermolysin sites in the mature  <dig> kda form of endos, two major fragments of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda, similarly to what could be seen with speb, resisted proteolysis .

analysis of primary structure and homology modeling of endos
endos contains a  <dig> amino acids n-terminal signal sequence that has been verified by amino-terminal sequencing  <cit> , an amino-terminal part comprising amino acids 37– <dig> which harbors a family  <dig> glycosyl hydrolase active site motif at position 227– <dig>  <cit>  . the remaining part  of endos carboxy-terminally to the speb cleavage site  is similar to leucine-rich repeat proteins  from the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis  <cit> , the tetanus-causing clostridium tetani  <cit> , and from the intracellular pathogen listeria monocytogenes   <cit>  . no functions have been ascribed to the lrr's most similar to endos, but lrr's belonging the internalin family of proteins from listeria spp. are essential for cellular attachment and internalization through binding of e-cadherin  <cit> . endos contains three highly similar leucine-rich repeats of approximately  <dig> amino acids between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  and two additional repeats between  <dig> and  <dig> with lower leucine content and with a somewhat lower similarity as detected by the radar algorithm  <cit> .

despite a wide variety of folds, the overall topology of glycosyl hydrolases can be divided into three main groups where the active site is within a pocket, a cleft or a tunnel. the varying degree of accessibility to the active site has been suggested to determine the carbohydrate substrate specificity  <cit> . since the only substrate for endos known to date is the complex bi-antennary glycan on native igg, we attempted to predict the structure of endos using homology modeling. amino acids 37– <dig> of endos was aligned with endof <dig> from elizabethkingia meningoseptica   <cit>  and subjected to automated protein homology modeling using endof <dig>  as the template. the generated model of amino acids 37– <dig> covers the active site and displays a typical 8-barrel with eight repeated β-strand/loop/α-helix units with the parallel β-strands forming an eight-stranded β-barrel . the putative catalytic glu- <dig> residue in the fgh <dig> active site is located at the orifice of the β-barrel. when superimposing the endos model on the endof <dig> structure, two additional antiparallel β-strands protrudes at the top of the barrel close to the catalytic glu residue, and there are two extended loops with antiparallel β-strands on opposite sides of the molecule. both endos and endof <dig> hydrolyse biantennary complex carbohydrates  <cit> . the modeled β-barrel in endos potentially only accommodates certain glycans and could partly explain endos' specificity for the n-linked carbohydrate on human igg, even though its activity has been suggested to depend on additional protein-protein interactions  <cit> . hypothetically, the additional extended loops in the endos could contribute to the specificity by interactions with the protein backbone of the igg heavy chain. homology models should be interpreted with great caution, but the endos model could serve as a starting point for rational mutagenesis, interaction studies with igg, and attempts to crystallize defined parts of the molecule.

since endos contains lrr's with similarities to other bacterial lrr proteins we attempted to generate a model of this region to investigate if endos has the potential of adopting a similar structure known to be important for protein-protein interaction and virulence in listeria spp. using the same approach as for the amino-terminal part we were able to construct a model of amino acids 446– <dig> of endos using the lrr region of internalin b  from listeria monocytogenes as a template  <cit> . this model revealed a bowed tube structure with five parallel β-strands forming a β-sheet that constitute the concave face of the structure in a similar manner as can be seen in inlb . in the endos-lrr model there is only one complete β-loop-helix-loop motif that can be seen in several lrr proteins including inlb. furthermore, it is unclear from this model if the carboxy-terminal part of endos has the kind of cap structure that can be seen in inlb. nevertheless, it is intriguing that a secreted s. pyogenes protein has structural similarity with lrr's of internalins that are crucial for cellular invasion and virulence. furthermore, since the concave face of other lrr's including inlb has been suggested to be a major site for protein interactions, the model of the lrr region in endos could be used as a starting point for finding potential cellular and protein targets in the human host.

site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification of tryptophans inactivates endos
sequence analysis suggested that glu- <dig> is part of the glycosyl hydrolase motif and possibly the catalytically active amino acid. furthermore, the positioning of glu- <dig> at the orifice of the -barrel as suggested by homology modeling identified this amino acid as prime catalytic residue candidate . therefore we mutated glu- <dig> in rendos to glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis of the ndos gene and recombinantly expressed endos. this protein was tested for activity against purified human igg by sds-page and lectin blot analysis. this revealed that endos, but not endos could shift the apparent mass of the igg heavy chain approx.  <dig> kda  indicating that endos has lost its activity on igg. furthermore, igg heavy chains incubated with endos but not endos loose the reactivity against the mannose-specific biotinylated lectin lens culinaris agglutinin  . we have previously shown that lack of lectin signal from igg corresponds well to complete hydrolysis of the chitobiose core of the igg-glycan as analyzed by mass spectroscopy of hydrolyzed igg  <cit> . this experiment confirmed that glu- <dig> is essential for the igg-glycan hydrolyzing activity of endos.

another approach to investigate which amino acids that are important for enzymatic activity involves chemical modification of certain types of amino acids. it has previously been shown that chemical blocking of tryptophans in a β-n-acetylglucosaminidase from the mollusk batillus cornutus  inhibits chitinase activity  <cit> . furthermore, tryptophans situated on extended loops outside the catalytic site are essential for substrate binding and enzymatic activity in a chitinase from streptomyces griseus  <cit> . this was intriguing, since  <dig> tryptophans are present in the amino-terminal part of endos of which one is located inside the predicted -barrel with glu- <dig> at the orifice, and three  in the predicted extended loops that distinguish endos from the template endof <dig> . furthermore, there are four more tryptophan residues in the carboxy-terminal part located carboxy-terminally to the lrr. therefore we investigated if n-bromosuccinimide  could affect the enzymatic activity of endos. nbs can react with the indole group of tryptophan and with sh groups of cysteines and are commonly used for characterization amino acid residues involved in enzymatic activity  <cit> . after modification of endos with nbs, no igg glycan hydrolysis could be seen as analyzed by sds-page and lca lectin blot analysis . treatment of endos with iodoacetamide  or n-ethylmaleimide , reagents used for blockage of cysteines , or modification of lysines using formaldehyde, did not affect the hydrolysis of igg by endos . these results suggest that lysine  and cysteine residues  in endos are not essential for the enzymatic activity, while tryptophans in the predicted β-barrel, in the extended loops, and/or in the carboxy-terminal part are required for the igg glycan-hydrolyzing activity of endos.

speb ultimately inactivates endos
to investigate whether speb-hydrolyzed endos has activity on the glycan on igg, rendos was treated for increasing amount of time with speb prior to incubation with human igg. this revealed that speb hydrolyzes endos in a time-dependent manner and that after  <dig> hours of incubation virtually no full-length endos is present. the smaller protein fragment can still be detected after  <dig> hours and the larger fragment can be detected after  <dig> h . this corresponds well to the observations of the presence and state of the two enzymes during growth of s. pyogenes; when active speb starts to appear after 12– <dig> hours of growth the first signs of endos-hydrolysis can be seen, and 2– <dig> hours later no full-length endos can be detected . furthermore, the igg glycan-hydrolyzing activities of the same samples were analyzed by sds-page and lca lectin blot. this revealed that after  <dig> hours of incubation no igg glycan hydrolyzing activity could be detected . this indicates that full-length endos is required for activity on igg and that speb eventually inactivates the igg glycan-hydrolyzing activity of endos.

in this study we show that endos and speb are coordinately expressed during growth in vitro, and that when speb maturates into its active form it starts to degrade endos, but two major fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> kda seems somewhat more resistant to proteolysis. fragments of similar sizes are also generated by the protease thermolysin suggesting that there are domains in endos that are partly protected against proteolysis, of which one most likely is the  <dig> kda carboxy-terminal fragment identified by amino-terminal sequencing. speb-processing and/or degradation of proteins from the bacterium itself seem to be important mechanisms for inactivation or release of biologically active fragments or domains. speb processes the pore-forming streptolysin o  <cit> , releases functional fragments from the cell-wall anchored c5a-peptidase and igg-binding m proteins  <cit> , and degrades the streptococcal superantigen smez  <cit> . such a process might be of importance in controlling the enzymatic activity of endos or to release fragments with biological activity, but at this point we could only substantiate the former. interestingly, a recent study has shown in a mouse model of subcutaneous infection that s. pyogenes undergoes a stable phase shift to low speb production leading to production of intact forms of several putative and known virulence factors including endos  <cit> . this further emphasizes the role for speb in controlling the activity of other secreted and cell wall-anchored proteins during the infection process.

attempts to recombinantly express the amino- and carboxy-terminal parts of endos separately for functional studies have this far proven unsuccessful. the amino-terminal part could be expressed in e. coli, but the protein is degraded despite the use of protease-deficient host strains, while the gene fragment encoding the carboxy-terminal part could not be established in e. coli for unknown reasons . furthermore, we have not been able to separate the speb generated fragments of endos using gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, or affinity chromatography with immobilized endos antibodies .

homology modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and chemical modification experiments of endos suggest that the amino-terminal part contains several key elements necessary for enzymatic activity on human igg. the function of the carboxy-terminal part remains unknown, but the observation that only full-length endos has activity on igg indicates that also this part of the protein is important for the interaction with igg, either as necessary structural element or by direct interactions with igg. the primary and possible structural similarities between endos and lrr's from other pathogenic bacteria suggest that it might have similar adhesive or invasive functions either as a liberated domain or in the intact enzyme. interestingly, another recently identified extracellular s. pyogenes lrr protein; slr  is involved in virulence and phagocytosis resistance  <cit> . our findings may in part explain why endos in contrast to many related endoglycosidases, that require or are enhanced by denaturation of the glycoprotein, only interacts with native igg  <cit> . a protein-protein interaction between the enzyme and igg involving tryptophan residues in endos could be part of this unique feature.

it is currently not known how the igg-hydrolyzing activities of speb and endos contributes to the pathogenesis of s. pyogenes infections, even though the attenuation seen in speb mutants might include loss of activity agianst igg. there are fundamental differences between the two enzymes despite their shared substrate; speb is a broad spectrum protease with activities against a whole array of host proteins while endos is very specific for igg. this might give a hint about their respeictive contribution to igg hydrolysis. speb most likely contributes to igg hydrolysis during infections but there will be many competing substrates that will lower the effeciency against igg. it should also be mentioned, that s. pyogenes possesses another cysteine proteinase, ides, that in contrast to speb only hydrolyzes igg  <cit> . endos on the other hand could at low concentrations efficeintly incapacitate igg during certain stages of the infection. our current model hypothesizes that endos most likely plays a minor role in animals without aquired immunity towards s. pyogenes and only comes into play when there are circulating antibodies towards the bacteria. we are currently setting up animal models to test this hypothesis. animals will be immunized with surface structures from s. pyogenes prior to challenge with wild type bacteria and an isogenic mutant in the ndos gene. this might help us to further elucidate the role for endos during infections.

CONCLUSIONS
the cysteine proteinase speb processes, inactivates, and ultimately degrades the igg glycan-hydrolyzing enzyme endos. glutamic acid  <dig> in endos is required for glycan-hydrolyzing activity and tryptophans in endos are involved in the enzymatic activity on human igg. this is important information for future studies of the function and presence of endos in various systems. since speb and endos are expressed during the same conditions , researchers setting out to study endos are bound to experience degradation/inactivation of endos if not the temporal production and activity of both enzymes are taken into account.
