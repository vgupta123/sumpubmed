BACKGROUND
organ-specific patterns of gene expression can give important clues about gene function and organ characteristics. high-throughput sequencing methods offer the opportunity to examine patterns of gene expression on a genome scale and generate an abundance of data describing the expression of gene transcripts within various human organs and disease states to facilitate transcriptomic studies  <cit> . organ-specificity expression profiling has been widely used for identifying potentially therapeutic genes related to specific organs  <cit>  and understanding the characteristics of cells and tissues in an organ in terms of their differential expression of genes  <cit> . for example, andrew su etc. have designed custom arrays that interrogate the expression of the vast majority of protein-encoding human and mouse genes, and have used them to profile a panel of  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse tissues or organs  <cit> . previous researches have identified organ-specific genes that are specifically expressed in the testis  <cit> , the heart  <cit> , the prostate  <cit> , the brain  <cit> , and the bladder  <cit>  etc. for example, kouame etc. identified the genes uniquely detected in each of the  <dig> tissues or organs such as testis, prostate, ovary, mammary gland, uterus, vagina, skin, liver, adipose tissue, lung, bone, skeletal muscle, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland. their study shows that  <dig> organ-specific transcripts in the testis are statistically different from the other organs and that some transcripts such as dipeptidase  <dig>  ankyrin repeat domain  <dig>  and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2n are exclusively found in the testis  <cit> . they have also identified some prostate specific genes such as microseminoprotein , seminal vesicle protein secretion  <dig>  seminal vesicle antigen  and mucin  <dig>  which are involved in protein secretion, cell signaling and spermatogenesis.

for “organ-specificity of gene expression”, we refer to differential expressions of the same gene across different organs. in particular, we define an “organ-specific gene/protein” as a gene/protein whose expression is significantly elevated in a specific human organ. however, the expression level of the organ-specific gene/protein may vary in an organ under certain circumstances, which makes the organ-specificity questionable. therefore, we need to quantify organ specificity based on organ context. highly expressed genes/proteins with high quantitative organ specificity levels are also implicated in human diseases related to the organ. in other words, they may be used as an indicator of the normal/abnormal physiological states of the organ. we refer to them as “organ-specific markers”.

the organ-specific gene/protein can be used as an indicator to measure the function of a tissue in a respective organ. the organ-specific gene/protein can indicate important clues about gene function  <cit>  and also monitor organ integrity both during preclinical toxicological assessment and clinical safety testing of investigational drugs. additionally, it may provide valuable information for decision making during toxicological assessment and may be used for sensitive and specific target organ monitoring during clinical trials  <cit> .

there are a number of databases today that include information on tissue specific expression of genes/proteins, for example, tiger  <cit> , tisged  <cit> , and hpa  <cit> . these resources have several limitations. first, they all uses organ name to present tissue. for example, brain is considered as a tissue and not an organ. tissue is a group of cells that perform specific functions. an organ is a group of tissues that perform a specific function or group of functions. also it is common to know what organ system is involved in a disease and diseases are mostly categorized by human organ system. therefore, we need to map tissues to organs and use organ name instead of tissue name for calculating organ-specificity and building the disease-organ association which is more accurate than disease-tissue relationship. second, they have a low coverage of organs and genes. for example, tiger  <cit>  covers only  <dig> organs. it includes expression values for genes and has gene id’s, but no protein information is presented.  <dig>  out of  <dig>  unigene ids have been retired since its last update in  <dig>  in tisged  <cit> ,  <dig> organs are covered. it defines tissues by organ name in a tree fashion, but all tissues in an organ are not covered and protein information is not presented. hpa   <cit>  provides a range of  <dig> tissue-specific proteins which cover  <dig> organs based on the protein levels in  <dig> normal cell types. although hpa’s normal tissue data contains  <dig> ensembl genes, their expression values are based on the annotated expression levels: “negative”, “moderate”, “strong”, “weak”, “medium”, “high”, “none”, and “low.” no real number value for expression is given, which makes digitizing the expression values very challenging and calculating organ specificity questionable. for example, how to accurately digitally distinguish between the “strong” and “high”, the “weak” and “low”, and the “moderate” and “medium?”. last, they don’t contain disease information such as disease-organ relationship and disease-gene relationship.

for studies focusing on organ-specificity with relation to diseases, it is desirable that the database should house data from a range of organs, have quantitative organ specificity and, more importantly, disease information. therefore, as described in this paper, we designed an integrated database defining human organ-specific molecule . in our organ-specific molecule design we considered five criteria: 1) comprehensive organ coverage; 2) gene/protein to disease association; 3) disease-organ association; 4) quantification of organ-specificity; and 5) cross-linking of multiple available data sources.

the human organ-specific molecular electronic repository , located at http://bio.informatics.iupui.edu/homer/ is a comprehensive database covering about  <dig>  proteins,  <dig> organs, and  <dig>  diseases integrated from databases including dbest  <cit> , tisged  <cit> , hpa  <cit> , ctd  <cit> , and disease ontology  <cit> . it is the first comprehensive database that can be used to analyze, identify, and characterize organ-specific molecules in association with disease-organ and disease-protein relationships. the gene/protein to disease and disease-organ associations allow future identification of organ-specific markers. the comprehensive  <dig> organs in  <dig> human organ systems and the ability to choose quantitative variables  provide us with power statistics and computation to accurately calculate organ specificity. and the cross-linking of multiple data sources enables subsequent validation.

the database has a web-based user interface that allows users to query organ-specific genes/proteins by gene, protein, organ, or disease, browse organ-specific genes/proteins by human organ system and disease ontology, explore a histogram of each organ-specific gene/protein, and identify disease-related genes or disease-related organs.

moreover, two case studies were performed to demonstrate and validate that the repository can help researchers discover and characterize organ-specific protein molecules implicated in human diseases related to the organ: 1) an association analysis of organ-specific genes with disease and 2) a gene set enrichment analysis of organ-specific gene expression data.

RESULTS
database content statistics
by integrating organ-specific protein/genes and disease databases including dbest  <cit> , tisged  <cit> , hpa  <cit> , ctd  <cit> , and disease ontology  <cit> , we have developed homer, the human organ-specific molecular electronic repository. as of the current release , homer contains  <dig>  proteins ,  <dig>  genes ,  <dig> organs, and  <dig>  diseases  of which  <dig> are disease-related organ-specific genes  and  <dig> are identified as organ-specific markers  . a comparison of organ-specific genes/proteins in homer against several common human tissue/organ-specific data sources is shown in table  <dig> 

rz ≥ 4
ae ≥ 10
* <dig> gene ids were filtered out from  <dig>   <dig> human unigene ids with tissuespecificityindex =  <dig>  we used tissuespecificityindex =  <dig> as the website didn’t recommend any criteria for us to derive organ-specific genes.

**  <dig> of  <dig> unigene ids were retired.

***  <dig> gene ids were filtered out from  <dig> gene ids with spm ≥  <dig> . we used spm ≥  <dig>  as the website didn’t recommend any criteria for us to derive organ-specific genes.

general online features
in figure  <dig>  we show the user interfaces of the web-based online version of homer. it supports both standard and customized search options that allow users to specify a list of genes/proteins or keywords as the query input. in the advanced search interface, users can drill down in very specific ways, including referencing a list of genes/proteins, searching within p-value, z-score, number of est, and adjusted number of est ranges, and looking for organ-specific genes/proteins related to specific organs, disease mesh ids, or dbest library ids. one of the more interesting features of homer is the ability to browse for organ-specific genes/proteins by human organ system and disease ontology.

in response to these queries, homer can retrieve a list of related organ-specific genes in a highly flexible table, with which users can further explore details about organ-specific genes/proteins. for example, users can browse gene symbol, p-value and z-score for each gene/protein, explore the organ-specific expressions of the hmid by clicking on the histogram icon in the table, and look through the gene-related diseases and disease-related organs by clicking on the disease relevance icon in the last column. in the histogram, users can browse the dbest libraries and reference sources which contain the ests related to the gene/protein. the organ-specific genes/proteins are freely available for downloading in tab-delimited format on the download page. user queried organ-specific gene/protein data stored in homer can also be freely downloaded as tab-delimited text files using links below each organ-specific gene/protein table.

overlap of osgs among organs
we used a heatmap to show the overlap of osgs among the  <dig> organs . the  <dig> organs which show more than  <dig> organ-specific genes are testis ; blood vessel ; and brain , while gallbladder , spinal cord , peritoneum , and ureter  have the least number of organ-specific genes in our study.

when we tightened the criteria from rz ≥  <dig> to rz ≥  <dig>  we found that there is no overlapping among the  <dig> organs. we also found that the distribution of organ specificity of genes between the  <dig> organs marginally changes with the increase in relative z-score. this suggests that those top organs with more organ-specific genes are much more organ-specific than the other organs.

validation by hpa
selecting the top three genes from each organ, we found  <dig> organ-specific genes in unigeneids . based on expert experience, we digitalized the annotated protein expression in hpa. on a scale of  <dig> to  <dig>  ‘none’  <dig>  ‘negative’ is  <dig>  ‘low’  <dig>  ‘weak’  <dig>  ‘medium’  <dig>  ‘moderate’  <dig>  ‘high’  <dig>  and ‘strong’  <dig>  after scoring the annotated protein expression, we used the similar statistics method for the dbest data to calculate the p-value and z-score for hpa and found  <dig>  out of the overlapping  <dig> organ-specific genes in homer are specific to the same organ in hpa data .

pathway analysis, gene ontology categorization, and drug target analysis of organ-specific genes/proteins
the pathway-gene association matrix for the  <dig> organ-specific genes is shown in the additional file  <dig>  the top two pathways are “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction” and “ribosome.”  <dig> disease/cancer-related pathways are included in the additional file  <dig>  which are "pathways in cancer," "jak-stat signaling pathway," "autoimmune thyroid disease," "ppar signaling pathway," "chemokine signaling pathway," "p <dig> signaling pathway," "type i diabetes mellitus," "alzheimer's disease," "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ," "huntington's disease," "vibrio cholerae infection," "epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection," "small cell lung cancer," "allograft rejection," and "graft-versus-host disease."

in the additional file  <dig>  we list all drugs with which those  <dig> organ-specific genes interact as drug targets. interestingly, we found some organ-specific drug targets are involved in a particular metabolic or signaling pathway that is specific to the organs as key molecules. for example, the two brain-specific biomarkers sv2a and grm <dig> are used as drug targets of levetiracetam, and nicotine and acamprosate, respectively, which is consistent with previous findings. pediatr etc. studied  <dig> patients with cancer and seizures treated with levetiracetam, and they observed that over 95% of patients had fewer seizures, with  <dig> % becoming seizure free; only one patient experienced an adverse reaction. they concluded that levetiracetam is effective and well tolerated in children with brain tumors and other cancers, who are often on multiple enzyme-inducing drugs  <cit> .

one study shows that nicotine can help improve some of the learning and memory problems associated with hypothyroidism. such studies suggest that nicotine -- or drugs that mimic nicotine -- may one day prove beneficial in the treatment of neurological disorders  <cit> . another new study has found that one of nicotine's metabolites, cotinine, may improve memory and protect brain cells from diseases such as alzheimer's and parkinson's  <cit> .

acamprosate, also known by the brand name campral, is a drug used for treating alcohol dependence. acamprosate is thought to stabilize the chemical balance in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcoholism, possibly by blocking glutaminergic n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, while gamma-aminobutyric acid type a receptors are activated  <cit> .

case studies
it has been reported that organ-specific genes are often implicated in diseases related to specific organs. however, it remains largely unknown whether there is a correlation between the organ specificity of a gene/protein and the diseases associated with the organ. we show two case studies of increasing complexity and biological significance to achieve three goals: 1) to demonstrate that the database can help researchers discover and characterize organ-specific genes/proteins from experimental data, 2) to test the hypothesis that there is correlation between the organ specificity of a gene/protein and the associated diseases, and 3) thereby to validate the usefulness of our database.

case study 1: website features
the liver is the human body’s one of most important organs, functioning as a living filter to clean the system of toxins, metabolize proteins, control hormonal balance, and produce immune-boosting factors. in this case study, we illustrate the features of homer by testing the association between liver-specific genes/proteins and the liver diseases.

we first investigated the liver-specific gene/protein by querying organ by liver . we obtained  <dig> liver-specific genes . these proteins include major plasma proteins such as alb, factors in hemostasis and fibrinolysis such as plg, carrier proteins such as serpina <dig>  hormones such as igf <dig>  prohormones such as agt and serpina <dig>  and apolipoproteins such as apoa <dig>  this number of proteins may suggest that the proteins which are produced in the liver and secreted into the blood have a high percentage of secretion in liver-specific genes.

we further investigated the disease status of the  <dig> liver-specific genes by querying for diseases of the liver . we found that  <dig>  out of the  <dig> liver-specific genes are associated with liver-related diseases. for example, those liver-related diseases include mesh:d <dig> , mesh:d <dig>  mesh:d <dig> , mesh:d <dig> , mesh:d <dig> , and mesh:d <dig> .  <dig>  out of the  <dig> are validated as directly related to the liver by disease ontology  <cit> . we, therefore, concluded that liver-specific genes/proteins identified by homer are more likely to be associated with diseases related to the liver. in the future, we will test whether this conclusion can be applied to the other organs.

case study 2: organ-specific gene set enrichment analysis
we downloaded microarray data from geo  <cit>  for six organs: lung, ovary, prostate, bladder, pancreas, and kidney . we then created a phenotype table of normal and disease states for each reference series. next, we built  <dig> organ-specific gene sets  and  <dig> random non-specific gene sets using the organ-specific gene set enrichment analysis method explained in the method section.

after preparing the three data files -- expression datasets, phenotype labels, and gene sets-- we loaded them into r-gsea, set the analysis parameters, and ran the analysis for every reference series. for example, the gsea results for gse <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  the genome-wide gene expression profiles in gse <dig> were compared in tissues derived from subjects with active pulmonary sarcoidosis  and those with normal lung anatomy . its original purpose was to test the hypothesis that tissue genome-wide gene expression analysis, coupled with gene network analyses of differentially expressed genes, would provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary sarcoidosis  <cit> .

for the lung-specific gene set, five key statistics for the gene set enrichment analysis were reported, enrichment score  , normalized enrichment score , familywise-error rate , false discovery rate , and nominal p value. the normalized enrichment score  is the primary statistic for examining gene set enrichment results  <cit> . by normalizing the enrichment score, gsea accounts for differences in gene set size and in correlations between gene sets and the expression dataset; therefore, we used the normalized enrichment scores  to compare analysis results across organ-specific gene sets and non-organ-specific gene sets.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed homer as an integrated database system to query, analyze, and characterize organ-specific genes/proteins. homer integrates many different types of organ-specific molecular information: organ-specific genes/proteins from the dbest  <cit> , tisged  <cit> , and hpa  <cit>  databases; disease gene relationship from the ctd  <cit>  database; and disease organ relationships from the disease ontology  <cit>  database. organ-specific genes/proteins can be searched, displayed, and downloaded from our online user interface. the current homer database can help users address a wide range of organ specificity related questions in human disease studies. we also developed a statistical method for organ-specific genes/proteins, which can be extended to other organisms. last, our database was evaluated by comparison to other known databases and two case studies.

discussion
in this paper, we have demonstrated that homer can be used to discover and characterize organ-specific genes/proteins from experimental data and to test the hypothesis that there is correlation between the organ specificity of a gene/protein and the associated diseases. in case study  <dig>  we showed that liver-specific genes/proteins identified by homer are more likely to be associated with diseases related to the liver. and in case study  <dig>  we showed that organ-specific gene sets are more likely to become enriched in disease samples in the lung, ovary, bladder, pancreas, and kidney, but not in the prostate. it is obvious that more data and analysis, validation methods and tools, and clinical trials are needed to translate organ-specific biomarkers to clinical applications. with ongoing efforts and as more disease and microarray data are collected, homer can become a useful resource to investigate the relationship between organ specificity and organ-related disease.

in biology, an organ is a group of tissues that perform a specific function or group of functions. there are  <dig> primary tissue types in the human body: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscle tissue and nerve tissue. and there are  <dig> major organ systems in the human body: circulatory system, lymphatic system, digestive system, endocrine system, integumentary system, muscular system, nervous system, reproductive system, respiratory system, skeletal system, urinary/excretory systems, and embryonic system. usually there is a main tissue and sporadic tissues in an organ. for example, the heart is mostly composed of fibroblasts and to some extent of cardiomyoc <cit> . based on the main tissue and the human organ system, we categorized the tissues in dbest into organs. we found some tissues difficult to categorize in this way, for example, adipose tissue, peritoneum and leiomios . since there are too many libraries of those tissues in the dbest, we decided to categorize them into separate organs with the same name of the tissues.

adipose tissue and peritoneum don't really belong to any organ system. adipose tissue is more commonly known as fat, and it helps cushion the skin and provide protection from cold temperatures. all the peritoneum really does is lubricate and drain the abdomen. a leiomyoma  is a benign smooth muscle neoplasm that is not premalignant. it can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel and the esophagus. in the dbest, there are  <dig> libraries which list leiomios, an uncharacterized tissue, as an organ, for example in lib. <dig> .

there are also several potential limitations to this study. first, some libraries in dbest are not labeled clearly for tissues or organs. for example, in lib. <dig> to lib. <dig>  we cannot get any information about tissues or organs. second, there are  <dig> libraries in dbest which are mixed, such as lib. <dig>  which pools human melanocyte, fetal heart, and pregnant uterus. we removed these before data analysis. the last possible limitation to the study relates to the relatively small or even absence of microarray sample numbers in some organs. for example, most organs have only  <dig> to  <dig> reference series which contain normal and disease states, and there is no microarray data with both normal and disease states for amnion, blood vessel, bone, ear, embryo, gallbladder, ganglia, leiomios, rectum, salivary gland, spinal cord, spleen, thymus, tonsil, trachea, umbilical cord, and ureter. however, with the ongoing development of homer and geo  <cit> , more microarray data will become available and be collected, and more organ-specific genes/proteins may be validated.
