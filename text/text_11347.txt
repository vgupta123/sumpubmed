BACKGROUND
self-incompatibility  is the most widespread and important mating system that promotes outcrossing while prevents inbreeding. many flowering plants have si system  <cit> , which can be classified into two types: gametophytic si  and sporophytic si . the incompatibility phenotype of pollen is determined by its own haploid genotype in gsi, whereas it is determined by the diploid genotype of the parent plants in ssi  <cit> . the brassicaceae is considered as a hotspot of ssi, which uses the pistil-expressed receptor kinase to recognize self/non-self-pollen  <cit>  and is controlled by a multi-allelic s locus  <cit> . s alleles have high amino acid sequence divergence within species . s-locus receptor kinase  was identified as the female determinant  <cit> . s-locus cysteine-rich  proteins were identified as the male determinants in the brassicaceae  <cit> . binding of scr to srk induces autophosphorylation of srk, which triggers a signaling cascade leading to the si response. arm repeat containing  <dig>  and m-locus protein kinase  are two signaling molecules that positively mediate signal transduction. arc <dig> is expressed in the stigma and interacts with srk through its cytoplasmic domain  <cit> . mlpk was identified in a recessive mutant of brassica rapa var. yellow sarson. mutation of the gene leads to si in b. rapa yellow sarson  <cit> . other components associated with the si signaling pathway include thioredoxin-h  <dig>  and thioredoxin-h  <dig> . moreover, ca2+ is also involved in signal transduction of si. in citrus clementine, several novel genes that potentially regulate ca2+ homeostasis were identified during self-pollen recognition  <cit> .

genetic studies of si in the asteraceae started with species such as crepis foetida, parthenium argentium and cosmos bipinnatus in the 1950s. over 60 % of species in the asteraceae are estimated to use ssi for genetic determination. first studies in these plants identified the ssi system in the asteraceae and showed that the si is controlled by the s locus  <cit> . however, the precise number of srk genes required for pollen specificity and the male and female determinants underlying ssi in the asteraceae remains unknown. senecio squalidus  has been used as a model plant to study the molecular mechanism of si in the asteraceae. early studies on stigma surfaces in the asteraceae indicated that the asteraceae species have dry type stigmas. later, elleman et al. performed a comparative study of pollen-stigma interactions among five different plants and showed that stigmas of asteraceae species produce a small amount of surface secretion and are not entirely dry  <cit> . this finding was subsequently confirmed by hiscock et al. in s. squalidus and other asteraceae species, which led to a reclassification of the asteraceae stigma as ‘semi-dry’  <cit> . it has been concluded that ssi in senecio species operates through a different molecular mechanism with that in brassica  <cit> . however, the s. squalidus dataset shared a greater number of homologous genes with the dry stigma species than the wet stigma species  <cit> . the number of s alleles in s. squalidus is low compared with other species that use ssi . this inference was further analyzed through different transcripts of s. squalidus and ssh was successfully used to isolate pistil-enriched transcripts from three different s-genotypes of s. squalidus.  <dig> different candidates for pistil-specific genes in s. squalidus were identified  <cit> . several new genes, such as membrane associated protein , sunflower- <dig>  and nodulin/mtn <dig> gene , might be linked with si in s.squalidus. the senecio pistil-specific map was found to be expressed in the papillar cells and transmitting tissue of the stigma  <cit> . in s. squalidus, the nucleotide sequence of map exhibits relatively high s-genotypic polymorphism, which is elevated in the extracellular region  <cit> . the sf <dig> gene family was also isolated from s. squalidus. there are differences in these gene copies and expressed patterns  <cit> . nod is expressed exclusively in the papillar cells of the s. squalidus stigma, where it appears to be developmentally regulated, reaching maximal expression as the stigmatic lobes reflex to expose the papillar cells  <cit> .

erigeron breviscapus  hand.-mazz, an important chinese traditional medicinal plant  <cit> , is a self-incompatible species of asteraceae. it has been used to treat cerebrovascular and cardiovascular problems  <cit> . recently, accumulating studies on e. breviscapus have been focused on chemical components  <cit> , pharmacological activities , and germplasm resources . however, little is known about the genetic mechanisms of si responses in e. breviscapus.rna sequencing is a powerful tool to investigate the molecular biology of many angiosperm and it has been used successfully for si in lemon and leymus chinensis  <cit> . to uncover critical genes associated with si responses, we compared the gene expression profiles in capitulum of e. breviscapus during non-, self- and cross-pollination, using transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly. after analysis, a larger number of potential si candidate genes showing differential expression were uncovered, including genes functioning in cell-cell communication, signal transduction and the pollination process, such as mlpk, arc <dig>  cam, exo70a <dig>  map, sf <dig> and nod. our study thus provides a pool of si-related genes in e. breviscapus and offers a valuable resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms of si responses in asteraceae.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly of e. breviscapus transcriptome
three pools  capitulum of mrna samples were used to build libraries for high-throughput sequencing using illumina sequencing technology. the illumina hiseq  <dig> next-generation sequencing generated  <dig>  m raw reads comprising  <dig>  gb from the three libraries, with a q <dig> percentage  above 82 %. the reads that only had 3′-adaptor fragments were removed from the raw reads, resulting in  <dig>  m clean reads comprising  <dig>  gb with a q <dig> above 94 % . the filtered reads were de novo assembled by trinity . the assembly results revealed that the transcriptome of e. breviscapus consists of  <dig>  unigenes. the mean length of these unigenes was 882 bp and the n <dig> value was 1485 bp. the size distribution of the unigenes was shown in fig.  <dig>  the coding regions of each sequence were predicted by getorf, which predicted  <dig>  open reading frames  from our assembled transcriptome, with  <dig>   orfs longer than 300 bp. the mean length of these orfs was 554 bp and the n <dig> value was 1167 bp. the size distribution of the unigenes is shown in fig.  <dig>  the high-quality reads produced in this study have been deposited in the ncbi sra database .table  <dig> quality of sequencing

functional annotation and classification
annotation of the assembled unigenes was based on searches of specific databases for sequence similarity. all of the unigenes were compared with sequences in the nr database, the swiss-prot protein database, the kegg database and the cog database, using blastx with a cutoff e-value of 10− <dig>  a total of  <dig>  unigenes  returned a significant blast result . among them,  <dig>  unigenes  showed high similarity to sequences in the nr database. the numbers of unigenes with significant similarity to sequences in the cog, kegg and swiss-prot databases were  <dig>  ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  , respectively .table  <dig> summary of the annotation of unigenes of e. breviscapus




go classification of the  <dig>  annotated unigenes classified them into the functional categories: cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes. among the various cellular components , cell, cell part and organelle were the most highly represented. genes involved in other important cellular components, such as organelle parts, membrane, macromolecular complexes, extracellular regions, cell junction and membrane-enclosed lumen, were also identified through go annotations. similarly, binding and catalytic activities were most represented among various molecular functions; metabolic process and cellular process were most represented in the biological process categories .fig.  <dig> gene ontology classification of assembled unigenes. the  <dig>  matched unigenes were classified into three functional categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component



cog is a database built on phylogenetic relationships of protein sequences from  <dig> genomes, including bacteria, plants and animals. individual proteins or paralogs from at least three lineages are categorized in each cog to represent an ancient conserved domain. within the e. breviscapus unigenes dataset,  <dig>  were categorized  into  <dig> functional cog clusters . the five largest categories were: 1) general function prediction only; 2) replication, recombination and repair; 3) transcription; 4) signal transduction mechanisms; and 5) post-translational modification, protein turnover and chaperones.fig.  <dig> cog functional classification of all unigenes sequences.  <dig>   unigenes showed significant similarity to sequences in the cog databases and were clustered into  <dig> categories



gene expression differences in the three libraries
gene expression level was calculated using the rpkm method, which takes the influence of both the sequencing depth and gene length on read count into account. on the basis of the applied criteria ,  <dig> genes were identified as significantly differentially expression genes  between sample t <dig>  and t <dig> , in which  <dig> were upregulated genes and  <dig> were downregulated in the e. breviscapus transcriptome. in addition,  <dig> genes were identified as significant degs between samples t <dig> and t <dig> , and  <dig> genes were identified as significant degs between samples t <dig> and t <dig>  for these degs, go and kegg analyses were performed.

between samples t <dig> and t <dig>   <dig> degs were associated with  <dig> subcategories, which were grouped into three major categories: biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. in each of the three major categories of the go classification, ‘metabolic process’, ‘cell part’ and ‘catalytic activity’ terms were dominant . to further investigate the biochemical pathways of these degs, we mapped all degs to terms in the kegg database. of the  <dig> degs,  <dig> genes had a ko id and could be categorized into  <dig> pathways. of those, two pathways were significantly enriched : genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction and starch and source metabolism being the most significantly enriched . between samples t <dig> and t <dig>  the expression levels of  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated;  <dig> of these degs were associated with  <dig> sub-categories, and  <dig> were mapped to  <dig> pathways . between samples t <dig> and t <dig>  the expression levels of  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated;  <dig> of these degs were associated with  <dig> sub-categories, and  <dig> were mapped to  <dig> pathways .fig.  <dig> gene ontology classification of differentially expressed genes between samples

comparison of transcriptional profiles of genes associated with si responses among the three libraries
previous researches demonstrated that a number of genes involved in si responses are differentially expressed, such as genes for cell-cell communication and signal transduction. to uncover genes involved in si responses in e. breviscapus, the relative expression levels of si-associated genes were analyzed in detail and the results demonstrated that most of their unigenes showed significant changes in expression levels in the three libraries. those genes associated with si were clustered according to similarities in expression profiles between self- and cross-pollination. a heat map of gene expression of  <dig> putative genes involved in si by pheatmap software is shown in fig.  <dig>  variance-stabilized data obtained using the deseq package was used to generate the heat map by pheatmap software. the rna-seq analysis of transcriptional data revealed that some genes  were highly expressed in self-pollinated capitulum but poorly expressed in cross-pollinated ones. in contrast, thl and cam were downregulated after self-pollination but upregulated after cross-pollination. however, exo70a <dig> showed no difference among three cdna libraries. these genes will be further examined to investigate their biological functions. the rpkm value of partial unigenes involved in si responses were listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> fig.  <dig>

identification and expression analysis of candidate genes involved in si responses
a putative srk-like gene, ebsrlk  <dig> , was cloned. phylogenetic analysis was performed by alignment using entire predicted protein sequences from e. breviscapus and other species by mega software. the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree demonstrated that cl21813contig <dig>  is most closely related to srk from s. squalidus l., but is distant from the srk of crucifer species  . calcium ions are able to transmit diverse signals that exert primary actions on cells. calmodulin , as the multifunctional calcium receptor, is associated with various physiological and developmental processes in plants. the rnaseq results showed that the expression levels of cl21813contig <dig>  and t3_unigene_bmk. <dig>  were upregulated after self-pollination. the highest expression levels were observed at  <dig> and 10 h after self-pollination for ebsrlk <dig> and ebsrlk <dig>  respectively. however, their expression levels were lower in cross-pollinated capitulum than in self-pollinated capitulum. the highest expression levels for ebsrlk <dig> and ebsrlk <dig> in cross-pollinated capitulum were observed at  <dig> and 48 h after pollination, respectively. cl4907contig <dig>  was downregulated after self-pollination and upregulated after cross-pollination. the expression levels of the three genes were significantly different between self- and cross-pollination . furthermore, the expressions of the three genes were significantly different at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after self- and cross-pollination . to confirm the results of rnaseq, three candidate si-associated genes  were chosen for further expression analysis. using gene-specific primer pairs, the expression levels of the candidate genes were analyzed at different time points after self- or cross-pollination by using qrt-pcr . the expression patterns of these three genes in the qrt-pcr analysis showed the similar trend as the rnaseq analysis .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of cl21813contig <dig> from e. breviscapus with other srks from different species. the neighbor-joining tree based on p-distance and pairwise deletions of gaps indicates the phylogenetic relationships among the putative srk proteins in different species. the numbers at the branching points indicate the bootstrap support values . the putative e. breviscapus s locus receptor protein kinase is marked with a triangular symbol

discussion
to identify genes involved in the si, we sequenced the e. breviscapus transcriptome and de novo assembled reads from next-generation rna-seq data. we identified  <dig>  unigenes in the three libraries . in the absence of e. breviscapus genomic information, the availability of the transcriptome data will provide a valuable resource to investigate the mechanisms of si responses.

genes involved in si responses in e. breviscapus
the s-locus encodes two proteins: srk and scr. srk encodes an s receptor kinase  <cit> . e. breviscapus exhibits an ssi system of si as other asteraceae species. s alleles have high amino acid sequence divergence within species, and e. breviscapus is no exception: the pistil srlk genes from the transcriptome showed sequence divergence. phylogenetic analysis of these unigenes with other srks from different species demonstrated that the characteristics of some srks  in e. breviscapus are not consistent with other srk genes . the rna-seq analysis of transcriptional data revealed the same expression pattern . previous studies of s. squalidus have shown that orthologues of the brassica s-gene, srk, are not expressed exclusively in the stigma, or linked to the s-locus  <cit> . in the three samples, differentially expressed, putative ebsrlk genes were identified. one putative ebsrlk <dig> gene  was cloned. quantitative pcr analysis revealed that ebsrlk <dig> was highly expressed in self-pollinated capitulum and poorly expressed in cross-pollinated ones . however, their expression patterns suggested that they are unlikely to be directly involved in si and which may be similar to the srk-like genes in s. squalidus. further studies are needed to dissect the functions of these srk-like genes in e. breviscapus.

in contrast to the female factor srks, the male s-determinant scr acts as a ligand  <cit> . the hv region in the s-domain of srks acts as the scr-binding site, which involves a two-stage recognition process  <cit> . in the three libraries of e. breviscapus, only two unigenes were annotated as scr, cl18556contig <dig> and cl4799contig <dig> . functional analysis of the role of scrs in e. breviscapus during pollen-pistil interaction will be performed in a future study.

signaling pathway for the si reaction
the e. breviscapus dataset revealed many genes that play primary roles in the recognition between the stigma and pollen grains. among the identified genes, we focused on those genes encoding map, sf <dig>  nodulin <dig>  arc <dig>  mlpk, exo70a <dig>  cam and thl1/thl <dig> 

arc <dig> and mlpk are candidate downstream effectors of srk. therefore, arc <dig> might be a positive effector in the si response in brassica. antisense suppression of arc <dig> led to partial breakdown of the si response  <cit> . in the three samples in this study, only one arc <dig> transcript was found . the absence of other acr <dig> genes suggest that the assemblies were incomplete and/or that expression of the acr <dig> genes is too low to acquire enough reads to be assembled. mlpk can interact with the kinase domain of srk  <cit> . mplk is thought to function in srk-mediated signaling. in the present study, we found that the mlpk gene was upregulated in the self-pollinated and downregulated in cross-pollinated sample .

as a factor interacting with arc <dig>  exo70a <dig> has been isolated in b. napus  <cit> . overexpression of exo70a <dig> in self-incompatible b. napus partially breaks down si, whereas suppression of exo70a <dig>  in self-compatible b. napus and a. thaliana inhibited pollen adhesion, hydration and germination  <cit> . six unigenes encoding exo70a <dig> were identified in our study, although no differences in their expressions were observed among three cdna libraries . further studies are required to clarify the function of exo70a <dig> genes in e. breviscapus.

thl <dig> and thl <dig> were identified as srk-binding partners from a yeast two-hybrid screen  <cit>  and which act as negative regulators in srk signaling  <cit> . studies on the brassicaceae showed that thl plays a key role in si response. in the three cdna libraries of e. breviscapus, one striking finding was the identification of  <dig> putative thl proteins . functional analysis will be necessary to shed light on the role of the thl1/thl <dig> during signal transduction in e. breviscapus.

calmodulin is an important second messenger in many signal transduction pathways and an important calcium-banding protein. cl4907contig <dig>  was downregulated after self-pollination and upregulated after cross-pollination . quantitative pcr analysis showed that the expression pattern of the ebcam gene was the same as in the rna-seq analysis .

some new si candidate genes, map, sf <dig>  nod, were identified based on the fact that they specifically express in pistils of s. squalidus. the nucleotide sequence of map exhibits relatively high s-genotypic polymorphism  <cit> . in the three samples in e. breviscapus, few map transcript was found. the reason for the deletion of map gene may be similar to arc <dig> gene, i.e., the assemblies were incomplete and/or that expression of the map genes is too low to acquire enough reads to be assembled . phylogenetic analysis of sf <dig> nucleotide sequence alignments indicate that this gene family is conserved and may play an important role in reproductive processes in flowering plants. in e. breviscapus transcriptome dataset, we found that the sf <dig> genes were upregulated in the self-pollinated and cross-pollinated sample . nod gene family has been investigated in arabidopsis and rice, which have a crucial function in pollen development  <cit> . despite the large number of pistil-specific nodulin/mtn <dig> genes have been investigated, the function of these genes in pistils has not been studied. ten unigenes encoding nod were identified in our study, they were also upregulated in the self-pollinated and cross-pollinated sample . sf <dig> and nod might well be involved in si, however, further studies are needed.

moreover, there were many other genes that might be involved in si in the three libraries of e. breviscapus, such as snx <dig>  kapp and annexin . further studies are required to fully understand the role and mechanism of these candidate genes in si.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed the first large-scale investigation of gene expression in the capitulum of e. breviscapus, an asteraceae ssi species, using high-throughput rna-seq analysis. after assembly,  <dig>  gene models were obtained , among which  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated by comparing them with four public databases .  <dig>  unigenes  showed high similarity with sequences in the nr database. degs were identified among the three cdna libraries . approximately  <dig> genes showed differential expression that might be associated with si. quantitative pcr confirmed the expression patterns of selected genes examined by rna-seq. most of the genes identified by the rna-seq analysis were not previously reported or studied in e. breviscapus. although function information is missing, we hypothesized that mlpk, arc <dig>  cam, exo70a <dig>  map, sf <dig> and nod might be crucial for the si responses in e. breviscapus. however, ebsrlk <dig> and ebsrlk <dig> genes were found not closely related to si in e. breviscapus and they are more like the srk-like genes. the results will lead to a better understanding of the ssi system in the asteraceae. the functions of these genes will provide clues to the mechanisms that underlie si in e. breviscapus ssi systems.
