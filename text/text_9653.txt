BACKGROUND
two rounds of genome duplication  have now been clearly established to have occurred in early vertebrate evolution  <cit> , with a further round taking place in teleost ancestry   <cit> . extra independent genome duplications have been determined in salmonids  <cit> , and in ray-finned fish paddlefish  <cit> . these events have modeled the genomes of extant vertebrate lineages in terms of gene numbers and the overall genome architecture, contributing to the appearance of numerous innovations  <cit> . in addition to the increase in gene counts resulting from 1r/2r/3r, the comprehension and detection of gene loss processes in combination with the differential retention of paralogues poses important challenges to enlighten vertebrate evolution  <cit> .

fatty acids  are a particularly important category of lipid molecules, being a considerable source of energy and a significant component of bio-membranes. fa metabolism involves among others, processes such as hydrolysis, beta-oxidation, synthesis, esterification and activation. the later comprises a two-step, atp dependent reaction, with the formation of an intermediate acyl-amp which is then converted to acyl-coa. acyl-coa synthetases  are the key enzymes responsible for this fundamental initial step in lipid metabolism. they can act on non-polar hydrophobic fa substrates and convert them into water-soluble products , which are then integrated into metabolic pathways such as oxidation of acyl-coas to obtain atp, storage in the form of triglycerides  or use as building blocks for other lipid molecules. the human genome contains  <dig> acs genes divided into  <dig> distinct families: short-chain acs family ; medium-chain acs family ; long-chain acs family ; very long-chain acs family , bubblegum acs family  and acs-family   <cit> . this division reflects the chain length of their preferred substrate. acsl enzymes play a paramount role in humans, since fas with  <dig> to  <dig> carbons  are highly prevalent in the diet and are preferentially converted to acyl-coa by these enzymes  <cit> . further, several pathological conditions have been linked to acsl enzymes such as inadequate lipid metabolism leading to diabetes  <cit> , x-linked  <dig> mental retardation   <cit>  and cancer  <cit> . in mammals, previous studies identified five distinct acsl genes, which were further organized into two separate groups  and   <cit> . it is worth mentioning that the current acsl gene nomenclature omits the “acsl2” which was dropped since shortly after its identification it was found to be identical to acsl <dig> in human and additionally rodent “acsl2” was also renamed acsl <dig> since it shared more identity with human acsl <dig> <cit> . the advent of whole genome sequencing projects allowed the identification of acsl genes in non-mammalian species, but no approach has been made in order to unravel the evolutionary history of this family  <cit> . additionally, recent findings have illustrated the need to consider genome duplication processes  in combination with extensive species analysis for proper evolutionary insights regarding lipid metabolic gene networks to be drawn  <cit> . moreover, non-mammalian species, such as the zebrafish, have been recently proposed as alternative models to study lipid metabolism  <cit> . therefore, a comparative and phylogenetic approach involving a broader number of vertebrate species should shed light into the evolutionary history of acsl enzymes and their function. in this study we demonstrate that genome duplications in stem vertebrate ancestry and the teleost specific genome duplication were instrumental in the generation of acsl gene diversity. moreover, we show that the variety of acsl family members is broader than anticipated. our strategy uncovered a novel uncharacterized acsl-like gene found in teleosts and coelacanth, which we designate acsl <dig>  the detailed analysis of the acsl <dig> teleost gene locus strongly supports the suggestion that it corresponds to a retained paralogue, lost in other vertebrates classes . finally, we provide the first comparative transcription analysis between the human and zebrafish acsl gene repertoire.

RESULTS
acsl gene repertoire in vertebrates
human acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> sequences were used to perform blastp searches and collect acsl-like sequences from various available genomes. we analyzed a total of  <dig> species in order to include all major vertebrate lineages. our database search determined the presence of five acsl genes in humans, mouse, opossum, chicken, anole lizard, western clawed frog, and the coelacanth. in the spotted gar, an out-group of the teleost specific genome duplication  <cit> , we found  <dig> sequences though  <dig> were partial . blast searches in teleost fish genomes hinted at a larger acsl gene set, with nine hits in zebrafish, pufferfish, green spotted puffer and medaka and seven in stickleback. however, detailed sequence analysis suggested a number of inconsistent annotations in the ensembl database. for example, we found three acsl <dig> gene annotations in medaka, , however, when aligning the dna and amino acid sequence of the first two sequences we observe that they are identical . given that the annotated acsl <dig> copy ensorlg <dig> is located within a contig that presents extensive regions that are poorly resolved we consider that this species presents  <dig> gene copies of acsl <dig> and select ensorlg <dig> and ensorlg <dig> for further studies. the green spotted pufferfish again shows three annotated copies of acsl <dig> with two of these  located in the same scaffold with the same orientation and contiguously . these annotations are partial sequences, one corresponding to the n-terminal and the other corresponding to the c-terminal of the protein. here we assume that these annotations correspond to a single gene poorly assembled. therefore we consider that the green spotted puffer presents two acsl <dig> genes and we use only the correctly annotated gene  for further analysis. finally we find two annotated acsl <dig> genes in pufferfish  were the second gene corresponds to a partial sequence which was not used for further analysis. we investigated also the genomes of three chondrichthyans, the elephant shark, catshark, and little skate. our investigation identified  <dig> full sequences and several partial .

finally, the search in the lamprey genome resulted in four acsl-like gene hits . three of these correspond to partial sequences  and were not used for further analysis. finally, in the investigated invertebrate species, acorn worm and amphioxus, we recovered  <dig> acsl sequences from acorn worm and  <dig> acsl sequences from amphioxus. after clarifying all inconsistent gene annotations a set of acsl sequences from various species were collected to perform phylogenetics .

phylogenetics indicates vertebrate specific acsl gene expansions
preliminary phylogenetic analysis confirmed that acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> form a distinct group from acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> as previously reported   <cit> . thus, we have reconstructed each phylogeny separately . in the maximum likelihood analysis figure 1a it is possible to observe that invertebrate sequences out-group four statistical well supported clades comprising acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and an unidentified acsl group. however, the exact phylogenetic relationships between each isoform are not statistically supported with the bootstrap analysis. in the bayesian analysis  we find again the invertebrate sequences out-grouping four statistically well supported vertebrate clades. the unidentified acsl group is composed of teleost, rayfin fish and coelacanth sequences. in the maximum likelihood analysis a lamprey sequence also groups with this novel clade . we name this new gene lineage acsl <dig>  the overall tree branching pattern in maximum likelihood and bayesian analysis is indicative that the expansion of acsl1/5/6/novel clade took place after the radiation of the vertebrate lineage approximately  <dig> million years ago, although independent gene expansions have taken place in amphioxus and the acorn worm . we find representatives of acsl1/5/ <dig> in all of the examined vertebrate species, with the exception of lamprey and chondrichthyans where the presence of partial sequences impedes a final conclusion regarding the full acsl gene repertoire in these lineages . nevertheless, this cannot be taken as an indication of gene loss due to the poor genome sequence coverage. the phylogenetic trees also indicate that acsl <dig> has specifically duplicated in the teleost lineage. even though only medaka, zebrafish and stickleback present these duplicates, we antecipate that pufferfish and the green spotted pufferfish probably retain these two copies.

regarding the acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> trees , both in the maximum likelihood and bayesian analysis we observe that the invertebrate acsl-like sequences again out-group two well supported groups containing vertebrates sequences. also, it is possible to recognize that all teleost species here analyzed present a lineage specific duplication of acsl <dig> . in zebrafish and cave fish we find an acsl <dig> duplicate; microsynteny analysis of this locus in zebrafish suggests that this extra gene copy is also a teleost specific 3r duplicate . however, despite extensive database search, we did not retrieve other acsl4-like sequences in other teleost species. acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> gene copies were also found in the cat shark and little skate .

the phylogenetic analysis also resolves a further inaccurate annotation in the western clawed frog. in the ensembl database two orfs are annotated as acsl <dig> genes . after observing the localization of these two sequences in the phylogenetic tree, we find that one of the annotated “acsl4” groups within the acsl <dig> clade, which is consistent with a synteny analysis. therefore we consider that the western clawed frog presents one acsl <dig> gene  and one inaccurate annotation of an acsl <dig> gene  .

in summary, the phylogenetic data indicates that the acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> have all duplicated before vertebrate radiation, with episodes of lineage specific expansion observed in studied invertebrate deuterostomes. in addition, teleost fish underwent specific duplications in acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  and possibly acsl <dig> in zebrafish and in cave fish.

genome duplications contributed to the diversity of acsl genes in vertebrates
our phylogenetic analysis clearly indicates that despite the existence of several acsl gene copies in the studied invertebrate deuterostome species, the expansion of the acsl1/acsl2/acsl5/acsl <dig> and of the acsl3/acsl <dig> clades took place in the vertebrate ancestor. thus, we next analyzed the contribution of 2r and 3r in the generation of acsl gene diversity. we started by examining the genomic location of each human acsl gene and respective flanking gene families . human acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> localize respectively to chr4q <dig>  ch10q <dig>  and ch5q <dig> , regions which are part of the 2r nk-paralogon  <cit> . the analysis of the flanking gene families revealed that those which are multi-copy and whose duplication timing coincides with vertebrate emergence, typically have their members localizing to hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and/or hsa <dig>  for example, tcf7l <dig> gene which flanks acsl <dig> has two other duplicates mapping to hsa <dig>  and hsa <dig> ; casp <dig> which maps close to acsl <dig> has a paralogue, casp <dig>  mapping close to acsl5; pdlim <dig> mapping downstream of acsl <dig> has two paralogues, pdlim <dig> and pdlim <dig>  localizing to hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> respectively. overall, the majority of genes flanking human acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> revealed conserved macrosynteny and therefore support the hypothesis that these regions are related, with the duplication timing coinciding with 2r. furthermore, using the proposed vertebrate ancestral genome reconstruction  <cit> , we find that the hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> belong to the same ancestral group, group c . in summary, from a single ancestral chromosome c in the vertebrate ancestor, derived four chromosomes   <cit>  as a result of 1r/2r. each human acsl locus maps to a distinct ancestral c chromosome: acsl1-c <dig>  acsl6-c <dig> and acsl5-c <dig> . we would expect to find a fourth acsl gene which should map to the ancestral chromosome c <dig> distributed in present day human genome at hsa2/7/ <dig> .

regarding human acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> genes we find that they map to chromosomes chr2q <dig> and chrxq <dig> respectively. neighboring gene families have paralogues in the following set of chromosomes hsax, hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> , with no apparent conserved macrosynteny. however, acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> map to chromosome regions derived from the 2r duplication of the proto-chromosome f, at f <dig> and f <dig> respectively . accordingly, after the first round of genome duplication one f proto-chromosome underwent an additional fission event, resulting in three proto-chromosomes. two of these proto-chromosomes underwent the second wgd, giving rise to four ancestral chromosomes  and the third chromosome gave rise to the f <dig>  the gene families flanking acsl3/acsl <dig> have in most cases duplicates in regions assigned to f chromosomes  <cit> , thus providing strong support to the hypothesis that both were 2r generated.

extra gene copies of acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  and acsl <dig>  were found in our survey. the analysis of the loci of acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  in stickleback and zebrafish provides solid support to the conclusion that 3r contributed for the increase of the acsl gene set in teleosts. we find that 3r specific duplicates can be observed outflanking each pair of acsl duplicates  .

acsl <dig> is a potential 2r paralogue gone missing in tetrapods
the phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of a previously unidentified acsl gene, acsl <dig>  paralogous to acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  to enlighten the evolutionary origin of the acsl <dig> gene we analyzed the genomic locus of this novel gene in teleost species . we show that the acsl <dig> gene is confined to a largely conserved locus in teleost fish. a large set of neighboring gene families have their human orthologues mapping to hsa <dig>  the following genes egr <dig>  bin <dig>  rhobtb <dig>  bmp <dig>  pebp <dig>  stc <dig>  and ido <dig> are close together at hsa <dig> and constitute a conserved block, with ubl4b and ptchd <dig> localizing in hsa <dig> . most importantly, the conserved syntenic block in hsa <dig> maps back to the ancestral chromosome c <dig> which corresponds to the expected localization of a fourth copy of the acsl gene after 2r, absent in the human genome. further, gene families which are multicopy have their paralogues localizing to hsa10/5/ <dig> as expected. these finds together with the phylogenetic analysis suggest that the acsl <dig> gene corresponds to a retained paralogue conserved in teleosts and lost in the tetrapod lineage.

gene expression data indicates functional partitioning and diversification
given that the teleosts have additional acsl gene copies, we proceeded to analyze the gene expression of acsl genes in zebrafish and performed a comparative analysis with the human acsl gene repertoire. in zebrafish a high acsl1a mrna content is observed in all analyzed tissues with the exception of the eye , while acsl1b is only marginally expressed in testis, ovary, kidney and heart . the human acsl <dig> has a similar expression pattern with high expression in brain, heart, spleen, kidney, ovary and testis and medium to low expression in liver, lung and eye . these findings are in agreement with previous studies in rattus norvegicus in which it was found that acsl <dig> is highly expressed in major energy metabolizing tissues namely heart, liver and adipose tissues  <cit> . regarding acsl <dig>  in human we find that this enzyme is highly expressed in all tissues here analyzed with the exception of the ovary . when observing the data obtained for zebrafish we find a distinct expression pattern. high acsl <dig> mrna transcription is observed in the testis, ovary, kidney, gut and liver, while spleen, gill, heart, eye and brain have a low/absent gene transcription .

concerning acsl <dig>  in opposition to acsl <dig> and acsl5; this enzyme presents a fairly restricted expression pattern in human being highly expressed in testis, ovary and brain. in zebrafish this restricted expression pattern is also observed, with acsl <dig> being found essentially in brain . the teleost acsl <dig> transcription is high in testis, ovary, gill, heart, eye, and brain.

the expression pattern of acsl3a and acsl3b in zebrafish, reveals that acsl3a is preferably expressed in ovary, gill and brain; nevertheless this gene is also expressed at lower levels in all other tissues . acsl3b is expressed in all tissues with comparatively higher levels to acsl3a, with the exception of eye. the expression pattern of the acsl4a and acsl4b is highly similar being highly expressed in all tissues here analyzed with a slight decrease in gut and liver and low expression in eye . when observing the expression pattern of acsl <dig> in human we observe that this gene is also highly expressed in all tissues with the exception of gut and eye .

discussion
acsl are key enzymes involved in the initial steps of fa metabolism. these enzymes preferentially activate fa with c12-c <dig> , which may then intervene in a variety of metabolic pathways. although the acsl family has been the focus of various studies, their evolutionary history has not been investigated before. here we combine extensive database search with phylogenetics and comparative genomics to provide a reliable depiction of the evolution of acsl in vertebrates . initial analyses revealed several inaccurate gene annotations. after an exhaustive analysis we were able to clarify several of these and perceive that the diversity of acsl genes is broader than anticipated. the gene repertoire varies significantly between mammals , teleosts , and the invertebrate studied species . through phylogenetics we were able to reconstruct the acsl gene duplication timings in relation to the divergence of major vertebrate groups. the five mammalian acsl genes have been organized into two separate groups: acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  on the basis of sequence homology and gene organization  <cit> . we now propose that this division is evolutionarily significant and dates back to at least deuterostome ancestry since clear co-orthologues of both gene groups exist in hemichordates and cephalochordates. although, various acsl1/2/5/ <dig> genes were found in amphioxus and the acorn worm, these represent independent lineage duplications. the exact duplication timing of a proto-acsl gene to originate the ancestor of acsl1/2/5/ <dig> and acsl3/ <dig> is at present unknown but probably dates as far back as the origin of the bilateria . in the agnathan lamprey we were only able to retrieve one complete acsl sequence, although several partial sequences were also evident. thus, at this stage a final conclusion concerning the full repertoire of acsl genes in lamprey is premature. the findings that the acsl gene family expanded significantly in the time window coincident with the emergence of vertebrates lead us to test the contribution of genome duplications. using the proposed ancestral vertebrate genome reconstruction  <cit>  we were able to trace back the duplication history of acsl genes in the gnathostome ancestor. we find that human acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  map to chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> respectively which originated from duplication of the ancestral proto-chromosome c . this observation is also supported by the duplication history analysis of the flanking gene families. in teleosts we found extra gene copies within the acsl1/5/ <dig> clade. these were partially explained by the contribution of the teleost specific genome duplication  , but not entirely. a novel gene with no clear orthologues in tetrapods was found in the analyzed teleost species, the spotted gar, coelacanth and possibly lamprey. the phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated that this represents a distinct gene lineage which we name acsl <dig>  to enlighten the origin of acsl <dig>  we investigated the genomic locus in teleosts and cross-compared it with the human genome. we find that the most parsimonious explanation for the retrieved data is that acsl <dig> is a 2r paralogue retained in teleosts and lost in tetrapods, similar to what was found in a distinct acs gene family  <cit> . thus, the novel uncharacterized acsl <dig> gene corresponds to a quadruplicate acsl paraloguous to acsl <dig>  acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> 

similarly, we found also that the human orthologues of acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> map to chromosome regions related by duplication. both genes map to genomic regions remnants of 2r resulting from the duplication of the ancestral proto-chromosome f. the most plausible explanation for the unequal distribution of acsl gene copies within f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  is a chromosome fission event occurred after 1r of wgd which resulted in the splitting of the genetic information into two distinct chromosomes, which then underwent the second genome duplication  and originated f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> . the detailed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis again highlighted the contribution of 3r to the gene number increment observed in teleosts .

it has been previously suggested that major vertebrate innovations occurred after genome duplication events  <cit> . whole genome duplications lead to the expansion of gene numbers, facilitating gene diversification, sub-functionalization along with the rise of novel functions and gene loss. these ultimately enable evolutionary radiation. fa composition and metabolism is known to be different in some vertebrate groups, for example in teleosts  <cit> . similar to our findings in acsl, recent studies have also revealed that various gene families involved in lipid metabolic pathways have evolved distinct gene repertoires in vertebrate lineages, including fish, with clear functional and regulatory impacts  <cit> . the retention of such a larger acsl gene set after 2r/3r, with simultaneous processes of differential loss, could be indicative that novel acsl gene functions have emerged in vertebrate ancestry. in effect, the variety of acsls in mammals is apparently associated with distinct substrate preferences. acsl <dig> uses fa with c <dig> to c <dig> both saturated and mono unsaturated, acsl <dig> displays a high activity with c12: <dig> , c14: <dig> , c20: <dig>  and c20: <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, acsl <dig> presents a clear preference for polyunsaturated fa with c2o: <dig> and c20: <dig>  <cit> . acsl <dig> shows substrate specificity similar to acsl <dig>  favorably utilizing palmitic , palmitoleic , oleic  and linoleic  acids  <cit> . finally, acsl <dig> preferentially uses fas with c <dig> to c <dig> saturated and polyunsaturated, although alternative splicing generates isoforms with distinct substrate specificities  <cit> . we propose that teleost orthologues have probably retained similar fa substrate preferences with respect to acsls. however, novel acsl family members were also discovered in this study. thus, we performed a comparative tissue transcription analysis between zebrafish and human. we selected zebrafish as a model, given that this species has been previously suggested as a model organism for the study of lipid metabolism  <cit> , and coincidentally this species also presents the largest set of acsl genes. the comparison of the expression data between human and zebrafish revealed a similar expression profile, with the exception of acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  and the fish specific duplicates . we observe that the zebrafish acsl <dig> is expressed in fewer tissues when compared to the human orthologue, with the teleost acsl <dig> apparently compensating the lack of acsl <dig> transcription in various tissues. this setting suggests that in teleost fish functions are shared between acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  regarding the 3r duplicated members acsl3a and acsl3b, and acsl4a and acsl4b we find similar tissue expression distributions in opposition to acsl1a and acsl1b. in the latter acsl1b is co-expressed with acsl1a in a small set of specific tissues . we hypothesize that acsl1b plays a specific role in these tissues, distinct from the role played by acsl1a, hinting towards a sub-functionalization after duplication. although, we have not tested the fa specificity of the novel acsl repertoire described in this work, we cannot ignore that the retention of a larger acsl gene number in teleosts could also be related with the specific acquisition of novel substrate preferences, which future studies should address.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrate the importance of genome duplications, 2r and 3r, in the generation of the acsl diversity in vertebrate species.
