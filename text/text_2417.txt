BACKGROUND
spores of bacillus anthracis have for long been regarded as one of the most powerful bioterrorism threats due to their stability and high lethality  <cit> . the spores can be easily produced and stockpiled in large quantities, using simple microbial techniques by people having access to a virulent strain and incentive to be exposed to the risk connected with its propagation and handling. previous deliberate spread of anthrax spores as agent of biowarfare has been as aerosol. however, they could also be disseminated through the food or water supply for targeting of the gastrointestinal tract.

anthrax infections fall into three different categories, reflecting the route of entry; inhalational, gastrointestinal or cutaneous in order of severity of the infection. with regard to bioterrorism, the most realistic mode of mass exposure includes inhalational or gastrointestinal infections. conceptually, the idea of targeting the food supply is not new  <cit>  and a few records of planned use of anthrax spores for deliberately targeting the oral route exist  <cit> . however, relatively little is known about the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal anthrax, despite its prevalence in ruminant livestock. initial infection is established in the peyer''s patches throughout the small intestine, eventually leading to systemic infection by spreading to the draining jejunal lymph nodes, the spleen and, finally, the lungs. gastrointestinal infection by b. anthracis preferentially occurs after abrasions in the mucosa but can also occur in the absence of damage in which case infection propagation is slower  <cit> . natural occurrence of human gastrointestinal anthrax in the western world is rare due to the high standard of the food supply chain but is more common than inhalational anthrax in the developing world  <cit> .

the pathogenesis of b. anthracis is due to the product of three plasmid encoded  toxicity genes; paga , lef  and cya  expressing a tripartite protein complex, causing the lethal symptoms associated with anthrax. the protective antigen  combines with the lethal factor  and edema factor  to form the lethal toxin  and edema toxin  respectively  <cit> . pa is the component affording binding to either of two receptors, the tumor endothelial marker  <dig>  and the capillary morphogenesis  <dig>   <cit> . the receptor bound pa is proteolytically activated facilitating oligomerization of pa into a heptameric prepore structure, forming the binding sites for lf and ef. the complete toxin complex is endocytosed and, upon acidification of the early endosome, the prepore undergoes conformational change whereby lf and ef are translocated into the cytosol . lf is a metalloprotease cleaving mapk  kinases  <cit> , inactivating mapk signaling pathways and inducing an atypical vascular collapse in mice  <cit> . ef is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase which increases cyclic amp levels in cells and induces extensive intestinal fluid accumulation and hemorrhaging lesions  <cit> . both active and passive vaccination strategies against anthrax have previously been attempted and directed primarily towards inactivation of the toxin components, where pa is the dominant immunogen, and several neutralising antibodies binding to epitopes blocking the binding to its receptors have previously been developed  <cit> .

anthrax vaccine adsorbed  is at present the only vaccine licensed for use in the united states for prophylactic treatment against anthrax. however, the vaccine requires multiple injections over 12- <dig> months in order to be effective  <cit>  and due to its cost and side effects, therapeutic treatment is currently considered more cost effective  <cit> . therapeutic treatment for anthrax infection is based on antibiotic use, post exposure vaccination and anti-toxin antibodies, with a combinatorial approach of rapid post exposure vaccination combined with antibiotics treatment being the most promising  <cit> . faced with the possibility of anthrax strains being engineered for resistance to current antibiotics, the need for alternative treatments grow.

lactobacilli are gram-positive bacteria constituting part of the normal oro-gastrointestinal flora  <cit>  and generally regarded as safe  for human consumption. their ability to colonise and thrive in the gastrointestinal tract has directed attention to their potential use for therapeutic and prophylactic delivery of biomolecules  <cit> . engineered lactobacilli have previously been used to deliver antibody fragments targeting both viral and bacterial infections  <cit> . scfvs, while retaining the specificity of the monoclonal antibody from which they are derived, has a simpler structure, allowing production in bacterial expression systems. several anthrax toxin neutralising scfvs have been derived from neutralising monoclonal antibodies or by panning of scfv libraries. the anti-anthrax pa scfv 1h is derived from the 14b <dig> monoclonal antibody through molecular evolution, yielding a highly stable scfv with increased binding affinity  <cit> .

we have developed several recombinant lactobacilli expressing a single-chain antibody fragment  against the pa toxin, and tested their ability to provide passive immunity against anthrax toxin in the gastrointestinal tract.

RESULTS
construction of anti-pa expressing recombinant lactobacillus
a series of anti-pa neutralising scfvs have previously been generated through random mutagenesis of the monoclonal antibody 14b <dig>  <cit> . the 1h scfv, had a kd of  <dig>  nm, nine fold lower than the parent monoclonal antibody and provided protection both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . to evaluate the therapeutic potential of lactobacillus expressing a scfv against anthrax toxin, a series of expression cassettes was constructed with the 1h scfv encoding gene placed under the control of the apf promoter and fused to the apf signal peptide at the n-terminal and with a c-terminal e-tag for detection . variations in the c-terminal parts of the plasmids gives rise to three different methods of production of the scfv. in paf100-1hscfv, a stop codon just terminal of the e-tag leaves the scfv secreted into the media , paf900-1hscfv has the c-terminal e-tag fused to the prtp anchoring domain leading the scfv to be covalently bound and displayed on the cell wall upon secretion from the cell , and lastly, paf400-1hscfv, where the e-tag is fused to the anchoring domain of the apf gene which attaches the scfv non-covalently to the cell wall upon secretion, .

expression and correct localisation of the three constructs upon transformation into lactobacillus paracasei was verified by western blot analysis of the supernatant and cell fractions of cultures grown in mrs . the scfv expressed by both the secreted  and anchored constructs  were found primarily in the expected fraction, the supernatant for kka <dig> and the cell fraction for kka <dig>  some scfv were found in the supernatant fraction of the lactobacilli expressing the anchored construct, which is likely to be due either to saturation of anchoring sites or inefficient anchoring of the scfv. for lactobacilli expressing the attached construct, kka <dig>  the scfv was found to be bound to the cell wall but also secreted into the media in significant amounts. this is probably due to the weaker nature of the non-covalent binding to the cell wall of the apf binding domain. the total scfv production for the lactobacilli expressing the attached construct was 2- <dig> fold higher, relative to the two other constructs, despite being expressed from the same promoter. we have previously observed this effect for scfv fusions to the apf anchoring domain  <cit>  suggesting that the fusion could be beneficial for the secretion or stability of the scfv fragments in the supernatant.

the three expression constructs provide a choice for the mechanism of neutralisation 1; anchored and attached scfv constructs immobilising pa on the cell wall of the lactobacilli and clearing of bound pa from the intestinal tract by gastric emptying 2; secreted scfv expression as seen both using the secreted construct and the attached construct where a significant proportion of the scfv are non-cell wall attached, leading to diffusion of the neutralising scfvs in the gastrointestinal lumen with subsequent binding and inactivation of pa.

binding activity of 1h scfv
binding activity of the scfv from the culture supernatants from lactobacilli transformed with the secreted and attached constructs, was analysed by elisa. scfvs from both strains bound to pa coated microtiter plates . six and a half ng/ml  and nine ng/ml  was produced by the lactobacilli expressing the secreted and attached construct respectively, when quantified using a purified his tagged 1h scfv produced in e. coli as a positive control.

presence of the 1h scfv on the cell wall in the lactobacilli transformed with the anchored  or attached  construct was tested by flow cytometry  . for the anchored construct , a strong positive signal confirmed the surface location of the scfv. bacteria transformed with the attached construct  did not stain, indicating that either the scfv is not displayed on the surface or that the e-tag is embedded in the membrane due to its close proximity to the anchoring domain and thus not accessible to the anti-e-tag antibody.

using pa conjugated florescent beads, a strong binding to the kka <dig> strain , but not strain kka <dig> displaying 1h scfv attached was observed . the lack of binding observed with the lactobacilli expressing the attached construct might arise due to that the scfv are not protruding far enough from the cell wall to afford effective binding. we have recently shown that close proximity of the scfv attached with the apf anchoring domain may inhibit the binding activity of a cell wall anchored scfv  <cit> . insertion of an spacer increasing the length of the anchoring domain could potentially resolve this as it has previously been shown by us to improve binding of cell wall display of antibody fragments  <cit> .

in vitro protection
the ability of the lactobacillus produced anti-pa scfvs to protect against the toxin in vitro was assessed using the j <dig> mΦ cell line by exposing it to a lethal dose lt. two fold serial dilutions of the 1h scfv, purified from the supernatant from the kka <dig>  and kka <dig>  strains, were pre-mixed with the toxin complex  before challenge. a dose of  <dig>  μg/ml of secreted scfv afforded complete protection, corresponding to a molar ratio of  <dig> : <dig> of 1h scfv  to pa  . the scfv from the lactobacilli transformed with the attached construct , afforded nearly full protection at a dose of  <dig>  μg/ml and full protection was conferred at  <dig> μg/ml, translating to a molar ratio of 5: <dig> and 10: <dig> respectively. 1h scfv produced and purified from e. coli were also tested and showed protection at corresponding doses  indicating that the binding affinity of the 1h scfv fragment is maintained when utilising the lactobacillus based expression system.

in vivo protection
to test the prophylactic effect of recombinant lactobacilli expressing the 1h scfv we developed a mouse model of oral challenge with bacillus anthracis edema toxin . et was previously shown to cause massive fluid retention and swelling  and intravenous injection shown to induce intestinal intralumenal fluid accumulation  <cit> . in our model of oral et challenge a dose of  <dig> to  <dig> μg et causes a significant fluid accumulation in the small and large intestine  <dig> hours post oral exposure leading to a 10-15% increase in total intestinal weight . to mimic a stable colonisation achievable with good colonising bacterial strains the recombinant lactobacilli were given both  <dig> hours before and simultaneous with the toxin challenge. mice receiving lactobacillus expressing the attached construct  and no et were used as negative controls and had a median relative intestinal weight of  <dig> % of the total body weight . the groups receiving either toxin only or the non-protective l. paracasei paf <dig> expressing attached a scfv against an irrelevant antigen  together with et, had median relative intestinal weights of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, giving an increase in the median relative intestinal weight of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . for the group treated with lactobacillus expressing the 1h scfv in an attached form , the median relative intestinal weight was  <dig> % upon challenge with et, i.e. in the same range as the negative control and significantly lower compared to mice receiving et only , indicating a blocking of the uptake of et in the intestine. mice treated with lactobacillus expressing 1h scfv either in a secreted or anchored form together with et, did not show any significant difference when compared to the et only group .

the reason why, in contrast to the attached construct, the secreted or anchored constructs failed to provide protection, remain to be elucidated. one explanation might be the dual function of the attached construct where the scfv is both cell wall displayed and secreted into the supernatant. the secreted part of the 1h scfv produced by the attached construct would have an unbound cell wall attaching domain, allowing it to re-attach to the cell wall of lactobacilli after binding to pa. this could theoretically provide a therapeutic advantage as the lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal flora could function as a binding reservoir for the attached 1h scfv, mopping up pa and immobilising it on the bacteria.

to examine if the attached 1h scfv could re-attach to the cell wall of lactobacilli we therefore grew a non-expressing strain of l. paracasei  in media with and without the attached 1h scfv. western blot analysis of the cell pellet of the cultures showed a clear re-attachment of the 1h scfv on the cell wall of the non-expressing strain  when grown in media containing the scfv . homologous binding domains are also found in other gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  but further studies would be needed to determine if re-attachment also occur on other bacteria and if this is a parameter for neutralisation with the attached construct.

however since only one of three constructs was successful in providing neutralisation in vivo certain issues still needs to be addressed for therapeutic engineering of lactobacilli for antibody expression. the length of the anchoring domain and polarity of the scfv might influence the extension of the scfv from the bacterial cell wall for and thereby affect binding. stability of secreted scfvs might likewise be a determining factor for successful neutralisation and engineering of the scfvs for improved stability in the gastrointestinal lumen would likely improve the therapeutic effect  <cit> .

the strategy of using lactobacilli for delivery of protective antibody fragments relies on their ability to thrive and colonise in the gastrointestinal tract. in the described study a engineered laboratory strain of l. paracasei were used as a proof of concept for mediation of in situ neutralisation in the gastrointestinal tract. for efficient continuous delivery of antibody fragments a lactobacillus strain characterised for long-term colonisation in the host should be selected.

recombinant lactobacilli have previously also been successfully used as a delivery system for oral vaccination with recombinant pa fused to a dendritic cell targeting peptide, giving a protective response four weeks after first oral dose  <cit> . though effective, induction of a protective immune response might be too slow to provide protection in the case of an imminent risk of exposure. for effective protection a dual strategy of both passive immunity and oral vaccination could therefore be advantageous providing both rapid protection and protective immunity.

the use of toxin neutralising antibody fragments in the gastrointestinal tract can potentially be used as treatment against other pathogens like clostridium difficile, vibrio cholera and e.coli o157:h. recently a neutralising single domain antibody fragment  against clostridium difficile toxin a was developed  <cit>  illustrating this approach. we have previously shown that vhh can be produced at high levels using the described expression system and in addition have advantages over scfvs for expression in lactobacilli  <cit> , so as more vhh are being developed their use expressed from engineered lactobacilli for therapies in the gastrointestinal tract will likely increase.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate a possibility of employing a recombinant approach for neutralisation of bacterial toxins in the gastrointestinal tract as illustrated here, targeting anthrax toxins, using genetically engineered lactobacillus. in the present study we have shown that a high affinity anti-pa scfv can be expressed both cell wall anchored and secreted by lactobacilli and retain its binding affinity. in vivo neutralisation was achieved in a mouse model of oral toxin challenge with engineered lactobacilli expressing the neutralising scfv with an apf anchoring domain. using recombinant lactobacillus for induction of passive immunity in the gastrointestinal tract as described in this study provides a possibility for a continuous delivery of the antibody in situ that can be used both therapeutically and prophylactically. the approach can also be extended to targeting of a range of toxins produced by a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens.
