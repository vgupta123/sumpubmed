BACKGROUND
the cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera, is a destructive and highly polyphagous insect pest in asia, europe, africa, and australia. it causes serious damage to cotton, sorghum, corn and several other crops. further aggravating the situation, this pest is spreading geographically by invading newer territory. recently, their presence outside the asian continent has been confirmed with reports of establishment of this species in brazil  <cit> . primary methods of controlling this devastating agricultural pest include traditional spraying of pesticides and cultivation of transgenic pest resistant crop varieties developed in the recent past. however, apart from causing environmental pollution these methods also lead to resistance development in pests, thus necessitating immediate development of novel biological control methods. entomopathogenic fungi like beauveria bassiana has been widely considered as a potent eco-friendly bio-control agent  <cit> . the potential of b. bassiana as an effective suppressant of h. armigera and other lepidopteran pests is under consideration  <cit> . before b. bassiana kills the pest, it needs to invade and overcome the host immune responses that have not been well understood in h. armigera.

the invasion of pathogens and parasites into an insect is defended by innate immune system, a strong universal defense mechanism shared by both vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . this system consists of initial physical barriers to pathogen penetration followed by humoral and cellular response against subsequent microbial infection. while the cellular response involves phagocytosis, encapsulation, and nodule formation by the circulating hemocytes, the humoral response refers to the process of melanization and the production of immune effector molecules, which are mainly produced in the fat body. anti-bacterial immunity depends on two principal signaling pathways, toll and imd, which are conserved across various insect species indicating their central importance throughout arthropod evolution  <cit> . these pathways are activated by the binding of pattern recognition receptors  such as peptidoglycan recognition protein , β- <dig> -glucan recognition protein , c-type lectin  to pathogen associated molecular pattern  on the surface of invading microorganisms  <cit> . specifically, gram-negative bacteria trigger the imd pathway leading to an acute response, while gram-positive bacteria and fungi activate the toll pathway eliciting a more sustained and complex reaction  <cit> . both of these signaling pathways result in the induction of various nf-кb transcription factors, which then drive a comprehensive synthesis of immune effectors including antimicrobial peptides   <cit> . like immune signaling pathways, melanization which results from the activation of prophenoloxidase , is also considered as an universal immune response against bacteria in insects  <cit> . it involves melanin synthesis, sequestering and killing the invading microorganisms or parasites  <cit> .

after invading the host, b. bassiana triggers the cellular and humoral immune mechanism of the host resulting in melanized nodules and activation of toll pathway  <cit> . the toll signaling pathway is mediated by an extracellular protease cascade composed of a series of clip-domain serine protease , which helps to amplify the initial recognition signal  <cit> . several immune molecules like gnbp <dig>  persephone, and drosomycin are involved in the fungus activated toll pathway  <cit> . besides the toll pathway, melanization is also implicated to play a role in antifungal immunity. b. bassiana infection of mosquito aedes aegypti enhances the cleavage of hemolymph ppo and its conversion to phenoloxidase , the rate limiting enzyme in melanogenesis  <cit> . similarly, induced melanization in another mosquito anopheles gambiae retarded the growth and dissemination of b. bassiana  <cit> . however, the thorough understanding of interaction between melanization and fungal challenge is largely unclear.

b. bassiana parasitizes a wide range of hosts including h. armigera and other lepidopteran pests. most studies on insect immunity were performed in model organisms, such as drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , manduca sexta  <cit> , and tenebrio molitor  <cit> . systematic analysis of immunity-related genes has been conducted in several other insects including a. gambiae, a. aegypti, bombyx mori, apis mellifera and tribolium castaneum, whose genome sequences are available. it is only recently that h. armigera immunity started to attract some researchers’ attentions  <cit> . fourteen genes involved in the h. armigera interaction with bacillus thuringiensis and autographa californica multiple nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus were obtained  <cit> . the expression and characterization of ctls and pgrps in response to pathogen were also reported  <cit> . however, h. armigera genome is still unavailable and its immune response to b. bassiana remains largely unexplored, restricting its further development and adoption as a biological agent in the control of lepidopteran pests.

more interestingly, systematic survey on h. armigera is of great importance for understanding the origin and evolution of immune systems, which is a challenging task since genetic backgrounds of non-model insects are unclear, let alone expression profiling. in this work, rna-seq was employed to perform immunotranscriptome analysis of h. armigera larval hemocytes and fat body in response to the challenges of entomopathogenic fungi b. bassiana and gram-negative bacteria enterobactor cloacae. in an attempt to gain insights into the h. armigera immune response against pathogens, we characterized  <dig> such genes and divided them into pattern recognition, signal transduction, execution, and cellular responses. hierarchical clustering analyses of differentially expressed gene  cohorts indicated that the fungi and bacteria elicited distinct expression profiles of genes in hemocytes and fat body. these results provide an overview of the tissue-specific expression profiles in response to infections and a platform for further exploring the molecular basis of host antimicrobial response.

RESULTS
immunization, sequencing assembly, and gene identification
most immunity studies on lepidopteran insects use dead microbes, aiming at deciphering biochemical mechanisms. in contrast, dipteran insects such as drosophila and mosquitoes are often injected with live pathogens, which eventually kill the hosts. in order to decipher host-pathogen interactions and develop better pest control methods, we performed septic injury on day  <dig> fifth instar larvae using two entomopathogens, b. bassiana, and e. cloacae, which elicit an inefficient immune response compared with the challenge by dead pathogens. the immunity-related genes based on their expression profiles in fat body or hemocytes were obtained through comparison of the immune challenged transcriptomes. these two entomopathogenic agents had distinct morphological characteristics on plates and under light microscope . e. cloacae injected larvae turned light red in color at 12 h after infection and were almost completely liquefied before death by 24 h , as compared with the light brown color in larvae that were injected with the phosphate buffered saline . fungal infection on the other hand was slower, with almost 85% survival rate at 24 h post injection as compared to the 15% of that of bacteria . b. bassiana injected larvae turned dark brown and were finally covered with white conidia and hyphae at 72 h post infection, leading to the death of the insect. these results suggested a distinct pathogenicity of b. bassiana and e. cloacae toward the cotton bollworm.figure  <dig> distinct pathogenicity and transcriptomic change elicited by b. bassiana and e. cloacae.  different phenotypes of the cotton bollworm larvae infected with b. bassiana  and e. cloacae . the b. bassiana-infected larvae were covered with white hyphae at  <dig> h post infection and then became rigid before death. however, e. cloacae-infected larvae turned light red at  <dig> h post infection and became gradually liquefied before death.  survival curves of h. armigera larvae infected by bb  and ec  in comparison with the control group . three repeats, p <  <dig> .  hierarchical clustering analysis of dets in fat bodies and hemocytes of h. armigera larvae infected by bb  <dig> h post infection and ec  <dig> h post infection, respectively. the transcript levels significantly  increased  and decreased  under at least two experimental conditions. the heatmap is divided into five discrete clusters and color coded on the left. cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  in hemocytes from bb infected larvae; cluster  <dig>  and  <dig>  induced in fat body of bb and ec infected larvae, respectively; cluster  <dig>  genes suppressed in fat body of bb and ec infected larvae. fb_mock, control fat body; fb_bb, fungus-induced fat body; fb_ec, bacterium-induced fat body; hc_mock, control hemocytes; hc_bb, fungus-induced hemocytes; hc_ec, bacterium-induced hemocytes.  a venn diagram showing the shared and unique dets in fat body and hemocytes, induced by the fungal and bacterial infection. the overlapping regions represent genes that are concomitantly regulated in two, three or four samples. the directions of transcript level changes are indicated by upward- and downward-pointing arrows. blue, green, brown and purple represent bb-fat body, ec-fat body, bb-hemocytes, and ec-hemocytes, respectively.



in d. melanogaster and mosquitoes, immunity-related genes regulated by imd pathway showed an acute expression pattern involved in the anti-bacterial responses, whereas toll pathway displayed sustained activation of immunity-related genes against fungal infection  <cit> . to gain detailed information about the h. armigera transcriptome, the hemocytes and fat body samples were collected from e. cloacae infected larvae at 6 h and b. bassiana infected larvae at 48 h, respectively. six cdna libraries were constructed from the rna samples extracted from control fat body , fungus-induced fat body , bacterium-induced fat body , control hemocytes , fungus-induced hemocytes , and bacterium-induced hemocytes  . these libraries were sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> system. after removal of adaptor sequences and low-quality reads , these libraries yielded  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  million high-quality reads with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  gb data, respectively . all the reads were de novo assembled into  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  contigs with average lengths of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt, respectively  <cit> . pooled clean reads from the six libraries and three others , totally yielded  <dig>  contigs  .

to predict functions, all the obtained unigenes were annotated according to blastx searches against the non-redundant sequence database resulting  <dig>   of them displaying homology to the known proteins    <cit> . for species distribution, nearly  <dig>   annotated unigenes were homologous to b. mori, followed by danaus plexippus . only fewer transcripts were matched to the ones from h. armigera , probably due to the unavailability of its genome sequences . additionally,  <dig> transcripts with high similarity to non-coding rnas by homology search were obtained   <cit> . after removing redundant sequences and those shorter than  <dig> nt, we retained the unigenes with significant blast hits and generated a non-redundant dataset containing  <dig>  sequences  . length distribution of the h. armigera transcripts indicates that this final dataset has a high proportion of long transcripts  and increases the chances of full length gene predictions. based on the unigene information  , the immunity-related genes were identified and filtered out for further analysis. the detailed workflow from immune challenge to immunity-related gene identification is provided in a flowchart .

identification and functional classification of differentially expressed genes in response to b. bassiana and e. cloacae infections
to gain insights into the tissue-specific transcriptional changes in h. armigera larvae infected by b. bassiana and e. cloacae, we performed pairwise comparisons between libraries to identify the differentially expressed transcripts    <cit> . relative to the control, transcripts with greater than 2-fold change and p value less than  <dig>  were considered as differentially expressed. the complete list of dets with fpkm  values  revealed that more unigenes exhibited remarkable changes in mrna levels in fat body  than in hemocytes  6 h after e. cloacae injection  indicating a tissue-specific affect. more pronounced changes occurred to the larvae 48 h after b. bassiana injection. compared to the control group, there were  <dig>   transcripts that were significantly changed in the fat body elicited by b. bassiana, while more transcripts  suppressed in hemocytes were observed.

in order to compare gene expression levels in hemocytes and fat body in response to the pathogen invasion, we performed hierarchical clustering of dets and identified five discrete clusters showing expression trends relevant to the infection. the  <dig> and  <dig>  genes in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest and the lowest rna levels in hemocytes from b. bassiana infected larvae, respectively, among all the experimental conditions . clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed the most significant mrna level increase in fat body after the fungal and bacterial infection, respectively. furthermore, cluster  <dig> represented gene cohorts significantly suppressed in hemocytes and fat body after the infections. consistent with the information revealed by hierarchical clustering, a venn diagram analysis indicated that  <dig>  transcripts were exclusively regulated in the fungus challenged fat body , while  <dig>  other transcripts were specifically regulated in the fungus challenged hemocytes  . in comparison, fewer gene transcripts  were exclusively regulated in the two tissues after the bacterial infection. considering that the gene repertoire of fat body had small overlap with that of hemocytes , we speculate that tissue type instead of the pathogen is more important in regulating the gene transcription under the same experimental condition. besides, the data showed consistent up-regulation of  <dig> genes in both fat body and hemocytes after the fungal and bacterial infection and most of them were immunity-related.

to analyze the potential functions of all identified dets and the corresponding pathways involved, the gene ontology  enrichment and kegg analysis were further performed for dets  <cit> . functional classification of all unigenes was determined by go assignment. in the gene repertoire of fat body, more dets from the e. cloacae elicited transcriptome were assigned binding and catalytic activities in the category of molecular function and cellular and metabolic processes in biological process . in contrast, more dets from b. bassiana elicited hemocyte transcriptome were enriched in the following go terms: cell, cell part, organelle, and organelle part in cellular component, binding in molecular function, and biological regulation and cellular process in biological process. we also used kegg classification to analyze putative functions of the b. bassiana and e. cloacae induced dets, which were categorized into thirteen functional groups based on the biological processes and molecular functions  <cit> . there was a remarkable tissue related disparity among the major functional gene groups between the fungi and bacteria induced transcriptomes . except in e. cloacae elicited hemocytes, a large proportion of up-regulated gene repertoire encoded enzymes involved in carbohydrate, energy, transport and catabolism, and immunity-related processes. other notable functional gene groups were xenobiotics, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, folding, sorting and degradation. in particular, such gene transcripts formed the largest group that were down-regulated in hemocytes after b. bassiana infection, followed by genes involved in replication and repair. we performed the principal component analysis  to compare changes in the transcriptomes and found clear variation between fat body and hemocyte samples . another variation exists between pathogen treated and control groups, whereas ec or bb treated samples are mostly similar. it appears that the difference between the tissues was much more significant than that between different pathogens.figure  <dig> comparative transcriptome analysis and identification of immunity-related genes in h. armigera.  gene ontology  annotation of dets in the h. armigera transcriptome. enriched go analysis  of dets between b. bassiana  and e. cloacae  infections are performed by pairwise comparison with the corresponding control group of fat body  or hemocytes . level  <dig> go assignments are made in terms of cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. the number of gene transcripts assigned to each go term is shown on the right y-axis, and its percentage of the total number of transcripts is on the left y-axis.  distribution of kegg functional groups within up- and down-regulated gene cohorts in fat body and hemocytes from the bb and ec-infected larvae. the bar chart corresponds to the matched entries of dets in their own functional category.  principal component analysis  analysis of global gene expression in hemocytes and fat body in response to the infections. six samples were analyzed, including bb-affected fat body  and hemocytes , ec-affected fat body  and hemocytes , control fat body  and hemocytes .  distribution of h. armigera immunity-related transcripts in categories of recognition, signaling, regulation, and effectors.



taken together, our results clearly indicated that global gene expression profiles varied among different tissues and treatments . while tissue is the major determinant, other factors also have minor but significant impacts on the transcriptome. the distinct go and kegg distribution of up- and down-regulated gene cohorts showed similar trends. detailed expression profiling of the immunity-related genes was still required for further investigation of tissue-specific immune responses against b. bassiana and e. cloacae infection.

for in-depth analysis of the interactions between h. armigera and pathogens, we annotated the insect defense genes and examined their phylogenetic relationships. by sequencing the tissues that were enriched in the immune-related transcripts at sufficient depth, followed by the blast search  <cit> , we were able to detect  <dig> immunity-related genes . this number was significantly higher when compared with other insects from holometabolous orders, such as a. mellifera, but similar to that in b. mori. this result indicated that h. armigera, well adapted to various plant hosts and environment, has a sizable repertoire of genes related to the cellular and humoral immune responses against the wounding and infection.

comparative analysis of genes for immune signal recognition
when pathogens infect insects, multiple prrs may recognize conserved determinants  on the pathogen surface to trigger host defense reactions  <cit> . while some prrs are constitutively expressed as surveillance molecules at certain levels in hemolymph, others are synthesized in response to the entry of microorganisms. upon binding to their target molecules, prrs undergo a conformational change required for recruiting plasma factors and hemocytes that eliminate the invading pathogens  <cit> , finally leading to ppo activation and synthesis of immune effectors  via immune signaling pathways  <cit> . the h. armigera immunotranscriptome has at least  <dig> prr transcripts, including  <dig> pgrps,  <dig> βgrps,  <dig> ctls, and  <dig> galectins .

pgrps play a pivotal role in activating insect innate immunity by binding to lys- and diaminopimelate-type peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls  <cit> . the members of this protein family are characterized by the presence of a conserved c-terminal pgrp domain , which is homologous to bacteriophage and bacterial type  <dig> amidases  <cit> . pgrps can be further sub-grouped into short  and long  forms based on their length and the presence of transmembrane domain. there are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> pgrps in the genomes of d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, b mori and a. mellifera, respectively. we have identified nine putative pgrp transcripts in h. armigera transcriptome and have named them as hapgrp-sa <dig>  −sa <dig>  −sb <dig>  −sb <dig>  −sd, −la, −lb, −lc, −ld, in accordance with pgrp nomenclature from other insects   <cit> . the mrna abundances of h. armigera pgrp-sa <dig>  −sb <dig>  and -sd increased in response to the bacterial infection, and their roles in bacteria agglutination and growth inhibition have been characterized as well  <cit> . multiple sequence alignment suggested that pgrp-sb <dig>  −sb <dig>  −sd contains all the five active site residues  essential for amidase activity, indicating that they can not only bind but also degrade peptidoglycan . based on their homology to bmpgrp-s <dig> and s <dig>  a putative role of hapgrp-sa <dig>  −sb <dig> and sb <dig> in regulation of ppo activation can be predicted  <cit> . all the s form hapgrps have an n-terminal signal peptide and are expected to be secreted outside the cell . on the other hand, hapgrp-la, −lb, −lc, −ld contains a transmembrane region, potentially serving as peptidoglycan receptors triggering immune signaling pathways. there existed no pgrp-le in h. armigera with similarity to that of a. gambiae, b. mori, and a. mellifera, while pgrp-ld has not been identified in b. mori .figure  <dig> the pg recognition proteins of h. armigera.  schematic representations of the h. armigera pgrp domain structures. lengths of the amino acid sequences are indicated.  phylogenetic analysis of pgrps. the amino acid sequences of 9 h. armigera , 7 t. castaneum ,  <dig> d. melanogastor ,  <dig> b. mori , and  <dig> a. mellifera  pgrps are compared. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site. the tree shows that hapgrp and bmpgrps form good orthologous groups, except for hapgrp-ld. red dots at nodes indicate bootstrap values greater than  <dig> from  <dig>  trials. the putative 1: <dig> or 1:1: <dig> orthologs were connected by green lines. hapgrp-la, −lb, −lc, and -ld contain a transmembrane domain, while hapgrp-sa <dig>  −sa <dig>  −sb <dig>  −sb <dig>  and -sd have a signal peptide. hapgrp-sb <dig> -sb <dig>  and -sd contain the key residues of the amidase activity that hydrolyzes pgs.



βgrps belong to another family of prrs, which have a β- <dig>  3-glucanase-like domain close to the carboxyl terminus  <cit> . they could bind to β- <dig>  3-glucan  but lack the hydrolase activity, due to amino acid substitutions in the catalytic center. other members of the family are referred to as gnbps . it has been reported that the mrna level of b. mori gnbp was significantly elevated in response to bacterial infection  <cit> . in our transcriptome, five βgrp transcripts are identified and designated as h. armigera βgrp <dig> through  <dig>  all of which may be secreted into hemolymph except βgrp <dig> . the phylogenetic analysis of insect βgrp gene family revealed segregation into two major evolutionary groups – one retaining the key residues for glucanase activity  and the other lacking such residues   <cit> . h. armigera and b. mori βgrp <dig>  2a, and  <dig> share a 1: <dig> orthology, while h. armigera βgrp- <dig> is orthologous to m. sexta mbp  <cit> . βgrp1- <dig> belong to a lepidopteran specific clade probably arising as a result of gene duplication . based on the studies in m. sexta and orthologous relationships, we suggest that h. armigera βgrp <dig> and 2a bind to β- <dig> -glucan to trigger a serine protease cascade for ppo activation. the close relationships among h. armigera βgrp <dig>  2a, 2b,  <dig> and d. melanogaster gnbp <dig> also indicate that the two β- <dig> -glucanase-related proteins could be involved in antifungal immunity of h. armigera.figure  <dig> the β- <dig> -glucanase related proteins  of h. armigera.  schematic representations of the domain structure of h. armigera βgrps. lengths of the amino acid sequences are indicated.  phylogenetic relationships of the βgrps. sequences of the βgrp family members from 5 h. armigera , 3 t. castaneum ,  <dig> d. melanogaster ,  <dig> b. mori ,  <dig> a. mellifera  pgrps,  <dig> a. aegypti , and 2 m. sexta  are aligned to build the tree. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site. bacillus circulans  β- <dig> -glucanase is included as an out-group.



c-type lectins  are a sub-group of carbohydrate binding lectin proteins that require the presence of calcium for its association with various types of sugar moieties like mannose and galactose. the protein family shows a considerable amount of diversity in terms of structure and function and can occur in membrane bound or soluble forms. several insect ctls have been implicated to play a role in host defense functioning as prrs and eliciting multiple immune responses including ppo activation, hemocyte-mediated nodule formation, encapsulation and opsonization finally resulting in microbial clearance  <cit> . previous studies have cloned and characterized eight h. armigera ctls, of which ctl <dig> has been characterized to play a role in bacterial agglutination  <cit> . another member ctl <dig>  apart from having a function similar to ctl <dig>  can also enhance cellular encapsulation and melanization  <cit> . our in-depth immunotranscriptomic studies have identified a total of twenty-four ctls ,  <dig> of which are novel transcripts, much more than the pgrp and βgrp family size, thus significantly expanding our knowledge about ctl gene family in this devastating insect pest. in terms of domain structure , thirteen  had two tandem carbohydrate recognition domains , while eleven  possessed only one. in addition to one crd domain, ctl <dig> and  <dig> had three sushi and eleven sushi domains, respectively. thirteen ctls formed an independent clade in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting a possible gene expansion of this family in h. armigera . the phylogenetic analysis indicates that ctls containing two crds are in the same group, suggesting a lepidopteran specific family expansion. h. armigera ctl <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are orthologous to m. sexta immulectin- <dig>  which agglutinated e. coli and might anchor the ppo activation reaction in the vicinity of microbial cells  <cit> . along with this group, hactl <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were clustered together with msiml- <dig> and msiml <dig> in a bigger clade. hactl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> formed three distinct clades along with the respective ctls from a. mellifera, t. castaneum, d. melanogaster, a. aegypti, b. mori, and acyrthosiphon pisum. these three clades are in turn part of a single branch in the phylogenetic tree which is distant from other major branches, and are characterized as galactose binding ctls  with qpd signature sequence. however, we could not find h. armigera homologue of a. gambiae ctl <dig> and ctlma <dig>  which prevented plasmodium from melanization  <cit> . our findings imply that h. armigera ctls are much more diversified than other insect groups and may arise from gene duplications catering to specific pathogen interactions. apart from ctls, another class of lectins-galectins that were found in diverse groups of insects and known to bind to β-galactoside were also essential for pathogen recognition  <cit> . h. armigera immunotranscriptome revealed three galectins, displaying  <dig> to  <dig> orthologous relationship with b. mori galectins .figure  <dig> the c-type lectins  and galectins of h. armigera.  phylogenetic analysis of ctls. the amino acid sequences of 24 h. armigera , 10 t. castaneum ,  <dig> d. melanogaster ,  <dig> b. mori , 4 m. sexta ,  <dig> a. aegypti ,  <dig> a. gambiae ,  <dig> acyrthosiphon pisum  and  <dig> a. mellifera  ctls are examined. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site.  phylogenetic analysis of galectins. the amino acid sequences of  <dig> ha,  <dig> tc,  <dig> dm,  <dig> bm,  <dig> ag and  <dig> am galectins are compared. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site.



some thioester-containing proteins , belonging to c3/α- <dig> macroglobulin superfamily, harbor an intrachain β-cysteinyl-γ-glutamyl thioester bond, which is used for self- or non-self-identification  <cit> . α2-macroglobulin is a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor using a trapping mechanism through its thioester linkage. during the immune responses, complement factors c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> bind to self/non-self surfaces via the same bond. in mosquitos, tep family presents extensive gene duplication, with  <dig> genes in a. gambiae,  <dig> in a. aegypti, and  <dig> in c. pipiens  <cit> . in a. gambiae, tep <dig> played the key role in blocking plasmodium oocyst proliferation in the midgut  <cit> . helicoverpa, however, has a relatively small tep family with only four members which are homologous to b. mori teps . since h. armigera tep <dig> contains the signature motif gcgeq, it is probably involved in immune surveillance against pathogens or parasites.

based on sequence homology search, we have also identified other h. armigera prrs encoded by  <dig> scavenger receptors class b ,  <dig> hemocytin,  <dig> hemolin,  <dig> dscam,  <dig> draper,  <dig> rhol,  <dig> rap <dig>   <dig> enabled,  <dig> fascin,  <dig> scar,  <dig> dizzy,  <dig> tm9sf <dig>   <dig> integrin,  <dig> noduler, and  <dig> eater, which are involved in phagocytosis, encapsulation, and various other cellular immune responses   <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of the scr-bs  demonstrated that h. armigera and b. mori scr-bs were most likely to form the orthologous pairs. the h. armigera scr-b <dig> might function in phagocytosis of the apoptotic bodies, since it is orthologous to d. melanogaster croquemort . the presence of a large number of prr genes in the immunotranscriptome of h. armigera, indicated their involvement in the immune response to the infection of b. bassiana and e. cloacae.

genes involved in melanization and extracellular signal modulation
upon prr binding, the invading microbes may lead to the ppo activation. as key enzymes in the melanization reaction, the copper-containing phenoloxidases are activated from its inactive zymogens by specific proteolytic cleavage  <cit> . active phenoloxidases catalyze the conversion of monophenols to o-diphenols and further oxidation of o-diphenols to quinones, which then polymerize to form melanin that entraps and kills microbial pathogens and parasites  <cit> . except for mosquitoes, most insects had one to three ppos  <cit> . similar to other lepidopteran species, two ppo transcripts were identified in the h. armigera transcriptome. the h. armigera ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> share  <dig> % and 79% of identity in amino acid sequence to the b. mori ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> , respectively. the phylogenetic analysis establishes the orthologous groups of happo1-bmppo1-msppo <dig> and happo2-bmppo2-msppo <dig> .

serine proteases  and their non-catalytic homologs  constitute one of the largest protein family in insects that are functionally involved in various physiological processes such as digestion, development, hemolymph clotting, and immune responses  <cit> . hemolymph sp cascades, comprised of multiple clip-domain sps , are essential for proteolytic activation of ppo and the processing of toll pathway ligand, spätzle, which will be discussed in detail in the next section. in total, we have identified  <dig> sps and  <dig> sphs in h. armigera transcriptome . among them,  <dig> have complete sequences containing entire open reading frames . apart from these csps, five other sps  were shown to contain the structural modules important for protein-protein interactions, such as ldla, sushi, and srcr. detailed analysis of sps revealed the orthology among h. armigera sp <dig>  m. sexta hp <dig> and d. melanogaster modular sp. the respective sps from m. sexta and d. melanogaster apparently are the first key enzymes triggering ppo activation and spätzle processing  <cit> . thus we postulated a similarly important role for h. armigera sp <dig>  which needs further experimental verification.

while each csp harbors one or two regulatory modules at its amino terminus, clip-domain sphs , although lacking catalytic serine residue, act as cofactors for csp mediated reactions. in helicoverpa transcriptome,  <dig> csps  and  <dig> csphs  were identified . this number is more or less similar to b. mori  but much lower than that of d. melanogaster   <cit> , partly due to the lack of the corresponding genome information. multiple sequence alignment of the ten csp catalytic domains suggests that they all have a trypsin-like specificity, based on residues predicted to form the primary substrate binding site  . h. armigera csps and csphs are divided into four subfamilies based on their evolutionary relatedness . with similar sp subfamilies in other insects as well, these four groups of sp-related genes might represent lineages derived from ancient evolutionary events  <cit> . clipa is composed of csphs only. h. armigera csph <dig> of clipa is orthologous to t. molitor ppaf and holotrichia diomphalia ppaf <dig> and based on this orthology a putative function of csph <dig> as a cofactor of ppo can be predicted  <cit> . similarly, in clipb subfamily, csp <dig> and csp <dig> are orthologous to m. sexta pap <dig> and pap <dig> with  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity in amino acid sequences, respectively and may function as ppo activating protease  <cit> . structurally, csp <dig> harbors dual clip domains at its n-terminus, while csp <dig> only has one. csp <dig> and mspap <dig> were clustered together into a group which is close to but distinct from a clade comprising of dmmp <dig>  aaimp <dig>  aaimp <dig> and agclipb <dig> in phylogenetic analysis. on the other hand, csp <dig> was clustered together with mspap <dig> and bmppae into a clade distant and distinct from the above two clades. likewise, h. armigera csp <dig>  belonging to yet another independent clade within clipb subfamily, is orthologous to mshp <dig>  bmbaee and tmspe, suggesting its involvement in spätzle processing and toll pathway activation  <cit> . clipc includes four csps, of which csp <dig> forms an independent branch as that of m. sexta hp <dig> and d. melanogaster persephone. since m. sexta hp <dig> and hp <dig> constituted a branch leading to the cleavage of spätzle, h. armigera csp <dig> and csp <dig> are postulated to achieve the same function.figure  <dig> the clip-domain serine protease-related proteins  and serpins of h. armigera.  phylogenetic analysis of clips. the amino acid sequences of 12 h. armigera ,  <dig> d. melanogaster ,  <dig> b. mori , 3 m. sexta , 3 h. diomphalia ,  <dig> a. aegypti , and  <dig> a. gambiae  clips are compared and divided into four groups  based on sequence similarity. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site.  phylogenetic analysis of serpins. the amino acid sequences of  <dig> ha,  <dig> tc,  <dig> dm,  <dig> bm,  <dig> ms, and  <dig> am serpins are examined. the clade showing expansion compared with b. mori is shaded yellow. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site. the red dots at nodes denote bootstrap values greater than  <dig> from  <dig>  trials.



the ppo activation is delicately regulated by serpins. serpins are a superfamily of proteins, which have around 350– <dig> amino acid residues and the conserved tertiary structure comprising nine α-helices and three β-sheets  <cit> . most of them inhibit sp-mediated processes by forming covalent complexes with their cognate sps. the p <dig> residue at an exposed reactive site loop  near the carboxyl terminus determines its inhibitory selectivity. sequence similarity search of h. armigera unigenes yields  <dig> serpin transcripts, most of which have putative orthologs in b. mori . of these, sixteen serpins have a predicted signal peptide for secretion, while the rest  are assumed to be cytosolic . h. armigera serpin1- <dig> are highly similar to their m. sexta and b. mori orthologs, suggestive of their essential roles in regulating innate immunity  <cit> . one interesting feature of m. sexta and b. mori serpin <dig> and  <dig> is the mutual exclusive use of alternative exons to generate rsl variants on the same framework. while initial analysis suggests the same mechanism in h. armigera , a detailed study of serpin <dig> and  <dig> gene sequences will reveal the scope of this phenomenon. 1: <dig> orthologous relationship between h. armigera, b. mori, and m. sexta serpins <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> allowed us to make predictions about the putative functions of these haserpins as summarized below  <cit> . d. melanogaster spn27a, m. sexta serpin- <dig> and b. mori serpin <dig> are negative regulators of the melanization cascade. in the phylogenetic tree, h. armigera serpin <dig> was located in the same clade with them and also contained the conserved p2-p2′ sequence  . serpin <dig> may negatively regulate melanization and the activation of spätzle, while serpin <dig> and  <dig> might inhibit hemolymph csps regulating immune response in general . we predict their proteolytic cleavage site based on the multiple sequence alignment of the hypervariable rsls of the h. armigera serpins . serpin <dig> and  <dig> lack a conserved carboxyl-terminus and may not fold properly with a long insert separating the partial serpin domain. serpin <dig>   <dig> ~  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  may inhibit trypsin-like enzymes, while serpin- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ~  <dig>  are anticipated to inhibit chymotrypsin-like sps. only three serpins, serpin <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  contain val and met at the p <dig> position to control elastase-like enzymes. these predicted inhibitory activities and selectivity features surely need further experimental data to validate.

the immune signaling pathways and effector gene families
after recognizing the surface molecules of invading pathogens, recruited hemolymph immune factors would trigger signal transduction pathways and induce the production of effector molecules. similar to melanization, the toll pathway is also involved in the antifungal and antibacterial immunity. cleavage activated spätzle by drosophila spe  acts as the ligand for this pathway, binding to toll receptors and triggering its dimerization between leucine-rich repeats  <cit> . six spätzle  transcripts are present in the h. armigera transcriptome . the phylogenetic tree indicates h. armigera spz2 ~  <dig> are 1: <dig> orthologs of d. melanogaster spz2 ~  <dig>  h. armigera spz <dig> contained  <dig> cys residues at the same position to, perhaps form one interchain and four intrachain disulfide bonds. h. armigera csp <dig>  a trypsin-like enzyme, may cleave after r <dig> to activate the spätzle- <dig>  orthologous to b. mori and m. sexta spz1s with  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity, respectively and are grouped together in a lepidoptera specific branch in the phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . toll like receptors have also undergone significant diversification, with a total of  <dig> members in h. armigera transcriptome . they contain the entire orfs encoding extracellular leu-rich regions, transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic tir domains . the phylogenetic analysis supported the following orthologous relationship: dm9-ag9-ha9-bm <dig>  like d. melanogaster toll <dig>  <cit> , h. armigera toll- <dig>  may participate in the induced synthesis of antifungal proteins. h. armigera toll- <dig> and toll- <dig> may also play roles in immune signaling, as they both are in the same clade along with d. melanogaster toll <dig> and toll <dig>  although the toll pathway ligands and receptors have experienced major family expansions, the corresponding intracellular components, such as myd <dig>  tollip, tube, pelle, pellino and cactus, are mostly conserved in all the studied insects including h. armigera . our results suggested that these components formed a multimeric protein complex in h. armigera, which further phosphorylated hacactus resulting in the production of amps. the immune molecules involved in the anti-fungal and -bacteria pathways were conserved in the h. armigera .figure  <dig> the spätzles and toll-like receptors of h. armigera.  phylogenetic analysis of spätzle homologs. the amino acid sequences of  <dig> h. armigera , 4 t. castaneum ,  <dig> d. melanogaster ,  <dig> b. mori , 1 m. sexta ,  <dig> a. gambiae , and  <dig> a. mellifera  spätzles are compared. the red dots at nodes denote bootstrap values greater than  <dig> from  <dig>  trials. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site.  phylogenetic analysis of toll-like receptors from seven insect species. the amino acid sequences of  <dig> ha,  <dig> tc,  <dig> dm,  <dig> bm,  <dig> aa,  <dig> ag and  <dig> am toll-like receptors are examined. scale bar,  <dig>  substitutions per site.  schematic representations of the domain structure of h. armigera tolls. lengths of the amino acid sequences are indicated.



the insect imd pathway, analogous to the mammalian tnf signaling pathway, is critical for combating gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . imd protein itself is similar to mammalian tnf receptor as both contain a homologous death domain. activation of imd leads to the proteolytic cleavage of a rel family transcription activator, relish. the released active domain of relish is then translocated into the nucleus to exert its function  <cit> . the imd pathway components, including imd, dredd, fadd, tak <dig>  tab <dig>  ikk-β, ikk-γ and relish were all identified in the h. armigera transcriptome strongly suggesting the conservation of imd mediated immunity in cotton bollworm . additionally, two members of iap- <dig> were also identified. in d. melanogaster, iap- <dig> acts as a modulator of imd pathway aiding the nuclear localization of relish  <cit> .besides toll and imd pathways, jnk and jak/stat pathways are also implicated to play a role in insect immunity. activated by tak <dig> kinase, jnk pathways function through transcription factor relish resulting in production of amps in both a. gambiae and d. melanogaster  <cit> . one copy of jnk, hem, jun and fos genes of the jnk pathway were all identified in h. armigera transcriptome . in drosophila, jak/stat pathway controls the transcription of some immune molecules including teps, promotes phagocytosis and participates in antiviral response  <cit> . based on homology to d. melanogaster jak/stat pathway members, cytokine receptor domeless, hopscotch, and stat were present as single copy identified in h. armigera, indicating the conservation of this pathway . the negative regulators of jak/stat pathway, socs and pias, were found in the transcriptome as well. taken together, all these four pathways-toll, imd, jnk and jak/stat, coordinates in relaying the ‘danger’ signal ultimately stimulating the production of immune effector molecules .

most amps are low molecular weight  proteins forming amphiphilic α-helix, hairpin-like β-sheet, or structures stabilized by disulfide bonds  <cit> . induction of amps in fat body and hemocytes is thoroughly studied in lepidopteran insects including m. sexta and b. mori  <cit> . analysis of the h. armigera transcriptome revealed unigenes homologous to amps, including  <dig> lysozymes,  <dig> cecropins,  <dig> moricin,  <dig> gloverins,  <dig> defensin,  <dig> gallerimycin, and  <dig> lebocin . the number of annotated amps is much lower than that of b. mori  <cit>  and m. sexta  <cit> , probably due to the lack of genome information. while cecropins and defensins are found in various insects, moricins and gloverins are only reported to be present in lepidoptera. furthermore, four putative lysozyme transcripts are present in h. armigera transcriptome . lysozymes are 14– <dig> kda enzymes that hydrolyze peptidoglycans in bacterial cell wall  <cit> . all four h. armigera lysozymes belong to the c-type lysozymes with four disulfide bridges, and lysozymes 1– <dig> contain the conserved active site including the asp and glu residues. reactive oxygen and nitrogen species  played an important role in killing microbes and parasites  <cit> . however, the overproduction of free radicals can be toxic to the host cell, therefore a tight regulation of ros/rns concentration is required. superoxide dismutase , glutathione s-transferase , or peroxiredoxin converts ros/rns to less toxic product. here, we have annotated some of genes, including  <dig> gsts,  <dig> sods, and  <dig> peroxiredoxin transcripts , indicating that free radicals produced by ros and rns are likely to be components of the defense system in h. armigera. further experiments are needed to verify suggested role of the immune signaling pathways and effectors in h. armigera as described above.

expression profile of immunity-related genes in the fat body after fungal and bacterial infections
to verify the fpkm value changes between control and treatment groups, we performed quantitative real-time pcr analysis of the expression profiles of  <dig> genes in fat body and hemocytes from b. bassiana-, e cloacae- and buffer-injected h. armigera larvae. the results, consistent with the deep rna-seq data, provide an overview of tissue-specific gene expression patterns of h. armigera larvae in response to b. bassiana infection . this suggests the expression data of other genes from the rna-seq data analysis are also reliable.figure  <dig> expression patterns of the h. armigera immunity-related genes.  cluster analysis. expression profiles of immunity-related genes data are organized into three groups: recognition, signaling, and effectors. fat bodies and hemocytes are extracted from h. armigera larvae infected by bb  <dig> post infection and ec  <dig> post infection respectively. six datasets were included: fb_mock, fb_bb, fb_ec, hc_mock, hc_bb, hc_ec. gene families and functional pathways  are categorized within the group. gene names are shown on the right side.  quantitative real-time pcr analysis of the h. armigera immunity-related gene expression in hemocytes and fat body of the fifth instar larvae after b. bassiana  and e. cloacae  injection. h. armigera ribosomal protein s <dig>  was used as an internal standard to normalize the templates. the relative mrna levels are represented as the mean ± s.d. . *, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> . fb_mock, control fat body; fb_bb, fungus-induced fat body; fb_ec, bacterium-induced fat body; hc_mock, control hemocytes; hc_bb, fungus-induced hemocytes; hc_ec, bacterium-induced hemocytes.



humoral defense proteins are mainly produced and secreted by fat body, an insect tissue analogous to liver and adipose tissue of mammals in terms of immunity and metabolism. for prr genes, rna-seq based transcriptome analysis indicated that short pgrps  were induced in fat body after the fungal challenge. similarly, transcription of scr-b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  tep <dig>  tep <dig>  ctl <dig> ~  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ~  <dig> and galectins is up-regulated. this change is not limited to prrs, some signal transducers and regulators are also induced. cluster analysis of expression patterns revealed that csp <dig>   <dig> ~  <dig>  csph <dig>   <dig>  serpin <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> mrnas became much more abundant in fat body after the fungal challenge whereas higher levels of csp <dig> ~  <dig> and csp <dig> transcripts were detected in hemocytes. the pronounced up-regulation of toll pathway genes  occurred in fat body elicited by b. bassiana, suggesting their involvement in antifungal immunity. the gloverin <dig>  lysozyme <dig>  and lysozyme <dig> mrna levels increased most dramatically to defend the fungal infection. notably, most of these genes did not change sharply at transcript level in the other experiment conditions, indicating that fat body plays a major role in the antifungal response.

bacterial challenge also resulted in the activation of a broad spectrum of immunity-related genes. these include prrs such as ctls , signaling modulators , and effector molecules . the mrna abundances of fadd, fos, jnk significantly increased in fat body elicited by e. cloacae, as evidenced by  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig>  which were significantly up-regulated  in response to such bacterial infection. this number was apparently lower than that elicited by fungi, which is  <dig> . although more immunity-related genes were elicited by fungi  than bacteria , there is an overlap between them, including up-regulated csp <dig>  lysozyme <dig>  gloverin <dig> and hemolin, and down-regulated βgrp <dig> .

expression profile of immunity-related genes in hemocytes in response to fungal and bacterial challenges
hemocyte mediated defense reactions such as phagocytosis and encapsulation also depend on the recognition of foreign pathogens to trigger downstream immune signaling pathways. the expression profiles of immunity-related genes in hemocytes elicited by the pathogens were highly different from those in fat body. to better understand the complexity of responses of hemocytes against pathogens, the expression profile of immunity-related genes elicited by fungi and bacteria was compared. gene cohorts of cluster  <dig> include  <dig> such genes induced in b. bassiana induced hemocytes, including βgrp <dig>  βgrp <dig>  hemolin, csp <dig>  csp <dig>  serpin <dig>  serpin <dig>  lysozyme <dig>  lysozyme <dig> and so on. immune activation by e. cloacae is also noticeable as demonstrated by induction of prrs  and immune modulators .

thirty-three immunity-related genes in cluster  <dig> were significantly suppressed in b. bassiana elicited hemocytes. rna-seq based transcriptome analysis indicated that long pgrps  were strongly suppressed by b. bassiana but induced by e. cloacae. quantitative real-time pcr also revealed that the βgrp <dig> mrna level dramatically increased in hemocytes elicited by b. bassiana. in contrast, ctl mrna levels did not change significantly in hemocytes. the transcript levels of ppos were high in hemocytes, but significantly decreased in response to fungal challenge. likewise, components of the imd pathway , jnk and jak-stat pathways  were all dramatically suppressed in hemocytes in response to the fungal infection but moderately induced by bacterial infection, as validated by the quantitative real-time pcr assay of domeless, jak, and stat transcripts. this indicated that signal transduction in hemocytes responds differently to bacterial and fungal infection. more immunity-related genes were regulated by fungi  than bacteria  in hemocytes, and most of them tended to be suppressed .

although fat body and hemocytes both are important organs involved in the immune response, our transcriptome analysis revealed that more immunity-related genes are induced in fat body  than hemocytes . the expression of immune recognition and modulation molecules was mainly controlled in fat body, while genes involved in signal transduction, such as jak-stat and imd, were regulated more drastically in hemocytes . in toll pathway, hemocytes regulated toll- <dig>  toll- <dig>  toll- <dig>  tollip, cactus, and myd <dig>  but more other genes were regulatedin fat body. additionally, quantitative real-time pcr indicated that the transcription of putative pgrp-sa <dig>  pgrp-lb, toll- <dig> and spz <dig> genes were elevated in fat body upon b. bassiana infection, while the mrna levels of defensin, moricin and gloverin <dig> were up-regulated in hemocytes , which is consistent with the rna-seq results.

CONCLUSIONS
while many immunological studies are focused on b. mori and m. sexta, h. armigera, as a notorious lepidopteran pest affecting world agriculture, has not yet been systematically investigated on aspects of immunity until now. in order to develop and apply better pest control methods, we used high throughput sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of hemocytes and fat body in response to bacterial and fungal infection. the  <dig> immunity-related transcripts discovered are involved in recognition, signal transduction and modulation, and execution mechanisms. this number is certainly going to increase when its genomic information is available, based on the information acquired from this study, we can conclude that the repertoire of immunity-related genes is well conserved in h. armigera. moreover, we find that these genes displayed distinct mrna profiles in response to b. bassiana and e. cloacae infection. their products may constitute an integrated pathway of antifungal immunity, which provide valuable clues for further functional studies in h. armigera responding to b. bassiana, and pave the way for using h. armigera as a model system to study fungal-host interaction  <cit> . we have achieved another goal of using the transcriptome dataset to reveal tissue-specific gene expression patterns. the global patterns of hemocytes and fat body remarkably differ from each other after infection by the two microbes. furthermore, it is demonstrated that not only immunity-related genes but also metabolism genes are under the regulation of pathogen infection.

taken together, this study provided a global view of host defense gene expression profiles in response to bacterial and fungal challenges in a non-model insect. the results could benefit future in-depth study on the role of candidate genes involved in anti-fungal and -bacterial immunity, thereby helping improve the understanding of host-pathogen interactions and evolutionary history of immunogenetics from insects to mammals.
