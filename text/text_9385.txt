BACKGROUND
kawasaki disease  is a form of vasculitis that predominantly affects infants and toddlers, and specifically targets coronary arteries, resulting in increased risk of myocardial ischemia, heart disease and sudden death  <cit> . although most studies describe kd in japanese children, kd occurs in children of all ethnicities and geographic regions  <cit> . in the united states, kd remains the leading cause of acquired heart disease, affecting up to  <dig>  children each year  <cit> . research in kd etiology and pathogenesis addresses major knowledge gaps. there is a real need to identify novel therapeutic targets for kd since 25% of patients are resistant to intravenous immunoglobulin infusion , the most common and effective treatment for kd. moreover, the administration of ivig is quite expensive and used only for symptomatic patients  <cit> .

increasing clinical and experimental evidence suggests that abnormal immune responses to infectious agent are a key component of disease initiation  <cit> . the imbalanced immune response fueling kd is thought to encompass both the innate and adaptive immunity, as suggested by the elevation of pro-inflammatory mediators and increased activation of lymphocytes in kd patients  <cit> .

in this study, we used a coronary vasculitis model, based on the injection of a water-soluble fraction of candida albicans  in c57bl/6j mice   <cit> . in this model system, we investigated the inflammatory mediators, including chemokines and chemokine receptors, responsible for orchestrating leukocyte migration and other immune processes in the pathogenesis of a form of coronary vasculitis that resembles kd  <cit> . four lines of evidence suggested that the cc chemokine ligand  <dig>  – ccr <dig> axis would play a role in coronary vasculitis. first, ccr <dig> is required for monocyte/macrophage migration and activation  <cit> , a population of cells thought to promote tissue damage in kd  <cit> . second, previous reports indicated that there is marked up-regulation of chemokine ccl <dig>  <cit>  levels during the acute phase of kd for which the receptor is ccr <dig>  <cit> . third, evidence to the occurrence of kd is linked to common genetic variants in the chemokine receptor gene-cluster ccr3–ccr2–ccr <dig>  <cit> . finally, diverse experimental models implicate ccr <dig> in the establishment of tolerance or development of autoimmunity  <cit> . moreover increasing evidence points towards the loss of regulatory mechanisms , along with amplification of t cell driven inflammation , in kd  <cit> . our research highlights the critical role of ccr <dig> in the pathogenesis of coronary vasculitis seen in kd and identifies this chemokine receptor as an important determinant of the treg/th <dig> balance which may be critical for disease initiation and maintenance  <cit> .

RESULTS
ccr2−/− mice are protected against caws-induced vasculitis
we observed that injection of caws following the protocol described  induces vasculitis in the coronary arteries and aortic root  with histological changes that have been classified as granulomatous proliferative inflammation  <cit> . with this type of inflammation the normal structure of the arteries is destroyed . indeed in agreement with previous findings, there was a prominent infiltration of mononuclear cells, such as histiocytes, fibroblasts, etc., and neutrophils .

as previously described  <cit>  after caws injection we quantified vasculitis severity, by enumerating five anatomical sites at the level of the aortic root , as well as measuring the inflamed aortic wall area . understanding that incidence was defined as having one or more inflamed areas, 100% of ccr2+/+ mice developed coronary/aortic inflammation following caws injection compared to pbs controls and ccr <dig> null mice , had a mean of 4– <dig> areas inflamed in contrast to a mean of  <dig>  areas in ccr2−/− mice , and the area of inflammation was several folds higher .

highlighting the specificity of the protective phenotype afforded by ccr <dig> inactivation, 100% of ccr5−/− mice exposed to caws developed coronary vasculitis with the same area of inflammation seen in wild type mice ; and exhibiting only a small reduction in the number of affected areas .

decrease inflammatory infiltrate in the heart of ccr2−/− mice injected with caws
immunohistochemistry at the level of the aortic root revealed that caws-injected ccr2−/− mice had less macrophages present in the vessel wall compared with caws-injected ccr2+/+ mice, . also, compared with caws-injected ccr2+/+ mice, facs analysis of cell suspensions arising from the affected area  revealed that caws-injected ccr2−/− mice had significantly lower proportions of cd4+ t cells , neutrophils , inflammatory monocytes , and activated dendritic cells , . paralleling the results described above, myeloperoxidase  levels in caws-injected ccr2+/+ mice were significantly higher in serum from caws-injected mice, compared to pbs-injected mice . as expected, due to the milder vasculitis phenotype in ccr2−/− mice, serum mpo level post-injection in these mice was lower than in ccr2+/+ mice .

ccr2−/− t and b cells are partially sufficient for protection against caws-induced coronary vasculitis
supporting the contribution of adaptive immunity in caws-induced vasculitis, we found that mice lacking mature t and b lymphocytes  had a lower incidence  and decreased number of affected areas compared with wt mice . however, rag1−/− mice reconstituted with wt t and b cells had a similar phenotype as the wt mice . but most importantly, rag1−/− mice reconstituted with t and b cells from ccr2−/− mice had significantly lower incidence of caws-induced vasculitis  compared with wt mice .

looking at the phenotype of mice only lacking mature t cells  we found that compared with wt controls, nude mice had the same disease incidence and severity after caws administration .

caws administration in wt mice was linked to the elicitation of antibodies against mpo, anti-caws igg <dig>  and igg2a . interestingly, ccr2−/− mice that received caws administration had lower levels of potentially pathogenic anti-mpo antibodies, compared with wt mice . nevertheless, bringing into question the pathogenic role of anti-mpo and anti-caws antibodies, we found that similar to the wt mice , 100% of b cell-deficient mice  developed vasculitis, after caws administration . together, the data in figure  <dig> using rag1−/−, nude and igh−/−, suggest that t and b cells work together with the innate immune system to induce vasculitis, but neither cell type is indispensable for the induction of illness. the data also suggest that ccr <dig> modulates the role of t and b cells in the induction of vasculitis.

role of ccr <dig> in treg depletion and th <dig> expansion
to study the role of treg  in this model of aortic/coronary vasculitis after caws administration, we compared the circulating levels of treg in ccr2+/+ and ccr2−/− mice. we found that after two cycles of caws, the percentage of treg analyzed by facs were significantly increased in ccr2−/− compared to ccr2+/+ mice . having found that treg numbers were elevated after caws administration in ccr2−/−, we decided to evaluate if these quantities remained constant or changed between wt and ccr <dig> null mice before and after disease induction. examination of tregs at different time points including  <dig> days prior to injection of caws, as well as before and after the second caws cycle revealed that caws injection in ccr2+/+ mice resulted in a progressive reduction of tregs in circulation; however, we observed a significant increase of these cells in ccr2−/− mice after disease induction, and that these numbers remained elevated during the course of the disease in ccr2−/− compared to wt mice . interestingly, prior to caws injection, ccr2−/− mice had a significantly lower proportion of treg than ccr2+/+ mice in circulation .

similarly, there was a higher proportion of treg in the spleen of ccr2−/− mice compare to ccr2+/+ mice  <dig> days after completing two cycles of caws . substantiating this observation further, we found that compared with caws-injected ccr2+/+ mice, splenocytes from ccr2−/− mice stimulated with anti-cd3/cd <dig>  released higher levels of il- <dig>  and active tgf-β , cytokines that have been associated with treg. finally, there was an induction in the proportion of treg in circulation after disease initiation, as well as the cytokines involved in treg proliferation/differentiation, seen in ccr <dig> null mice. based on this observation we decided to investigate if the presence of treg in the locally affected areas  provided the protection seen in these animals compared to the wt. treg cells were not detected in the heart using flow cytometry  and rt-pcr  . these results indicate that most likely the suppression conferred by treg occurs distal to the inflamed regions .

conversely, caws-injected ccr2+/+ mice had a higher proportion of cd4+ and il-17a+ cells  in the spleen, compared with ccr2−/− mice . supporting the notion that an imbalance between treg and th <dig> consequently leads to coronary vasculitis, we found a significant negative correlation between the proportion of treg and th <dig> cells in the spleen . nevertheless, we also found a reduced th <dig> and th <dig> response in the spleens of caws- injected ccr2−/− mice , suggesting that increased treg in the spleens of ccr2−/− mice may be associated with broader modulation of t cell responses.

additionally, to determine the suppressor activity of treg in the context of ccr <dig>  functional assays were used in ccr2+/+ and ccr2−/− mice. treg from pbs-injected groups developed a clear suppressor activity characterized by decreased proliferation of responder cd4+ cells with different ratios. interestingly, a stronger suppressor activity was found in ccr <dig> intact mice under different ratios of responder cd4+ cells compared with the ccr <dig> null mice . using the first cycle of caws for development of coronary vasculitis , the same outcome was seen using a 1: <dig> proportion , no differences were found at 1: <dig>  and the opposite was found at 1: <dig> . finally, to compare the functional effect of ccr <dig> on the ability of treg to suppress proliferation, treg from ccr2+/+ or ccr2−/− mice were cultured with responder cd4+ t cells of the opposite genotype. notably, treg from ccr <dig> null mice showed a significant suppressor activity against ccr2+/+ responder t cells compared with regulatory t cells from ccr2+/+ with ccr2−/− responder cells at different ratios , indicating that absence of ccr <dig> can further enhance the suppressive capabilities of treg.

lastly, we evaluated a pharmacological approach to block ccr <dig> and its impact on the proportion of treg. for this, propagermanium  was used as a ccr <dig> blocker as has been demonstrated by yokochi et al.  <cit>  and others  <cit> . remarkably, oral administration of ppgm significantly increased the percentage of treg in circulation in ccr <dig> intact mice, compared to animals that did not receive treatment, following a trend similar to the one observed in ccr <dig> null mice  and confirming our previous findings.

decreased immune response in caws-injected ccr2−/− mice
in silico “pathways analysis” correlating ccr <dig>  th <dig>  and tregs pointed at il- <dig> as a molecular candidate linking the effect of ccl2-ccr2-dependent signals on the treg/th <dig> balance . therefore, we measured serum levels of il- <dig> in pbs- or caws-injected mice on days  <dig> and  <dig> after the first cycle of caws. the data revealed a systemic rise in the levels of il- <dig> in ccr2+/+ after caws injection that was ameliorated in ccr2−/− mice . in agreement with the serum data, culture supernatants of splenocytes activated with anti-cd3/cd <dig> from caws-injected mice contained higher levels of il- <dig> in ccr2+/+ compared with ccr2−/− mice . moreover, highlighting possible links between reduced il- <dig> production and lower proportion of th <dig> cells in the spleen, we found a significant correlation between circulating levels of il- <dig> and the percentage of th <dig> cells in the spleen across all groups of mice .

imo also called m <dig> monocytes is a subtype of monocytes thought to be an important cellular source of il- <dig>  <cit> . we found that caws injection resulted in mobilization of imo into the periphery, as indicated by over a two-fold increase in the proportion of imo in the blood and spleen of ccr2+/+ caws-injected compared to pbs injected mice . the proportion of imo in the bone marrow  of pbs injected ccr2−/−and ccr2+/+ mice was similar . however, caws injected ccr2−/− mice had a lower proportion of imo in the blood and spleen  than caws-injected ccr2+/+. together these data suggest that although ccr2−/− mice have a similar proportion of imo in the bm, these cells are not mobilized into periphery following the challenge with caws.

discussion
as seen in patients with kd, our murine model of coronary vasculitis was characterized mechanistically by the involvement of t and b cells  <cit>  as well as the mobilization of imo  <cit>  with an increase of il- <dig> levels  <cit> . moreover, treg/th <dig> cell imbalance was correlated with a reduction of il- <dig> and tgf-β together with an increase of il- <dig> after caws administration as in kd  <cit> . interestingly, genetic inactivation of ccr <dig>  but not ccr <dig>  is protective against caws induced-aortic and coronary vasculitis. several lines of evidence support our findings that ccr <dig> plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of coronary vasculitis as possibly seen in kd. first, ccl <dig> levels, one of the main ligands for ccr <dig>  are elevated in the serum  <cit>  and urine  <cit>  of patients with kd in the acute phase of illness; and this elevation is modulated by treatment  <cit> . also, genetic evidence points towards a role for ccr <dig> in the pathogenesis of kd, as suggested by the association between kd and common genetic variants in the chemokine receptor gene-cluster ccr3-ccr2-ccr <dig>  <cit> .

the role of lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages has been described as a key factor in the pathogenesis of kd  <cit> . also, in this study we show that t and b cells played a contributory role in the development of caws-induced vasculitis, as suggested by the decreased incidence of illness in rag1−/− mice. however, innate immune responses play a critical role as 50% of the rag1−/− mice still developed a less severe form of the illness. indeed, selective absence of b or t cells was not associated with significant protection, indicating that in this experimental model the interaction between these two cell types and the innate immune response provides a high degree of redundancy. in our study, the development of vasculitis was likely related to an imbalance between inflammation and immune regulation, triggered by innate immune factors such as il- <dig>  this cytokine has a pivotal function for dictating whether t cells differentiate into treg or th <dig> cells  <cit> . in the presence of tgf-β and il- <dig>  precursors differentiate into th <dig> cells, but when only tgf-β is present will they differentiate into treg  <cit> . thus, il- <dig> was likely to inhibit the generation of treg and induced the production of il- <dig>  a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. additionally, levels of mediators commonly released by treg, such as il- <dig> and tgf-β, were significantly elevated in ccr2−/− mice.

in caws-injected ccr2+/+ mice, we found a significant depletion of treg in the periphery that coincided with an increased proportion of th <dig> cells in the spleen and elevated circulating levels of il- <dig>  notably, ccr2−/− mice had lower circulating levels of il- <dig> compared to ccr2+/+ mice and interestingly; ccr2−/− mice had a higher proportion of circulating treg after caws. in addition, the important role of ccr <dig> to control treg function and proliferation in this model was uncovered by the fact that: i) ccr2−/− treg had a higher suppressor activity on wt responder t cells and ii) in-vivo blocking of ccr <dig> increased the proportion of treg in circulation.

collectively, these data suggested a mechanistic scenario by which this chemokine receptor was involved in the innate response to caws leading to the rise in il- <dig> production that favored a th <dig> cell response at the expense of treg.

three lines of evidence emphasize the importance of il- <dig> in kd and give credence to the notion that this mediator may be a determinant of the treg/th <dig> imbalance in the pathogenesis of coronary vasculitis  <cit> . first, higher levels of il- <dig> have been consistently reported in patients with kd during the acute phase of illness and serum levels of il- <dig> return to normal control levels following successful treatment and parallels the duration of the fever  <cit> .

second, comparable to our findings in wt mice injected with caws, which showed a sustained loss of treg, the proportion of treg is lower during acute kd and tends to normalize after the administration of ivig  <cit> . in addition, has been shown that ivig induces not only the expression of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ cells, but also the secretion of immunosuppressive tgf-β and il- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the protective phenotype related with ccr2−/− mice, was associated with an increase in regulatory t cells, tgf-β and il- <dig>  and a reduction of il- <dig> after caws administration.

finally, supporting the role for th <dig> responses in kd, serum il- <dig> levels has been shown markedly elevated in patients with acute kd and positively correlated with il- <dig> levels  <cit> . importantly, il- <dig> levels gradually decreased in the subacute phase  <cit> .

what was the cellular source of il- <dig> in mice injected with caws? in line with our findings in the caws-induced vasculitis, a growing consensus exists that one of the main pathogenic factors in kd is the activation of monocytes/macrophages  <cit> . for instance, during the acute phase, patients with kd have a significant increase in the absolute numbers of cd14+ monocytes  <cit> , as well as in the percentage of cd14+cd16- monocytes, the human correlate of mouse imo. this increase is quite specific to kd and severe bacterial infections, but not to other febrile illness such as pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, or anaphylactoid purpura  <cit> . cd14+cd16- cells also trigger efficient immune responses  <cit> . both, in humans and mice, imo release high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including il- <dig>  <cit> . imo are directly influenced by ccr <dig> i.e., cell activation, and indirectly, i.e., regulation of cell migration  <cit> . we found that caws injection promoted a ccr2-dependent emigration of imo from the bm to periphery . increased availability of imo in the periphery creates a readily available cellular source of il- <dig>  these findings were not unexpected considering the elegant work from serbina et al., and others  <cit> , indicating that ccr <dig> is required for the emigration of imo from the bm into the periphery.

some limitations need to be considered. first, no animal model can recapitulate all the features of kd, including age of onset  <cit> . second, the assessment of t cell responses in peripheral blood of patients with kd or in the spleen of caws-injected mice prove informative; and the ongoing t cells dynamics that may be present in kd at the vascular wall, may not fully parallel our model, where we see a systemic ongoing immune activation. additional experiments are needed to directly demonstrate the role for il- <dig>  treg and th <dig> in caws-induced vasculitis via antibody neutralization, genetic inactivation or cell expansion/depletion.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the role of ccr <dig> in the pathogenesis of vasculitis as seen in kd and other types of vasculitis, and highlighting novel therapeutic targets specifically for individuals resistant to first-line treatments.
