BACKGROUND
the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  is the most sensitive method for the detection of specific mrnas  <cit> . however, due to the exponential nature of the pcr amplification process, small differences in amplification efficiency among samples may led to very different product yields, making rt-pcr unsuitable for quantitative purposes. the use of exogenously added standard sequences as internal competitors has overcome partially this issue  <cit> , but the setting up of the system must be done for each target sequence taking into account multiple error sources  <cit> , making competitive pcr unsuitable for high-throughput applications. the recent introduction of fluorescence techniques and instruments able to quantify the dna content in each cycle had lead in the last years to the development of real-time pcr  <cit> . because the high sensitivity of fluorescent product detection, real-time pcr does not rely on end-point analyses. moreover, cycle-by-cycle data generated by real-time pcr provides information about the kinetics of the amplification process, overcoming the limitations of classical rt-pcr. recently, the introduction of double-stranded dna specific dyes  <cit>  allowed the quantification of multiple targets without the need of specific fluorescent probes, making real-time pcr a popular method for microarray data validation  <cit> .

most currently used real-time pcr data analysis methods are based on determining the threshold cycle , which is the cycle number at which a fixed amount of product is formed  <cit> . the comparative ct method, a broadly used semi-quantitative one, is based on the exponential description of the pcr process assuming constant amplification efficiency equal to  <dig>  <cit> . however, in our applications of sybr-green i real-time pcr, we have found amplification efficiency always lower that  <dig>  moreover, it has been shown that a difference as small as 4% in pcr efficiency could be translated to 400% error in comparative ct method based quantifications  <cit> . thus, reliable quantitative real-time pcr depends on good estimations of pcr efficiency. several methods have been proposed for amplification efficiency estimation. one of them uses a dilution curve to estimate the amplification efficiency of each target sequence  <cit> , while the others estimate the amplification efficiency from single reaction data  <cit> . here we introduce a new mathematical model based on the classic exponential description of the pcr, in which amplification efficiency was modelled as a sigmoid function of the product yield. the model was validated with experimental data and it was used for the development of a new method for real-time pcr data analysis. this model based method for real-time pcr data analysis  estimates pcr amplification efficiency from single sample reaction data, eliminating the need of calibration curves, which is a drawback for high-throughput implementations  <cit> . moreover, mobpa showed the highest accuracy and precision compared with previous methods when used for quantification of samples amplified with similar or dissimilar efficiency.

RESULTS
the model
according to its discrete nature, the pcr process can be expressed by the difference equation,

tn+ <dig> = tn·;     en ∈      

where tn is the pcr product yield at cycle n, and e is the amplification efficiency of the reaction. in a previous work, we have modelled the amplification efficiency as a linear function of the product yield   <cit> . however, a recent kinetic description of the real-time pcr showed a sigmoid relationship between the effective amplification efficiency and the product yield, either whether primer, nucleotides or dna polymerase become limiting  <cit> . this prompted us to evaluate two additional empirical models describing the amplification efficiency as a function of pcr product yield: a three parameters, and a two parameters sigmoid models . both models imply that the amplification efficiency change dynamically also during the exponential phase, which is in agreement with the work of liu, et.al  <cit> . however, our models differ from the sigmoid description of the pcr reaction, because we model the amplification efficiency as a function of the product yield, instead of describing it as a function of the cycle number. the models were fitted to the same real-time pcr dataset comprising  <dig> pcr reactions, with initial target amount spanning  <dig> orders of magnitude and ct values that range from  <dig> to  <dig> . despite the fact that the three models explained more than 95% of the data variance, only models  <dig> and  <dig> showed a random distribution of residuals . to identify the best way of describing the amplification efficiency, we compared the models using a corrected form of akaike's information criterion   <cit> . model  <dig> aic value was lower than model  <dig> and  <dig> . thus, the following two parameters sigmoid expression for e was used through this work,

model based estimation of the initial template amount 
in dsdna binding dye protocols, real-time thermocyclers generate fluorescence intensity data. for most applications in which the dsdna binding dye is in great excess, it can be assumed that the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the amount of double stranded dna   <cit> . however, it has been shown that this is not always the case  <cit> . our model parameters are fitted with fluorescence intensity data, thus the product yield  will be expressed in arbitrary fluorescent units, as the initial template amount . since the fluorescent dye will be in great excess when compared to the initial template amount, we can assume that t <dig> is proportional to the initial template amount, and so the semiquantitative comparison between different samples using t <dig> is valid.

the simplest way to estimate t <dig> is assuming that amplification efficiency at cycle ct  is very similar to ei. this assumption is usually correct because ct is defined at small amounts of pcr product. then, solving eq.  for n = ct and assuming constant amplification efficiency we obtain:

tct = t <dig> ct     

from which,

t <dig> = tct -ct     

ei can be estimated from eq. , and the efficiency parameters b and tm can be obtained fitting eq.  to real-time pcr data by non-linear regression . then, t <dig> is calculated assuming e = ei. since eq.  is a power function of the amplification efficiency, small errors in the estimation of ei can be translated to strong errors in t <dig> estimation. these errors can be minimized using ct values as small as possibly, and estimating the amplification parameters with pooled data from replicates to improve ei estimation accuracy. replicates must be done by splitting a master-mix containing all components of the pcr to minimize the variability introduced be the operator.

to test this method, we amplified three serial dilutions of cdna from mouse midbrain with β-actin specific primers. pooled data from triplicate experiments were used for ei estimation, which were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for dilutions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. estimations of t <dig> from this data were accurate and precise for ct values calculated from small pcr product yields, but led to different absolute quantification results for higher ct values . however, since amplification efficiencies are similar, the relative error of quantifications was independent of the product yield at which the ct was calculated . to test the performance of the ct method when amplification efficiencies are not the same, we amplified the same amount of mouse midbrain cdna with β2-microglobulin specific primers, but using different amounts of taq dna polymerase . amplification efficiencies estimated with our approach from triplicate results were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for  <dig>  and  <dig>  units of taq dna polymerase, respectively. then, an increase of only 7% in amplification efficiency led to errors in the quantifications that were directly related to the pcr product yield at which the ct was calculated .

we formulated an alternative more robust method for t <dig> estimation that does not rely on product threshold determinations. this alternative method is based on the fit of eq.  and  to real-time pcr data by non-linear regression to obtain the best-fit estimators for the parameters b, tm and t <dig>  this approach does not assume constant amplification efficiency and estimates t <dig> from all the data points that fall into the exponential-linear growth phase instead of using only the product yield at cycle ct. analysis of experimental results showed that t <dig> estimations were precise and accurate . however, fitting the model to experimental data showed a strong correlation between t <dig> and both model  <dig> parameters b and tm. this means that experimental data do not define the model unambiguously, leading to large uncertainty in the estimation of t <dig> . to overcome this problem, we propose a two-step procedure called model-based method for real-time pcr data analysis . in the first step of the mobpa procedure, we obtain good estimators for b and tm parameters by fitting model  <dig>  to experimental data. in the second step, we replace b and tm in eq.  <dig> with the values estimated in step  <dig>  and then fit eq.  <dig> to experimental data to obtain a good estimator for t <dig>  t <dig> estimations by mobpa were as precise and accurate as using the ct method for small pcr product yield-derived ct values , and the asymptotic standard errors were approximately  <dig> fold smaller .

estimation of t <dig>  b and tm by fitting eq.  and  to experimental data , and estimation of t <dig> by fitting eq.  and  to experimental data using b and tm values previously obtained from the fit of eq.  to experimental amplification efficiencies . shown is the dilution of mouse midbrain cdna used for each real-time pcr run, the best fit values for t <dig>  the asymptotic estimation of the standard error , and the t <dig> mean value ± standard error of the mean . for , the correlation between t <dig> and the other parameters estimated by non-linear regression is also shown.

comparison of mobpa with previous methods
next, we evaluated the performance of different methods for quantification when amplification efficiency for different samples is not the same. for this, we analysed two different datasets: 1) in-silico generated data of real-time pcr runs starting at the same initial template amount but differing in their intrinsic amplification efficiency; and 2) real experimental data obtained by amplifying the same amount of mouse midbrain cdna with β2-microglobulin specific primers, but with different amounts of taq dna polymerase .

simulation data was generated in-silico from eqs.  and , using parameters that resemble real pcr runs. results from amplification of mouse midbrain cdna with β-actin and β2-microglobulin specific primers were used to estimate plausible values for the simulation parameters. the analysis of these simulation results must be taken with care, because we used the same model for generating and fitting the data, so some overfitting is expected. however, we also evaluated the performance of the different methods on real pcr data. to obtain different amplification efficiency in our pcr runs, we used two different amount of dna polymerase. efficiencies estimated with our approach from triplicate results were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for  <dig>  and  <dig>  units of taq dna polymerase, respectively. the use of more than  <dig>  units of dna polymerase did not led to additional increments in amplification efficiency, while pcr with less that  <dig>  units of dna polymerase showed no product. we also tried to partially reduce the pcr amplification efficiency by adding mg2+ chelating agents like edta, by increasing the amount of dntps, by lowering the amount of mg2+, and by adding known dna polymerase inhibitors like phenol. however, we could not find the appropriate conditions to achieve the partial inhibition of dna polymerase in a reproducible way.

both in-silico and experimental real-time pcr data were analysed with different methods. the simpler and widespread used methods are based on ct value determinations, assuming constant amplification efficiency during the exponential phase of the pcr and among different samples  <cit> . then, from eq.  is easy to solve the initial template amount ratio between two samples as:

where t <dig> is the initial template amount, e is the amplification efficiency, and cti the threshold cycle for each sample. the simplest form of threshold-based methods even assumes amplification efficiency equal  <dig>  thus, the ratio of initial template amounts between two samples will be 2Δct  <cit> . because of the exponential nature of this expression, amplification efficiencies below  <dig> will lead to unreliable quantifications. amplification efficiency below  <dig> is frequent and indeed, most of our real-time pcr reactions showed amplification efficiencies between  <dig>  and  <dig> . to overcome this limitation, a dilution series based method for amplification efficiency estimation has been developed  <cit> . a curve is constructed by amplification of serial dilutions of one reference sample and plotting the resulting ct values against the base  <dig> logarithm of the dilution factor. assuming constant amplification efficiency between dilutions and over the number of thermocycles required to reach ct, the amplification efficiency can be obtained from eq.  as e = 10-1/slope- <dig>  however, sample contamination with salt, phenol, chloroform, etc. may result in a lower-than-expected pcr efficiency  <cit> . dilution of this sample will also dilute the contaminant decreasing its effect on the pcr reaction, thereby increasing the pcr efficiency with each dilution step. indeed, we usually observe such dilution effect on pcr amplification efficiency, see for example data presented in fig. 2a, in which estimated efficiency from the dilution series was  <dig> , while estimations of the intrinsic amplification were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for dilutions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. amplification efficiency estimations from such dilution series will be inaccurate, introducing a bias in the quantification. moreover, contaminants can quantitatively and qualitatively differ between samples, thus, the assumption of equal amplification efficiencies between samples can lead to strong errors in quantifications.

analysis of in-silico pcr results showed that the bias in quantifications by these methods is directly related to the difference in amplification efficiency between templates. in such a way, a 20% difference in amplification efficiency leaded to  <dig> and  <dig>  fold bias in quantifications depending on whether efficiency  <dig> or reference sample efficiency  was used for calculations . accordingly, the quantification of β2-microglobulin was 86% and 74% overestimated by the use of efficiency  <dig> or  <dig>  in threshold-based methods, respectively . despite the poor accuracy of these methods, t <dig> estimation from replicated samples was very precise , possibly because these approaches are only affected by errors in ct estimation. similar precision was obtained with experimental real-time pcr results , and it was previously reported by other authors  <cit> .

four different methods for single reaction amplification efficiency estimation have been proposed. all of them use the kinetic data generated by real-time pcr cyclers, they do not assume equivalent amplification efficiency among samples and have the additional advantage that no dilutions curve is needed. three of them assume constant amplification efficiency during the exponential phase of the pcr and estimate it from the few data points that fall into this phase  <cit> . the simplest one is based on the product yield measured at two thresholds along the exponential phase of the pcr, from which the amplification efficiency is estimated as e = 1/ -  <dig>  <cit> . then, the initial template amount is calculated from eq. . based on the same model for the pcr reaction, ramakers et. al. proposed the use of all the points of the background subtracted and logarithm transformed pcr data that fall into a "window-of-linearity", for amplification efficiency estimation by linear regression  <cit> . recently, tichopad et.al. introduced a similar approach based on a new statistical method for the identification of the exponential phase and estimation of amplification efficiency by non-linear regression  <cit> . analysis of in-silico generated results with different amplification efficiencies showed better accuracy of these three approaches when compared with the threshold-based methods, since they introduced only  <dig>  –  <dig>  fold bias in quantifications . however, since t <dig> determinations depend on both efficiency and ct estimations, precision in quantification of replicates was very poor . indeed, quantification of samples that differ less than 10% in amplification efficiency were more accurate when analysed with the pfaffl or efficiency  <dig> threshold-based methods  <cit> , most likely due to the poor precision of single reaction based efficiency estimations. these observations were further confirmed with experimental real-time pcr data .

recently, liu et.al. proposed a three parameters sigmoidal function for modelling the whole kinetic process of real-time pcr. then, the initial template amount is estimated after fitting the sigmoidal model to background subtracted real-time pcr results  <cit> . analysis of in-silico pcr results showed a good accuracy and moderate precision of this method for most pcr simulations, with a fold bias <  <dig>  and a mean cv of 12%  . however, the model presented systematic deviations from the data that were particularly noted with amplification efficiencies above  <dig> , both with experimental and in-silico generated data. these deviations had a strong effect on t <dig> estimation, leading to unreliable quantifications . similar deviations were recently described in the plateau phase by rutledge, who showed that elimination of these data points improve the accuracy of this method  <cit> .

finally, quantification from the same in-silico and experimental real-time pcr results with our model based approach showed the highest accuracy and precision. analysis of in-silico data showed that 20% difference in amplification efficiency between samples only led to  <dig>  fold bias, with a mean cv of only  <dig> %  . moreover, an increase of 7% in experimental real-time pcr amplification efficiency only led to 13% under-estimated quantification  .

to test the reliability of the different methods in conditions of similar amplification efficiency between samples, we amplified three dilutions of mouse midbrain cdna with β-actin specific primers. among threshold-based methods, the use of amplification efficiency estimated for each experiment from the dilution series  <cit>  produced the best results . most methods for the estimation of amplification efficiency from single reaction results introduced strong deviations in the quantification. only the approach suggested by tichopad et.al.  <cit>  showed moderate deviations . similar observation have been reported by peirson et.al., who showed that estimation of amplification efficiency from single reactions data introduces systemic errors and increases the assay noise  <cit> , suggesting that these methods should be used only when the amplification efficiency between samples is not the same. a statistical method for the detection of samples with dissimilar efficiencies, called kinetic outlier detection , was recently developed  <cit> . kod method can be used to decide whether to use single reaction or global amplification efficiency estimated from dilution series for quantifications. to note, our model based approach gave the most accurate and precise results, which were similar to the ones produced by pfaffl approach  <cit>  , indicating that mobpa produce reliable quantifications no matter whether samples are amplified with similar or different efficiency.

 our model based real-time pcr analysis method .

our model assumes that the signal is proportional to the amount of product, which is often the case for sybr-green i real-time pcr performed with saturating concentrations of dye. in such conditions centrally symmetric amplification curves are expected. however, in taqman applications, where the taq dna polymerase digests a probe labelled with a fluorescent reporter and quencher dye, the signal diverges from the product resulting in non-symmetric amplification curves   <cit> . to test whether our approach is also suitable for taqman data analysis, we quantified β-actin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase  in 1/ <dig> dilutions of the same cdna sample using taqman probes. the error of quantifying a 10-fold concentrated sample was only slightly higher using taqman when compared to sybr-green i . these results suggest that mobpa is robust enough to deal with non-symmetric amplification curves, possibly because it makes use of only the data points that fall into the exponential-lineal growth phases of the pcr.

CONCLUSIONS
following the emergence of functional genomic methodologies, the development of high-throughput methods for microarray-derived data validation is becoming indispensably. nevertheless, high-throughput quantification by real-time pcr is difficult to achieve, primarily due to deficiencies of the threshold-based methodologies, which require reliable estimation of amplification efficiencies  <cit> . in addition to the technical challenge of generating dilution curves for each target sequence, these methods assume similar amplification efficiencies between samples, and this assumption has been reported to be invalid  <cit> . here we introduce a new method for the analysis of real-time pcr results termed: model based method for real-time pcr data analysis . the new method produced the most accurate and precise quantifications when compared to previous methods regardless of whether samples were amplified with similar or different amplification efficiencies. moreover, no calibration curve is needed for quantifications, since amplification efficiency is estimated directly from real-time pcr data. mobpa provides many of the fundamental capabilities required for fully automated high-throughput quantification  <cit> , including routine assessment of amplification efficiency within individual samples and no need of pcr-generated standard curves. in addition, quantitative data can be easily derived from arbitrary fluorescence units, simply applying a calibration factor that relates fluorescence to dna mass  <cit> . in conclusion, mobpa combines the well accepted exponential model of the pcr reaction with a sigmoid description of amplification efficiency to obtain a powerful method for real-time pcr data analysis that expand the applicability of real-time pcr to fully automated high-throughput applications.
