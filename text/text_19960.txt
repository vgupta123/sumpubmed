BACKGROUND
the rna interference  pathway is an innate immune pathway of invertebrates such as nematodes, trypanosomes, hydra, planaria, and insects  <cit> . in mosquitoes, the rnai pathway has been shown to act as an antiviral immune pathway that is able to effectively modulate the replication pattern of arthropod-borne viruses   <cit> . it has been postulated that rnai functions as a gatekeeper in mosquitoes, modulating arbovirus replication to allow virus transmission but preventing virus concentrations that could lead to fitness costs and pathogenic effects  <cit> . consequently, rnai is potentially a major factor determining the vector competence of mosquitoes for arboviruses.

sindbis virus  is an arbovirus with a positive sense single-stranded rna genome. a dsrna intermediate is formed during replication, which triggers the rnai pathway causing homology-dependent destruction of viral rna  <cit> .  since sinv is able to establish persistent infections in the mosquito, the virus must have developed strategies to cope with the antiviral rnai pathway in the insect host. potential rnai evasion strategies for alphaviruses are active suppression of the rnai pathway and - similar to flaviviruses - sequestration of the dsrna replicative intermediate within cellular membrane structures  <cit> . under natural conditions, sinv circulates between culex sp. and birds with humans acting as dead end hosts  <cit> . however, in the laboratory the virus is transmissible by the well characterized mosquito vector aedes aegypti, prompting researchers to use the sinv-ae. aegypti combination as a model to study arbovirus-mosquito interactions at the molecular level. after ingestion of a viremic bloodmeal by a competent mosquito, sinv enters midgut epithelial cells and begins replicating  <cit> . from the midgut the virus disseminates to secondary tissues such as muscles surrounding the alimentary tract, fat body, hemocytes, nerve tissue, and finally salivary glands. once sinv enters the saliva, the virus has completed its extrinsic incubation period and the mosquito is able to transmit the virus to a new host  <cit> . the tr <dig> strain of sinv is based on a consensus sequence derived from the type strain ar <dig> that has been isolated in egypt  <cit> . for this study, we used a full-length infectious cdna clone of the virus with the enhanced green fluorescent protein  marker gene inserted downstream of a second subgenomic promoter  <cit> . after ingestion by females of the ae. aegypti rexd strain, sinv-tr <dig> has been shown to encounter an escape barrier in the midgut ; whereas reported midgut infection rates were >90%, dissemination rates only reached 40%  <cit> .

midgut infection barrier  and/or meb have been observed for a number of other alphaviruses and for flaviviruses  <cit> . mib prevents ingested arboviruses from entering and replicating in mesenteronal  cells, whereas meb prevents virions from escaping from the basal lamina of midgut cells and disseminating to other tissues in the hemocoel. often these barriers depend on the amount of virus ingested by the mosquito because the virus has to reach a certain threshold to either establish an infection in the midgut or to disseminate to other tissues  <cit> . furthermore, dose-independent mib or meb have been reported, implying an incompatibility between arbovirus and vector at the midgut level, thus preventing arboviruses from entering or exiting the epithelial cells  <cit> . until now, the molecular nature of mib and meb, which appears to depend on specific virus-mosquito strain combinations, is not well understood. however, recent correlation analysis of rnai pathway genes with mib and meb combined with linkage mapping of aa-dcr <dig>  aa-r2d <dig>  and aa-ago <dig> genes in the genome of ae. aegypti suggests that mib and meb for dengue virus could be rnai associated phenomena  <cit> .

to investigate the nature of mib and meb for sinv-tr339egfp in ae. aegypti, we impaired the rnai pathway in the mosquito midgut at a time point when the ingested virus is replicating in cells of the midgut epithelium. we expected that impairment of the rnai pathway in the midgut of ae. aegypti would allow the virus to overcome potential mib and/or meb and to increase its overall titer in the insect. we chose a transgenic approach to impair the rnai pathway in the midgut of ae. aegypti by generating mosquitoes expressing an inverted-repeat  rna derived from the rnai pathway gene aa-dcr <dig> under control of the bloodmeal inducible, midgut-specific ae. aegypti carboxypeptidase a  promoter  <cit> . according to our strategy the midgut-specific ir effector would produce dsrna in bloodfed females, triggering rnai against aa-dcr <dig> and eventually causing depletion of dicer <dig> protein in the midgut. this would cause impairment of the rnai pathway in this tissue. previously, it has been demonstrated that homology-dependent silencing of dcr <dig> can impair the rnai mechanism in insect cells and in ae. aegypti  <cit> .

the objectives of this study are to generate transgenic ae. aegypti mosquitoes with an impaired rnai pathway in midgut tissue after ingestion of a bloodmeal, to assess vector competence of the transgenic mosquitoes for sinv-tr339egfp with respect to possible effects on mib and meb, and to evaluate if midgut-specific impairment of the rnai pathway reduces the survival rate of sinv-infected mosquitoes.

RESULTS
generation of transgenic ae. aegypti expressing an ir rna targeting aa-dcr <dig> mrna
we designed a donor plasmid based on the mariner mos <dig> transposable element  containing an aa-dcr <dig> ir expression cassette under control of the bloodmeal inducible, midgut-specific aecpa promoter . the donor plasmid was co-injected with a helper plasmid expressing the mos <dig> transposase  <cit>  into  <dig> pre-blastoderm embryos of the ae. aegypti hwe strain. the survival rate was  <dig> %. after outcrossing to the hwe recipient strain,  <dig> g <dig> families were established and their offspring  were screened for eye-specific egfp expression. we selected  <dig> different mosquito families that produced transgenic offspring, carb/dcr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

levels of aa-dcr <dig> silencing among the transgenic ae. aegypti lines
as an initial molecular characterization we analyzed aa-dcr <dig> mrna expression in midguts of nine of the  <dig> transgenic lines after bloodfeeding by quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr . line carb/dcr <dig> was eventually lost during mosquito rearing. one week post-emergence females of the nine lines were bloodfed on mice. relative aa-dcr <dig> mrna accumulation was reduced by >50% in mosquito midguts of lines carb/dcr <dig> and carb/dcr <dig> at day  <dig> post-bloodmeal  as compared to sugarfed control mosquitoes . for lines carb/dcr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  relative levels of aa-dcr <dig> mrna reduction were between 10-45%. on the contrary, for lines carb/dcr <dig>   <dig>  and the non-transgenic hwe control relative aa-dcr <dig> mrna levels were increased in mosquito midguts. based on the aa-dcr <dig> mrna expression profile of carb/dcr <dig> females, we selected this line for further vector competence studies with sinv-tr339egfp.

characterization of the transgene integration site in carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes
the transgene integration site in the genome of carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes was defined by genome walking. we confirmed the stable integration of the mos <dig> based transgene into the genome of hwe mosquitoes by the fact that dna sequences flanking the left and right arms of the te were continuous . the te integration site is in a non-protein encoding region at nucleotide position  <dig>  of contig  <dig>  supercontig  <dig> . absence of any other sequences from the genome walking libraries strongly suggests that integration of the te occurred as a single copy.

phenotypic analysis of sinv-tr339egfp
the  <dig> base-pair coding sequence of the egfp gene was inserted into a recombinant cdna clone of sinv-tr <dig>  the marker gene was placed under control of the engineered, duplicated subgenomic promoter that was located upstream of the sequence encoding the viral structural genes. growth curve analysis of sinv-tr339egfp in vero cells revealed an increase in virus titer from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml between  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection . then the titer gradually decreased to  <dig> ×  <dig> at  <dig> h post-infection. the pattern of the growth curve was similar to that observed for the tr <dig> strain of sinv lacking a duplicated subgenomic promoter  <cit> . furthermore, strong egfp expression was observed among the cells at  <dig> h post-infection. however, in sinv-tr339egfp infected tissue such as the mosquito midgut, egfp expression was often rather low even though virus titers proved to be relatively high . this observed discrepancy between viral marker gene expression and actual titers prompted us in the following experiments to base sinv-tr339egfp detection in mosquitoes on intensity of infection rather than visualization of egfp expression.

evaluation of transgene expression and aa-dcr <dig> mrna levels in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> females
detection of a single rna band corresponding to a size of ~ <dig> nt by northern blot analysis showed that aa-dcr <dig> derived ir rna was transcribed in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> females 18- <dig> h after receiving a non-infectious bloodmeal . a similar signal was not detected at a later time point or in midguts of sugarfed carb/dcr <dig> females and in the hwe control. this temporal and spatial expression pattern was in agreement with those observed for other transgenes controlled by the aecpa promoter  <cit> . hybridization signal intensities for aa-dcr <dig> mrna among midgut rna of bloodfed carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes were considerably weaker at 18- <dig> h pbm compared to those of bloodfed hwe at similar time points . this indicates silencing of the rnai pathway gene in midguts of the bloodfed transgenic mosquitoes. in addition, we assessed the aa-dcr <dig> mrna expression profile for carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes during one week by qrt-pcr. aa-dcr <dig> expression in midguts of bloodfed females followed a wave-like pattern with lowest expression in the transgenic line at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pbm and maximal expression at day  <dig> pbm . accumulation of aa-dcr <dig> mrna was reduced in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> females as compared to the hwe control with the exception of day  <dig> pbm, a time point when the transgene was no longer expressed. we observed that aa-dcr <dig> expression profiles were generally less elevated in carb/dcr <dig> and hwe mosquitoes that had received an artificial bloodmeal containing defibrinated sheep blood than in mosquitoes that had been allowed to feed on mice . after ingestion of a bloodmeal containing sinv-tr339egfp , aa-dcr <dig> mrna levels in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> and hwe followed a similar wave-like pattern. aa-dcr <dig> mrna accumulation was substantially increased in carb/dcr <dig> and hwe mosquitoes during the one week observation even though the overall level of aa-dcr <dig> mrna was still lower in the transgenic females than in hwe. this suggests that replicating sinv-tr339egfp has triggered the rnai pathway in the mosquito midgut.

effects of aa-dcr <dig> silencing in the midgut of carb/dcr <dig> females on intensity of sinv-tr339egfp infection, infection rate, and dissemination in an initial experiment
to test whether midgut-specific silencing of aa-dcr <dig> affects the vector competence for sinv-tr339egfp, infection intensities and virus infection and dissemination rates were evaluated in carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes. in an initial experiment , midgut infection rate and intensity of virus infection were significantly higher in carb/dcr <dig> than in hwe mosquitoes at  <dig> days pbm . we observed that 21/ <dig> carb/dcr <dig> females were infected with a ~1300-fold higher mean virus titer than the hwe control. in contrast, only 2/ <dig> hwe mosquitoes had measurable virus infection in their midguts. accordingly, 53% of the remaining mosquito bodies of carb/dcr <dig> females were infected with sinv at  <dig> days pbm, whereas no hwe carcasses showed any detectable infection. this indicates that midgut infection rate and intensity affect the dissemination potential of the virus to secondary tissues. however, at  <dig> days pbm the overall sinv infection patterns of carb/dcr <dig> females were no longer significantly different from those of the hwe control. these results suggest that sinv-tr339egfp encountered mib and meb in hwe mosquitoes at  <dig> days pbm, whereas in the rnai-impaired carb/dcr <dig> females these barriers were not evident.

effects of aa-dcr <dig> silencing in the midgut of carb/dcr <dig> females on mean intensities of sinv-tr339egfp infection, infection and dissemination rates
to confirm this observation, we repeated the experiment three more times and assessed mean intensity of sinv infection and midgut infection rates. to reveal mean midgut dissemination rates for the virus, two additional replicates of the experiment were analyzed. sinv-tr339egfp titers in the bloodmeals ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml. the mean intensity of virus infection in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> females  was >8-fold higher than in the control at  <dig> days pbm, which was highly significant . similarly, in the remaining mosquito bodies the difference between hwe and carb/dcr <dig> females was statistically significant. in contrast, mean intensities of sinv-tr339egfp infection did not differ significantly between the transgenic strain and the hwe control at  <dig> days pbm. at this time point however, virus titers were reduced by 83% in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes as compared to seven days earlier. this effect was observed only in the rnai-impaired carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes. since sinv titers of carcasses were not increased at  <dig> days pbm as compared to  <dig> days pbm, we assume that reduction in the intensity of virus infection in midguts was not caused by virus dissemination to secondary tissues.

the mean midgut infection rate with sinv-tr339egfp was significantly higher among carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes  than among the hwe control  at  <dig> days pbm . as the standard error in fig. 4a predicts, midgut infection rates of the hwe mosquitoes had a relatively high variability between experiments. clearly, in the rnai-impaired carb/dcr <dig> females the midgut infection rates did not fluctuate as strongly. this suggests that hwe responded more sensitively to changes in virus dose present in bloodmeals of different challenge experiments. at  <dig> days pbm the mean infection rate of the carcasses was significantly lower among hwe than among carb/dcr <dig> females. at  <dig> days pbm mean midgut and carcass infection rates no longer differed significantly between both mosquito strains. in carb/dcr <dig> females mean infection rates were decreased by 20% at  <dig> days pbm compared to those at  <dig> days pbm even though in hwe they were increased by ~20% . this is in accordance with the data obtained from the analysis of midgut infection intensity , showing that in the transgenic mosquitoes sinv was diminished in midguts after  <dig> days pbm.

when comparing the mean dissemination rates of sinv-tr339egfp between hwe and carb/dcr <dig>  we only considered mosquitoes having infections in both midgut and carcass at  <dig> or  <dig> days pbm. in both mosquito strains, virus dissemination rates followed a pattern similar to the midgut infection rates at  <dig> days pbm . differences were not statistically significant between carb/dcr <dig> and hwe mosquitoes even though dissemination rates were about twice as high in carb/dcr <dig> females  at  <dig> days pbm. the lack of statistical significance could be due to the smaller sample sizes available for this experiment. however, our data suggest that dissemination rates for sinv-tr339egfp are dependent on the virus dose ingested by the mosquito.

survival rates of carb/dcr <dig> females after infection with sinv-tr339egfp
we evaluated the effect of midgut-specific impairment of the rnai pathway on the longevity of mosquitoes once they were infected with sinv-tr339egfp. so far our data have shown that at  <dig> days pbm the rnai pathway-impaired mosquitoes contained higher doses of the virus than the hwe control. we monitored the survival rate of mosquitoes for four weeks after bloodfeeding. bloodfeeding appeared to have a beneficial effect for both carb/dcr <dig> and hwe females since 50% of the insects were still alive at day  <dig> pbm whereas of the sugarfed control only 20% were alive at the same time point . when both mosquito strains were infected with sinv-tr339egfp , their longevity was not affected in comparison to non-infected, bloodfed mosquitoes. the survival curves looked similar for carb/dcr <dig> and hwe females, indicating that sinv infection did not cause an obvious fitness cost in the rnai-impaired mosquitoes.

discussion
this study demonstrates for the first time a transgenic approach to impair the endogenous rnai pathway in midgut tissue of ae. aegypti. following the principle of activating the rnai pathway in specific tissues during digestion of a bloodmeal  <cit> , we generated mosquitoes expressing an aa-dcr <dig> targeting ir rna in the midgut to trigger the rnai pathway against itself. thus, we developed a novel tool to study arbovirus-mosquito interactions at the molecular level. with current genetic tools it is not possible to generate a stable gene-knockout mutant of ae. aegypti via homologous recombination . in addition, although intrathoracic injection of dsrna has been shown to be sufficient to manipulate the rnai pathway in mosquitoes  <cit>  the strategy presented here bears several advantages. 1) injuries caused by intrathoracic injection of dsrnas are eliminated, preventing non-specific triggering of other immune pathways and/or reduced longevity of the insect. 2) off-target effects caused by high doses of injected dsrnas dispersed throughout the mosquito body are avoided. 3) precise temporal and spatial gene targeting is ensured.

aa-dcr <dig> acts at the beginning of the initiation phase of the sirnai pathway by cleaving long dsrna molecules into ~ <dig> bp duplexes. with the support of aa-r2d <dig> these sirna duplexes are inserted into the risc complex  <cit> . when silencing aa-dcr <dig> using an ir rna with sequence homology, we expected aa-dcr <dig> mrna levels in the cell to diminish over time, which would result in depletion of dicer <dig> protein. eventually, there would be insufficient dicer <dig> enzyme available to maintain the rnai pathway in a functional state. based on the pattern of aecpa promoter-based expression, impairing of the rnai pathway was supposed to last for only  <dig> h during digestion of the bloodmeal in the midgut. before the onset of aa-dcr <dig> mrna silencing in midgut cells of carb/dcr <dig> females, most likely there were sufficient quantities of dicer <dig> protein synthesized, which could turn the rnai mechanism against itself. possibly during the entire  <dig> h period of rnai silencing certain quantities of functional dicer <dig> prevailed in the midgut cells so that the pathway was compromised in its efficiency and capacity but never completely shut off. similar lack of complete inhibition of rnai was observed before when transiently silencing dcr <dig> in drosophila s <dig> cells  <cit> . this could explain the pattern of the aa-dcr <dig> mrna expression profiles in carb/dcr <dig> females, where the efficiency of aa-dcr <dig> mrna silencing fluctuated over time but its expression was never eliminated. moreover, infection with sinv resulted in increased aa-dcr <dig> mrna accumulation in carb/dcr <dig> females, showing that the midgut epithelial cells were still able to mobilize additional dicer <dig> protein, even though the pathway was impaired in the midgut tissue. increase in aa-dcr <dig> mrna accumulation confirms earlier findings that the tr <dig> strain of sinv triggers the rnai pathway in ae. aegypti  <cit> . however, no mechanism for aa-dcr <dig> induction has been described so far. we have no clear explanation as to why at  <dig> days pbm aa-dcr <dig> mrna levels were increased in both hwe and carb/dcr <dig> females. we observed that levels of transgenic aa-dcr <dig> silencing varied considerably between the different transgenic mosquito lines that were initially tested. this could be caused by corresponding variations in aa-dcr <dig> ir rna expression levels. based on previous observations with transgenic mosquitoes expressing a marker gene in midgut tissue , the te integration site in the genome of the mosquito can strongly affect gene-of-interest expression levels.

even though maximal silencing of aa-dcr <dig> in midguts of sinv-tr339egfp infected carb/dcr <dig> females appeared to be no more than ~50%, it had profound effects on intensity of infection, midgut infection and dissemination rates of the virus at  <dig> days pbm. average virus titers in midguts increased from  <dig> pfu/ml in hwe to  <dig>  pfu/ml in carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes. accordingly, midgut infection rates increased from 33%  to 69%  and virus dissemination rates from 30%  to 60% . these data suggest that the rnai pathway in the mosquito midgut tightly controls sinv infection by modulating its replication. thus, mib and meb for sinv-tr339egfp in ae. aegypti were virus dose-dependent and in this way affected by the rnai pathway. whereas a virus dose-dependent meb has been reported for the tr <dig> strain of sinv, no mib has been observed for this virus  <cit> . despite the fact that the authors used another mosquito strain in their studies, they also used a non-egfp expressing virus and higher virus concentrations in their bloodmeals, ranging from 108- <dig> pfu/ml. in our study the virus concentrations in bloodmeals ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml. in the presence of a functional rnai mechanism as in hwe mosquitoes, the lower virus concentration in the bloodmeal was probably approaching the threshold for midgut infection. in the rnai pathway impaired carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes however, this virus concentration was sufficient to cause productive midgut infections.

between  <dig> and  <dig> days pbm a strong reduction of virus infection intensity was observed in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes, causing a decrease in average sinv titers from  <dig>  to  <dig> pfu/ml. such strong reduction of virus infection intensity was not observed in the rnai pathway competent hwe control. after  <dig> days pbm the rnai pathway in carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes was no longer compromised as it was during virus acquisition. it appears that the rnai mechanism, when functional, down-regulated the unusually high sinv concentration in midguts of the transgenic mosquitoes to levels similar to those of the hwe control. this strongly suggests that the task of the rnai pathway in the mosquito midgut is to keep arbovirus replication at a level that can be tolerated by the mosquito. modulation of arbovirus infections in mosquitoes has been reported for several virus-vector combinations and research of the last few years eventually confirmed that the rnai pathway of the mosquito is a major driving force behind this modulation  <cit> . nevertheless, recent studies indicate that other innate immune pathways, such as jak-stat and/or toll also contribute to the modulation of arbovirus infections in insects  <cit> .

since a proposed role for the rnai pathway in mosquitoes is to protect the insect from pathogenic effects of replicating arboviruses  <cit> , we investigated whether sinv-tr339egfp causes such effects in hwe or carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes. our survival curve data indicate that the initial increase in virus titer in carb/dcr <dig> females did not cause obvious pathogenic effects. it needs to be pointed out that after  <dig> days pbm the rnai pathway was no longer impaired in midguts of carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes and the intensity of infection was strongly modulated. thus, the rnai pathway activation in the transgenic mosquito line could have been similar to that in the control for the latter  <dig> days of the survival study. our observations confirm those by campbell and co-workers  <cit>  that transient silencing of the rnai pathway in ae. aegypti did not affect longevity of the mosquitoes for seven days after infection with sinv. however, several authors have described pathological effects caused by alphaviruses in mosquito midguts and salivary glands, claiming that these effects could be virus dose-dependent  <cit> . moreover, systemic expression of a potent rnai pathway suppressor via a recombinant sinv severely reduced the survival rate of mosquitoes  <cit> . thus, it might be necessary to knockout the rnai pathway in the insect to reveal long-term effects of a compromised, antiviral immune pathway on mosquito fitness.

CONCLUSIONS
we generated transgenic mosquitoes that have an impaired rnai pathway in the midgut following ingestion of a bloodmeal. these mosquitoes, carb/dcr <dig>  represent a novel tool to study arbovirus-mosquito interactions at the molecular level. temporal impairment of the rnai pathway in the midgut epithelium of carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes significantly increased the infection intensity of sinv-tr339egfp, thereby allowing the virus to overcome mib and meb. thus, both barriers, which are affected by the endogenous rnai mechanism, appear to be virus dose-dependent phenomena for this sinv strain in ae. aegypti. furthermore, the infection pattern of sinv in carb/dcr <dig> females suggests that the rnai pathway is modulating virus replication in the midgut to prevent the virus from reaching harmful concentrations in the insect. as a consequence, longevity of sinv-tr339egfp infected mosquitoes was similar to that of non-infected ones. overall, our data confirm that the mosquito midgut is the central organ that determines vector competence for arboviruses.

future directions
using carb/dcr <dig> mosquitoes, we plan to evaluate effects of rnai pathway impairment in the midgut on infection patterns of dengue and chikungunya viruses, which are naturally transmitted by this mosquito species.
