BACKGROUND
in gene expression profiling pooling is a method to reduce hybridization costs and compensate for insufficient amounts of mrna. in the subsequent statistical analyses of gene expression data, where a log-transformation during preprocessing is standard, it is important to consider how the expectation and variance of the gene expression of pools relate to individual samples. the impact of pooling on the identification of differential gene expression has been studied in kendziorski et al.  <cit> , separately for different pool sizes. it has been shown that biological averaging occurs for most of the transcripts and differential expression inferences are comparable for individuals and pools. in zhang et al.  <cit>  approximations for the expectation and variance of pooled samples were derived. furthermore, it was shown that biases as well as heteroscedasticity are introduced by variable pool sizes. experiments with unequal pool sizes therefore were recommended to be avoided. as demonstrated in rudolf et al.  <cit> , however, a wide class of experiments, in which pool size can be handled as a nuisance effect and is cross-classified with treatment, allows for tests of unbiased contrasts. in the case of a balanced cross-classification the pool size effect must not explicitly appear in the model at all, though hypotheses on treatments remain unbiased, as shown in rudolf et al.  <cit> . in any case variable pool sizes have an effect on the covariance of observations. this can be taken into account by considering how many individuals are allocated to each pool and by introducing a random effect for blending along with a corresponding variance component. the latter can be interpreted as a second kind of technical variability induced by inaccuracies in blending slightly unequally-sized aliquots of mrna from several individuals into common pools. though this subject has been treated theoretically as described, investigation into the practical importance of this second kind of technical variability is lacking.

consequently a study was performed, in which gene expression data from experiments with four different species were analyzed to investigate the relevance of the aforementioned new kind of technical error in terms of size and significance of the corresponding variance component. furthermore, we investigated potential consequences on the number of transcripts identified as differentially expressed between different treatments when analyses neglect this kind of error.

methods
this section offers a short recap of the underlying statistical models. the four experimental data sets are then introduced. in all of them - whether from single- or two-color arrays - there are more observations than pools , which allows for the estimation of all desired variance components. data simulations are also described and have been included as a useful aid for the interpretation of the experimental data results. finally, the statistical methods applied for parameter estimation and statistical testing are described.


random effects in gene expression experiments with variable pool sizes
when aliquots of mrna from different individuals are blended into common pools, the inaccuracies of this procedure may induce a special kind of technical error. respective random effects, together with a corresponding variance component, were proposed  <cit>  as a means of modeling the variability of pooled observations in gene expression experiments with variable pool sizes . thus, for background-corrected and normalized log-intensities y  of a certain transcript, the model in matrix notation is: 
  y=xβ+z1u1+z2u2+e, 

where x and z are the design matrices of the fixed ⊤) and random  effects. the distribution of uj is assumed to be uj∼n,j= <dig>  with covariance matrices gjσj <dig>  and the residuals are e∼n. random effects of single individuals are assumed to be independently identically distributed with a biological variance σ <dig>  while observations from a number of γi pooled individuals have a biological variance σ12γi. the vector u <dig> may comprise biological effects of single individuals as well as average biological effects of groups of individuals constituting common pools, according to the experimental design.

the random effect of blending  only applies to observations from pools and not to observations from single individuals. therefore, u <dig> consists of one effect per mixture, which had been prepared in the lab. the associated variance component is σ <dig>  so, the variance of the observations becomes: 
  v=z1g1z1⊤σ12+z2g2z2⊤σ22+inσe <dig>  

the model of this variance structure is based on the closed form approximation of the variance of pools on the scale of log-intensities, proposed in  <cit>  
  vi≈eσb2−11γi+eσb2−1σz2γi−1γi <dig>  

where σz <dig> is the pooling technical variance and σb <dig> is the biological variance of individuals. the substitutions σ12:=eσb2− <dig> and σ22:=σz <dig> led to our assumed variance structure .

in the following, the relevance of accounting for the blending error variance component σ <dig> is investigated in four experimental data sets by comparing the described full model  described above with a reduced one  that lacks this particular variance component. the methodology was checked by a simulation beforehand.

experimental data
mouse data
mouse data consisted of observations from  <dig> one-color microarrays. rna for this experiment was extracted from the ovaries of  <dig> female mice,  <dig> of which came from a long-term selection line with an extraordinary litter size. all others came from a control line. pooled samples were built by blending rna from five mice per sample. each mouse was only represented in a single pool. for the sake of technical replication, all  <dig> pooled samples were measured twice by preparing two microarrays per sample. additionally, animals from two pools per line  were measured individually. these individual measurements were not included in the previously published analysis of this data  <cit> , where more details of the experiment can be found.

twenty-eight  different biological effects were defined per transcript. the dimensions of the design matrix z1m are therefore  <dig> ×  <dig>  in detail, random biological effects were assigned to all individually measured mice  and corresponding entries in z1m equal  <dig>  the biological effects of the same ten individuals  were assigned to the observations from the first and second pooled samples in each line . in this case, non-zero entries in z1m are 1/ <dig>  however, pooled samples numbered three to six within each line each had a biological effect of their own, modeling the average effect of the five respective members of each pool. note that for the pools three to six the corresponding non-zero entries in z1m are  <dig>  the 28× <dig> covariance matrix g1m scales the random biological effects and has non-zero entries only on the diagonal, each of them equals the inverse pool size 1/γi. the  <dig> observations from the first line are represented in the upper part of the design matrix z1m: 
 z1m= <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> . <dig> .200000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000100000000000000⋮⋮⋮⋮. 

the technical variability due to blending individual samples only comes into play when observing pooled samples, not for measurements of individuals. since blending was done only once per pool, there are  <dig> different effects due to imperfect blending. therefore, the 44× <dig> design matrix z2m  contains zero rows for observations from single animals. the corresponding 12× <dig> covariance matrix g2m is diagonal with entries γ−1γ2= <dig>  according to eq. .

this study did not involve in vivo experiments. animals were housed according to the german law for animal protection  and in compliance with the european legislation on the care and use of animals.

rat data
this data set was analyzed by kendziorki et al.  <cit>  and contains one-color array data. rats of the treatment group were treated with retinoic acid. for the details of data generation and preprocessing, please see the original paper  <cit> . rats from the groups a  and b  were measured individually and in pools of various sizes. each of the twelve rats from both groups was used four times, for an individual measurement and in pools of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for the sample composition we again defined the random effects from the smallest disjunct elements. therefore, with the help of the matrices g1r and z1r, convex linear combinations were built from the  <dig> individuals. here, g1r is the  <dig> ×  <dig> unity matrix and z1r contains a row for each measurement with entries according to reciprocal pool sizes. per group, there are  <dig> measurements partitioned into  <dig> individual samples,  <dig> pools of  <dig>   <dig> pools of  <dig>  and one of  <dig>  plus  <dig> technical replications. thus, the dimensions of the matrix z1r are 56× <dig>  detailed in the additional file  <dig>  in each group, there were  <dig> pools, and the diagonal matrix g2r has the dimensions 22× <dig> with entries  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> .... the matrix z2r was constructed analogously to z1r.

honey bee data
this data set stems from a honeybee project dealing with differences in the pathogen resistance of so-called hygienic and non-hygienic worker bees as far as they are reflected in gene expression differences. bees designated as ’hygienic’ were observed to open brood cells and assisting the removal of diseased brood. the bees’ activities were recorded on a varroa-parasitized section of a brood comb. pooling was applied in a preliminary experiment with a limited number of bees and microarrays. for seven hygienic bees and seven control bees, mrna was extracted from nerve tissues of the mushroom body , antennal lobe  and antennae . the number of individuals blended into a pool was either two or four. out of the  <dig> bees, six different sample compositions were built and analyzed for all three tissues with two-color arrays . a few individual hybridizations were not carried out due to an insufficient amount of amplified rna . for the normalized two-color microarray data we used a model for differences m of log-intensities from the red  and green  channel 
  m=μ+Δ+b12+b23+z1u1+z2u2+e. fig.  <dig> design of the honey bee experiment. scheme for the design of the two-color microarray experiment with honey bees. the numbered arrows  represent two-color arrays, the arrowheads  indicate cy <dig>  dye. light  boxes symbolize rna from hygienic  bees. pool size  and mixture  are shown in each box. tissues are abbreviated as mb , al , and ant . boxes in the same column share the same biological effect, indicated as pool compositions  <dig> to 6



here m is the vector of log-ratios  for one transcript with dimension n, equal to the number of arrays. the design matrix x for the fixed effects links observations to the overall mean μ , the differences Δ between the behaviors  and two differences between tissues . the latter effect has been included since data from all tissues were jointly analyzed due to the limited number of arrays. the random effect u <dig> for each sample composition has a variance structure determined by g1h and z1h. the variance structure of the second random effect u <dig> for the blending of individuals is generated by g2h and z2h. both design matrices for the random effects differ, however, from experiments with one-color arrays: each row of z <dig> and z <dig> contains two non-zero elements  in order to model the differences between effects with entries of  <dig> for the red and − <dig> for the green channel. the residual errors e∼n are again assumed to be stochastically independent and include the technical errors created through the hybridization, imaging, and scanning of each array.

human data
the human data was taken from the gc <dig>  project. for the project data, please see maertzdorf et al.  <cit>  and jacobsen et al.  <cit> . one focus of this project was to identify immune system differences between people who were exposed to tuberculosis but never became sick and those who developed severe symptoms. therefore, as a part of this larger study the three classes tst+, tst− and tb were compared, where tst stands for the tuberculosis skin test  and tb for acute tuberculosis. overall, the data set consists of samples from  <dig> humans in  <dig> pools of three and in ten single samples, which were labeled on  <dig> two-color arrays. in the sample composition, one also sees correlations between pools in three cases, where individuals were used more than once, i.e. in different pools . for each observation we modeled fixed effects for the mean  and treatment  as well as random effects of sample composition and imperfect blending. because there were two samples on each array, the design matrix z1g for the composition of the samples had two entries per row, as presented in the additional files  <dig>  each pool was built only once, so g2g is a diagonal matrix with dimensions 16× <dig> and entries  <dig>  the random effects of imperfect blending were assigned to measurements via z2g, with two non-zero entries per measurement.

this study was approved by ethical committees in both stellenbosch  and berlin  and written informed consent has been obtained from all study participants .

simulated data
the relationship between the variance of a random effect of a pool and deviations from the homogene aliquots of individuals in a pool sample, given in eq. , is based on a theoretically derived approximation  <cit> . furthermore, true proportions of aliquots are not available. therefore, the equality of the estimated variance component σ <dig> and the product of variances σz <dig> was checked by fitting the model to simulated data, in order to assay the estimations when the true state of nature is known.

by setting x∼n the vector of individual gene expressions of the individuals of a pool and w the vector of weights , we calculated a value for true gene expression on the log-scale as 
  logw⊤×expx. 

the technical errors, distributed as n, were then added. note that, due to , each observation is composed by the fixed effects xβ=μg, the distortion due to biological variation u1=x¯−μg and the difference generated by imperfect blending u2=log−logexpx¯, plus the log-bias logexpx¯−x¯. for the simulation of weights the dirichlet distribution with parameters ai=1σz2−1γ, i= <dig> …,γ was used. then, a0=∑i=1γai=γai, and the expectation of each weight is aia0=1γ. therefore, the variance of the weights - theoretically aia <dig> - is γ−1γ3σz <dig>  using the approximation γ−1γ3σz2≈σw <dig> for the variance of weights w from  <cit> , the dirichlet parameters ai can be chosen in order to obtain weights with a given variance σw <dig> 

various proportions of transcripts  were simulated as affected by imperfect blending. in order to investigate the distribution of the rlrt-statistic under the null hypothesis , the pooling technical variance σz <dig> was set to zero for all transcripts. then, one third of the transcripts were simulated with imperfect blending, as well as data where all transcripts contained these effects.

as a test case, further simulations were tailored for a comparison of models with regard to the power to detect differential expression in the presence of imperfect pooling at all loci. variances were set to σt2= <dig> , σb2= <dig>  and σz2= <dig>  according to the estimations from the mouse data. this was simulated with  <dig> repetitions. an experiment consisting of  <dig> individuals from two equally-sized treatment groups was simulated, in a  <dig> one-color microarray setting. the observations generated were both from single individuals  and pools of size five . the individual values used in the first two pools of each line were also used as single individuals. for the full details of the design, please see the description of the mouse data set above, which has an identical structure. for each of the  <dig> transcripts, a mean expression level was randomly chosen from a uniform distribution over the interval  <cit> . a subgroup of  <dig> transcripts was randomly chosen to be differentially expressed between both treatment groups. for each of these, a mean treatment effect was sampled from a uniform distribution over the interval  with a random sign ∈{− <dig> }. false positive and negative test results were then evaluated using the mean number of transcripts, averaged over all  <dig> repetitions.

statistical analyses
three variance components were considered: first, biological variance ; second, blending error variance ; and third, residual variance . similar models that lack the second variance component have been used previously . transcripts were excluded from analyses if the log-expressions of both groups were smaller than eight , which is frequently considered to be a threshold for meaningful gene expression. this resulted in  <dig> observations for the mouse data,  <dig> for rats,  <dig>  for bees and  <dig>  for the human data set. an em-reml algorithm was used to estimate the variance components. then the mixed model equations 
 x⊤xx⊤z1x⊤z2z1⊤xz1⊤z1+g1−1λ1z1⊤z2z2⊤xz2⊤z1z2⊤z2+g2−1λ2β^u^1u^2=x⊤yz1⊤yz22⊤y,  where λ1=σe2σ <dig> and λ2=σe2σ <dig>  were solved for the estimates of the fixed and random effects and the reml-log-likelihood was calculated.

for each transcript, a residual likelihood ratio test  was used to test the null hypothesis h0:σ22= <dig>  thereby assuming a half-half mixture of a χ12-distribution and a point mass at zero . according to this assumed distribution of the test statistic, the distribution of p-values from all transcripts in one experiment under the null hypothesis deviates from the uniform distribution . the proportion of transcripts with a relevant blending error variance was estimated as π^1=1−π^ <dig>  therein, the estimated proportion of true null hypotheses  was estimated as described in dabney and storey  <cit> . the proportion π^ <dig> was then compared with the proportion of transcripts simulated without blending errors. after correcting all p-values according to a false discovery rate  of  <dig> %, the transcripts with a significant rlrt were determined. beyond that, we evaluated the proportions of the estimated variance component σ <dig> in relation to the total variance.

the practical relevance of the variance component for imperfect blending of samples was further investigated by comparing the number of transcripts identified as differentially expressed in different treatment levels by means of the full model  and the null model  y=xβ+z1u1+e without a random effect of imperfect blending. degrees of freedom for the applied f-tests of fixed effects in mixed models were adjusted according to kenward and roger  <cit> . in order to account for multiple testing, an fdr of  <dig> % was applied to the p-values of the latter f-tests.

for the mouse data set, the normalization was done with the gcrma method  <cit> . loess- and quantile normalization  <cit>  was used for the two-color array data. the rat data set was downloaded as normalized.

the open-source statistical programming package r  <cit>  was used to implement an em-reml algorithm for the estimation of all three variance components. the formulas for the expectation and maximization steps can be obtained from e.g. mrode and thompson  <cit> . convergence of the em algorithm was assumed when the condition 
  bn−1−bn⊤bn−1−bnbn⊤bn<ε, 

was fulfilled  <cit> , where ε=10− <dig> and bn=σ12^σ22^σe2^⊤ is the vector of estimates of the variance components in the n-th iteration. false discovery rates were computed with the help of the r-package qvalue  <cit> . in the case of p-values from rlrt test statistics, the ’bootstrap’ option was used to estimate π <dig>  as suggested by storey  <cit> .

RESULTS
simulated data sets
first, the results of the rlrt for the blending error variance component are shown for the case of the validity of the null hypothesis . here, a uniform distribution of p-values can be observed on the interval [ <dig> .5) as expected . the distributions of log-estimates of σ <dig>  show an increasing proportion of large values, in full accordance with the increase in the simulated proportions of transcripts with a relevant blending error variance . the corresponding p-values  fairly mirror the same trend. the estimates for π^ <dig> approximated the simulated proportions of affected transcripts well. however, when it came to the identification of individual transcripts, their number clearly lagged behind the proportions present in the data. corresponding results are shown in table  <dig>

differences in both models’ abilities to find differential expression in the simulated data sets were also observed . the null model yielded an average of  <dig> expressed transcripts declared as differentially expressed, compared to  <dig> from the full model. the average shared number is  <dig>  but the  <dig> simulated as differentially expressed in a total of  <dig> transcripts was clearly outbid by both models. figure  <dig> shows the average numbers of four sets of transcripts and their intersections: the set of transcripts with a simulated differential expression, one set of transcripts identified as differentially expressed for each of both models, and the set of transcripts, which were identified as connected with an attributable  blending error variance. upon counting the numbers in the intersection regions which corresponded to true discoveries, a similarly high power for both models was observed. only  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the transcripts simulated as differentially expressed have not been found. but, adding the numbers which correspond to false discoveries yielded a value of /6000= <dig>  for m <dig> and /6000= <dig>  for m <dig>  this is clearly larger than  <dig> %, the chosen level of permitted false discoveries. the number of transcripts incorrectly labelled as differentially expressed in the group of transcripts with a significant blending error variance was inflated by a factor of about three for m <dig>  in comparison with m <dig> .

furthermore, in a series of simulations, the pooling technical variance σz <dig> was varied within the range of   shows nearly perfect consistency. the exception is some upward bias for very small simulated values, which can be attributed to the well-known properties of the reml-method  <cit> .

therefore, it can be concluded at the very least that tests for differential expression with the m <dig> model tend to be too optimistic, depending on the given experimental conditions. to summarize, should the model contain the additional random effect of imperfect blending, the statistical analysis yields results which agree very well with the simulated characteristics.

experimental data
histograms of log-transformed estimations of the variance components due to imperfect blending are shown in fig.  <dig>  estimates range from nearly zero  to less than one hundred . a clear bimodal distribution can be observed in all cases, where the left part of each distribution  represents very small values close to zero while the other part represents more substantial values. in the mouse and the bee data, the proportion of transcripts with substantially large values clearly exceeds the proportion of small values. for the human data, the proportion of small estimates also prevails somewhat, while a balance between minor and substantial values can be observed for the rat data. this is also reflected in the average  of all three variance components obtained with the reduced  and the full  models, as shown in table  <dig>  in light of the averages, the inclusion of a blending error variance had the consequence of a more or less reduced residual variance, most pronounced in the mouse and honey bee data. in the human data, the average residual variance remained almost constant, yet the average biological variance decreased - a phenomenon not observed in the other data sets. distributions of the size of σ <dig> relative to the total variance of a standard observation - with respective pool sizes of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for mouse, rat, bee and human data are given in fig.  <dig> . all distributions exhibit a clear spike near zero, followed by estimates that nearly exceed the full range of variance ratios. the rat data are an exception; hardly any values larger than  <dig>  were observed.

these impressions are mirrored by the distributions of p-values from rlrt-tests for the hypothesis of a non-existing  blending error variance . the number of individual transcripts, which could be associated with a non-zero blending error variance at a false discovery rate of  <dig> %, varied strongly between data sets. there were  <dig> of such transcripts in the mouse data and  <dig> in the honey bee data, while only six were identified in the rat data and none at all in the human data . these high numbers are consistent with considerable estimates for the fraction  of non-zero variances in mouse  and honey bee  data . note that the respective estimated proportions were π^1= <dig>  and π^1= <dig>  in the rat and human data , also indicating the existence of non-zero blending error variances in these two data sets, though almost no particular non-zero variance could have successfully been identified at the chosen false discovery rate of  <dig> %.

counts of differentially expressed transcripts detected with both models are shown in table  <dig>  about half of all transcripts analyzed were declared differentially expressed in the mouse data. about five hundred were exclusively detected with one of both models:  <dig> with the null model and  <dig> with the full model. the list of the top  <dig> transcripts - ranked by their p-values - showed a large dissimilarity as indicated by a value of  <dig>  for kendall’s correlation test. in the rat data,  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts were jointly identified by both models, while  <dig> were solely found with the help of m <dig> and  <dig> with m <dig>  no numbers appear in table  <dig> for the honeybee data, as no differentially expressed transcripts were found. finally, there were  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts from the null model in the human data, from which only  <dig> were ’confirmed’ by the full model.

CONCLUSIONS
in light of the large numbers of blending error variances diagnosed as greater than zero in the mouse and honey bee data, the practical relevance of this second kind of technical error has been clearly demonstrated. in both other data sets, estimates of π^ <dig>  the proportion of positive blending error variances, may be taken as an indicator of their existence, though hardly any particular values could be identified, presumably due to a lack of power. as demonstrated mainly by simulation, there are also consequences for the detection of differentially expressed transcripts, in which the nominal fdr-level was shown to be too optimistic when the blending error variance was not taken into account. therefore, we strongly recommend the application of adequate models  including random blending effects and their variances when observations from pools of different sizes are to be jointly analysed.
