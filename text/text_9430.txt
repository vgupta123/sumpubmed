BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  are professional antigen-presenting cells  that play key roles in the regulation of immune responses to a variety of antigens and immune sentinels as initiators of t cell responses against microbial pathogens  <cit> . in addition, during inflammation or infection, dcs are mobilized in and out of the peripheral tissues. activated dcs are targeted to secondary lymphoid organs and toward t cell activation by antigen presentation  <cit> . dcs can capture degraded bacteria or protein of bacteria and present their antigens on major histocompatibility complex  class molecules to t cells  <cit> . as a result, an adaptive immune response that specifically targets bacteria-derived antigens is initiated. maturing dcs then migrate to the lymphoid organs, where they activate naïve t cells by stimulating antigenic peptide-presenting mhc type i and ii receptors and their co-stimulatory molecules  <cit> . therefore, dcs provide a link between innate and adaptive immune responses.

salmonella species cause typhoid fever and gastroenteritis in humans and pose a global threat to human health  <cit> . salmonella also infect broad array of animals, resulting in diseases ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening systemic infections  <cit> . a recent report has shown that salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is a bacterial pathogen capable of interfering with dc functions, and causes a typhoid-like disease in mice  <cit> . it has also been reported that the effect of selectively reduced intracellular proliferation of s. enteria serovar typhimurium within apcs limits both antigen presentation and development of a rapid cd <dig> t cell response  <cit> . outer membrane protein  from s. enteria serovar typhimurium was shown to contribute to confers protection against typhod.

however, it is still not known if hosts mount protective immune responses against s. enterica serovar typhimurium, thus understanding how the immune system responds to these bacteria is essential for the development of an effective s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine.

in this study, we determined the effects of a non-cytotoxic concentration of purified outer membrane protein a from s. enterica serovar typhimurium  on the maturation and function of dcs. our findings suggest, for the first time, that exposure to ompa-sal induces phenotypic and functional maturation of dcs. interestingly, exposure to ompa-sal induced the activation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk via tlr <dig>  the findings presented herein suggest that ompa-sal induces activation of dcs and initiates an adaptive immune response by polarizing t-cell development to a th <dig> response, information which will prove crucial in the development of a s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine.

RESULTS
ompa-sal induces dc maturation
we purified ompa-sal from e. coli and assessed its cytotoxicity on dcs because the purified ompa-sal was derived from s. enterica serovar typhimurim. dcs were treated with various concentrations of ompa-sal for  <dig> h. there were no statistically significant differences in the percentages of dead cells in dc cultures exposed to as much as  <dig> ng/ml of ompa-sal, the concentration at which cell death was detected by annexin v/pi staining . this indicated that our recombinant ompa-sal was not cytotoxic to dcs and did not contain amounts of endotoxin that would interfere with our studies using concentrations <  <dig> ng/ml. to determine the effects of ompa-sal on the maturation of sentinel dcs into effector dcs, bm-derived dcs were cultured with gm-csf and il- <dig> for  <dig> days under standard conditions, followed by  <dig> day in the presence of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ng/ml of ompa-sal. lps was used as a positive control. the resulting populations of dcs were analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of co-stimulatory molecules involved in t cell activation. ompa-sal-treated dcs had increased expression of dc maturation co-stimulatory markers . interestingly, the expression of cd <dig> and mhc class ii by ompa-sal-treated dcs was higher than lps-treated dcs. these results indicated that ompa-sal induces dc maturation in a dose-dependent manner.

ompa-sal reduces the endocytic activity of dcs
immature dcs are efficient in the capture and endocytosis of antigens. these cells can internalize large amounts of antigen through each fluid-phase uptake via macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated uptake. however, in the case of mature dcs, the capacity to capture antigen and confer potent co-stimulatory activity for t cells is decreased  <cit> . we investigated whether ompa-sal-treated dcs had reduced endocytic activity characteristic of functionally mature dcs. as shown in fig. 2a, the percentage of double-positive cells was lower in the lps-treated dcs than in the untreated dcs. similarly, the percentage of double-positive cells was lower in the ompa-sal-treated dcs compared with untreated dcs. these data show that the ompa-sal-treated dcs had reduced endocytic activity, which indicates functional maturity.

ompa-sal increases the number of il-12-producing dcs, but not il-10
apc, such as dcs, have been shown to direct th <dig> development by production of il- <dig>  <cit> . the effector factors that drive the development of th1- and th2-type t cells are il- <dig> from dcs and ifn-γ or il- <dig> from t cells. we determined whether ompa-sal induced differentiation of th <dig> subsets, and il-12-producing dcs were analyzed by flow cytometry and elisa. we also investigated the production of both intracellular il-12p40p <dig> and bioactive il-12p <dig> in ompa-sal-treated dcs. as shown in fig. 2b, ompa-sal treatment of dcs increased the percentage of il-12-producing cells compared with the results obtained for untreated dcs. next, we investigated the production of il- <dig>  a pleoiotropic cytokine known to have inhibitory effects on the accessory functions of dcs, which appears to play a role in th <dig> immune responses. the production of il- <dig> was detectable similar to that of negative controls .

ompa-sal-treated dcs enhances th <dig> polarization and ifn-γ production
to determine whether or not ompa-sal-treated dcs stimulate cd4+ t cell activation, we stimulated dcs with  <dig> ng/ml of ompa-sal for 24h and performed an allogeneic mixed-lymphocyte reaction. cd4+ splenic t cells from balb/c mice were co-cultured with ompa-sal-treated dcs derived from c57bl/ <dig> mice. the ompa-sal-treated dcs induced an advanced rate of t-cell proliferation compared to the untreated control dcs . in addition, we determined the cytokine production of cd4+ t cells stimulated by ompa-sal-treated dcs. as shown in fig. 3b, allogeneic t cells primed with ompa-sal-treated dcs produced a th <dig> cytokine profile that included large amounts of ifn-γ and low amounts of il- <dig>  these data suggest that ompa-sal enhances the immunostimulatory capacity of dcs to stimulated t cells. moreover, we investigated whether cosignaling via cd <dig> and/or cd <dig> enhances th <dig> response, we found that blockage of cd <dig> and cd <dig> decreased ifn-γ production. these data suggested that both cd <dig> and cd <dig> are essential for the th <dig> response of ompa-sal treated dcs.

ompa-sal induces dc maturation by tlr <dig> signaling
toll-like receptors  link innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . the dc response to tlr ligands depends on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases , including erk1/ <dig>  jnk1/ <dig>  and p <dig> mapk  <cit> . we determined the effects of ompa-sal on tlrs and the mapk signaling pathway. dcs were treated with  <dig> ng/ml of ompa-sal and tlr activation was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr and phophorylation-specific western blotting. the level of tlr <dig> mrna was significantly higher in ompa-sal-treated dcs than in untreated control dcs, but there was no change in tlr <dig> mrna . moreover, ompa-sal enhanced the phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk in dcs, but not jnk1/ <dig> . to confirm whether or not the maturation of dcs by ompa-sal was mediated by a tlr4-related signaling pathway, we isolated dcs from tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> knock-out mice, then measured il- <dig> production in dcs by ompa-sal treatment. the inducing effect of ompa-sal on il- <dig> production was completely inhibited by tlr4-/- dcs, but it had no effect on tlr2-/- dcs . moreover, we demonstrated that ompa-sal-treated tlr4-/-dcs had no increased expression of dc maturation co-stimulatory markers . these results indicate that the activation and maturation of dcs by ompa-sal is involved in tlr <dig> signaling.

discussion
we have shown that ompa-sal, a major virulence factor of s. enterica serovar typhimurium, is a highly immunogenic protein that induces th <dig> polarization of t cells by dc maturation. some of the omps from bacteria induce dc maturation and regulate th1/th <dig> immune responses  <cit> . isibasi et al previously investigated the omp of salmonella as potential vaccine candidates, diagnostic antigens, and virulence factors  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms of the involvement of dcs and t cells in the immune responses still unknown. the lack of understanding of protective immunity against s. enterica serovar typhimurium has hindered the development of an efficacious vaccine. in this study, we found that ompa-sal induces activation and maturation of dcs, as demonstrated by the high expression of co-stimulatory and mhc class molecules on cell surfaces and reduced endocytic activity. in addition, ompa-sal-treated dcs induced primary t cell stimulatory activity in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction and elicited th <dig> polarization through high levels of ifn-γ and low levels of il- <dig>  we have also shown in the current study that various concentrations of ompa-sal induce high expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  mhc class i, and mhc class ii in dcs. moreover, ompa-sal-treated dcs produced high levels of il- <dig>  but not il- <dig>  these data suggest that ompa-sal strongly induces activation and maturation of dcs, and as a result dcs transmit ompa-sal to the adaptive immune response. successful induction of an adaptive immune response is characterized based on which antigen is presented, the dose, and the duration of presentation  <cit> . in the case of antigen recognition, an intracellular/extracelluar signaling cascade leads to activation of apcs, which in turn promotes further activation of dcs and activated t cells, and results in proliferation of t cells and their differentiation into effector t cells  <cit> . accordingly, t cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions is important for efficient induction of an adaptive immune response by interaction between dcs and t cells. in the current study, we showed that ompa-sal remarkably stimulates t cell proliferation and ifn-γ production, which is a key cytokine of th <dig> polarization through the increase in il- <dig> production by dcs. these findings indicate that ompa-sal from s. enterica serovar typhimurium can induce the th <dig> immune response by dc maturation and il- <dig> production.

we also provide evidence that ompa-sal activates tlr signaling pathways in dcs. the recognition of antigen by tlrs leads to activation of mapk pathways in dcs  <cit> . therefore, the activation of mapk by ompa-sal is a possible mechanism underlying the increased expression of il- <dig> by dcs. in this study, we found that ompa-sal binds to a tlr <dig> on dcs and activates mapk signaling pathway-mediated il- <dig> production. dc produces il- <dig> and direct activation of cd4-positive t cells to differentiate into th <dig> cells that produce high levels of ifn-γ  <cit> . we confirmed these results using tlr2-/- dcs and tlr4-/- dcs. ompa-sal treated tlr2-/- dcs or tlr4-/- dcs and then analyzed il- <dig> production by elisa. we found that ompa-sal-treated tlr4-/- dcs had no il- <dig> production. these results suggest that ompa-sal induced the maturation and activation of dcs via a tlr4-mediated signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that ompa-sal is a potent antigen and initiates a specific th <dig> immune response in vitro. further understanding of the mechanism by which ompa-sal activates dc maturation and activation may facilitate the development of effective s. enterica serovar typhimurim vaccines and an effective immunotherapeutic adjuvant for other infectious diseases.
