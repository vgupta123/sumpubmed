BACKGROUND
in the postimplantation mammalian embryo, germ cells are the first embryonic lineage to become fate-restricted. this was thought to occur during gastrulation at embryonic day  <dig>   in the mouse, when a population of about  <dig> founder primordial germ cells  present at the base of allantois are detected. these pgcs exhibit expression of several genes including dppa <dig>  and akp <dig>  . this view has recently been challenged by the unexpected observation of a distinct pgc precursor population present in the embryo already at e <dig> –e <dig>   <cit> . the pgc precursors express prdm <dig>  and are present in the proximal-posterior epiblast as a row of cells adjacent to the extraembryonic ectoderm. the population of pgc precursors increases from about  <dig> cells at e <dig>  to about  <dig> cells by the time of specification around e <dig> . the initial  <dig> blimp1-positive cells may be derived from epiblast cells already present in the posterior part of the embryo; the rest probably derives from epiblast cells scattered throughout the proximal epiblast, but moving to the posterior part of the embryo during gastrulation  <cit> .

the visceral endoderm  and the extraembryonic ectoderm  play an important role in the emergence of pgcs. this was demonstrated by the observation that epiblast cells isolated from e <dig>  embryos failed to develop any specified tnap-positive pgcs, unless they were cultured either on feeder sto cells, or in the presence of both ve and exe  <cit> . the discovery of the existence of a population of pgc precursors compelled us to investigate whether the ve and exe were directly involved in the specification of pgcs. for this purpose, we used two recently generated transgenic mouse lines, blimp1:gfp and stella:gfp, which allowed us to distinguish between pgc precursors  and specified pgcs   <cit> . we demonstrate that the proximal ve and exe contribute respectively to the generation of the appropriate number of pgc precursors in their correct location between e <dig> –e <dig> . more importantly, proximal ve and exe were not only necessary for the induction of pgc precursors, but also sufficient to induce pgc fate in distal epiblast cells.

RESULTS
the ve is required for the formation of blimp1-positive pgc precursor cells
to clarify how the ve contributed to the development of pgcs, we assessed their formation in explanted blimp1:gfp e <dig> –e <dig>  embryos, from which the ve  was surgically removed . in this transgenic model, membrane-tagged gfp is driven by the blimp <dig> promoter  <cit> . at e <dig> –e <dig> , blimp1-positive pgc precursor cells have not yet emerged in the proximal epiblast , although blimp <dig> is expressed in the ve . the expression of the transgenic explants was monitored after  <dig> and  <dig> days of culture. in -ve explants, no blimp1-positive cells  were observed after  <dig> day  or  <dig> days of culture . in whole embryo explants, blimp1-positive cells were still observed in the ve after  <dig> day of culture , but after  <dig> days of culture a clear cluster of blimp1-positive pgc precursors was observed at the boundary with the extraembryonic region  and blimp <dig> expression was downregulated in the ve . together, these observations suggested an important role of the ve in the induction of the blimp1-positive pgc precursors. note that the small size of the -ve explants after  <dig> days of culture should not hamper the specification of pgcs .

the exe prevents ectopic induction of blimp1-positive pgc precursors
we also studied whether the exe was involved in formation of pgc precursors or in the subsequent commitment of pgc precursors to pgcs. for this we examined the number of pgc  in e <dig> –e <dig>  blimp1:gfp, stella:gfp and Δpeoct4:gfp explanted embryos cultured in the absence of exe . after  <dig> day of culture, similar to whole blimp1:gfp embryo explants, blimp1-positive cells were observed only in the ve of -exe explants . however, after  <dig> days of culture of -exe explants , blimp <dig> was also downregulated in the ve, but the epiblast-derivative was entirely blimp1-positive . note that the dimensions of the epiblast-derivative in both whole and -exe explants are similar .

when stella:gfp or Δpeoct4:gfp e <dig> –e <dig>  embryos were cultured for  <dig> days, no gfp expression  was observed in whole  and -exe explants , suggesting that specification of pgcs had not yet occurred in vitro. after  <dig> days of culture, the blimp1-positive cluster in the explanted whole embryos gave rise to tnap-positive pgcs , whereas the blimp1-expressing cells in -exe explants remained tnap-negative . this suggested that the blimp1-positive cells that populated the epiblast in the -exe explants are either no genuine pgc precursors, or if they are pgc precursors, they may need additional signals to commit to the pgc lineage. in any case, these experiments demonstrate that the exe is  important for the restriction of blimp <dig> induction in the epiblast by the ve.

ve is necessary for the formation of pgc precursors but not for the subsequent pgc-specification event
the absence of blimp1-positive pgc precursor cells in e <dig> –e <dig>  blimp1:gfp -ve explants could be a secondary effect due to defects in the initiation of morphogenetic movements associated with gastrulation. therefore, we cultured slightly older gastrulating embryos , which have a distinct blimp1-positive cluster of ± <dig> pgc precursors  after having removed the still blimp1-positive ve . after  <dig> days in culture, the number of pgcs  observed in blimp1:gfp e <dig> –e <dig>  -ve explants was reduced compared to explants from whole embryos, but more importantly, the number of blimp1-expressing cells was also correspondingly reduced by half  . note that some of the blimp1-positive cells were small and probably entering apoptosis . these smaller cells failed to upregulate stella, but were positive for tnap  . in agreement, we observed higher levels of apoptosis using the tunel-assay in the -ve explants when compared to whole explants .

notably, the pgc precursors present in the -ve explants undergo specification to pgcs, even though the pgc precursor cluster was rather reduced in size , indicating that the size of the cluster is not important for specification. also unexpected was the fact that some of those pgcs acquired a migratory phenotype and were moving out of the pgc-cluster, similarly to pgcs generated from whole e <dig>  embryo-explants  and therefore do not seem to require signals from the ve to do so.

epiblast cells need to be posterior to become pgcs
the ectopic expression of blimp in the -exe explants derived from e <dig> –e <dig>  blimp1:gfp embryos raised the possibility that the exe may be critical for regionalizing the embryo at e <dig> –e <dig> , so that the blimp1-positive pgc precursors can only emerge posteriorly. to investigate this in more detail, we cut e <dig> –e <dig>  transgenic cerl:gfp embryos  <cit>  longitudinally though the long left-right  axis . cerberus-like  is an anterior visceral endoderm  marker  <cit>  and therefore in cerl:gfp transgenic embryos gfp expression is present exclusively in the anterior region, allowing clear identification of the embryonic axes .

the two embryo-halves, each containing epiblast, ve and exe, were cultured separately for  <dig> days. after culture, both embryo halves were stained for alkaline phosphatase-activity to assess the presence of tnap-positive specified pgcs. notably, the explants-pairs that contained pgcs only exhibited them in one of the explant-halves  invariably the posterior part -negative). only one explant-pair  showed pgcs in both explant-halves . our data indicates that the anterior ve and anterior exe were not able to support the formation of pgcs and may even play an active role in repressing blimp <dig> expression.

proximal ve and exe are sufficient to induce pgc formation de novo in distal epiblast cells at e <dig> 
to directly test whether the ve and exe can continuously recruit pgc precursors from the proximal epiblast cells between e <dig> –e <dig> , we investigated the capacity for the de novo formation of pgcs in e <dig> –e <dig>  stella:gfp embryos from which the original cluster of pgc precursors had been removed. to do this, we either removed the entire ve  and introduced inside a small piece of distal epiblast together with a small piece of exe  , or alternatively we removed the entire region of the embryo containing both the proximal epiblast and surrounding proximal ve, and brought the distal embryonic part in contact with the extraembryonic part  . the reconstituted-embryos were analysed after  <dig> days of culture. in '-cluster -proximal ve' explants, we observed no induction of pgcs , however in '-cluster' explants we were able to generate pgcs  expressing both stella and tnap . together, the data clearly show that the combination of proximal ve and exe is not only necessary, but also sufficient to induce pgcs in distal epiblast cells, which usually do not give rise to pgcs in the embryo.

to exclude the possibility that the induced pgcs resulted from contamination of proximal epiblast cells present in the exe, we made reconstituted-embryos using rosa26:lacz distal epiblast and wild type ve and exe. these reconstituted-embryos showed that the newly induced tnap-positive pgcs are lacz-positive, demonstrating that the pgcs indeed originated from the rosa26:lacz distal epiblast .

pgc precursors still need a specific niche to undergo pgc specification
in has been shown in a previous report that a group of e <dig>  proximal posterior cells transplanted into a distal position in the embryo were unable to specify as pgcs  <cit> . however, the existence of the blimp1-positive cluster of pgc precursors was then unknown. therefore, it is possible that the group of proximal-posterior cells transplanted into the distal part of the embryo did not contain any such blimp1-positive pgc-precursors. to unambiguously investigate whether blimp1-expressing pgc precursors could specify to pgcs when placed in the distal epiblast, we transferred small groups of cells including blimp1-positive cells from blimp1:gfp rosa26:lacz e <dig>  embryos to the distal epiblast of e <dig>  wild type embryos  . these experiments demonstrated that the -positive) cells could no longer give rise to tnap-positive pgcs  after  <dig> days of culture. instead, these cells were incorporated into morphologically more anterior structures faraway from the pgc region in the explant . by contrast, transplantation of groups of cells from a proximal-posterior  location of e <dig>  blimp1:gfp rosa26:lacz embryos into a position close to the location of the pgc-precursor cluster in e <dig>  wild type embryos , resulted in the formation of a lacz-positive cluster in the posterior region of the embryo where a few double lacz-positive and tnap-positive pgcs were observed next to wild type pgcs . these results are in agreement with the previous report from  <cit>  and together demonstrate that blimp1-expressing pgc precursors still require local signals present exclusively in the proximal-posterior part of the embryo before they can undergo specification to pgcs.

discussion
regionalization of the embryo by exe  regulates the formation of pgc precursors posteriorly
at e <dig> , the anterior and posterior exe exhibit already different characteristics important for the correct patterning  of the ave and the subsequent patterning  of the epiblast  <cit> . at e <dig> , the exe may no longer influence the migration of the ave, but it still plays a crucial role in regionalizing the epiblast, allowing gastrulation to take place. indeed, elf <dig> mutants, which contain no exe, showed defects in embryonic patterning and failure to undergo gastrulation, despite the fact that the ave is well specified  <cit> . in agreement, our data also suggests that exe plays a critical role at e <dig> –e <dig>  in regionalizing the epiblast with respect to where the pgc precursors can emerge.

the anterior exe  does not support development of pgcs and may even inhibit the formation of blimp1-positive cells. however, it is well known that cells lying throughout the perimeter of the proximal epiblast at e <dig>  can potentially give rise  <dig> hour later to pgcs in the posterior part of the embryo  <cit> . these proximal cells move to the posterior part of the embryo due to the characteristic morphogenetic movements occurring during gastrulation. this directional movement allows some of these cells either to avoid signals from the anterior part of the embryo or to receive the necessary signals in the posterior part to become pgc progenitors.

induction of pgc precursors  occurs gradually between e <dig> –e <dig> 
the ve at e <dig>  shows asymmetric expression of several secreted factors, including cerl and lefty <dig> in the ave, important for the formation of the anteroposterior axis  <cit> . by contrast, there is little evidence for a direct role of the posterior part of the ve in embryonic patterning.

our data suggests that the proximal-posterior ve plays a role in the generation of the full population of pgc precursors in the posterior part of the embryo. the role of the proximal-posterior ve could be that of promoting proliferation of the initial pool of pgc progenitors and therefore removing the ve would block cell division of the pgc progenitors, resulting in a smaller pgc population. alternatively, as the ve is required for general cell survival in culture, we cannot exclude the possibility that normal numbers of pgc precursors were formed but died and could not be traced. however, we favor the possibility that when the ve is removed no more pgc precursors emerge but the ones allocated are able to undergo specification, although due to limitation of the culture system used some degenerate. therefore, we propose that the proximal-posterior ve  is actively recruiting additional pgc precursors from epiblast cells between e <dig> –e <dig> . this model also explains our observations that an e <dig>  embryo is able to generate a pgc cluster de novo, when its original cluster is removed and that e <dig>  distal epiblast cells when placed proximally  are still able to adopt a pgc fate .

are neighbouring somatic cells providing pgc precursors with the molecular niche needed for specification?
the results presented show that cross talk between the posterior epiblast, the proximal ve and exe is needed for the emergence of blimp1-positive pgc precursors. in addition, we also show that blimp1-positive pgc precursors do not autonomously undergo specification to pgcs. it is likely that extra inductive signals present locally trigger the specification of blimp1-positive pgc precursors. the proposed extra inductive signals most probably originate from the extraembryonic mesoderm  surrounding the pgc progenitor cluster and not the ve and exe. in contrast to our ideas, yoshimizu and colleagues  observed that e <dig>  dissociated epiblast cells could give rise to pgcs  <cit> , however they cultured those epiblast cells in the presence of feeder cells, which could be providing the necessary signals for specification.

one of the candidate secreted molecules exclusively expressed by the exm, and not by pgcs, at e <dig>  is bmp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a necessary event during pgc specification is the downregulation of e-cadherin  <cit> , followed by the acquisition of a motile phenotype. both fgf and wnt signalling pathways are known to regulate gastrulation and can downregulate e-cadherin  <cit> . further research will demonstrate whether the bmp, wnt or fgf signalling pathways are directly involved in pgc specification.

CONCLUSIONS
the recent evidence for a population of pgcs progenitors in the mouse embryo has compelled us to re-evaluate the role of the extraembryonic tissues in the formation of pgcs. using transgenic mouse models in combination with an explant-assay, we determined that the extraembryonic tissues, ve and exe, as part of their patterning role during gastrulation, are also responsible for the correct induction of pgc progenitors. however, the ve and exe do not seem to be directly involved in the specification to pgcs as expected. we support the idea that not only the ve, but also the exe is regionalized and that it is the cross talk in the proximal-posterior part of the embryo that allows the development of pgc progenitors at e <dig> –e <dig> . to date, little importance has been given to the posterior ve, in contrast to the ave. the exe and ve seem to play different roles, but both important for the normal development of pgc progenitors. finally, being a pgc progenitor is not sufficient to become a specified pgc and signals probably secreted from the exm should prove to induce pgc specification.
