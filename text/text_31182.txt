BACKGROUND
the endophytic diazotroph herbaspirillum seropedicae smr <dig> is a beta-proteobacterium found in association with economically important crops such as rice, maize, sugar cane and sorghum  <cit> . h. seropedicae can fix nitrogen under micro-oxic and nitrogen limiting conditions and expression of h. seropedicae nitrogen fixation  genes inside plant tissues has been demonstrated  <cit> . in h. seropedicae the nif genes are clustered in a contiguous region of  <dig> genes  <cit> , comprising at least seven operons  <cit> , whose products are essential for biosynthesis, maturation and assembly of the nitrogenase complex. the nitrogenase structural genes  are located in the nifhdkenxhsero2847hsero_2846fdxa operon. nifh encodes the iron  protein while nifdk encodes the molybenum-iron  protein.the nifb gene, which encodes a protein involved in the synthesis of femoco, is located in an operon with other nif-related genes. the σ54-dependent transcriptional activator, nifa, a member of the bacterial enhancer binding family  <cit>  is a master regulator of nif gene expression in h. seropedicae smr <dig>  <cit> . two sites for nifa binding and a consensus binding site for the rna polymerase σ <dig> holoenzyme were found in the promoters upstream nifb and nifh  <cit> . nifa responds to both fixed nitrogen and oxygen levels, being activated in response to limitation of these resources  <cit> . once active, nifa activates transcription from nif promoters  <cit>  including nifb and nifh .

the fnr protein, is a widespread transcriptional regulator that binds a 2+ cluster to monitor the oxygen status in the cell  <cit> , and regulates the transcription of genes required for the metabolic switch in response to decreasing oxygen levels  <cit> . orthologous proteins of the crp/fnr family  <cit>  have been previously implicated in controlling expression and/or activity of the nifa transcriptional activator in some diazotrophs  <cit> . in klebsiella pneumoniae fnr influences nifa activity through modulation of the mechanism by which the nifl repressor protein is sequestered to the membrane  <cit> . in bradyrhizobium japonicum the fnr-like protein, fixk <dig>  negatively controls genes that are subject to nifa activation  <cit>  suggesting that fixk <dig>  can repress transcription at nifa-dependent promoters. another precedent for fnr involvement in nifa activity was observed by monteiro and co-workers  <cit> , who showed that the activity of an amino-terminally truncated form of h. seropedicae nifa was influenced by fnr when expressed in an escherichia coli fnr- background.

the h. seropedicae genome  <cit>  has three genes encoding for fnr-like proteins  <cit>  and a role for these fnr orthologs in controlling the expression of the complete cytochrome c branch of the electron transport chain has been demonstrated  <cit> . in this study we aimed to investigate the potential involvement of h. seropedicae fnr proteins in the expression and activity of nifa and the consequences for transcriptional activation of other nif genes.

we found that combined deletions in both the fnr <dig> and fnr <dig> genes lead to higher expression of nifb::lacz and nifa::lacz transcriptional fusions and increased nifh transcription. we also show that the oxygen consumption rate in multiple fnr deletion strains is higher than in the wild-type, which we believe to result in either higher stability or activity of the oxygen sensitive nifa protein and consequently increased transcriptional activation of nif genes.

RESULTS
to analyze if the three fnr genes in h. seropedicae influence either the expression level or the activity of nifa, we monitored expression of a nifb::lacz fusion, as a reporter of nifa activity. we compared nifb expression in the wild-type strain  with a double deletion strain, which lacks both fnr <dig> and fnr <dig>  and a strain carrying deletions in all three fnr genes . multiple fnr deletion strains were not analysed in these experiments since single gene deletions did not influence nifa activity. as nifb gene expression is tightly regulated by nitrogen and oxygen levels in the cell  <cit> , the activity of the nifb::lacz reporter fusion is only observed when the cultures exhaust the supply of fixed nitrogen and oxygen becomes limited, as the culture reaches a high cell density. although the fnr deletions impaired growth under these conditions as observed previously  <cit> , the activity of the nifb::lacz fusion was significantly higher after 12– <dig> hours incubation in the strain lacking both fnr <dig> and fnr <dig>  and also in the triple fnr deletion strain  when compared with the wild-type . this suggests that either nifa expression or its activity is more highly induced in cultures of these multiple fnr deletion strains.figure  <dig> the nifb gene expression is enhanced in the fnr mutant strains from h. seropedicae.
 the activity of the nifb::lacz fusion  was assayed using cells cultured in nfbhp-malate liquid medium supplemented with 5 mm nh4cl . every two hours samples were taken for determination of β-galactosidase activity of the wild type strain  , the double fnr <dig> and fnr <dig> deletion strain   and the triple fnr deletion strain  . samples were also taken for measuring the growth  of the strains smr <dig> , mb <dig>  and mb <dig> .  activity of the nifb::lacz fusion measured under the initial oxygen concentrations of  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in liquid medium without addition of fixed nitrogen as describe in methods.

we considered the possibility that the multiple fnr deletion strains exhaust dissolved oxygen in the media faster than the wild type strain, thus leading to higher activity or stability of nifa in cultures of the fnr deletion mutants. to examine this further, we assayed nifb::lacz activity in cultures grown in the absence of fixed nitrogen under defined initial oxygen concentrations of oxygen in the gas phase . as anticipated, nifb expression was not detected under either 8% or  <dig> % oxygen in both wild-type and the fnr triple deletion mutant, presumably because h. seropedicae nifa is inactivated at high oxygen concentrations  <cit> . however, the activity of the nifb::lacz promoter fusion was markedly higher in the triple fnr deletion strain  compared with the parental strain, when cultures were incubated under an initial oxygen concentration of 4% or 6% in the gas phase . to ensure that the increase of nifb expression observed in the mutant strains was nifa-dependent, we prepared single nifa− and multiple deletion strains carrying a nifa deletion in addition to the fnr mutations  and confirmed that the influence of fnr proteins on nifb promoter activation requires nifa protein .

since expression of the nifa gene itself is subject to autoactivation in h. seropedicae  <cit> , we tested the influence of fnr deletions on nifa expression using various nifa::lacz promoter constructs . transcriptional regulation of nifa is complex, since this σ54-dependent promoter is subject to nitrogen regulation by the enhancer binding protein ntrc in addition to autogenous activation by nifa under oxygen-limiting conditions . notably, single deletions in each of the three fnr genes had no apparent influence on nifa expression. however, as in the case of nifb, an increase in promoter activation was apparent in the double fnr <dig>  fnr <dig> deletion mutant  and the triple fnr deletion strain  . in all cases, promoter activation significantly decreased when cultures were grown in the presence of a high concentration of fixed nitrogen , or when the − <dig> to − <dig> region of the promoter was disrupted , indicating that activation is rpon-dependent and subject to nitrogen regulation by ntrc as expected  <cit> . in all cases, irrespective of the presence of fnr mutations, nifa expression decreased when promoter constructs  carried mutations in the upstream activation sequence  of the promoter , presumably as a consequence of decreased autoactivation by nifa  <cit> . overall, these results demonstrate that in the absence of both fnr <dig> and fnr <dig>  activation of the nifa promoter is increased. since higher expression of the nifa::lacz fusion is not observed when the nifa binding site  is deleted, it is likely that the increased expression results from autoactivation of the nifa promoter due to increased activity or stability of nifa protein.

given that the nifa promoter is subjected to complex regulation, we designed experiments to confirm that nifa activity is enhanced in fnr mutant strains. firstly, using the combined fnr− and nifa deletion strains described above  we complemented the nifa mutation with nifa expressed ectopically from the lac promoter , which is constitutive in h. seropedicae. in this complementation assay we observed that the levels of nifh mrna were higher in the fnr deletion strains complemented with constitutively expressed nifa in comparison with the complemented strain containing wild-type fnr alleles . this implies that an increase in nifa activity, rather than its expression, is responsible for increased activation of nif promoters in the fnr deletion mutants. secondly, we constructed strains expressing nifa fused to a 3xflag peptide to allow detection of the protein in both wild type and fnr mutant backgrounds . western blots of strains carrying the nifa-3xflag allele revealed higher levels of nifa expression in the double fnr <dig>  fnr <dig> deletion  and also in the triple fnr deletion  backgrounds compared with the strain carrying wild-type fnr alleles  . this confirms the additional level of autoactivation of the nifa promoter conferred by the multiple fnr deletions , again indicating that nifa activity is higher in the fnr mutant strains.figure  <dig> the nifa activity is higher in h. seropedicae strains lacking both fnr <dig> and fnr <dig>  the rna from the strains mbn <dig> , mbn <dig>  and mbn <dig>  complemented with the plasmid pramm <dig>  was purified and submitted to direct rt-pcr amplification of nifh gene as described in methods. the 16s rrna  was used as an endogenous expression control. a representative gel from two independent rna extractions is showed.



as the h. seropedicae nifa protein is sensitive to oxygen, being inactivated and degraded upon exposure to o <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesized that nifa might be protected in its active form in fnr deletion strains if these strains exhibit a higher oxygen consumption rate. to further test this hypothesis we measured oxygen depletion during the growth of bacterial cultures in the same growth conditions as described for the assay of the nifa::lacz fusions. we first analyzed the decrease in oxygen concentration in the gas phase of suba-seal stoppered flasks  and additionally compared the profiles of dissolved oxygen consumption using a clark type electrode . these assays revealed that the consumption of oxygen was higher in multiple fnr deletion strains, implying that these strains have a higher respiratory rate when compared to the wild type . notably, the oxygen consumption data in figure 5a directly correlates with the increased activity of nifa observed in strains lacking both fnr <dig> and fnr <dig>  implying that the absence of both these transcription factors results in higher respiration rates.figure  <dig> the oxygen consumption rate is higher in the h. seropedicae fnr mutant strains.  gas phase oxygen consumption in h. seropedicae smr <dig> and fnr mutant strains.  consumption of dissolved oxygen in liquid media of h. seropedicae strains smr <dig>  and mb <dig>  using a clark-type electrode. the arrow indicates addition of 100 μl of cells into the electrode chamber containing  <dig>  ml of nfbhp-malate supplemented with  <dig>  mm of ammonium chloride. the inset shows the specific oxygen uptake rate  in liquid cultures, which was calculated considering the oxygen solubility in water as 233 μm  <cit> . the asterisks indicate statistical significance according to the student’s t-test , derived from two independent experiments.



in a previous study, we showed that the triple fnr mutant is deficient in the expression of the cytochrome c-type branch of the electron transport chain  <cit> . an alternative route of electron transport from the quinol pool to oxygen via the terminal quinol oxidases is likely to occur in the triple fnr mutant. as the quinol branch of the respiratory chain results in a lower number of proton-translocation events it is conceivable that the activity of this branch, rather than the expression of the bo <dig> and bd-type oxidases, is enhanced in the fnr mutant strains to compensate for the lower level of energy production. this may result in increased electron flux through the respiratory chain and hence enhanced oxygen consumption as observed in our experiments.

we demonstrated previously that nitrogenase activity is severely impaired when the triple fnr deletion strain is cultured in ammonium-limiting liquid medium, potentially as a consequence of energy depletion  <cit> . we also showed that diazotrophic growth is impaired in the fnr ablated strain, after subjecting cultures to severe nitrogen starvation  <cit> . under these conditions, cultures divide at extremely low growth rates, requiring 24 days post-inoculation to achieve an od <dig> of ~  <dig>  . however, it is notable that the triple fnr mutant grew faster than the wild-type for the first 12 days of incubation under these conditions. potentially, the enhanced rate of o <dig> consumption by the triple fnr deletion allows higher levels of nifa activity and consequently higher nitrogenase activity during the ‘early’ stages of growth. however, it is possible that as the bacterial population increases and the oxygen levels in the culture drop further, the triple fnr mutant strain can no longer maintain the necessary electron flux to support nitrogenase activity and as a consequence, diazotrophic growth is impaired.

in summary, these studies have not identified a direct role for the h. seropedicae fnr proteins in regulating nifa activity and nitrogen fixation, but rather suggest that they may influence both, by means of altering the composition of the electron transport chain and the oxygen consumption rate. since we only observe such effects in strains deleted for both fnr <dig> and fnr <dig>  there is apparently some redundancy in the physiological functions of the three fnr paralogs in h. seropedicae. it is feasible that h. seropedicae can take advantage of the three fnr genes to differentially modulate respiratory chain composition. this is likely to influence nitrogen fixation during different phases of growth and enable efficient adaptation during plant-bacterial colonization.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have used a combination of transcriptional and physiological approaches to address the role of the h. seropedicae fnr proteins in influencing the expression and activity of nifa. in summary we found that fnr <dig> and fnr <dig> participate indirectly in modulating nifa stability as a consequence of alterations in the rate of o <dig> consumption. this mechanism can potentially allow the bacteria to fine tune nitrogen fixation in response to environmental cues.
