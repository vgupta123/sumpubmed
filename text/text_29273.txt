BACKGROUND
cd <dig>  a  <dig> kda type ii membrane protein expressed on b cells, is an inhibitory co-receptor that regulates signaling through the b cell antigen receptor   <cit> . both human and mouse cd <dig> contains a c-type lectin-like domain in the extracellular region and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif  in the cytoplamic region  <cit> . mouse cd <dig> negatively regulates bcr signaling by recruiting src homology  <dig> domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase- <dig>  at itim  <cit> . however, the signaling function of human cd <dig> remains unknown.

four human cd <dig> polymorphisms have been identified in the upstream regulatory region and introns  <cit> . these cd <dig> polymorphisms constitute two major haplotypes, cd72* <dig> and cd72* <dig>  we previously demonstrated that fcgr2b-ile232thr, a gene polymorphism of fcγriib, is significantly associated with sle in asian populations, and is a risk factor for sle only in individuals with cd72*1/ <dig> <cit> . this finding indicates that cd72* <dig> confers resistance to sle in individuals carrying fcgr2b-ile232thr. two polymorphisms in intron  <dig> regulate generation of an alternative splicing isoform  that skips exon  <dig> independently; probably act in combination as cis-acting intronic splicing enhancer  or silencer   <cit> . exon  <dig> encodes the c-terminal part of the c-type lectin-like domain and the stop codon, and skipping of it results in replacement of the c-terminal part of the c-type lectin-like domain by a sequence encoded in exon  <dig> in cd72Δex <dig>  the ratio of mrna level of cd72Δex <dig> to that of full-length cd <dig>  is strikingly higher in b cells from individuals with the cd72*2/ <dig> or cd72*1/ <dig> genotype than in those with cd72*1/ <dig> <cit> . because there are no substitutions in exons among different cd <dig> haplotypes, these findings strongly suggest that increased cd72Δex <dig> level, decreased cd72fl level, or both are responsible for the resistance of cd72*2-carrying individuals to sle.

in the present study, we addressed the functional properties of cd <dig> isoforms. analysis of healthy individuals revealed that those with cd72* <dig> express a significantly lower level of the cd72Δex <dig> protein in b cells, and show the higher level of serum immunoglobulins than those carrying cd72* <dig>  suggesting that cd72Δex <dig> regulates the immunoglobulin level as well susceptibility to sle. analysis using b cell transfectants expressing cd72Δex <dig> demonstrated that cd72Δex <dig> does not regulate bcr signaling but accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum . thus, the cd <dig> polymorphism regulates antibody production and autoimmunity by modulating the level of er-localizing cd72Δex <dig> 

methods
plasmids
cdnas including the entire coding region of human cd72fl or cd72Δex <dig> but not nucleotides for the stop codon were obtained by rt-pcr from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  with a pair of specific primers . the cdnas encoding cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig> were inserted with a pair of oligonucleotides encoding flag-tag into the retrovirus expression vector pmx-ires-gfp, and the resulting plasmids were termed pmx-cd72fl and pmx-cd72Δex <dig>  respectively.

the retrovirus expression plasmids pmx-cd72flyf and pmx-cd72Δex8yf encoding the mutants of cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig>  in which tyrosine <dig> is replaced by phenylalanine, were generated by pcr-based site-directed mutagenesis using a specific primer set .

cells
the mouse b cell lines wehi- <dig> and k46μv and the human b cell line raji were described previously  <cit> , and cultured in rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fcs,  <dig> μm 2-me, and  <dig> mm glutamine. the mouse fibroblast cell line balb/c-3t <dig> was cultured in dmem medium supplemented with 10% fcs and  <dig> mm glutamine. retrovirus-mediated gene transfer was performed as described previously  <cit> .

pbmcs were obtained from unrelated healthy japanese living in the central part of japan where genetic background is shown to be relatively homogeneous  <cit> . informed consents were obtained from these indiciduals prior to collecting samples. peripheral b lymphocytes were isolated from pbmcs by an automacs cell sorter  using the b cell isolation kit ii. this study was approved by the research ethics committees of the graduate school of medicine, the university of tokyo.

genotyping
human cd <dig> haplotype was determined by genotyping cd72-vntr, the tag polymorphism, by pcr-sslp method as described previously  <cit> . fcgr2b-ile232thr was genotyped by nested pcr and fluorescence resonance energy transfer  technology as described previously  <cit> .

serum igg level
serum igg levels in healthy individuals were measured by turbidimetric immunoassay.

flow cytometry
peripheral blood b cells were incubated with fitc-labeled anti-human cd <dig> mab j4- <dig> . b cell transfectants were incubated with rabbit anti-flag ab , followed by reaction with pe-labeled goat anti-rabbit igg . alternatively, transfectants were stained with np-conjugated pe. cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using a facscalibur .

generation of anti-cd72Δex <dig> antibody
rabbits were immunized with the peptide specific for cd72Δex <dig> , and serum igg was purified from rabbit serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation. the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by western blotting of total cell lysates of cos- <dig> cd72Δex <dig> transfectant using pre-immune and immune serum.

immunoprecipitation and western blotting
cells were stimulated with either  <dig>  μg/ml np15-coupled bsa  or  <dig> μg/ml anti-igm ab, and were lysed in triton x- <dig> lysis buffer  <cit> . lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag ab  together with protein g-sepharose . total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on sds-page and were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine mab 4g <dig> , anti-β-tubulin mab tub <dig>  , rabbit anti-flag ab, rabbit anti-cd <dig> ab , rabbit anti-phospho erk ab , rabbit anti-shp- <dig> ab , or rabbit anti-cd72Δex <dig> ab. proteins were visualized with an ecl system.

cells were incubated in culture medium containing  <dig> μg/ml fluo-4-am  for  <dig> min. cells were stimulated with  <dig>  μg/ml np-bsa, and were analyzed by flow cytometry using a facscalibur.

assay of apoptotic cells
cells were incubated with thapsigargin or staurosporine for  <dig> h and  <dig> h, and cells containing hypodiploid dna were measured by flow cytometry  <cit> .

immunocytochemistry
cells were fixed in 4% pfa for  <dig> min, washed with pbs, and permeabilized with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> for  <dig> min. cells were then washed with pbs, blocked with 2% bsa for  <dig> min, and stained for flag-tagged human cd <dig> and organelle-specific marker proteins in er, mitochondria, golgi apparatus, early endosomes, and late endosomes using rabbit anti-flag ab, anti-kdel mab 10c <dig> , anti-cytochrome c mab 6h <dig> b <dig> , anti-gm <dig> mab  <dig> , anti-transferrin receptor mab h <dig>  , and anti-lamp <dig> mab 1d4b , respectively. cells were then analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy .

statistical analysis
the serum igg level among cd <dig> genotypes was analyzed using regression analysis and kruskal-wallis rank sum test. relative expression of cd72Δex <dig> protein product between cd <dig> genotype was analyzed using mann–whitney u test. otherwise, student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis.

RESULTS
decreased serum immunoglobulin levels in cd72*2-carrying individuals
to address whether the cd <dig> polymorphism regulates humoral immunity, we measured the serum igg levels in  <dig> healthy volunteers. we genotyped cd <dig> ivs8-vntr which was the tag polymorphism for human cd <dig> haplotypes by pcr–simple sequence length polymorphism  method  <cit> , and there were the total of  <dig> with cd72*1/ <dig>  the total of  <dig> with cd72*1/ <dig>  and the total of  <dig> with cd72*2/ <dig>  the serum igg level inversely correlated to the number of cd72* <dig> allele with statistical significance . additionally, we genotyped fcgr2b-ile232thr by nested pcr and fluorescence resonance energy transfer  technology in the same volunteers  <cit> . there was however no significant difference in the serum igg level among fcgr2b-ile232thr genotypes . thus, cd <dig> polymorphism appears to play a role in the regulation of antibody production.

human cd72fl but not cd72Δex <dig> regulates bcr signaling
to assess the signaling function of both human cd72fl and the cd72Δex <dig> isoforms, we constructed retroviral vectors containing flag-tagged cd72fl, cd72Δex <dig> isoform, or their yf mutants in which the tyrosine residue at itim was replaced by phenylalanine. although bcr ligation by antigen but not anti-ig antibody induces efficient mouse cd72-mediated bcr regulation through recruitment of shp- <dig>  human b cell lines including raji and ramos exhibited reduced shp- <dig> expression  <cit> , and expressed endogenous cd <dig> and bcr with unknown antigen specificity  <cit> . we therefore transduced these retroviral vectors into the mouse b cell line k46μv, which we used to examine the signaling function of mouse cd <dig> because of its expression of bcr reactive to the hapten  acetyl  without endogenous cd <dig> expression  <cit> . all the k46μv transfectants expressed similar levels of np-reactive bcr , and bcr ligation by a specific antigen np-bsa induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and ca2+ influx . however, both erk phosphorylation and ca2+ influx induced by antigen stimulation were decreased in k46μv cd72fl transfectants compared to k46μv cells transduced with vector alone  , indicating that cd72fl negatively regulates bcr signaling. in contrast, neither erk phosphorylation nor ca2+ flux was decreased in k46μv transfectants that express the yf mutant of cd72fl  , indicating that cd72fl-induced bcr regulation depends on its itim. accordingly, cd72fl but not cd72flyf was markedly phosphorylated and associated with shp- <dig> after antigen stimulation . human cd72fl thus negatively regulates bcr signaling in mouse b cells by recruiting shp- <dig> at the phosphorylated itim, as is the case for mouse cd <dig>  <cit> .

in k46μv transfectants, surface expression of cd72Δex <dig> isoform was much lower than that of cd72fl , although the amount of cd72Δex <dig> in total cell lysates was much larger than that of cd72fl , suggesting poor efficiency of transport of cd72Δex <dig> to the cell surface. equivalent erk phosphorylation and ca2+ influx by np-bsa treatment in k46μv cd72Δex <dig> cells indicate that cd72Δex <dig> does not regulate bcr signaling. cd72Δex <dig> is thus poorly expressed on the cell surface and does not regulate bcr signaling.

increased cd72Δex <dig> expression in cd72*2-carrying peripheral b-cells
since the ratio of cd72Δex <dig> mrna to cd72fl mrna is increased in b cells from cd72*2-carrying individuals resistant to sle  <cit> , we next determined the protein levels of endogenous cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig> in human primary b cells. when we examined the surface expression of cd <dig> by flow cytometry using an anti-cd <dig> antibody that reacts to both cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig>  peripheral blood b cells from healthy individuals carrying cd72*1/ <dig>  cd72*1/ <dig>  or cd72*2/ <dig> exhibited similar levels of surface cd <dig> expression . this finding suggests that expression of cd72fl does not differ among various cd <dig> haplotypes because cd72Δex <dig> is only poorly expressed on the surface. to examine the cd72Δex <dig> level, we generated polyclonal antibodies that recognize cd72Δex <dig> but not cd72fl, and measured the protein levels of cd72Δex <dig> corrected for the level of β-tubulin. the cd72Δex <dig> levels in peripheral blood b cells carrying cd72* <dig> including both cd72*1/ <dig> and cd72*2/ <dig> were significantly higher than those carrying cd72*1/ <dig> . taken together, these findings indicate that b cells carrying cd72* <dig>  a haplotype protective against sle, express higher levels of cd72Δex <dig> whereas levels of cd72fl were similar regardless of the number of cd72* <dig>  increase in the cd72Δex <dig> level is thus responsible for cd72*2-mediated resistance to sle, although cd72Δex <dig> does not regulate bcr signaling.

cd72Δex <dig> accumulates in er
since cd72Δex <dig> is poorly expressed on the cell surface, we next examined the intracellular localization of cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig> by confocal microscopy. in mouse b-cell line wehi- <dig> transfectants, cd72Δex <dig> was accumulated inside the cells, though its location was unclear due to the relatively small cytoplasm . to determine intracellular localization in detail, we then transduced retroviral vectors encoding cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig> into balb/c-3t <dig> cells, which contain much larger cytoplasm than b lymphocytes. fluorescence for cd <dig> was much stronger in cd72Δex <dig> transfectants than in cd72fl transfectants, indicating that cd72Δex <dig> is accumulated inside the cells . we therefore amplified the fluorescence intensity of cd72fl to the levels of cd72Δex <dig>  and compared the intracellular localization of these proteins. both cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig> were localized in er, mitochondria, golgi apparatus, early endosomes, and late endosomes, which are reasonable locations for membrane proteins . however, cd72Δex <dig> was strongly accumulated in er compared to cd72fl .

eukaryotic cells react rapidly to dysfunction of the er through a set of evolutionarily conserved adaptive pathways known as the unfolded protein response , and persistent or intense er stress triggers apoptosis  <cit> . to obtain additional evidence for er localization of cd72Δex <dig>  we addressed whether cd72Δex <dig> augments er stress-mediated apoptosis. expression of flag-tagged cd72Δex <dig> but not cd72fl enhanced apoptosis of mouse b cell line wehi- <dig> and human b cell line raji induced by thapsigargin, which generates er stress by depletion of ca2+ from er  <cit>  . in contrast, cd72Δex <dig> did not augment apoptosis of wehi- <dig> transfectants induced by treatment with staurosporine, which induces apoptosis by mitochondrial stress  <cit>  . thus, cd72Δex <dig> specifically enhances er stress-induced apoptosis.

discussion
here we addressed humoral immunity and expression of the two isoforms of human cd <dig>  i.e., cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig>  in healthy individuals carrying different cd <dig> haplotypes as the coding sequences of these isoforms were the same regardless of different cd <dig> haplotypes. individuals carrying higher numbers of cd72* <dig> allele showed lower serum levels of igg, clearly demonstrating association of, cd72* <dig> with low serum ig as well as reduced risk for sle  <cit> . the cell surface expression level of cd72fl on peripheral b cells was similar regardless of the number of cd72* <dig> allele. this is in agreement with the previous study in which flow cytometry demonstrated relatively homogeneous cd <dig> expression on b cell surface in healthy individuals  <cit> . thus, bcr signal regulation mediated by cd72fl in b cells does not differ among each cd <dig> genotypes because bcr regulation appears to occur on the cell surface. in contrast, individuals carrying higher numbers of cd72* <dig> allele showed higher levels of cd72Δex <dig> in peripheral b cells. although the sample size of this analysis is relatively small, this result is in agreement with our previous study with a larger sample size  demonstrating that the ratio of cd72Δex <dig> to cd72fl mrna correlates to the number of cd72* <dig> allele  <cit> , and suggests that presence of cd72* <dig> allele increases the protein level of cd72Δex <dig> but not cd72fl. taken together, cd72Δex <dig> but not cd72fl is responsible for difference in serum ig and risk for sle among individuals carrying different cd <dig> genotypes.

we further examined the functional activity of cd72fl and cd72Δex <dig>  in signal regulation and cellular localization by expressing these isoforms in mouse b cell lines k46μv and wehi- <dig>  human b cell line raji and fibroblasts. as is the case for mouse cd <dig>  cd72fl negatively regulated bcr signaling in itim-dependent fashion. in contrast, cd72Δex <dig> did not regulate bcr signaling, probably due to its poor surface expression. cd72Δex <dig> was accumulated in er in fibroblasts and augmented apoptosis induced by er-stress in wehi- <dig> and raji, demonstrating er localization of cd72Δex <dig>  thus, er-localizing cd72Δex <dig> is responsible for the regulation of antibody production as well as susceptibility to sle mediated by cd <dig> polymorphism.

cd72Δex <dig> is generated by alternative splicing that skips exon  <dig>  causing replacement of an exon 8-encoded stretch of  <dig> amino acids in the c-type lectin domain in the extracellular region by a totally different sequence of  <dig> amino acids encoded by exon  <dig>  <cit> . this extensive change in the extracellular c-type lectin domain may cause accumulation of cd72Δex <dig> in er. the change in the c-type lectin domain may induce misfolding of the cd72Δex <dig> protein, which causes er retention of the protein. splicing isoforms of surface proteins such as human fcγrib, mouse glutamate receptor 7b , and rat voltage-dependent and ca2+−activated k+ channel  are mostly retained in the er  <cit> . whether these er-localized isoforms play a role in cellular functions need to be elucidated in future studies.

we previously demonstrated that cd72* <dig> specifically abrogates the susceptibility to sle conferred by the allele of fcγriib carrying the substitution of 232ile by 232thr   <cit> , which is suggested to reduce the inhibitory function of fcγriib  <cit> . fcγriib-deficient mice exhibit loss of b cell self-tolerance at the igg+ b cell and plasma cell stages, and development of sle-like disease  <cit> , demonstrating that fcγriib provides a distal peripheral checkpoint limiting the accumulation of self-reactive plasma cells and thereby preventing sle. the ile232thr substitution may thus reduce the activity of fcγriib in maintaining self-tolerance, and thereby increase risk for sle. our findings suggest that cd72* <dig> augments apoptosis of b cells by enhancing expression of cd72Δex <dig> . augmented b cell apoptosis may reduce the number of self-reactive b cells, and autoantibody-producing plasma cells may not be generated at high frequency in cd72*2-carrying individuals even in the presence of inefficient self-tolerance caused by fcgr2b-ile232thr. recently, over  <dig> loci were reported as the genes significantly associated with susceptibility to sle by genome-wide association study   <cit> . however, most of these loci carry very small effect, and the proportion of heritability explained by these variants is modest  <cit> . other than the effect of causal rare variant, it is possible to explain a part of “missing heritability” by the gene-gene interaction. this study, which shows the functional interaction between cd <dig> and fcgr2b, will be a functional evidence of such a gene-gene interaction.

increasing numbers of studies have identified disease-susceptibility alleles associated with specific splicing patterns  <cit> . our previous  <cit>  and the present studies have demonstrated that the genetic polymorphism of human cd <dig> associated with susceptibility to sle regulates the efficiency of alternative splicing, although how the polymorphism affects alternative splicing is not known. further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of splice variations and their functional significance will provide important clues to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and development of new therapeutic approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
our finding that serum igg levels in individuals carrying the cd72* <dig> allele including both individuals with cd72*1/ <dig> and those with cd72*2/ <dig> are significantly lower than those in individuals carrying cd72*1/ <dig> clearly demonstrates that human cd <dig> polymorphism regulates humoral immunity as well as risk for sle  <cit> . of the two splicing isoforms of human cd <dig>  cd72Δex <dig> appears to be responsible for the regulation of ig production and autoimmunity, as the expression level of cd72Δex <dig> but not the other isoform cd72fl is different between b cells from individuals with cd72* <dig> and those with cd72*1/ <dig>  because cd72Δex <dig> is accumulated in er and poorly transported to the cell surface, cd72Δex <dig> may regulate b cell activity by a mechanism distinct from cd72fl that is expressed on the surface and regulate signaling through bcr as is the case for mouse cd <dig>  although overexpression of cd72Δex <dig> enhances er stress-induced apoptosis, further studies are required to elucidate how cd72Δex <dig> in er regulates b cell activity.
