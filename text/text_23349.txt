BACKGROUND
mosquito immune responses to plasmodium play an important role in the natural control of the infection and are initiated when pathogen-associated molecular patterns  are recognized by pattern recognition receptor  molecules  <cit> . peptidoglycan recognition proteins  are one family of prr, which contain a domain very similar to bacterial amidase. the anopheles pgrps can be divided into two different classes: short and long. in drosophila short pgrps are small extracellular proteins about  <dig> amino acids long and 18- <dig> kda that are present in the hemolymph and cuticle. they are constitutively synthesized or induced mainly in the fat-body and, to a lesser extent, also in the epidermal cells, in the gut and in the hemocytes. long pgrps, have long transcripts and are either intracellular or membrane-spanning proteins, expressed mainly in the hemocytes  <cit> . seven pgrp genes are known in the anopheles gambiae genome  <cit> . of these, three genes code for the short pgrps namely pgrp-s <dig>  pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig>  short-pgrp genes from an. gambiae differ in their structure, as pgrp-s <dig> and s <dig> have predicted amidase activity while pgrp-s <dig> does not. the presence of catalytic activity in drosophila short-pgrps determines its function. drosophila has two noncatalytic short-pgrps, pgrp-sa and pgrp-sd, which are involved in recognition of bacteria and activation of the toll pathway  <cit> , while pgrp-sc1/ <dig> have catalytic activity and can specifically control the level of activation of the imd signalling pathway  <cit> . transcription alteration of short-pgrps in response to plasmodium infection  <cit>  have been reported. however, the way these molecules are involved in the response to the parasite remains unknown. the most plausible explanation in view of recent findings  <cit>  is that gut microbiota modulate mosquito response to plasmodium.

pgrp genes form clusters in the genome suggesting that they may have been originated by gene duplication  <cit> . this phenomenon is also observed in other prr, like tep- <dig>  in which gene conversion plays a determinant role on their evolution  <cit> . the reasons why duplications occur are diverse. once a gene is duplicated, the new gene might degenerate into a pseudogene due to recurrent deleterious mutations. however, if the duplication is advantageous for the organism, the gene might evolve new functions  since the first copy maintains the original function. in addition duplicated genes can also have the same function but which is partially or fully subdivided between them .

molecular evolution of immune related genes is determined by their interaction with pathogens. in the present study we analysed patterns of evolution in three short pgrps of the malaria vectors an. gambiae and anopheles arabiensis, the main malaria vectors in sub-sahara africa, and considered the type of selective pressure acting on them.

RESULTS
polymorphism and diversity
a total of  <dig> sequences were analysed,  <dig> from an. gambiae  and  <dig> from an. arabiensis. eighty eight sequences were obtained for pgrp-s <dig> ,  <dig> for pgrp-s <dig>  and  <dig> for pgrp-s <dig> . there were  <dig> an. gambiae and  <dig> an. arabiensis for which all three genes were successfully sequenced.

in the pgrp-s <dig> gene, a fragment of  <dig> bp that includes the coding region  was amplified. for this gene the nucleotide diversity  was higher for an. arabiensis from mozambique than in the other groups especially in the 5' upstream and 3' downstream non-coding regions  . overall nucleotide diversity was lower for pgrp-s <dig>  when compared to pgrp-s <dig>  and pgrp-s <dig> .

a total of  <dig> bp was amplified in the pgrp-s <dig> gene, which included the coding region . in this gene the π values varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the coding region and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the non-coding regions . for pgrp-s <dig> gene a fragment of  <dig> bp, that included the coding region , was amplified. the π values varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the coding-region and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the non-coding regions.

for the three genes the total number of segregating sites was estimated for each geographic sample . these were very similar in pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> genes, and much higher than in pgrp-s <dig>  the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions was always higher in pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> genes than in pgrp-s <dig> and for those two genes synonymous changes were always higher than nonsynonymous changes. this is reflected in the πa/πs ratios that were always below one .

species divergence and population differentiation
species divergence and population differentiation were calculated for each gene of an. gambiae and an. arabiensis from two different east-africa locations, tanzania and mozambique.

for the pgrp-s <dig> gene all pairwise fst estimates were significant . the lowest fst estimates were obtained in intraspecific comparisons, indicating that differentiation was higher between species than between geographic populations . for the other two genes within and between species fst estimates were lower but still significant in almost all comparisons made . exceptions were for pgrp-s <dig> gene between an. gambiae_tanzania and an. gambiae_mozambique; an. arabiensis_tanzania and an. arabiensis_mozambique and for pgrp-s <dig> gene between an. arabiensis_tanzania and an. gambiae_mozambique.

to better understand the relationship between species and geographic regions, a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance  was performed . for pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> genes most of the variation was distributed within populations, but for pgrp-s <dig> the remaining variation was distributed between species. these results corroborate the previous analyses indicating that for this gene the major variation occurred between species and not between different geographic regions.

phylogeny
the median-joining network based on the pgrp-s <dig> haplotypes showed a clear interspecific separation . each species presented one haplotype at a higher frequency, 5-1_am for an. arabiensis and 83c_gt for an. gambiae. both were present in the  <dig> geographic regions and probably correspond to the ancestral haplotype. for an. arabiensis the other  <dig> haplotypes were unique for each geographic sample. in an. gambiae a lower number of haplotypes was found  and a second haplotype was shared by the an. gambiae - mozambique and an. gambiae - tanzania populations.

the network based on the pgrp-s <dig> haplotypes  showed a higher number of haplotypes when compared to the pgrp-s <dig> network , and the separation between species was not as clear as in the network of the pgrp-s <dig>  there was a single high frequency haplotype, 5-6_am, that was shared by more than one population and by both species. all the other haplotypes were unique for each population and species, and showed low frequency. all  <dig> low-frequency haplotypes specific of an. arabiensis were more closely related in the network. for an. gambiae,  <dig> haplotypes grouped together in the network but two  were closer to an. arabiensis haplotypes.

the network based on pgrp-s <dig> haplotypes was the most complex. as illustrated in figure 1c, this network presented a high number of haplotypes . most of the haplotypes were unique, although  <dig> of them were shared between species and three between geographic populations within an. gambiae. no clear separation was observed either between species or between geographic regions. a network based on pooled pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> haplotypes showed interspecific common haplotypes between these two genes , namely the most frequent haplotype 2-7_gm and another  <dig> less frequent . all remaining haplotypes were exclusive.

another network based on pooled an. gambiae and an. arabiensis haplotypes   was made to evaluate if clustering was predominately due to species or to homologous loci, in order to infer for concerted evolution. in case of concerted evolution we would expect that pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> would be more similar within the same species than to the homologous gene in the other species. this was not observed suggesting that gene conversion between pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> is not a major determinant of diversity of these genes.

tests for selection
for the three short pgrps genes, neutrality tests were performed for each of the four populations separately. the tajima's d test detected one gene, pgrp-s <dig>  with significant departure from neutrality in the an. gambiae-tanzania population. for the other genes, the results were consistent with neutral evolution . similarly, in fu & li's d and f tests only the pgrp-s <dig> gene showed a significant departure from neutrality for an. gambiae-tanzania population. tests for departure from neutrality can be affected by various factors such as population expansion, which would result in negative tajima d values for all loci. however, since only one gene displayed this pattern, population expansion is thus unlikely

synonymous  and nonsynonymous  nucleotide diversity was calculated for each gene within each group  revealing values below one for pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig>  suggesting purifying selection . a fisher's exact test of neutrality based on the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between sequence pairs of an. gambiae and an. arabiensis was conducted in mega  <dig>   <cit>  for each collection site. p-values were equal to one for the vast majority of pairwise comparisons confirming purifying selection . evidence of purifying selection was also confirmed by synonymous  and nonsynonymous  divergence rates. interspecific comparisons had ka/ks ratios lower than one for the three genes, particularly for pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig>  which is compatible with purifying selection .

* ka and ks were estimated by dnasp  <dig>   <cit>  for the total coding regions

protein diversity
there were  <dig> types of proteins present in our sample  representing  <dig> individuals, six different protein sequences for pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> and two that were shared by both genes. an. arabiensis had more protein sequences at lower frequencies while the opposite was observed in an. gambiae. the most frequent proteins were those shared by both species  .

the phylogenetic analysis using different methods  show the same structure . an isolated branch corresponding to pgrp-s <dig> type  <dig> was always present and was the only one with a bootstrap confidence above 70% .

sequences were allocated to each protein type  and protein types associated to haplotypes in the network  revealing that the most isolated cluster of the network correspond to protein type  <dig> while haplotypes clustered at the opposite corner are associated with protein type  <dig> 

in order to understand if different protein sequences for pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> display different 3d configurations, proteins were modelled and visualized with the swiss-pdb viewer v.  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . the best fitting 3d model for pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> was based on the crystal structure of the human pgrp-iα . the homology model shows the presence of three α helices, five β strands and coils .

amino acid substitutions were mainly present at the periphery in coils. the exception was pgrp-s <dig> type  <dig> that presented  <dig> substitutions  in α <dig> helices and  <dig> in α <dig> helices . no mutations were present in the β strands or at the recognition sites.

for pgrp-s <dig> there were  <dig> protein types, one corresponding to an. arabiensis and another to an. gambiae . the 3d model showed that the amino acid substitutions between the species were also observed at the α <dig> helices .

discussion
nucleotide diversity estimated for the three short pgrp genes was comparable with other studies made on immune related genes of drosophila and anopheles  <cit> . cohuet et al.  <cit>  analysed  <dig> immune related genes of an. gambiae among them pgrp-s <dig>  the nucleotide diversity  found for this gene for an. gambiae s form was  <dig> ; twice as high as the maximum value found in our study. this may relate to differences in geographic location. although differences were not observed when we compared mozambique and tanzania a greater geographical separation could account for differences in genetic diversity between east and west african samples  <cit> .

some differences were found in the three genes studied: pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> revealed higher nucleotide diversities when compared to pgrp-s <dig>  with respect to species divergence and population differentiation, once again pgrp-s <dig> differed from the others. fst values and amova indicated a clear separation between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis for pgrp-s <dig> gene, which was not observed for the other genes. the phylogenetic networks reinforced the results obtained by the amova and fst values. the different patterns observed between the three genes may be due to their location on the genome. pgrp-s <dig> gene is located in the chromosome x  and pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> are located in the chromosome 2l . an. gambiae and an. arabiensis display species-specific paracentric inversion arrangements xag and xbcd, respectively at the chromosome x. this should contribute to a higher differentiation between the two species at this chromosome due to reduced recombination in the case of rare hybridization between the two species. a recent study has shown that introgressed alleles between an. arabiensis and an. gambiae in the chromosome x were lost in two generations but introgressed alleles were not lost at loci located in the autosomic chromosome 2l  <cit> . this may explain the higher genetic divergence between species found in pgrp-s <dig> compared to the other two short pgrps analysed. on the other hand, pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> showed no clear separation between species suggesting either retention of ancestral polymorphism or introgression between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis. introgression of genes in autosomal chromosomes through rare hybridisation between these two sibling species has been demonstrated previously, particularly for chromosome 2l  <cit> .

prgp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> are duplicated genes that are physically close  at chromosome 2l http://www.ensembl.org/anopheles_gambiae and their coding region have 95% homology. these two genes are both considered functional, since the ratio ka/ks presents values much lower than  <dig>   <cit>  and seem to be under purifying selection. this suggests subfunctionalization, i.e., these genes share the same or very similar functions. neofunctionalization has been normally accepted has the terminal fate of duplicated genes. however more recently gibson & goldberg  <cit>  suggest that this might not be a dominant mechanism of protein evolution.

this agrees with the 3d models of the protein, where substitutions were concentrated at the periphery , even for protein type  <dig> which was the most phylogenetically separated , while retaining the amidase/pgrp activity on both duplicate genes. mammal pgrps are known to form dimmers  <cit>  and in drosophila pgrp-sd interact with gnbp in order to optimally activate the toll pathway  <cit> . amino acid substitutions at non-catalytic sites that might be responsible for prr-prr interactions might favour the maintenance of slightly different proteins that interact optimally with different peptidoglycans. an. gambiae pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> function is not known but transcription profiles of plasmodium falciparum infected mosquitoes were down regulated in midgut and carcasses when compared with mosquitoes that had a blood meal with a p. falciparum strain unable to produce gametocytes  <cit> . however, no differences were observed in both expression profiles  <cit> . once again these results suggest similar function/regulation of these genes.

we cannot determine with certainty when the duplication occurred, but since it is present in both species it is likely that it happened before an. gambiae and an. arabiensis split from a common ancestor. the higher complexity of the haplotype network for pgrp-s <dig>  showing more diversity and a higher proportion of shared haplotypes between species suggests that this may be the ancestral gene from which pgrp-s <dig> may have originated.

the results of selection tests showed that pgrp-s <dig> was the only gene presenting significant departures from neutrality with negative values for tajima's d and fu & li's d and f. negative d values indicate an excess of low frequency mutations consistent with positive selection, however this can be due to effective population size expansion. ka/ks ration for pgrp-s <dig> was also high  but this could be a result of a very small number of diverged sites and per se do not provide a strong evidence of positive selection. for pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig>  both tests presented a non-significant deviation from neutrality. ka/ks ratio showed values much lower than one, reflecting functional constrains on the encoded proteins, i.e., this kind of selection contributes to the elimination of amino acid variation. therefore, these results suggest that the pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> genes are under purifying selection. this does not come as a surprise as accumulating evidence suggests that the majority of anopheles immune related genes, studied so far, are also under purifying selection . since pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> could be recently duplicated genes tests like tajima's d and fu & li's d and f provide limited information  <cit>  and analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions should be more informative. these analyses also point out to purifying selection as the driven force of short pgrps evolution, in the same way as described for other pgrp genes of an. gambiae  <cit>  or drosophila  <cit> .

the different types of selection observed between pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> and s <dig> might be a consequence of their function as pgrp-s <dig> does not have predicted catalityc activity and is probably involved in recognition and subsequent activation of an effector pathway, as pgrp-sa and pgrp-sd in drosophila  <cit> . while pgrp-s <dig> and s <dig> would exert antimicrobial activity like pgrp-sb <dig> in drosophila  <cit>  and/or modulate the response as does drosophila pgrp-sc <dig> and pgrp-sc <dig>  <cit> . further, specificity-determining residues   will determine that distinct classes of peptidoglycans are recognized by different pgrps: pgrp-s <dig> and s <dig> are predicted to bind mpp-dap type peptidoglycans  <cit> . this does not explain why silencing of pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s2/ <dig> protects the mosquito from infection by staphylococcus aureus, that displays lys-type peptidoglycan, but not from infection by escherichia coli   <cit> . pgrp-s <dig> is expressed in response to gut microbiota  <cit> . and microbiota can modulate the response to plasmodium by inducing mosquito basal immunity, which is essential to control the infection. therefore pathogen specificity will indirectly determine the faith of mosquito malaria infection and exert different selection pressure on short pgrp coding genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the three anopheles short pgrp genes studied are involved in the recognition of pathogens. however, they show different evolutionary pathways. pgrp-s <dig> gene is located in the chromosome x while pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> are located in chromosome 2l. this explains why pgrp-s <dig> is less genetically diverse and shows higher divergence between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis regardless of geographic location. on the contrary, pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> are more diverse and less divergent due to autosomal introgression between an. arabiensis and an. gambiae. data indicated that pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> are likely subject to purifying selection consistent with their role in recognising conserved pamps. the 3d model of the proteins showed that no mutations were present at the cleft that forms the peptidoglycan binding groove, once again implying strong evolutionary constrains probably because these proteins need to maintain their pamp recognition site unaltered, while the periphery that interact with other molecules is more prone to accumulate variation. the lower diversity and apparently higher divergence between species for the pgrp-s <dig> gene suggests that this is duplication from pgrp-s <dig>  different types of selection acting on pgrp-s <dig> and pgrp-s <dig> and s <dig> might be a consequence of their different function and catalytic activity.
