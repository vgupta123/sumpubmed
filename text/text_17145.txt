BACKGROUND
deeply divided or fringed petal lobes are known from a range of angiosperm families, including caryophyllaceae, celastraceae, cucurbitaceae, myrtaceae, orchidaceae, saxifragaceae, and tropaeolaceae  <cit> . while the origin and function of subdivided petals vary between groups, division of perianth edges is especially common among nocturnal hawkmoth-pollinated species , where the fringes, in combination with a light petal color, may enhance visibility and thus increase pollination success  <cit> . experiments have shown that diurnal and nocturnal hawkmoths are attracted by floral scent but also rely on visual clues to find and recognize flowers even at extremely low light intensity  <cit> . a preference for high contrasts might help them find their nectar sources, and it seems plausible that fringed petals enhance the sharp contrast between the petal margin and a dark background  <cit> . 

in cucurbitaceae, long-fringed petals are known in five genera that occur in madagascar, tropical africa, the caribbean, and east and southeast asia  <cit> . the largest of them is trichosanthes with currently 90– <dig> species of mainly perennial,  <dig> to  <dig> m long climbers that are usually dioecious and have medium-sized fleshy fruits. referring to the petal fringes, linnaeus formed the genus name from the greek words for 'hair'  and 'flower' . trichosanthes has its center of diversity in southeast asia, but ranges from india throughout tropical and subtropical asia east to japan, and southeast to new guinea, australia, and fiji  <cit> . one species, the snake gourd, t. cucumerina l., is a widely cultivated vegetable in tropical and subtropical regions around the globe, and another  <dig> species are commonly used in asian traditional medicine  <cit> . while floristic treatments are available for most of its range  <cit> , a comprehensive revision of the nearly  <dig> names published in trichosanthes is lacking .

trichosanthes belongs in the tribe sicyoeae, a group of  <dig> genera and c.  <dig> species that is supported by morphological and molecular data  <cit> . based on a limited number of trichosanthes species sequenced, it appeared that the genus might be paraphyletic, with the genera gymnopetalum arn.  and hodgsonia hook.f. & thomson  possibly nested inside it  <cit> . both share with trichosanthes the white flowers, elongated receptacle-tubes, and free filaments. hodgsonia also has long-fringed petals , but differs from trichosanthes and gymnopetalum in its much larger fruits  and unusual seeds. the petal margins in gymnopetalum are entire  or in one species shortly fimbriate  <cit> . geographically, gymnopetalum and hodgsonia largely overlap with the distribution area of trichosanthes except for their absence from new guinea and australia, and from much of the northeastern range of trichosanthes   <cit> . 

based on mainly fruit and seed characters, the  <dig> species of trichosanthes occurring in the flora malesiana region have been grouped into six sections, the typical sect. trichosanthes and sections cucumeroides  kitam., edulis rugayah, foliobracteola c.y.cheng & yueh, involucraria  wight, and asterosperma w.j.de wilde & duyfjes  <cit> . the mainland asian species, t. truncata c.b.clarke, is in its own section, truncata c.y.cheng & c.h.yueh  <cit> . the four species of gymnopetalum have been allocated to two sections that differ in flower morphology, the typical sect. gymnopetalum with just one species from southern india and sri lanka and sect. tripodanthera  cogn. with three southeast asian and malesian species  <cit> .

here we test the monophyly and phylogenetic placement of trichosanthes using a broad sampling of some 60% of its species, including the type species of each section name, plus representatives of gymnopetalum, hodgsonia, and other sicyoeae as well as more distant outgroups. the well-resolved phylogeny, combined with field observations on flower shape and color, allows us to test whether petal fringes in old world sicyoeae evolved just once as would be the case if gymnopetalum and hodgsonia were nested inside it  <cit>  or multiple times as would be implied by these genera having separate evolutionary histories. a combination of molecular-dating and ancestral area reconstruction permits reconstructing the biogeographical history of the trichosanthes clade.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses and taxonomy
phylogenies obtained under bayesian or maximum likelihood  optimization revealed no statistically supported incongruences, defined as nodes with bayesian posterior probabilities  > <dig>  or ml bootstrap support > <dig>  a bayesian consensus tree is shown in figure  <dig>  it reveals that the genus trichosanthes is paraphyletic because gymnopetalum is embedded in it, while gymnopetalum is polyphyletic because its four species do not group together. instead, g. tubiflorum  cogn. groups with species from sections trichosanthes and cucumeroides , while g. orientale w.j.de wilde & duyfjes, g. chinense  merr., and g. scabrum  w.j.de wilde & duyfjes are sister to section edulis . the trichosanthes/gymnopetalum clade  is sister to luffa, a genus of seven or eight species of which we included five. this sister group relationship, however, is only weakly supported . the genus hodgsonia  is only distantly related to the trichosanthes/gymnopetalum clade.

of the seven sections previously proposed in trichosanthes , three are supported by the molecular results, namely sections asterosperma , cucumeroides , and edulis . three other sections with more than one species  are not monophyletic in their current circumscriptions. to achieve a more natural classification, a revised infrageneric classification has been proposed including two new sections  <cit> .

the biogeographic history of the trichosanthes clade
based on a fossil-calibrated bayesian relaxed molecular clock model, trichosanthes originated during the oligocene , an estimate influenced by our prior constraint of the crown node of the trichosanthes/gymnopetalum clade to  <dig> ma. this constraint is based on trichosanthes-like seeds from the upper eocene of bulgaria  <cit>  dating to c.  <dig> ma and seeds from the oligocene of west siberia  <cit>  dating to c.  <dig>  ma  <cit> . seeds assigned to trichosanthes have also been reported from miocene and pliocene sites in france, germany, italy, and poland  <cit> , and pliocene trichosanthes-like leaves are known from france  <cit> . the biogeographic analysis  inferred an east asian origin of the genus , but this inference is based only on the living species, while the just-discussed fossils indicate a more northern  range of trichosanthes before the global climate cooling at the end of the oligocene. many other extinct elements of the european oligocene, miocene, and pliocene floras, such as taxodium, craigia, fagus kraeuselii, ilex, and tropical araceae, such as caladiosoma, also have nearest living relatives in tropical southeast asia  <cit> . 

collision between the eurasian and australian tectonic plates started in the late oligocene, about  <dig> ma ago, and the sahul shelf  and sunda shelf  reached their present proximity only by the late miocene, some  <dig> ma  <cit> . mid-miocene pollen records indicate a warm, moist climate and rainforest expansion on these newly forming islands  <cit> , allowing groups adapted to humid forest conditions, such as the liana clade trichosanthes, to spread and diversify. such plant groups would have benefited from land bridges that during times of sea level changes repeatedly connected new guinea and australia on the one hand, and indochina, sumatra, java, and borneo on the other. the lowest sea levels, during the last glacial maximum , were approximately  <dig> m below those of today, resulting in the complete exposure of the sunda shelf; even sea level reduction by just  <dig> m already connected indochina, sumatra, java, and borneo  <cit> . no land bridges, however, ever connected the islands on the sunda shelf with those in “wallacea,” that is, sulawesi, the moluccas, and the lesser sunda islands, or the latter with new guinea and australia on the sahul shelf. in zoogeography, these two boundaries are known as wallace’s line and lydekker’s line, but their significance as floristic boundaries is doubtful  <cit> .

the most striking transoceanic disjunctions in trichosanthes are numbered in figure  <dig>  they are  the disjunction between the australian species t. subvelutina f.muell. ex cogn. and its sister clade on the asian mainland and areas of the sunda shelf, dated to  <dig>   ma;  the disjunction between t. edulis rugayah, t. dentifera rugayah, t. laeoica c.y.cheng & l.q.huang, t. schlechteri harms from new guinea, and t. odontosperma w.e.cooper & a.j.ford from australia on the one hand, and gymnopetalum chinense, widespread in asia as far east as flores, and g. orientale in sulawesi, the lesser sunda islands, and the moluccas on the other  ma, but the position of g. scabrum relative to g. chinense and g. orientale remains unclear; compare figures  <dig>   <dig>  and 4); and  the disjunction between t. wawrae cogn. from thailand, peninsular malaysia, sumatra, and borneo, and its sister clade t. papuana f.m.bailey/t. pentaphylla f. muell. ex benth. from new guinea and australia, which dates to  <dig>   ma.

trichosanthes range expansion between new guinea and australia occurred during the pliocene/pleistocene, when these two regions were repeatedly connected due to the above-mentioned sea level changes  <cit> . thus, the estimated divergence time of the australian species t. odontosperma  from its new guinean sister species, t. edulis, is  <dig>   ma, while that of the sister species pair t. papuana from the aru islands and new guinea, and t. pentaphylla from australia  is  <dig>   ma; considering their error ranges, these ages fall in the pliocene/pleistocene.

the geographic history of t. pilosa lour. , a widespread species here represented by seven samples from queensland , thailand, vietnam, and japan, cannot be inferred because the within-species relationships lack statistical support . inferring the origin of the snake gourd, t. cucumerina, a vegetable cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the globe  also would require population-level sampling. both species have fleshy red fruits and small seeds, probably dispersed by birds.

evolution and loss of petal fringes
the phylogeny obtained here implies that long-fringed corollas evolved independently in the asian genera hodgsonia and trichosanthes and were lost in three of the four species formerly placed in the genus gymnopetalum . the two inferred losses  coincide with shifts from nocturnal to diurnal flowering times , and it therefore seems likely that there is a shift from predominantly nocturnal sphingid pollinators to diurnal bee or butterfly pollinators. the loss of fringes does not coincide with long-distance dispersal events to insular habitats , and the trigger for the pollinator shifts so far is unknown.

the adaptive function of the corolla fringes in pollinator attraction requires experimental study. an innate preference for radial patterns  <cit>  and high contrasts might help hawkmoths find their nectar sources  <cit> , and one possible explanation for the evolution of fringed petals is that they help create such a radial pattern and sharper contrasts between the petals and a dark background  <cit> . in a diurnal, hawkmoth-pollinated viola species, more complex corolla outlines correlate with higher fruit set  <cit>  but it remains to be tested if this is also the case in the nocturnal trichosanthes-hawkmoth system. another untested possibility is that the fringes with their highly increased surface area and exposed position might be involved in scent production  or produce a waving motion, which has been shown to increase pollinator attraction in other systems  <cit> . anatomical studies of the petal tissue of trichosanthes, wind tunnel experiments with naive hawkmoths, and detailed field observations are required to test these possibilities.

CONCLUSIONS
molecular evidence supports the inclusion of gymnopetalum into a then monophyletic trichosanthes <cit> . our molecular phylogenies reveal that long-fringed petals evolved independently in hodgsonia and trichosanthes/gymnopetalum, followed by two losses of corolla fringes in the latter clade, most likely associated with pollinator shifts. molecular dating and a biogeographic analysis indicate an oligocene initial diversification of trichosanthes in mainland asia. the lineage then diversified and spread in malaysia  during the late miocene and pliocene, reaching the australian continent several times.
