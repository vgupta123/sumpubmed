BACKGROUND
in livestock breeding, sires have an important effect in disseminating superior genetic merit, particularly in situations where artificial insemination  is used  <cit> . sires with better fertility guarantee the efficiency of transmission of the alleles with a superior effect. andrological parameters are also related to the fertility of sires, which is an important selection trait itself. sires with good andrological parameters are important, because beef cattle conception rates have economic impact in the production system  <cit> . improved conception rates increase the economic return. poor semen quality also impacts on the success rates of reproductive biotechnologies  <cit> .

andrological traits, such as scrotal circumference measured at 12 months and percentage of morphologically normal sperm measured at 24 months have a moderate and negative genetic correlation with female puberty  <cit>  and a moderate and positive genetic correlation with female stayability in the herd  <cit> . in other words, the selection for higher scrotal circumference and/or higher percentage of normal sperm in young bulls, should lead to female progeny that will be sexually precocious and have a higher probability to stay in the herd. female fertility traits are of high relevance for beef cattle production in tropical areas. these traits could be from four to thirteen times more important, economically speaking, than carcass and growth traits  <cit> . due to cost, andrological traits other than scrotal circumference, are not commonly measured and evaluated in animal breeding programs  <cit> . the identification of genetic markers associated with the traits could assist in animal breeding, via genomic selection.

using a gwas methodology, qtl regions were identified on the bovine x chromosome that potentially influence andrological traits in cattle  <cit> . the aim of this study was to fine-map the qtl regions, focussing on candidate genes to identify possible causative mutations. in future, these variants may be used to construct a low density chip for improved genetic evaluation with a better cost-benefit  <cit> . further, customized chips with causative mutations are likely to have a higher transferability among breeds because predictions derived from them do not depend on linkage disequilibrium between the marker assayed and the causal mutation. a gwas study confirmed that variants in coding regions explain more of the trait variation than random snps, exemplifying the important role of missense mutations in genomic evaluation  <cit> .

candidate genes in the x chromosome qtl regions were chosen according to their biological role. they are: loc <dig>  cenpi, taf7l, nxf <dig>  cylc <dig>  tex <dig>  ar, uxt and spaca <dig>  the gene loc <dig> is a homolog of the tcp <dig> gene and plays an important role in spermatogenesis and sperm function in humans  <cit> ; cenpi participates in gonadal development and gametogenesis in rats  <cit> ; taf7l could be spermatogenesis-specific and is related to human male infertility  <cit> ; nxf <dig>  is an mrna transporter and its inactivation causes bull infertility  <cit> ; cylc <dig> is a protein of the spermatozoa head with a cytoskeleton function in cattle and humans  <cit> ; uxt protein participates in the ar transcription regulation in human prostate cells  <cit>  and spaca <dig> codes for protein in the sperm acrosome with lysozyme activity . the first four genes are in the qtl associated with percentage of morphologically of normal sperm  and the others in the qtl associated with scrotal circumference   <cit> .

snps in tex <dig> and ar genes were found to be associated with semen and testis traits in cattle  <cit> . in this study, the aim was to validate these polymorphisms in another population, so their effect might be confirmed. this validation exercise was extended to include two more candidate genes, not related to the above mentioned qtl: plag <dig> and tekt <dig>  the plag <dig> mutation on bta <dig> has a pleiotropic effect in many economically important traits in cattle and other species  <cit>  and tekt <dig> is a gene associated with spermatozoa motility from a proteomic study in brahman cattle  <cit> .

a total of eleven genes were chosen as candidates for andrological traits in cattle. the aim was to locate potential causative mutations, defined as non-synonymous snps and snps or indels in coding and splicing regions, and to verify their association with scrotal circumference  and percentage of normal sperm  traits in beef bulls. further, the association of the candidate snps with female fertility traits and male growth traits were tested for evaluation of pleiotropic effects.

RESULTS
snp discovery and genotyping
based on the  <dig> bull genomes available, files with snps and indels were generated for the target regions. the variants were selected according to their locations . for each of seven genes in the sc and pns qtl regions in chromosome x and for tekt <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  one non-synonymous snp per gene was selected to be genotyped in the entire population. for tex <dig> two snps were tested.

details about these genes and selected snps, such as position and identification number, variation, position in the coding region  and in the protein and the amino acid change can be found in table  <dig>  the usual hypothesis applies: changes in the amino acid composition may change protein activity and affect the associated phenotype.table  <dig>

using taqman assays,  <dig>  male cattle were genotyped for twelve snps: eight snps in the genes described above and four snp studied in other populations previously. the four snps studied before were on the genes tex <dig> , ar  and plag <dig>   <cit> .

the allelic and genotypic frequencies for all these snps are described in table  <dig> and  <dig>  all of them presented a good distribution to be used for association analyses. as expected, for the snps located in the x chromosome, heterozygotes were not identified in males.table  <dig>

analysis of linkage disequilibrium
the linkage disequilibrium  was estimated and an arbitrary r <dig> value of  <dig>  was considered to indicate that snps were in strong linkage disequilibrium. for the bulls , the r <dig> estimates ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  however, only two pairs of snps had a high estimate of r <dig>  the snps tex11_r38k and tex11_r696h were completely linked . this means that all animals had the same genotypes for both snps and it was impossible to differentiate their effects. for the association analyses, the snp tex11_r38k was therefore used to represent both. the snps located in loc <dig> and taf7l genes also had a high ld ; all the other pairs estimates were lower than  <dig> . the effect of these snps could therefore be analysed separately.

for the cows , similar results were obtained. the snps tex11_r38k and tex11_r696h have a high r <dig> value . snps located in loc <dig> and taf7l genes also had a higher ld ; all the other pairs estimates were lower than  <dig> .

usually, the ld of chromosome x is higher in comparison to the ld of the autosomes  <cit> ; however, the r <dig> values obtained here  for most of the snps may be explained in terms of population characteristics. the study population consisted of animals of a composite breed and crossbreeds, forming a population where a higher level of recombination will be expected.

association analyses
the substitution allelic effect for the named allele of each snp, standard errors, p-values and the percentage of the additive genetic variance explained were estimated for each studied trait: percentage of normal sperm at 24 months , scrotal circumference at  <dig> , at 18 months  and at 24 months  . significant snps reported here for sc at three ages and for pns  serve to confirm previously described qtl regions  <cit> . the results show that gwas research is a very strong tool to find candidate genes. further, combining the gwas information with the available genome sequences yield putative causative mutations  associated with sc and pns.table  <dig>

significance , allelic substitution effect  for the named allele of each snp, its standard error  and the percentage of additive genetic variance  explained by the genotypes of each snp on production of normal sperm at 24 months , scrotal circumference at 12 months , at 18 months  and at 24 months of age . significantly associated < <dig>  are highlighted in bold. the p-values are uncorrected.



the most significant snps associated with pns  explained from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the additive genetic variance in the bull population. the percentage of additive genetic variance explained by the most significant snp  for sc traits varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, in this population. it is worth noticing the effects of snps in ar and tex <dig> genes for all sc traits and the ones in loc <dig> and taf7l for sc <dig> . these percentages of explained genetic variance are considered high for individual mutations. for example, known causative mutations such as those in the calpain and calpastatin genes associated with meat quality explain up to 2% of the phenotypic variance  <cit> . the very high percentage of additive genetic variance explained by some markers could be explained by the fact that the ld estimates for the x chromosome are higher in comparison to the autosomes. the lower occurrence of cross-overs means that larger dna fragments are inherited. the snp associations we observed may therefore report the combined effects of more than one marker. an example of this is the complete linkage of the two snps in the tex <dig> gene in the bull population and the inability to differentiate their effects.

the genes loc <dig>  taf7l, cenpi and nxf <dig> were located in the pns qtl, but they also influence sc traits, indicating a pleiotropic effect for these andrological traits. for these genes and three more  this study provides the first evidence of an association with male fertility traits in livestock. polymorphisms in taf7l, nxf <dig> and loc <dig> have been associated with male fertility traits in humans and mice, indicating that these genes have conserved roles among mammals  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> , respectively. for cylc <dig>  uxt, spaca <dig> and cenpi, this is the first snp association study to provide evidence of their influence in male mammal fertility traits.

the snps located in ar and tex <dig> have been studied before, and their influence on scrotal circumference traits in brahman and tropical composite bulls has been documented  <cit> . the similar results obtained, in the present study, validate these findings. the snp in the ar gene is located in intron  <dig> and it is in linkage disequilibrium with important variants located in the promoter region of the gene in cattle. these variants are responsible for the creation/absence of binding sites for sry gene, the gene that initiates sex differentiation in mammals  <cit> . for tex <dig>  the gene with a snp that has a large effect on the analysed traits, there is some information based on humans and mouse studies. it is known that this gene acts in gonad development  <cit> , as a meiosis-specific factor  <cit>  and its loss of function eliminates the spermatocytes. defects in this gene may cause chromosomal asynapsis and reduction in crossover formation  <cit> . it has been also shown that it acts in male fertility by competing with estrogen receptor  for a specific binding site in the hpip protein  <cit> . the non-synonymous snps described here changes the amino acid  <dig> and  <dig> and the region of tex <dig> protein that binds hpip protein is from aminoacids  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that the snp tex11_r696h may be the best candidate mutation, since it changes an important protein site.

the significant effect  of the snp in plag <dig> for sc <dig> indicates that this gene also influences scrotal circumference measurements in cattle. this snp has a pleiotropic effect on a number of growth traits  <cit>  and it was associated with age at 26 cm of sc in cattle  <cit> . the absence of association of tekt <dig> gene  suggests that there are post-transcriptional changes that might be responsible for affecting the phenotype not related to genotypic variation.

the strong associations seen here confirm that genes located on the x chromosome affect male fertility traits and snps in this chromosome should be incorporated in the genetic analysis in order to have better evaluations and genomic values predictions. a recent study validated the importance of coding snp variants and confirmed that missense snps mapped explain the greatest variant for many traits in cattle  <cit> . the fine-mapping conducted here also highlights the importance to work with putative causative mutation and the benefits that it might bring to the animal breeding and genetics.

the single marker regressions with the top markers fixed are shown in table  <dig>  the results for pns and sc traits at different ages indicate that the effects of the top markers are independent in the population. the fixation of the top marker for each trait still allows the significance of other snps to be detected. in addition to the ld results shown above, these results indicate that snps are segregating separately and that they independently contribute to the traits.table  <dig>

significance , allelic substitution effect  and its standard error  of each snp on production of normal sperm at 24 months , scrotal circumference at 12 months , at 18 months  and at 24 months of age .



the significant snps found for these andrological traits are good candidates to be included in customized low density chips for cattle evaluation  <cit> . further gwas and causative mutations studies in the autosomes might be done in the future in order to identify more informative variants for these traits.

these snps were also analysed for growth traits in the same males . almost all the snps were associated with birth weight and some were also associated with weaning and yearling weights, mainly the snp in plag <dig> and tex <dig> genes  . it indicates the selection of the avourable alleles for andrological traits may also select for heavier animals. this result is not surprising given the known genetic correlation between weight and sc  <cit> . the association of the snp in plag <dig> with growth traits confirm previous results reported  <cit> .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
the qtl on chromosome x associated with bull fertility have been confirmed in an independent population. putative causative mutations in the x chromosome influence the production of normal sperm and scrotal circumference of young bulls in zebu cattle and their crossbreds. they are good candidate snps to be incorporated in low-density chips that could facilitate genetic evaluation. moreover, the information provided on key genes may serve as basis for further functional experiments. pleiotropic effects across andrological and growth traits were reported; nevertheless these mutations had no impact on female fertility traits.
