BACKGROUND
corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causative agent of diphtheria, a toxaemic localized infection of the respiratory tract. while this disease is well-controlled by vaccination against the diphtheria toxin in e. g. western europe  <cit> , it is still a severe health problem in less developed countries. furthermore, c. diphtheriae is not only the aetiological agent of diphtheria, but can cause other infections as well. non-toxigenic strains have been increasingly documented  <cit>  and found to be the cause of invasive diseases such as endocarditis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, spleen abscesses, and septic arthritis  <cit> . as indicated by these systemic infections, c. diphtheriae is not only able to attach to host epithelial cells of larynx and pharynx, but must be able to gain access to deeper tissues and to persist inside tissues or cells.

a possible clue for the background of persistence of c. diphtheriae came from investigations of adherence and invasion of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains by different groups. using a combination of gentamicin protection assays and thin-section electron microscopy, hirata and co-workers  <cit>  showed that toxigenic c. diphtheriae are not only able to adhere to laryngeal hep- <dig> cells, but also enter these cells and survive after internalization. similar observations were made for non-toxigenic strains  <cit>  showing that also pharyngeal detroit  <dig> cells can be invaded by c. diphtheriae and that viable intracellular bacteria can be detected up to  <dig> h after infection.

while host cell receptors and invasion-associated proteins of the pathogen are still unknown, bacterial adhesion factors have been recently at least partially characterized on the molecular level. c. diphtheriae strain nctc <dig> is able to assemble three distinct types of pili on its surface  <cit> . mutant analyses showed that the spaa-type pilus is sufficient for adhesion of this strain to pharynx cells, shaft proteins are not crucial for pathogen-host interaction, and adherence to pharyngeal cells is greatly diminished when minor pili proteins spab and spac are lacking  <cit> . the results obtained in other studies indicated the existence of additional proteins besides pili subunits involved in adhesion to larynx, pharynx, and lung epithelial cells, since a total loss of attachment to pharyngeal cells due to mutagenesis of pili- and sortase-encoding genes could not be observed and attachment to lung or larynx cells was less affected by the mutations. this is in line with a number of studies suggesting the multifactorial mechanism of adhesion . furthermore, hirata and co-workers  <cit>  described three distinct patterns of adherence to hep- <dig> cells, an aggregative, a localized, and a diffuse form, an observation that hints also to the existence of several adhesion factors and different receptors on the host cell surface. the involvement of different c. diphtheriae proteins to adherence to distinct cell types is further supported by work on adhesion to human erythrocytes, showing that non-fimbrial surface proteins 67p and 72p, which were up to now only characterized by their apparent mass, are involved in this process  <cit> . interestingly, besides strain-specific differences in adherences , also growth-dependent effects were observed. in a study using two toxigenic c. diphtheriae strains and erythrocytes as well as hep- <dig> cells, de oliveira moreira and co-workers  <cit>  showed an effect of iron supply on hemagglutination and lectin binding properties of the microorganisms.

in this study, we present a characterization of different non-toxigenic c. diphtheriae and a toxin-producing strain with respect to adhesion to and internalization into epithelial cells. analyses reveal significant strain-specific differences in host colonization and macromolecular surface structures of the studied strains, while neither of the strains evoked rapid cell damage under the conditions tested.

RESULTS
adhesion of c. diphtheriae to epithelial cells, invasion of host cells and intracellular survival
in this study, adhesion of six non-toxigenic strains and one toxin-producing c. diphtheriae to detroit <dig> cells was analyzed . in these experiments tox+ strain dsm <dig> showed the lowest adhesion rate with  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. while in general higher than the tox+ strain, the non-toxigenic strains differed significantly in their adhesion rate, varying between  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for strain dsm <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for strain iss <dig> .

once attached to the surface of an epithelial cell, c. diphtheriae might invade the host cell and persist within the cell. in order to investigate this process for the different strains studied here, gentamicin protection assays were carried out. for this purpose, cells were incubated for  <dig>  h with bacteria, gentamicin was added to kill remaining extracellular c. diphtheriae and survival of intracellular bacteria was analyzed after different times of incubation . when invasion into d <dig> cells was analyzed for the six non-toxigenic strains and the toxigenic c. diphtheriae strain after  <dig> h, tox+ strain dsm <dig> showed the lowest internalization rate with  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. as in the adhesion assay, the non-toxigenic strains showed in general a higher rate compared to the toxin-producer strain and again rates differed significantly between the non-toxigenic strains, varying between  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for strain iss <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for strain iss <dig> . the comparison of strains in respect to adhesion and internalization rates suggested that although a high adhesion seems to favour internalization, adhesion and invasion are not strictly coupled processes. plating and counting of internalized cells after  <dig>  and  <dig>  h revealed decreasing numbers of colony forming units . even after  <dig>  h, no strain was completely eliminated from the cells and survival of bacteria ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the inoculums for dsm <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for iss <dig> 

in addition to the gentamicin protection assay, which gives quantitative data, immune-fluorescence microscopy was applied as an independent method to investigate host cell interaction of c. diphtheriae strains. this method has the advantage of allowing direct visualization, although only on a qualitative level. using an antiserum directed against c. diphtheriae surface proteins and antibody staining before and after permeabilization of the host cell, internalized c. diphtheriae were detected . interestingly, v-shaped c. diphtheriae dimers within the cells were observed. these v-forms are the result of the corynebacterium-specific snapping division and indicate growing bacteria. together with a tendency towards formation of clusters of cells , this observation suggests that bacteria replicate within the host cells and growth and elimination described above  are parallel processes.

influence of c. diphtheriae on the transepithelial resistance of cell monolayers
some pathogens, such as salmonella enteric serovar typhimurium , can cause severe damage on cell membranes and due to the resulting loss of cell integrity, the transepithelial resistance of monolayers is dramatically reduced . in this study, we used s. typhimurium nctc <dig> as a positive control  and tested the influence of different c. diphtheriae strains on transepithelial resistance . infection of detroit <dig> monolayers with s. typhimurium caused a dramatic break-down of transepithelial resistance within  <dig>  h while all tested c. diphtheriae strains including tox+ strain dsm <dig> had no effect on transepithelial resistance within a time span of three hours. since the incubation conditions used in this assay are similar to that applied for the adhesion and invasion assays, this observation indicates that a detrimental effect of toxin production can be excluded as a reason for the low adhesion and internalization rates of strain dsm <dig> 

overnight incubation of d <dig> cells with c. diphtheriae was tested as well. in this case, the dulbecco's modified eagle's medium had to be exchanged after  <dig> h with fresh medium to remove not adhered bacteria in order to avoid that the ph of the medium dropped due to the bacterial metabolism leading to secondary detrimental effects. in contrast to short term incubation and to the non-toxigenic strains, long term measurement  of transepithelial resistance of cell monolayers infected with dsm <dig> showed a significant effect, which might be caused by toxin production.

ultrastructural analysis of c. diphtheriae strains
since we suspected that the differences in adhesion might be the result of different surface structures, we started an ultrastructure analysis of selected c. diphtheriae. for this purpose, non-toxigenic strains as well as tox+ strain dsm <dig> were analyzed by atomic force microscopy . with this technique, which allows imaging surfaces topography at high resolution, significant different macromolecular surface structures were found between the different investigated c. diphtheriae strains. while for iss <dig> and dsm <dig> pili were not detectable at all, iss <dig> and dsm <dig> revealed short, spike-like pili, iss <dig>  iss <dig> and dsm <dig> showed long, hair-like protrusions . also the number of pili  differed significantly . interestingly, adhesion and pili formation were not coupled, since iss <dig>  which revealed spike-like pile and iss <dig>  lacking these, showed comparable adhesion rates, while iss <dig> and iss <dig> had different numbers of long hair-like pili but showed identical adhesion rates. also no correlation between invasion and pili formation was found. since strain-specific differences in pili formation have not been observed before, the background for this phenomenon was investigated in more detail in subsequent experiments.

strain-specific expression of pili subunits
to analyze the molecular basis of strain-specific differences in pili formation, rna hybridization experiments were carried out to study the mrna levels of the c. diphtheriae spa genes. these genes are organized in three different clusters together with the corresponding sortase-encoding genes in the sequenced strain nctc <dig>  <cit> . the first cluster comprises the genes spaa, spab, and spac, which are most likely organized as an operon; the second cluster is formed by spad and a putative spae-spaf operon, and a third cluster comprises the spag, spah, and spai gene, which are most likely independently transcribed. strain-specific differences were detected, when probes for the detection of all genes of cluster i and iii were applied in rna hybridization experiments .

strongest hybridization signals with spaa, spab, and spac probes were detected with rna isolated from strains iss <dig> and iss <dig>  slightly lower signal intensities were observed with strain dsm <dig>  while only faint signals were obtained for cluster i mrna for the other investigated strains. strong transcription of spag, spah, and spai were again detected in strains iss <dig> and iss <dig>  while other strains did not express cluster iii genes deduced from rna hybridization experiments. the data are in accordance with the afm experiments presented in fig.  <dig>  which show formation of a high number of extended pili for strains iss <dig> and iss <dig>  followed by dsm43989; however, hybridization signals may differ not only due to mrna abundance, but also due to sequence alteration.

to elucidate whether the missing transcripts in various strains are the result of regulatory processes or have genetic reasons, pcr experiments were carried out, which showed that missing transcripts are correlated to lacking pcr products making regulatory effects unlikely . furthermore, reproducible strain-specific differences in sizes of the pcr products were observed for spaa and in band intensities for spab fragments, suggesting that also sequence deviations exist besides strain-specific differences in the spa gene repertoire. interestingly, we were unable to generate any probes for genes of cluster ii, comprising spad, spae, and spaf, when chromosomal dna of the used iss and dsm strains were used as template, while all genes could be amplified from nctc <dig> dna . deduced from these pcr experiments, these genes seem to be absent in the investigated c. diphtheriae strains. as an additional approach, we tested expression of spad in the different strains by western blot experiments. cell extracts of strains iss <dig>  iss <dig>  iss <dig>  iss <dig>  dsm <dig>  dsm <dig>  and dsm <dig> as well as purified spad protein as a positive control were separated by sds-page and subjected to western blotting. spad-specific antiserum reacted exclusively with the spad control, while no signal was detectable in the investigated cell extracts .

to address the hypothesis that pili expression patterns might change, when bacteria were in exposed to host cells, green fluorescent protein  fluorescence of c. diphtheriae transformed with plasmids carrying spa gene upstream dna and a promoter-less gfpuv gene was determined without and after  <dig>  h of host cell contact. however, analysis of  <dig> to  <dig> bacteria for gfp fluorescence before and after host cell contact revealed no significant differences .

discussion
in this study, different non-toxigenic c. diphtheriae and a toxin-producing strain were characterized in respect to adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells. all strains were able to attach to host cells and immuno-fluorescence microscopy revealed internalization and growth of c. diphtheriae within epithelial cells. we could show that adhesion and invasion are not strictly coupled, indicating that different proteins and mechanisms play a role in these processes. despite the fact that the number of internalized bacteria decreased over time for all investigated strains, a considerable number of bacteria survived prolonged internalization for more than  <dig> h. furthermore, v-shaped division forms as well as formation of microcolonies were observed by fluorescence microscopy, suggesting that the epithelial cells might support growth of c. diphtheriae.

while proteins responsible for invasion and intracellular persistence are completely unknown for c. diphtheriae, for the sequenced strain nctc <dig> the influence of pili subunits on adhesion was characterized recently. it was shown that the minor pili subunits spab and spac are crucial for adhesion of strain nctc <dig> to epithelial cells  <cit> , while pili length is influenced by the major pili subunits spaa, spad, and spah, which form the shaft of the structure  <cit> . the strains investigated here showed significant variations in adhesion rates and compared to the tox+ strain, for all studied non-toxigenic strains higher adhesion rates were observed; however, adhesion and pili formation were not strictly coupled processes. strain-specific differences of appearance and numbers of pili-like structures on the surface of c. diphtheriae strains were shown by ultrastructural analyses via atomic force microscopy. additionally, rna hybridization and western blotting experiments revealed distinct differences in the expression patterns of pili subunits for the investigated strains. to our knowledge, this is the first time that isolate-specific differences in pili formation were characterized. mandlik and co-workers  <cit>  showed that type iii pili length of strain nctc <dig> depends on spah expression and can be manipulated by deletion or overexpression of spah. these results are supplemented here by showing that this is a phenomenon which occurs also as natural variation in different c. diphtheriae wild type isolates. strains iss <dig> and iss <dig> showed the most extended pili structures, an observation which is correlated with high expression of spaa and spah in these strains, while medium-length pili of dsm <dig> are correlated with lack of spah expression. as mentioned above, it was shown by mutant analyses of strain nctc <dig> that expression of spab and spac is crucial for adhesion to d <dig> cells  <cit> . natural variations of the spab and spac expression patterns observed here indicate that this correlation is not as strict as suggested, since strain iss <dig> shows only low spab and no spac expression but a high adhesion rate, indicating that other factors are important for adhesion as well and expression of these might differ in various isolates.

the lack of any pcr product for spad, spae, and spaf and the absence of a spad signal in western blotting experiments suggest that these genes are absent in the investigated strains. all pili-encoding genes of c. diphtheriae are located on pathogenicity islands  <cit> . based on the genome sequence of strain nctc <dig>  c. diphtheriae possesses  <dig> of these genomic islands  <cit>  and pili cluster ii is located on genomic island cdgi- <dig>  which has a size of  <dig>  kb and is located directly adjacent to  <dig>  kb pathogenicity island cdgi- <dig>  the tox+ corynephage  <cit> . data of pcr experiments  indicate that the pili-encoding genes located on cdgi- <dig> are missing in all investigated iss and dsm strains and consequently the genetic repertoire of c. diphtheriae isolates is rather variable. this observation is in agreement with a recent genome survey of c. diphtheriae c <dig> and pw <dig> strains  <cit>  indicating that  <dig> of the  <dig> putative pathogenicity islands of the sequenced reference strain nctc <dig> are absent in the c <dig> strain.

the importance of bacterial appendices and surface proteins for host cell contact were also shown recently for a non-fimbrial protein, dip <dig>  previously annotated as invasion-associated protein. this protein is a virulence factor involved in cell surface organization, adhesion and internalization in epithelial cells. corresponding mutant strains lack the ability to adhere to host cells or invade these  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this study show that adhesion and invasion are not necessarily coupled processes. adhesion rates are not strictly correlated with pili formation and in summary the pili repertoire of the investigated strains is highly variable. as shown by genome comparisons  <cit>  it is necessary to investigate various isolates on a molecular level to understand and to predict the colonization process of different c. diphtheriae strains.
