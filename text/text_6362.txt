BACKGROUND
numerous species of cloven-hoofed wildlife and livestock, including buffalo, impala, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs are affected by foot-and-mouth disease   <cit> . the disease is clinically characterised by fever, lameness and vesicular lesions on the tongue, feet, snout/muzzle and teats of various susceptible species  <cit> . globally, the disease causing agent, fmd virus , exists in seven different serotypes  and vaccination against  one serotype does not cross-protect against other serotypes, hence the need for constant surveillance of circulating strains for appropriate vaccine selection  <cit> .

in the eastern africa region, including kenya, four of the seven serotypes  were previously known to circulate  <cit> , but recently in  <dig>  sat  <dig> was isolated from an apparently healthy long-horned ankole calf in uganda  <cit> . this multiplicity of serotypes, combined with the co-existence of a number of different wild and domestic hosts within large geographical areas, makes our understanding of the epidemiology and control of this disease complicated  <cit> . in eastern africa, existing policies largely comprise vaccination and livestock movement control. infection by the virus may result in substantial economic losses; these include production losses  as well as effects from restrictions on sales and exports of livestock and livestock products  <cit> .

the severity of fmd varies from host to host, e.g. cattle commonly suffer acute, clinically apparant infections  <cit> , while in the african buffalo  the disease is usually subclinical  <cit>  and hence is not easy to detect. it has been reported that within wildlife, the african buffalo are reservoirs for the sat serotypes  <cit>  and may play a role in the maintenance and spread of these serotypes to livestock  <cit>  as reported in southern africa. moreover, this buffalo species is capable of harbouring the virus for as long as 5 years within an individual animal and for 24 years within a single herd  <cit> . animals with these long-term infections are referred to as persistently infected animals or carriers, and are defined as animals in which the virus can be detected from the oesophago-pharyngeal scrapings  at 28 days or more after infection  <cit> . unlike in southern africa, the role of the african buffalo in the epidemiology of fmd is still unclear in eastern africa  <cit> , yet buffalo interact with livestock, grazing together in the vast and numerous un-fenced wildlife ecosystems.

it has been argued that wildlife might act as a source of sporadic disease occurrence in livestock with negative impacts on the harmonious co-existence of these species  <cit> . on the one hand, there is experimental evidence that fmd may spread from buffalo to cattle, while on the other hand, there is a lack of adequate supportive scientific evidence for the role of wildlife in the epidemiology of fmd in livestock  <cit> . indeed, some studies have argued that fmd may be predominantly a disease of livestock  <cit>  and that the spread of fmdv among livestock may be more associated with human activities than with wildlife  <cit> . moreover, the importance of enhancing our understanding of disease spread at the wildlife-livestock interface and the need to balance biodiversity management with livestock production have been emphasized previously  <cit> . it is therefore necessary to study the disease spread at this interface to ensure that appropriate policies and control measures are implemented. this should help to protect the wildlife heritage and concurrently promote harmonious, profitable and sustainable livestock-wildlife interaction.

according to unpublished kenya wildlife service  records, kenya has an estimated total population of  <dig>  buffalo distributed among numerous parks, reserves, sanctuaries and ranches found within several major ecosystems including tsavo, meru, laikipia/samburu, amboseli, nakuru and maasai-mara. this buffalo population and other less susceptible wildlife species complements the numerous domestic fmdv-susceptible hosts in kenya, including  <dig>  million cattle,  <dig>  million goats,  <dig>  million sheep and  <dig>  domestic pigs recorded during the  <dig> national animal census  <cit> . records at the national foot-and-mouth disease laboratory , embakasi, show that previous studies on fmd in kenya have been mainly focused on cattle and not other susceptible domestic species such as pigs  <cit>  and only to a minor extent on wildlife. however, in  <dig>  a field survey isolated sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> fmdvs from buffalo populations in the southern part of kenya  <cit> , while a more recent study  established a higher seroprevalence of antibodies against fmdv in buffalo than in other susceptible wildlife species, but also highlighted some limitations of the specificity of the serological tests that were used  <cit> .

elsewhere in the east african region, studies of buffalo within neighbouring uganda’s queen elizabeth national park isolated sat  <dig> virus in  <dig>  <cit> , reported antibodies against fmdv serotypes o, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> in sera collected during 2001- <dig>  <cit> , and successfully isolated and genetically characterized sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> viruses in 2005- <dig>  <cit> .

this study, aimed at determining the presence of antibodies against different serotypes of fmdv within buffalo populations in selected wildlife ecosystems in kenya and at comparing fmdv isolates from these buffalo populations with the fmdvs found in cattle within this country and elsewhere in africa. the study endevoured to contribute towards generating reliable information regarding fmdv circulation in eastern africa.

ethical approval
this study was ethically approved by the kenya wildlife services  and undertaken in collaboration with the department of veterinary services  of the ministry of livestock development in kenya under the transboundary animal diseases in east africa  project, dfc no. 10-006ku.

samples from buffalo
the buffalo sampling was carried out between march and july  <dig>  the study was designed as a cross-sectional study targeting buffalo populations interacting with domestic animals regardless of their age. the buffalo were clustered into three major buffalo ecosystems located within four out of the eight major administrative regions/provinces of kenya  . these include the meru ecosystem , represented by meru national park, the maasai-mara ecosystem , represented by maasai-mara national reserve and the tsavo ecosystem , represented by tsavo east national park. these ecosystems have estimated populations of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> buffalo, respectively, according to the kws records. within these ecosystems, there is a high level of interaction between livestock and wildlife. mme and tse have open savannah-type vegetation, which eases the capture and handling of the animals, while me has patches of wooded grassland vegetation.figure  <dig>

two groups of veterinarians and technicians in two separate vehicles carried out the buffalo sampling; one identified the herds and chemically immobilized the animals as described by  <cit> , while the other traced, marked and sampled the immobilized animals, taking records of geographical location, age by dentition  <cit> , sex, clinical signs, body condition and estimated herd size. two or three animals per herd were randomly selected to enable sampling of as many herds as possible.

in total  <dig> serum and corresponding probang samples were collected from buffalo; these comprised samples from mme , tse  and me  with approximate animal ages ranging between 8 months and 19 years. the probang samples were diluted 1: <dig> in phosphate buffered saline   supplemented with  <dig> % bovine serum albumin ,  <dig> % phenol red and  <dig> % antibiotics , stored in liquid nitrogen and transported to fmdl, embakasi, where they were stored at −80°c.

testing strategy
this study compared evidence of infection by fmdv in buffalo and cattle using serological and virological assays as recommended by the oie terrestrial manual  <cit> . all serological tests  were performed at fmdl, embakasi, while all tests on epithelia from cattle and probang samples from buffalo, including sequencing were performed at the national veterinary institute, lindholm, denmark.

buffalo sera were screened for antibodies against fmdv non-structural proteins  as an indicator of prior infection with fmdv. serotype-specific antibody titres were initially determined using liquid phase blocking elisas  . thereafter , vnts, which exhibit lower level of cross-reactivity  <cit> , were performed for neutralizing antibodies against six serotypes of fmdv .

all buffalo probang samples were tested using the 3d coding region-targeted real time rt-pcr  assay and virus isolation  was attempted. harvests of samples that induced cytopathic effect  in primary bovine thyroid  cells were tested in antigen elisa  and in 5’utr-targeted real time rt-pcr . harvests positive in ag-elisa and with sufficient fmdv rna to generate an amplicon corresponding to the vp <dig> coding sequence were characterized by sequencing. cattle epithelia were tested directly in the ag-elisa and using the 5’utr rt-qpcr assay and when amplicons could be generated directly were sequenced.

laboratory methods
detection of antibodies against fmdv non-structural proteins  in buffalo sera
all  <dig> buffalo sera were screened using the priocheck® fmdv ns kit  to detect antibodies against the nsps of fmdv. the assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sera were tested using a 1: <dig> dilution and optical density  measured at wavelength 450 nm . the results were expressed as percentage inhibition  relative to the negative control  as follows: pi =  <dig> −  ×  <dig>  sera with pi < <dig> were considered negative and sera with pi ≥50% positive.

assay for antibodies against fmdv using serotype-specific liquid phase blocking elisa  in buffalo sera
the lpbe assay was performed on all  <dig> buffalo serum samples using a commercial kit , in accordance with the oie manual  <cit> . the antigens used for this assay were: o <dig> manisa, a <dig> irq 24/ <dig>  c phi 7/ <dig>  sat  <dig> , sat  <dig> eritrea, sat  <dig> , and asia  <dig> shamir as contained in the kit. the sera were tested in two-fold dilution series from 1/ <dig> to 1/ <dig>  the results were expressed as the reciprocal of the last positive dilution ; samples with titres ≥ <dig> were considered positive in accordance with instructions in the oie manual.

assay for neutralising antibodies against fmdv in buffalo sera
vnts were performed to detect neutralizing antibodies against six serotypes  on all the  <dig> buffalo sera to confirm the lpbe results and to clarify possible cross-reactions as described in the oie manual  <cit> . briefly, quadruplicate two-fold dilution series of serum samples were incubated for 1 hr in flat-bottomed tissue culture grade microtitre plates with about  <dig> tcid <dig> of each of the kenyan fmdv vaccine strains  and a zimbabwean sat  <dig> isolate . the use of these old isolates was based on previous experience  <cit>  and their satisfactory performance during the annual world reference laboratory  proficiency tests. subsequently, a suspension of baby hamster kidney  cells was added to the samples followed by incubation for 2 days at 37°c. for sat  <dig>  incubation was in primary swine kidney  cells for 3 days at 37°c. the controls included titration of a standard positive serum, cell control and a ten-fold titration of the virus suspension. the final end point titres were calculated as described previously  <cit>  and titres ≥ <dig> were considered positive, 16- <dig> doubtful and < <dig> negative  <cit> .

serological data recording and statistical analysis
serological results were recorded and descriptive statistics calculated in ms excel  <dig> . analyses of estimated prevalences and confidence intervals were performed using the survey toolbox software  <cit> .

epithelial and probang sample processing and virus isolation 
all epithelia and probang samples were thawed at room temperature and processed as recommended in the oie manual  <cit> . epithelial samples from cattle were ground in eagles minimum essential media supplemented with protein hydrolysate, 2% fetal calf serum and antibiotics  using sterile sand, mortar and pestle to make a 10%  suspension. these lysates were tested directly in the ag-elisa and used for rna extraction, rt-qpcr and sequencing . probang suspensions from buffalo were inoculated onto bty cells for 1 hour at 37°c followed by a change of media and continued incubation. the cultures were examined after  <dig> and 48 hours and harvested when cpe developed. the cpe negative samples were harvested by freeze-thawing and inoculated onto fresh cells for another 48 hours. cpe positive samples were harvested, while cultures negative after  <dig> passages were discarded. positive harvests were tested in the ag-elisa and tested in the 5’utr rt-qpcr assay .

detection of fmdv rna using quantitative real time rt-pcr 
quantitative rt-qpcr assays targeting the fmdv 3d coding sequence of the fmdv rna were performed on buffalo probang samples as described previously  <cit>  using a superscript iii/platinum taq one-step rt-qpcr kit  with 3d probe , forward primer  and reverse primer . in addition, rt-qpcr assays targeting the fmdv 5’ utr were performed on all the  <dig> cattle epithelia and cpe positive buffalo harvests using taqman® universal 2x pcr master mix . the pcr was run, as described previously  <cit> , using the fmdv multiii ires primers  and fmdv multi ii- <dig> probe .

antigen detection elisa 
ag-elisa to detect the presence of fmdv was performed as described in the oie manual  <cit>  and by  <cit> , and, when positive, to determine the serotype. samples with an od difference between sample and negative control of > <dig>  were considered positive, while those between  <dig>  and  <dig>  were considered inconclusive and repeated.

sequencing of the fmdv vp <dig> coding region
viral rna was extracted from ag-elisa positive harvests of cell culture generated using buffalo probang samples and cattle epithelia samples. this was achieved by using the qiamp® rna blood mini kit  following the protocol for extraction of total rna as described by the manufacturer. the rna was eluted using 60 μl of rnase-free water and stored at -80°c. it was tested using the 5′utr rt-qpcr assay. for selected rnas the ready-to-go you-prime first-strand beads  were used to synthesize new cdna with random hexamer primers .

the fmdv cdna sequences were amplified using the reverse primer  <dig>  pn  <dig>   <cit>  and forward primers  <dig> -u pn e   <cit>  or 13-kpn  <dig> or 13-kpn  <dig> . the latter two primers were designed from the sequences of the kenyan sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  cattle samples from this study, respectively. the pcrs were performed as described previously  <cit>  and the products  were analysed by electrophoresis on  <dig>  % agarose gels  at  <dig> volts for 30 min. in parallel with a 1 kb dna ladder generuler® .table  <dig>

pcr products were purified using sigmaspin® sequencing reaction clean-up columns  following the manufacturer’s instructions. quantification of products and cycle sequencing were performed as previously described  <cit> . cycle sequencing in both directions was achieved using the same forward and reverse primers as for the rt-pcrs.

sequence assembly, alignment and analysis
the nucleotide sequences were assembled and edited using seqman pro software . serotype identification of the sequences was achieved by comparison with genbank data using the basic local alignment search tool   <cit> .

the buffalo and cattle vp <dig> coding sequences generated in this study were compared to selected fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> sequences from kenyan cattle determined in previous studies, from the wrlfmd  <cit>  and from genbank . sequence alignment was achieved using muscle  <cit>  incorporated in mega software version  <dig>   <cit>  and trimmed to  <dig> nucleotides encompassing the complete vp <dig> coding region of the viral rna genome. substitution models were also determined in mega <dig>  as earlier described  <cit> , briefly, maximum likelihood fits of  <dig> different nucleotide substitution models were estimated and akaike information criterion  was used. non-uniformity evolution rates were modelled using discrete gamma distribution  and the tamura nei substitution model with gamma distribution and invariable rates   was chosen  <cit> . the evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method  <cit>  and a bootstrap consensus tree estimated from  <dig> replicates  <cit> . percentage nucleotide differences among taxa in the data sets were calculated using mega <dig>   <cit>  and genetic distances compared using the p-distance.

RESULTS
none of the  <dig> buffalo sampled in this study had clinical signs suggestive of fmdv infections during the sampling, while all the  <dig> cattle samples analysed were from animals with apparent clinical signs of fmd .

amaasai-mara ecosystem; bmeru ecosystem; ctsavo ecosystem; dvnt assay did not detect any antibodies against fmdv serotypes o, a, c and sat  <dig>  epositive for both sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> 



serotype-specific antibodies against fmdv in buffalo sera detected by lpbe
generally, antibodies were detected by the lpbe against each of the six fmdv serotypes tested for . only three of the  <dig> buffalo samples were negative  for antibodies against all six serotypes tested for by lpbe, while  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> samples were positive for antibodies against all six, five, four, three, two and one serotype, respectively . moreover, high antibody titres  against serotypes o, a, sat  <dig>  sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> were found in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sera, respectively . the positive samples were distributed in the three ecosystems in different proportions as indicated in table  <dig>  i.e. sat  <dig> dominating in mme, o/sat  <dig> in me and sat 1/o in tse.

detection of neutralising antibodies against fmdv by vnt in buffalo sera
the buffalo sera were also tested in vnt assays. in contrast to the lpbe results, there was no evidence for the presence of neutralising antibodies against fmdv serotypes c and sat  <dig> among the  <dig> buffalo in the three ecosystems. only one and two sera had neutralizing antibodies against serotypes o and a, respectively; moreover, these three sera had higher or equal titres against sat  <dig> and/or sat  <dig> and thus the apparent presence of anti-o and anti-a antibodies may result from cross reactivity in the assays. in contrast, neutralising antibodies against serotypes sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> were detected in 44/ <dig>  and 53/ <dig>  samples, respectively. thirty of these samples were positive for antibodies against both serotypes and generally had higher titres against sat  <dig> than against sat  <dig>  while  <dig> and  <dig> samples only had antibodies against sat  <dig> or sat  <dig>  respectively . altogether  <dig> sera had neutralising antibodies against fmdv, including  <dig> of the  <dig> sera with antibodies against nsp, meaning that  <dig> and  <dig> sera only were positive in one of these test systems . the distribution of the positive sera between the three ecosystems is shown in table  <dig>  mme and me had higher levels of neutralising antibodies against sat  <dig> than against sat  <dig>  while tse predominantly had sat  <dig> neutralising antibodies.

presence of fmdv and fmdv rna in buffalo probang samples
among the buffalo probang samples, 43/ <dig>  had evidence of fmdv rna as detected by the 3d rt-qpcr assay on the original, non-passaged samples  with ct values ≤ <dig> and were distributed as follows: mme , me  and tse . twenty seven of these  <dig>  positive samples came from buffalo with neutralising antibodies against fmdv sat  <dig> and/or sat  <dig> 

the  <dig> buffalo probang samples that were positive in the 3d rt-qpcrs were inoculated onto bty cells. thirty three of these samples induced cpe, but only two of the cell harvests tested positive in the fmdv ag-elisa and were identified as sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  respectively . moreover, only these same two cell culture harvests  contained significant levels of fmdv rna  in the 5’utr rt-qpcr assay and were used for vp <dig> sequencing following rt-pcr.

presence of fmdv antigen and rna in cattle epithelia
all the  <dig> cattle epithelium samples  were positive on ag-elisa, and their distribution between the serotypes was as follows: o ; a ; sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  . all but two of the  <dig> cattle epithelial samples had ct values < <dig> and amplicons corresponding to the vp <dig> coding sequence were successfully generated and sequenced from  <dig> of them .

determination of vp <dig> coding region sequences
a total of  <dig> fmdv vp <dig> coding region sequences were successfully generated in this study . these comprised two buffalo sequences  and  <dig> cattle sequences . the buffalo sequences were identified as fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> originating from tse and mme, respectively, while the  <dig> cattle sequences were identified as o , a , sat  <dig>  or sat  <dig> . the serotype identification, based on the sequence comparison , of samples from both species corresponded to the ag-elisa results. the cattle viruses originated from various parts of the country and for the purpose of this study, only the  <dig> serotype sat  <dig> and the  <dig> sat  <dig> cattle sequences were included in the phylogenetic analysis presented here, while the serotype o and a sequences were analysed elsewhere  <cit>  .

statistical analysis and interpretation of fmdv prevalences in buffalo
the overall prevalence of antibodies against fmdv in buffalo as determined from the nsp assays was 64%, and the detection of fmdv rna in probang samples by 3d rt-qpcr was 42%. thirty seven of the  <dig>  animals with fmdv rna in the pharynx also had antibodies against fmdv nsps, while six buffalo had fmdv rna in their pharynx without being antibody positive and  <dig> buffalo had antibodies against nsp without fmdv rna in the pharynx . the two positive buffalo isolates came from animals that had rna in the pharynx, had antibodies against nsps and were sero-positive  for the same serotypes  of virus.

vp <dig> coding sequence analysis in this study
a total of  <dig> fmdv sat  <dig> and  <dig> sat  <dig> vp <dig> coding sequences  were analysed in combination with sequences derived from other fmdvs originating in kenya, other countries in eastern africa and also other regions of africa that were available from genbank and wrlfmd . the estimated phylogenetic trees, using the neighbor-joining method, for the sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> virus sequences are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.figure  <dig>

the four sat  <dig> vp <dig> coding sequences generated in this study comprised one  that was collected from a buffalo in tse in taita district, coast province, and three that were collected from cattle in different areas, namely taita-taveta , laikipia in rift valley province  and meru in eastern province  . the  <dig> buffalo isolate  clustered within the same topotype  as both recent and older fmdv cattle isolates from kenya but belonged to a separate, independently evolving lineage, from the cattle isolates . however, it shared a recent common ancestor with some recent kenyan cattle viruses including k159/ <dig>  k56/ <dig> and some of the  <dig> group of viruses. within the vp <dig> coding sequences, the buffalo kentse1/ <dig> isolate had 11%, 10% and 9% nt difference from these recent kenyan cattle virus sequences, respectively. in addition, kentse1/ <dig> had 10% and 13% nt difference from the isolate found in cattle in the same district   and from the current vaccine strain , respectively. this buffalo isolate also had >10% nt difference from the other cattle viruses collected in 2010- <dig> from various districts in various regions of the country . it is also noteworthy that these recent sat  <dig> cattle sequences clustered within a separate lineage from the current vaccine strain. when compared to other african buffalo derived fmdv sequences, it was apparent that the kentse1/ <dig> belonged to a separate topotype  . this isolate had 27% nt difference from the  <dig> buffalo isolate from neighbouring uganda , 23% nt difference from the  <dig> buffalo isolates from zimbabwe  and 24% nt difference from those collected in kruger national park  in south africa .

the sat  <dig> vp <dig> coding sequences included  <dig> sequences generated in this study . these comprised  <dig> cattle sequences from various regions of the country and one buffalo sequence  from mme in narok district of the rift valley province. the buffalo isolate grouped within the same topotype  as some tanzanian cattle viruses from  <dig> and the kenyan cattle viruses, including the viruses from 2004- <dig> and 2007- <dig>  but has evolved as an independent lineage . moreover, this kenyan buffalo isolate also belonged to a different lineage from the current vaccine strain   with 14% nt difference  in this part of the genome. comparisons of this buffalo isolate with the recent 2011- <dig> cattle viruses showed >13% nt difference. it was also notable that, these recent sat  <dig> cattle isolates clustered within a separate lineage  than the current vaccine strain . compared to the other buffalo sequences in eastern africa, kenmmb37/ <dig> belonged to a different topotype  and had on average >21% nt difference from the recent buffalo sat  <dig> ugandan viruses  that grouped within east africa topotype x . similarly, this kenyan buffalo sat  <dig> virus belonged to a different topotype from the  <dig> viruses from botswana and the 1991- <dig> south african  group of viruses and had on average, 20-30% nt differences from these viruses .

discussion
this study has characterised and compared fmdvs that have recently infected buffalo and cattle in kenya using a combination of assays. the priocheck® fmdv ns elisa demonstrated an overall seroprevalence of antibodies against fmdv nsps of 64% in the studied kenyan buffalo populations, which is comparable to the  <dig> % recorded by  <cit>  in buffalo in eastern africa but lower than the 74% and 85% reported in ugandan buffalo in 2001- <dig> and 2005- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . for comparison, the seroprevalence in kenyan cattle in  <dig> was  <dig> %  <cit> . the nsp antibody seroprevalence varied between the three investigated ecosystems, with the highest recorded in mme followed by me and lastly tse; this is comparable to the reported variation in buffalo nsp antibody seroprevalence between ugandan national parks  <cit> .

serotype-specific lpbe identified high titres  of antibodies against each of the six fmdv serotypes tested for, however, essentially only the antibodies against fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> were confirmed by vnt, suggesting high levels of cross-reactions in the commercial lpbe assay that was used. such cross-reactions have been experienced using other serotype-specific antibody elisas in buffalo populations in uganda  <cit>  and in eastern africa  <cit> , as well as with sera from fmdv infected cattle with fresh or healing lesions   <cit> . however, clearer results have been obtained using spbe in domestic ruminants sampled 2- <dig> months after infection  <cit>  and in pigs sampled during an outbreak of sat  <dig> in kenya  <cit> . moreover, since individual buffalo and buffalo herds are known to carry and maintain fmdv infections for a long time  <cit> , it is likely that they are continuously exposed to fmdvs, resulting in the existence of animals with multiple previous infections by the virus. therefore, high levels of cross-reactivity are to be expected due to boosting of antibodies against shared epitopes between the serotypes  <cit> . consequently, the serotype-specific elisas may not be expected to give clear results in free-ranging african buffalo, underpinning the necessity of collecting and sequencing the circulating fmdvs from this species  <cit> .

it is noteworthy that none of the sampled buffalo in this study had clinical signs suggestive of fmd, despite the fact that 42%  of the probang samples were positive for fmdv rna by rt-qpcr. furthermore, sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> fmdvs were each isolated from buffalo probang samples. this is not surprising because infection in african buffalo with fmdv has been known to be largely sub-clinical  <cit> ; thus our results concur with previous studies in the region  <cit>  and with three experimental infection studies in buffalo  <cit> .

in this study, we isolated and characterised two fmd viruses, one sat  <dig> and one sat  <dig>  from buffalo probang samples, while serotypes o , a , sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  fmdvs, respectively, were characterised directly from epithelial samples from acutely infected cattle from different regions of kenya. these findings agree with previous reports that have found these four serotypes in circulation in kenyan cattle  <cit>  and confirm the continued presence of multiple serotypes of fmdv in kenya since fmd was first diagnosed in  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the study also found that the recent sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> fmdvs in cattle and buffalo were divergent from the current vaccine strains, consistent with findings for serotypes o and a  <cit> . this finding raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of currently available vaccine strains against circulating viruses, suggesting the need for vaccine matching.

among the sat serotypes, the occurrence of sat  <dig> fmdv has been mainly associated with buffalo and neutralising antibodies against sat  <dig> have previously been demonstrated  in buffalo populations in kenya  <cit> , while in neighbouring uganda both antibodies  <cit>  and virus  <cit>  have been reported in buffalo. furthermore, the presence of sat  <dig> virus in a long horned ankole calf in uganda has recently been reported for the first time  <cit> . interestingly, the current study did not find sat  <dig> fmdv or neutralising antibodies against sat  <dig> , neither among cattle nor within the buffalo populations in the three ecosystems studied within kenya. these findings are consistent with reports from the wrlfmd  <cit>  and records at the fmdl, embakasi, that fmdv sat  <dig> has never been detected in kenya. similarly, there was no evidence for the presence of serotype c in either buffalo or cattle. this serotype has not been isolated in kenya since  <dig>  <cit> , although some serological evidence  for exposure to this serotype has been found recently among cattle in kenya  <cit> , buffalo in neighbouring uganda  <cit>  and regionally among cattle in eritrea  <cit>  and ethiopia  <cit> . there is a need for wider and more comprehensive studies among all fmdv susceptible species to verify the absence of these two serotypes in the country, considering the widespread movement of livestock and wildlife within and across national borders.

fmdv isolation, antigen detection elisa and sequencing have been commonly performed on cattle samples in kenya but rarely in other susceptible species  as is evident from the records of the fmdl, embakasi, the wrlfmd  <cit>  and from a recent study  <cit> . in the present study, the antigen elisa and sequencing were fully consistent with each other. taken together with the serological data, this study provided evidence that fmdv serotypes sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> are in circulation within the three buffalo ecosystems studied. this finding is consistent with an earlier field survey in  <dig> among buffalo in mme and cattle around this ecosystem which isolated fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> from buffalo  <cit> .

guided by the principles published for sat viruses that nt differences >20% define separate topotypes  <cit> , this study found that although the sat  <dig> buffalo virus identified in this study clustered within the same topotype  as both recent and older fmdv isolates from kenya, it belonged to a separate independently evolving lineage. interestingly, even one virus  from cattle in the same district  as the sat  <dig> buffalo isolate did not group within the same lineage. however, the phylogenetic tree also showed that although this buffalo virus has been evolving independently from the cattle viruses, they originated from a common ancestor , suggestive of an ancestral species jump  <cit> . a similar trend was observed with the sat  <dig> buffalo isolate kenmmb37/ <dig> collected from mme that belonged to the same topotype  as both recent and earlier sat  <dig> kenyan cattle viruses but had ≥13% nt difference from them, including a recent virus from narok district  in which mme is located .

these findings  are consistent with the idea that there may be largely independent cycles of fmdv circulations in kenya; one that occurs within buffalo populations and another within livestock populations, concurring with earlier observations indicating that eastern africa may be experiencing these separate fmdv cycles  <cit> . this idea is also consistent with the absence of evidence from the current study of other serotypes circulating among buffalo populations either from virological or serological assays, yet serotypes o and a were frequently found in cattle.

the findings in this study contribute to the debate of whether fmd is mainly a disease of livestock in endemic africa  <cit> . on the one hand, natural transmission from buffalo to livestock has been demonstrated in zimbabwe  <cit>  and south africa  <cit> , on the other hand, the real risks posed by carrier animals to susceptible hosts have not been adequately quantified  <cit> . however, the results presented here indicate that although other serotypes , together with sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> fmdvs are constantly circulating in kenyan cattle, buffalo mainly harbour sat serotypes. the current kenyan findings are in agreement with previous studies in eastern africa  <cit>  and consistent with wildlife playing a limited role in the epidemiology of fmd in cattle in eastern africa. however, owing to the limited number of buffalo viruses in our data set, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions.
