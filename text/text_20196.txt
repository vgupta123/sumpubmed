BACKGROUND
blood is a valuable resource to probe an animal’s physiological and pathological status as well as to obtain repeated samples before harvest, for example, monitoring the dynamic change of gene expression in response to disease, treatment, or aging, for which the onset of gene expression response is not known. however, transcriptomic analysis of blood samples is a challenge since blood is composed of heterogeneous cell types including red blood cells , platelets  and white blood cells   <cit> . in human blood, hba and hbb are the most abundant transcripts   <cit> . the high level of globin transcripts in blood was reported to be the most limiting factor for accurate and sensitive detection of gene expression, especially for the less abundant transcripts . this issue is a great concern for sequence-based approaches, in which the globin transcripts will be highly abundant and limit the potential coverage and detection of other transcripts from blood  <cit> .

to date, several globin rna reduction protocols have been successfully applied to gene expression studies in human . globincleartm , a commercial product widely used in human clinical research, removes up to 95% of the hba and hbb transcripts in human whole blood samples and improves the efficacy of gene expression assays  <cit> . further approaches developed by affymetrix   <cit>  or pna bio inc.   <cit>  also have differential reduction rates of globin transcripts in human blood. globin rna reduction improved the sensitivity and reproducibility of high throughput mrna expression analysis of whole human blood samples . there is, however, neither a commercial gr product available nor any literature demonstrating the efficiency and effects of gr at global level for porcine whole blood  <cit> .

our objectives were to develop a porcine specific gr protocol and to evaluate the effects of gr treatment on gene discovery and coverage in rna-seq experiments for swine.

RESULTS
comparisons of globin reduction methods
to determine the suitability of the gr process for porcine whole blood samples, we initially evaluated the efficacies of three distinct methods  with whole blood samples drawn from  <dig> pigs collected in either paxgenetm  or tempustm  tubes. to evaluate and compare gr efficiency, we performed qpcr analysis of hba and hbb transcripts with a pooled sample for globinclear and pna methods and  <dig> randomly selected samples for the rnase h method . the globincleartm-human kit , commonly used in human samples, seemed to have merit as it employs a non-enzymatic magnetic method but its reduction efficiency in pig barely reached 64% and 67% for hba and hbb transcripts, respectively . the manufacturer confirmed that porcine hba and hbb sequences had low sequence homology to their corresponding human oligonucleotide probes used in the globincleartm-human kit, but the degree of dissimilarity is not known because the human probe sequences used in the globincleartm kit are not publicly available. next, we designed porcine specific biotinylated pna oligonucleotides and used them with the globincleartm kit. this pna oligo method, however, reduced levels of hba and hbb transcripts only 40% and 34%, respectively . third, we evaluated the rnase h mediated gr method using porcine specific oligonucleotides modified from the affymetrix genechip gr protocol developed for reduction of human globin transcripts  <cit> . we examined the sequence similarities of hba and hbb, especially the oligonucleotide sequences on 3′ utr, between human and pig using clustal omega   <cit> . due to a lack of consensus, we designed two sets of porcine specific oligonucleotides each for hba and hbb . this revised rnase h mediated gr protocol resulted in an average reduction of 94% of hba and 92% of hbb transcripts from porcine whole blood samples . thus we determined that the rnase h gr method using our custom designed porcine specific oligos was the most efficient of the three gr methods tested here and confirmed its efficacy by rna-seq .table  <dig>

performance of gr protocol in an rna-seq experiment
after determining the valid and highly efficient gr method, we evaluated the effects of the rnase h gr treatment on gene discovery and coverage in an rna-seq experiment. since the above study on the gr method included samples collected using different blood collection tubes and rna isolation methods, we evaluated the effects of the rnase h gr treatment on gene discovery and coverage in an rna-seq experiment with a different set of  <dig> porcine blood samples collected in tempustm tubes and for which the rna was isolated by a magnetic bead based magmaxtm kit.

more than  <dig> million  sequence reads generated from  <dig> pre- and post-gr samples passed illumina’s casava  filtration . these reads were then aligned to the pig genome build  <dig>  by tophat . after gr treatment, total filtered reads and mapped reads were reduced by an average of  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m reads, respectively, and globin reads were reduced by an average of  <dig>  m reads. the percentage of globin reads among all aligned reads averaged  <dig> % and of these,  <dig> % were removed by gr treatment. the proportion of globin reads to mapped reads were  <dig> % and  <dig> % in pre- and post-gr samples, respectively, and proportions of hba and hbb reads to mapped reads were significantly reduced to  <dig> % from  <dig> % and to  <dig> % from  <dig> %, respectively . considering that human globin transcripts constitute 50-70% of the blood rna  <cit> , the level of pig globin transcripts in pre-gr samples is comparatively low. a possible explanation for the lower level of porcine globin transcripts is that the pigs used in this study were only 1- <dig> months old, an age associated with rapid decreases in erythrocyte population size and hemoglobin concentration. although pigs at birth have similar hematological values to adult pigs, by three days of age a 25% reduction in hemoglobin concentration has occurred and hemoglobin concentration then increased gradually from the age of  <dig> months due to the pig’s tremendous early growth rate, as much as eight times faster than humans  <cit> . thus, we expect the gr protocol will reduce more globin transcripts in newborn and adult pig blood rnas.table  <dig>

classification of samples based on rna integrity number 
we examined the rin changes after gr treatment of pig blood rna and its effect on sequencing results. the quality of rna was not changed overall ; though  <dig> samples showed a reduction in rin after gr treatment, only  <dig> samples showed a marked decrease of rin  after gr. however, there was a reduction in rna yield following gr treatment with only  <dig> - <dig> % of total rna being recovered. studies on gr treatment in humans also reported the reduction of rna yields ranging from 52-95% of total rna  <cit> . the reasons for the significant reduction and the wide variation in rna yield are not clear. to offset the rna loss accompanying gr treatment, it would be desirable to prepare sufficient amounts of initial rna. because we identified possible bias introduced by rin from the preliminary sequencing results , we empirically classified the samples into three categories based on rin after gr treatment: high , moderate , and low  representing ideal, critical and inferior rna integrity for rna-seq experiments, respectively.

increased coverage of non-globin genes in post-gr samples
following an approach similar to that described by mastrokolias et al.  <cit> , we investigated the effect of gr on enhancing the coverage of non-globin genes and the sensitivity of gene expression detection. read count data was normalized by library size and de genes between pre- and post-gr samples were determined using edger . compared to pre-gr samples,  <dig>  genes showed higher level of detection  and  <dig> genes , excluding hba and hbb and enssscg <dig> , showed lower level of detection after gr treatment  . we checked for sequence similarities among these  <dig> genes and the four globin oligonucleotides for possible non-target specific hybridization, but found none.

figure 2b depicts a heatmap of the normalized log <dig> transformed expression of the  <dig>  genes with higher level of detection in post-gr samples compared to pre-gr samples. it was observed that a large set of genes in the low rin samples  was considerably lower expressed than the corresponding set in the high/moderate rin samples, both pre- and post-gr. we believe that these are the genes with the greatest degradation in the low rin samples. we then examined the variation in gene body coverage from 5′ to 3′ in high/moderate and low rin samples, respectively. low rin samples showed strong bias toward increased coverage at the 3′ end . among the low-quality rna samples, pre- and post-gr treatment showed the same trend of bias, which affirmed that the rnase h treatment was not the determining factor. high quality samples showed better coverage from 5′ to 3′ as well as at the ends in both pre- and post-gr treated samples. all low quality samples were biased toward increased coverage at the 3′ end, possibly due to the degradation of rna. however, the number of unique genes detected did not differ significantly between low and high rin samples.table  <dig>

the lower detection levels of a small number of genes in post-gr samples could also be due to the effect of rin. we investigated all genes with decreased level of detection after gr  from each sample independently, regardless of statistical significance . we observed that samples with the most notable rin change after gr  had the highest number of genes with decreased expression level . in addition to the effect of rin, technical variations or sampling effects could also contribute to differences in detection levels of genes.

increased number of non-globin genes identified in post-gr samples
the number of detected genes  in post-gr samples was significantly increased compared to pre-gr samples  . gr treatment increased the gene detection rate by  <dig> % in high rin samples,  <dig> % in moderate and  <dig> % in low rin samples. it was also noticed that the number of additional genes identified in post-gr samples was higher for samples with a high rin . it may be noted that the detection rate was higher in high rin samples compared to low rin samples despite being sequenced at half the depth. pre-gr, an average of  <dig> genes were uniquely detected in the high rin group, whereas  <dig> genes were uniquely detected in the moderate/low rin group. post-gr, the corresponding uniquely detected genes in the two groups were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively .figure  <dig>

we next determined genes expressed in porcine whole blood using all  <dig> samples, based on the criterion that a gene was detected at read counts above  <dig> in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> samples. we identified  <dig>  genes in post-gr samples and  <dig>  genes in pre-gr samples with an overlap of  <dig>  genes . excluding the overlap,  <dig> genes were detected only in post-gr samples, whereas  <dig> were specific to pre-gr samples. the small number of genes found specific to pre-gr samples may be due to the effect of rin or technical variations. a comparison of the mean expressions of the set of  <dig>  genes detected in both pre- and post-gr samples and the  <dig> genes detected only in post-gr samples revealed increased expression in post-gr samples . the mean expression of the  <dig> additional genes in post-gr samples was well below the lower quartile of the expression levels of genes common to both pre- and post-gr samples. thus gr treatment increases the ability to detect genes expressed at very low levels.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
the porcine specific gr protocol described here successfully removed a significant proportion of the hba and hbb transcripts prior to sequence analysis. the range of gene discovery from rna sequencing was extended with significant increases in number of identified genes via improved coverage. our de analyses using the gr samples showed increased sensitivity, with no observed strong negative effects as a result of the gr protocol. we also demonstrated the effects of rin on blood rna-seq analyses. thus, the gr protocol incorporated into porcine blood transcriptomics will help advance pig physiological, pathological and blood biomarker studies, by providing more targets for drug development and disease resistance research.
