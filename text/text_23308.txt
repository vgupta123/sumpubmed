BACKGROUND
small rnas have been defined as  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide long rnas present primarily in metazoans and plants, classified as either a mirna, sirna or pirna based on biogenesis, and found to regulate gene expression through association with an argonaute family member . however, recently it has been shown that bacteria can use crispr rnas as a form of adaptive immunity  <cit>  and that a bacterial argonaute associates with small rnas preferentially derived from plasmids  <cit> , suggesting that rna interference may be more ubiquitous than previously appreciated. moreover, careful analysis of deep sequencing libraries has revealed many reads that cannot be assigned to known small rnas, and instead map to mrnas, snornas, rrnas, trnas or others , suggesting the existence of previously unappreciated classes of small rnas, some of which appear to be conserved among all domains of life.

the best studied of these new small rnas are fragments of trnas that correspond to half of a mature trna. first described in escherichia coli as a response to bacteriophage infection  <cit> , these fragments have been observed in numerous organisms and are commonly referred to as tirnas . these molecules are known to accumulate during stress, are generated by rny <dig> in yeast, angiogenin  in humans, and the 5’ halves have been shown to be capable of inhibiting protein translation in multiple organisms  <cit> , while either the 5’ halves or 3’ halves could theoretically associate with rnase z or rnase p, respectively, to slice target rnas  <cit> .

distinct from trna halves are the less well studied small rnas known as trna derived rna fragments . there are three types of trfs recognized, those derived from the extreme 5’ and 3’ ends of mature trnas , and those that map to the 3’ trailer fragment of precursor trna transcripts . these classes were first observed in lncap and c4- <dig> cells, and one trf- <dig> was found to promote cell proliferation  <cit> . soon after, numerous trf-5s were observed in hela cell nucleoli deep sequencing, and these small rnas were found to be weakly associated with argonautes  <dig> and  <dig>  and one was shown to be generated by dicer <dig>  <cit> . consistent with these previous reports, trf- <dig> and trf- <dig> sequences were reported in hek <dig> cells , and were shown to be primarily cytoplasmic  <cit> . this study also showed that trf-1s were formed by rnase z as expected, trf-3s and trf-1s preferentially associated with argonautes  <dig> and  <dig> over  <dig> and  <dig>  trf levels could affect the efficacy of mirnas and sirnas, and a trf- <dig> but not a trf- <dig> could act in trans rna silencing.

since the initial classification of trfs there have been multiple studies on trfs in organisms ranging from archaea to humans, and these studies have been summarized in several recent reviews  <cit> . these reviews highlight the conflicting reports of the biogenesis of trf-5s and trf-3s, with some original reports on these molecules implicating dicer <dig>  but a recent paper showing dicer <dig> is dispensable for the generation of most trf-5s and trf-3s  <cit> . several recent papers have also shown that trf-5s or trf-3s can associate with argonautes or participate in rna silencing  <cit> , while another paper argues trf-5s cannot silence a reporter gene but rather function similarly to 5’ trna halves and inhibit translation  <cit> . despite this growing literature on trfs there are still concerns that trfs could simply represent degradation products of their extremely abundant parental molecules, or concerns that the reads seen in deep sequencing are biologically relevant since it is known trna modifications can affect reverse transcriptase  <cit> .

we have taken advantage of the recent explosion of small rna-seq data and novel methods of mapping the mirna interactome to perform a meta-analysis of trfs and provide insight into their properties. our analysis of publicly available data sets clearly shows that trfs are drosha-, dicer1-independent precisely generated fragments present in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. we find that trf-5s and trf-3s, but not trf-1s, are very abundant in ago <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation  data and use canonical mirna seed rules to associate with mrnas. analysis of ago <dig> crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids  data suggests trf-5s and trf-3s may interact with thousands of different rnas in human cells.

despite the fact that trfs are more evolutionarily conserved than mirnas, are present in similar abundance, and are the only small rna to display clear argonaute sorting in humans, there is not a universally accepted nomenclature for trfs or unique identifiers for different trf sequences. as a result, it is possible for multiple labs to be working on the same trf without noticing it, for example, cand <dig> in  <cit>  is the same molecule as trf- <dig> in  <cit> , or for a trf to be misannotated as a mirna  <cit> . to help the community study this new class of small rna, we have created trfdb  <cit> , a relational database of trna derived rna fragments, with all the trf sequences which we have observed and unique identifiers. the names of datasets analyzed for each figure in this article are given in table  <dig> table  <dig>

RESULTS
trfs are created by specific cleavage sites
we mapped small rna reads from hek <dig> cells to a collapsed trna gene  and, as expected, observed large numbers of reads that mapped to either the 5’ end, 3’ end or trailer sequence, corresponding to trf-5s, trf-3s and trf-1s. surprisingly, when we plotted the frequency of unique trf reads of different lengths  we observed three peaks for trf-5s at ~ <dig>  ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> nts, and two peaks for trf-3s at ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> nts. to the best of our knowledge, these distinct populations of trf-5s and trf-3s have never been reported before. the 5’ ends of ‘3’ trna halves’ have 5’ hydroxyl rather than a 5’ phosphate and are biochemically different from trfs and other small rna. in addition, the trna halves are cleaved in the middle of the anticodon loop producing a  <dig> to 36 nt fragment making it possible to distinguish them from most trf-5s  with 3’ ends clearly in the stem and not in the anticodon loop itself. as shown in figure 1c, we have developed a nomenclature for these subclasses of trf-5s and trf-3s: 3’ cleavage at + <dig> , + <dig> to + <dig>  and + <dig> to + <dig> , 5’ cleavage at + <dig>  and + <dig> to + <dig> . the trf- <dig> cleavage sites are in the d loop, d stem or the 5’ half of the anticodon stem, while the trf- <dig> cleavage sites are both in the tΨc loop. these trf subclasses are seen in all human data sets analyzed from  <cit>  and are also conserved in mice, but become less distinct further down the evolutionary tree .figure  <dig>

most of the trf-1s observed in this data set are  <dig> to  <dig> bases long and always begin at the end of the trna gene sequence which becomes a mature trna, and end with a rna polymerase iii  transcription termination signal   <cit> . because the termination signal occurs at different locations in each pre-trna, trf-1s are predicted to vary in length and, as expected, we found a broad length distribution .

it is important to note that when looking at reads that map to a single trna, the peaks become much sharper . the precision with which individual trfs are generated strongly suggests that trfs are not generated by random exonucleolytic digestion of longer precursors. in addition, because the method of small rna sequencing in these data sets requires reverse transcriptase to read through the trf into the adaptor sequence, trna modifications would, if anything, lower the number of reads that we are observing, not create artificial short sequences.

trfs in different cell lines, organisms, and tissues
we next wanted to compare read counts for trfs in cell lines other than hek <dig> cells. we can observe read counts for all three classes of trfs for all cell lines in the  <cit>  data sets . in general trf-5s were present in higher abundance than trf-3s, and trf-3s were more abundant than trf-1s.figure  <dig>

 trf expression in different mouse tissues and embryonic stem cells .



to see if trfs are present in other species we analyzed the publicly available small rna data of mice  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  and the bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides  <cit> . trf-5s and trf-3s are observed in all the species . however fewer trf-1s were observed in drosophila ) and very few in c. elegans, s. cerevisiae and r. sphaeroides, although about  <dig>  rpm of trf-1s were detected in s. pombe.

the lower abundance of trf-1s in the lower eukaryotes and absence in bacteria could be explained if the 3’ trailer sequences of pre-trnas were not in the  <dig> to 36-nucleotide range that was selected for cloning and sequencing. indeed,  <dig> to  <dig> base-long pre-trna trailer sequences are ten-fold fewer in c. elegans and s. cerevisiae compared to human and mouse , which could account for the fewer trf-1s in the small rna libraries from these species. however, drosophila has comparable numbers of 3’ trailers in the correct size range, and yet yielded fewer trf- <dig>  while s. pombe had fewer 3’ trailers in the correct size range and yielded a large number of trf- <dig> clones. thus, some factor other than the possible number of 3’ trailers in the correct size range, such as protein binding partners, helps determine how many trf-1s are stable and identifiable in each species.

all the analyses of mammalian trfs until now have been performed against rna extracted from cell lines. to investigate if trfs are also expressed in normal mammalian tissues, we analyzed the small rna isolated from adult mouse ovary, testis and brain, and from mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells  <cit> . trfs are present in all the tissues analyzed , but the trf-5s and trf-3s were two- to five-fold less abundant in testes and brains compared to embryos, but as abundant in ovaries as in embryos. in contrast, the trf-1s were less abundant in adult tissues with the highest level seen in brain, and that, too, was five- to twelve-fold less that in mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells.

all trnas do not produce three trfs, and not all trfs are equally abundant
to determine if all trna genes produce all three types of trfs and, if they do, whether the trfs are in comparable abundance, we selected those trna genes where a trf- <dig> was detected in hek <dig> cells at > <dig> rpm. a given trf- <dig> has a unique sequence that can be assigned to a specific trna gene. when the 5’ and 3’ ends of more than one trna gene are identical in sequence, we classify them as a trna family. thus, we compare the cloning frequency of a specific trf- <dig> with that of the trf- <dig> or − <dig> derived from the corresponding family of trna genes. a trna family represents a group of genes encoding the same trf- <dig> or − <dig> sequences. these could include trna isoacceptors but are not necessarily so.

the sequencing frequencies of these matched sets of trfs were plotted . not all the trf types are detected for a given trna gene and family. for example, trf-5-sertga or trf-3-glytcc or -leuaag are selectively absent even though trf- <dig> were detected in all three cases.figure  <dig> 
a given trna does not yield trf- <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> at equal abundance.  number of reads per million of trf-5s, trf-3s and trf-1s from selected trna genes. the trna genes were selected on the basis of trf-1s that had > <dig> reads per million in hek <dig> human cell line library. the trf-1s were compared with trf-5s and -3s from the same trna, regardless of whether the trf- <dig> or − <dig> was derived from that specific trna gene or other members of the trna gene family. the duplicated trna genes  are marked with special character “*”, “#”, “$”, “%” and &.  scatter plots of trf-3s versus trf-5s, trf-1s versus trf-3s, and trf-1s versus trf-5s for the trna genes shown in a along with pearson correlation coefficients.



when all three trfs from a given trna gene or family are detected, their cloning frequencies are not similar. for example, trna4-leutaa produces a trf- <dig> that is nearly 40- to 50-fold more abundant than the trf- <dig> or − <dig> generated from the leutaa trna family, and the pearson correlation coefficients between trf-5s and trf-3s , trf-3s and trf-1s  and trf-5s and trf-1s  are very low . the lack of a correlation between the concentrations of trf- <dig>  − <dig> or − <dig> from a given trna gene  further supports the hypothesis that trfs are non-random, stable products derived from specific trnas and pre-trnas.

processing of trfs is distinct from mirna biogenesis
to study the role of dicer <dig> in the generation of trfs, we investigated the high throughput sequencing data of short rnas from the wild type and dicer <dig> mutants isolated under similar conditions from the same experiments. such data were available for three species, that is, mouse  <cit> , s. pombe  <cit>  and two data sets for drosophila  <cit> . mutation of dicer <dig>  did not significantly decrease the expression of any of the three classes of trfs in mice , s. pombe  and drosophila , in contrast to the nearly hundred-fold suppression of the cloning frequency of several micrornas in mouse  and three- to twenty-fold suppression in drosophila . dgcr <dig>  was similarly dispensable for trf generation . dicer- <dig> and the double strand rna binding protein r2d <dig> are involved in the biogenesis of sirna in drosophila. mutation of dicer- <dig> or r2d <dig> did not decrease the expression of trf- <dig> or − <dig> either . although r2d <dig> mutation decreased trf- <dig> levels to about 40%, in the context of all the other mutants, we conclude that the proteins involved in generating canonical mirnas or sirnas are dispensable for the generation of trfs in mice, drosophila and s. pombe.figure  <dig>

trf-5s are nuclear while trf-3s and -1s are cytoplasmic
to determine the cytoplasmic or nuclear location of trfs we analyzed the small rna of  <dig> to  <dig> bases isolated separately from nuclei and whole cell fraction of hela cell line  <cit>  . the trf-5s were equally abundant in the whole cell and nuclear fractions, suggesting that they are mostly present in the nucleus, consistent with the observation of large numbers of trf-5s in hela cell nucleoli  <cit> . trf-3s and trf-1s were much more abundant in the whole cell fraction compared to the nuclear fraction suggesting that both species are almost exclusively in the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the findings of  <cit> . the specific subcellular localization of the classes of trfs raises questions about their biogenesis and functions. we note that in most analyzed short rna libraries we see an abundance of trfs in the order trf-1 < trf-3 < trf- <dig> ; however, the reverse trend was observed in short rna libraries generated from the whole cell and nuclear fractions . this may be due to variations in the protocol used by the lab that produced these libraries, but the effect should be the same on both the nuclear and whole cell libraries. thus, we do not expect such variations to uniquely enrich trf- <dig> in the nuclear fraction compared to trf- <dig> or trf- <dig> 

trf-5s and trf-3s associate with ago <dig>   <dig>  and 4
we investigated the association of trfs with human argonautes by analyzing the human ago <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> par-clip data isolated from hek <dig> cell lines  <cit> . in par-clip, when the 4-thiouridine is crosslinked to the protein of interest, it often becomes mutated to a cytidine during library preparation. positional t to c mutation analysis of the data provides information about the rna-protein interaction. in the presented analysis we allow 1 t/c mutation and give preference for perfect mappings . read counts for trf-5s and trf-3s are comparable to mirnas for ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig>  but are nearly absent in ago <dig>  while there are almost no read counts for trf-1s for all four argonautes . since this is the first time a class of small rna has been reported to show differential human argonaute sorting, we were interested if we could observe this trend in other data sets. ago <dig> and ago <dig> hek <dig> cell par-clip was also performed by  <cit>  and analysis of this data again showed this same pattern . unfortunately, we are unaware of any mouse ago <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> clip or par-clip data, so we could not repeat this analysis for mice, but we do note that only very small numbers of trfs are seen in mouse ago <dig> clip data  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

trf-3s and trf-5s bind to human argonautes like mirnas
as reported in  <cit> , mirnas are crosslinked to the ago protein at specific positions, namely positions  <dig> to  <dig>  and this is borne out by a high t to c mutation frequency at these positions and very low mutational frequency at other positions, particularly the first  <dig> positions, that constitute the ‘seed’ and are involved in base-pairing with the target rna. we first checked if we could replicate these results with our algorithms , and we were able to detect a high percentage of t to c mutations at positions  <dig> to  <dig> for mirnas and a very low frequency at the first  <dig> positions. we next checked whether trf-3s display a similar pattern of mutations since this would indicate a similar binding mode and perhaps function. as with mirnas, we saw a very low mutation frequency for the first  <dig> positions and peaks between positions  <dig> to  <dig>  the slight difference in mutational frequencies between mirnas and trf-3s could be due to a sampling bias since trf-3s contain fewer ts than mirnas, and the ts that are present are not as randomly distributed as in mirnas. alternatively, this difference could indicate a biologically relevant distinction in the way trf-3s interact with argonautes. the t to c mutational frequency of trf-5s also shows protection from cross-linking of the first six residues , suggesting that these bases are facing away from the argonaute in an orientation suitable for binding to a target rna, that is, they represent a seed region. the maximal t-c change is observed at base  <dig>  and not at bases  <dig> to  <dig>  unlike what is observed with micrornas and trf-3s. this is partly because trf-5s are enriched in us at base  <dig>  but may also be because some of them  form a slightly different complex with argonautes because they are longer at  <dig> bases than mirnas and trf-3s.

trf-3s associate with target rnas via canonical seed sites
in addition to mirnas being cross-linked at specific positions in par-clip, target rnas are also preferentially cross-linked at a certain position with respect to the risc complex: in the middle of the complex immediately preceding the sequence annealed to the microrna seed. this information was used in  <cit>  to generate  <dig>  crosslink-centered regions  of rnas present in the par-clip data. ccrs are 41 nt long sequences centered at the t that showed the highest t to c frequency. they demonstrated that the reverse complement of known mirna seeds is enriched in ccrs directly following this central cross-linked t. we reproduced this observation by taking the  <dig> most abundant mirnas in ago <dig> par-clip data and scanning the  <dig>  ccrs with different seed definitions . as expected, the canonical seed sites 7mer-a <dig>  and 7mer-m <dig>  produce the largest number of matches, and at the expected position in the ccrs, immediately downstream from the cross-linked t. the less canonical seed sequences, such as bases  <dig> to  <dig> of the micrornas, produce fewer matches with the ccrs, and microrna positions that have never been recognized as seeds produce even fewer.

given that we saw similar patterns of t to c mutations for trf-3s and mirnas, we were emboldened to test whether the 5’ ends of trf-3s act as seeds to select matching target ccrs, with the match at a location in the ccr that is immediately downstream of the central cross-linked t. as with mirnas, the two best seed definitions of trf-3s that matched ccrs are the canonical 7mer-a <dig> and 7mer-m <dig> . however, while mirnas seemed to show a preference for the 7mer-m <dig> site over the 7mer-a <dig> site, trf-3s had the opposite preference. again, this could represent sampling bias, or it may hint at a rna-induced silencing complex  that is fundamentally different. significantly, the best complementary matches to the trf- <dig> seeds were also immediately downstream of the central t in the ccrs, just as seen with the mirnas. seeds of trf-5s also show matches above background with canonical sites in the ccrs , but trf-1s do not show matches above background .

clash data indicates trf-3s and trf-5s target thousands of rnas
clash is a new technique that has recently been used to study the ago1-mirna-target rna interactome in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . briefly, the technique is similar to clip, but with the addition of a ligation step that connects the 3’ end of the ago bound small rna to the 5’ end of the target rna. to analyze this data we found reads that started with either a mirna or trf, and then performed blastn with the rest of the sequence against human ref-seq rna . in our analysis we see  <dig> hoxc8-mir-196a/b chimeric reads, which corresponds closely to the  <dig> chimeric reads identified by helwak et al  <cit> . surprisingly, despite mirnas being more abundant, we saw more trf-3-mrna chimeras than mirna-mrna chimeras . we also observed numerous trf-5-mrna chimeras, but very few trf-1-mrna chimeras, which is consistent with our par-clip analysis . manual observation of some of the more abundant trf-3-mrna chimeras shows nice clustering of the mrna portions of the reads . examples of some of the most abundant trf-mrna interactions are shown with their predicted mfold structures , and a list of all trf-mrna chimeric reads can be found in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
the recent increase in small rna-seq data and novel methods to investigate the mirna-interactome allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of the properties of trfs. we have shown that trfs are very precisely generated fragments that are present in all cell lines investigated and in organisms ranging from humans to bacteria. using well-established par-clip data we showed that trf-5s and trf-3s clearly associate with human argonautes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but show little to no association with ago <dig>  although argonaute sorting is common in some organisms such as plants, this has not been seen in humans before. trf-5s and trf-3s also match clusters observed in par-clip data with canonical seed rules, indicating that ago-trf complexes are able to associate with rnas. clash analysis confirmed this hypothesis by the observation of large numbers of trf-mrna chimeras.

this investigation raises many questions about the biology of trfs and small rnas in general. if dicer <dig> and drosha are not involved in trf generation then which proteins are? do all organisms generate trfs by the same pathway? do trfs associate with argonautes in other organisms? is the lack of association with ago <dig> telling us something about risc assembly in humans? and will the traditional methods for studying mirnas  be applicable to a small rna whose parental rna is one of the most abundant rnas in the cell?

these questions are too much for any one group to answer, but it is tempting to speculate as to the possibilities. trnas are heavily modified and it is known that some of these modifications affect trna stability. indeed, lack of a specific trna modification has been shown to increase trna half generation  <cit> . this suggests that there may be other modifications which can affect trf- <dig> or trf- <dig> generation.

the matches to par-clip clusters and the large number of clash chimeras point to a role for trfs in rna silencing. in fact, it is known that a large number of clip-seq clusters are not able to be assigned to mirna seeds  <cit> . thus far, the scientific community has explained this fact by proposing noncanonical seeds, such as those that contain bulges, but it may be that these orphan clusters are targeted by trfs. however, it is important to keep an open mind for the function of trfs. for example, a recent publication showed that a trf- <dig> which our lab previously identified is able to serve as a primer for htlv- <dig> reverse transcriptase  <cit> . in addition, some of the most abundant trf- <dig> chimeras we observe are with histone mrnas. histone mrnas are known as the only mrnas in the cell to not contain a poly-a tail, thus these interactions cannot result in traditional degradation of the mrna target. however, the binding site for a large number of the interactions is very close to the stem loop, indicating the trf-3s could compete with stem-loop binding protein and affect the mrna stability via this mechanism.

in addition, although mirna-argonaute complexes are traditionally thought to function in the cytoplasm, increasingly diverse functions for argonautes in the nucleus continue to be discovered . for example, there have been recent reports of transcriptional gene silencing by short rnas and regulation of alternative splicing by argonaute and related piwi proteins in mammals. the presence of trf-5s in the nucleus and the association of trf-5s with ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> suggest that trf-5s may participate in these processes.

although there has been a steady increase in trf literature since their discovery, our current knowledge of trfs clearly pales in comparison to other small rnas. we have shown that trfs display similar properties to mirnas, and given the importance of mirnas in processes ranging from development to cancer, it is not far-fetched to imagine equally important functions for trfs.

CONCLUSIONS
trfs are a newly discovered class of small rna that are highly abundant in different human cell lines, mouse tissues and organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. individual trfs show a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the fragments are precisely generated and not degradation products of trnas. mutation of different components of the mirna biogenesis pathway does not have an effect on trf levels, and trfs are seen in organisms that do not contain mirnas, indicating trf generation is distinct from mirna biogenesis. in human hek  <dig> cells trf-5s and trf-3s are associated with argonautes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as evidenced by par-clip data. these trfs contain seed sequences, which match the central portion of large numbers of ccrs. this observation, along with the finding of thousands of trf-mrna chimeras in clash data, indicates trf-3s and trf-5s can target rnas in a manner similar to mirnas.
