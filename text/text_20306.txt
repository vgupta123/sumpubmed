BACKGROUND
acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative pathogen associated with multidrug resistance and hospital outbreaks of infection, particularly in the intensive care unit  <cit> . a. baumannii accounts for almost 80 % of all reported acinetobacter infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, peritonitis, urinary tract infections, and wound infections  <cit> . the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant a. baumannii strains has resulted in limited treatment options, with most strains being resistant to clinically useful antibiotics  <cit> . a. baumannii cells readily form biofilms in vitro , and the ability of nosocomial strains to form biofilms on medical devices as in host tissues represents an important factor of microbial virulence. cells forming biofilms are embedded within a polymeric conglomerate of proteins and polysaccharides. biofilms are resistant to host immune defenses, detergents and antibiotics, and antibiotic resistance of microrganisms in these habitats can be increased up to a thousand-fold  <cit> .

as in other microrganisms  <cit>  also in a. baumannii the formation of biofilm is a redundantly organized, multifactorial process involving multiple cellular components. the initial cell attachment to a surface is plausibly mediated by pili-like structures encoded by the csu locus  <cit> , which are widespread among clinical isolates. however, the strong biofilm producer atcc <dig> strain lacks csu-encoded pili, as the atcc <dig> strain which expresses a different type of pili  <cit> . biofilms eventually grow by production of poly-beta--n-acetylglucosamine controlled by the pga locus  <cit> . the extracellular matrix provides adhesion between bacterial cells, enabling the formation of a multilayered structure. several surface proteins are also involved in the process, and appear to differently contribute to the attachment of cells to biotic or abiotic surfaces. the major outer membrane protein ompa is essential for the attachment of a. baumannii to human alveolar epithelial cells, but plays a role also in the development of biofilms on plastic  <cit> . in contrast, both cell adhesiveness and biofilm formation are high in a. baumannii isolates expressing the per- <dig> extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  <cit> .

inactivation of a protein called bap  in the st   <dig> ab307- <dig> strain resulted both in decreased biofilm growth on glass  <cit>  and decreased adherence to human bronchial cells  <cit> . bap is expressed at the cell surface, and biofilm formation by bap-positive strains is inhibited by affinity-purified bap antibodies  <cit> . baps are large multidomain proteins playing a role in the process of biofilm formation both in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . these proteins exhibit poor sequence similarity, but share structural similarities, as they are internally repetitious and feature multiple  immunoglobulin-like domains. these domains have a peculiar three-dimensional structure known as ig fold, composed of 70– <dig> amino acid  residues in seven anti-parallel beta-strands organized in two beta-sheets packed against each other in a sandwich structure  <cit> . in s. epidermidis, the embp  protein, involved both in cell adherence and biofilm formation  <cit> , is enriched in modules different from ig-fold repeats called fivar  and ga .

in different species, bap genes are accessory genome components. the e. faecalis bap gene is inserted in a  <dig> kb pathogenicity island, the s. aureus bap gene in a composite transposon comprising an abc transporter operon and a transposase, in turn inserted in the 27 kb mobile pathogenicity island sapibov <dig>  <cit> . the gene was identified in 5 % of the s. aureus bovine mastitis, but in none of the human s. aureus isolates studied  <cit> . s. epidermidis isolates from animal mastitis forming biofilms possess a gene highly homologous to the s. aureus bap gene, but not other sapibov <dig> sequences. similarly, the bhp  protein is present only in some human s. epidermidis biofilm producers, as the rp62a strain  <cit> .

in contrast, the bap gene is largely conserved in the a. baumannii population, having been identified in isolates belonging to different sts  <cit> . differently from other species, in a. baumannii the bap gene is unlinked to genes involved in protein secretion. the bap detected in a. baumannii st <dig> isolates is approximately four times smaller than the ab307- <dig> protein  <cit> . size heterogeneity plausibly denotes changes in the number of protein repeats due to reca-independent slipped-strand mispairing during dna replication, as reported for s. aureus bap variants  <cit> .

in this work, we have studied the organization of bap coding sequences in wholly sequenced strains as in a large set of whole genome shotguns  of both a. baumannii  and other acinetobacter species. in silico analyses had been carried out also for two surface proteins, that we have called blp <dig> and blp <dig>  structurally related to bap because similarly containing ig-like domains. we showed that a. baumannii baps come in different formats, for changes in the number and type of repeats, and organization of the cooh region. data mining suggest functional hierarchy linking bap to blps, a hypothesis strengthened by the observation that gene disruption of either blp gene impaired biofilm formation and adhesiveness to epithelial cells.

RESULTS
heterogeneity of bap proteins among a. baumannii strains
the bap protein identified in the a. baumannii strain ab307- <dig> contains  <dig> aa, and features seven distinct repeat units ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> aa. repeats a-d exhibit poor similarity to each other, but all share big_3_ <dig>  motifs, fitting the consensus tdnagn, found in many bacterial surface proteins . b, c and d repeats are over-represented, and account for 2/ <dig> of the ab307- <dig> bap. repeats e, f and g lack big_3_ <dig> motifs, and are reiterated in tandem in the cooh region. a third g-like repeat is located downstream at  <dig> aa distance. a-g repeat sequences are reported in additional file  <dig> 

in bap proteins found in wholly-sequenced a. baumannii genomes , the nh <dig> region is conserved, the cooh region varies in length because either  <dig> or  <dig> copies of the efg module are present . small and large cooh regions, which exhibit 44 % sequence identity, mark baps encoded by strains belonging to the abundant sequence types st <dig> and st <dig>  which correspond to international clone i and ii, respectively  <cit> . accordingly, the corresponding proteins have been classified as type- <dig> and type- <dig> baps. length and composition of the central repetitive region is also variable. according to genbank annotations, intact baps are encoded by the aye  and bjab <dig>  strains only, while the  <dig> aa ab307- <dig> protein described by loehfelm and coworkers  <cit>  is split in orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  the discrepancy may either signal that a mutation occurred in the ab307- <dig> bap gene prior to whole-sequencing, or denote sequencing errors. in this context, it may be worth noting that the salmonella thyphimurium lt <dig> strain encodes a 386 kda bap, but the corresponding gene is annotated in genbank as a pseudogene because of a frameshift mutation  <cit> . in other a. baumannii genomes, bap homologous sequences are split in two or more orfs . it is unlikely to hypothesize in all instances that the fragmentation reflects sequencing errors, sequencing data having been obtained by different investigators. in several st <dig> strains , bap prematurely terminates at residue  <dig>  the corresponding cooh region, preceded by a variable number of repeats, is encoded by downstream flanking orfs. this finding and the size identity of small bap orfs in mdr-tj and acicu strains, both support the notion that allelic bap-negative variants, spread by horizontal gene transfer, may be common in the bacterial population. in the atcc <dig> and a <dig> strains, the bap gene was disrupted by a  <dig> kb dna insertion in tyth- <dig>  and by chromosomal rearrangements moving away, or flipping the nh <dig> and cooh regions. in six strains, either the nh <dig> or the cooh region is missing, in ac <dig> the two regions are at  <dig>  mb distance .fig.  <dig> organization of baps coding sequences in wholly sequenced a. baumannii genomes. the organization of coding sequences homologous to bap  <cit>  in wholly sequenced a. baumannii genomes deposited at the kegg  site is depicted. boxes denote nh <dig> and cooh regions, ovals modules of the repetitive region. modules within small orfs spanning the repetitive region in different clones have not been reported for clarity. numbers in parenthesis denote orfs, numbers to the right of each protein the strain st



bap in a. baumannii draft genomes
data in fig.  <dig> suggest that bap may be an accessory, dispensable gene expressed by subsets of the a. baumannii population only. to learn more, bap homologs were searched by tblastn in a large set of draft genomes of a. baumannii. mlst analyses were performed at the a. baumannii mlst website  using the “pasteur” mlst scheme  <cit> . only strains which could be assigned to an st were selected for further studies. the degree of identity of rpob gene sequences helped to reassign several strains annotated as a. baumannii to other species. on the whole, the a. baumannii strains analyzed in this work  are  <dig> and belong to  <dig> different sts . for sake of simplicity, hereon draft genomes and/or the corresponding strains will be referred to by the four-letter code in the genbank accession number .

intact bap coding sequences have been identified only in the ayoi  and jevz  strains. in a few high quality draft genomes , bap coding sequences resided in one contig, but were interrupted by stop codons, and split into two or multiple orfs, as in many wholly sequenced genomes shown in fig.  <dig>  in the remaining wgs, sequences encoding nh <dig> and cooh bap regions, flanked by segments of the central repetitive region of variable lengths, were at the termini of two contigs. the stop codon at bap residue  <dig> found in several wholly-sequenced genomes is a signature conserved in 42 %  of the st <dig> strains analyzed. given the prevalence of st <dig> strains, interrupted bap genes may be frequent in the a. baumannii population.

the nh <dig> and cooh regions were conserved in most of the clones analyzed. changes in the region encompassing the terminal  <dig> aa mark bap-2b and bap-2c variants which exhibited  <dig> and 41 % identity to bap- <dig> in the diversity region, respectively. bap-2b have been found in all the  <dig> st <dig> strains analyzed and two st <dig> strains , bap-2c in the single st <dig> apra and the st <dig> jexu strains.

changes in the composition of the bap repetitive region were also observed. a novel ig-like z repeat unrelated to a-d repeats was identified in  <dig> strains belonging to  <dig> different sts. as sketched in fig.  <dig>  the overall module organization in z-positive and z-negative regions differs. type- <dig> baps have the same nh <dig> region of type- <dig> and type- <dig> baps, but differ both in the repetitive and the cooh regions. the repetitive region features d, zb , w and y modules . the cooh region  of type- <dig> bap exhibits only 40 % identity to the corresponding region of type- <dig> or type- <dig> baps. efg modules are absent, but a tract of approximately  <dig> aa, exhibiting 50 % identity to g repeats, could be identified. the  <dig> clones carrying type- <dig> baps belong to  <dig> different sts, and about half of them belong to st <dig>  type- <dig> baps are relatively limited in size, the largest complete protein found in the afdl strain measuring  <dig> aa . here too, however, it must be emphasized that the complexity of the repetitive region might have been missed in sequencing assembly.fig.  <dig> repeat modules in type- <dig>  type- <dig> and type- <dig> baps. bars denote undefined repeat regions in z-plus type- <dig> and type- <dig> baps. afdl, aepm and afda clones potentially express a complete type- <dig> bap



on the whole, strains encoding type- <dig>  type- <dig> and type- <dig> bap belong to  <dig>   <dig> and 11 % of the sts analyzed. the remaining sts lack bap, or carry truncated forms of the protein.

bap-like proteins encoded by the a. baumannii sdf strain
the a. baumannii sdf strain, isolated from a human body lice  <cit>  encodes two unusual bap-like proteins, absdf <dig>  and absdf <dig> , which exhibit significant homology to baps at the nh <dig> terminus only. in both, ig-like repeats are replaced by long stretches of alternating serine  and aspartic acid  residues .

baps in other acinetobacter species
bap proteins occur in the genomes of several non-baumannii acinetobacter strains . the list includes the a. baylyi adp <dig>  all the strains classified as a. calcoaceticus , a. pittii , and a. radioresistens , as several a. haemolyticus  and a. nosocomialis  strains, only one  of the six strains classified as a. junii  bap proteins are missing in a. johnsonii and a. lwoffii.

acinetobacter baps have been classified as alpha or beta for the presence of either ig-like or sd repeats as repetitive modules, respectively, and assigned to  <dig> types on the basis of their cooh regions . in addition to a. baumannii, type- <dig> and type- <dig> baps have been found in a. calcoaceticus, a. pittii and a. nosocomialis, while type- <dig> baps are confined to a. baumannii. a. baylyi and a. radioresistens bap-like proteins markedly differ from a. baumannii baps because the repetitive region features either highly divergent copies of a single ig-like module , or novel ig-like modules interrupted by foreign aa stretches  .fig.  <dig> alpha and beta baps. changes in the organization of the  <dig> bap types found in the acinetobacter genus are highlighted. bau, a. baumannnii; sdf, a. baumannnii sdf; hae, a. haemolyticus; pit, a. pittii; nos, a. nosocomialis; bay, a. baylyi, rad, a. radioresistens, cal, a. calcoaceticus. cal <dig> and cal <dig> refer to the wholly sequenced a. calcoaceticus phe-a <dig>  <cit>  strain and the draft genomes deposited at the ncbi, respectively. sequences conserved at the end of all bap types are in orange. for sake of simplicity difference in the cooh regions among baps are not highlighted. e, g, f and b modules are depicted as in fig. 1




type- <dig> and type- <dig> beta-baps differ for the presence/absence of b modules in the repeat region. curiously, a. pittii and a. calcoaceticus strains producing beta-baps potentially encode also alpha type- <dig> baps. a. haemolyticus type- <dig> baps are hybrid alpha/beta proteins which resemble type- <dig> baps in the cooh region, but feature long tracts of alternating aa in the repetitive region. the complete proteins encoded by the a. haemolyticus atcc <dig> and tg <dig> strains feature  <dig> sd pairs and 148 ad pairs, respectively.

the nh <dig> region is largely conserved in all baps, but three main variants, denoted by the color code in fig.  <dig>  could be recognized . curiously, the a. baumannii and a. haemolyticus nh <dig> regions both feature a  <dig> aa insertion mostly made by tandem da repeats. significant similarities of the cooh regions of the various bap types are limited to the terminal 100– <dig> aa. it may be worth noting that only g modules are conserved in many baps .

the analysis of wholly sequenced genomes showed that alpha- and beta-bap genes map at different chromosomal sites. the alpha gene region is conserved in a. baumannii, a. calcoaceticus phe-a <dig> and a. baylyi adp <dig> genomes. in the a. baumannnii sdf strain, the region is also conserved, but is occupied by the beta-bap absdf <dig> gene. the beta gene region is located on genomic islands, flanked by lapebc genes coding for components of a type-i secretion system, both in a. calcoaceticus phea- <dig> and a. baumannii sdf strains . sd-rich adhesion protein genes flanked by lap genes have been found in different gram-negative microrganisms, such as klebsiella pneumoniae mgh  <dig> , and enterobacter aerogenes ea1509e .

additional proteins with ig-fold motifs encoded by a. baumannii
in a. baumannii, two additional proteins were found to contain ig-like repeats. the proteins, variously named in different annotations, have been named, for sake of simplicity, blp <dig> and blp <dig>  both blps and bap share a sequence motif at the nh <dig> terminus. blp <dig> and bap feature cooh-terminus aa sequences similar to those found in rtx toxins, proteins secreted through a type i secretion system . in the aye strain, blp <dig> and blp <dig> correspond to orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and bap to orf  <dig>  bap and blp <dig> genes are thus very close , and their relative position is conserved in all strains examined.fig.  <dig> conserved motifs in bap, blp <dig> and blp <dig>  sequence motifs conserved at the termini of the three proteins are highlighted. rtx refers to the  <dig> aa rtx toxin  encoded by the a. baumannii acicu strain



blp <dig> and blp <dig> exhibit the same tripartite structure of bap . in blp <dig>  the repetitive region is made up by four different repeat types , all but q featuring big_3_ <dig> motifs . blp <dig> vary in length from  <dig> to  <dig> aa. blp <dig> has a small number of repeats, and complete proteins have been identified in about 60 % of the examined wgs. aminoacids changes let to distinguish type- <dig> and type- <dig> blp <dig> variants, exhibiting 86 % identity in a  <dig> aa domain of the cooh region. the nomenclature reflects the occurrence of type- <dig> and type- <dig> blp <dig> in clones of the predominant st <dig> and st <dig> types. type- <dig> variants featuring a more extensive remodeling of the variable domain are encoded by a few strains, each belonging to a different st, and have been named h and k variants .fig.  <dig> 
a. baumannii blp <dig> and blp <dig> proteins. the modular organization of the two proteins is diagrammed. the  <dig> aa “unique region” between p and q repeats in blp <dig> is depicted by a bar



blp <dig> features a simple repetitive region made by only four t repeats, and a relatively small  cooh region. the protein is conserved in most of the strains examined, and four main sequence variants  could be recognized. the a-type has been found in >70 %  of the sts examined, including the predominant st <dig> and st <dig>  the minor b, c and d variants, which exhibit decreasing similarity to the a-type protein, have been found in  <dig>   <dig> and just  <dig> sts, respectively. in both c- and d-type proteins, the ig-like domain of one t repeat is mutated .

in contrast to blp <dig>  blp <dig> had been identified only in 80 % of the clones analyzed. blp1-negative strains fall into two distinct groups. in the jfxh, apwv and atgj strains, the blp <dig> coding region had been completely or partly deleted. in the majority of blp1-negative strains, however, the blp <dig> coding region is invariably replaced by a 99 bp dna tract .

blps in other acinetobacter species
blp <dig> and blp <dig> genes were searched in non-baumannii acinetobacter genomes . a. calcoaceticus and a. pittii strains encode both blps, a. haemolyticus and a. nosocomialis strains blp <dig> only. in all the blp1-negative species, sequences homologous to the 99 bp dna tract found in the a. baumannii blp1-negative clones could be identified . the presence/absence of blp <dig> in the a. baumannii population can thus be rationalized by hypothesizing that the blp <dig> gene region had been replaced by the corresponding “empty site” upon recombination with non-baumannii cells. exchange of the blp <dig> locus among acinetobacter cells is frequent, as indicated by the spread in a. baumannnii of the h and k blp <dig> variants found in a. calcoaceticus and a. pittii strains.

a. johnsonii, a. lwoffii and a. junii strains lack both blp <dig> and blp <dig>  in 5/ <dig> a. junii genomes analyzed, blp2-like genes are inactivated by a frameshift mutation, separating nh <dig> and cooh regions into two orfs, and the bap gene is missing. only the a. junii appw strain encodes an intact blp <dig>  and is worth noting that only this strain potentially encodes also a bap protein.

sequence type distribution of bap, blp <dig> and blp2
the distribution of bap, blp <dig> and blp <dig> among analyzed sts is summarized in additional file  <dig>  a close look at data support the notion that the three proteins may be functionally related. blp <dig> seems ancillary to bap, since it is missing in almost all the sts  which lack bap. among bap-positive strains, the blp <dig> gene is unevenly distributed. blp <dig> was found in most  sts expressing a type- <dig> bap, 60 % of sts expressing a type- <dig> bap, only in one of the  <dig> sts expressing a type- <dig> bap. moreover, type- <dig> bap and type- <dig> blp <dig> are more frequently associated than type- <dig> bap and type- <dig> blp <dig>  thus, the coexistence of some blp <dig> and bap variants may be preferred, while specific combinations may plausibly be disadvantageous, and this may explain the exchange of filled/empty blp <dig> sites observed in the population. blp <dig> is conserved in most of the clones examined. several bap-negative sts lack blp <dig>  others feature blp <dig> variants which may be functional impaired because carrying mutations in one ig-like domain , suggesting that bap and blp <dig> may be interdependent. the hypothesis that bap and blp <dig> may functionally interact was reinforced by the analysis of a. junii genomes. bap and blp <dig> are absent in all a. junii strains examined but the appw strain, in which both proteins are present.

functional link of bap, blp <dig> and blp <dig> was further provided by the results of quantitative rt-pcr analyses in which the levels of the corresponding transcripts were monitored. for all, rna levels were undetectable in log-phase, high in late stationary phase .

biofilm formation in different a. baumannii strains
we thought of interest to evaluate differences in the type and extent of biofilm formation among a. baumannii strains belonging to different sts, and presenting a different combination of bap and blp <dig> proteins by clsm  analyses. the acicu  and the  <dig>  strains, assigned to international clone ii and st <dig> epidemic clonal lineage, respectively, were shown to be relatively strong biofilm producers  <cit> . both strains carry pga, csu and ompa genes shown to be involved in biofilm production. biofilms formed by the two strains have comparable heights, but different architectures . the acicu biofilm exhibited a total substratum coverage. by contrast, the  <dig> biofilm was made up by large, evenly distributed microcolonies, separated by water channels. the atcc <dig> strain also carries pga, csu and ompa genes, but lacks both blp <dig> and bap <dig>  yet, this strain formed a dense biofilm, exhibiting an uniformely surface coverage. however, microcolonies were undetectable . the heterogeneity of the biofilms formed by the analyzed strains is not surprising. the plethora of genes shown or hypothesized  <cit>  to be involved in biofilm formation in a. baumannii makes difficult evaluating the role that different bap types, and the presence/absence of blp <dig>  may play in the process. we thought therefore to address the problem by mutating, as done for the bap gene in the b307- <dig> strain  <cit> , the blp <dig> and blp <dig> genes of the aye strain. either gene was inactivated by allelic replacement  <cit> . the test strain encodes a sequence-proved intact bap, comparable in length and composition to the b307- <dig> protein . bap and blp <dig> expressed by the aye and b307- <dig> strains, which both belong to sequence type  <dig>  are functionally comparable, because unaffected by size changes which may influence their exposure on cell surface, as proved for repetitive s. aureus sdr proteins of different lengths  <cit> . the biofilms formed on glass by aye and its blp <dig> deletion derivative aye-Δblp <dig> markedly differed. aye formed a typical biofilm structure , in which distinct microcolonies could be distinguished. in contrast, aye-Δblp <dig> formed just a thin monolayer. the width of the bioflm formed by aye averaged  <dig> microns. the biofilm formed by the mutant  was barely measurable . inactivation of blp <dig> also affected biofilm formation . the aye-Δblp <dig> mutant produced a biofilm only twice thinner than aye. however, in contrast to the aye-Δblp <dig> biofilm, the coverage was reduced, and microcolonies could not be detected. quantitative estimates obtained using the imaris v <dig>  software  allowed measuring the total biomass of biofilms as micrometers <dig>  <cit> . quantitative estimates of the biofilms formed by aye, aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  a significant correlation was found between biofilm biomass and biofilm thickness of aye and aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> mutant strains .fig.  <dig> clsm analysis of biofilms formed by the a. baumannii strains acicu ,  <dig> , and atcc <dig> . in each panel, to the left is shown the orthogonal view of z-stacks, to the right the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the biofilm. arrows denote biofilm heights. bright and dark areas show cell clusters and voids in the biofilm

adherence of a. baumannii wild type aye and aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> mutant strains to a <dig> human bronchial cells
we next investigated the ability of aye, aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> strains to adhere to a <dig> human alveolar epithelial cells. as shown in fig.  <dig>  aye showed a statistically significant higher adherence to a <dig> human bronchial cells compared with aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> mutant strains, which showed a reduction in adherence by  <dig> - and  <dig>  fold, respectively. moreover, significant correlations were found between adhesiveness to epithelial cells and biofilm biomass  and bacterial adhesiveness to epithelial cells and biofilm thickness  for aye, as for aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> mutants. on the other hand, aye and mutant strains were not able to invade a <dig> cells human alveolar cells . also, a similar number of bacteria adhered to a <dig> cells when the monolayers were incubated with a. baumannii strains for 60 min at 4 °c, i.e. under conditions that do not allow for tissue invasion .fig.  <dig> bacterial adherence of a. baumannii aye, aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> strains to a <dig> bronchial epithelial cells. cell surface-associated bacteria after 60 min incubation at 37 °c. asterisks denote statistically significant  differences in the degree of cell adhesion of aye and derivative clones



variable assortment of other surface proteins
we checked next whether the distribution of other surface proteins may similarly vary among a. baumannii strains. ompa, the abundant  <dig> aa protein involved in biofilm formation  <cit>  is highly conserved  in most isolates. in  <dig> clones, however, a protein variant exhibiting only 70 % identity at the nh <dig> side  was detected . interestingly, all these clones but one potentially expressed a type- <dig> bap. surp- <dig>  is a  <dig> aa protein with a central region made by 84– <dig> aa repeats  unrelated to either bap or blp <dig>  surp- <dig> has been found only in 65 % of the st. the protein is missing in all sts featuring type- <dig> bap, except st  <dig>  50 % of bap-negative sts, most of the bap-plus/blp1-negative sts. the distribution of ompa and surp- <dig> among the various sts is summarized in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
most bacterial species form biofilms, and the identification of the genetic determinants controlling this complex process became an active field of research in recent years, given the implications that biofilm formation has in medical care. as in other pathogens, a large protein expressed at the a. baumannii cell surface, known as biofilm-associated protein or bap, has a role in biofilm formation as in host cell adherence  <cit> . comparative genome analyses carried out over hundreds of sequenced strains revealed that the a. baumannii bap is highly polymorphic. the central repetitive region has a variegated structure, and type and number of repeat modules both vary among isolates. this region connects a relatively small nh <dig> domain, conserved in all baps which is plausibly exposed on the cell surface and involved in binding, to large cooh regions in turn hosting a few, additional repeats. bap cooh regions also vary, and three main types of proteins could be distinguished. type  <dig> and type  <dig> proteins are expressed by strains of the predominant clonal complexes  <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively, and have been identified also in a. calcoaceticus, a. pittii and a. nosocomialis, which form with a. baumannii the monophyletic acb complex  <cit> . type  <dig> baps feature short repetitive regions, which include novel repeat modules, and a cooh region exhibiting only 40 % similarity to the corresponding regions of either type- <dig> or type- <dig> baps. this protein variant seems restricted to a. baumannii. however, taking into the account that the variant had been identified only in 13/ <dig> sts, and a relatively small number of non-baumannii acinetobacter strains had been sequenced, it cannot be ruled out that type  <dig> bap may be expressed also by other species of the acb complex.

the genus acinetobacter hosts a variety of bap proteins, all featuring large central repetitive regions made either by 80– <dig> aa long ig-like repeats , or homopolymeric stretches of alternating serine and aspartic acid, or serine and alanine residue containing up to  <dig> dipeptides . repetitive regions in both alpha- and beta-type baps span the cell-wall allowing exposure of the n-terminal region to the environment  <cit> . the length of the repeat region has been shown to influence exposure of the s. aureus sdr proteins on cell surface  <cit> , and the same may plausibly hold true for alpha-baps. in alpha-like baps found in other species, the repeat region originated by the expansion of a single module . the rule is subverted in a. baumannii baps, which feature multiple repeats varying in length, composition and relative arrangement. a variegated repetitive region may be beneficial for such a large protein, which is a gain of specific isolates in many species, because encoded by mobile dna, but is in contrast a conserved gene product in a. baumannii. modules diversification should decrease the chance that the protein may vary in size because of strand slippage during dna replication. moreover, a low sequence identity between modules strongly inhibits misfolding and aggregation of repetitive proteins, and consecutive homologous domains in large multi-domain proteins almost exclusively show sequence identities of less than 40 %  <cit> .

as shown in this report, differences in size and extent of module variation among a. baumannnii baps both remain largely unknown. the number of isolates in which the bap gene is functional, or had been inactivated by mutations within the repetitive region, as reported for different genomes , remains also to be established, and the issue may be settled for individual strains only by expression analyses. mapping repetitive dna regions is a major bias in whole sequencing projects. reconstructing the organization of the baroque bap repetitive region is a tremendous, pitfall-rich task, and most of the sequence data on a. baumannnii bap could be wrong, and need to be amended. translation of the bap gene rna is interrupted at residue  <dig> of the protein in a high number of st <dig> clones, but a − <dig> frameshifting could let translation extending into downstream bap coding sequences. while the occurrence of both short and long bap isoforms in these clones may be experimentally tested, data denote variation in the state of the bap gene among strains of the same st. in many isolates, the bap is truncated, or absent. altogether, the fraction of bap-negative isolates belonging to different sts is elevated . thus, the bap gene may be catalogued as a variable dispensable gene.

in a. baumannii, two additional proteins, blp <dig> and blp <dig>  include a central repetitive region made by ig-like repeats. bap, blp <dig> and blp <dig> share a large sequence motif at the nh <dig> terminus, are co-expressed at the end of the stationary growth phase, and may work in conjunction. blp <dig> is a large  protein which features a composite repetitive region, and can be typed, as bap, into main sequence variants according to aa changes in the cooh region. blp <dig> has been found in a. baumannii, a. calcoaceticus and a. pittii. in several a. baumannii isolates, the blp <dig> coding region is missing, and is invariably replaced by the same piece of dna which is highly homologous to dna tracts found, at the same relative chromosome position, in a. nosocomialis and other acinetobacter blp1-negative species. the coexistence of empty and filled blp <dig> sites in the population implies recombination of a. baumannii with non-baumannii acinetobacter cells. the genetic exchange plausibly occurred once, and the empty site status had been eventually maintained, probably because the absence of blp <dig> turned out to be advantageous in specific genetic milieu. the hypothesis stems from the uneven distribution of blp <dig>  conserved in most isolates expressing type- <dig> bap, but only in half of those expressing type- <dig> bap, missing in isolates expressing type- <dig> bap. blp <dig> is also missing in most bap-negative isolates. altogether, data suggest that bap and blp <dig> may be interdependent. the proteins may interact and/or share a partner on the cell surface, and the combination of blp <dig> with different bap types may be beneficial or harmful. blp <dig> is a smaller  protein with a repetitive region made by only  <dig> ig-like repeats. the protein, found in all the species of the acb complex, is highly conserved in a. baumannii. blp <dig> may also be a component of surface protein complexes involved in biofilm formation. the conclusion stems from the observation that bap-negative strains belonging to different sts lack blp <dig>  or feature blp <dig> with mutated ig-like domains. moreover, bap and blp <dig> are both absent or present in all a. junii strains examined.

a link between bap and blps is suggested by the observation that gene disruption of either blp gene impaired biofilm formation, as proved by sclm analyses . similarly to bap, the blp1- and blp2-negative derivatives aye-Δblp <dig> and aye-Δblp <dig> also showed a reduced adherence to human epithelial cells . other surface proteins, known or hypothesized to be involved in biofilm formation, may interact and/or be assembled with bap and blps on the cell surface. ompa has a role in biofilm formation  <cit>  and is highly conserved in the a. baumannii population. interestingly, the protein varies significantly in sequence composition in most clones expressing type- <dig> bap. surp- <dig>  a repetitive protein structurally related to bap and blps, is missing in most type- <dig> bap, as in many blp1-negative clones. the uneven distribution of the various bap types, ompa variants, blp <dig> and surp- <dig> proteins among isolates is indicative of alternative combinations of surface proteins in the a. baumannii population. consequently, the architecture of the biofilm formed by different isolates may greatly vary.

CONCLUSIONS
the construction of clones expressing bap and blps isoforms in all possible combinations is important to clarify the role played by each protein in biofilm formation of a. baumannii, establish whether the proteins interact, assess underneath hierarchies. in parallel, mutational analyses may shed light on the functional organization of the repetitive regions of baps and blps, and establish how the combination of specific modules may influence secretion and surface exposure of each protein.

the assay of type- <dig> bap derivatives may be crucial to assess whether the unicity of this protein, which seems mutually exclusive relative to other surface components, correlates with the particular combination of ig-like modules in the repetitive region and/or their paucity, or resides in the cooh region.
