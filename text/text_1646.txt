BACKGROUND
numerous mechanisms have evolved to cope with early-developmental nutrient stress . the fine-tuning of physiological systems is driven by an gentic response towards environmental cues, a process known as developmental plasticity .

the outcomes of developmental plasticity affect post-developmental health  <cit> . in vertebrate systems, nutrient restriction during development has been linked to traits in adult life  <cit> . complications range from fetal growth restriction  and small-for-gestational age  phenotypes  to obesity, type  <dig> diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. a combination of these symptoms is known as the metabolic syndrome . in humans, the risk to develop metabolic diseases later in life is most prominent if nutrient restriction occurs during early gestation, even when it resolves during later stages  <cit> .

developmental plasticity triggered by nutrient depletion during development would cause changes in embryonic gene expression, which may contribute to the phenotypes observed in adulthood. here, we test this hypothesis experimentally by partially depleting zebrafish embryos from yolk at an early developmental stage. we analyze changes in gene expression at multiple time points after yolk depletion using rna sequencing and microarrays. we find that partial yolk-depletion  leads to subtle changes in gene expression that are statistically significant, thereby affecting expression changes of metabolic genes and hormonal signaling. by scoring the number of abstracts in which genes and diseases are both mentioned  we find that deregulated genes associate to the metabolic syndrome. therefore, the response shows similarities to the impact of developmental malnutrition in humans. notably, deregulated methionine cycle genes indicate altered methyl donor availability. according to a comparably low amount of cpg sites around the transcription start site  of deregulated genes, regulation of these genes may be relatively insensitive to methyl donor availability. the overall response indicates that the developing zebrafish embryo responds to nutrient depletion by subtle fine-tuning of its metabolic pathways.

RESULTS
nutrient depletion during embryogenesis does not affect viability, but induces a bias towards female development
the study design is depicted in fig. 1a. we removed yolk shortly after yolk-syncytial layer  formation, between 4– <dig> hpf. at  <dig> hpf, maternally deposited transcripts in yolk are expected to be reduced, as the yolk passage of maternal transcripts towards the embryo along ooplasmic streaming is completed around the  <dig> cell stage  <cit> . also, maternal transcripts enriched in extra-embryonic tissue around  <dig> hpf localize to the extra-embryonic ysl  <cit> , not to yolk. the ysl accommodates nutrient transport to the zebrafish embryo starting from 3 h post fertilization   <cit> . representative pictures of embryos show yolk depleted  embryos and sham-punctured  controls . yd treatment did not affect survival: after removing 25 % of yolk content, the one-week survival was 92 % , compared to 92 %  in sp controls . the survival outcome is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . also, embryo handling did not cause an early developmental delay in yd and sp embryos. at least until 9 h after treatment , somatogenesis was unaffected . we therefore exclude that differences in gene transcription between yd and sp embryos are due to lethality or developmental delay.fig.  <dig> study design, developmental outcome and differential expression datasets of yd vs. sp embryos. a study design. transcriptome profiles were generated at  <dig> time-points until  <dig> hpf. the images represent yd and sp embryos at the given time points. yd embryos show a reduced yolk volume  and size. b survival of yd  and sp embryos during one week post-fertilization in yd  and sp  embryos during 7 days after treatment is >90 % in each group. c average somite number from  <dig> hpf to  <dig> hpf in yd  and sp embryos. d gender of adult fish, number of fish per treatment noted inside bars. a paired t-test for the three batches shows a significant increase in females. e box-plot of differential expression  levels at each time-point for genes that were significantly differentially expressed . f number of de genes obtained at each time-point. sp: down-regulated in yd; yd: up-regulated in yd; all: all genes which passes expression level threshold and were included in this study ; ens: genes from microarray data with ensembl identifier. union indicates union of genes with ensembl identifier



both sp and yd embryos developed into healthy adult fish. in zebrafish, female development is induced when food availability, or growth rate, during early adulthood is increased  <cit> . we observed a higher number of females in adult yd fish . this was observed in fish raised in batches and fish raised individually, in tanks that were placed in alternating order to control for location and feeding-induced biases. combined, the gender differences in two batches and individually raised fish leads to a statistically significant outcome in a paired 2-sided t-test . we hypothesize that a higher number of females among yd adult fish could be indicative for increased food consumption or caloric storage up to early adulthood. potentially, this could resemble the early onset of metabolic syndrome in humans: in humans, a high caloric intake and storage before adulthood increases the risk to develop the metabolic syndrome  <cit> .

yd induces subtle expression changes in embryogenesis
to study the effect of nutrient depletion on gene expression, we obtained transcriptome profiles at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpf by rnaseq and  <dig> hpf by microarray hybridization, each time point in triplicate . despite platform-dependent biases, relative, not absolute, expression values obtained by rnaseq and microarray hybridization correlate well  <cit> . differentially expressed  genes could therefore be compared across all  <dig> time-points. generally, de was less than 2-fold, except for de genes up-regulated in yd embryos at  <dig> hpf . we detected over a hundred de genes at each time-point. the number of genes that passed threshold expression levels ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . we verified differential expression by quantitative real-time pcr . this analysis confirmed deregulation for  <dig> out of  <dig> tested genes . qrt pcr vs. rnaseq or microarray values correlated well, with a spearman correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . rnaseq and microarray samples showed an overall high correlation between identical time-points .

transcriptional response to nutrient depletion involves metabolic genes
to uncover the pathways common to deregulated genes we performed functional enrichment analysis for the  <dig> time-points separately. we identified  <dig> unique molecular function gene-ontology  terms  <cit>  significantly enriched at least at one time-point . as a score for the enrichment of mfgo terms over all  <dig> time-points combined, the product of p-values was calculated. among the  <dig> lowest p-value products we found lipid transport, oxidative processes and hormone activity. these classes of genes are closely associated with core metabolism and are likely to be deregulated in a cellular response that aims to compensate for the lack of nutrients. we also looked into the functions of genes that were deregulated at least at  <dig> time-points. we discuss the significance of these classes and details on deregulated genes below.

apolipoprotein genes and other lipid-transporters are deregulated
at  <dig> hpf, we identified  <dig> deregulated lipid-transport genes,  <dig> of which are apolipoprotein  genes. at  <dig> hpf, we identified  <dig> lipid-transport genes,  <dig> of which are apo genes . based on hypergeometric testing using the  <dig> known apo genes in zebrafish , the elevated number of apo genes at  <dig> hpf as well as at  <dig> hpf is significant . deregulated lipid-transport genes are up-regulated in yd embryos at  <dig> hpf and down-regulated in yd at  <dig> hpf, except for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein , which is down-regulated in yd embryos both at  <dig> hpf as well as  <dig> hpf. yolk has a high lipid content  <cit> . we propose that lipid transporters respond dynamically to reduction in lipid availability due to a reduced yolk content.fig.  <dig> stage-specific changes in gene expression and functional annotation. a genes that are involved in lipid transport are dynamically de between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf. four genes  overlap with these two time-points. the enrichment of apo genes at each of these two time-points is significant . b de gene symbols that overlap three time-points, which is the largest overlap observed in this study



hypoxia signaling is activated
oxidative processes were notably enriched among deregulated genes. the observed down-regulation in yd embryos of egln <dig> and egln <dig>   <cit>  and also known as phd <dig> and phd <dig>  <cit> ) at  <dig> hpf and 24/ <dig> hpf respectively, complies with hypoxia signaling in yd embryos . egln <dig> down-regulation in yd embryos is reminiscent with down-regulation of its human orthologue in placenta from fetal growth restricted  children  <cit> . hypoxia signaling has also been observed in fetal murine hearts and brains from undernourished mothers  <cit>  and is consistent with pronounced oxidative stress in small-for-gestational age  newborns from undernourished mothers  <cit> . potentially, oxidative processes in yd embryos relate to a modified metabolic demand during development. for instance, beside its roles in hypoxia signaling, egln <dig>  has been implicated in lipid and glucose metabolism  <cit> .

enhanced glucose dependence in yd embryos
seven de genes in our dataset are de at three time-points , of which  <dig> relate directly to glucose. firstly, glucose-6-phosphatase a, catalytic, tandem duplicate  <dig> is up-regulated in yd at  <dig> hpf and down-regulated in yd at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf. glucose-6-phosphatases hydrolyze phosphate from glucose-6-phosphates, thereby releasing glucose, which completes gluconeogenesis. second, pfkfb4l belongs to a class of genes that encode bi-functional enzymes that either stimulate gluconeogenesis or glycolysis; under hypoxic conditions in cell systems, it is up-regulated and expected to stimulate glycolysis  <cit> . this gene is up-regulated in yd at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpf. the disturbed glucose metabolism is furthermore exemplified by the up-regulation of txnipa in yd embryos from  <dig> hpf onwards, and txnipb at  <dig> hpf . in mammalian systems, up-regulation of txnip in beta-cells reduces insulin levels and induces apoptosis, which leads to diabetes  <cit> . based on the deregulation of these  <dig> genes as well as the oxidative signaling in yd embryos, it is expected that gluconeogenesis is down-regulated and glycolysis is up-regulated in yd embryos from  <dig> hpf onwards.

hormonal responses at  <dig> hpf
at  <dig> hpf, hormone activity was the most highly ranked mfgo term . together with the enriched term “cytokine activity”, this strongly points out a systemic response at  <dig> hpf. one of these hormones, i.e. gonadotropin-releasing hormone  <dig> , was induced in the yd embryos . this hormone, which is conserved from fish to humans, but has been lost in rodents, negatively regulates feeding behavior in the zebrafish and other systems after intracerebroventricular injection  <cit> . gnrh <dig> is an anorexic hormone, and potentially its up-regulation may reflect a reduced yolk consumption at  <dig> hpf yd embryos. among genes with an mfgo term related to hormonal regulation, we furthermore found hormones involved in growth and metabolism, such as somatostatin  <dig>  stanniocalcin, parathyroid hormone 1a , glycoprotein hormones alpha polypeptide and somatolactin beta.fig.  <dig> molecular function gene ontology  and co-citation enrichments. a molecular function go enrichment. from left to right: semantic transcript name, enriched mfgo terms , barplot of log <dig> transformed de of all significant transcripts. the position of the transcript names are aligned with the corresponding bars on the barplot, to indicate their rank among de genes. only transcript names linked to enriched mfgo terms are denoted. error bars denote standard deviations. asterisks show entrez gene ids for which no semantic name is available. b cociter counts for given terms and entrez ids from de genes at all time points, divided by the number of included genes . asterisks denote significant enrichment of combined terms . c enrichment analysis of combined terms from  for significantly expressed genes in this study  and  <dig> collections of  <dig> randomly picked identifiers from the input . the dashed line marks p =  <dig> 



de genes associate to the metabolic syndrome
co-citation enrichments are useful to reveal associations between large gene sets and diseases. we applied the cociter tool  <cit>  to look for associations between de genes and “hypertension”, “obesity”, “type  <dig> diabetes” and “osteoporosis”, i.e. metabolic diseases of which the susceptibility is increased after early-life malnutrition in mammalian systems  <cit> . required entrez gene identifiers were obtained for 300/ <dig> de genes at  <dig> hpf, 113/ <dig> de genes at  <dig> hpf, 221/ <dig> de genes at  <dig> hpf and 132/ <dig> de genes at  <dig> hpf. gene vs. term enrichments where found at  <dig> hpf ,  <dig> hpf  and  <dig> hpf , but not at  <dig> hpf . this outcome seems specific to de genes: we repeated cociter analysis for  <dig> sets of  <dig> randomly sampled names in our  <dig> hpf dataset ) and none of these samplings resulted in a significant outcome . co-citation with metabolic diseases points out that the transcriptional response in yd embryos likely associates to the disease outcome of developmental nutrient restrictions.

the methionine cycle is affected throughout development
the methionine cycle produces methyl donors for methylation of nucleic acids, as well as proteins. upstream of this cycle, methyl groups enter the methionine cycle via folic acid, betaine and other metabolites  <cit> . differential dna methylation has been implicated in developmental outcomes of early-life nutrient restriction  <cit> .

in the methionine cycle, in total  <dig> enzymes  are de :fig.  <dig> the methionine cycle is involved in the response to yd and its involvement is conserved. a schematic representation of the methionine cycle. gene symbols are followed by information about temporal de. “y” indicates up-regulation in yd; “s” indicates down-regulation in yd; a dash  indicates no de. from left to right:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> hpf. see example in top left corner. colors highlight whether genes are up-regulated in yd only , down-regulated in yd only  or up- and down regulated at different time-points . *two different de mat genes are identified: mat1a at  <dig> hpf and mat2ab at  <dig> hpf. **trdmt <dig> is the only de dnmt homologue in this study. since it is a rna methyl transferase, for clarity, only rna is depicted as a substrate for methylation. ***four de creatine kinase genes are combined in this schematic figure. b de levels of de genes from , with identical color scheme. c de of three genes confirmed by qrt pcr, rna obtained from pooled embryos. d de of mat2ab confirmed by qrt pcr, rna obtained from individual embryos. e de of bhmt in response to yd treatment , nacl exposure and heatshock, data obtained from qrt pcr. values shown are cp  – cp, normalized against cp.
f methionine cycle genes that overlap with de genes  and identical-sized random samples from all genes in this study . g seven out of  <dig> de genes homologues that correspond to methionine cycle genes from this study overlap to de genes in the liver of maternally starved fetal mice . open bars show the overlap with methionine cycle genes and  <dig> randomly sampled genes from the complete mouse liver gene set. asterisks denote significant p-values according to the student’s t-test in  and . in  and , the p-value represents the fraction of randomly sampled overlaps that is equal to or larger than the overlap with de genes after  <dig> permutations

at  <dig> hpf, bhmt, mat1a, gatm and gamt are up-regulated in yd;

at  <dig> hpf, dmgdh is down-regulated in yd;

at  <dig> hpf, trdmt <dig> is up-regulated in yd and bhmt, sardh, gnmt are down-regulated in yd; and

at  <dig> hpf, mat2ab is up-regulated in yd.



downstream enzymes, such as creatine kinases, are deregulated as well. we sampled  <dig> genes from this pathway  and validated their de by qrt pcr .

to investigate whether the methionine cycle deregulation could be part of a general stress response, we measured expression levels of bhmt under two additional types of perturbation at  <dig>  hpf by qrt pcr: 1) exposure to 10 mm nacl and 2) exposure to  <dig> c heatshock for 30 min. we harvested the embryos to measure gene expression at  <dig> hpf. at  <dig> hpf, after heatshock, survival dropped to 42 %, whereas in the other groups survival exceeded 95 %. bhmt is significantly differentially expressed in all treatments. however, while this gene is down-regulated after yd treatment compared to sp, it is up-regulated after nacl and heatshock treatments compared to non-exposed controls . bhmt is differentially expressed in two directions, both temporally after yd treatment and in response to different perturbations. we suggest that the dynamic response of the methionine cycle alters the availability of methyl donors, glutathione and creatine. this may affect methylation, oxidation and cellular energy availability, respectively, even though expression level differences are significant but small.

the overlap of de genes with methionine cycle genes is significantly large  . our original set of de genes overlaps with  <dig> genes in the methionine cycle, creatine kinases not considered. we replaced the original sets of de genes with randomly sampled gene identifiers from all de and non-de genes and intersected these with methionine cycle enzymes. the maximum overlap was  <dig> genes after  <dig> permutations. we included all known methyltransferases, and excluded creatine kinases .

the involvement of the methionine cycle may furthermore be evolutionary conserved. we observed an enrichment of de methionine cycle genes in fetal livers of male c57bl/6 j mice at gestational day  <dig>  of which the mothers had been exposed to 50 % food restriction . seven out of  <dig> homologues of de genes from fig. 4a and b are differentially expressed in these mouse livers, which is significantly more than randomly selected groups of  <dig> genes .

taken together, the genes in the methionine cycle dynamically respond to yd treatment and other types of perturbations. the involvement of the methionine cycle is likely conserved from fish to mammals. at present, we do not have direct evidence whether the state of the methionine cycle in yd leads to differential dna methylation. we have not identified dna methyltransferases among de genes. the only de methyl transferase in our data is trdmt <dig>  which is an rna methyltransferase. it methylates asp-trna  <cit>  and has been linked to phenotypic, non-mendelian inheritance, whereby it possibly affects mrna methylation  <cit> . possibly, the response to yd treatment involves differential methylation of selected genes , rna, or other substrates.

potential avoidance of perturbations in methylation capacity
cpg sites around the transcription start site  are targets of dna methyl transferases: the methylation of cytosine residues represses transcription  <cit> . in our dataset, we find sets of time-point specific deregulated genes with significantly reduced numbers of cpg sites around their tss, compared to a genome-wide background: at  <dig> hpf, in yd embryos, genes that are up-regulated show a reduced cpg content . at  <dig> hpf, down-regulated genes in yd embryos show a reduced cpg content . a reduced cpg content in deregulated genes could indicate that cpg sites around the tss of responsive genes are under negative selection and that these genes avoid transcriptional regulation by dna methylation. responsive genes may therefore be less sensitive for methylation perturbations and/or methylation may not be the dominant transcriptional regulator of these genes.fig.  <dig> cpg density is reduced in genes that are deregulated. the empirical cumulative distribution  of the number of cpg sites in all genes  projected onto the number of cpg sites in de genes. a left panel: at  <dig> hpf, the kolmogorov-smirnov test reveals a significant reduction of cpg sites in promotor regions of de genes that are up-regulated in yd . right panel: this depletion is most prominent around 5′ of the gene, including the proximal part of the cds. five-hundred nt windows of the unspliced gene  and cds  are shown. b as in . at  <dig> hpf, a significant reduction of cpg sites in promotor regions and around the tss is observed in de genes that are down-regulated in yd. yd: up-regulated in yd; sp: down-regulated in yd; all: all available ensembl-annotated genes



CONCLUSIONS
yd treatment in zebrafish embryos dynamically affects the expression of metabolic genes, hormones and genes of the methionine cycle. although expression differences between yd and sp embryos are subtle, the responding genes are part of a diverse set of functional pathways. together, these pathways likely contribute to developmental plasticity after yd treatment.

through the deregulated methionine cycle we find a possible role for methylation pathways in the response towards reduced nutrient availability. functional approaches are required to obtain mechanistic insights in the temporally dynamic response of the methionine cycle and its downstream targets. we found the co-citation of metabolic traits and deregulated genes is significant. also, the higher number of females after yd treatment may reflect a differential food consumption or growth rate between embryogenesis and early adulthood  <cit>  which in humans could potentially increase the risk to develop metabolic disease  <cit> . taken together there are strong similarities between the developmental outcome of yd treatment and the outcome of mammalian developmental nutrient restriction and fgr. in conclusion, our model revealed a dynamic transcriptional landscape after early-developmental nutrient reduction. this was identified by transcriptome profiling at various time-points. the zebrafish system we established here can help to elucidate the response to reduced nutrient availability during developmental stages and may serve as a model to study its physiological consequences.
