BACKGROUND
locoweeds are a general term for toxic plants of the genera astragalus and oxytropis, and are one of the toxic plants causing the most damage to husbandry in the grassland across the world. they possess wider geographical distribution from the great plains to the rocky mountains, and they are worldwide spread, such as in the united states  <cit> , australia  <cit> , mexico  <cit> , brazil  <cit> , and china  <cit> . oxytropis kansuensis, one of the locoweeds from the genus oxytropis, is found in qinghai, gansu, ningxia, sichuan, northwestern yunnan, and paramos regions in tibet  <cit> . because of its luxuriant leaves, wide-spread roots and strong stress resistance, huge numbers of livestock get poisoned and even die in grassland containing oxytropis kansuensis every year, causing huge losses to local herdsmen and typical ecological-economic disease  <cit> . poisoned animals show clinical signs characterized by nerve functional disturbance symptoms like depression, diminished response, ataxia, abnormal behavior, emaciation and decline in immune function  <cit> .

the main toxic ingredient in locoweeds is swainsonine   <cit> , an indolizidine alkaloid whose chemical name is  <dig>   <dig>  8- trihydroxy-indolizidine alkaloid . sw was first isolated from swainsona canescen by colegate et al.  <cit> ; since then, large amounts of researches has focused on the bioactivity of sw, finding that the structure of sw is similar to the mannose cation formed by the hydrolysis of mannosidase. sw has high affinity to α-mannosidase and, as a result, can inhibit the enzyme. this inhibition induces abnormal of glycoprotein processing and cellular vacuolation  <cit> , especially in nerve cells that is caused by the accumulation of oligosaccharides in the lysosome  <cit> .

apoptosis is a tightly controlled physiological process that plays a critical role in developmental modeling, homeostasis maintenance, immune repertoires, and clearance of infected or transformed cells  <cit> . apoptosis can be triggered by various extracellular and intracellular stimuli via either an extrinsic or intrinsic pathway in different cells  <cit> . the extrinsic pathway is initiated by cell surface receptors, while the intrinsic pathway is initiated by a mitochondria mediated death signaling cascade  <cit> . to date, sw has been reported to induce the apoptosis of the gastric cancer cell sgc- <dig>  c <dig> glioma cells, human lung cancer cell a <dig>  etc. some studies have been conducted examining the apoptosis pathway induced by sw in a <dig> cells  <cit> . however, the mechanism sw-mediated neurotoxicity has not been rigorously explored, and apoptosis in the brain induced by sw and its associated pathways have yet to be discovered. thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of sw on the expression of fas, fasl, bcl- <dig>  bax and cleaved caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in the brains of sd rats and to determine which apoptosis pathway is induced by sw. these results will inform future research on the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of o. kansuensis as well as other locoweeds.

RESULTS
o. kansuensis activates caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and -3
to gain insight into the underlying mechanism of o. kansuensis-induced apoptosis, we measured the activation of caspases in the brain cells of these rats. protein levels of caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were measured by western blot. upon o. kansuensis treatment, cleaved caspase- <dig>  cleaved caspase- <dig> and cleaved caspase- <dig> levels increased with increased toxic doses, cleaved caspase- <dig> and cleaved caspase- <dig> showed a dosed-dependent increase . these data suggest that both death receptor pathway and mitochondrial pathways may contribute to caspase- <dig> activation in o. kansuensis-induced apoptosis.

o. kansuensis induces apoptosis through the fas/fasl-dependent pathway
caspase- <dig> is the initiator caspase for the caspase cascades activated by death receptor pathways  <cit> . the activation of caspase- <dig> suggested that fas and fasl may be involved in o. kansuensis-induced apoptosis. therefore, we investigated the expression of fas and fasl in the brain cells of sd rats treated with o. kansuensis. as shown in figure  <dig>  the protein levels of fas and fasl were increased in a dose-dependent manner.

o. kansuensis regulates the expression of bcl- <dig> family proteins
the expression of bcl- <dig> and bax were detected by western blot. protein levels of bax were up-regulated, while, conversely, the protein levels of bcl- <dig> were significantly decreased . as shown in figure 4b, o. kansuensis resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the ratio of bax/bcl- <dig>  these results suggested that bax up-regulation and bcl- <dig> down-regulation may play important roles in o. kansuensis-induced apoptosis of brain cells in sd rats.

discussion
the indolizidin alkaloid sw is present in o. kansuensis, and has been shown to have neurotoxic effects. previous studies have reported that the poisoning of livestock by locoweeds caused neurons in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, mid-brain, hippocampus, cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord to undergo cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration  <cit> . colodel et al. reported that swainsona, oxytropis, astragalus, and ipomoea poisonings caused multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles in acinar pancreatic cells, hepatocytes, and renal tubular cells, especially in neurons, and led to lesions of the central nervous system  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of o. kansuensis-induced apoptosis of brain cells in sd rats. these data demonstrated that sw induced apoptosis in the cerebrum via the fas/fasl and mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways.

many previous reports have indicated that numerous neurogenic diseases were related to the apoptosis of neurons  <cit> . sun et al. reported that sw could induce sgc- <dig> cell apoptosis by inhibiting the gene p <dig> and decreasing the expression of bcl- <dig>  increasing the apoptotic trigger gene c-myc and loading i <cit> ; they subsequently demonstrated that the mechanisms of sw-induced apoptosis may be related to the expression of apoptosis-related genes and overloading-i-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress  <cit> . li et al. reported that sw treatment up-regulated bax, down-regulated bcl- <dig> expression, increased the rate of bax/bcl- <dig>  and activated the mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in vitro and in vivo. a <dig> cells apoptosis occurred in a concentration- and time-dependent manner  <cit> .

apoptosis programs a cell to actively commit suicide as the results of activation of dedicated intracellular program; the death receptors  and mitochondrial  pathways are the major signaling cascades that lead to apoptosis. the death receptor pathway involves death receptors from the tumor necrosis factor receptor family such as fas , tnfαr, dr <dig>  dr <dig> and dr <dig>  in the death receptors pathway, ligands of the death receptor initiate signaling via receptor oligomerization, which results in the recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and the activation of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . the mitochondrial pathway is dependent on the formation of lipidic pores, which significantly affected the release of cytochrome c from the inner membrane of the mitochondria to the cytosol. holocytochrome c induces apaf- <dig> oligomerization, leading to the activation of caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig> and - <dig> are both initiator caspases and activate downstream effector caspases that are essential for the direct demolition of cellular structures and dna fragmentation associated with apoptosis  <cit> .

caspases involved in apoptosis can be divided into two functional subgroups based on their roles. initiators  are responsible for initiating the activation of caspase cascades for different apoptotic pathways. effector caspases  are responsible for demolition of the cell during apoptosis  <cit> . in this study, we observed that sw-induced apoptosis activated caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  which suggested that the death receptor-mediated caspase- <dig> pathway and the mitochondrial-mediated caspase- <dig> pathway may be responsible for sw-induced apoptosis.

fas is one of the death receptors; binding of fasl induces fas trimerization, which recruits caspase- <dig> via the adaptor protein fas-associated death domain protein . then, caspase- <dig> oligomerizes and is activated through autocatalysis. activated caspase- <dig> triggers the execution phase of apoptosis via the activation of the downstream effector caspase- <dig>  <cit> . this study revealed that the sw-induced apoptosis resulted in increased expression of fas and fasl, followed by activation of caspase- <dig> and - <dig>  these data demonstrated that caspase- <dig> activation in sw-induced apoptosis can be mediated by fas/fasl interaction.

cytochrome c is one of a host of pro-death molecules residing within mitochondria and is a universal feature of apoptosis. previous studies have demonstrated that the bcl- <dig> family is intimately involved in the regulation of cytochrome c release into the cytosol  <cit> . bcl- <dig> family proteins include both pro- and anti-apoptotic members. the pro-apoptotic homolog bax is located in the cytosol, and it can interact with the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  in response to apoptotic signals, bax translocates to the mitochondria and inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane, heterodimerizing with bcl- <dig> to abrogate bcl-2’s inhibition of apoptosis by promoting the release of cytochrome c into cytosol  <cit> . therefore, the ratio of bax/bcl- <dig> sets the threshold of susceptibility to apoptosis for the mitochondrial pathway  <cit> . our results showed that sw treatment up-regulated bax and down-regulated bcl- <dig> expression, increasing the ratio of bax/bcl- <dig> which likely resulted in brain cell apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that sw induces apoptosis through the activation of fas/fasl-mediated caspase- <dig> and mitochondria-dependent caspase- <dig> pathways. these data provided a new foundation to further explore the underlying mechanisms of o. kansuensis-induced apoptosis. based on these findings, a schematic model of possible sw-induced apoptotic mechanisms in brain cells is shown in figure  <dig>  however, it is probable that we are far from unraveling the complete mechanisms of sw-induced apoptosis, with mechanisms involving p <dig>  aif, smac/diablo, and endoplasmic reticulum stress potentially playing a significant role.
