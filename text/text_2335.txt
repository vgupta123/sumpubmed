BACKGROUND
kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  and epstein-barr virus  are related gamma-herpesviruses that cause a variety of human b cell and non-b cell malignancies. ebv was identified in  <dig> as the etiological agent of burkitt's lymphoma   <cit> , and is detected in the majority of african endemic bl  <cit> . kshv was identified in  <dig> as the etiological agent of kaposi's sarcoma  <cit> , and later detected in all cases of primary effusion lymphoma   <cit> . in a unique example of co-infection, 60-90% of pel cases carry ebv in addition to kshv . both kshv and ebv encode genes that promote proliferation, enhance survival, and inhibit host immune responses . unfortunately, the expression of these genes also contributes to viral malignancies if the host's immune system is compromised.

preliminary annotation of viral genes is typically based on sequence homology to related viruses and in silico prediction of open reading frames  typically defined by a minimum of  <dig> amino acids with a preceding start methionine  <cit> . new viral genes can also be proposed using computer-based search algorithms revealing homology to known cellular and viral genes. subsequent confirmation of preliminary annotation relies on transcript analysis, such as rapid amplification of cdna ends , northern probing, or direct sequencing. several genes encoded by kshv and ebv as well as other viruses do not conform to traditional strategies of annotation, requiring integration of multiple methods and frequently, extensive experimentation, for their detection. examples include epstein-barr virus encoded rnas  and poly-adenylated nuclear rna  which are noncoding genes  <cit> ; kaposin isoforms b and c which use non-canonical start codons  <cit> ; antisense-orf <dig> which encodes only short peptides  <cit> ; and genes with limited sequence homology to known genes, including epstein-barr nuclear antigen  <dig>   <cit>  and latency associated nuclear antigen  <dig>   <cit> .

in this study, we applied a systems biology approach to identify novel viral genes and to assess patterns of viral gene expression for ebv and kshv. we designed custom tiling arrays to interrogate viral transcriptomes and performed high-resolution, liquid chromatography  with tandem-mass spectrometry  to interrogate viral proteomes. by integrating both transcriptome and proteome data, we gained a more comprehensive assessment of viral gene expression. our strategy using human b cell lymphoma cell lines singly-infected, dually-infected, or not infected either by kshv and/or ebv provided a particularly well-controlled system for this assessment. we manipulated the pattern of viral gene expression by experimentally inducing virus lytic reactivation from latency. paired lytic and latent samples provided a comparison of the full range of viral gene expression that is theoretically detectable in a particular virus with the restricted expression of viral genes required for tumorigenesis. detection of latent genes can be obscured by a fraction of spontaneously-lytic cells in a population; thus, tightly-latent cell lines and spontaneously-lytic cell lines were compared in this study. in general, quantitative proteomic detection of viral peptides closely followed viral gene hybridization data.

we detected known, annotated viral genes from kshv  and ebv , as well as multiple viral genes that have been previously described but remain unannotated relative to their curated viral genomes. additionally, we identified several novel transcripts and proteins in both kshv and ebv, including the first detection of a novel protein corresponding to the unannotated transcript antisense to vil <dig> and orf <dig> of kshv. the alignment of the transcriptome and proteome data from pel and bl cell lines produces a more precise classification of latent genes for both viruses, allows quantification of spontaneous-lytic induction, and more importantly, facilitates virus gene discovery.

RESULTS
assessing viral transcriptomes and proteomes
tiling array experiments were performed to assess viral transcriptomes using five, untreated b cell lines, including three pels and two bls . the pel cell line bc- <dig> was additionally assessed using lytic culture conditions by treating with sodium butyrate  and 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate  for  <dig> hours. bjab, an ebv-negative/kshv-negative bl cell line, was used as the reference sample for all arrays. as a control experiment, bjab was tested in both cy <dig> and cy <dig> channels; kshv and ebv transcripts were not discernible above background fluorescence . transcript expression was evaluated using a cutoff of ≥ <dig> -fold normalized signal to eliminate false positives and minimize false negatives . using this cutoff, no kshv transcripts were detected over the reference sample in the kshv-negative cell line mutuiii , and no ebv transcripts were detected over the reference sample in the ebv-negative cell line bcbl- <dig> . select cellular genes probed as controls, e.g., gapdh, were detected in all samples above background fluorescence . the expression patterns of either kshv or ebv transcriptomes were compared pairwise for each sample using pearson's correlation coefficients; technical replicates of either latent or lytic bc- <dig> samples were very strongly correlated .

total possible ebv transcripts =  <dig> known/annotated,  <dig> novel

we also detected a set of transcripts corresponding to unannotated regions of kshv  and ebv  in multiple cell lines and conditions . in mutuiii, an ebv-positive/kshv-negative bl cell line, transcripts from  <dig> annotated genes and  <dig> novel ebv gene were detected over the reference sample. in bcbl- <dig>  a kshv-positive/ebv-negative pel cell line, transcripts from  <dig> annotated genes and  <dig> unannotated/novel kshv genes were detected over the reference sample. in jsc- <dig>  a kshv-positive/ebv-positive pel cell line, transcripts from  <dig> annotated and  <dig> unannotated/novel kshv genes were detected over the reference sample; transcripts from  <dig> annotated and  <dig> novel ebv genes were detected. in bc- <dig>  another kshv-positive/ebv-positive pel cell line, transcripts from  <dig> annotated and  <dig> unannotated/novel kshv genes were detected over the reference sample; transcripts from  <dig> annotated and  <dig> novel ebv genes were detected. additional annotated and unannotated viral transcripts were detected over the reference sample on lytic induction of bc- <dig>  with  <dig> annotated and  <dig> unannotated/novel kshv genes and  <dig> annotated and  <dig> novel ebv genes detected.

whole cell lysates were used with lc-ms/ms analysis to assess the proteomes from two pel cell lines, cultured under latent and lytic conditions . peptides that were not assigned to known cellular proteins were mapped to orfs at least  <dig> amino acids long in the 6-frames of kshv  or ebv . collectively,  <dig>  peptide spectra  were detected across all samples corresponding to  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated kshv proteins . a total of  <dig> peptide spectra were detected corresponding to  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated ebv proteins , and one additional peptide spectrum was detected corresponding to the previously-described, unannotated protein in an alternative reading frame  of ebv's ebna <dig>  <cit> . an additional set of peptides was also identified corresponding to unannotated orfs in kshv or ebv . these peptides represent putative viral proteins, but were only considered novel proteins if they fulfilled two criteria: 1) at least one peptide was detected in multiple samples, and 2) in one of these samples, two or more peptide spectra were detected. the lack of an identifiable start methionine was not an exclusionary criterion. observed spectra from unique peptide sequences were totaled together if they mapped to the same orf. altogether,  <dig> peptide spectra were identified corresponding to  <dig> novel kshv proteins, and  <dig> peptide spectra were identified corresponding to  <dig> novel ebv proteins. a large number of putative peptides did not meet both criteria .

kshv peptide spectra were detected in latent bcbl- <dig> as  <dig> % of all observed spectra  and in lytic bcbl- <dig> as  <dig> % of all observed spectra  . kshv peptide spectra were detected in latent bc- <dig> as  <dig> % of all observed spectra  and in lytic bc- <dig> as  <dig> % of all observed spectra  consistent with kshv having tight latency in bc- <dig> cells compared to bcbl- <dig> in standard culture  <cit> . ebv peptide spectra were detected in latent bc- <dig> as  <dig> % of all observed spectra  and in lytic bc- <dig> as  <dig> % of all observed spectra . detection of fewer ebv peptides than kshv peptides is consistent with more abundant expression of kshv genes than ebv genes in dually-infected pel, although this also may be due in part to differences in kshv and ebv copy number  <cit> . the number of viral peptide spectra increase upon lytic induction as expected; this increase is less pronounced for bcbl- <dig>  than for bc- <dig> .

aligning viral proteomes and transcriptomes
alignments were made between viral proteomes and viral transcriptomes to determine their degree of overlap ; alignments include any known, unannotated, or novel viral genes with a distinct match between one transcript and one protein. analysis of matched proteins-to-transcripts, relative to the total observed kshv proteins per sample, shows alignment of 50% for latent bc- <dig>  88% for lytic bc- <dig>  and 95% for latent bcbl- <dig>  a similar analysis for ebv has an alignment of 14% for latent bc- <dig> and 32% for lytic bc- <dig>  combining the list of ebv proteins detected in bc- <dig> reveals that 68% of these proteins are mature virion proteins  . in latent bc- <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> proteins from kshv without matched transcripts are also detected upon lytic induction;  <dig> of these proteins have detectable transcripts in lytic bc- <dig>  by contrast, bc- <dig> lytic and bcbl- <dig> latent samples have very few detected proteins from kshv without matched transcripts.

§transcript-to-protein alignments  were adjusted to remove non-coding rnas from the denominator.

*bcbl- <dig> latent transcripts were aligned to lytic proteins .

we do not detect any proteins for non-coding viral transcripts, such as ebers, pan, and primary micrornas , while peptides were readily detected for coding mrnas. these non-coding transcripts were removed for adjusted transcript-to-protein alignments . analysis of matched transcripts-to-proteins, relative to the total observed kshv transcripts per sample, shows an alignment of 31% for latent bc- <dig>  51% for lytic bc- <dig>  and 68% for latent bcbl- <dig>  a similar analysis for ebv has an alignment of 11% for latent bc- <dig> and 46% for lytic bc- <dig>  tiling arrays are comprehensive and can detect the full range of viral transcripts from kshv and ebv, whereas lc-ms/ms is more limited in its dynamic range; thus, the number of viral proteins that may be expressed is likely under-represented . overall, the alignments of transcriptomes and proteomes improve for both kshv and ebv when the lytic cycle is induced.

the total number of detected kshv transcripts in latent bc- <dig> increases  <dig> -fold upon lytic induction . the total number of detected kshv proteins in latent bc- <dig> increases  <dig> -fold upon lytic induction . the total number of detected ebv transcripts in latent bc- <dig> increases  <dig> -fold upon lytic induction . the total number of detected ebv proteins in latent bc- <dig> increases  <dig> -fold upon lytic induction . the total number of detected kshv proteins in latent bcbl- <dig> is generally the same as in lytic bcbl- <dig> , but the majority of kshv proteins detected in lytic bcbl- <dig>  were already detected in bcbl- <dig> without lytic induction.

in addition to tabulated alignments, graphic alignments were generated and grouped in three tiers: 1) viral gene annotation, 2) viral transcriptomes, and 3) viral proteomes . complete alignments for both kshv  and ebv  were generated for each cell line. specific regions of kshv  and ebv  were chosen to depict selected cell lines and conditions in greater detail with respect to novel viral genes and latent gene classification.

novel kshv annotation
analysis of viral transcriptomes identified several unannotated transcripts antisense to known genes . specific transcripts detected in kshv without any prior characterization include antisense-k4s , antisense-pan/k <dig> , and antisense-orf58/ <dig> . additional unannotated transcripts have been previously published and are consistently detected in this study , including t <dig>  and t <dig>  , described by taylor et al,  <dig>  <cit> ; antisense-orf <dig> , described by xu and ganem,  <dig>  <cit> ; a transcript antisense to the leftward-end , a transcript antisense to viral interleukin- <dig> and orf <dig> , and antisense to latent transcripts, , described by chandriani and ganem,  <dig>  <cit> , and chandriani et al,  <dig>  <cit> . multiple short, putative peptides are associated with several of these unannotated transcripts .

kshv and ebv nucleotide positions are based on the sequences nc_ <dig> and nc_ <dig>  respectively.

proposed gene names for kshv and ebv follow viral nomenclature conventions described by russo et al,  <dig>  <cit> , and baer et al,  <dig>  <cit> , respectively. these gene names are indicated in bold.

temporary gene names are indicated through the text, including previously-published gene names.

direct. = direction; ref. = reference; α¢ = antisense; arf = alternative reading frame; orf = open reading frame; aa = length in amino acids; fw = forward strand; rc = reverse complement strand.

the antisense-vil6/orf <dig> transcript is associated with a novel protein . this novel protein is the fourth most frequently-detected in latent bc- <dig> based on total peptide spectra corresponding to one orf . the antisense-vil6/orf <dig> peptide is also detected in lytic bc- <dig>  and in both latent and lytic bcbl- <dig> samples ; the number of peptide spectra increase upon lytic induction in both bc- <dig> and bcbl- <dig>  antisense-vil6/orf <dig> contains a short, predicted orf  with two possible start methionines . there is also an arf of orf <dig> that is calculated to be  <dig> amino acids in length , as well as an arf of orf <dig> that is calculated to be  <dig> amino acids in length . both arf proteins met our criteria as novel proteins, although their transcripts cannot be detected distinct from their known-frame counterparts, and thus, were not evaluated for proteome/transcriptome alignment. the arf-orf <dig> peptide is detected in both latent and lytic bc- <dig> samples, and the arf-orf <dig> peptide is detected in latent bc- <dig> and latent bcbl- <dig> 

a 3'-bias of fluorescently-labeled transcripts  reveals previously unrecognized mrna extensions of known viral genes at their 3'-ends, including orf <dig>  orf <dig>  k <dig> , and orf <dig> . we also found evidence that two orfs, k <dig> and k <dig>  begin upstream of their currently annotated start sites. for k <dig>  multiple unique peptide sequences are detected within upstream repeats and may correspond to kaposin isoforms b or c ; all detected k <dig> peptide sequences are in the same frame . for k <dig>  an upstream peptide is detected which includes the presently assigned start methionine ; this suggests that the k <dig> protein is larger than previously described.

novel ebv annotation
new transcripts detected in ebv include antisense-ebna3b and antisense-ebna3c . one novel protein in ebv is antisense to bplf <dig> and adjacent to the u exon of the ebna transcripts . two peptide sequences were detected corresponding to antisense-bplf <dig>  with only one spectrum detected in latent bc- <dig> and a total of nine spectra detected in the lytically-induced bc- <dig> sample , suggesting that antisense-bplf <dig> is a lytic protein. this orf has two potential start methionines, encoding either a  <dig> or  <dig> amino acid protein . no transcript was detected over the reference sample corresponding to this novel protein . we detected multiple peptide sequences and spectra in an arf of balf <dig> . arf-balf <dig> is calculated to be  <dig> amino acids in length. this novel protein maps to a repetitive region insufficiently tiled by the array; thus, we cannot characterize its associated transcripts. finally, an orf upstream to balf <dig>  is observed multiple times and is calculated to be  <dig> amino acids in length. one peptide spectrum was detected corresponding to the unannotated protein arf-ebna <dig>  or bkrf <dig>  . the arf-ebna <dig> transcript cannot be distinctly-detected from that of ebna <dig> 

latent and lytic evaluation of kshv
comparisons of transcriptomes from latent bc- <dig>  with either bcbl- <dig> or jsc- <dig>  confirms that latent gene expression is more restricted in bc- <dig>  the number of kshv transcripts detected over reference in latent bc- <dig>  is also reduced compared to jsc- <dig> and bcbl- <dig> . additionally, the number of kshv peptide spectra in latent bc- <dig> is reduced compared to the total kshv peptide spectra in latent bcbl- <dig> . the pattern of restricted latency observed with the bc- <dig> cell line broadly supports the gene expression classification described by sarid et al,  <dig>  <cit> . kshv class i genes are constitutively expressed , kshv class ii genes are expressed at low constitutive levels but are induced during lytic virus replication , and kshv class iii genes are only expressed during induction . several distinctions between latent/lytic class ii genes and lytic-only class iii genes were resolved in our studies .

using the  <dig> -fold cutoff,  <dig> kshv transcripts were detected over reference with latent bc- <dig> conditions  suggesting their assignment to either kshv class i or class ii. we only analyzed the  <dig> hour time point after lytic induction, which is insufficient to accurately address which genes belong to kshv class i or class ii. what is clear is that using a  <dig> -fold cutoff these  <dig> genes are readily detected over reference in latent bc- <dig>  several of these genes are also detected at the protein level. examples of kshv genes observed with multiple peptide spectra in latent bc- <dig> include vil <dig> ; viral interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  or virf <dig> ; virf <dig>  also known as lana <dig> ; and lana <dig> , consistent with each of these genes being expressed during latency.

in addition to latent genes, select lytic and virion-associated proteins are sensitively detected across all samples. one peptide spectrum corresponding to orf <dig>  kshv's major capsid protein , was detected in latent bc- <dig> and  <dig> peptide spectra were detected upon lytic induction. in latent and lytic bcbl- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> peptide spectra were detected, respectively. the viral processivity factor- <dig> , orf <dig>  is detected with  <dig> peptide spectra in latent bc- <dig> and with  <dig> peptide spectra upon lytic induction. pf- <dig> is detected with even greater spectral observations in bcbl- <dig> in both latent and lytic conditions . these data indicate that while kshv lytic cycle protein production  is minimally found in bc- <dig> without induction, spontaneous levels of lytic expression can be detected. these proteins markedly increase after lytic induction and are detected at higher levels in both non-induced and induced bcbl- <dig> 

latent and lytic evaluation of ebv
the type i, ii, and iii latency programs of ebv's viral gene expression are determined by the promoters used for active transcription in untreated culture conditions ; ebv's latency types are independent of lytic-reactivation, and are not to be confused with the three classes of kshv gene expression. ebv-positive pel and bl lines were classified according to the detection of ebv genes corresponding to these ebv-latency programs. viral genes were minimally reassessed according to ebv-latency type due to varying levels of spontaneous reactivation of ebv in the cell lines assayed . we do not detect any of the transcripts for epstein-barr nuclear antigens in the pel cell lines except for ebna <dig> . we detect the complex spliced transcripts--rpms <dig>  a <dig>  and barf <dig> co-terminal transcripts--encoding the bart  mirnas in jsc- <dig> and bc- <dig> . we unexpectedly detect ebers  which lack poly-adenylation; ebers are likely inefficiently labeled but still detected due to their very high levels of expression in the majority of ebv-positive cells  <cit> . the latent membrane protein  - <dig> and - <dig> transcripts  are not detected, although overlapping detection of bnlf2a/b at the 3'-end of lmp <dig> reduces our ability to confidently assess lmp <dig> expression status. restricted expression of ebna <dig>  barts, and ebers is indicative of type i ebv-latency in pels, consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

the bzlf <dig> transcript encoding the lytic switch protein zebra  is detected in jsc- <dig> and bc- <dig> . detection of bzlf <dig> is consistent with spontaneous lytic induction. we also sensitively detect lytic and virion-associated proteins, such as ebv's mcp, bclf <dig>  and ebv's processivity factor, bmrf <dig>  bclf <dig> is associated with  <dig> and  <dig> peptide spectra in latent and lytic bc- <dig>  respectively; bmrf <dig> is associated with  <dig> and  <dig> peptide spectra in latent and lytic bc- <dig>  respectively.

in contrast to pels, the bl mutuiii has detectable ebna <dig>  -3a, -3c, -lp , lmp <dig>  and lmp2a, and similarly has detectable ebna <dig>  the complex spliced barts, and variably-detected ebers . this pattern of gene expression is indicative of type iii ebv-latency, consistent with previous findings for mutuiii  <cit> . we also variably detect bhrf <dig> and barf <dig> in mutuiii and pel samples . bzlf <dig> is not detected in mutuiii.

discussion
proteome and transcriptome correlation for ebv and kshv
high-resolution separations with mass spectrometry and custom tiling arrays were used to provide a comprehensive measure of the expression of viral genes in a total of three pel and two bl cell lines. we evaluated viral proteomes and viral transcriptomes in cells singly-infected with either kshv or ebv, dually-infected with both kshv and ebv, or containing neither virus. latent and lytic conditions were also used to differentially detect viral genes in response to manipulating the viral life cycle. altogether, integrated proteome and transcriptome analysis was validated as a method to comprehensively detect both known and novel viral genes expressed in naturally-infected human cells.

integrating viral transcriptomes with viral proteomes resulted in efficient correlation of viral genes detected with both methods, and compensated for the limits of detection for either method alone. lc-ms/ms based proteomics proved to be more sensitive than tiling arrays in detecting expression from lytic genes, including those reported in mature virions  <cit> . an advantage of mass spectrometry over other methods of protein detection is that a pre-existing pool of available antibodies is not required. for these reasons, many more ebv proteins were detected in bc- <dig> than have been detected previously, further validating the ~2% spontaneous lytic induction of ebv in this cell line  <cit> .

this method can identify large or small proteins with or without a start methionine, similar to the recently updated annotation of yersinia pestis  <cit> . lc-ms/ms analysis efficiently detected viral peptides amongst the full cell repertoire. as much as  <dig> % of all peptide spectra were determined to be viral in lytic bcbl- <dig>  and  <dig> % of all observed spectra were determined to be viral in uninduced bcbl- <dig>  this fraction of viral peptides is roughly comparable to our previous determination that  <dig> % of all detected transcripts are kshv-derived in uninduced bcbl- <dig>  <cit> .

tiling arrays proved more comprehensive than lc-ms/ms, quantifying the expression of all viral genes for each sample. tiling arrays eliminate the bias of hand-picking select viral genes to detect and classify entire profiles of latent gene expression. tiling arrays also optimize the detection of viral genes by using multiple unique probes for one transcript, an advantage over low-density spotting arrays or individual primer/probe sets used for pcr-based detection. this approach also efficiently filters viral transcripts from the full cell repertoire by selective sequence hybridization and normalization. additionally, the use of tiling arrays highlights the importance of strand-specificity in the detection of viral transcripts, as many sense/antisense gene pairs were identified. this observation is consistent with recent strand-specific analysis of mycoplasma and mouse genomes  <cit> .

detection of viral genes without protein/transcript alignment
cases in which individual proteins and transcripts are not correlated remain informative. instances where proteins are observed without detectable transcripts may result from increased protein stability relative to transcript turnover. this possibility may explain efficient detection of mvps, including capsid, tegument, envelope, and other associated proteins. specific genes that appear to be sensitive markers for low levels of lytic induction include mcp homologues orf <dig> of kshv and bclf <dig> of ebv, and pf homologues orf <dig> of kshv and bmrf <dig> of ebv. additionally, proteins that are stable and expressed from a small percentage of cells entering the lytic cycle may have very low levels of transcripts due to the dilution of these cells by the predominant latent population. this possibility likely explains most of the kshv viral proteins detected in latent bc- <dig> without associated transcripts.

instances where transcripts are observed without detectable proteins may result from the nature of lc-ms/ms analysis. we used extensive strong cation exchange  fractionation prior to lc-ms/ms analyses to improve the detection of low abundance kshv and ebv peptide sequences over a dynamic range limit based upon previous experience  <cit> . however, multiple intrinsic properties of the digested peptides themselves can also affect the overall levels of detection and identification, such as their size, solubility, and electrospray ionization efficiency. thus, viral proteins may be under-represented. finally, peptides can be detected by ms/ms spectra but not assigned  due to the use of filters needed to constrain the false discovery rate ; in this regard more than half the peptides detected remain unassigned, typical for ms/ms studies where fdr is constrained. we note that the use of the mass spectrometry-generating function  in this work significantly enhanced the effectiveness of peptide identification at the selected low fdr. the use of spectral count quantitation has been shown effective for relative quantitation from lc-ms/ms  <cit> . additional explanations for detecting transcripts without detecting proteins is that not all viral transcripts encode proteins , specific transcripts may be expressed abundantly relative to their encoded protein, , and translation from select transcripts may be inhibited by mirnas without significant mrna destabilization .

transcriptome and proteome analysis reveal annotation gaps
the combined transcriptome and proteome alignment validated the detection of known viral genes and identified novel viral genes. we identified  <dig> unannotated viral transcripts and  <dig> unannotated viral proteins . the unannotated transcript antisense-vil6/orf <dig> matched a recurring novel protein detected in both bc- <dig> and bcbl- <dig> cell lines in both latent and lytic conditions. chandriani et al,  <dig>  <cit> , identified this transcript associated with polysomes by immunoprecipitation, consistent with our detection of this novel protein.

reporting transcript levels linearly along viral genomes highlighted specific regions at the 3'-ends of known genes inconsistent with current annotation. although most transcripts were within  <dig> bp of their annotated boundaries, specific viral genes were significantly extended, including orf <dig>  and orf <dig> . thus, linear evaluation of tiling array data is more informative than using heat map analysis alone. the boundaries of some specific genes can also be extended based on lc-ms/ms analysis, including k <dig> and k <dig>  the k <dig> locus has previously been shown to give rise to kaposin isoforms b and c, which extend beyond the 5'-end of kaposin a  <cit> . the k <dig> gene is known to vary in kshv among strains  <cit> , although extension of its protein sequence has not been previously reported.

many putative peptides were also detected in both kshv and ebv , consisting of short orfs with a limited number of unique sequences and observations. putative peptides may arise from novel viral genes, but may also arise from novel cellular genes or incorrect spectral assignment of peptides containing multiple coding mutations. coding mutations will also reduce the detection of viral peptides as a result of sequence variability among strains  <cit> . recent analysis of the antisense-orf <dig> region of kshv supports the hypothesis that this transcript gives rise to multiple short peptides that are not related to the function of their sense counterparts  <cit> . these short peptides have been proposed to diversify antigen presentation products in vivo  <cit> . the functions of novel viral proteins and transcripts are largely unknown, and warrant further investigation as to their roles in the viral life cycle and cancer progression.

evaluation of viral latency and lytic reactivation
induction of the lytic cycle in pel cell lines was observed with robust increases in lytic gene expression at both transcript  and protein levels . lytic manipulation of these cell lines facilitates efficient detection of multiple viral genes not detected during latency, and also validates the detection of specific novel viral genes. specifically, antisense-vil6/orf <dig>  of kshv and antisense-bplf <dig>  of ebv were both responsive to lytic induction. variations in the patterns of viral gene expression reflect previous reports of restricted latency, spontaneous lytic induction, and lytic reactivation of the cell lines assayed  <cit> . thus, manipulation of the viral life cycle has validated this approach to efficiently detect viral gene products in naturally-infected human cells.

CONCLUSIONS
results summary
the correlation of detected viral proteins and transcripts was highly complementary for kshv's genes, and to a lesser extent for ebv's genes. individual genes not detected by both methods remained informative, providing clues regarding protein stability, post-transcriptional regulation, and coding potential. the alignment of viral transcriptomes and proteomes revealed gaps in viral annotation, including the detection and validation of novel viral genes. manipulation of the viral life cycle resulted in the detection of greater numbers of viral transcripts and proteins in lytically-induced samples relative to untreated  samples. elevated levels of spontaneous lytic induction versus tight-latency were confirmed for specific pel and bl cell lines. this systems biology approach provides a comprehensive view of viral gene expression that could not have been attained using either method alone.

implications
we were able to sensitively detect viral proteins amongst the full background of cellular proteins in two pel cell lines, and we identified candidate viral proteins by using high-resolution separations and mass spectrometry. combining candidate viral proteins with candidate viral transcripts correlates more directly with the actual abundance and function of these viral products, and provides insights into their biological importance in disease states. additional evaluation of tumor samples or diseased tissues with lc-ms/ms may also help identify cellular proteins biologically important for the development and progression of human disease. aligning viral transcripts detected by custom tiling array to viral proteins detected by lc-ms/ms analysis proved to be a high-throughput and sensitive approach to identify known viral genes, to validate unannotated viral genes, and discover novel viral genes. the discovery of novel viral transcripts in human tumors coupled with lc-ms/ms analysis is a potentially powerful method for establishing virus-disease relationships.
