BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short  non-protein-coding rnas. in metazoans, mirna initially thought to be primarily involved in post-transcriptional control  <cit>  have now been shown to have profound and tissue-specific effects on mrna transcript abundance across significant fractions of the transcriptome  <cit> . concurrently it has been demonstrated that mirnas have a central role in development and organogenesis  <cit> . in the context of the apparent interactions between mirna and transcriptional control and mounting evidence for the localized component of transcriptional control  <cit> , we performed a genome-wide study of c. elegans to determine a) if there were localized effects of mirna on transcription and b) if previously identified "seed matching" between mirna and their gene targets could explain, in part, the observed decrease in expression around some mirnas.

RESULTS
first, the  <dig> known mirnas in c. elegans were mapped to the worm genome and genes near each mirnas were sought. ninety-six mirnas were found with at least one gene within  <dig> kb and  <dig> mirna were found within the introns of protein-coding genes. detailed information about the mirnas is found in supplemental data. two experiments of genome-wide expression profiling in c. elegans were analyzed. the first dataset by kim et al.  <cit>  included various growth and developmental conditions and the second investigated the c. elegans germline  <cit> . the number of genes whose positional information was available was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . of the  <dig> mirnas with at least one gene in the  <dig> kb vicinity, there were  <dig> mirnas for which no microarray expression measurement was available for those genes in the vicinity . in the kim data, the expression level of one gene near one of the  <dig> mirnas was not correctly measured and thus  <dig> mirnas had valid expression data in the  <dig> kb vicinity.

the normalized average expression levels  in the vicinity of the 83– <dig> mirnas in c. elegans were calculated over several successively wider "windows" of physical distance each centered on the position of a specified mirna. figure 1a and 1b show the normalized expression levels for each mirna in the kim and germline datasets, respectively. it should be noted that these graphs show only the mirnas with at least one gene in the narrowest window of  <dig> kb width. in what follows, we will refer to such a mirna as "mirna with gene in the  <dig> kb window." because some mirnas, which were close to each other, were surrounded by the same protein-coding genes, such mirnas were grouped as a cluster. there were five such clusters in both datasets and each cluster was treated as one entry in figure  <dig>  each mirna or cluster is assigned a number according to its chromosomal position and this number was used for the numbering on the axis labeled "mirna". detailed information on the numbering is found in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  these graphs reveal that the normalized expression levels are smaller than  <dig>  near the majority of mirnas in the germline dataset.

in the kim data, the normalized expression levels near  <dig> out of the  <dig> mirnas with gene in the  <dig> kb window are smaller than  <dig> . in the germline data, the corresponding number is  <dig> out of the  <dig> mirnas with gene in the  <dig> kb window. these mirnas are considered to be mirnas with low-expression genes in their vicinity. of these mirnas,  <dig> are common in both datasets. of the mirnas with high-expression genes,  <dig> are common in the datasets. distributions of the normalized average expression in the  <dig> kb window are shown in figure 1c  and 1d  . in these histograms, distributions of the normalized averages in other distance ranges are also plotted: the light blue and yellow bars represent a distance range between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb and a distance range between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively.

we investigated whether or not the decreased level of gene expression was observable in the average over all the 83– <dig> mirnas although we recognize that the mirnas are hardly the only regulators of gene expression level and that many other factors come into play in determining levels . figures 1e and 1f show the averaged expression levels calculated in each sized window over the 83– <dig> mirnas. these graphs revealed a marked decrease in transcriptional abundance of those genes in proximity to mirna, most evident within  <dig> kb or less. this contrasts with the expression levels relative to  <dig>  randomly picked locations in the c. elegans genome that revealed no such proximal decrease . in each sized window, the average expression of the genes around mirna was compared with that of the randomly selected genes. results of t test indicate that in the germline dataset, the expression of the genes around mirna is significantly lower  than that of the randomly selected genes in the  <dig> kb window. in contrast, in the kim dataset, the tendency does not reach significance.

when comparing the results from the two datasets , the germline data show a clearer decrease in proximity to mirna. this may be explained by the following facts. first, the dataset by kim et al. includes a wide variety of samples from several growth conditions, developmental stages and varieties of mutants  <cit> . as mentioned earlier, mirnas appear to play an important role in development, organogenesis and gametogenesis  <cit> . although the kim dataset includes some developmental datasets, the development-specific effects of mirna may be diluted by the variety of other conditions included. in contrast, the germline dataset contains samples from mutants with defects in germline proliferation or gamete production  <cit>  so the stage-specific mirna effect is less likely to be muddied. in fact, a subset of kim data, which were obtained from germ cells, showed a stronger effect .

there is a possibility that the genes in proximity to mirna are not real genes and thus the decreased expression level near mirna can be explained by low expression of such genes. we examined the possibility in the following way. the expression levels of the  <dig> genes in the narrowest window in the germline data were investigated in all experimental conditions to see if there were any times when those genes did not have low values . this analysis revealed that the  <dig> genes were highly expressed  in various experiments  and that it was just their average that was low. this suggests that those genes with low expression near mirna are real, functioning genes.

the relationship between mirnas and their putative gene targets were analyzed to see if these accounted for any of the observed decrease in expression. the numbers of matching sites in the genes to bases 2– <dig> of the mature forms of the mirnas, which are termed the "seeds" of the mirna  <cit> , were counted. seed matching between mirna and their target genes have previously been found to have predictive value on transcript abundance  <cit> . the distribution of such seed matching was investigated to determine if it could account for mrna transcript abundance and for the observed local decrease of expression around mirna.

first, to examine whether there was any relationship between seed matching and expression levels , we compared two extreme groups. of the genes in the  <dig> kb windows, we selected the  <dig> % fraction with the lowest expression levels  and the same number of genes from the highest expression levels . then, the number of the seed matches between those genes and mirnas were counted. to reduce the computational time, we analyzed only pairs which are on the same chromosome. the lowest5% group had  <dig> seed matches whereas  <dig> matches were found in the highest5% group. this revealed that the number of the seed matches obtained from the lowest5% genes is greater than that from highest5%, supporting a relationship between the number of seed matches and expression levels.

further, we counted the number of the seed matches  around the protein-coding genes selected from the following six distance ranges: i) <  <dig> kb, ii)  <dig> –  <dig> kb, iii)  <dig> –  <dig> kb, iv)  <dig> –  <dig> kb, v)  <dig> –  <dig> kb and vi) >  <dig> kb. seed matches with the messenger of each protein coding gene  were identified. the number of the seed matches per gene is shown in figure  <dig>  it was much larger in the unspliced mrna in the smallest distance range . table  <dig> summarizes the relationship between the expression level and the number of seed matches. in this table, the numbers of seed matches in the upstream and downstream regions are also given. the expression levels in this table represent the normalized average expression levels of the genes with seed matches in the smallest range. genes with seed matches in their message forms had lower expression levels than those with seed matches in other parts of the gene. because the 3' untranscribed region  was included in the unspliced mrna in this analysis, the results are consistent with the identification of validated mirna targets found in the 3' utr of genes  <cit>  although other sites for targeting have been identified. each dataset was divided into two groups according to whether the normalized expression level in the  <dig> kb window exceeded  <dig>   or not . the analysis of seed matches was repeated for those subsets. the results  provide further evidence for a relationship between expression level and the number of seed matches. these findings of increased seed matching of proximal genes that have low expression levels and the over-representation of seeds in the 3' end of putative gene targets provide a potential mechanism for the observed localized decrease in expression in the vicinity of mirna. neither 7-bp random sequences taken from non-protein-coding regions nor computationally generated random sequences could reproduce these results . these results indicate that the results in figure  <dig> reflect true biological phenomena and further suggest that the increased number of seed matches near mirna could explain, in part, the observed localized decrease.

we investigated the expression levels of the genes near the mirnas exist in introns of other protein-coding genes and the expression levels of the host genes. however, there appeared to be no clear relationship . this suggests that the localized decrease is not due to the mirnas in introns.

we identified gene ontology   <cit>  categories with an overrepresented number of genes near mirna . of the genes in wormbase,  <dig>  had go molecular function annotations while  <dig> genes  near mirna had annotations in molecular function. the number of the go molecular function categories including two or more genes out of the  <dig> was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> go biological process annotations were found in the whole dataset and the genes near mirna, respectively. the number of the go biological process categories including two or more genes out of the  <dig> was  <dig>  the χ <dig> test revealed that one category included a greater number of genes than expected by chance . the category was go <dig>  in biological process. two go biological process categories with overrepresented numbers of genes were obtained when this analysis was repeated using only the genes with seed match near the  <dig> common mirnas with low-expression genes  and near the  <dig> common mirnas with high-expression genes  . we also used the kegg  pathways which includes an overrepresented number of genes near mirna. of the genes in wormbase,  <dig>  were involved in at least one pathway while  <dig> of the genes  near mirna were found in the pathways. the number of the pathways including two or more genes out of the  <dig> genes was  <dig>  the χ <dig> test indicated that no pathway included a greater number of genes than expected by chance . when this analysis was repeated using only the genes with seed match near the common mirnas with low- or high-expression genes, no pathway was found to be enriched. although the biological importance of these results is currently obscure, these may provide insights into target genes and mechanisms of transcriptional control with mirnas.

without attempting to draw broader conclusions about these mechanisms we performed a similar analysis on the murine homologues of those mirna in c. elegans that showed the most decreased localized abundance in the above studies. we found similar phenomena in mice. expression levels of genes around  <dig> murine mirnas homologous to cel-mir- <dig> and cel-mir-let- <dig> were lower than the overall average level in three mouse datasets  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we performed a genome-wide study of c. elegans based on two independent studies. we found that there is a decrease of messenger rna  abundance, localized within a  <dig> kb of chromosomal distance of a majority of mirnas, in c. elegans germline. the precise nature of the mirna effect on transcription remains unclear even though the evidence of such effects is becoming more evident  <cit> . the localized decrease in expression of genes near  <dig> mirnas in c. elegans we have found in two experiments may be in part explained by the increased seed matches with proximal target genes but the mechanism of the effect of expression levels remains to be investigated.
