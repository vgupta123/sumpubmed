BACKGROUND
the innate immune response plays a critical role in pathogen detection and the resulting inflammatory response that arises to contain and eliminate foreign invasions into host tissues. infection of the mammary gland resulting in mastitis is an important and well characterized disease of dairy cattle, such as the holstein breed  <cit> . however, the incidence and severity of this disease in beef cattle has received little attention although two recent studies that examined mastitis prevalence in beef cows reported a moderate incidence with a surprising lack of escherichia coli induced mastitis  <cit> . this pathogen is a major cause of mastitis in dairy animals and thus differences in susceptibility to e. coli infection may exist between dairy and beef breeds. bovine mammary infections due to e. coli typically cause an acute response with inflammation ranging from mild and quickly resolving, to severe forms that can lead to sepsis, shock, and even death  <cit> . the response is initiated following recognition of e. coli lipopolysaccharide  by the extracellular toll-like receptor  <dig> , which is expressed on multiple cell types within the mammary gland  <cit> .

while there are multiple factors that can influence the inflammatory response to mammary gland infection, it has been suggested that host factors play the largest role in determining the severity of e. coli mastitis  <cit> . these host factors include age, stage of lactation, vaccination history, as well as genetic, and possibly epigenetic mechanisms all contributing to the magnitude and resolution of the host response. identification of genetic or epigenetic factors controlling the inflammatory response may lead to enhanced selection or management strategies to produce dairy animals that have reduced collateral damage from mastitis. for example, genetic polymorphisms within pathogen recognition receptors or signaling pathway intermediates have been shown to lead to differences in disease susceptibility  <cit> . epigenetic mechanisms, such as dna methylation or histone modifications can also influence gene expression resulting in phenotypic variation in immune response  <cit> . for example, human intestinal epithelial cells have increased dna methylation in the tlr <dig> gene promoter that reduces its expression and leads to a reduced responsiveness to lps  <cit> .

selective breeding of cattle has been employed for many generations to produce breeds differing in economically important traits such as enhanced milk production in dairy breeds, and greater feed efficiency and meat quality in beef breeds  <cit> . cattle breeding has even resulted in sub-species  that differ markedly in resistance to disease such as that caused by tick infestation  <cit>  or challenge with theileria annulata  <cit> . results from these studies suggest that b. taurus animals develop a greater inflammatory response to pathogens than do breeds of the b. indicus subspecies. within the b. taurus sub-breed, studies directly comparing the inflammatory response to mammary infection between dairy and beef breeds have not been conducted. to further investigate potential differences in immune responses between dairy and beef animals, we challenged dermal fibroblasts obtained from holstein  and angus  cows with lps and then used rna-seq to examine global gene expression differences. we also employed mira-seq to examine if global differences in the methylome could explain differences in the transcriptome.

RESULTS
fibroblast il- <dig> response
dermal fibroblasts  isolated from holstein and angus heifers were used to investigate differences in the innate immune response between dairy and beef breeds. fibroblasts isolated from holsteins produced considerably higher levels of il <dig>  in response to a  <dig> h lps  challenge  when compared to angus cultures . a similar pattern was observed following il1b  treatment , with holstein df having a greater magnitude of il <dig> response than angus df . there was no detectable il <dig> in media collected from un-stimulated holstein or angus fibroblasts.fig.  <dig> il <dig> protein production from holstein and angus fibroblasts. a il <dig> production by dermal fibroblasts isolated from 19-month old holstein  and angus  heifers and challenged for  <dig> h with lps  or il1b . b eight cultures  were randomly chosen for rna-seq and mira-seq analysis and levels of il <dig> protein following a second  <dig> h challenge with either lps  or il1b  on these  <dig> cultures are shown. there was no detectable il <dig> production from un-treated cultures of both breeds. values are mean ± sem. * indicates p <  <dig> , ** indicates p <  <dig> 



rna-seq and mira- seq analysis was performed on eight cultures  randomly selected from the pool of animals. these cultures were revived simultaneously from cryopreservation and prepared for a second challenge with lps and il1b. the holstein cultures produced approximately twice  as much il <dig> protein in response to lps compared to the angus cultures . similarly, differential il <dig> responses were observed following il1b exposure, with holstein cultures exhibiting a hyper-responsive phenotype in il <dig> protein production .

rna-seq analysis of holstein and angus lps response
total rna samples for rna-seq analysis were obtained from the four holstein and four angus cultures following lps exposure for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h. these  <dig> samples generated approximately  <dig> million reads per sample following quality control. alignment to the umd v <dig>  bovine genome resulted in  <dig> % of the reads falling within alignment parameters , thus an average of  <dig> million reads per sample. under our definition of expression , there were  <dig>  targets detected at hour  <dig>  which defined the core bovine fibroblast transcriptome under basal conditions. at hours  <dig> and  <dig> following lps treatment, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  targets detected, respectively. by combining breeds, and comparing basal gene expression to time points following lps-induced innate immune response,  <dig> transcripts were revealed to have differential gene expression  with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated at hour  <dig> post-lps . at hour  <dig> post-lps,  <dig> transcripts were discovered having differential gene expression compared to hour  <dig>  of which,  <dig> were up- and  <dig> were down- regulated . lps treatment of the fibroblast cultures induced various innate immune-associated genes in the lps signaling pathway and those coding for response proteins . there were temporal differences in the induction of these genes following lps exposure for  <dig> or  <dig> h. early induced genes included several pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such il <dig>  il1a, tnf, chemokine  motif ligand   <dig>  and interferon regulatory factors   <dig> and  <dig>  following  <dig> h of lps exposure, several type i ifn-related genes showed greater expression compared to hour  <dig>  while tnf expression had returned to basal levels.table  <dig> average response to lps from combined holstein and angus cultures measured by increases in expression of immune-associated genes compared to hour  <dig> post-lps

a comparison between holstein and angus cultures revealed  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially expressed  genes  at hours  <dig>   <dig>  and 8-post lps, respectively . of these genes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, had higher expression levels in holstein cultures compared to angus cultures. pathway enrichment analysis was completed with david and genes with differential expression between the breeds at  <dig> h post-lps were involved with the mapk  and tgf-beta  signaling pathways. by  <dig> h post-lps, the nod-like , toll-like , and rig-i-like  receptor signaling pathways were represented in our set of de genes between the two breeds. table  <dig> lists several of the de genes that are involved in the innate immune response. tlr <dig>  nod <dig>  and traf <dig>  genes involved with the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns and activation of nfκb pathway, were more expressed in holstein cultures. chemokines such as chemokine  ligand   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and il <dig> that recruit monocytes, t cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils to sites of infection also had higher expression levels in holstein fibroblasts. in addition to genes related to the innate immune response, differences were observed in genes that have been implicated in dna methylation, such as the family of dna methyltransferase  genes and ubiquitin-like with phd and ring finger domains  <dig>   <cit> . expression of dnmt3a and 3b, which are involved with de novo dna methylation, were similar between the breeds. however, expression of dnmt <dig>  which is responsible for maintenance of dna methylation patterns following dna replication, was  <dig> -fold higher at hour  <dig> and  <dig> -fold higher at hours  <dig> and  <dig> in angus cultures compared to holstein cultures. angus cultures also had  <dig> –,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold higher expression of uhrf <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h post-lps treatment . interestingly, greater activation of a potentially anti-inflammatory signaling pathway in angus cultures was noted by the  <dig> -fold higher expression of the gene encoding chemokine  receptor  <dig>  at hour  <dig> compared to holsteins. while cxcr <dig> expression was not different at hours  <dig> and  <dig> post-lps, the sole ligand of this receptor, cxcl <dig>  was expressed  <dig> –,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold higher in angus cultures at hour  <dig> and at  <dig> and  <dig> h post lps stimulation.fig.  <dig> scatter plots of rna-seq analysis. eight fibroblast cultures  were used in rna-seq to explore gene expression differences. scatter plots of indices analyzed from rna-seq data were generated for expression level  and differential expression  at  <dig> h ,  <dig> h , and  <dig> h  following lps exposure. positive fold change values indicate higher expression in holstein cultures while negative fold change values show higher expression in angus cultures. red dots denote fdr <  <dig>

rt-qpcr confirmation of rna-seq
several immune-response associated genes were selected for rt-qpcr confirmation of expression differences observed between holstein and angus cultures following lps treatment as determined by rna-seq. tlr <dig>  il <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and tnf showed similar expression levels in rt-qpcr analysis in comparison to the rna-seq data set. basal expression of il <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and tnf was similar between the breeds. however, by  <dig> h after lps stimulation, marked differences were observed between holstein and angus expression of il <dig>  tnf, ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  with a  <dig> –,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> - fold higher expression in holstein fibroblasts compared to angus fibroblasts . a similar pattern was observed at  <dig> h, with holstein cultures having higher expression in the following genes: il <dig> , tnf , ccl <dig> , and ccl <dig> . lps exposure did not induce tlr <dig> expression in either breed; however, holstein cultures consistently expressed higher levels of tlr <dig> compared to angus cultures . in general, gene expression values determined by rt-qpcr are in agreement with the transcriptomic results from rna-seq data.fig.  <dig> selected gene expression by holstein and angus fibroblasts in response to lps. differences in expression of tlr <dig>  il <dig>  tnf  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  between holstein and angus fibroblast cultures at hours  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-lps exposure were determined by rt-qpcr. values are expressed as delta ct, or the difference in cycles to threshold  between the gene of interest and the endogenous gene control beta-actin . fold differences  in expression between holstein and angus cultures are indicated in parentheses. all values are mean ± sem. . *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  



mira-seq
the  <dig> dna samples  processed for mira-seq analysis resulted in approximately  <dig> million reads per sample following quality control. alignment to the bovine umd v <dig>  reference genome yielded  <dig> % of reads falling within alignment parameters  and an average of  <dig> million mapped reads per sample. to determine differential methylation rates between holstein and angus fibroblasts, the genome was divided into 3kb windows, and then the read count in each window was compared. analysis of the 3kb windows revealed  <dig> regions that had different levels of methylation between holstein and angus cultures based on the following thresholds: fdr <  <dig> ; cpm > 1; fc ≥  <dig> . of these differentially methylated regions ,  <dig> had higher rates of methylation in cultures from holstein animals, while  <dig> displayed higher methylation levels in angus fibroblasts. of the  <dig> regions with higher methylation in holstein,  <dig> were found partially within an annotated gene while  <dig> were not. within the  <dig> dmr with higher methylation levels in angus cultures  <dig> fell within annotated genes while the remaining  <dig> regions did not. only two of the dmr  were located within the defined promoter regions of genes: a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs  <dig>  and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor type  <dig> . these dmrs were not reflected by differences in expression of either gene between the holstein and angus cultures at hours  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-lps . a dmr spanning intron  <dig> and exon  <dig> of the agouti signaling protein  gene had greater methylation in the angus cells and was associated with a marked increase in its expression in these cells at all time points.table  <dig> differentially methylated 3kb regions between holstein and angus cultures as determined by mira-seq and gene expression data for annotated genes

influence of dna methylation on gene expression
the genome-wide association between gene expression and methylation levels within a gene body or gene promoter region was investigated by plotting mira-seq values for a gene body or gene promoter against rna-seq values for  <dig> h post-lps. as data from the two breeds appeared similar, the combined data points from both the holstein and angus cultures were binned as either low or high, with a gating value of reads per kilobase per million matched reads  = <dig> for rna-seq or rpkm =  <dig>  for mira-seq. when the relationship between methylation levels in either the gene promoter region or the gene body and that gene’s subsequent expression level was analyzed, it revealed the two values were significantly dependent upon one another , for gene promoter  and gene body , respectively. this indicates a strong inverse relationship between methylation in either the gene promoter or gene body and the level of gene expression. analysis of the 0- and 2-h time points following lps treatment gave similar results .fig.  <dig> role of dna methylation on gene expression and differential methylation levels due to genomic location. as there were no significant effects of breed on the correlations between genomic location of dna methylation and subsequent gene expression, data was combined for the  <dig> holstein and  <dig> angus cultures in this analysis. scatter plots show the relation between gene expression at  <dig> h post-lps treatment and levels of dna methylation at the gene’s promoter  or gene body  gene expression levels  and dna methylation  were normalized to gene size and presented as rpkm. c the average methylation levels of combined holstein and angus mira-seq libraries based upon genomic region. lettering denotes differential methylation levels as measured by a one-way anova with bonferonni post-test . all values are mean ± sem



levels of dna methylation were also measured, as rpkm, in gene promoters, gene bodies, or intergenic regions . data from un-treated cultures of the  <dig> holstein and  <dig> angus were combined for this analysis, as there were no significant breed differences. levels of methylation in all three regions were significantly different , with gene promoters having the lowest and intergenic regions having the highest levels of methylation.

discussion
variation exists between cows in their innate immune response to mastitis. a greater understanding of the basis for this variation could facilitate new breeding, selection, or management practices to develop animals with superior ability to contain and eliminate pathogens from the normally sterile mammary gland. we have previously used dermal fibroblasts to model this animal variation within groups of holstein cows  <cit> . in these studies we found substantial differences between dairy cows in the magnitude of their fibroblasts’ response following treatment with lps or pam2csk <dig> that are ligands for tlr <dig> and tlr2/ <dig>  respectively. intra-mammary bacterial challenges were also conducted on groups of lactating animals from these studies that had been classified as having low or high responding phenotypes. low responding animals developed a reduced inflammatory response characterized by less leakage of bovine serum albumin  into milk, as well as a less severe reduction in milk quality, as determined by a lower milk somatic cell count. this reduced response was accompanied by similar bacterial clearance rates between the phenotypes, suggesting the heightened response of the high responding animals did not offer any advantage in resolution of the infection. there is limited data to suggest that a high response phenotype is characteristic of dairy in comparison to beef breeds of cattle  and thus, in the current study, we have expanded our use of the fibroblast model to explore differences between a dairy breed  and a beef breed  in their innate responses to lps exposure.

previous studies have looked at differences in the innate immune response between dairy breeds  following an intra-mammary challenge with s. aureus  <cit>  or e. coli  <cit> . while there was high inter-animal variation in milk levels of il <dig> and tnf during the challenge, the overall responses were similar between holstein and jersey animals. this suggested that the innate immune response is conserved between these two dairy breeds. likewise, an intravenous lps challenge comparing beef breeds  revealed small differences in the serum response profiles of tnf and il1b  <cit> . each of these studies examined differences within dairy or within beef breeds, while few studies have explored differences in innate immune responses between a dairy and a beef breed. in one such study, skin biopsies were collected from holstein  and brahman  animals following an experimental tick challenge to compare localized innate immune responses at tick-attachment sites  <cit> . microarray analysis of the biopsies revealed that holstein animals had greater expression of many innate immune response-associated genes in comparison to the brahmans. it was suggested that the greater expression of chemokine and cytokines at tick-attachment sites might facilitate feeding by the tick, thereby leading to the lower resistance to tick infestations observed in the holstein breed. similarly, holstein and sahiwal  calves were used to explore breed differences in the inflammatory response  <cit> . in that study, calves from both breeds underwent an experimental challenge with theileria annulata, the protozoan parasite that causes bovine theileriosis. holstein calves experienced severe clinical symptoms following the challenge while sahiwal calves seemed better able to control the inflammatory response. furthermore, we have previously presented data from a related experiment, now being prepared for full publication, indicating that holstein heifers have greater serum il <dig> and tnf levels after an intravenous lps challenge compared to age-matched angus heifers  <cit> . in our current study, a comparison of holstein and angus fibroblasts revealed significant breed differences in response to an lps challenge, with holstein cultures exhibiting a hyper-responsive phenotype compared to the hypo-responsiveness of angus cultures.

holstein vs. angus differences in lps response
rna-seq analysis of lps-challenged fibroblasts revealed a large number of immune-associated differentially expressed genes between holstein and angus cultures. many of these genes are known to play critical roles in the response to — and the recovery from — bacterial infections such as e. coli mastitis  <cit> . in particular, tlr <dig>  which is the extracellular receptor responsible for recognition of lps, was expressed at higher levels in holstein cultures before  and following lps stimulation . this may suggest the holstein animals will detect and respond to gram-negative bacteria more vigorously than angus animals. additionally, several subunits of the nfkb transcription factor complex were differentially expressed between breeds. specifically, holstein cultures had greater expression of relb  at hours  <dig> and  <dig>  and nfkb <dig>  and nfkb <dig>  at hour  <dig> post lps treatment. this transcription factor is central to innate immune signaling pathways leading from a diverse array of pattern recognition receptors including the tlr and nod receptor families  <cit> . once activated, nfkb promotes the transcription of chemokine and cytokine genes associated with the innate immune system. while the activity of nfkb is carefully regulated under normal conditions, excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to its further activation which may create a chronic inflammatory condition  <cit> . the higher expression of both tlr <dig> and the various subunits of nfkb complex in the holstein fibroblasts would enable the greater responsiveness to lps observed in this breed.

an appropriate innate immune response is also dependent on timely production of anti-inflammatory factors once the stimulatory agent has been eliminated. the chemokine receptor  <dig>  and its sole ligand, cxcl <dig> are important in this regard and their interaction has been shown to suppress tlr <dig> signaling and nfkb activation in response to lps in human embryonic kidney cells  <cit>  and to suppress lps-induced il <dig> production by murine bone marrow-derived macrophages  <cit> . the cxcl <dig> chemokine has the ability to activate anti-inflammatory pathways in t-cells and macrophages and to suppress inflammation  <cit> . a single injection of a cxcl <dig> analog administered to mice in parallel with lps was able to decrease the levels of lps-induced plasma tnf  <cit> . within our fibroblasts, angus cultures expressed greater levels of cxcr <dig> and cxcl <dig> prior to lps treatment. at hours  <dig> and  <dig> post-lps, cxcl <dig> expression continued to be higher in angus while the differences in cxcr <dig> expression disappeared. due to the inhibitory function of cxcr <dig> and cxcl <dig>  the higher basal expression of these two genes in angus cultures may have reduced their lps responsiveness.

breed differences in the expression of genes associated with the maintenance of dna methylation were also uncovered in rna-seq analysis. dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> were more highly expressed in angus cultures both basally and following lps exposure. dnmt <dig> is responsible for maintaining dna methylation patterns following replication  <cit> , and uhrf <dig> interacts with hemimethylated dna and recruits dnmt <dig> to facilitate methylation of the daughter strand  <cit> . greater expression of these two genes in angus cultures may indicate this breed is better able to maintain methylation levels. increased methylation of gene promoter regions is generally associated with reduced gene transcription and thus could account for the reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes in fibroblasts from this breed.

methylation differences between breeds
the breed comparison also included an examination into the potential role that differences in early life environment might play in determining breed differences in an animal’s epigenome. holstein calves are removed from their dams within  <dig> h of birth, moved to individual housing, and fed a milk replacer diet; while angus calves are allowed to nurse from the dam for months and are typically housed with the herd out on pasture. these environmental differences could affect dna-methylation patterns and lead to differences in gene transcription in response to immune stimulation. the mira-seq analysis of holstein and angus fibroblasts revealed  <dig> 3kb regions of the genome that were differentially methylated between breeds . in a global sense, the breed difference was minimal despite the higher expression of dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> in angus cultures. unexpectedly, genes involved in the lps-response pathway were under-represented in these  <dig> regions. while it would appear that dna methylation does not play a major role in the differential breed response to lps observed in our fibroblast model, mira-seq is only a moderate-resolution technique and a potential limitation of the current study. the mira technique is based on the high affinity of a two-protein complex formed by methyl-cpg-binding proteins  2b and 3l <dig>  which bind to methylated dna in a methylated cpg density-dependent manner  <cit> . regions of fragmented dna with greater methylated cpg content, such as cpg islands, will have enhanced affinity for the mbd complex, allowing for enrichment of these regions in the final analysis, whereas regions with low cpg content will be under-represented. while this allows for a comparison of the overall methylome between individuals, mira-seq is not sensitive enough to detect more subtle, but influential, differences in methylation at specific cpg sites. for example, differential methylation at a single cpg site in the il <dig> gene promoter was attributed to differential serum levels of il <dig> in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . patients that were experiencing elevated serum levels of il <dig> had lower methylation rates at a single cpg site in the gene promoter, suggesting that methylation at this site represses il <dig> transcription. subtle differences in cpg methylation between holstein and angus cultures may have been lost in our analysis. future studies of methylation differences between cattle breeds would benefit from a technology with greater resolving power such as those based on sequencing of bisulfite converted dna  <cit> .

identification of biomarkers linked to phenotypic responses
previously, we have demonstrated age-dependent increases in lps-responsiveness of fibroblasts collected from the same animals at  <dig> and  <dig> months of age  <cit> . cultures isolated from young  holsteins produced considerably lower levels of il <dig> following lps exposure compared to cultures collected from the older  holsteins. rna-seq analysis was completed on the young vs. old cultures following lps treatment, and revealed several pro-inflammatory response genes, including il <dig>  il <dig>  ccl <dig>  tnf, and cxcl <dig> that had greater expression in older cultures following lps stimulation  <cit> . comparing the rna-seq data sets from the previous young vs. older holstein study, and the current holstein vs. angus study revealed several genes that had similar expression patterns defining a high vs. low response phenotype. the higher response phenotype of older animals in the previous study, and holstein animals in the current study, is characterized by greater expression of tlr <dig>  il <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and tnf. these genes are critical in the recognition of and resulting inflammation following infection by gram-negative bacteria. the identification of this set of biomarkers from the global transcriptome may allow for greater precision in classifying an animal’s innate immune response phenotype even at a young age. this has potential utility in selecting low response replacement heifers as young calves to avoid raising high response animals that are more likely to develop severe rather than milder forms of coliform mastitis. alternatively, selective modification of the holstein genome with appropriate angus genes may be used to generate holstein animals with a reduced, potentially beneficial, innate response to infection.

CONCLUSIONS
our previous work on characterizing within-breed variation in innate immune response has now been extended to reveal substantial differences between a dairy and a beef breed. our fibroblast model system indicates that divergent selection for dairy or beef character has resulted in substantial differences in immune phenotypes between these breeds, with dairy animals being more responsive to lps than beef animals. genetic differences between the dairy and beef breeds are likely of key importance, but management differences resulting in differing in utero and neonatal environments may lead to epigenetic differences as well. events such as health of the dam during pregnancy or the level of maternal care a calf receives in early life may lead to epigenetic modifications that alter that animal’s innate immune response phenotype as an adult. our current studies also provide a set of gene expression biomarkers, measurable in dermal fibroblasts, which are indicative of an animal’s innate immune response magnitude.
