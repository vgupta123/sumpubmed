BACKGROUND
gram-negative proteobacteria deploy various types of protein secretion systems for exporting selected sets of proteins to the cell surface, the extracellular space or into host cells  <cit> . type iii secretion systems  are directly related to pathogenicity or to symbiosis with higher organisms and constitute essential mediators of the interactions between gram-negative bacterial cells and eukaryotic ones  <cit>  as the t3ss efficiently translocates bacterial proteins  directly into the host cell cytoplasm when fully developed.

the t3ss apparatus comprises three distinct parts: a) the basal body, which forms a cylindrical base that penetrates the two bacterial membranes and the periplasmic space; b) the extracellular part with the needle or the pilus as its main feature which is formed through the polymerization of specialized protein subunits that are t3ss substrates themselves; and c) the cytoplasmic part, which forms the export gate for secretion control. this apparatus is built by specific core proteins encoded by a conserved subset of genes tightly organized in gene clusters with counterparts in the bacterial flagellum  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of the core t3ss proteins revealed that the t3s systems evolved into seven distinct families that spread between bacteria by horizontal gene transfer.  the ysc-t3ss family, named after the archetypal yersinia system, is present in α-, β-, γ-, and δ- proteobacteria. at least in α-proteobacteria the system confers resistance to phagocytosis and triggers macrophage apoptosis.  the ssa-esc-t3ss family is named after the archetypal t3ss of enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic e.coli.  the inv-mxi-spa-t3ss family named after the inv-spa system of salmonella enterica and the inv-mxi t3s system of shigella spp. the family members trigger bacterial uptake by nonphagocytic cells. the hrc-hrp1- and  the hrc-hrp2-t3ss families are present in plant pathogenic bacteria of the genus pseudomonas, erwinia, ralstonia and xanthomonas. the two families are differentiated on the basis of their genetic loci organization and regulatory systems.  the rhizobiales-t3ss family  is dedicated to the intimate endosymbiosis serving nitrogen fixation in the roots of leguminous plants.  finally the chlamydiales-t3ss is present only in these strictly intracellular nonproteobacteria pathogens  <cit> . the phylogenetic trees obtained by the above analysis were totally incongruent with the evolutionary tree of bacteria based on 16s rrna sequences. these results imply that t3s systems did not originate within their present host bacteria, but spread through horizontal gene transfer events  <cit> . furthermore, apart from a high degree of gene homologies within the t3ss families, the overall genetic organization  is also conserved  <cit> .

in this study, we present a detailed phylogenetic and gene synteny analysis of core t3ss proteins. this analysis reveals the presence of three distinct rhc-t3ss family subgroups. from these subgroups, the one designated as subgroup ii was found to comprise t3s systems from various pseudomonas syringae strains as well as from rhizobium sp. ngr <dig>  the t3ss of subgroup ii will be hereafter referred to as t3ss- <dig>  because these systems exist in their bacterial hosts next to the well-studied t3ss from the pngr234a plasmid of rhizobium sp. and the hrc1-hrp <dig> t3s system of p. syringae. interestingly, at least two of the genes from the additional t3ss- <dig> gene cluster in p. syringae pv phaseolicola strain 1448a were found to be transcriptionally active.

methods
sequence analysis
genomic regions
the regions comprising and surrounding the t3ss- <dig> gene clusters of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, p. syringae pv oryzae str. 1_ <dig>  p. syringae pv tabaci atcc <dig>  rhizobium spp. ngr <dig> and the regions comprising and surrounding the unique t3ss gene clusters of bradyrhizobium japonicum usda  <dig>  rhizobium etli ciat  <dig> and r. etli cnf  <dig> were retrieved from the ncbi genome database. in the cases of p. syringae pv tabaci atcc <dig> and p. syringae pv aesculi the nucleotide sequence in the region close to the t3ss gene cluster was retrieved  after being identified through megablast searches and found to be present in p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, but absent from p. syringae pv tomato dc <dig> and pseudomonas syringae pv syringae b728a; coding sequences were identified with ncbi’s orf finder tool.

amino acid sequence analysis
each coding sequence annotated in the t3ss gene clusters of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, r. etli ciat  <dig> and rhizobium spp. ngr <dig> was analyzed by psi-blast searches  <cit>  against the ncbi non-redundant database reduced for bacteria using the following parameters: blosum  <dig> substitution matrix; expected threshold 10; word size 3; gap costs: existence:  <dig>  extension 1; the filter for low complexity regions was set to on. the number of descriptions and alignments to be reported was set to  <dig> and conditional compositional adjustments were on. the program foldindex© was used with default parameters for the prediction of structural disorder propensity from the amino acid sequences  <cit> . secondary structure predictions were performed with psipred  <cit> . physical and chemical parameters of sequences under study were estimated by protparam  <cit> . coiled coil predictions and assignment of the heptad repeat positions in proteins were produced in coils  <cit>  and matcher  <cit>  respectively. sequence threading techniques and fold-recognition algorithms were used to identify distant homologs. 3-d structural profiles for t3ss proteins were predicted from sequence data was performed using the phyre pipeline  <cit> . the program memstat <dig>  <cit>  was used for the prediction of membrane α-helices in proteins.

nucleotide sequence analysis
the gene synteny of the t3ss- <dig> clusters of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, p. syringae pv oryzae str. 1_ <dig>  p. syringae pv tabaci atcc <dig>  rhizobium spp. ngr <dig> and the gene synteny of the unique t3ss gene clusters of b. japonicum usda  <dig>  r. etli ciat  <dig>  r. etli cnf  <dig>  were compared to other known t3ss gene clusters of various bacteria using the blastn and blastp tools of the genbank. codon usage bias analysis was performed using dnasp v <dig>  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
t3ss core protein sequences were retrieved using psi-blast searches with the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a t3ss- <dig> gene cluster coding frames and were aligned with the multiple alignment method clustalw, version  <dig>   <cit> .

phylogenetic relations were inferred using the neighbour-joining method  <cit>  implemented in the mega <dig> software  <cit> . the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from  <dig> replicates  <cit>  is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the amino acid sequences analyzed  <cit> . branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  are shown next to the branches  <cit> . the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. the evolutionary distances were computed using the poisson correction method  <cit>  and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. all positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pair wise sequence comparisons.

cultivation
p. syringae strains were routinely grown at 28°c in lb medium. bacteria of overnight culture were collected at an od  of  <dig> . the bacterial pellet was washed with 10 mm mgcl <dig> and the cells were resuspended  in hrp-induction media  <cit>  for overnight cultivation at 28°c. the next day the bacterial cells were collected  for rna extraction.

rt-pcr
for the rt-pcr reactions, total rna was extracted from overnight bacterial cultures of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a and p. syringae pv tomato dc <dig>  using both lb and hrp-induction media  <cit> . total rna was treated with rnase-free dnase i for 45 min at 37°c  <cit> . from both culture conditions equal amounts of the extracted total rna were subjected to rt-pcr with gene specific primers for the pspph_ <dig>  pspph_ <dig> and 16s rdna genes, using the onestep rt-pcr kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . for negative control, pcr was performed on the total rna without reverse transcriptase assay, using the 16s rdna primers, in order to accredit no dna contamination in the total rna isolation samples. the rt-pcr products were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. primers sequences for 16s rna were 5′-cgggtacttgtacctggtggc-3′ and 5′-cttgccagttttggatgcagttc-3′, for pspph_ <dig> were 5′-aggccctgacgacgctgctg-3′ and 5′-ccaggtgcctgtgttcggcagt-3′ and for pspph_ <dig> 5′-tcctgctgtgcctgttatccggcg-3′ and 5′-gacggtcggtagcgacttgagtgac-3′.

RESULTS
analysis of core components of p. syringae t3ss- <dig> and the rhc-t3ss family
phylogenetic analysis of core proteins
in the subsequent sections the unified nomenclature for t3ss proteins  will be followed  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of various t3ss core proteins , e.g. sctu , sctv , sctq  and the t3ss atpases sctn , confirmed the broad classification of the non-flagellar t3ss into seven families. however, the t3ss- <dig> proteins were grouped in the same clade with the rhc t3ss proteins with high bootstrap values, suggesting that these lineages share a more recent common origin than with other t3ss families.

shaded boxes are indicative of proteins with analog function but no sequence homology to the ysc t3ss family. double names are also reported for various cases.

interestingly, the rhc t3ss family can be further subdivided into three subgroups: subgroup i is represented by the well-known t3sss of rhizobium sp. ngr <dig>  and b. japonicum usda  <dig> while subgroup iii is represented by the t3ss present in r. etli. proteins from the t3ss- <dig> system of various p. syringae strains are grouped closer to the t3ss- <dig> of rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> , forming the subgroup ii of the rhc t3ss family.

all required core t3ss components are present in the t3ss- of p. syringae strains
blastp and psi-blast searches revealed the main t3ss components of the novel t3ss- <dig> gene cluster of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a which are also conserved in p. syringae pv oryzae str. 1_ <dig>  p. syringae pv tabaci atcc <dig>  and p. syringae pv aesculi. similar searches and comparisons were also carried out with the t3sss of r. etli cnf  <dig>  r. etli ciat  <dig> and rhizobium sp. strain ngr <dig>  in the following, the prefix hrcii will be used to specify the conserved t3ss- <dig> proteins of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, p. syringae pv oryzae str. 1_ <dig> and p. syringae pv tabaci, while the prefix rhcii will be used to distinguish the rhc proteins of the t3ss- <dig> gene cluster found in plasmid pngr234b of rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> . the t3ss protein nomenclature when used is indicated by the prefix sct according to table  <dig> 

all major t3ss core proteins were found in the t3ss gene clusters mentioned above, including the t3ss atpase protein sctn , its negative regulator sctl , the two t3ss gate proteins sctu and sctv , the protein building the inner ring of the t3ss basal body sctj , the protein building the cytoplasmic ring sctq  and the three core membrane proteins sctr, scts, sctt  .

it is noteworthy that the promoter regions of the t3ss- <dig> orfs/operons of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, do not appear to harbor "hrp box" elements like those which have been described for the t3ss- <dig> genes of various p. syringae strains  <cit> . this, coupled with the low expression level seen in minimal media , leave open the question whether t3ss- <dig> in this or other p. syringae strains is expressed under in planta conditions and whether it is plays a role in their phytopathogenic potential or in any other aspect of their life cycle.

the split secretin gene
a distinguishing feature of gene organization in rhc t3ss clusters is a split gene coding for the outer membrane secretin protein sctc, i.e. a hrcc/yscc homologue  <cit> . this is also true for the subgroup ii rhc t3ss gene clusters. in the t3ss- <dig> clusters of the three p. syringae pathovars the secretin gene is split in two orfs . in p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, loci pspph_ <dig>  and pspph_ <dig>  code for the n-terminal and the c-terminal part of secretin, respectively, of a hrcc/yscc homolog. comparisons of hrciic <dig> and hrciic <dig> with the rhcc <dig> and rhc <dig> proteins of rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> are given in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  respectively. a similar situation occurs in p. syringae pv oryzae str. 1_ <dig> while in p. syringae pv tabaci atcc <dig> hrciic <dig> gene is further split into two parts. however in p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a and p. syringae pv tabaci atcc <dig> the two hrciic <dig>  hrciic <dig> genes are only separated by an opposite facing orf coding for a tpr-protein, while in the subgroup i rhc t3ss these two genes are separated even further . although the functional significance of the split secretin gene is not known, there are reports of constitutive expression of the rhcc <dig> gene in contrast to the rest of the t3ss operons in rhizobia  <cit> . in subgroup iii only the rhcc <dig> could be identified  in psi-blast searches using the hrcΙΙc <dig> protein sequence as query  .

the hrciiq protein
the pspph_ <dig> locus  in the t3ss- <dig> cluster of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a codes for a polypeptide chain of  <dig> residues, which has sequence similarities with members of the hrcq/yscq/fliy family. members of this family usually consist of two autonomous regions  <cit>  which either are organized as two domains of a single protein or can be split up into two polypeptide chains. the hrciiq is comparable in length with the long proteins of the family. the same is true in the rhc-t3ss case, where an hrcq ortholog is found. in agreement with the other hrcq/yscq/fliy members the sequence conservation is especially high at the c-terminus  <cit> . in the originally described t3ss- <dig>  of p. syringae strains this gene is split into two adjacent orfs coding for separate polypeptides . no splitting occurs however in the t3ss- <dig> clusters of the p. syringae strains.

the hrpo-like protein
a conserved feature in gene organization of t3ss gene clusters and the flagellum is the presence of a small orf downstream of the gene coding for the atpase . these orfs code for proteins of the hrpo/ysco/flij family, a diverse group characterized by low sequence similarity, and heptad repeat motifs suggesting a high tendency for coiled-coil formation and a propensity for structural disorder  <cit> . such a gene is also present in the rhizobium ngr <dig> t3ss- <dig> but is absent from the subgroup iii rhc-t3ss where the rhcq gene is immediately downstream of the rhcn gene . in the p. syringae pathovars included in figure  <dig> there is a small orf  coding for a polypeptide wrongly annotated as myosin heavy chain b  in the ncbi protein database. sequence analysis of this protein and its homologs in the other two p. syringae strains using blastp searches did not reveal any significant similarities to other proteins. however, these small proteins are predicted as unfolded in their entire length, while heptad repeat patterns are recognizable in the largest part of their sequence, thus strongly resembling the properties of members of the hrpo/ysco/flij family  <cit> , . a potentially important feature in the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a t3ss- <dig> cluster is a predicted transposase gene between the orf coding for the above described hrpo/ysco/flij family member and the orf for the hrciin atpase ; this gene is absent from the p. syringae pv tabaci and p. syringae pv oryzae str.1_ <dig> t3ss- <dig> clusters. the insertion of the transposase gene does not disrupt genes hrciin or hrpiio as concluded by amino acid sequence comparison with other members of the sctn and scto protein families respectively . these genes are capable of producing the respective full-length proteins and no premature termination, due to transposase insertion, is observed.

the hrpq-like protein
another common feature of p. syringae t3ss- <dig> and the rhizobium t3sss excluding subgroup iii, is a gene usually positioned upstream of the sctv gene  and in close proximity to it. psi-blast searches for the pspph_ <dig> encoded protein revealed moderate similarities to the hrpq/yscd family of t3ss proteins; these were confirmed by sequence threading techniques. for example, a segment of of pspph_ <dig> corresponding to 45% of its amino acid sequence scores an e-value of 2e- <dig> and a 26% identity with yscd protein from yersinia enterocolitica ; the same segment scores an e-value of 1e- <dig> with 25% identity to the 90% of its sequence with the equivalent protein from b. japonicum usda <dig> . the chosen folding templates belong to various forkhead - associated  protein domains from different origins. fha cytoplasmic domains characterize the yscd/escd protein family and may suggest phosphopeptide recognition interactions  <cit> . a protein with the above characteristics is present in the b. japonicum usda <dig> t3ss cluster  while an ortholog could not be identified in the r. etli t3ss.

gene clusters organization in the rhc-t3ss family and the p. syringae t3ss-2
subgroup i of the rhc-t3ss family comprises the first described and well characterized t3ss- <dig> of rhizobium ngr <dig> present in the plasmid pngr234a  <cit> , along with that of b. japonicum usda <dig> and others  <cit> . the t3ss core genes in this case are organized in three segments. the biggest segment harbors the genes rhcu, rhct, rhcs, rhcr, rhcq, y4yj, rhcn, nolv, nolu, rhcj, nolb, in the same dna strand with the rhcc <dig> gene flanking the nolb gene in the opposite strand . the second one harbors the rhcv gene usually between the y4ys and y4yq genes, all in the same orientation. in the case of the b. japonicum usda <dig> however there are two additional open reading frames  between the rhcv and the y4yq gene in the same orientation . the third segment harbors the rhcc <dig> gene usually between the y4xi and the y4xk genes.

subgroup iii of the rhc-t3ss family includes the t3ss of r. etli strains ciat <dig>  and cnf <dig>   <cit> . the gene organization is very different from that of subgroup i in that there is no rhcc <dig> gene, while the rhcv gene is in close proximity to the biggest segment. in the biggest segment the genes y4yj  and nolb are missing. additional genes present in the subgroup iii are coding for a hrpk-like protein  and a hrpw-like protein.

gene clusters of subgroup ii of the rhc t3ss family, represented by the the t3ss- <dig> of rhizobium ngr <dig>   <cit>  and the recently identified t3ss- <dig> gene clusters of the p. syringae, possesses various characteristics that classify them as intermediates between the t3ss subgroups i and iii. on one hand, subgroup ii clusters share the scto, sctd and sctc <dig> genes with subgroup i clusters and but not with subgroup iii; on the other hand, some subgroup ii clusters posses putative translocator genes present in subgroup iii, but absent from subgroup i.

the t3ss- <dig> clusters of the p. syringae strains are essentially syntenic, with the exceptions of an is element  being present between the hrciin and hrpiio coding frames in the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a cluster and the absence of a tpr  protein coding frame in the p. syringae pv oryzae str.1_ <dig> cluster. the rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> pngr234b-plasmid borne cluster has two extended regions of synteny with those of the p. syringae strains. one is the region from hrciic <dig> to hrciit, . the other is the region from hrpiiq to pspph_ <dig> which, however, is inverted in the rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> pngr234b t3ss cluster relative to those in the pseudomonads. the coding frame for the rhcu/hrcu/yscu/fhlb homolog in the ngr <dig> cluster is transposed in relation to the pseudomonas cluster . in subgroup ii of rhc-t3ss gene clusters an hrciic <dig> gene can be identified in synteny to the subgroup i cluster. a common property of subgroups ii and iii of rhc-t3ss gene clusters is the presence of hrpk-like genes.

common to all rhc-t3ss subgroups is the absence of a hrpp/yscp –like gene which usually resides between the hrpo/ysco-like gene and the hrcq/yscq homolog gene. a hrpo/ysco-like gene is absent from the subgroup iii cluster. subgroup i and iii clusters maintain synteny with the p. syringae t3ss- <dig> clusters for most of the core t3ss orfs. finally, a gene coding for a hrpw homolog is found only in the r. etli clusters.

non-conserved t3ss proteins
the translocator of the p. syringae t3ss-2
a common feature of the r. etli rhc t3ss  and the t3ss- <dig> of p. syringae pathovars  is the presence of an orf coding for a hypothetical translocator protein: the pspph_ <dig> locus of the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a t3ss- <dig> codes for a large protein of  <dig> residues. the c-terminal part of this protein  is homologous to the hrpk proteins of the hrc-hrp <dig> t3ss family based on psi-blast searches . hrpk shares low similarity with the putative translocator, hrpf, from xantomonas campestris pv vesicatoria. furthermore, the c-terminal part of the protein coded by pspph_ <dig> also possesses two predicted transmembrane α-helices comprising residues 879– <dig> and 1029– <dig> . the subgroup i rhc t3ss lacks a hrpk ortholog. the hrpk protein was initially identified as a component of the hrc-hrp <dig> family of t3s systems  <cit> . interestingly, the r. etli t3ss gene cluster possesses two copies of hrpk-like genes, plus an additional hrpw-like gene, coding for an hrp-secreted protein homologous to class iii pectate lyases which is absent from the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a t3ss- <dig> gene cluster but present in the extremity of the hrc-hrp <dig> gene cluster of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a. these differences possibly suggest variations in the mode of interaction of these bacteria with their hosts.

the two unknown orfs upstream of the rhcv gene in subgroup ii rhc-t3ss gene clusters
the choice of the b. japonicum usda  <dig> t3ss as archetypal for subgroup i in the rhc family  and for synteny comparisons with the subgroup ii gene clusters, was based on the dna segment encompassing rhcv . the presence of two small open reading frames upstream of the rhcv gene and downstream of the y4yq gene of the known rhizobium t3ss resembled the case of the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a t3ss- <dig> where loci pspph_ <dig> and pspph_ <dig> are found between the orf coding for the sctv protein  and the orf coding for the sctd protein .

the pspph_ <dig> locus, upstream of the hrciiv gene of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a genome, encodes for a  <dig> long polypeptide with sequence similarities to the vscy protein of vibrio parahaemolyticus, according to psi-blast searches . the vscy gene is located upstream of the vcrd gene and this synteny is also conserved in the ysc t3ss gene cluster family. proteins yscy, vscy and pspph_ <dig> all possess tpr repeats  as predicted by psi-blast searches and fold recognition methods. yscy has been found to directly bind the yscx protein, a secreted component of the ysc t3ss  <cit> . the bll <dig> locus of b. japonicum usda <dig> encodes for a  <dig> long polypeptide with tpr repeats and sequence similarities to the ascy  and yscy proteins according to psi-blast searches. the position of bll <dig> is likewise upstream of the rhcv gene in b. japonicum usda <dig> t3ss gene cluster. a protein with the above characteristics could not be identified for the r. etli t3ss , however it is present in the t3ss- <dig> of rhizobium ngr <dig> 

transcription regulators in p. syringae t3ss-2
the hrc-hrp <dig> and the rhc t3s  systems possess transcription regulators that belong to the arac/xyls in contrast to the hrc-hrp <dig> t3ss that depends on the alternative sigma factor hrpl. the known transcription factors are related to the t3ss regulation of arac and luxr/uhap families of transcription regulators and characterized by two α-helix-turn-α-helix  motifs in a tetrahelical bundle.

however, the pspph_ <dig> locus of p. syringae t3ss- <dig> codes for a hypothetical transcription regulator with different characteristics. the n-terminal part of the hypothetical protein  is predicted to adopt a structure similar to the dna-binding domains of the phob transcription factor. the characteristic hth motif is a common feature of transcription factors. although the pspph_ <dig> orf is annotated in the ncbi as a luxr-type of transcription regulator, the choice of the dna-binding domain of phob as a structural template indicates that pspph_ <dig> probably has an α-/β- doubly wound fold  motif. transcription factors are usually multidomain proteins, thus the assignment of pspph_ <dig> as a luxr-type transcription regulator in the ncbi is probably due to full-length inadequate psi-blast searches biased by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeats  in the large carboxyterminal domain.

the middle part of the protein  was found homologous to the aaa+ atpases  based on fold-recognition algorithms and psi-blast searches. these atpases are associated with diverse cellular activities and are able to induce conformational changes in their targets  <cit> . in the context of the transcription process, aaa+ atpase domains are involved in the remodeling of σ <dig> rna polymerases. especially the residues  <dig> to  <dig> probably possess the receiver or ligand binding domain of the hypothetical transcription factor .

tpr-repeats proteins present in p. syringae t3ss-2
apart from the pspph_ <dig> c-terminal domain, there are two more orfs, pspph_ <dig> and pspph_ <dig>  from the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a t3ss- <dig> that are predicted to code for proteins that possess tpr domains. tpr domains are typically found in class ii chaperones of t3s systems - chaperones of the translocators - as well as in transcriptional regulators of the t3s systems, e.g. the hrpb protein of ralstonia solanacearum, hila of salmonella enterica <cit>  and sica, of salmonella typhimurium involved in the activations of t3ss virulence genes  <cit> . proteins with tpr repeats also exist in the hrc-hrp <dig> t3s system of x. campestris  and in the t3s system of rhizobia . on the other hand, the hrc-hrp <dig> system of p. syringae does not possess proteins with tpr repeats.

dna characteristics of the p. syringae t3ss- <dig> gene cluster
the t3ss- <dig> cluster of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a is separated by  <dig>  mb from the well-characterized hrc-hrp <dig> t3ss cluster in the main chromosome. both clusters are located on dna segments with gc content similar to their neighbouring areas. no sequences associated with hrpl-responsive promoters  were found in the t3ss- <dig> gene cluster  <cit>  indicating a different way of regulation from the hrc-hrp <dig> system. the orf pspph_ <dig> that resides between the core genes and the hrpk homolog pspph_ <dig>  codes for a hypothetical transcription regulator . no trna genes, however, have been found in the vicinity of this cluster, while two insertion sequence  elements occur in the border and in the middle region of the t3ss- <dig> gene cluster .

the gc content of the t3ss- <dig> cluster in the p. syringae strains is close to the chromosome average , which might suggest that it has been resident in the p. syringae’s genome for a long time  <cit> . the codon usage indexes  of the t3ss- <dig> cluster show the same degree of codon usage bias as the hrc-hrp <dig> t3ss cluster of p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a. furthermore, the gc content in the third coding position  of various genes across the t3ss- <dig> is close to the respective mean of the genome gc <dig>  as in the case of hrc-hrp <dig> . these equal gc levels could indicate an ancient acquisition of the t3ss- <dig> gene cluster by p. syringae that was lost in some of its strains. however the scenario of a more recent acquisition from a hypothetical donor with equal gc levels can not be excluded.

evidence for expression of the p. syringae t3ss-2
there are no reports so far for the expression or function of t3ss- <dig> in members of p. syringae. to obtain preliminary expression evidence of functional putative rna transcripts, the hrciin  and hrciic <dig>  from p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a were detected by rt-pcr in total rna extracts from cultures grown in rich  and minimal  media, after exhaustive treatment with rnase-free dnase i . putative transcripts were detected under both growth conditions that were tested, using equal amounts of the extracted total rna as an rt-pcr template. interestingly, the detected transcript levels were remarkably higher in lb medium , compared to minimal  medium, probably indicating that the genes are expressed in both cultivation conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
rhizobia are α-proteobacteria that are able to induce the formation of nodules on leguminous plant roots, where nitrogen fixation takes place with t3ss being one important determinant of this symbiosis  <cit> . sequences of the symbiotic plasmids of rhizobium strains ngr <dig> and r. etli cfn <dig> together with the chromosomal symbiotic regions of b. japonicum usda <dig> and mesorhizobium loti r7a have been recently reported  <cit> . an unusual feature of the rhizobium strains ngr <dig>  <cit> , is the presence of an additional t3ss gene cluster.

members of the p. syringae species are gram negative plant-associated γ-proteobacteria that can exist both as harmless epiphytes and as pathogens of major agricultural crops  <cit> . pathogenic varieties of this species utilize a hrc-hrp <dig> t3ss to inject effector proteins and thus subvert signalling pathways of their plant hosts. this secretion system  and its effector proteins are responsible for the development of the characteristic disease symptoms on susceptible plants and the triggering of the hypersensitive response  in resistant plants  <cit> .

comparative genomics of closely related isolates or species of pathogenic bacteria provides a powerful tool for rapid identification of genes involved in host specificity and virulence  <cit> . in this work, we reported sequence similarity searches, phylogeny analysis and prediction of the physicochemical characteristics of the hypothetical t3ss- <dig> proteins, as well as gene synteny analysis of the t3ss- <dig> gene cluster in p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, p. syringae pv oryzae str. 1_ <dig> and p. syringae pv tabaci atcc <dig> in order to characterize this recently identified gene cluster. this analysis revealed that the t3ss- <dig> most closely resembles the t3ss of the rhc-t3ss family. it further typifies a second discrete subfamily  within the rhc-t3ss family in addition to the ones represented by the r. etli t3ss  and the known rhizobium-t3ss . usually, the presence of two t3ss gene clusters in the same genome is not the result of gene duplication inside the species but rather the result of independent horizontal gene transfers. this may reflect progressive coevolution of the plant patho/symbio-system to either colonize various hosts or interact with the plant in different disease/symbiotic stages.

in our phylogenetic analysis proteins encoded in the t3ss- <dig> cluster of p. syringae strains are grouped together with the rhizobium ngr <dig> t3ss- <dig>  this finding suggests the possibility of an ancient acquisition from a common ancestor for rhizobium ngr <dig> t3ss- <dig> and the p. syringae t3ss- <dig>  t3sss of the rhizobium family possesses a gc-content in same range , a value lower than the chromosome average. since the gc content of t3ss- <dig> is almost the same as that of the genome of the p. syringae strains, it is difficult to characterize the second t3ss gene cluster as a genomic island based solely on this criterion. however, the genome sequencing of two other members of p. syringae  revealed the total absence of a t3ss- <dig> like cluster.

the t3ss- <dig> gene cluster found in p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, p. syringae pv oryzae str.1_ <dig>  p. syringae pv tabaci and of rhizobium sp. ngr <dig>  is also present in p. syringae pv aesculi  <cit> , p. syringae pv savastanoi   <cit> , p. syringae pv glycinea   <cit> , p. syringae pv lachrymans str. m <dig> , p. syringae pv actinidiae str. m <dig> , p. syringae pv. morsprunorum str. m302280pt  and p. syringae cit  <dig> . this t3ss- <dig> defines a distinct lineage in the rhc t3ss family of at least the same evolutionary age as the split between the ngr <dig> t3ss- <dig> from the other rhizobial t3sss.

in light of these findings, there are two plausible scenarios. one is that p. syringae acquired the t3ss- <dig> cluster from an ancient donor which is common both to p. syringae and the rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> t3ss- <dig>  before the diversification of the p. syringae pathovars from each other, followed by subsequent loss from certain members of the group. another scenario is that multiple horizontal transfers from hypothetical donors into selected pathovars/strains occurred after their diversification. the present data set does not allow us to consider whether the hypothesis of an earlier acquisition followed by subsequent loss from members such as p. syringae pv tomato dc <dig> might be considered more likely than several independent acquisitions.

the genes hrciin and hrciiv in p. syringae pv tabaci and p. syringae pv oryzae t3ss- <dig> clusters were split into at least two open reading frames in various positions suggesting possibly that they might be degenerate pseudogenes, while the hrciic <dig> gene in p. syringae pv tabaci is further split in two orfs as well . however, this is not the case for the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a, p. syringae pv savastanoi and p. syringae pv aesculi t3ss- <dig> where all these genes remain intact while hrciic <dig> and hrciin transcripts were observed in p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a t3ss- <dig> case . remarkably, the t3ss- <dig> genes expression was even higher in rich compared to minimal medium . minimal media of slightly acidic ph are thought to simulate in planta conditions and promote expression of the p. syringae t3ss- <dig> and effectors  <cit> . such genes typically possess conserved motifs  in their promoter regions and are transcriptionally controlled by the alternative sigma factor hrpl. however, the t3ss- <dig> operons in the p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a genome do not appear to have hrp boxes like those found in t3ss- <dig> genes of p. syringae strains  <cit> . this suggests that psph 1448a does restrict t3ss- <dig> expression to in planta conditions and the potential contribution of the t3ss- <dig> in p. syringae life cycle may not be connected with the phytopathogenic potential of this species. further functional studies are thus needed to reveal the exact biological roles of this secretion system in bacterium-plant interactions or other aspects of the bacterial life cycle. suppression of other secretion systems under the t3ss- <dig> inducing conditions has also been reported for the t6ss of p. syringae pv syringae b728a  <cit>  as well as for the p. aeruginosa t3ss  <cit> , which do not appear to play a role in plant pathogenesis  <cit> .

gene transfer between phylogenetically remote bacteria would be favored by colonization of the same environmental niche  <cit> . in nature, rhizobium is normally viewed as a microbe that survives saprophytically in soil, in nitrogen fixing nodules of legumes or as endophytes in gramineous plants, for example field grown  <cit>  and wild rice  <cit> . p. syringae pv phaseolicola 1448a and p. syringae pv oryzae str.1_ <dig> are pathogens of the common bean and rice, respectively, while rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> forms nitrogen fixing nodules with more legumes than any other microsymbiont  <cit> . thus, there is ample opportunity for niche overlap between at least one of the p. syringae pathovars possessing t3ss- <dig> and rhizobium sp. ngr <dig>  at this point, a role for t3ss- <dig> in host-bacterium interactions for the rhizobia or the p. syringae strains possessing the system remains to be established and it is not obvious why these bacteria maintain a second t3ss gene cluster in their genome. functional analysis and genome sequencing of more rhizobia that share common niches with p. syringae as well as the sequencing of more p. syringae pathovar genomes may shed light into these questions.
