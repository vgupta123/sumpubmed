BACKGROUND
antibiotic resistance is a serious threat to human and animal health and new ways to combat it are urgently needed. broad-host range plasmids, such as those belonging to the incn and incp <dig> groups are important to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance due to their ability to replicate in a variety clinically relevant bacterial species and environments  <cit> . indeed, both incn and incp <dig> group plasmids have been shown to encode clinically important resistance determinants such as blactx-m, blaimp, blandm, blavim and qnr  <cit> , whilst incn plasmids have also been strongly implicated in the recent spread of blakpc encoded carbapenemases  <cit> .

antimicrobial resistance can sometimes be accompanied by a reduction in biological fitness in the absence of antibiotic selection. hence, less fit resistant bacteria may be outcompeted and displaced by fitter, susceptible bacteria in the absence of antibiotic use, leading to the suggestion that it may be possible to reduce the prevalence of antibiotic resistance by temporarily restricting prescribing. in practice, however, such approaches have enjoyed mixed success  <cit> .

a fitness cost of antibiotic resistance has often been demonstrated in the case of chromosomal mutations conferring resistance, for example in the case of fusa mutations conferring resistance to fusidic acid  <cit>  and gyra mutations conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones  <cit> . however, compensatory mutations can arise at secondary sites that reduce or eliminate this cost  <cit> . in the case of acquired antibiotic resistance genes encoded on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and transposons, the existence of a fitness cost is less clear. while early studies which often investigated cloning plasmids and/or laboratory strains demonstrated a cost to plasmid carriage  <cit> , some more recent data using naturally-occurring plasmids and/or wild-type bacteria have failed to demonstrate significant costs and have sometimes shown a benefit. for example, the small sulphonamide and streptomycin resistance plasmid p <dig> confers a 4% per generation fitness benefit in e. coli  <cit> , and a benefit has also been demonstrated for some apramycin resistance plasmids isolated from bovine e. coli  <cit> . a number of antibiotic resistance encoding plasmids and transposons conferred only a low fitness cost or were cost-neutral in the wild-type e. coli strain 345-2rifc in vitro and in the pig gut  <cit> , whilst the resistance plasmid r <dig> and variants of it enhanced fitness under some growth conditions in e. coli  <cit> . it is likely that the fitness cost a particular plasmid exerts on its host is variable depending on the plasmid as well as on the host itself. however, few studies have examined the fitness cost of a single plasmid on different strains of bacteria. the genetic factors, be they plasmid or host-encoded, that influence fitness are poorly understood, and it is not known whether related plasmids influence fitness in similar ways.

there are theoretically three ways in which a bacterial host can counteract the potential fitness cost exerted by antibiotic resistance genes carried on mobile genetic elements; the first is to acquire compensatory mutations, while the second is outright loss of the mobile genetic element. a third possibility is that bacteria could switch off the expression of resistance genes when they are not required whilst retaining the genes themselves in order to lower costs. we have previously demonstrated silencing of antibiotic resistance genes carried on the broad-host range plasmids pve <dig> and rp <dig> by the wild-type e. coli strain 345-2rifc  <cit> . following passage through the pig gut, a small proportion  of 345-2rifc colonies recovered lost expression of one or more of the four resistance genes encoded on the plasmid. such isolates had retained the pve <dig> plasmid and in most cases, intact, wild-type resistance genes and promoters were present, but no resistance gene mrna was expressed. similar results were found for three colonies of 345-2rifc that also lost resistance following passage through the pig gut. antibiotic resistance gene silencing appears to be restricted to only the plasmid with minimal effect on the remainder of the genome and is thought to be due to a mutation on the chromosome of e. coli 345-2rifc  <cit> . its precise mechanism is yet to be elucidated.

here, we examine several unexplored questions regarding the fitness impact of broad host range incp and incn plasmids on their hosts; namely, the effect of the host background on fitness, whether related plasmids have similar fitness impacts and the fitness impact of antimicrobial resistance gene. to facilitate this task we also report the complete nucleotide sequence of the incn plasmid n <dig> 

RESULTS
the effect of host background on plasmid fitness impact
the effect of host genetic background on the fitness impact of plasmid rp <dig> in the laboratory was investigated . five unrelated host strains representing all four e. coli phylogenetic groups were studied; e. coli 345-2rifc  and 343- <dig>  of porcine origin, 99- <dig>  and 99- <dig>  of human clinical origin  and k <dig>  jm <dig>  a laboratory strain. phylogenetic group b <dig>  and to a lesser extent phylogenetic group d tend to be associated with extra-intestinal infections, whereas strains belonging to groups a and b <dig> are often commensals  <cit> . there was considerable variation in the results obtained from different host backgrounds. the fitness impacts of rp <dig> on the strains of animal origin  were significantly lower than the costs imposed on those of human origin  .

these results suggest that the fitness impact a particular antibiotic resistance plasmid confers on a given bacterial species is dependent on the genotype of the specific host strain that it is in. this conclusion is perhaps intuitive, but has to the best of our knowledge not been demonstrated for antibiotic resistance-encoding plasmids. one might expect this to be the case based on previous work by dahlberg and chao, who showed that amelioration of fitness costs conferred by the plasmids r <dig> and rp <dig>  on e. coli k <dig> j <dig> depended on genetic changes in the host chromosome, thus implying a host genome component is involved in determining plasmid-encoded fitness cost  <cit> . similarly, the fitness cost and stability of the plasmid pb <dig> was highly variable in strains of different species  <cit> . previous studies have also shown that target mutations leading to antibiotic resistance, for example gyra mutations in campylobacter jejuni or 23s rrna mutations leading to clarithromycin resistance in helicobacter pylori have different fitness effects in different host backgrounds  <cit> . it is not currently known which host genetic components may be important for determining the effect a plasmid will have on host fitness and it is likely that these will vary depending on the host-plasmid combination concerned. this finding has important implications for anyone wishing to use fitness cost as a parameter to model the spread or decline of a given plasmid in a bacterial population, perhaps in response to changes in antimicrobial selection, as it highlights the need to determine fitness in several different host genetic backgrounds. similarly, recent work has also shown that fitness cost of antimicrobial resistance is variable depending on the growth conditions used in laboratory measurements  <cit> , re-iterating the need for multiple measurements to obtain accurate fitness cost estimates.

dna sequence analysis of n3
despite being a well-studied archetypal plasmid isolated in the 1960s, the dna sequence of the incn plasmid n <dig> has not previously been reported  <cit> . sequence analysis revealed that it is  <dig>  <dig> bp in length, has a gc content of  <dig> % and encodes  <dig> putative open reading frames . it shares a common backbone with other incn plasmids such as r <dig>  <cit>  and the recently described multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid pkox <dig>  <cit>  . the shared region comprises the plasmid's replication and transfer functions as well as genes encoding stable inheritance, anti-restriction and uv protection functions. n <dig> also encodes a class  <dig> integron and, in common with pkox <dig> but lacking from r <dig>  a type  <dig> restriction modification system. this characteristic and the high sequence identity shown between a number of proteins encoded by the two plasmids suggests pkox <dig> may have evolved from a n3-like ancestor. n <dig> also encodes a unique region absent from other known incn plasmids, bordered by is <dig> elements. this comprises the tet genes for tetracycline resistance, a putative baca-like bacitracin resistance gene and seven novel genes. several of the novel genes are predicted to have metabolic functions, most likely amino acid metabolism. outside this region, the high similarity between n <dig> and other antibiotic resistance encoding incn plasmids suggests that they have evolved from a common ancestor and diverged from each other relatively recently. the resistance region appears to have originated as a single class  <dig> integron initially carrying only an aada <dig> cassette which has subsequently acquired further cassettes and/or insertions.

the effect of the genetic composition of the plasmid on its fitness impact
the fitness impacts of the related plasmids rp <dig> and pub <dig> and r <dig> and n <dig> on e. coli 345-2rifc were compared. pub <dig> is a derivative of rp <dig> which has lost the tn <dig> transposon. the fitness impact of the tn <dig> transposon itself has been demonstrated to be variable depending on the insertion site, with some insertion sites conferring a fitness benefit  <cit> . here, pub <dig> had a small fitness cost of  <dig>  Â±  <dig> % per generation, significantly lower than that of rp <dig> of - <dig>  Â±  <dig> % per generation . in animals, carriage of neither rpi nor pub <dig> influenced the ability of e. coli 345-2rifc to colonize the pig gut compared to the plasmid-free 345-2rifc .

r <dig> was previously determined to confer a fitness cost of -  <dig>  Â±  <dig> % per generation  <cit>  in the laboratory, whilst no significant fitness cost in pigs was detected. in contrast, here, n <dig> was demonstrated to have a significantly higher fitness cost in the laboratory of  <dig>  Â±  <dig> % per generation . in animals, 345-2rifc/n <dig> colonised the pig gut significantly worse than the plasmid free strain or 345-2rifc/r <dig> .

in the case of rp <dig> versus pub <dig>  these results suggest that the lower fitness cost of pub <dig> compared to rp <dig> is related to the presence of less dna. it is known that in single copy the tn <dig> transposon does not itself have a detrimental effect on host fitness and can occasionally confer a benefit depending on the insertion site  <cit> . therefore, it can be assumed that in this case the advantage gained by deletion of tn <dig> is due to the presence of less dna and a lowered burden of gene expression as the tem beta-lactamase encoded by the transposon is normally expressed at high levels. as rp <dig> is present in multiple copies, the burden of gene expression will be higher on the plasmid than in the case of tn <dig> insertion at a single chromosomal site. possible additional epistatic fitness effects due to the insertion site of tn <dig> in rp <dig> will also be absent in pub <dig> 

the reason why n <dig> and r <dig> have markedly different fitness costs is less clear, as the two plasmids are a similar size and share the same replication and conjugation functions. the marked fitness difference is therefore most likely due to accessory genes. the antibiotic resistance gene complement of the two plasmids is similar, although not identical . the main differences are the presence of the arscbadr on r <dig> and a type  <dig> restriction system and a number of putative metabolic genes on n <dig>  it is likely that one or more additional genes on n <dig> are responsible for the high fitness cost of n <dig> but this hypothesis requires experimental confirmation. alternatively, a small mutation in the core plasmid genome may also be responsible.

the fitness impact of plasmids carrying silent antibiotic resistance genes
... in addition to variable fitness costs brought about by different host-plasmid combinations, bacteria may influence the cost of plasmid carriage by modulation of gene expression. as antibiotic resistance can impose a fitness cost on the bacterial host in the absence of antibiotic selection, one might expect phenotypic silencing of plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance genes to confer a fitness advantage. the fitness costs of the plasmids pve <dig> and rp <dig> on e. coli 345-2rifc had previously been established as moderate in vitro and non-detectable in vivo. neither plasmid had a detectable cost in the pig gut  <cit> . however, in both cases isolates that no longer expressed the resistance genes encoded on them but retained intact and wild-type resistance genes, were recovered during the pig gut colonisation experiments  <cit> . here, we investigated whether silencing of antibiotic resistance genes carried on pve <dig> and rp <dig> had an effect on their fitness impact.

three isolates with silent pve46-encoded antibiotic resistance genes were investigated in vitro; l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> . each isolate demonstrated variable degrees of antibiotic resistance gene silencing  <cit> . pair-wise growth competition assays were performed between silent isolates and the wild-type isolates expressing all antibiotic resistance genes. isolate l <dig> had a slight in vitro cost of - <dig> % Â±  <dig> % per generation whilst isolates l <dig> and l <dig> had slight fitness advantages of + <dig>  Â±  <dig> % and + <dig> % Â±  <dig> % per generation, respectively. however, the statistical significance of these results was low and overall the impact of silencing of pve <dig> genes on fitness appeared negligible. the in vivo ability of isolate l <dig> to colonize the pig gut was found to be comparable to that of 345-2rifc .

3345-2rifc strain with rp <dig> encoding silent antimicrobial resistance genes

in contrast, antibiotic resistance gene silencing had a significant effect on the fitness of e. coli 345-2rifc. the silent isolates p <dig> and p <dig>  both had fitness advantages of + <dig>  Â±  <dig> % and + <dig>  Â±  <dig> % in vitro, respectively. p <dig> was also able to colonize the pig gut better than 345-2rifc .

surprisingly, antibiotic resistance gene silencing did not confer a fitness advantage on isolates carrying the pve <dig> plasmid, in vivo or in vitro. this suggests that in this case antibiotic resistance gene silencing may have occurred by random chance that was fortuitously detected, or that if it exists, any fitness advantage only manifests itself under conditions not measured by our current assays. this observation may be explained by the fact that the initial cost conferred by carriage of pve <dig> on e. coli 345-2rifc was moderate,  <dig>  Â±  <dig> %, per generation. however, previous studies did show that pve46-encoded antibiotic resistance genes were able to revert back to resistance at rates varying between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> in vitro  <cit>  suggesting that such strains may still pose a clinical threat.

in contrast, silencing of antibiotic resistance genes encoded on the plasmid rp <dig> conferred a significant fitness benefit both in vivo and in vitro. such a strategy could be deemed beneficial for the bacterium, particularly if they were able to revert to antibiotic resistance again when challenged with antibiotic. however, this was not the case as none of the isolates with silent rp <dig> antibiotic resistance genes  were able to revert back to resistance in the laboratory. this suggests that the genetic event responsible for antibiotic resistance gene silencing of rp <dig> is not readily reversible, for example a transposon insertion or dna deletion. under such conditions one would expect the silenced dna to eventually be lost, but until then it may act as an environmental reservoir of resistance genes.

in theory any fitness effects observed in silent isolates could also be attributed to unrelated mutations that may have arisen in the pig gut prior to their isolation. however, the silent isolate l <dig> is not known to carry any mutations compared to the wild-type 345-2rifc strain, whilst the possible role of unrelated mutations in the remaining isolates is yet to be determined .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the results presented here show that the fitness balance between the host genotype and a given resistance plasmid is extremely delicate and that even minor differences in the host or in the plasmid can have substantial effects on fitness. future studies on the subject should therefore investigate multiple hosts in order to draw any general conclusions about a particular plasmid. without better molecular understanding of the processes involved, it is difficult to predict the fitness impact of a given host-plasmid association, and hence difficult to make predictions about the spread or decline of associated antibiotic resistance phenotypes. it is therefore important to study molecular host-plasmid interactions. in the absence of such data one should preferably use a range of host strains and plasmids when studying the fitness of a particular resistance phenotype. as plasmids belonging to the incn and incp <dig> groups are broad-host range and conjugative they will likely move from host to host until they encounter one where costs are negligible and subsequently go on to thrive with that host. thus, such plasmids may be of particular concern in the dissemination of novel antibiotic resistance phenotypes.

in addition, bacteria can sometimes "hide" their resistance genotype by silencing it. this can create a fitness advantage for the bacteria, whereas in other cases the silent phenotype is reversible, indicating that there is a risk of treatment failure in anyone infected by bacteria with silent genes and being treated by one of the affected antibiotics.

based on these observations, further work should now concentrate on understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible so that the underlying process are understood and used to help develop better treatment and prevention and control strategies.
