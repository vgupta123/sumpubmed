BACKGROUND
epec is an important cause of infant diarrhea in the developing world and is one of several gastrointestinal pathogens of humans and animals capable of causing distinctive lesions in the gut, termed attaching and effacing  lesions  <cit> . a/e lesions are manifested by damage to the integrity of the enterocyte cytoskeleton, which involves intimate attachment of the bacteria to the cell surface coincident with the formation of actin rich pedestal-like structures underneath tightly adherent bacteria  <cit> . a/e lesion formation is mediated by proteins encoded within a large pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement   <cit> , which is essential for a/e lesion formation and highly conserved among a/e pathogens  <cit> . the lee encodes regulators, a type iii secretion system , t3ss chaperones as well as secreted translocator and effector proteins  <cit> . the t3ss itself is a multiprotein needle-like complex evolutionarily related to the flagella apparatus that comprises more than  <dig> proteins spanning both the inner and outer membranes of the bacterial envelope. the t3ss secretes and translocates virulence effector proteins from the bacterial cytosol directly into the host cell cytoplasm, where the effector proteins facilitate disease development  <cit> . structurally the needle complex closely resembles a flagella basal body  <cit> , supporting an evolutionary relationship between the flagella export apparatus and t3sss. however, despite the architectural similarity between the flagella biosynthesis machinery and t3sss, the structural components of the needle complex share limited sequence similarity with components of the flagella basal body  <cit> .

a unique feature of the epec lee-encoded t3ss is the presence of a filamentous structure formed by monomers of espa that connect the escf t3ss needle to the pore forming translocation proteins, espb and espd  <cit> . espa demonstrates discrete sequence similarity to flagellin in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein which is predicted with high probability to adopt a coiled-coil conformation  <cit> . similar to the assembly of flagella from the polymerization of monomeric flagellin  <cit> , polymerization of espa to form filaments depends on coiled-coil interactions between espa subunits  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that espa subunits are added to the tip of the growing filament in a similar manner to a growing flagellum  <cit> . although espa filament diameter  is smaller than that of flagella , its assembly has a lumen diameter and helical symmetry parameters very similar to those of the flagellar filamentous structure  <cit> . despite these structural similarities, to date no functional overlap has been observed between the two protein secretion systems in epec. in this study, we observed that flic was consistently present in the secretome of wild type epec e2348/ <dig> or an Δespadb mutant of e2348/ <dig> but only weakly present in the secretome of a Δescf  mutant of epec e2348/ <dig>  we determined that flic could be secreted by the lee-encoded t3ss of epec e2348/ <dig> and that flic exported in this manner was able to stimulate an inflammatory response via the pathogen-recognition molecule for bacterial flagellin, toll-like receptor  <dig> .

RESULTS
analysis of the epec e2348/ <dig> secretome
the secretome of epec e2348/ <dig> is dominated by the presence of the translocators, espa, espb and espd  <cit> . the genes encoding these proteins are located together in the lee <dig> operon. to identify less abundant proteins in the epec e2348/ <dig> supernatant, we generated an Δespadb mutant and compared the secreted protein profile of this mutant with that of a Δescf t3ss mutant epec icc <dig> by two dimensional gel electrophoresis . escf encodes the needle structure of the lee-encoded t3ss and mutations in escf abolish secretion of the translocator and effector proteins  <cit> . an escf mutant was used in preference to escn, which encodes the t3ss atpase, as an escn mutant showed greater cell lysis in culture during growth in hdmem . however some cell breakdown was still observed for icc <dig> which may account for some spots visualized by 2-dge . both the Δespadb mutant and icc <dig> were grown in hepes buffered dmem  ph  <dig> – <dig>  to an od <dig> of  <dig>  to induce expression of the lee t3ss. cultures  were pooled to control for variations in growth and supernatant proteins were collected by trichloroacetic acid  precipitation. following 2-dge, consistent and dominant spots were excised for tryptic in-gel digestion and maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis. since the genome sequence of epec e2348/ <dig> was not yet annotated, peptide mass fingerprints were analyzed against a limited library of open reading frames from epec e2348/ <dig> http://www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/microbes. as expected, the autotransporter espc was present in the supernatant of both the Δespadb mutant and icc <dig>  although we did not identify any non-lee encoded effector proteins using this approach, we did find that flic was present abundantly in the supernatants of the Δespadb mutant  and wild-type epec  but was greatly reduced in the supernatant of the Δescf mutant, icc <dig> . this was unexpected as previous studies have reported that epec flagellation and motility is down regulated by growth in dmem  <cit> . in addition, we observed that fima export was upregulated in the Δespadb mutant. although we did not investigate the basis for increased fima protein, fima is know to be co-regulated with flagella biosynthesis in e. coli  <cit> . thus increased fima production and export may be connected to increased flic production and export. unfortunately, we were not able to identify any further protein spots by maldi-tof analysis other than fima, espc and flic.

the lee-encoded t3ss promotes flagellin export
the reduced amount of flic in the supernatant of icc <dig> grown in hdmem but not the Δespadb mutant suggested that either flagellin synthesis and/or export was connected to expression of the lee-encoded t3ss, since both mutants contain a functional flagella biosynthesis locus, or perhaps that the inactivation of espd led to increased flic expression which has been reported previously  <cit> . to examine the association between the presence of a functional lee-encoded t3ss and flagellin synthesis and export in hdmem, we used mono-specific anti-h <dig> flic antibodies and immunoblotting to examine the production and secretion of flic into the culture supernatant by various derivatives of epec. initially we confirmed that flic secretion in hdmem by icc <dig> was reduced compared with epec e2348/ <dig> and the Δespadb mutant . to determine if secretion could occur in the absence of a functional flagella biosynthesis apparatus, we inactivated flii which encodes the flagella system atpase essential for flic export by this pathway  <cit> . although the results showed that flic was not found in the supernatant of the Δflii mutant grown in hdmem , a band corresponding to flic was also not present in whole cell lysates preparations suggesting that mutation of flii also abrogated expression of flic . in addition, we observed a reduction in the production of flic by the escf mutant grown in hdmem . these data are consistent with previous reports that flic expression is down regulated if the protein is not exported  <cit> . when epec derivatives were grown in lb which promotes motility and down regulation of the lee-encoded t3ss, flic was produced and exported by all strains except the flii mutant . this indicated that mutation of escf did not affect flic expression and flic export under conditions that promote flagellation and motility but suggested that under conditions favoring expression of the lee-encoded t3ss, escf was needed for flic synthesis and/or export.

secretion of flagellin via the lee-encoded t3ss of epec e2348/69
to define further the relationship between flic secretion in hdmem and expression of the lee t3ss, we expressed flic from an iptg inducible promoter in the expression vector, ptrc99a to overcome the negative feedback inhibition of flic production in the flii and escf mutants observed earlier. this plasmid was termed pflic. a Δflic mutant was constructed to serve as a control strain and inducible expression and successful secretion of flic was demonstrated from pflic  <dig> min after induction with iptg . an analysis of culture supernatants for the presence of the cytoplasmic protein, dnak, showed that overexpression of flic from pflic did not result in increased cell lysis .

to investigate the contribution of the lee-encoded t3ss and the flagella secretion system to flic export in hdmem, we constructed a Δflii/escf double mutant where both the lee-encoded and flagella secretion systems were inactivated. pflic was introduced into the Δflic, Δflii and Δflii/escf mutant strains and immunoblotting of whole cell lysates showed that flic expression was successfully induced . we then examined the supernatants of the Δflii and Δflii/escf mutants carrying pflic for secretion of flic after induction with iptg for  <dig> min. secretion of flic was detected in supernatants derived from the Δflii mutant but was greatly reduced in the Δflii/escf mutant . to verify that a functional lee t3ss was required for flic secretion when the flagella export system was inactivated, we complemented the Δflii/escf mutant with pflicescf. immunoblot analysis of supernatant proteins showed that flagellin export was partially restored to the Δflii/escf mutant upon trans-complementation with escf . the success of trans-complementation with escf was also confirmed by performing a fluorescence actin staining  test . therefore, in the absence of a functional flagella secretion apparatus , flic export still occurred if the lee-encoded t3ss was intact. the involvement of the flagellin chaperone, flis, in flic secretion by the lee-encoded t3ss was examined by constructing a double Δflii/flis mutant. flagellin expressed from pflic was secreted by theΔflii/flis mutant in equivalent amounts to Δflii  suggesting that the flis chaperone was not involved in lee-dependent flic secretion . to determine whether flic was recognized as an effector or a translocator by the lee-encoded t3ss, we also examined flic export by a sepl mutant. the mutation of sepl leads to preferential secretion of effectors and reduced secretion of translocators  <cit> . we found that the sepl mutant secreted flagellin in equivalent amounts to the Δespadb mutant suggesting that flic was recognized as an effector of the lee-encoded t3ss .

flagellin exported by the lee t3ss induces nf-kappa b activity but does not confer motility
previous work has shown that flic from epec e2348/ <dig> can stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production through tlr <dig> signaling  <cit> . indeed, epec h <dig> flagellin is a potent activator of interleukin- <dig> release in t <dig> and ht- <dig> intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . here we investigated host cell signaling in response to epec e2348/ <dig> flagellin by measuring nf-kappa b activation in human embryonic kidney hek <dig> cells using an nf-kappa b dependent luciferase reporter assay. since hek <dig> cells possess functional tlr <dig> and non-functional forms of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  the cell line is most likely responsive only to flagellin and not to gram-negative lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . as expected, there was a correlation between the presence of flic in the bacterial culture supernatant and nf-kappa b activation . although the activation of nf-kappa b by wild type epec e2348/ <dig> supernatant proteins  appeared lower than strains producing the same amount of flic , the western blot presented represented one experiment only and nf-kappa b activation was performed more than three times using different preparations of supernatant proteins. despite batch to batch variation in supernatant protein preparations, the results of mean nf-kappa b activity showed that flic present in the culture supernatant of the Δflii mutant carrying pflic could stimulate a  <dig> fold greater increase in nf-kappa b activity compared to the Δflii/escf mutant carrying pflic . as expected, the flii mutant derivatives of epec e2348/ <dig> secreting flic via the lee-encoded t3ss were non-motile , due to the absence of an intact flagella export apparatus.

discussion
many gram-negative pathogens utilize a t3ss to deliver diverse effector proteins directly into eukaryotic cells. the structure of the t3ss apparatus is conserved among different pathogens and shares structural similarity with the flagella basal body. the reported ancestral relationship between the two secretion systems is based on low sequence similarity between some components as well as functional conservation  <cit> . under certain conditions, virulence effector proteins may be secreted, but not translocated by the flagella t3ss  <cit> . the preferential secretion of effector proteins by their cognate t3ss rather than the flagella export apparatus depends largely on a system of chaperones that confer pathway specificity. in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, truncated forms of the effectors sptp and sope that lack the chaperone binding domain for secretion by the t3ss are instead secreted by the flagella export apparatus  <cit> . this suggests that not only do the t3ss system chaperones confer pathway specificity, but also that the flagella export system is the default secretion pathway for unchaperoned proteins  <cit> .

recently, miao et al  showed that flagellin from s. typhimurium present in the cytosol of infected macrophages stimulated il1-β release in macrophages through activation of the intracellular nacht-leucine-rich repeat protein, ipaf. the activation of ipaf by cytosolic flagellin was dependent on the spi1-encoded t3ss and not the flagella biosynthesis locus  <cit> . the authors suggested that flagellin secretion most likely occurred via the spi <dig> t3ss needle complex and concluded that the accidental export of flagellin into the host cell by the spi <dig> t3ss may provide an advantage to the host through the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and release  <cit> . in this study, we also detected the secretion of flagellin by epec in the absence of a functional flagella export apparatus that was largely dependent on the lee-encoded t3ss and this indiscriminate secretion of flagellin had the potential to stimulate nf-kappa b activity. however, we were not able to visualize flic in the intracellular environment of the host cell using immunofluorescence to compare flic staining in permeabilized and non-permeabilized hela cells infected with epec . this suggested that in contrast to the spi1-encoded t3ss of salmonella, the lee-encoded t3ss of epec did not translocate flagellin into the host cell. it remains possible however, that the method used here to visualize intracellular flagellin was not sensitive enough to detect small amounts of translocated flic protein.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the flagella and lee-encoded t3sss of epec have undergone selection to evolve temporal differences in expression and specificity of function through a system of chaperones and regulatory checks that maintain mutually exclusive export of the t3ss effectors and flagellin. the fact that epec infection does not result in a strong inflammatory response suggests that there has been strong evolutionary selection against tlr <dig> activation during a/e lesion formation  <cit> . indeed, despite the structural similarity between espa and flic, espa lacks the major d <dig> domain that activates tlr <dig> signaling by flic  <cit> . the dedicated function of the respective virulence-associated and flagella t3sss to the secretion of their cognate substrates is likely to be critical in ensuring that flagellin is not accidentally released during the important initial stages of infection where it may prematurely activate inflammatory signaling pathways.
