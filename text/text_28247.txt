BACKGROUND
upon retrovirus infection of somatic cells, the integrated provirus will not be passed on to the host progeny as a part of the genome. however, following infection of the germ line, the integrated provirus will be transmitted to the offspring. consequently, progeny developed from infected germ cells will carry the provirus as part of their genome, and it will be transmitted vertically through generations as an endogenous retrovirus . each independent germ line infection event defines a novel erv family, which may increase its copy number due to intracellular retrotransposition  <cit>  or extracellularly via re-infection  <cit> , and in the end each erv infection results in a few to several hundred genomic copies  <cit> . most hervs invaded our genome at least  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , after separation of old world and new world monkeys around  <dig> mya  <cit> . ervs that entered the human genome before the split of human  and chimpanzee  are characterized as ancient hervs. however, some hervs, characterized as modern hervs, are human-specific and have entered the human genome after the homo sapiens/pan troglodytes split. further, some herv loci have been reported to show insertional polymorphism in the human genome, even one herv locus has entered the human genome less than  <dig> mya  <cit> .

generally herv-encoded genes are thought to be inactivated by negative selection, followed by degeneration due to mutational decay during evolution. however, a few herv loci do still maintain intact open reading frames of viral genes, indicating either recent integration or ongoing purifying selection. no replication-competent hervs have yet been described, although fully intact members of the herv-k group have been reported  <cit> . nevertheless, trans-complementation and recombination of human herv-k loci can generate functional herv-k elements, indicating that human cells still have the potential to produce infectious retrovirus particles  <cit> . however, other mammalian species such as mouse, cat and pig harbor many modern ervs which are still replication-competent  <cit> .

intact envelope genes have been shown to be transcribed in several healthy tissues  <cit> , and the conservation in an otherwise degenerated herv locus has led to speculations about a likely beneficial role for the host. these include  protecting the fetus due to immunomodulatory properties via an immunosuppressive domain located in the tm subunit of the envelope  <cit> ,  preventing present-day retroviral infections by inhibiting cell entry of related exogenous retroviruses that use a common surface receptor, a process called receptor interference in which the receptor-binding-domain of su blocks the receptor  <cit> , or  being used as triggers to provide cell-cell fusion in which the fusion machinery of tm is activated by binding of su to a cellular receptor. in particular three herv envelope genes can induce cell-cell fusion in vitro, syncytin  <dig>  <cit> , syncytin  <dig>  <cit> , and envpb <dig>  <cit> . all three are candidates for having a beneficial function because they are evolutionarily conserved and have undergone purifying selection during primate evolution  <cit> . furthermore all single nucleotide polymorphisms  within the three envelope genes are either synonymous or they do not influence fusiogenicity  <cit> .

syncytin  <dig> and syncytin  <dig> show placenta-specific expression  <cit> , which may be an implication of a physiological role of herv envelope proteins in mediating cell-cell fusion in placenta forming the syncytiotrophoblast. in fact inhibition of syncytin  <dig> in human cytotrophoblasts leads to a decrease in cell fusion  <cit> , indicating a plausible physiological role of syncytin  <dig> in placenta development. syncytin  <dig> might protect the fetus against the mother's immune system due to immunosuppressive properties  <cit> , but so far none of them have been well enough characterized to draw functional conclusions.

during a screen of the human genome for retroviral open reading frames  <cit> , we identified a new group, dubbed herv-v  <cit> , containing two almost identical envelope genes. herv-v was recently proposed to be a degenerate syncytin  <cit> . however, we here demonstrate that selection has preserved at least one of the envelope genes through simian evolution, and that the other envelope gene has been partly preserved by gene conversion.

RESULTS
the two, almost identical, herv-v envelope genes are both located on chromosome 19q <dig>  with a distance between the two loci of ~ <dig> kb   <cit> . in order to distinguish the two envelopes from each other, we propose naming one locus herv-v <dig> and its envelope envv <dig>  and the other locus herv-v <dig> and its envelope envv <dig> . envv <dig> has a  <dig> amino-acid long open reading frame and envv <dig> has an open reading frame containing  <dig> amino acids. variation is only observed in the c-terminus of the genes by a ~ <dig> amino-acid truncation of envv <dig>  due to a one nucleotide insertion leading to a frame shift. a tblastn search shows no other closely related sequences in the human genome and a sensitive blastn search using the cross-species ltr consensus show no sign of solitary ltrs. further, both envelopes show high similarity in the c-terminal part to two other herv envelope genes: ervwe <dig>  and herv-frd    <cit> . phylogenetic comparison indicates that herv-v is a small new family of ervs, most closely related to that of mer <dig>  mer <dig> and z <dig> families  <cit> .

the envv envelope genes are conserved in simians
using tblastn and blat we found envv <dig> and envv <dig> at homologous positions on chromosome  <dig> in chimpanzee , sumatran orangutan , rhesus macaque  and marmoset  . in all species, the envv <dig> gene is intact, whereas the envv <dig> gene is preserved only in chimpanzee and rhesus macaque, where it exhibits a full-length orf with no c-terminal truncation or stop codons. in orangutan, rhesus macaque and marmoset, envv <dig> and envv <dig> are separated by 45– <dig> kb and exhibit a third erv-v locus in between, named erv-v <dig>  no envv homologues were detected in any genome more distant than those of new world monkeys.

additionally, we screened a primate dna panel with pcr primers flanking either the envv <dig> or envv <dig> envelope genes  and were able to amplify the expected  <dig> -kb amplicon from hominoidea, old world monkeys and new world monkeys , african green monkey and squirrel monkey , respectively). in addition, the envv <dig> was also detected in the african green monkey by an internal ~ <dig> bp pcr fragment . interestingly, sequencing of the pcr products revealed that the envv <dig> gene is preserved in all species analyzed and envv <dig> is preserved in old world monkeys , whereas orangutan and squirrel monkey only show preservation of envv <dig> .

we also attempted to pcr amplify the  <dig>  kb fragment from the prosimian ring-tailed lemur . however, no amplicon emerged , in agreement with a database search on the accessible prosimian genome-sequencing-trace reads. in summary, both database searches and pcr amplification of envv <dig>  envv <dig> and envv <dig> indicated an integration of erv-v after the simian-prosimian  split  and before the catarrhini-platyrrhini split , immediately followed by a new infection/reinfection and a duplication of the genome surrounding the erv-v locus, or vice versa. similarity between the 5' and 3' genomic regions surrounding the erv-v <dig> and erv-v <dig> loci suggests that a genomic duplication has assisted in generating erv-v <dig> and erv-v <dig>  e.g. a  <dig> bp fragment upstream of herv-v <dig>  has 77% similarity to a region upstream of herv-v <dig>  the same is also found in chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. this similarity cannot be found in the regions flanking the erv-v <dig> locus. however, the erv-v <dig> locus is absent in hominidae, indicating a deletion of the erv-v <dig> before the human and chimpanzee separation .

in theory, ltr sequence divergence can be used as a rough indicator of integration time, since the two ltrs are identical at the time of integration, but the estimate might be problematic because of confounding processes such as recombination and conversion  <cit> . the ltr divergences  indicate that the erv-v locus descended from an old integration by being even more distinct than herv-frd  ltrs   <cit> , which integrated on the same branch of the primate phylogeny. however our ltr-analysis indicates unrealistic divergence times for both erv-v <dig>  and syncytin  <dig>  showing the difficulties in using ltr divergence for dating old, conserved erv integrations.

gene conversion between erv-v envelope genes
on the basis of the finding that both erv-v copies can be dated back to before the catarrhini-platyrrhini split, we expect the evolutionary distance between the paralogue envv genes  to be larger than the evolutionary distance between orthologue envv genes  within the most distant species , resulting in two monophyletic groups, each following the primate phylogeny . to our surprise, we observed that the paralogue genes were more closely related than the orthologue genes between the most distant species, hominidae/cercopithecidae and platyrrhini .

a clear change in the substitution pattern was observed in the envv1/envv <dig> alignment, and a subsequent gene-conversion test  <cit>  yielded highly significant results . the result indicates that gene conversion has taken place in all lineages, with 5' gene conversion breaks situated before the coding sequence or between position 1– <dig> as numbered from the initiator atg, and 3' gene-conversion breaks between positions 1153– <dig>  to get an indication of the 5' gene conversion break, we extracted the variable sites from human, chimpanzee and macaque 5'utrs. a shift in mutation pattern was observed around position - <dig>  upstream of which the erv-vs follow the expected mutation pattern, whereas the pattern downstream of this position is consistent with gene conversion .

p-values are bonferroni-adjusted karlin-altschul p-vaules. the positions are corresponding to the aligned positions in the envv <dig> and envv <dig> sequences. "# poly" is the number of polymorphic sites in the fragment. "# dif" is the number of mismatches in the fragment. "total dif" is the number of mismatch between envv <dig> and envv <dig> in the species.

when only looking at variable sites  we note that the alignment is divided into two parts. the first part  contains mutations that are shared by both paralogue and orthologue envv's within the hominidae and old world monkey lineage respectively, a pattern consistent with gene conversion. the resulting phylogenetic tree  shows envv sequences clustering into monophyletic groups, where envv <dig> and envv <dig> cluster together inside each group. this is consistent with this region of the envv <dig> locus being transferred to the envv <dig> locus  by gene conversion. the other part  is consistent with a model of normal species-like evolution, which is supported by the corresponding phylogenetic tree  showing paralogue envv genes splitting into two groups.

evidence of purifying selection of the envv <dig> gene
the envv <dig> envelope orfs have been conserved since integration more than  <dig> mya . in some species both erv loci contain an intact env gene  whereas in other species the envv <dig> gene is degenerated.

all sequences show very high conservation within the envv <dig> region, whereas the similarity drops in flanking regions . additionally, the hydrophobicity profile and several characteristic motifs within gammaretroviruses are preserved in all full-length envv2s during evolution . these include a cwic motif involved in su subunit and tm subunit interaction  <cit>  and in controlling the fusion by a disulfide isomerization step  <cit> , the cleavage site  between su and tm of the envelope gene, the hydrophobic domain in the n-terminus of tm corresponding to the fusion peptide, two heptad repeats in tm, involved in a conformational change in the envelope during fusion  <cit> , the cks-17-like immunosuppressive domain that has immunosuppressive activity  <cit> , and the transmembrane region anchoring the envelope protein to the membrane.

the herv-v <dig> locus contains eight sine elements all located closely outside envv <dig>  both inside and between gag and pol fragments . assuming a random distribution of sine elements within the herv-v <dig> locus , the probability of observing the  <dig> sine elements outside and  <dig> sine elements inside the envv <dig> gene is significant , indicating that the envv <dig> gene has survived transposon crossfire.

the entire envelope gene shows purifying selection between all pairs of species, but not between the two almost identical orangutan sequences when testing the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions . a site-specific selection analysis using paml  <cit>  provides strong support for a model with two site classes , one under strong purifying selection  and one neutral class . although some positions show signs of positive selection , there is no significant support for a positive selection model .

additionally, envv <dig> and envv <dig> have been shown to have a placenta-specific expression in humans  <cit>  and our rt-pcr data confirmed this particular expression . interestingly, est-data from both olive baboon  and human verify the placental expression of envv <dig> and envv <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
the herv-v <dig> and herv-v <dig> loci display a remarkable evolution. they are the only two copies of the herv-v family within the human genome, and there is no evidence of any solitary ltrs. however, the identified ltr regions are small and fragmented and there has been a long time span since integration. this prevents efficient recognition of solitary ltrs using blast, hence it is possible that they are present but remain undetected. in both herv-v family members, the envelope genes  consist of a long orf. erv-v <dig> and erv-v <dig> are located in tandem in all species analyzed as a result of a gene duplication event. in all lineages except hominidae, a third copy, erv-v <dig>  was detected between erv-v <dig> and erv-v <dig>  the tandem location of this third copy is indicative of a gene triplication at the locus, however, this could not be directly proven, since no flanking sequence homologies were found.

the human envv <dig> shows a minor truncation at the c-terminus, due to a  <dig> nucleotide insert, leading to a frame shift, which has not been shown to be polymorphic in the human population, according to snp databases . however, the truncation has little impact on the structural prediction of the envv <dig> protein, nevertheless, the cytoplasmic tail is missing. both envv <dig> and envv <dig> contain all structural motifs within envelope proteins reported to be important in viral-cell fusion. this suggests a similar function of the envv genes in the host by mediating cell-cell fusion, as has been observed for three other herv envelopes . phylogenetic studies show that the erv-v family was fixed in an ancestral genome before the catarrhini-platyrrhini split ~ <dig> mya but after simians had evolutionarily separated from the prosimians . sequence analyses confirmed that envv <dig> is preserved among simians, and envv <dig> has been preserved in most species within catarrhini, further all species except hominidae enclose an extra erv-v copy , which seems to be lost in the hominidae lineage . a detailed comparative analysis of the erv-v <dig> locus shows that the envv <dig> genes have been subjected to purifying selection . additionally, envv <dig> survival during transposon crossfire inside the erv-v <dig> locus supports purifying selection of the envv <dig> gene. it is unlikely that the envelope gene has been maintained as a result of retroviral replication through an extracellular cycle, since the sites of integration have been maintained through simian evolution. in conclusion, the results provide a strong argument of their beneficial role of the envv <dig> gene for the host.

envv <dig> and envv <dig> expression in placenta is particularly interesting since the two herv envelope proteins  having been shown to cause cell-cell fusion in vitro are also highly expressed in placenta  <cit> . syncytin  <dig> appears to display an important role in placenta development  <cit>  and syncytin  <dig> may have immunosuppressive properties in placenta  <cit> . furthermore, est data show placenta expression of envv <dig> and envv <dig> in olive baboon , which demonstrates that the placental expression is indeed conserved through simian evolution. the placenta-specific expression in combination with the purifying selection documented by our phylogenetic analysis indicates that envv <dig>  is likely to play a physiological role in the placenta.

comparative analysis of the two erv-v loci suggests that gene conversion within the envv loci has taken place by dna transfer of the major part of 5' region of envv <dig> to envv <dig> . gene conversion seems to be a common event in this region, since it has taken place in all lineages . gene conversion is a common event in evolution, and is favored between paralogue genes located on the same chromosome less than  <dig> kb apart  <cit>  just as envv <dig> and envv <dig>  gene conversion has also been reported within other erv families  <cit> , however, none of them within coding viral genes. the gene conversion break points are located just upstream of the putative translation initiation site and downstream of the immunosuppressive domain  resulting in a ~ <dig>  kb gene conversion tract. recent results have shown that the isu of envv <dig> contains immunosuppressive activity  <cit> , and we have shown that the isu of envv <dig> and envv <dig> are preserved, indicating a conservation of immunosuppressive activity through evolution. additionally, the study has shown that an envelope gene truncated after the isu maintains the immunosuppressive activity  <cit> . in this manner, gene conversion in the hominidae and cercopithecidea lineage homogenizes the envv genes and induces two envv genes, both having a structure compatible with preservation of immunosuppressive properties.

in most simians, envv <dig> and envv <dig> have been preserved, raising the possibility of a distinct biological function of their protein products which differ in their c-terminal parts. such function is consistent with the finding that both loci are expressed in humans as well as in olive baboon. however, this hypothesis of a separate function of the two envv genes is not supported by phylogenetic analysis in simians as such, since orangutan and new world monkeys hold only one intact envv gene.

neither envv <dig> or envv <dig> have been shown to be fusiogenic  <cit> , but a fusiogenic property of envv in placenta development cannot be excluded, since the selection pressure on the envv <dig> gene is not only restricted to the region necessary in having immunosuppressive activity, but includes the entire envelope gene. however, the fusiogenic properties may be activated by a physiological environment in placenta, like high-oxygen pressure has been found to regulate the pathway of cytotrophoblast differentiation  <cit> . receptor recognition of the envv proteins may also be different to that of other envelope proteins such as syncytin  <dig>  since the organization of the cwic domain   within the su is different. in envv the cwic motif is located in the n-terminal part of the su while it is located more c-terminally in syncytin  <dig> and envelope proteins of other gammaretroviruses. however this su organization is not conflicting with envelope fusiogenic activity, since this organization is also observed in the fusiogenic syncytin  <dig>  <cit> , syncytin a and syncytin b  <cit>  erv envelopes.

another potential function of the envv genes could be the prevention of present-day infections by exogenous retroviruses through blocking the receptor used by the attacking virus, a process called receptor interference, as seen for other erv envelope genes  <cit> . this possibility is consistent with the high sequence similarity and purifying selection of envv <dig> among species, but the host-receptor and the receptor binding domain of the envelope protein are unknown. notably, the gene conversion events have preserved two copies of the presumed envv receptor binding domain, located in the n-terminal part of su in all known retroviruses. moreover, in all species encoding an envv <dig> protein this is predicted to be membrane-anchored and may thus potentially have receptor-interference activity. this is also the case for humans where the c-terminal truncation envv <dig> does not abrogate membrane anchoring.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses have shown that the erv-v family is small, consisting of two copies in hominidae. however, orangutan, old world monkeys and new world monkeys include an extra copy, all located in tandem on chromosome  <dig>  the erv-v <dig> envelope envv <dig> has been preserved for more than  <dig> million years in all species tested. within hominidae and old world monkeys the envv <dig> has been preserved by gene conversion of a  <dig>  kb region encoding the n-terminal part of envv <dig>  meaning that they contain two copies of the envv envelope, both expressed in placenta. these data provide strong evidence of a beneficial role for the host in placenta. a likely function of the envv gene could be: i) protecting the fetus against the immune system of the mother, due to immunosuppressive properties  <cit> . ii) mediating cell fusion and making of the syncytiotrophoblast. iii) blocking a retroviral receptor through receptor-interference and thereby preventing present-day retroviral infections.
