BACKGROUND
since various 'omics' datasets are becoming available, biology has transited from a data-poor to a data-rich environment. this has underscored the need for systems analysis in biology and systems biology has become a rapidly growing field as well  <cit> .

a change in mathematical modelling philosophy is also necessitated, and that is based on building and validating in silico models. modern biological models need to meet new sets of criteria: organism-specific, data-driven, easily scalable, and so on. many modelling approaches, such as kinetic, stochastic and cybernetic approaches, are currently being used to model cellular processes. owing to the computational complexity and the large number of parameters needed, it is currently difficult to use these methods to model genome-scale networks. to date, genome-scale models of metabolism have only been analyzed with the constraint-based modelling philosophy  <cit> . genome-scale network models of diverse cellular processes such as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and metabolism have been generated. gene-protein-reaction  associated models can keep track of associations between genes, proteins, and reactions  <cit> , and there have been several genome-scale gpr models, such as e. coli  <cit> , s. aureus  <cit> , h. pylori  <cit> , m. barkeri  <cit> , s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and b. subtilis  <cit> . a reconstruction is herein defined as the list of biochemical reactions occurring in a particular cellular system and the associations between these reactions and relevant proteins, transcripts and genes  <cit> . a reconstruction can include the assumptions necessary for computational simulation, such as maximum reaction rates and nutrient uptake rates  <cit> .

computer simulations of complex biological systems become essential as soon as the computational capability become available. as reconstructed networks have been made publicly available, researchers around the world have undertaken new computational studies using these networks  <cit> . many researches apply a core set of basic in silico methods and often also describe novel methods to investigate different models. an extensive set of methods for analyzing these genome-scale models have been developed and have been applied to study a growing number of biological problems  <cit> . but as we have mentioned above, as yet, genome-scale models of metabolism have only been analyzed with the constraint-based philosophy  <cit> .

the in silico models can be applied to generate novel, testable and often quantitative predictions of cellular behaviors  <cit> . the impact of a gene deletion experiment on cellular behavior can be simulated in a manner similar to linear optimization of growth  <cit> . the results can be used to guide the design of informative confirmation experiments and will be helpful for metabolic engineering. some gene deletion studies on the genome-scale in silico models of organisms have been made  <cit> , but most of them are from the standpoints of distinguishing lethal and non-lethal genes or growth rate  <cit> . the impact of gene deletion on flux redistribution, the characters and functions of key genes, and the performance of different reactions in entire gene deletion still lack research.

in this paper, in the part of results, we have done three research works. the first one: first, we calculated flux distribution of e. coli_iaf <dig>  then we calculated the deletion impact of whole  <dig> genes , one by one, on the metabolic flux redistribution of e. coli_iaf <dig>  next, we sought out the important genes that most greatly affect the metabolic flux distribution, and furthermore determined their functional subsystems. the second one: we analyzed the correlation between p  and f , the correlation between p and d  and the correlation between p and vgene . the third one: we made research into what are the reactions affected most greatly in the whole  <dig> gene deletion . in the part of methods and materials, we introduced the gpr model, some properties of the in silico model of e. coli_iaf <dig>  format) and the method of constraint-based analysis.

RESULTS
metabolic flux distribution of e. coli_ iaf 1260
as a base for the later comparing research, we here calculate the flux distribution of e. coli_iaf <dig>  what we use is e. coli_iaf1260_ flux <dig> xml, one of the two sbml files that are presented with the reconstruction of e. coli  <cit> . the computational method we use is flux balance analysis   <cit> , one of the fundamental genome-scale phenotypic calculations, which can simulate cellular growth. fba is based on linear optimization of an objective function, which typically is biomass formation. given an uptake rate for key nutrients and the biomass composition of the cell , the maximum possible growth rate of the cells can be predicted in silico. we use the cobra toolbox  <cit>  to carry out this computation of fba. the flux distribution of e. coli_iaf <dig> is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

impact of gene deletion on the metabolic flux redistribution and key genes
as our first work, we now do research into the impact of gene deletion on the metabolic system of e. coli. first we calculate the deletion impact of  <dig> genes, further seek out important genes and functional subsystems to which these key genes respectively belong.

1) impact of gene deletion on the metabolic flux redistribution and key genes that affect metabolism most greatly
there are  <dig> genes in the model of e. coli_iaf <dig>  if a single gene is associated with multiple reactions, the deletion of that gene will result in the removal of all associated reactions. on the other hand, a reaction that can be catalyzed by multiple non-interacting gene products will not be removed in a single gene deletion. by the aid of the cobra toolbox  <cit> , we can calculate the impact of their deletion. we define the impact of one gene deletion on the whole metabolic flux redistribution as p

  p=∑ir <dig> 

where vi and v′i are respectively the flux value of i-th reaction of the model of e. coli_iaf <dig> before and after a single gene deleting and r is the whole reaction set. in most of the researches on gene deletion  <cit> , the change of growth rate f is often used to describe the impact of gene deletion. the reason why we define p as the impact of gene deletion is that we believe it is more detailed in describing the change of organism's metabolism. p has considered the flux change taking place at every reaction, and it uses the square sum of the difference between vi and v′i. otherwise, f is just a whole measure and it does not distinguish the flux change taking place at every reaction.

we define those genes with p> <dig> as key genes or high-p genes, and there are  <dig> genes in total. there are  <dig> cases in which f =  <dig>  their corresponding genes are usually called essential genes or zero-f genes, and all of their p are > <dig>  these  <dig> so-called essential genes are consistent with previous literatures  <cit> , except "s0001" which is not included in the report of ref.  <cit> . the left  <dig> genes with p >  <dig> &f ≠  <dig> are shown in table  <dig> with bold text, and we call them ine  genes. additional file  <dig> provides the details. comparing with experiment observation  <cit> , six  of the  <dig> ine genes are essential genes; comparing with experiment observation  <cit> , two  of the  <dig> ine genes are essential genes. at the same time, two genes  are reported as essential genes in ref.  <cit> , but they are not key genes as for our computation, while b <dig> is reported as nonessential gene both in ref.  <cit>  and b <dig> is reported as nonessential gene both in ref.  <cit> . from these comparisons, we can find that p has an advantage over f in describing the change of organism's metabolism.

* genes  are important but not essential genes

we also note that there are  <dig> genes with p> <dig> &f ≠  <dig>  based on the fact, we can speculate that, under some circumstances and when an important gene is deleted, a big change in the metabolic system of e. coli has taken place and e. coli may use other reaction ways to strive to live. this may reflect the robustness of the metabolic networks of microbes. it is also an important and interesting conclusion.

2) functional subsystems to which these key genes belong
if a gene catalyzes a reaction which belongs to a certain subsystem, we say that the gene belongs to the subsystem. functional subsystems about important genes in the metabolic system of micro-organism are seldom reported. we have hereinabove defined those genes with p> <dig> as key genes. we now list the functional subsystems to which every key gene belongs,  <dig> subsystems in total, and several genes appear in more than one subsystem, shown in table  <dig>  the  <dig> functional subsystems are "threonine and lysine metabolism , cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis , valine leucine and isoleucine metabolism , cell envelope biosynthesis , lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis recycling , methionine metabolism , arginine and proline metabolism , glycerophospholipid metabolism , membrane lipid metabolism , purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis , nucleotide salvage pathway , citric acid cycle , glycine and serine metabolism , tyrosine tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism , transport inner membrane , alanine and aspartate metabolism , folate metabolism , alternate carbon metabolism , histidine metabolism , cysteine metabolism , inorganic ion transport and metabolism , oxidative phosphorylation , unassigned ".

we can find that the distribution to subsystems of these  <dig> key genes is not even and most of them are related to "cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis", "cell envelope biosynthesis" and "purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis" subsystems, especially cpgb. we can also find that all of the important but not essential  genes,  <dig> in total, appear in "oxidative phosphorylation".

the reason for many high-p genes just belonging to several metabolic subsystems maybe is in that these subsystems involve many reactions and provide supports for other subsystems; the reason for ine genes just belonging to "oxidative phosphorylation " subsystem probably is in that the permissibility which e. coli use other reaction ways to carry out this kind of metabolism, under the given media condition, takes place on op subsystem.

analysis to the three characters of p
as our second work, we now begin research into some properties of the metabolic network of e. coli, i.e., three characters of p. some properties about the metabolic network of micro-organisms have been reported in literatures  <cit> . because the measure we defined is different, our research will provide further evidences to the properties about the metabolic network.

1) correlation between p and f 
2) correlation between p and d 
we compute out the related reaction number d of every gene in those  <dig> genes of the e. coli_iaf <dig> model, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  from the figure, we can find that some but not many genes have high d value, but we don't know whether they affect metabolic flux distribution greatly.

3) correlation between p and vgene 
we define the flux sum controlled by every gene as

  vgene=∑jrgene|vj| 

where vj is the flux value of j-th reaction of the model of e. coli_iaf <dig> before a single gene deleting and rgene is the reaction set controlled by the given gene. we can easily compute out the flux sum vgene of every gene in those  <dig> genes of the e. coli_iaf <dig> model, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  from the figure, we can find that some but not many genes have high vgene value, but will they affect metabolic flux distribution greatly?

impact of gene deletion on every metabolic reaction
as our third work, we now make research into what are the reactions affected most greatly in the whole  <dig> gene deletion. highly-affected reactions  are often neglected in many researches in literatures about gene deletion study.

1) impact of gene deletion on every metabolic reaction
there are  <dig> reactions in the in silico model of e. coli_iaf <dig>  we define rg to measure the impact that a reaction is gotten in the whole  <dig> gene deletion.

  rg=∑kg|vk−v0| 

where v <dig> and vk are respectively the flux value of a certain reaction of the model of e. coli_iaf <dig> before and after k-th gene deleting, and g is the set of whole  <dig> genes.

2) highly-affected reactions 
there are  <dig> reactions which the rg value of every one of them is beyond  <dig>  especially, for those with more than  <dig> rg value, there are  <dig> reactions in total, and they are "atps4rpp, co2tex, co2tpp, cytbo3_4pp, eno, ex_co <dig>  ex_h2o, ex_ o <dig>  gapd, h2otex, h2otpp, nadh16pp, o2tex, o2tpp, pgk, pgm".

why are these  <dig> reactions more sensitive to gene deletion? maybe, it is due to the fact that they involve in the metabolism of basic biomasses such as h2o, atp, o <dig>  nadh.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have done three main researches into the metabolism of e. coli in gene deletion. the first was to find its important genes and the corresponding belonging subsystems, the second was to analyze the characters of p, and the third was to find its highly-affected reactions in gene deletion.

to the first work: we used p to describe the impact which gene deletion entailed. our first finding was that maybe p is more detailed than f in describing the change of organism's metabolism in gene deletion. after calculating the deletion impact of  <dig> genes, we sought out  <dig> important genes , and they are more than essential genes . so our second finding was that under some circumstances and when an important gene is deleted, the metabolic system of e. coli has greatly changed and e. coli may use other reaction ways to strive to live. the third finding was that the distribution to subsystems of these  <dig> key genes is not even and most of them are related to about three subsystems  and that all of the  <dig> important but not essential  genes appear just in "oxidative phosphorylation" subsystem. we have also tried to give some explanations.

to the second work: we have done research into p's three characters, i.e. its relationship with f, d, vgene. we found that p-f correlation was of highly linear correlation, while both of the p-d correlation and the p-vgene correlation were not of linear correlation. our research can provide further evidences to the properties about the metabolic network, because the measure we defined is different.

to the third work: we defined rg to measure the impact that a reaction is gotten in the whole  <dig> gene deletion. we calculated the rg value of each  <dig> reactions and gave a statistics to the rg scopes and the corresponding reaction number. finally, we sought out  <dig> reactions with more than  <dig> rg value. we have also tried to give an explanation, i.e., these highly-affected reactions involve in the metabolism of basic biomasses.

in summary, because the in silico model of e. coli_iaf <dig> is credible, we can conclude that the results we obtained have biological significances and that the researches we have done will shed new light on the future research. as a next step, we will try more media conditions to the research on e. coli, and will also do similar work on other organisms and compare them with the case of e. coli.
