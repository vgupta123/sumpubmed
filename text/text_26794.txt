BACKGROUND
shiga toxin encoding bacteriophages  are responsible for converting the pathogenic profiles of their bacterial hosts. enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli , a subset of the shigatoxigenic e. coli , differentiated by their ability to produce attachment and effacement lesions, emerged as a serious food borne threat to humans in the 1980s  <cit> . the emergence of this group of organisms was due to an stx phage infection of a mildly pathogenic progenitor strain  <cit> . the severe disease  and disease sequelae  caused by ehec are all linked to the activity of the shiga toxin   <cit> , the expression of which is genetically coordinated by the lytic replication cycle of stx phage  <cit> . although the global incidence of ehec infection is low, severe disease and death occurs in an unacceptably high proportion of infected individuals  <cit> : 10% and 3–5%, respectively  <cit> .

stx phages are lambdoid bacteriophages, sharing the distinct genome organisation of the archetypal bacteriophage lambda   <cit> . they possess two replication strategies: lysogenic, where the phage genome directs its integration into the bacterial host genome as a prophage; or lytic, where viral progeny are assembled intracellularly and released by lysis of the host cell through the action of phage encoded lysozyme, holin and pinholin proteins  <cit> . production of stx in the lysogen is linked to the latter, and the release of stx from the lysogen predominantly coincides with induction of the lytic cycle and bacterial host cell lysis  <cit> .

bacterial genome sequencing projects have highlighted the impact that temperate phages have upon bacterial evolution, and those that impact directly on the pathogenicity of the host bacterium are known as converting phage. in addition to stx genes carried by stx phages and expressed by e. coli, other examples of converting phage include the ctx phage encoding the cholera toxin genes expressed by vibrio cholerae <cit>  and lom and bor of bacteriophage lambda, which affect e. coli adherence to human buccal epithelial cells  <cit>  and sensitivity to serum killing  <cit> , respectively. it can be postulated that the maintenance of converting phage in a lysogen is due to positive selection pressure for prophage carriage by the host cell in an animal host.

the bacteriophage vb_ecop-24b <cit> , carrying the shiga toxin  <dig> variant   <cit>   has been well characterised  <cit>  since its initial purification following induction from a clinical isolate of e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> . φ24b infects rough and smooth strains of e. coli <cit>  and can adsorb to many members of the enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella spp  <cit> . the adsorption target for this phage is an essential outer membrane protein, bama, which is involved in the biogenesis of the gram negative bacterial outer membrane and is not only highly conserved across members of the enterobacteriaceae, but also conserved to some degree in all gram negative bacteria  <cit> . using a stx phage multi loci gene typing system  <cit> , it was demonstrated that >70% of stx phages share a gene responsible for the short-tailed phage morphotype that enables adsorption to bama  <cit> . φ24b also has the ability to multiply infect a single host cell and integrate into different sites across the e.coli chromosome  <cit> , a behaviour which departs from the lambda phage immunity dogma  <cit> . this could act to not only increase the pathogenic profile of the host with each subsequent infection  <cit> , but also enable recombination events between resident inducible and cryptic prophages, promoting the production and release of novel recombinant phage mosaics.

the objectives of this study were to sequence the genome of φ24b and apply comparative genomic analyses to highlight important genetic similarities and differences across the stx phages sequenced to date. the ultimate aim is to identify potential effectors controlling the biology of these phages and the expression of genes that provide a selective advantage to either the bacterial lysogen or to the phages themselves.

RESULTS
genome annotation
phage genes are usually small in size , and very few of them have been subjected to detailed biochemical/functional characterisation, which makes the definitive annotation of phage genomes challenging. notwithstanding the difficulties inherent in the production of informative phage genome annotation, the sequencing and subsequent annotation of the φ24b genome is reported here . its genomic organisation confirms that φ24b is a lambdoid phage sharing similar overall genetic context with bacteriophage lambda . annotation of the  <dig>  bp genome revealed  <dig> putative coding regions , comprised of  <dig> cds  that shared a high level of sequence similarity with those of known function in other lambdoid phages ; three cds , which have never been identified previously; eleven cds sharing some, but not complete, homology to those genes with poorly defined roles in lambdoid phage biology; and  <dig> cds encoding proteins of unknown function , but are found in association with other lambdoid phages . a comparison of the number of genes encoding proteins of undetermined function in stx phages and the number of hypothetical proteins encoded by sequenced e. coli isolates , demonstrates that stx phages carry a greater percentage of hypothetical genes than their e. coli hosts, 55% verses 24%, respectively , especially remarkable considering the size differential between the bacteriophage and bacterial genomes, but not an uncommon occurrence in bacteriophage genomes  <cit> . an analysis of the annotated Ф24b genome with cgview  <cit>   shows that hypothetical genes are particularly common in the late gene region of the phage; downstream of the antiterminator q,  <dig> φ24b genes were annotated  of which  <dig>  are designated as hypothetical. because of their location in the late gene region, their expression is likely to be linked to prophage induction/phage replication unless they are morons , uncoupled from the standard regulatory networks  <cit> . expression analyses of these  <dig> genes is necessary to determine if they have been carried along via in situ recombination events without impacting the bacterial host or phage replication machinery or if they have been retained in the genome under their own expression control  because they benefit the bacterial host or phage replication.

two unexpectedly large genes were identified in the Ф24b genome sequence. the first of these large genes, vb_24b  <dig>  is predicted to encode a protein of  <dig>  aa and is located close to the right end of the genome . this gene is also carried by other stx phages including 933w, vt2-sa, stx <dig> ii, stx <dig> converting bacteriophage  <dig> and min <dig>  gene vb_24b  <dig> homologues have also been identified within bacterial genomes carrying non-stx prophages, e.g. salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar kentucky isolate  encodes a gene sharing  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acid residues. the predicted protein of vb_24b  <dig> has no easily assignable function, but does possess a partial cog <dig> domain  between residues  <dig> and 1176; signalp analysis  <cit>  indicates that the first  <dig> nucleotides might function as a leader peptide. the protein encoded by vb_24b  <dig> has no homology with any protein subjected to conventional functional analysis, but tmpred  <cit>  predicts that the protein possesses membrane-spanning domains. this protein has many of the characteristics of the giant genes that typically encode surface proteins involved in bacterial fitness  <cit> , and this could be relevant to its conservation among stx phages. the second large gene, p , encodes the polymerase for Ф24b replication. pФ24b possesses a number of well characterised and conserved domains, including an intact toprim_primase domain  at the amino terminus and an intact p loop ntpase superfamily domain  at the carboxyl terminus, specifically harbouring the gp4d_helicase domain . an orthologue of pФ24b has been found in association with a shigella flexneri prophage , and in stx phage min <dig>  with an amino acid identity of 87%. pФ24b carries an intein  <cit> , interrupting amino acid residues 372– <dig>  and includes an intact hintn domain , specifically of the smart <dig> superfamily. comparison of the cds sequence excluding the intein shows that pФ24b shares significant identity with a number of prophage or bacteriophage encoded proteins including zp_ <dig>  and zp_ <dig>  associated with an unclassified member of the enterobacteriaceae , and an unidentified escherichia isolate , respectively. it is very likely that the activation of the intein will play a role in the post-translational regulation of the replication protein, but this, as well as the basic function of the intein, has yet to be experimentally determined.

φ24b also harbours the two accessory genes, lom and bor <cit> , that in bacteriophage lambda are not involved in phage replication, but do affect the fitness of lambda lysogens in mammalian hosts  <cit>  and are expected to play similar fitness roles in this stx phage and other stx phages that carry these genes.

genome comparisons
Ф24b was compared to eleven previously sequenced stx phages  <cit>   and bacteriophage lambda  <cit> . the analysis presented in figure  <dig> highlights the mosaic nature of these lambdoid phages. the most similar stx phages to Ф24b are min <dig>  <cit> , 933w  <cit> , vt2-sakai  <cit> , and the stx <dig> converting phages  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , which like Ф24b all possess a podoviridae-like morphology. these phages represent a global collection of stx phages associated with incidents of human stec infection from around the world e.g. 933w , sakai and all stx <dig> converting phages i, ii and  <dig> , stx  <dig> converting phage  <dig> , Ф24b  and min <dig> . these phages all share regions of homology with one another, but the degree of shared identity differs between phages, and no two phage are identical.

there is evidence that most circulating stx phages are short-tailed podoviridae <cit> , which have evolved an almost perfect infection strategy utilising an essential, highly conserved, outer membrane protein bama  for host cell recognition and adsorption  <cit> . this essential adsorption target, the fact that many outbreak strains carry more than one stx phage  <cit> , and the capacity of at least some stx phages to multiply infect a single host cell  <cit>  is likely to foster many opportunities to drive phage evolution through in situ recombination events. thus the similarities in genome content across the short-tailed phages depicted in figure  <dig>  excluding lambda and phi  <dig> that lie outside this group, may be a consequence of such recombination  <cit> .

genomic comparison has also shown that although many of the genes carried by stx phages encode hypothetical proteins, there are recognisable accessory genes with activities that have been characterised in other systems, e.g. exogambetlarlombor and stk. the genes exo, gam and bet are the three components of the lambda-encoded red recombinase system  <cit> . the products of these genes increase dna recombination rates, which is likely to drive the creation of novel phages and extend bacterial host ranges through in situ recombination events between resident inducible and cryptic prophages, as well as infecting phages in the bacterial lysogen  <cit> . the gene lar encodes a protein involved in the alleviation of restriction systems  <cit> , which are often used by bacteria as a primary defense against phage infection  <cit> . the genes lom and bor encode products that enhance the lysogen’s ability to colonise its host  <cit> , and stk encodes a kinase with an as yet unidentified impact on the lysogen or the lysogen’s host  <cit> , but it is clear that stk expression is controlled by the prm promoter, and its expression occurs only under conditions of stable lysogeny  <cit> .

the genes associated with the genetic switch, controlling the behaviour of these phages and their decision to enter the lysogenic or lytic replicative cycles , are present across all lambdoid phages, though distinct sequence variants are known . a pcr-based multilocus characterisation system developed for stx phages  <cit>  was applied to the  <dig> sequenced stx phages and lambda . the integrase gene of Ф24b <cit>  is also carried by the stx <dig> converting phages  <dig> and  <dig>  all three phages possess the int genes in a genomic orientation opposite to the lambda phage integrase gene. the Ф24b-like integrase gene is under the control of its own promoter region  <cit>  in all three phages from where it is likely to drive high frequency superinfection events  <cit> . the Ф24bciii gene is not present in p <dig>  but in the other phages it is well conserved sharing at least 99% aa identity. the antiterminator, n, involved in early gene expression, is present in one of three forms in all but phage p <dig>  n <dig>  <cit>  is present in Ф24b, 933w, stx <dig> converting phage i, min <dig> and bp  <dig>  all sharing at least 98% identity, and n <dig>  <cit>  is carried by vt2sa, stx <dig> phage  <dig> and yyz- <dig>  whilst lambda possesses a third variant .; the three variants can share as little as 22% sequence identity. the ci gene product, the regulator controlling maintenance of lysogeny through repression of the lytic life cycle, was identified in five variant forms. the repressor of stx phages 933w, min <dig>  stx <dig> converting i and stx <dig> converting phage  <dig> all possess ci1b, while bp- <dig> possesses ci1a, which shares 69% overall identify with the ci1a protein and 100% identity at the carboxy terminal half. sequence and structure/function predictions mean that the altered amino terminus is likely to have different dna binding properties, whilst retaining similar dimerization properties that are key to its function  <cit> . the ci2c genes from vt2-sa, stx <dig> phage ii, yyz- <dig> and stx <dig> phage  <dig> all share sequence identity across the entire coding region of the ci gene, though they are currently annotated with different amino termini. the vt2-sa ci gene amplifies with the ci2c primers, but a single nucleotide polymorphism has introduced a stop codon and thus ablates  <dig> amino acids from the amino terminus, probably destroying the ability of this repressor protein to bind dna; this may, at least partly, explain the non-inducible nature of this prophage  <cit> . the archetypal lambda repressor  shares 100% identity at its carboxy terminus with the ci2c variants, but its amino terminal end is unique, and again implies that it binds dna differently from the ci2c variants. the stx <dig> converting phage i possesses the ci <dig> variant  not previously included in the stx phage multilocus pcr typing system  <cit> . orthologues of the cro gene product  are carried by stx phages 933w, stx <dig> converting phage  <dig>  Ф24b and min <dig> and are all identical at the aa level. the cro gene variant  is carried by stx <dig> converting phages  <dig> and ii as well as vt2-sa, again sharing 100% amino acid identity. lambda phage encodes cro1; bp <dig>  cro9; yyz <dig>  cro10; stx <dig> converting phage i, cro <dig> and p <dig>  cro <dig>  all the diversity seen across the ci variants and the lack of association of specific ci genes with specific cro genes  has been predicted  <cit> , providing evidence of repressor/operator coevolution. this coevolution has been predicted to drive superinfection immunity groups and thus effect the production of new and novel stx phage mosaics  <cit> . only the cii from min <dig> is completely identical to that of Ф24b; all the other phages in the circos comparison, apart from p <dig> and lambda, have cii proteins that are approximately 86% identical at the protein level. lambda cii has the lowest sequence identity at 36% and no orthologue was identified in p <dig> 

only stx phage min <dig> carries o and p genes  like those carried by Ф24b . across all of the phages, there were five distinct dna replication systems encoded, with little homology shared between each system. o1/p <dig> is carried by lambda phage, 933w, stx <dig> converting phage i and bp-4795; o3/p <dig> is carried by stx <dig> converting phage ii, vt2-sa and stx <dig> converting phage  <dig>  o4/p <dig> is carried by p <dig> and o5/p <dig> is carried by stx <dig> converting phage  <dig> . these two-protein systems would therefore be a suitable additional diversity marker for phage characterisation . the lytic induction enhancer, ant,  <cit>  can also be identified in genomic context within the genomes of min <dig> , vt2sa and stx <dig> converting phage ii  and stx <dig> converting phage  <dig>  . downstream of ant is a gene encoding a protein of similar predicted conformation, roi, which shares its  <dig> amino-terminal amino acid sequence  with roi from bacteriophage hk <dig>  <cit> . in bacteriophage hk <dig>  roi has been implicated in phage lytic growth  <cit> . roiФ24b is identical at the protein level to roimin <dig>  and possesses 99% sequence identity to the roi genes of five of the other stx phages. roi encoded by genes carried by stx <dig> converting phage ii and vt2sa, and stx converting bacteriophage  <dig> are still distinctly similar but share lower identity to roiФ24b ; in all cases the genomic context of roi in these stx phages is preserved. the protein product of the antiterminator gene q is widely conserved  throughout the stx phages, as it is in all lambdoid phages  <cit> . the well conserved short tail of Ф24b is widespread across stx phages  <cit>  due to its outer membrane protein adsorption target that is itself highly conserved and an essential gene in the bacterial host  <cit> . examination of the distribution and similarity of the gene encoding this short tail structure across the sequenced stx phages, 933w, vt2sa, min <dig>  stx <dig> converting phage  <dig> and Ф24b reveals 99% sequence identity at the protein level. this 1% difference is simply due to different start codons. stx <dig> converting phage  <dig> possesses a tail gene with 95% identity to Ф24b.

a jaccard dissimilarity dendrogram  was created from data on the presence or absence of the gene variants associated with each sequenced genome. the dendrogram illustrates the high level of genetic diversity that exists amongst these  <dig> stx phages, with no two phage possessing an identical genetic profile. this further demonstrates the genetic heterogeneity of stx phages previously revealed by pcr multilocus typing of phage pools induced from stec strains .

the most challenging question in phage genomics is: what is the function of the uncharacterised genes that dominate bacteriophage genomes? phage genomes are normally small and compact, and it is likely that many of the genes of unknown function have been maintained in this dynamic pool by positive selection pressure. most stx phages have larger genomes than bacteriophage lambda, so carry more genes that are not required for core lambdoid phage replication and life cycle control. the suggestion that these accessory genes have roles in the fitness of either the stx phages themselves or their bacterial hosts can be made with some confidence.

CONCLUSIONS
over the last 10 years, the phage research community has begun to use genomic analyses to compare double stranded dna phages, most extensively with respect to the comparative genomics of mycobacteriophages or their lysogens  <cit> . bacteriophages are significant drivers of bacterial evolution because of their ability to disseminate dna across their host range, either as converting phages  <cit>  or through both generalised  and specialised  transduction. by identifying genetic variation in groups of phage which impact upon the phenotypic profiles of their hosts, it may be possible to infer biological roles for the numerous hypothetical proteins identified in translated bacteriophage genome sequences.

in this full genomic comparison of eleven stx phages we have demonstrated that no two sequenced stx phage are identical. all of the lambdoid phages are mosaics, sharing genomic loci and genomic synteny, but to varying degrees. the short-tailed stx phages possess more genomic relatedness, which may be driven by their shared host range  enabling appreciable levels of genomic recombination, facilitating efficient recombination of and selection for genetic material carried by these phages. the phage backbone of p <dig> is very different from the other stx phages and may be the result of a productive recombination even between a non-lambdoid and a lambdoid phage, as many key regulatory lambdoid phage elements cannot be identified within the p <dig> genome. however, the shiga toxin genes remain linked to the q gene. it has been reported before that lambdoid phages appear to possess most genetic morons within the late gene region  <cit> , and the stx phages hold true to this observation. the conserved nature of many of these morons, which are likely to confer some as yet unidentified property to their host cell, indicate that stx phages are likely to contribute more to their pathogenic bacterial host than toxin production. understanding these factors is likely to be important to understanding the evolution of ehec and other shiga toxin producing enteric pathogens.

genomic approaches to phage biology provide the means to examine the growing number of novel bacteriophages isolated directly from different environments, induced from their bacterial hosts or identified as prophages in sequenced bacterial genomes. deep pyrosequencing technologies, enabling metaviral analyses of environmental samples, are further driving our understanding and appreciation of bacteriophage genomics and the bacteriophage pan-genome  <cit> . assigning definitive or putative functions to the hypothetical proteins that are the expressed products of the majority of bacteriophage genes remains the main barrier to significant progress in unravelling bacteriophage biology.
