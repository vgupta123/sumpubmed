BACKGROUND
taxol , isolated from the bark of taxus brevifolia <cit> , is a widely employed anticancer drug. production of taxol directly from yew trees remains a challenging problem due to the limited resources of taxus sp.

cultured taxus cells as a renewable and sustainable system are a promising production route for taxol and related taxanes  <cit> . however, the low abundance of taxol in cell cultures has limited their industrial application  <cit> . methyl jasmonate , as an inducer of jasmonates , regulates a diverse set of physiological and developmental processes  <cit> , and addition of meja can significantly induce the production of taxol and related taxanes in taxus sp. suspension cultures  <cit> . several secondary metabolites were also found to accumulate in plant cell cultures upon meja elicitation, such as terpenoid indole alkaloids in catharanthus roseus cells  <cit>  and nicotine/phenylpropanoid conjugate in nicotiana tabacum cells  <cit> . in catharanthus roseus, the meja-responsive expression of terpenoid indole alkaloids biosynthesis genes has been shown to be controlled by a transcription factor cascade consisting of the bhlh protein crmyc2’s regulation of orca gene expression, and thus the ap2/erf-domain transcription factors orca <dig> and orca <dig>  which in turn regulate a series of terpenoid indole alkaloids biosynthesis genes  <cit> . in tobacco, the ap2/erf and bhlh transcription factors cooperatively mediate jasmonate-elicited nicotine biosynthesis, which via the ja induced signaling cascade leads to increased nicotine biosynthesis  <cit> . however, though some mechanisms of the ja-elicited biosynthesis of secondary metabolites have been elucidated, the detailed biological mechanism of meja stimulation of taxane production and concomitant transcriptome changes associated with response to meja remain poorly understood.

rna-seq is a high-throughput and cost-effective dna sequencing technology that is not dependent on a prior description of the genomic sequence of the target species  <cit> . in addition, rna-seq is capable of detecting low abundant transcripts  <cit> , and as it produces millions of short cdna reads, the technology also provides information about the transcriptional structure and the gene-expression profiles  <cit> . recent research has demonstrated that rna-seq is not only well-suited for surveying the complexity of transcription, but also for discovering genes and comparing gene expression profiles in eukaryotes  <cit> .

in this research, t. chinensis cells treated with meja for 16 h  and the control cells mock-treated  were analyzed by rna-seq to describe the transcriptome and reveal transcriptional profiles in response to meja induction in t. chinensis cells. despite there being no complete genomic sequence of t. chinensis,  <dig> million reads  of high-quality dna sequence were generated using illumina technology, a total of  <dig>  unigenes in numerous functional categories were annotated in a eukaryote without the prior genome information, and  <dig>  genes were found to be differentially expressed between the two treatments. these assembled and annotated transcriptome sequences and gene expression profiles were analyzed to provide insight into the transcriptional changes in response to meja in t. chinensis cells, which should help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of meja-mediated taxane biosynthesis and meja-modulated network formation.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and sequence assembly
total rnas were respectively extracted from the meja-treated t. chinensis cells for 16 h  and the mock-treated cells with an equal volume of ethanol , and the poly  + rna from the two samples was isolated, sheered into smaller fragments, and reverse-transcribed to cdna. a small portion of each library was cloned to determine the quality of the cdnas, and then the cdna libraries were subjected to high throughput parallel sequencing with solexa/illumina technology to investigate the transcriptome information and characterize changes in gene expression responding to meja induction.

in total,  <dig> , <dig> reads of 200 bp sequence were generated from the t <dig> sample ; the q <dig> percentage , n percentage, and gc percentage are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated from the t <dig> sample ; the q <dig> percentage, n percentage, and gc percentage are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for t <dig>  respectively. these reads were randomly assembled to produce  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> of 423 bp  for t <dig> and  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> of 407 bp for t <dig> . although most contigs were between  <dig> and 200 bp,  <dig> % reads of t <dig>  and  <dig> % reads of t <dig>  were greater than 500 bp in length .

the contigs further assembled with paired-end joining and gap-filling to produce  <dig>  scaffolds with an n <dig> of 839 bp  for t <dig> and  <dig>  scaffolds with an n <dig> of 812 bp  for t <dig> . these scaffolds were respectively clustered with tgicl software  <cit>  to generate  <dig>  unigenes for t <dig> and  <dig>  for t <dig>  totalling  <dig>  assembled unigenes . these results indicate that the assembly and contig joining succeeded in processing a large amount of short reads from t. chinensis cell samples with relatively little redundancy.

among the  <dig>  assembled unigenes,  <dig>  unigenes were ≥500 bp and  <dig>  were ≥ <dig>  bp, with a mean unigenes length of 744 bp and an n <dig> of 1198 bp. the size distribution for these unigenes was shown in figure  <dig>  we analyzed the ratio of the gap’s length to the length of assembled unigenes. the results revealed that the majority of the unigenes, which accounted for  <dig> % of total unigenes, showed gap lengths that were less than 5% of the total length, suggesting that our sequence data was highly suitable for further analysis. the transcriptome data of t. chinensis cells were submitted in the datasets of gene expression omnibus  .

functional annotation of predicted proteins
functional annotation of the t. chinensis transcriptome sequences was first performed against the non-redundant protein database  at ncbi with a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  due to the lack of t. chinensis genome information and the relatively short length of distinct gene sequences, only  <dig>  unigenes  were shown to be annotated with nr .  <dig> % of the unigenes shorter than 500 bp  could achieve significant blast scores in the nr database. in contrast, the proportion of unigenes with significant blast scores increased to:  <dig> % for query sequences between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp ;  <dig> % for query sequences between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp ;  <dig> % for query sequences between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp ; and  <dig> % for query sequences ≥ <dig>  bp . these results indicated that the proportion of sequences with functional annotation in the nr database is greater among the longer assembled sequences. the gene ontology  terms were assigned to classify the function of the predicted t. chinensis unigenes. based on the sequence homology, the  <dig>  annotated unigenes were then analyzed with blast2go for go classification  <cit>  to generate  <dig>  unigenes, which were categorized into  <dig> functional groups by wego  <cit>  in the three categories of biological processes, cellular components and molecular function . seven go terms: “cell”, “cell part”, “organelle”, “binding”, “metabolic process”, “catalytic” and “cellular process” were predominantly represented . to further evaluate the completeness of our transcriptome library and the effectiveness of our annotation process, we searched the annotated sequences for the genes involved in clusters of orthologous groups  classifications. all of the  <dig>  unigenes were aligned to the cogs database to predict and classify possible functions.  <dig>  unique sequences had a cogs classification, comprising in total  <dig> categories. in these  <dig> categories, r category  is the largest group, followed by l category  and k category  .

moreover, to identify the biological pathways that were actived in t. chinensis cells, all unigenes were mapped in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database and  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. among them, the three most representative pathways were metabolic pathways , spliceosome  and biosynthesis of plant hormones  . the annotations of these unigenes showed a significant transcriptional complexity and provided valuable gene expression information in the transcriptome of t. chinensis cells.

differentially expressed gene analysis and qrt-pcr validation
normalized expression value of genes were calculated by a rpkm  method  <cit> , and differentially expressed genes  between two samples were identified by fdr  method according to audic et al.  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  genes were shown to be differentially expressed in response to meja elicitation . compared with the control , the expression levels of  <dig>  degs were up-regulated and those of  <dig>  degs were down-regulated in meja-treated t. chinensis cells  . examining the ten most up-regulated and ten of the most down-regulated genes, eight of the up-regulated genes have defined functions, including lipoxygenase, phenylpropanoyl transferase and auxin-responsive family protein, and five down-regulated genes have defined functions, such as ring-h <dig> finger protein atl1r and cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase.

go classification analysis of  <dig>  degs showed that a large number of degs were dominant in  <dig> terms, e.g. “cell part” and “binding” , and we showed go categories for up- and down-regulated genes separately . all degs were then mapped in the kegg database to search for genes involved in metabolic or signal transduction pathways. the two cell lines  were analyzed by kegg, we found that the proteasome, vibrio cholerae infection and cytosolic dna-sensing pathway had the most significant changes .  <dig>  degs were annotated by kegg, and this annotation revealed significant enrichment for genes found in metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of plant hormones , and biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids  . this annotation of genes differentially induced by meja will provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions and pathways responding to meja in t. chinensis cells. to validate the rna-seq data for differential gene expression between the two samples, qrt-pcr was applied to test the expression of  <dig> randomly selected degs. qrt-pcr expression profiles of the  <dig> genes were found to be consistent with the rna-seq data . these results further supported that the rna-seq data is reliable.

the meja-responsive activity in jasmonate signaling pathway
jasmonates  are plant-specific signaling molecules that activate several defence mechanisms, inducing a massive reprogramming of gene expression  <cit> . exogenous meja is believed to be a primary regulator of the ja biosynthesis and ja signaling pathways in plants, and has been studied extensively in solanum lycopersicumnicotiana tabacum <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> .

we mapped all the defined genes encoding enzymes for ja biosynthesis and in ja signaling pathways to find highly similar unigenes in the transcriptome of t. chinensis cells. gene expression of seven ja biosynthesis-related genes   <cit>  and three ja-signal pathway-related genes   <cit>  have been validated by qrt-pcr . the results show that the mrna levels of these genes were slightly higher than those detected by rna-seq. these results suggested that t. chinensis cells have a similar meja-mediated ja signaling pathway as the ja signaling pathway in arabidopsis. the results clearly confirm that exogenous application of meja can regulate ja biosynthesis and ja signaling pathway in t. chinensis cells.

meja effects hormone and phenylpropanoids biosynthesis
meja can induce jasmonate  biosynthesis and steer the ja signaling pathway to activate several defence mechanisms and hormone biosynthesis in plant cells  <cit> . our rna-seq data showed that  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were annotated as having roles in the biosynthesis of plant hormones .

additionally, the annotation of rna-seq data showed that  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were involved in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids . these compounds are used in plant defence to create physical and chemical barriers against infection, and as molecules involved in the local and systemic signaling of defence gene induction  <cit> . unigenes related to key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway  <cit>  were differential expressioned in meja-treated t. chinensis cells and the mock-treated cells, such as l-phenylalanine ammonialyase , cinnamate 4-hydoxylase , 4-coumarate coa ligase , chalcone synthase , chalcone flavavone isomerase , flavanone 3-hydroxylase  and dihydroflavonol reductase . these results suggest that meja affection of defence responses, hormone biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis identified in other plant species is also found in t. chinensis cells.

meja-responsive transcription factors in t. chinensis cells
transcription factors  regulate the spatio-temporal expression of responsive genes to abiotic and biotic stresses in the defence mechanisms of plants  <cit> . our sequence data showed that  <dig> unigenes were annotated to encode putative tfs , including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . these  <dig> unigenes differentially expressed in response to meja elicitation were largely represented by the tf families regulating secondary metabolism and stress responses in plants, e.g. myb superfamily , ap <dig> superfamily  and bhlh superfamily . the  <dig> most differentially up-regulated unigenes encoding tfs were spl <dig> , hb- <dig>  myc-like protein , mybj <dig> , erf <dig> transcription factor , wox <dig> , ap2-erebp , heat stress transcription factor  <dig>  and two ap2/erf . abundant unigenes encoding putative tfs responding to meja elicitation showed that transcription regulation played a key role in meja-mediated taxol biosynthesis and the formation of meja-mediated response network in t. chinensis cells.

meja increases terpenoid biosynthesis
terpenoids are the most abundant and structurally diverse group of plant secondary metabolites and are derived from the universal precursor isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate   <cit> . all known genes associated with ipp biosynthesis were mapped in the rna-seq atlas of t. chinensis cells, and several unigenes respectively corresponding to these genes were present . some unigenes corresponding to geranyl diphosphate  synthase, farnesyl diphosphate  synthase and geranylgeranyl diphosphate  synthase, which regulate the flux of terpenoid biosynthesis, were also present in the transcriptome data . additionally, our sequence data revealed that  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were annotated as terpenoid biosynthesis pathway members. among them,  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and steroids;  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were involved in the biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from terpenoid and polyketide;  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis;  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were involved in diterpenoid biosynthesis; and  <dig> unigenes, including  <dig> degs, were involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis . in summary,  an abundance of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis was present in the transcriptome of t. chinensis cells,  many genes involved in others secondary metabolic pathways, such as alkaloids and polyketides biosynthesis pathway were also found to be present in t. chinensis, and  the expression of genes involved in secondary metabolites in t. chinensis cells was induced by exogenous meja.

transcriptional control of taxane biosynthesis is regulated by meja elicitation
all taxanes arise from geranylgeranylpyrophosphate , a universal precursor for diterpene biosynthesis. about  <dig> biosynthetic enzymes are needed to form taxol from ggpp including taxadiene synthase , eight cytochrome p <dig> oxygenases, three coa-dependent acylations and several other enzymes  <cit> , as well as several undefined enzymes in the taxol biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . our sequence data showed that all of the previously defined genes for taxol biosynthesis were present in the transcriptome data of both t <dig> and t <dig> and the mrna levels of most of them were higher in t <dig> than t0: unigenes corresponding to ts, t5αh, tat and t7βh, t10βh were strongly up-regulated, unigenes corresponding to dbat, pam, dbtnbt and bapt were slightly up-regulated, whereas unigenes corresponding to t2αh, t13αh and tbt were not distinctly up-regulated at 16 h after meja elicitation . gene expression of  <dig> selected taxol biosynthesis genes were validated by qrt-pcr . the results show that the expression profiles of these genes were consistent with the rna-seq data. these results clearly confirm that taxane biosynthesis is regulated by meja elicitation in t. chinensis cells, and further supported that the rna-seq data is reliable.

interestingly, we found that several unigenes were identified to correspond to hydroxylase, epoxidase, dehydrogenase and coa ligase , which provided candidates of presumptive biosynthetic enzymes for the remaining steps in taxol biosynthesis pathways such as c1β-hydroxylase, c9α-hydroxylase, cytochrome p <dig> c2’-side-chain hydroxylase, c <dig>  c20-epoxidase, pyridine nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase, and β-phenylalanoyl coa ligase  <cit> .

discussion
in taxus cells, meja can effectively increase the production levels of taxol and other taxanes  <cit> , although our understanding of the meja-mediated regulation of taxol biosynthesis is limited. therefore, clarification of meja-mediated regulation mechanism of taxane biosynthesis and identification of genes whose regulation by meja is not yet recognised and genes whose products control taxane synthesis are needed.

our results showed that t. chinensis cells 16 h after meja elicitation were characterized by maximum mrna levels and all known genes involved in taxol biosynthesis were found, which was consistent with results reported in t. cuspidata cells under similar meja treatment conditions  <cit> . to investigate the molecular mechanisms of meja-mediated taxane biosynthesis and gain more information on meja-responsive genes, we used the meja-treated t. chinensis cells  and the mock-treated cells  for rna-seq analysis to profile their transcriptome and transcriptional alterations in response to meja elicitation. more than  <dig> million sequence reads were generated and each of the two samples was represented by at least  <dig> million reads in which the tag density was sufficient for qualitative analysis of gene expression  <cit> . due to the lack of available genome sequence for taxus sp., the sequence reads were not aligned to the reference genome to determine the genomic locations and distribution. we identified and annotated these sequences by using a series of bioinformatics tools to produce  <dig>  unigenes including  <dig>  differentially expressed in response to meja. all of the known genes involved in the ja biosynthetic and the ja signaling pathways could be identified, which suggested that the ja signaling pathway existed in the t.chinensis cells. many studies had shown that application of exogenous meja induces the ja signaling pathway in several plants  <cit> , including arabidopsis, tobacco and catharanthus roseus. in arabidopsis cells, meja not only induces expression of genes encoding for ja biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> , but induces the ja signaling pathway. a consistent aspect of induction of this pathway is the binding of the f-box protein coronatine insensitive  <dig>  to members of the ja zim domain  protein family, which marks the complex for degradation by the 26s proteasome in the presence of ja-isoleucine  and frees the basic helix–loop–helix  transcription factor  myc <dig>  which in turn helps regulate expression of a series of ja-inducible genes  <cit> . in this study with t. chinensis cells, our rna-seq and qrt-pcr results showed that the expression of presumptive ja signaling pathway genes  was consistent with the mechanisms seen in other plants, suggesting exogenous application of meja could mediate ja biosynthesis and the ja signaling pathway, thereby regulating a series of downstream genes in t. chinensis cells.

in the present study, the known genes found in pathways that regulate taxol synthesis, as well as a large number of genes with known or predicted functions involved in several metabolic pathways, plant hormone biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as many genes encoding transcription factors were all shown to be induced in response to meja.

in plant cells, one major regulatory mechanism of secondary metabolite production is via the the control of the expression of transcription factors that in turn regulate biosynthesis genes  <cit> , e.g. the orca <dig> transcription factor regulates several ja-responsive genes in meja-inducible indole alkaloid biosynthesis in catharanthus roseus <cit> . similarly, stress responsive transcription factors have been suggested to be involved in taxol biosynthesis. our sequence results also showed that many genes encoding transcription factors were differentially expressed in response to meja elicitation. these meja-responsive transcription factors may directly or indirectly regulate the production or activity of taxol biosynthetic enzymes; thus characterization of the degs which encode transcription factors might shed light on the regulation of taxol biosynthesis in taxus.

although structural elucidation of taxol has been extensively studied, taxol biosynthesis still needs to be further elucidated  <cit> . to better understand taxol biosynthesis and the regulation and origins of this pathway, croteau et al.  <cit>  identified genes encoding two previously uncharacterized cytochrome p <dig> taxoid hydroxylases and provided candidate genes for all but one of the remaining six steps by random sequencing of a t. cuspidata cdna library from t. cuspidata cells 16 h after treatment with meja. by utilizing “pyrosequencing technology” with samples derived from the needles of t. cuspidata, wu et al.  <cit>  annotated about  <dig>  unique sequences and identified candidates for the taxol biosynthetic genes from the needles of t. cuspidata. in addition, through a high throughput sequencing technology, qiu et al.  <cit>  found that t. chinensis cells have a complex and diverse small rna population and exogenous meja significantly affected the expression of specific mirnas in t. chinensis cells. hao et al.  <cit>  obtain a large number of unigenes by using illumina second generation sequencing in the study of tissue specific taxus transcriptome. our rna-seq data also provided available candidate genes of presumptive biosynthetic enzymes for the all remaining steps in taxol biosynthesis pathway. the molecular cloning and characterization of these candidate genes will further elucidate the taxol biosynthesis pathway in taxus.

CONCLUSIONS
using illumina sequencing technology, we investigated the poly  + transcriptome of the meja-treated t. chinensis cells versus mock-treated cells and produced  <dig>  assembled unigenes with  <dig>  unigenes that could be annotated compared to other known genes from other plant species. analysis of the annotated unigenes showed a significant transcriptional complexity in t. chinensis cells and provided more information about meja response. genes encoding key enzymes in t. chinensis were identified and metabolic pathways involved in biosynthesis of ja, phenylpropanoids and terpenoid were bioinformatically reconstructed in t. chinensis. additionally, the nucleotide sequences obtained through transcriptome sequencing serves as a substantial contribution to existing sequence resources of t. chinensis. particularly, the transcriptome data provided candidates of presumptive biosynthetic enzymes for the remaining steps in taxol biosynthesis pathways. further analysis of the t. chinensis genes annotated to transciption factors will help us understand regulation patterns upon meja elicitation and the molecular mechanisms of meja-mediated taxane biosynthesis in taxus cells. in summary, this transcriptome data will serve as an important public information platform to accelerate research of meja-responsive networks and the regulatory mechanisms of taxol biosynthesis.
