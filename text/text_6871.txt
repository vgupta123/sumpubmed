BACKGROUND
the field of breast cancer research was amongst the first to adopt genomic profiling tools such as competitive genomic hybridisation  and dna methylation analysis in order to investigate the molecular basis of disease progression. studies using acgh to examine dna copy number changes in breast tumours have demonstrated that the copy number aberrations  are not random, but are more prevalent in particular chromosomal locations  <cit> . indeed, it has become evident that patterns of genomic rearrangements differ between disease subtypes, and may be of prognostic significance  <cit> . it is clear from these studies that particular genomic copy number aberrations are associated with tumour grade. furthermore, local dna copy number changes have been shown to cause gene expression changes such that a majority of the genes in gained or amplified regions exhibit increased expression  <cit> .

similarly, regional epigenetic changes involving dna methylation and chromatin structure which lead to or stabilize altered gene expression have been shown to be involved in breast cancer  <cit> . the interplay of alterations in dna copy number and epigenetic states is complex, and to understand the full picture data from multiple sources needs to be integrated. since both copy number and epigenetic alterations result in changes in gene expression patterns, analysis of microarray gene expression data in the context of specific genomic regions is an efficient means of integrating the effects of genomic changes in cancer.

oestrogen receptor positive  breast cancer represents the most prevalent breast cancer subtype, and although several anti-oestrogen therapies are available to treat hormone dependent disease, resistance to therapy is common and the full molecular basis of the disease is not fully understood. in this study we have assembled data from er+ tumours within five published large-scale microarray gene expression datasets and developed a computational analysis approach to score the contributions of genomic regions with altered gene expression to proliferation and hence grade.

previous analysis of gene expression profiles from er+ breast tumours has implicated a set of highly correlated genes involved in cell proliferation as a key prognostic feature  <cit> . this proliferation signature is highly enriched with genes known to be cell-cycle regulated and therefore provides an array-based mitotic index  <cit> . when correlates of histological grade were sought in gene expression profiles, most of the genes selected were those previously found in the proliferation signature  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that the array-based "genomic grade index" was, at least for er+ breast cancer, more accurate than histological grade in predicting clinical outcome  <cit> . we explore the relationship of the proliferation signature to genomic regions that display marked covariant gene expression across a large number of tumours.

patterns of gene expression that are associated with particular aspects of sample phenotype are often referred to as "signatures". this term has been used quite broadly both for clusters of co-regulated and thus correlated genes such as in the proliferation signature  <cit> , but also for more complex expression profiles that involve a number of loosely, or even inversely, correlated gene clusters. like others  <cit>  we have adopted the more operationally defined and analytically useful metagene approach, in which clusters of correlated genes are replaced by statistical summaries of them; here we use cluster centroids . the metagene approach sacrifices detail at the individual gene level in order to gain statistical robustness, generalisability and the necessary dimension reduction to enable higher-level analysis.

the analysis of gene expression data from er+ breast cancer that we present here involves a number of stages. firstly, we describe a novel clustering algorithm  that uses genomic distance together with expression data to reveal regional patterns of co-ordinate gene expression. we show that many, but importantly not all, of these regional clusters reflect common cnas in this type of cancer. we derive metagenes as cluster centroids and we refer to metagenes derived from gdec clusters as regional metagenes . we use regression analysis with the rmgs to identify the most important regions for the prediction of proliferation as defined by the proliferation metagene.

RESULTS
genomic distance entrained clustering
we have developed a novel clustering method, called genomic distance  entrained clustering, to identify genomic regions where gene expression is co-ordinately altered. the algorithm reduces the correlation distance between genes in the same chromosomal neighbourhood in a genomic distance and correlation dependent manner. this type of data clustering is generically known as clustering with side-information or clustering with soft constraints and is more typically used in geographical applications  <cit> . details of the algorithm and the parameters used are provided in the methods section.

to establish the effect of gdec clustering we compared the chromosomal composition of clusters derived from gdec and standard flexible beta clustering, using er+ samples from three published breast cancer gene expression datasets  <cit> . the results indicate a clear enrichment in clusters with a high proportion of genes from the same chromosome in the gdec clustered data . these results were also compared to those obtained when the correlation structure in the datasets was destroyed by permuting the values in each row  in the data matrix. the enrichment profiles for the permuted data are only slightly higher than that expected when chromosomes are randomly assigned to clusters . at the parameter settings used in this study, the influence of genomic distance does not dominate the gene-expression data, but rather reveals genomic regions of correlated gene expression. thus, gdec clustering gives a significant enrichment in genes from the same genomic locus in individual clusters, compared to traditional clustering techniques.

identification of recurrent regional metagenes
a tree-cutting method was used to segregate clusters from the dendrogram generated by gdec clustering. regional metagenes  were then defined as the centroids of clusters containing >90% genes from the same chromosome, giving rise to between  <dig> and  <dig> clusters per dataset. comparison of the metagenes across studies revealed a number of regions conserved in at least four out of five datasets , suggesting that this analysis has identified recurrent biological features. permutation analysis yielded a maximum intersection gene list size of  <dig> genes only  <dig> times in  <dig>  trials inferring a p-value close to zero for the  <dig> genes found in common to the regional metagenes listed in additional file  <dig>  among the recurrently identified regions, differences were found in the extent of these clusters, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  which indicates the overlaps in the regional clusters on chromosome  <dig> for the five datasets. a marked sample set dependency was observed for many regions represented in less than four out of the five datasets.

regional metagenes, copy number aberrations and proliferation
the prognostic significance of the proliferative phenotype in these tumours as assessed by the proliferation signature has been emphasized by others  <cit> . in order to determine the relationship between rmgs and proliferation, we derived a proliferation metagene. for this we identified the cluster containing most of the genes reported in published proliferation signatures  <cit>  in each of the three larger datasets then defined the proliferation metagene as the intersection of these three clusters . histograms of correlations of the most variable genes to the proliferation metagene are given in additional file  <dig>  and the genes that comprise the proliferation signature are detailed in additional file  <dig>  in each dataset the genes that constitute the proliferation cluster form a small shoulder in the distribution with correlations greater than  <dig> . in order to use the proliferation metagene as a continuous marker of proliferation, we excluded all genes with a high correlation to the proliferation metagene  from the analysis prior to clustering. we demonstrate in a subsequent section that the proliferation metagene is a reliable surrogate of tumour grade  <cit>  and results in a good separation of grade  <dig> and  <dig> tumours .

to examine the possible correspondence between regional metagenes, dna copy number changes and proliferation we used a study detailing parallel gene expression and cgh copy number analysis for  <dig> er+ breast tumours  <cit> . we constructed a frequency plot for copy number aberrations  from the cgh data and plotted this in parallel with the correlation of the rmgs to the proliferation metagene from the paired gene expression data in this study . recurrent rmgs on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exhibit a pattern in which most copy number gains and losses correspond to positive and negative correlation to the proliferation metagene respectively. however, not all differentially expressed regions showed corresponding differences in dna copy number  suggesting that alternative mechanisms of gene expression regulation, such as epigenetic repression, are important in defining regional metagenes. dna copy number loss and epigenetic silencing may also be alternative or additive mechanisms at regions such as 3p <dig>  <cit> . this demonstrates the integrative power of our approach, and its potential to define areas where copy number changes have real phenotypic consequences.

identification of regional metagenes predictive of proliferation
to investigate if regional clusters of co-expressed genes are predictive of proliferation, ridge regression was used to calculate weightings for regional metagenes when the proliferation metagene was used as the response variable . to validate the method we tested the regression models derived from individual datasets by using the other four datasets as validation datasets. in each case, rmgs were extracted from the validation datasets exactly as for the training dataset and the predicted proliferation metagene was calculated using the weightings derived from the training dataset. in most cases the correlations for the training sets were higher than the test predictions, indicating some degree of overfitting . however, the test-set correlations were all significant, suggesting that the predictive significance of the rmgs and their calculated regression weightings were transferable between datasets. thus, despite sample set differences in the rmgs, there was a repeated pattern of relationships between the proliferation metagene and the regional clusters of co-expressed genes.

the rows of this table represent the test datasets used and the columns represent the training datasets used to derive the rmgs and determine their regression weightings. the leading diagonal represents the correlations of the training models.

regional metagenes contribute additively to proliferation
to simplify the analysis and increase the sample size, five datasets were merged . we used gdec clustering and the tree cutting method to derive  <dig> rmgs, and performed regression analysis as above . the training fit gave a correlation of  <dig>  to the proliferation metagene. to estimate the extent of overfitting we randomly split the dataset into two halves, and used both as a training set to derive weightings to predict the proliferation metagene of the other. this was repeated  <dig> times giving an average correlation of  <dig> . thus, by using a larger dataset we have reduced overfitting .

a key question for this analysis is whether the multivariate regression models used here significantly improve on the correlation of the best individual rmg in the set of  <dig>  the rmg with the highest absolute correlation to the proliferation signature was that at chromosome 8q13-8q <dig>  with a correlation of  <dig>  . the lowest of the permutation test correlations was  <dig>  , and this conservative estimate of the accuracy of the model was still significantly higher than the most informative rmg . we conclude that the rmgs provide information additively in predicting proliferation. as the most informative rmgs reflect common cna's or regions of epigenetic silencing, we suggest that these genomic modifications act co-operatively and additively to produce cancers with higher proliferative capacity.

the rmgs are numbered in selection order. the chromosome, cytobands, position, number of genes and the correlation to the proliferation metagene for the merged 793- sample dataset are shown.

competitive selection of regional metagenes
to investigate the relative importance of rmgs in predicting proliferation we used a forward selection method in combination with sample subset permutations. a hundred random samples, each of  <dig> tumours, were drawn from the merged dataset of  <dig> profiles. for each sample, the rmg with the highest absolute correlation to the proliferation metagene was chosen as the seed rmg. the rmg that best improved the regression fit was then selected from those remaining and added to the model, until all  <dig> rmgs were included. the selection order was recorded for each of the  <dig> permutations and the ranks were averaged to give the final selection order . the cumulative correlation of the fit to the proliferation metagene at each step is depicted in figure  <dig> 

since the majority of the correlation is explained by the first few metagenes added to the model, we ran the selection order permutations four further times with each of the first four rmgs omitted of the rmg set, in order to observe the rank order changes that resulted. the arrows in figure  <dig> indicate the metagenes that most frequently substituted for the omitted rmg. the substituting rmgs that replaced the deleted rmgs were not surprisingly correlated with them, illustrating some redundancy amongst the rmgs. in the first case the rmg at 8q <dig> is frequently gained along with the region at 8q13- <dig> and is highly correlated to proliferation, but was pushed down the selection order presumably because it provided redundant information once the 8q13- <dig> rmg had been selected. this effect caused the selection order to deviate from a decreasing order of absolute correlations. for example, the third rmg selected, 11q <dig> has a lower correlation to the proliferation signature  than the rmg at 8q <dig> . in selection order analyses for the individual datasets we consistently found that the top two rmgs contained an rmg at 8p <dig> together with one of three rmgs from 8q . the rmgs on 8q probably carry redundant information and possibility reflect the common gains of the q-arm of chromosome  <dig> in breast cancer  <cit> . consequently, the 11q <dig> rmg was more consistently able to provide additional, non redundant information to the model than a second rmg from 8q. thus, our method establishes not only the regions that contribute most to proliferation, but also highlights the relationships between them such that the more orthogonal, and consequently the most additive combinations are selected with higher priority.

model validation
the top three rmgs that were selected using our method reflect known genomic copy number aberrations in breast cancer, thus validating this method. furthermore, the positively correlated rmgs 8q13- <dig> and 11q <dig> are in regions known to be gained, and the negatively correlated 8p <dig> rmg in a region of common loss  <cit> . indeed, comparisons of dna copy number changes between luminal a and luminal b type breast cancers, corresponding to low and high grade respectively, indicated that the frequency of gain on 8q and loss on 8p was much greater in the more proliferative luminal b subtype  <cit> .

this analysis approach also highlighted the importance of the hoxa cluster at 7p <dig> , which has been shown to undergo epigenetic silencing in tumours  <cit> . the hoxa genes have been implicated in growth suppression and apoptosis via a p53-dependent pathway  <cit> . the consistent selection of the hoxa cluster on chromosome 7p <dig> in the sequential model building method, suggests that down-regulation of these genes is an additive event and not simply a consequence of rearrangements on chromosome  <dig> 

the metagene at 3p21- <dig>  contains the gene il17br. this gene forms half of a two gene predictor for response to tamoxifen treatment, along with hoxb <dig>  il17br has been shown to be significantly negatively correlated to grade at the expression level in a large panel of tumours  <cit> , and is in a region where loss has been associated with high grade  <cit> .

chromosome  <dig> frequently exhibits gain of the q arm and loss of the p arm in breast cancer  <cit> , with loss of the p arm more frequent in luminal b type tumours. we identified a region from 1q24- <dig>  that was positively correlated to proliferation, and a region at 1p <dig>  that was negatively correlated to proliferation. thus, this analysis can help pinpoint the location of genes that drive cancer progression when amplified or lost.

the metagene at 17p <dig>  sits in a region that undergoes copy number loss more frequently in luminal b compared to luminal a tumours  <cit> . this rmg spans the p <dig> gene and was negatively correlated to proliferation. epigenetic silencing at 7p <dig> and copy number loss at 17p <dig> can both affect progression of tumours with wild type p <dig>  but are likely to be less important in tumours that harbour p <dig> null mutations.

detailed analysis of regional metagene interactions
an advantage of our method is that it can provide information about genes not originally included in the analysis by indicating the relative importance of a region. the fifth most informative rmg at 3p <dig> spans the rassf <dig> tumour suppressor gene. although this gene was not included in this study, the expression data for this gene was found to be negatively correlated with the proliferation metagene and positively correlated with the metagene at 3p <dig> . this tumour suppressor gene is frequently subject to epigenetic silencing via a mechanism involving the regional spreading of heterochromatin following failure of ctcf dependent insulator sites  <cit> . in addition, rassf <dig> negatively regulates the accumulation of cyclin d <dig> at a post-transcriptional level  <cit> , suggesting a potential example of an additive interaction, between cyclin d <dig> containing rmg at 11q <dig> and the region at 3p <dig> . bioinformatic data mining of interactions and annotations of genes within interacting genomic regions can be used to generate hypothesis for functional studies to identify the key genetic interaction within differentially expressed regions.

interaction network analysis of regional metagenes
we have observed that most of the variation of the proliferation metagene can be explained by the first seven regional metagenes, and that these metagenes can be replaced by others initially much further down the selection order. we hypothesised that rmgs at the top of the selection order should carry non-redundant information, and thus be involved in distinct pathways related to common cell-biological processes. this led us to investigate the networks of characterised protein interactions between these top seven rmgs and the proliferation metagene .

in most cases connections between rmgs were largely mediated through a centralised component  comprising  <dig> genes  and  <dig> interactions, the majority of which emanated from a small number of non-metagene hubs . most of these hubs interacted directly with genes in the proliferation cluster. in the case of rmg  <dig> a significant number of direct interactions with the proliferation metagene were observed, with tp <dig> and pafah1b <dig> interacting with  <dig> proliferation metagenes components including cdc <dig>  ccna <dig>  rad <dig> and aurka .

to investigate the relationship between the top rmgs and those that replaced them when they were omitted, a protein interaction network was generated from the proliferation metagene and rmgs  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the direct or shortest indirect signalling interactions with the proliferation metagene members were compared. for the top  <dig> rmgs , the replacing metagene hit a subset of the respective proliferation metagene members, indicating some functional equivalence . interestingly, this overlap was not observed for rmg  <dig>  suggesting that, for the hox cluster, signalling to the proliferation metagene may be mediated through additional interactions within the centralised component .

this analysis reiterates the finding that a number of small changes in a set of complementary pathways driving cell growth and division can act additively to increase cell proliferation. furthermore, analysis of the rmgs that carry redundant information can help to narrow down the list of potential cancer drivers within rmgs.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that a small regional distortion of correlation distance in agglomerative clustering results in the formation of regional clusters of co-regulated genes. we have constructed metagenes from these clusters and used linear regression in the modelling of grade using proliferation as a surrogate. using this approach we have identified  <dig> genomic regions where gene expression is recurrently altered in er+ breast cancers. we have gone on to identify the regions most correlated with the proliferation signature. we show that distinct genomic regions combine additively to enhance proliferation, and that regions can be ranked by their contribution to the proliferation rate in a competitive model. as a result we have identified the differentially regulated genomic regions that are most important in proliferation, and hence grade and prognosis, of er+ breast cancer. furthermore, detailed analysis of the interacting regions has identified a number of possible genetic drivers of cancer that are involved in key cellular pathways. this approach will have utility in identifying and integrating chromosomal regions where coordinate changes in gene expression confer clinically relevant cancer phenotypes.
