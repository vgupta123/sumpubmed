BACKGROUND
plants can synthesize over  <dig>  compounds through various metabolic pathways  <cit> . secondary metabolites in plants are derived from primary metabolites, and their categories and chemical structures are complex and diverse, including nitrogen-containing organic compounds, terpenoids, phenols and polyacetylenes, of which alkaloids, terpenoids and phenols are the most common. secondary metabolites are widely involved in plant growth, development and defense as well as other physiological and biological processes  <cit> . plant secondary metabolites provide many useful natural organic compounds for human use. because traditional chemical pesticides contaminate soil and water, the development of environmentally friendly bio-pesticides has become a popular research focus. however, the development of synthetic pesticides has many problems, such as a low successful rate, long cycle and huge cost etc. therefore, discovering lead compounds  from natural plant products with improved biological activity has become an effective method to develop new biological pesticides. self-defense mechanisms have been evolved in plants, and many secondary plant metabolites are natural antibacterial agents . wilkins et al.  <cit>  reported that  <dig> plants could be used as sources of plant antibacterial agents including ingredients that could kill or inhibit bacteria, such as antibiotics, flavonoids, organic acids, polyphenols and specific proteins. wilson et al.  <cit>  studied the inhibition of botrytis cinerea by  <dig> crude plant extracts and  <dig> essential oils, found that  <dig> crude extracts and  <dig> essential oils provided antibacterial activities.

resorcinolic lipids are widely distributed plant secondary metabolites produced in large numbers. recent studies have shown that they have extraordinarily high antibacterial activity. resorcinolic lipids produced by pseudomonas carboxydoflava can inhibit the growth of many bacteria species, such as micrococcus lysodeictius and bacillus subtilis  <cit> . resorcinolic lipids isolated from cashew apple have strong antibacterial effects on gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains  <cit> . sixteen phenolic compounds have been isolated from the cashew anacardium occidentale  nut shell oil, including various c <dig> phenolic compounds. their antimicrobial activity has been tested against four typical microorganisms, bacillus subtilis, a gram-positive bacterium; escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacterium; saccharomyces cereuisiae, a yeast; and penicillium chrysogenum, a mold. most of them exhibited potent antibacterial activity against only gram-positive bacteria  <cit> .

ginkgo is a chinese-specific rare relict species that is well known as a “living fossil of gymnosperms”  <cit> . the fruit and leaves of ginkgo have relatively high economic and medicinal values. however, its sarcotestas is usually discarded, causing secondary pollution of the environment  <cit> . ga, which is in high level in sarcotestas, is a natural plant-derived active substance contained in ginkgo, and it belongs to long-chain phenolic compounds that are derivatives of sumac acid  <cit> . current studies have shown that the biological activities of ga include anti-tumor activity, neuroprotective activity, anxiolytic and antibacterial activity . these biological activities may make a possibility that increases the utilization of ginkgo sarcotestas and reduces environmental pollution. the potential uses of ginkgo have been attracted many concern. studies of ga antibacterial activity have found that although ga could inhibit the activity of bacteria and plant pathogens, it just showed selective antibacterial activity, with strong inhibition towards to gram-positive bacteria and almost no inhibition to gram-negative bacteria .

the present study employed gfp-labeled strains and analyzed the antibacterial activity and mechanisms of ga c15: <dig> monomer, high amounts of which was in ginkgo sarcotestas and had relatively high antibacterial activity. investigations of the selective antibacterial activity of ga could provide a scientific and theoretical basis for the development of new plant-derived pesticides using ginkgo sarcotestas as the raw material.

the effect of ga  on gfp in bacteria
using a gfp-labeled strain as the target, we studied effect of ga  on gfp fluorescence in bacteria, and the results are show in fig. 1-a). ga  could significantly affect gfp fluorescence in the gram-positive bacteria b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp within 1 min. compared with the results for the ck , ga  at the concentration of 5 μg ml− <dig> could reduce gfp fluorescence intensity in sqr <dig> bacteria by more than 50% within 1 min, and ga  at higher concentrations could almost completely quench gfp fluorescence in sqr <dig> bacteria within 1 min.fig.  <dig> effect of ga  on gfp fluorescence in bacteria. three independent experiments were conducted ; the error bars indicate one standard error. three individual tubes were collected from lb plates, and each tube was performed in triplicate. each bar in the gram represents means of three individual tubes . a: bacteria were incubated at 30 °c for 1 min before gfp fluorescence was measured.10 μl of dmso without the drug was used as a control. the blank was the e. coli bacteria solution without gfp. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p >  <dig> ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p >  <dig>  );  bacteria were incubated at 30 °c for 4 h before gfp fluorescence was measured. 10 μl of dmso without the drug was used as a control. the blank was the e. coli bacteria solution without gfp. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p >  <dig>  )




although ga  could significantly affect gfp fluorescence in b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp bacteria within 1 min, it did not have a significant effect on gfp fluorescence in gram-negative bacteria e. coli dh5α-gfp and p. putida kt2440-gfp. within 1 min, a significant decrease of fluorescence intensity was not detected in the studied gram-negative bacteria, and fluorescence intensity values in the ck were close to the fluorescence intensity value in bacteria supplemented with ga.

we extended the contact time of gram-negative bacteria e. coli dh5α-gfp and p. putida kt2440-gfp with ga  to 4 h. the results  showed that even with longer incubation times, ga could only reduce gfp fluorescence in gram-negative bacteria by a small amount. ga  at the concentration of 500 μg ml− <dig> had the most significant effect on fluorescence in e. coli dh5α-gfp, causing approximately 30% fluorescence reduction. the fluorescence reduction values at other concentrations were all less than 25%.

the scanning electron microscopy examination showed that after the addition of ga , the cells of the three bacteria still remained intact without apparent cell lysis . because gfp protein was only present in the bacteria, we speculated that gfp fluorescence decay in gram-positive bacteria b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp was caused by a large amount of ga that entered the bacteria within a short time, whereas the reason that gfp fluorescence in both gram-negative bacteria did not show decay was that ga  did not enter these bacteria in a large amount. the lack of a significant reduction in gfp fluorescence in the two gram-negative bacteria was caused by a limited amount of ga entering the cells.fig.  <dig> sem observation of bacteria cell morphology. respectively,  represent bacteria cell morphology before the addition of ga;  represent bacteria cell morphology after the addition of ga at a final concentration of 100 μg ml− <dig> for 1 min




effect of ga  on gfp in bacteria crude extracts
to verify the hypothesis that “gfp fluorescence decay was related to ga entering the bacteria cells”, the bacteria cells of gram-negative bacteria e. coli dh5α-gfp and p. putida kt2440-gfp were lysed and centrifuged, and the crude lysate supernatants which contained gfp, were collected. ga  was directly added to the supernatant, and the gfp fluorescence intensity was examined. the same procedure was performed on gram-positive bacteria b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp. the results showed that ga  could significantly affect gfp fluorescence in the crude lysates of e. coli dh5α-gfp and p. putida kt2440-gfp within 1 min . compared with the results for the ck, ga  at a final concentration > 25 μg ml− <dig> could completely quench gfp fluorescence in the crude lysates of e. coli dh5α-gfp and p. putida kt2440-gfp within 1 min.fig.  <dig> effect of ga  on gfp fluorescence in bacteria crude lysates . three independent experiments were conducted . the error bars indicate one standard error. all of the tests were incubated at 30 °c for 1 min before gfp fluorescence was measured. 10 μl of dmso without the drug was used as a control. the blank was the e. coli bacteria solution without gfp. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  ). three individual tubes were collected from lb plates, and each tube was performed in triplicate. each bar in the gram represents means of three individual tubes 




similar fluorescence decay results were also showed in the crude cell lysates of gram-positive bacteria b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp . when the concentration of ga  was > > 10 μg ml− <dig>  the fluorescence in the crude lysates of b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp was completely quenched within 1 min. this results were consistent with the results of the gfp fluorescence decay experiment in b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp cells, and suggested that ga could enter the cells of gram-positive bacteria b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp gfp within a short period of time.

effect of ga on the activity of a variety of proteins
according to the pcr results , ga  significantly inhibited the pcr reaction. the addition of 1 μg ml− <dig> and 5 μg ml− <dig> ga  could interfere with pcr reactions, resulting in decreased specific bands, although these concentrations would not completely inhibit pcr reactions. however, when the concentration of ga was ≥ 10 μg ml− <dig>  the pcr reaction was completely inhibited, and electrophoresis could not detect specific target bands. this result suggested that lower concentration of ga  could inhibit taq dna polymerase activity and interfere with dna replication.fig.  <dig> effect of ga  on a variety of proteins. respectively : represents the effect of ga  on the activity of taq dna polymerase. the dna contration at the bottom of fig represents the pcr reaction was inhibited by ga . b represents the effect of ga  on the activity of kpn i. the dna contration at the bottom of fig represents the enzymatic activity kpn i was inhibited by ga   represents the effect of ga  on the activity of hind iii. the dna contration at the bottom of fig represents the enzymatic activity hind iii was inhibited by ga   represents the effect of ga  on the activity of ecor i. the dna contration at the bottom of fig represents the enzymatic activity ecor i was inhibited by ga  lane  <dig>  ck; lane  <dig>  addition of dmso into pcr or digestion system; lane  <dig>  addition of 1 μg ml− <dig> ga  into pcr or digestion system; lane  <dig>  addition of 5 μg ml− <dig> ga  into pcr or digestion system; lane  <dig>  addition of 10 μg ml− <dig> ga  into pcr or digestion system; lane  <dig>  addition of 25 μg ml− <dig> ga  into pcr or digestion system; lane  <dig>  addition of 50 μg ml− <dig> ga  into pcr or digestion system




restriction digestion electrophoresis results showed that ga  could significantly inhibit the enzymatic activity of kpn i, hind iii and ecor i . ga  at a final concentration of 1 μg ml− <dig> could partially inhibit the enzymatic activity of the three restriction enzymes. when the concentration of ga  was > 5 μg ml− <dig>  the enzymatic activity of the three restriction enzymes were inhibited almost completely, and the super coiled puc <dig> plasmid was barely digested.

ga  could significantly inhibit sod enzyme activity and β-galactosidase activity . when the final concentration of ga  was 1 μg ml− <dig>  both sod enzyme activity and β-galactosidase activity were decreased by 50% compared with that of the control. when the final concentration of ga was > 5 μg ml− <dig>  sod enzyme activity and β-galactosidase enzyme activity were almost undetectable.fig.  <dig> effect of ga  on the activity of sod and β-galactosidase. the error bars indicate one standard error. a: effect of ga  on the activity of sod.the optical density  <dig> values were measured. 5 μl of dmso  was used as a control. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data ; : effect of ga  on the activity of β-galactosidase. the od value at 420 nm was read. 5 μl of dmso  was used as a control. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data . three individual tubes were collected from lb plates, and each tube was performed in triplicate. each bar in the gram represents means of three individual tubes 




these proteins had different sources and were selected randomly. thus, the results of this study suggested that the inhibition of ga  on protein activities was non-selective.

inhibition of isotope incorporation experiments
the aforementioned experiments showed that ga could inhibit dna polymerase function in vitro. however, it was unclear whether ga had a similar function in bacteria, including whether ga  could inhibit dna polymerase activity in vivo, which would inhibit dna replication. in addition, it is unclear whether ga could inhibit rna polymerase and ribosome activities, which would inhibit transcription and translation. to further clarify the mechanism of ga , we used the method of the inhibition of isotope incorporation to verify the effects of ga  in vivo.  thymine , 3h-uridine  and 3h-tyrosine  were used as precursors to determine effect of ga  on the biosynthesis of dna, rna and b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> proteins. the results are showed in fig.  <dig>  compared with that of the control, ga  could inhibit dna replication, rna synthesis and protein synthesis to different extents under all three concentrations . when the concentration of ga  reached 25 μg ml− <dig>  the inhibition of  tdr incorporation was approximately 99%, of  ur incorporation was approximately 90%, and of protein precursor  tyrosine was approximately 85%. these data indicated that ga  could inhibit dna replication in vivo as well as rna transcription and protein synthesis.fig.  <dig> effect of ga  on the incorporation of precursors for the synthesis of macromolecules in b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig>  the error bars indicate one standard error. the final concentrations of ga in the reaction system were 25 μg ml− <dig>  10 μg ml− <dig> and 5 μg ml− <dig>  respectively. 5 μl of dmso  was used as a control. all of the treatments were conducted at 37 °c in a shaker. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p =  <dig>  ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  ). three individual tubes were collected from lb plates, and each tube was performed in triplicate. each bar in the gram represents means of three individual tubes 




the interception of ga by gram-negative bacteria cell walls
using e. coli as the target, lysozyme was used to destroy the peptidoglycan structure in the cell wall and thus e. coli dh5α-gfp protoplasts were obtained. effect of ga  on gfp fluorescence in the protoplast within 1 minute was measured. the results  showed that when the final concentration of c15: <dig> was lower than 25 μg ml− <dig>  it did not have significant effect on gfp fluorescence in protoplasts. when the final concentration of ga was ≥ 25 μg ml− <dig>  the decreased gfp fluorescence intensity in the protoplasts was found. it was positively correlated with increasing concentration of ga. when the final concentration of ga reached 500 μg ml− <dig>  the gfp fluorescence intensity in the protoplasts decreased to approximately 80% of the control. this result suggested that after the peptidoglycan structure in the gram-negative bacteria cell wall was destroyed, a small amount of high concentration ga could enter the gram-negative bacteria cell and produce a low level of gfp fluorescence decay.fig.  <dig> effect of ga  on gfp fluorescence in the protoplasts of e. coli dh5α-gfp . three independent experiments were conducted ; the error bars indicate one standard error. 5 μl of dmso  was used as a control. the blank was e. coli protoplast solution without gfp. all the tests were incubated at 30 °c for 1 min. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p >  <dig>  ). three individual tubes were collected from lb plates, and each tube was performed in triplicate. each bar in the gram represents means of three individual tubes 




by soaking e. coli cells in ethanol solution for a short period of time, the lipid-soluble components  in the cell wall were removed/partially removed. effect of ga  on gfp fluorescence in the e. coli cells that did not have lipid-soluble components in their cell walls, was measured. the results  showed that when the final concentration of ga reaches was 5 μg ml− <dig>  a large degree decrease of gfp fluorescence in e. coli occurred. when the final concentration of ga was above 10 μg ml− <dig>  it could completely quench the gfp fluorescence in e. coli. however, if the lipid-soluble components were not removed from the e. coli bacteria cell wall, even the final concentration of ga at 500 μg ml− <dig> could not quench the gfp fluorescence . these results showed that the lipid-soluble components in gram-negative bacteria cell walls could intercept ga.fig.  <dig> effect of ga  on gfp fluorescence in e. coli dh5α-gfp , in which the lipids have been removed from the strains’ cell wall. three independent experiments were conducted . the error bars indicate one standard error. 5 μl of dmso  was used as a control. the blank was e. coli bacteria solution without gfp . all the tests were incubated at 30 °c for 1 min. one-way anova was used for analyzing the data ; f <dig>  =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  ). three individual tubes were collected from lb plates, and each tube was performed in triplicate. each bar in the gram represents means of three individual tubes 




discussion
in this study, e. coli dh5α, e. coli o157: h <dig>  p. putida kt <dig>  p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  r. solanacearum, rhodococcus rha <dig>  s. thermophilus nd <dig>  s. aureus and other common strains were used to study the antibacterial activity of ga , and ga was found to have significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria but little effect on the growth of gram-negative bacteria. a relatively strong selective antibacterial mechanism of ga was observed. the mic value of b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> was the smallest among all of the tested gram-positive bacteria. however, its mbc value  was the largest among all of the tested gram-positive bacteria. these results might be caused by small amount of endospores that were generated when b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> was cultured. endospores had relatively strong resistance, and could withstand higher concentrations of ga without being killed. therefore, b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> had significantly higher mbc values than other gram-positive bacteria. the antibacterial activity of ga has been reported these years. himejima and kubo  <cit>  found that 2-hydroxy-6- salicylic  showed lower mics  against gram-positive bacteria and higher mics  against gram-negative bacteria. choi et al.  <cit>  also showed that ga  had significant antibacterial activity against  <dig> g-positive vancomycin-resistant. the results of the present study are consistent with above studies.

additional studies on antibacterial mechanisms using gfp fluorescence-labeled gram-positive bacteria b. amyloliquefaciens sqr <dig> and gfp-labeled gram-negative bacteria e. coli dh5α and p. putida kt <dig> showed that ga  could significantly affect gfp fluorescence in the cells of gram-positive b. amyloliquefaciens sqr9-gfp, whereas it had no significant effect on gfp fluorescence in the cells of gram-negative bacteria e. coli dh5α-gfp and p. putida kt2440-gfp. the green fluorescent protein  has been widely used as a highly useful tool in the fluorescence studies of living cells, which is found in cell cytoplasm of jellyfish and is an extremely stable protein with  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . the fluorescence produced by gfp was caused by its protein conformation. in general, as long as the protein conformation of gfp did not change, the fluorescence would not decay or disappear. previous reports showed that ga and sumac acids, which had a similar structure, could affect the activity of numerous enzymes, including protein phosphatase, lipoxygenase and histone acetyltransferase . in addition, ga affected in vivo regulation mechanism of small ubiquitin-related modifier  and altered protein conformation, thereby affecting protein expression  <cit> .

according to the above test, we suggested that the mechanism by which ga  decayed gfp fluorescence was through conformation changes in the gfp protein. in addition, the mechanism by which ga promoted antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria was through conformational changes of the proteins in the bacteria that inactivated the proteins and inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria.

the results of crude cell lysate experiments showed that gfp fluorescence decay might be related to the interaction between gfp and ga. the gfp fluorescence in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria crude lysates was quenched by ga in a short period of time, which indicated that gfp fluorescence would be quenched as long as it had contact with ga and was not related to the microorganism tagged with gfp. because the structure between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria was similar and results showed that peptidoglycan in gram-positive bacteria could not prevent ga  from entering the cell, we suggested that the peptidoglycan structure of gram-negative bacteria also could not block ga  from entering the cell. in the protoplast experiment, a small amount of ga molecules could enter the cells after the peptidoglycan structure in e. coli cell wall was destroyed by lysozyme, which might be the result of the action of lysozyme. after the peptidoglycan structure was destroyed by lysozyme, pores might be present on the surface of the peptidoglycan layer that allowed ga molecules to pass through. however, only a small amount of ga molecules could enter the cells because the number of pores generated on the surface of the peptidoglycan layer was low, and the surface of gram-negative bacteria was still covered by a large amount of lipids , which could intercept a large amount of ga molecules. in order to further confirm lipid-soluble components in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria intercept the majority of ga molecules, the studies use high resolution electron microscopy to observe membrane change or other methods to study transport of ga through membrane will be carried out.

some studies demonstrated that ga markedly inhibited the biofilm formation of s. mutans and escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  and disrupted biofilm integrity  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that the ga may affect the secondary metabolism of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. due to the secondary metabolism of bacteria, such as the formation of biofilm, fluorescence formation and synthesis of antibiotics are regulated by quorum-sensing, further studies on this section will be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
ga  has a relatively strong selective antibacterial mechanism, which significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria but little effect on the growth of gram-negative bacteria. additional studies on antibacterial mechanisms showed that ga  could inhibit the activities of the selected proteins to a certain degree, and non-selectively induce protein conformational changes. ga  also inhibit dna replication in vivo as well as rna transcription and protein synthesis. thus, we suggested that the mechanism by which ga  promoted antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria was through conformational changes of the proteins in the bacteria that inactivated the proteins and inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria. the research results indicated that lipid-soluble components  in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria intercepted the majority of ga molecules, whereas the peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall showed a reduced capacity to intercept ga molecules.
