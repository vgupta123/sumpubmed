BACKGROUND
the vast majority of flowering plants likely have a polyploid origin  <cit> . the homeologous chromosomal regions resulting from these large-scale duplication events are subject to a wide range of structural changes including accumulation of indels  <cit> , illegitimate recombination  <cit> , gene loss, rearrangements, gene duplications and nucleotide divergence  <cit> . in addition, they are also subject to gene conservation  <cit> . analyses of homeologous regions in maize provids clear evidence of fractionation following duplication  <cit> . however, this is not clearly the case for cotton. an analysis of homologous regions in cotton found extensive genic and intergenic conservation with differences found only in transposable elements and small indels  <cit> .

soybean  merr.) was characterized early as an ancient polyploid through genetic mapping studies that identified homeologous chromosome regions based upon duplicate rflp markers  <cit> . in addition to mapping studies, analysis of bac-end sequences has suggested that the retained duplicate regions of the soybean genome still share sequence homeology  <cit> . similarly, hybridization based approaches showed fairly extensive sequence identity between rflp anchored paralogous bacs  <cit> . approximately  <dig> duplicate genes were identified in the soybean est collections and estimates of synonymous distances between gene pairs suggested that soybean has undergone at least two rounds of large-scale duplication at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . although the origin of the duplications giving rise to homeologous genes is difficult to determine  <cit>  it was assumed that they arose through large-scale duplication events such as polyploidy. cytogenetic studies have shown that the 'diploid' glycine have 2n =  <dig> chromosomes while other papilionoids have 2n =  <dig> or  <dig> suggesting at least one large-scale genome duplication  <cit> . in addition, segmental duplications in soybean were observed using fluorescence in situ hybridization  <cit>  and a more recent fish analyses reveals near chromosomal-level homeology along chromosome  <dig>  and another unidentified chromosome, with only a few instances of disrupted colinearity  <cit> .

limited sequence comparisons have been conducted from homeologous regions of the soybean genome. schlueter et al.  <cit>  compared bac sequences containing ω- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  genes and found extensive gene conservation in both order and orientation between two bacs from homeologous regions with only one large inversion to distinguish their structures. another study involving homeologous regions containing an n-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase  gene cluster gave similar results with nucleotide identity between most genes upwards of 95%  <cit> . these high levels of sequence identity between homeologous regions have been suggested as a potential source of error during whole genome shotgun sequence assembly in a paleopolyploid species.

recently, the doe-jgi and the usda jointly announced that the soybean genome was to be sequenced through a whole-genome shotgun  approach  <cit> . since little is known about the structure, organization, similarity and full extent of the duplications within the soybean genome, questions remain about the efficacy of a resulting assembly of these sequences. in this study, we identified, sequenced and characterized  <dig> bac clones representing  <dig> distinct homeologous regions of the genome. in addition,  <dig> bacs previously characterized for homeology were included  <cit>  in the assembly analysis for a total of  <dig> bac clones representing  <dig> homeologous soybean genomic regions. this collection of bacs was identified as containing genes that anchor potential homeologous regions of the genome. duplicate genes were identified from ests by using tblastx and building contigs as previously described  <cit> . each new "anchor gene" was chosen due to a related role in seed development of soybean. duplicate bacs were sequenced and analyzed to determine the amount of genic homeology. in addition, the ability to distinguish homeologous sequences as will be expected for assembly of wgs was evaluated by merging sequence traces for all  <dig> bacs and ressemblying with varying parameters. each assembly was evaluated against the original individual bac assemblies. our results indicate that the paleopolyploid soybean genome is a mosaic of homeologous sequences ranging from instances of high gene conservation to regions with extremely limited conservation. except for tandem duplications and long simple sequence repeats, adequate nucleotide differences exist between even the most conserved homeologous regions to completely distinguish them during sequence assembly.

RESULTS
duplicate soybean bacs: sequencing, assembly and homeology
shotgun sequencing of  <dig> soybean bacs selected for containing retained duplicate loci yielded a total of  <dig>  sequence traces and a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp of assembled soybean genomic sequence . six bacs  have previously been shown to represent homeologous regions of the soybean genome anchored by either n-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase genes  or by the duplicate transcripts cellulose synthase , galactinol synthase , raffinose synthase  and caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase . to date, this is the largest analysis of homeologous regions from the soybean genome. although most of the bacs were sequenced to completion , seven remaining bacs contained a small number of ordered contigs with fewer than three gaps  and one bac  was phase i with five ordered contigs .

with the exception of bacs umb001-24d <dig> and umb001-5f <dig> that were already mapped by an rflp marker , all but two of the remaining bacs were mapped by either blast-based identity of predicted coding sequence  to previously mapped transcript-based single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit>  or simple sequence repeats  identified from each bac sequence. eight snp markers were identified. six of these markers confirmed already known map positions for gmw1-105h <dig>  gmw1-15k <dig>  <cit> , gw1-74i <dig>  <cit> , umb001-24d <dig>  umb001-5f <dig>  and gmw2-133d <dig> . the final two snps provided map positions for gmw1-57d <dig> and gmw1-27d <dig> . in addition to snps, ssrs derived from bacs were identified, tested for polymorphisms and mapped. only two bacs, gmw1-8g <dig> and gmw1-45m <dig> showed no polymorphisms in the mapping population or any matches to mapped transcript-based snps  <cit> . although there are multiple bacs on linkage groups i and o, eleven linkage groups are represented in this analysis .

a total of  <dig> genes were predicted across the ~ <dig>  mb of soybean sequence for an average gene density of  <dig> gene/ <dig>  kb  slightly less than previous estimates  <cit> . all gene structure predictions as well as the annotations, ab initio predictions and est-based support for each structure can be viewed at the following website  <cit> . on average,  <dig> % of the predicted gene structures had either est or cdna based support, regardless of whether coverage was normalized for gene size  or not .

levels of gene conservation between bacs varied from being gene for gene in both order and orientation, with the exception of an eight-gene block inversion, for bacs gmw1-15k <dig> and gmw1-105h <dig>  <cit>  to very weak homeology anchored by only a single gene . while both of these extremes were observed, more often, homeologous bacs showed mid-range homeology; i.e. approximately  <dig> to 50% of genes in overlapping regions are retained. in those cases, most retained homeologs had 90% or greater sequence identity  with a few extremes. the average nucleotide identity between homeologs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % with an average of  <dig> % while average protein similarity ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % with an average of  <dig> % . it should be noted that when homeologs were also tandemly duplicated on a bac, they were not included in these estimates due to the inability to accurately determine which gene copy was the true ancestral homeolog between bacs.

e recalculated average for just the highly divergent homeologs from gmw1-13o <dig>  gmw1-8g <dig>  gmw1-57d <dig>  gmw1-58k <dig> and gmw1-27d <dig> 

to visualize the level of nucleotide identity between bacs, vista plots for bacs anchored by the rflp a <dig>  cellulose synthase, galactinol synthase, raffinose synthase and caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase  were generated . vista identity plots as well as values for nucleotide identity, protein identity and protein similarity for hcbt and fad2-anchored bacs have been previously reported . nucleotide identity between bacs is strongest in the coding regions and extends both 5' and 3' from predicted genes before dropping to below 50% between bacs with more duplicate gene conservation  <cit> . this is likely due to retained non-coding sequences such as promoter elements between homeologous regions. however, as the level of gene conservation drops, so does the nucleotide identity beyond duplicate genes.

in a number of cases, homeologs appear to have varying gene lengths such as the selenium-binding protein found on bacs umb001-24d <dig> and umb001-5f <dig>  . the exon number for this gene varies and a stop codon in the first exon of the umb001-24d <dig> encoded selenium-binding protein truncates the resulting transcript . there is however, est-based support for the mrna on umb001-24d <dig> extending further 3' but the alignment is not a perfect match . other cases of variation in exon number between duplicate genes are observed . most of the differences can be accounted for in two ways: 1) ab initio based prediction of gene structures with little to no est support vary between bacs and/or 2) truncation of one of the predicted genes due to an encoded stop codon. reliance on ab initio predictions for gene structures combined with the lack of est-based support can lead to differences between homeologs in exon number. in many cases, even alignment to putative orthologs could not verify the gene structure.

synonymous  and nonsynonymous  substitutions between all of the duplicate genes were calculated . the average ks value was  <dig>  and average ka value was  <dig> . again, the ks and ka values for hcbt and fad <dig> bacs are previously reported  <cit> . all ks values gave an average divergence estimate of  <dig>  mya. this value likely is inflated due to the extensive divergence between the duplicate genes identified on gmw1-57d <dig>  gmw1-58k <dig> and gmw1-57d <dig> and between raffinose synthase on gmw1-13o <dig> and gmw1-8g <dig>  when these duplicate genes were excluded from the calculation, the average divergence estimate was  <dig>  mya, similar to previous estimates  <cit>  but still more recent than est-based estimates  <cit> . when only the most divergent duplicate genes are used for coalescence estimates, a date of  <dig> mya was obtained. two caveats to divergence estimates should be noted: 1) the ks values for the most divergent duplicate genes were for the most part well past saturation  and 2) in the most divergent regions, we cannot be certain that we are comparing homeologs and not paralogs  without the context of the whole genome or more sequence in these regions. only two pairs of homeologs showed evidence for positive selection; a ribonuclease hii encoding gene on gmw1-15k <dig> and gmw1-105h <dig> with a ka/ks ratio of  <dig>   <cit>  and the rad-like encoding gene from gmw1-103e <dig> and gmw1-5g <dig> with a ka/ks ratio of  <dig> . all other retained homeologs appear to be under purifying selection for retained function.

reassembly of paleoduplicate regions
to quantify the potential confounding effects of paleopolyploidy on soybean whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly , all of the sequencing traces for the  <dig> bacs discussed above were used in large-scale or batch assemblies. the goal was to determine what effect homeology between duplicated regions will have as the soybean genome is reconstructed. base-calling and assemblies were performed using phred and phrap, respectively  <cit>  with default parameters and viewed in consed  <cit> .

to first test if standard assembly parameters could distinguish between the most conserved homeologous bacs, sequence trace files for gmw1-105h <dig> and gmw1-15k <dig> were combined into a single "batch" assembly. figure  <dig> shows that there is no cross assembly and no inclusion of sequencing traces between bacs. assemblies were analyzed both manually and based upon bac-specific tags to determine that sequence traces were assembled into the correct bac contig. there are obvious regions with high levels of sequence identity between the bacs as determined by crossmatch . even with upwards of 97% sequence identity in exonic regions, sequence traces resolved into their correct "original" bacs. quantification of the "batch-based" reassemblies against the original single-bac assemblies was done using vmatch  <cit> . the three reassembled contigs for gmw1-105h <dig> had  <dig> % sequence identity with  <dig> % coverage to the original bac assembly. likewise, for gmw1-15k <dig> the resulting reassembly contigs had  <dig> % sequence identity with  <dig> % sequence coverage. as these results show, the assemblies were nearly identical to the original bac assembly with the exception of small sequence gaps between the contigs, although clone pair ends clearly order and orient the contigs . extrapolated to a whole-genome scale assembly, this shows that for soybean, unless there are regions of the genome that have higher levels of homeology than has been observed, the conserved paleopolyploidy of soybean will not have a substantial effect on the genome assembly.

all of the  <dig>  traces from all  <dig> bacs were then combined into a single assembly using both standard assembly parameters as well as various other parameter sets. assemblies were quantified using three measures: 1) the number of contigs containing greater than  <dig> traces versus the original  <dig> contigs from individual bac assemblies 2) average percent coverage of the reassembled contigs to original contigs and 3) average percent nucleotide identity of the reassembled contigs to the original contigs . these last two values were determined by vmatch analysis that performed a global pair-wise alignment between all of the reassembled contigs and original assembly contigs as described in materials and methods. under all of the parameter sets, some contigs were split into multiple contigs thereby increasing the contig number to greater than the original  <dig>

b total length of the resulting contigs  divided by the length of the originally assembled bac

c percent identity as calculated from vmatch

d recalculated percent coverage and percent identity to include contigs containing traces from gmw1-103e11; these contigs did not meet the 80% sequence identity cutoff for vmatch

e one contig from gmw1-103e <dig> met the cutoff criteria of 80% sequence identity for vmatch and was included in this estimation. the second contig was included in the +103e <dig> calculations

f this parameter set matches the parameter set that was determined to give the best reassembly of gmw1-103e <dig> as a single bac reassembly. both resulting contigs met the 80% sequence identity cutoff for vmatch and are included in these averages.

experimental parameters were varied in an attempt to increase the percent coverage and percent nucleotide identity of the batch assemblies. the first parameter, revise_greedy, split initial contig assemblies at weak joins  and then attempted to reattach them for a higher overall alignment score. while only barely increasing the percent identity score, the percent coverage score was reduced by just over 7%. the forcelevel flag specifically reduced the stringency during the final contigs merge pass with  <dig> being most stringent and  <dig> least stringent, standard parameters using  <dig>  when the forcelevel was relaxed slightly to  <dig>  the percent coverage was nearly the same with only a slight drop in percent identity. however, increasing forcelevel to  <dig> decreased the percent coverage by just over 2% but increased the percent identity by over a full percent. it also had the effect of reducing the number of contigs from  <dig> at forcelevel  <dig> to  <dig> at forcelevel  <dig>  finally, the minmatch value was adjusted from  <dig>  to  <dig> to increase the assembly stringency, a modification that dramatically increased the number of contigs to  <dig>  as expected, and dropped the overall percent coverage. combinations of these parameter changes also were investigated and the results are given as assemblies  <dig> and  <dig>  overall, it appears that standard phred/phrap assembly parameters return the greatest percent coverage out of all assemblies as well as the nearly best percent identity to the original contig assemblies.

sources of potential assembly errors
two potential sources of assembly error were identified in this analysis. first, under the last three assembly conditions  a contig from gmw1-27d <dig> and from gm_umb-5f <dig> were incorrectly merged at a large n simple sequence repeat region. the resulting contig clearly shows the transition from one bac to the other across the ta repeat with low quality sequences and low sequence coverage flanking the repeat. lower quality sequences are not uncommon with simple sequence repeats that are large in length as these regions are difficult to sequence through. secondly, the assembly of bac gmw1-103e <dig> was especially troublesome in both the "batch" assembly of all of the bacs and on an individual assembly scale. table  <dig> shows how the inclusion of the 103e <dig> contigs  lowers both the average percent coverage and percent identity across the assembly.

under standard assembly conditions, the  <dig>  bp bac gmw1-103e <dig> is fragmented into two contigs, a  <dig>  bp contig with clone pair matches to the middle of the larger  <dig>  bp contig. clearly, a region from the middle of gmw1-103e <dig> is misassembled into a separate contig. this region can be partially resolved without manual reassembly by changing the forcelevel to  <dig> and minmatch to  <dig>  the assembly still results in two contigs, but this is due to a gap in the middle of the contig and not exclusion of a region in the middle of the contig as with standard assembly parameters. the overall sequence coverage is  <dig> % and sequence identity of  <dig> % to the original bac sequence. when this parameter set is used to reassembly all of the bacs however, it reduces the percent coverage by just over 5% but does increase the percent identity by almost 2% .

this then raised the question as to what in the gmw1-103e <dig> sequence could be causing the re-assembly  to generate a second contig from the middle of the bac. utilizing vmatch to identify sequence matches within the region being misassembled, non-retroelement, highly identical unique repeats  were identified. two major repeats occur in tandem in this region; a  <dig> bp repeat that is 96% identical  and a  <dig>   <dig> bp repeat that is 95% identical . repeat a is present in the first unknown gene, repeat b in the pentatricopeptide repeat -like  <dig> gene and both of the secondary repeat copies, a' and b' are contained within the ppr-like  <dig> gene .

geneseqer alignments  <cit>  were generated of each predicted gene structure from this region realigned to the gmw103e <dig> bac sequence. a portion of the ppr-like  <dig> gene aligns to the region predicted to contain the ppr-like  <dig> and unknown genes . similarly, the ppr-like  <dig> gene aligns to a portion of ppr-like  <dig>  all of these alignments were using the "moderate" stringency function of geneseqer. the two predicted ppr-like genes in this region vary greatly in their structures and lengths. as discussed above, often there is little to no est support and ab initio predictions must be relied upon. for this region, the first unknown gene has  <dig> ests with only 90% sequence identity that support the last exon, the rest of the gene is based upon ab initio predictions. the phosphotransferase and second unknown gene have nearly full est support. both of the ppr-like genes, however, are completely ab initio predicted.

although there is variation in the predicted structures of the ppr-like genes, blastp annotation identified conserved petatricopeptide repeat  repeats in both. ppr repeats are a degenerate ~ <dig> amino acid motif that occur tandemly multiple times within a protein  <cit> . to identify potential ppr repeats across this region, meme and mast were used to generate ppr motifs and search the gmw1-103e <dig> bac sequence for all possible occurrences of the motif  <cit> . two ppr repeats were found in the first intron of the predicted unknown gene, at least six ppr repeats were identified in the ppr-like  <dig> gene and eleven repeats were identified in the ppr-like  <dig> gene. these ppr repeats are 81– <dig> nucleotides in length that range from 25–100% similar at the amino acid level and 33– <dig> % similar at the nucleotide level . the black lines on figure  <dig> show the start location of the ppr domains that are located end to end within the coding sequence. these repeats account for the vmatch identified repeat sequences a/a' and b/b'. the similarity of a portion of ppr-like  <dig> to both the first unknown gene and ppr-like  <dig> suggests two scenarios: 1) ppr-like  <dig> is incorrectly predicted and should be two separate genes or 2) ppr-like  <dig> is incorrectly predicted and should be fused with the first unknown gene. in either case, these ppr containing genes and repeats are the source of assembly error, as discussed below.

identified repeats a/a', b/b' and all of the predicted genes from this region of gmw1-103e <dig> were re-aligned using geneseqer to the phred/phrap re-assembled gmw1-103e <dig> contigs. both of the ppr-like gene structure predictions as well as the repeat a containing unknown gene align to a ~ <dig>  bp region in the middle of the  <dig>  bp major contig. this region also contains clone pair matches to both ends of the  <dig>  bp secondary contig. what has occurred is the ppr-containing regions are above the threshold of distinguishing one copy from another and have collapsed into a single structure in the larger contig. the phosphotransferase gene and second unknown gene are excluded from this region and placed in the separate contig. these results show that highly identical tandemly duplicated genes, especially those genes that themselves contain repetitive domains will be a potential source of assembly errors. in this case, the structure of the ppr repeats across the ppr-like genes cannot be resolved without manual curation of the assembly.

composition of whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly
to determine how well our assemblies were screening for highly repetitive sequence, a preliminary assembly using standard phred/phrap parameters of  <dig>  randomly chosen jgi trace files was done. contigs containing greater than  <dig> traces were considered highly represented even after initial trace screening against known repetitive sequences. each of these contigs was subject to a blast-based annotation against the ncbi nonredundant database and then clustered into groups based upon that annotation . surprisingly, 23% of the jgi contigs showed no sequence identity to any anything in the ncbi nonredundant database. however, when the contigs comprising this 23% are blasted against the repetitive database generated by gill et al.  <cit>  only  <dig> contigs out of  <dig> had no match and  <dig> contigs had a bit-score less than  <dig> and were considered poor matches. forty thousand randomly chosen jgi trace files were combined with the  <dig>  bac generated trace files in a standard phred/phrap assembly. the addition of the jgi whole-genome shotgun generated trace files had no effect on either the percent identity of the reassembled contigs  or on the percent coverage .

discussion
in this analysis, we have characterized homeologous sequences from the paleopolyploid soybean genome and studied the effect of conserved duplicate regions on sequence assembly. identified bacs map to  <dig> of the  <dig> soybean linkage groups representing a broad sampling of potential homeologous regions across the soybean genome. previous analyses have shown fairly extensive sequence conservation between homeologous blocks in soybean  <cit> . sequenced bacs identified as containing transcribed duplicate genes show a range of gene conservation .

early analysis of the structure and organization of a paleopolyploid genome have been in maize. the "maize model" suggests that the present maize genome is a result of extensive reciprocal deletions as well as major transposable element insertions causing genome expansion and contraction resulting in homeologous regions that are not well conserved  <cit> . conversely, in cotton, a relatively recent allotetraploid, the homologs studied were highly conserved with only small indels and transposable element insertions differing between regions  <cit> . the "cotton model" suggests strong duplicate gene conservation that extends well into the intergenic regions. in this analysis we find that the soybean genome is a mosaic of these two models with a range of conservation spanning from gene for gene retention  <cit>  to moderately conserved regions with  <dig> to 50% gene retention  <cit>  and highly divergent regions with a single gene conserved .

coalesence estimates suggest that the most of the regions diverged approximately  <dig>  mya. this value falls within the range of what has previously been observed  <cit> . on the extreme end, however, five bacs contain highly divergent duplicate genes. these may indeed be the result of gene translocation, segmental or single gene duplication and not the result of polyploidy. while in the absence of the whole genome sequence we cannot be certain of the mechanism by which these genes duplicated, some support for at least a larger duplication event is found from the genetic map. mapping of duplicate rflp markers in soybean provided early evidence for a major genome duplication event  <cit> . utilizing the most recent genetic map  <cit> , linkage groups d1a and d1b  were found to contain an rflp a <dig> that is duplicated between these linkage groups. in addition, d1b and o  both contain the rflp k <dig> duplicated between linkage groups. while the linkage positions of these markers are separated by many centimorgans , it does lend credence to these linkage groups having a shared ancestry. a similar comparison for gmw1-13o <dig> and gmw1-8g <dig> could not be done because gmw1-8g <dig> is unmapped. regardless of the mechanism, in soybean, there are regions of paleoduplicated chromosomes that have diverged greatly since duplication while others have not  .

size differences between duplicate genes were observed on many of the bacs . even though on average 59% of the predicted genes had some est support, the reliance on ab initio predictions results in variation between duplicate genes in gene structure predictions. a similar issue is observed with the ppr-like genes on gmw1-103e <dig> that are a potential source of batch assembly error. in addition, the varying levels of protein identity in homeologous regions may be the result of unsupported gene structure predictions. this analysis clearly shows that for improved annotation of the whole genome assembly, more transcript  sequences will be necessary to verify predicted gene structures.

most plant genome sequencing efforts have been bac-based using highly inbred plants with pseudo-monoploid genomes . as a result, plant genome assemblies have not been confounded by the effects of retained homeology in paleopolyploid regions of the genome. conversely, many of the non-plant eukaryotic sequencing efforts have been wgs such as fugu rubripes  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , and the celera version of the human genome  <cit>  to name only a few. comparisons between the wgs project and bac-based sequencing project in humans have found that while the wgs provides more accurate gene coverage more quickly, the bac-based sequencing has much better coverage of repetitive sequences, especially highly conserved repeats and in the long run is more accurate in both order and orientation of genes  <cit> . a somewhat similar comparison between the oryza sativa l. ssp. indica  <cit>  and oryza sativa l. ssp. japonica  <cit>  sequencing projects concluded that the major differences in sequence assemblies are due to regions with large transposable elements  <cit> .

the soybean genome is a well-documented paleopolyploid  <cit>  as are all sequenced plants, e.g., arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and most recently poplar  <cit> . although homeologous blocks could be identified in each of these species, even the most recent polyploidy events are thought to be more ancient than what has been described in soybean  <cit> . the often high levels of sequence conservation in homeologous regions in soybean  <cit>  has raised the question of what effect this will have on the assembly of the whole-genome shotgun sequence effort  currently underway.

the reassembly of  <dig> homeologous bacs in soybean provides the first look at the effects a relatively conserved paleopolyploid genome on wgs assembly. the most identical homeologous bacs sequenced, gmw1-105h <dig> and gmw1-15k <dig> are just under 95% identical across both the bac coding and noncoding regions   <cit> . reassembly of these two bacs showed no misassembly of the bacs and no cross-assembly of trace files from one bac in the other bac . in the context of the wgs assembly, this is good news for homeologous regions that share less than 95% sequence identity. under standard assembly parameters using phrep/phrap, paleoduplicate homeologous regions should be resolvable.

when all  <dig> bacs are reassembled in batch, observed assembly errors are the results of tandem duplications and simple sequence repeats. analysis of the re-assembled bac gmw1-103e <dig> shows that tandem duplications of genes such as the ppr-like genes with sequence identity greater than 95% may cause assembly issues. using a standard set of parameters, clone pairs cannot be distinguished, especially when the repeat is larger than the sequence reads . the parameter set that better resolves tandem repeats may not be the appropriate parameter set for all assemblies; as a result, hand assembly of these regions may be necessary for completion of genome assembly. similarly, large simple sequence repeats may cause incorrect merging of regions. it should be noted however, if there are homeologous regions of the soybean genome that are conserved with greater than 95% sequence identity, they will likely behave in a manner similar to tandem duplications and may be more difficult to distinguish.

what was not observed in the batch reassembly was errors caused by retrotransposon sequences. in soybean, many of the potential retrotransposons have not been characterized although a number of studies are underway to identify repetitive sequences in soybean marek et al. unpublished results  <cit> . this analysis, with one exception, did not identify bacs that contained numerous repetitive sequences; instead they were found to be gene rich. bac gmw1-45m <dig>  <cit>  does contain numerous ltr retrotransposons, but re-assembly of this bac showed few errors. cytogenetic studies have shown that the high-copy sequences in soybean are highly concentrated to centromeric and pericentromeric regions  <cit> . in addition, ongoing analysis of repetitive sequence in soybean shows that it is primarily in the centric, telomeric and nucleolar organizing regions of the genome   <cit> . contrary to maize or some species of rice  <cit> , no evidence for a large burst of retrotransposon activity has been found in soybean. it is likely then, that in the context of wgs assembly, retrotransposon sequences in most cases will not affect assembly of genic regions.

preliminary analysis of contigs generated from jgi trace files give an estimation of what repetitive sequences will need to be screened for during wgs assembly . even though the  <dig>  jgi traces were prescreened against characterized soybean repeats, those trace files that contain a fragment of a repeat are passing through the screening process. further, there are enough sufficient sequences that assemble to regenerate the original repetitive sequence into a contig, or at least enough of the sequence to match back to characterized repeats. one previously noted consequence of wgs assembly is that the exclusion of transposable element sequences and repetitive sequences during assembly has the effect of eliminating genes that might be found in these regions  <cit> . in this case, genic sequences that flank or are contained in repetitive regions may be able to pass through the repeat screening such that they become part of the assembly. a balance between screening for repetitive sequences during wgs assembly while not excluding genic information will need to be found.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis has shown that the soybean genome is a mosaic of sequence conservation models for a paleopolyploid genome with some regions retaining all duplicate genes while other regions retain only one divergent duplicate gene. with this in mind, a study to determine how paleopolyploidy would affect whole genome shot-gun sequence assembly was undertaken. our results have shown that even the most conserved homeologous bacs with upwards of 95% sequence identity show no cross-assembly . in addition, potential sources of assembly error were identified as tandem duplications with greater than 95% sequence identity and large simple sequence repeats.
