BACKGROUND
according to the world health organization, over two billion people are suffering from human helmintasis and many more are at risk worldwide, especially in developing nations  <cit> . helmintasis also results in the economic loss of billions of dollars due to damage of crops and livestock every year  <cit> . besides their role in causing diseases, helminths also provide some protection against autoimmune diseases  <cit> . free-living helminths such as caenorhabditis elegans  serve as models to understand parasitism  <cit> . in the case of parasitic organisms, excretory/secretory  proteins play an important role during the parasitic infection as these proteins are responsible for the regulation of the host's immune system for parasite survival inside the host. such important roles played by es proteins make these proteins attractive targets for the development of therapeutic strategies  <cit> .

with rapid advances in sequencing technologies, sequencing data has been generated on large scale especially in the area of genomics and transcriptomics. although short reads generated using  <dig> roche pyrosequencing is the major sequencing technique used these days for generating transcriptomic data, expressed sequence tags  remain the largest resource of helminthic transcriptomic data, with data available for several helminths. dbest  <cit> , the largest global repository of ests, recorded  <dig> , <dig> entries . est data has been widely used for es protein prediction in different transcriptomic studies  <cit>  but most of the studies do not cover es proteins comprehensively, especially non-classically secreted ones  <cit> . also, it must be noted here that although the helminth proteome is directly affected by the developmental stage-specific expression and indirectly by change/decrease of 3'utrs with their developmental stages, the data is so sparse in dbest for some organisms that all available est data from different stages are pooled together for the data analysis reported here. these mixed datasets have been used before for other nematode transcriptome studies like s. ratti studies  <cit> . we have used such a composite s. ratti dataset  <cit>  in our previous secretome analysis  <cit> .

in this study, we compiled ests for each helminth organism, covering nematodes, trematodes and cestodes and predicted es proteins encoded by them, followed by functional annotation and therapeutic target analysis. our earlier large-scale helminth secretome analysis was carried out using est2secretome  <cit>  but the study only considered the classically secreted proteins, based on n-terminal secretory signals and covered only parasitic nematodes. also, the es protein sequences predicted as a part of this earlier study were not provided to the scientific community. we believe such predicted es proteins are a valuable resource for understanding host-parasite interactions and for the development of new therapeutic strategies against helminth infections, for further validation using wet lab assays.

recently we proposed a new bioinformatics workflow  <cit>  for the prediction of classically and non-classically secreted proteins using  <dig> transcriptomic data of parasitic nematode, strongyloides ratti. in the present study, we applied our workflow with minor modifications to accommodate est datasets of  <dig> different helminth species available from dbest, including those also available from nematode.net  <cit> , the largest provider of nematode ests.

the data were cleaned, assembled into unigenes , which were then translated into proteins. from these putative proteins, es proteins were predicted using a series of computational tools, which were further verified by sequence similarity to our in-house experimentally-determined parasitic helminth es protein dataset . predicted es proteins were functionally annotated in terms of similarity to other known proteins, biochemical pathways, protein families and domains. es proteins were also searched for homologues in human, c. elegans, schistosoma mansoni and schistosoma japonicum. the analysis results are made available to the scientific community via the helminth secretome database   <cit>  web portal all the unigenes and es protein sequence datasets can be browsed in fasta format and are available for download. a blast web service is also provided for researchers to check the similarity of their protein sequences with our predicted es datasets.

materials and methods
expressed sequence tags  data sets
for this study, est datasets for different helminth species were downloaded from ncbi dbest  <cit>  and analysed locally.

bioinformatics approach components
our bioinformatics approach has three phases as shown in figure  <dig>  similar to one tested on the s. ratti transcriptomic data  <cit>  where we have used mira and cap <dig> for reliable de novo transcriptome assembly, with these tools now combined by a perl wrapper in iassembler  <cit>  for the robust assembly of both  <dig> and sanger est datasets. we have implemented our computational approach to the large helminth est data from dbest.

phase i: preprocessing and assembly of raw est data

each organism raw est data were cleaned to remove short and vector sequences using seqclean  <cit>  and univec  <cit>  as a vector database. seqclean is used to trim and validate ests for screening of vector contaminants, low quality and low complexity sequences. cleaned sequences were assembled using iassembler   <cit> . the assembly was carried out using a minimum percent identity for sequence clustering and assembly of 95% contigs and singletons, collectively referred to as unigenes. estscan  <cit>  was used to conceptually translate unigenes into putative proteins.

phase ii: prediction and validation of excretory/secretory  proteins

prediction of es proteins was carried out using a pipeline of four tools; signalp  <cit> , secretomep  <cit> , targetp  <cit>  and tmhmm  <cit>  followed by validation with experimentally determined helminth es proteins as shown in the bioinformatic workflow . this approach of computational prediction of es proteins has been successfully applied earlier to stronglyloides ratti  <cit> . signalp  was used for predicting classically secreted proteins applying options of organism category of eukaryotes and truncation of protein sequence at  <dig> amino acids. secretomep  was used for predicting non-classically secreted proteins using default options. targetp  was used for the prediction of mitochondrial proteins with a prediction cut-off of  <dig>  for mitochondrial protein prediction and  <dig>  for other locations. tmhmm  was used for the prediction of transmembrane proteins with default options. firstly, putative proteins generated from estscan were analyzed by signalp for predicting classically secreted proteins. proteins were considered secreted, if the d-score and the signal peptide probability computed by signalp are greater than  <dig> . the remaining proteins were then input to secretomep for non-classical secretory protein prediction. proteins were considered as secreted, if the neural network  score from secretomep is greater than or equal to  <dig> . the combined set of classical and non-classical secretory proteins is then passed to targetp, to check for mitochondrial proteins. mitochondrial proteins predicted by targetp were then removed and the remaining predicted es proteins analyzed by tmhmm. es proteins with no transmembrane segments are considered for further analysis.

for the validation of computationally predicted es proteins, we checked their sequence similarity against our compiled set of  <dig> experimentally derived es proteins of parasitic helminths  compiled from literature  <cit>  using blast  <cit> .

phase iii: es proteins annotation

predicted es proteins from phase ii, were annotated for protein domain and family classification using interproscan  <cit>  including gene ontology  terms option. kaas  <cit> , provide functional annotation by blast comparisons against the manually curated kegg databases. this tool was used for kegg pathways brite objects mapping  <cit> . es proteins were independently also searched for homology matching against ncbi's non-redundant protein database and wormpep   <cit>  using blast  <cit> . es proteins were also checked for homology matching against human proteins. blast was used with permissive , moderate  and/or stringent  search strategies. these tools provide fast annotation of large volumes of es proteins and also reliably used before in other helminth transcriptomic studies  <cit> .

hardware and software specifications
the helminth secretome database  is developed using mysql  <dig> relational database  <cit> . the user-friendly interface is developed using php  <cit>  for blast service and data management. the data is served using the apache web server  <cit> . open source tools used for this study were installed on a ubuntu server operating system based 16-cpu linux cluster  xeon e <dig>   <dig> ram). sequence assembly using iassembler and protein functional annotation mapping using interproscan are the most computationally intensive steps.

RESULTS
our recently developed bioinformatics workflow applied to  <dig> transcriptomic dataset of s. ratti was modified slightly to be applicable to est data. the different components of the workflow were linked by perl, python and bash shell scripts .

preprocessing and assembly of est datasets
initially a total of  <dig>  ests ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  ests for different helminth species were downloaded and stored in different directories on our linux server. according to the workflow , raw ests were cleaned first using seqclean for removing very short or vector sequences.  <dig>   cleaned ests were passed to iassembler for de novo assembly. iassembler is a standalone perl package to assemble ests using iterative cycles of mira assemblies followed by cap <dig> assembly. the tool gives much higher accuracy in est assembly than other existing assemblers by employing an iterative assembly strategy and automated error corrections of mis-assemblies  <cit> . this strategy of using mira+cap <dig> for de novo transcriptome assembly has been successfully implemented earlier for other helminth organisms  <cit>  and therefore, using iassembler is not only equivalent to these two programs but eliminates an extra step by incorporating the running of both programs in a single step. the assembly results in  <dig>  unigenes, comprising  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons.  <dig>  proteins were obtained by conceptual translation of unigenes using estscan . statistics of the est analysis reported here, are provided in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

es protein prediction
firstly,  <dig>   proteins were predicted as classically secreted proteins out of  <dig>  total putative proteins using signalp. the remaining  <dig>   putative proteins, predicted to be non-secretory by signalp, were then scanned by secretomep for predicting non-classical secretory proteins. secretomep predicted a total of  <dig>   non-classically secreted proteins. combining the results from these two programs yielded a total of  <dig>   classical and non-classical proteins which wer then checked by targetp for identifying mitochondrial proteins. targetp predicted only  <dig> % proteins as mitochondrial, at 95% specificity. the remaining  <dig>  proteins after removing  <dig> mitochondrial proteins were analysed by tmhmm for the prediction of transmembrane proteins. a total of  <dig>   proteins were predicted finally as es proteins after removing  <dig>  proteins, which were predicted by tmhmm as transmembrane proteins with at least one transmembrane helix. this number is four fold higher than earlier reported  in the secretome analysis of  <dig> parasitic nematodes  <cit> .

all es proteins that were predicted computationally were searched for sequence similarity against our non-redundant dataset of  <dig>  experimentally determined es proteins of various parasitic helminth organisms using blastp. we found  <dig>   computationally predicted es proteins homologous to known es proteins. to the best of our knowledge, the hsd dataset is the most comprehensive collection of es proteins of helminth organisms. it will serve as a rich source for developing new treatment strategies against parasitic infections and to study the molecular mechanisms of helminth organisms.

annotation of es proteins
es proteins predicted in phase ii were mapped to known protein families and domains using interproscan. these proteins were also mapped to biochemical pathways using kaas. of the  <dig>  es proteins predicted, we could annotate a total of  <dig>   proteins with  <dig>  different protein domains and families. es proteins were annotated with gene ontology  terms  based on interproscan annotations . table  <dig> contains the most represented interpro terms . pathway associations were established for  <dig>   es proteins. maximum number of es proteins belongs to metabolism and human diseases, making these proteins important in parasitic infections . the predicted es protein dataset comprises important biological molecules, including enzymes, the spliceosome and the ribosome. table  <dig> contains the most represented kegg brite objects among the different helminth species .

comparative analysis of es proteins with well-studied organisms
all computationally predicted es proteins were searched for homology matching against the proteomes of c. elegans , s. mansoni, s. japonicum and human  using blastp at an e-value of 1e- <dig>  we also checked for homologues at more stringent e-values  . along with the similarity of our helminth es protein dataset with other organisms, we checked these proteins for interacting partners based on data obtained from intact  <cit> , biogrid  <cit>  and dip  <cit>  using blastp .

our dataset comprises a fairly high number  of parasitic helminth organisms infecting humans so es proteins were checked for homology matching against the human proteome . we found  <dig>   es proteins had no sequence similarity against human proteins and could be preferred targets for parasitic infections. these human dissimilar es proteins were further searched for sequence similarity against known drug targets available from drugbank  <cit> . of these,  <dig> es proteins from human parasitic helminth organisms were found similar to  <dig> known drug targets and represent potential therapeutic targets. these  <dig> drug targets are targeted by  <dig> small drug molecules, out of which  <dig> are clinically approved drugs. these therapeutic targets are also available from hsd.

helminth secretome database  data
all the es proteins and unigenes generated from this study can be viewed from the hsd data page for each organism. along with proteins and unigenes, users have the choice to view protein domain mapping and pathway mapping results. for es proteins found homologous to known proteins, we provide annotation in the form of sequence identifiers along with percent identity and e-value for blast search, e.g. {acantortus_un0312; similar to gi|256096002|emb|car <dig> | hypothetical protein   unverified}. each annotated es protein is also tagged as verified or unverified based on the presence or absence of sequence similarity to experimentally determined parasitic helminth es proteins .

helminth secretome database  blast server
we have set up a blast server to run sequence similarity searches against our predicted es protein datasets . all es proteins are divided into three datasets  based on the organism. users can also query our dataset of experimentally determined helminth es proteins compiled from literature. the input data uploaded can be either nucleotide or protein sequences in fasta format. a text box is also provided to paste the sequences directly into the blast query submission page. the results from the blast search are displayed in html format.

discussion
here, we demonstrates the utility of our computational approach, integrating various open source tools, for the prediction and analysis of es proteins using est data available from dbest. all software used in this study are freely available under academic licence. these tools can be installed on different flavours of unix based operating system. with the advent of next-generation sequencing  technologies, there are many transcriptomic studies completed especially for individual helminth species with good coverage but we have focussed on the coverage of a large number of helminth organisms for secretome analysis. the earlier analysis from our group using the est2secretome pipeline has now been extended to cover non-classical secretory proteins, with validation against experimentally known excretory/secretory proteins. we plan to carry out further prediction of es proteins using more comprehensive helminth transcriptomic datasets from ngs platforms and provide the results through hsd.

biological implications of this study
several billion people worldwide are afflicted by infections caused by parasitic helminths. infections from parasitic helminths, especially from nematodes also results in heavy economic losses worth billions of dollars due to agricultural crop and livestock infection each year. in this study, we have predicted and analysed es proteins from the largest freely available est data of several helminth organisms from dbest.

many predicted es proteins map to peptidase domains and families  which are reported to be involved in virulence activity  and recently, cysteine peptidase expression was studied in a helminth pathogen, fasciola hepatica  <cit> . peptidases are well studied in f. hepatica for their role in migration and maturation of the parasite within its mammalian host  <cit> . another representative interpro protein domain among the helminth es proteins is the transthyretin-like domain . transthyretin-like proteins were reported as novel proteins in the b. malayi secretome  <cit> . the most represented functional class among the helminth es proteins are enzymes, essential for the function of metabolic pathways. protein kinases, which play a key role in signal transduction, are also present in  <dig> species of this analysis.

among the most representative kegg pathways found in es proteins are metabolic pathways . the top energy metabolism pathway, oxidative phosphorylation and the top nucleotide metabolism pathway, purine metabolism, found in our pathway analysis were also reported in other helminth transcriptomic studies  <cit> . the second most represented kegg pathway category among helminth es proteins are human diseases . association of helminth infections mainly by trematodes with cancers has been recently reviewed  <cit> . carcinogenic parasitic trematodes like opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis and schistosoma haematobium were studied in different transcriptomics or genomics studies  <cit> .

representation of es proteins with immune diseases leads us towards hygiene hypothesis  <cit> . it is well known that helminth es proteins modulate the host immune system during the infection for helminth survival inside the host  <cit> . it is also suggested by regulating the host immune system; helminth species reduce the host susceptibility to allergic and autoimmune diseases  <cit> . a number of studies are currently underway to test the association of helminth infection with allergic diseases  <cit> . kegg pathways contain disease pathways from which we note top neurodegenerative disorder as alzheimer's disease and top endocrine and metabolic disease as type ii diabetes mellitus  in our current es proteins, which were also found in other helminth transcriptomic studies  <cit> . it is well studied that helminth infection is also associated with diabetes  <cit> . it was hypothesized that helmintic infections may attenuate the development of cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis  <cit> . with the properties of helminth es proteins for host immune system modulation and involvement of helminth infections in many other disorders, these es proteins demand further investigation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. in our attempt to investigate predicted helminth es proteins as drug targets, we found  <dig> targets using drug bank. ten o. viverrini es proteins were found similar to β-galactosidase which is used for the development of diagnostic tool for human helminthiasis  <cit> . s. stercoralis es protein  was found similar to cathepsin f. a cathepsin f cysteine protease of o. viverrini  has been characterized  <cit>  and could be a potential therapeutic target as in helminth parasites as this protein is involved in excystation, tissue invasion, catabolism of host proteins for nutrition and immunoevasion  <cit> . we found heme as a potential drug molecule for helminth infection targeting fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit. this target can be further investigated as helminths lack the heme synthesis pathway  <cit> .

in the present study we have predicted es proteins from helminth est data available from dbest followed by functional annotation of es proteins in terms of protein domains, pathways and gene ontology and also  <dig> es proteins from human parasitic helminth organisms were found similar to known drug targets but it is noteworthy to mention that only few of the targets are validated in helminth organisms. nearly 40% of predicted es proteins remain unannotated, which needs to be further investigated using genomic and functional characterization studies.

limitations of the current methodology
integrated computational approaches, similar to those used in this paper, have been applied to other transcriptomic studies  <cit>  <cit> . these approaches depend on the availability of data for a reference organism from the same taxonomic order. annotation of the subject organism is based on sequence similarity against proteins present in non-redundant protein database from ncbi and proteins available for well helminth organisms like c. elegans , s. mansoni and s. japonicum. availability of secretome experimental data is another limiting factor for validation of computationally predicted es proteins. in the current study, experimentally derived es proteins from  <dig> species are used to validate computational predicted es protein data from  <dig> species using blast. current validation percentage  of computational predicted es proteins can be further improved by availability of more experimental data. another limiting factor is that we are predicting functionality based on primary sequence annotation alone, whereas protein function is actually determined by its three dimensional  structure. therefore, these preliminary predictions of therapeutic targets from this study needs to be further validated using wet-lab assays.

CONCLUSIONS
our bioinformatics approach made possible the large scale prediction and analysis of es proteins. as a result of our analysis we develop a unique resource hsd  of es proteins for the parasitology/infectious diseases/pharmacy communities. our approach can be used on new large-scale transcriptomic data sets from ngs platforms, for rapid prediction and annotation of es proteins. the approach can be applied to any organism but its main application is for neglected organisms with limited knowledge.
