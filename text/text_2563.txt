BACKGROUND
bluetongue  is a disease of economic importance  <cit>  caused by the bluetongue virus , a rna-virus that belongs to the genus orbivirus of the family reoviridae. twenty-six serotypes have been reported around the world so far  <cit> . although other infection pathways have been described  <cit> , btv is generally transmitted by biting midges   <cit> . the virus may cause a hemorrhagic disease with high morbidity rates, especially in sheep, while cattle mostly act as a reservoir. as an exception, a high morbidity was observed in this species during the recent epidemic due to btv serotype  <dig>  in europe  <cit> . observations during previous bt outbreaks and experimental infections have shown that indigenous wild ruminant species may become infected with and without clinical manifestations and may therefore act as a virus reservoir  <cit> .

indigenous swiss cattle and sheep breeds are highly susceptible to btv infection and develop clinical signs  <cit> . the first btv- <dig> infection in a domestic animal in switzerland was diagnosed at the end of october  <dig>  <cit>  and in  <dig>  like in most european countries confronted to the bt epidemic, a large scale compulsory vaccination campaign was initiated to limit the expansion of the virus  <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> local outbreaks have been reported in swiss livestock  <cit> . a study in wildlife prior to the  <dig> epidemic reported no evidence of btv infection in swiss red deer  <cit> . however, considering recent data from other european countries  <cit> , an update of the situation including more species from the whole country was necessary to evaluate the potential role of wild ruminants in the bt epidemiology in switzerland and assess whether they may represent a threat to the success of the control program in livestock. furthermore, a new orbivirus named toggenburg orbivirus  was detected in  <dig> in healthy goats in switzerland  <cit> . since then, it has been shown that the tov circulates in small domestic ruminants, especially in the southern swiss canton of ticino , and the question was raised as to whether wildlife may be a reservoir for this virus  <cit> . a study addressing risk factors for tov infection revealed a possible association with alpine pastures  <cit> .

in this study, we estimated the prevalence of infections with btv and tov in roe deer , red deer , alpine chamois  and alpine ibex  over two years . we considered potential risk factors for infection such as geographical location, altitude, animal species, age and sex, and we compared our results with data on domestic ruminants. given that blood samples from hunted wildlife are often of poor quality , which may affect reactions in serological tests  <cit> , we investigated the influence of hemolysis on our testing protocol. our data show that wild ruminants are currently not a reservoir for btv and tov in switzerland. we also confirm that recording serum quality of samples from hunted wildlife is essential to correctly interpret test results, and that the use of confirmatory tests is crucial to identify false positive results.

RESULTS
btv infections
out of  <dig>  serum samples  screened for btv antibodies with the vmrd elisa,  <dig> showed an optical density percentage  value greater than 30%, which was the cut-off determined for this study. ten of the  <dig> samples with an odp > 30%  were eventually confirmed seropositive by three additional elisas and by serum neutralization test , with titers against btv- <dig> ranging from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> . only these confirmed positive samples were used for seroprevalence calculation. overall, estimated seroprevalence was  <dig> %  .

number of positive samples obtained with the screening test  and following confirmatory tests are indicated in relation to the hemolysis serum scores  and the optical density percentage  of the screening test. one sample with odp > 30% yielded an unclear result in the confirmatory elisas but to a positive result in the snt .

with the exception of one roe deer , all seropositive animals were adults . there were significantly more seropositive red deer than roe deer , chamois  or ibex . among the sampling units, a significantly higher seroprevalence was recorded in jura-south , and within this unit, more red deer than roe deer and chamois  were seropositive. the elevation above sea level  of the seropositive animals did not differ from the species-specific elevation range for each ruminant species . there was also no difference between the two sampling periods .

mean altitudes differed significantly between species : ibex were found higher than all other species , and chamois were higher than roe deer and red deer .

none of the  <dig> seropositive samples was positive by s <dig> btv real-time rt-pcr. in contrast, btv- <dig> rna was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig>  seronegative samples . these three samples were from two adult chamois out of the  <dig> samples with initial positive reaction in the vmrd elisa screening  and from one adult roe deer from the canton of ticino  that tested negative in the vmrd elisa screening. virus isolation from these three samples was not successful. overall, btv- <dig> virus prevalence was  <dig> %,  and no animal was found positive for tov.

the comparison of our results with documented bt outbreaks in domestic livestock  shows that seropositive wild ruminants were found in a range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  km  around communities with domestic outbreaks. in contrast, two virus positive animals  originated from regions where no domestic bt outbreak has been reported so far  <cit> , at a distance of  <dig>  km and  <dig>  km, respectively, to the next community with a documented outbreak.

serum quality and testing protocol
the time span between sample collection in the field and arrival at laboratory was in average  <dig>  days with a range of  <dig> to 21 days. of all obtained serum samples,  <dig>  were scored  according to their degree of hemolysis . only 5% were scored as clean  and 18% as mildly hemolytic . most of the samples  were classified as moderately hemolytic with decreased transparency , while 31% were severely hemolytic and opaque . as expected, the proportion of clean samples was higher in animals sampled alive  than after death , while the proportion of moderately to severely hemolytic samples was similar in hunted animals  and animals found dead . the distribution of the different hemolysis scores was generally similar in all four species. however, the proportion of clean samples was significantly higher in hunted ibex  than hunted chamois , despite the fact that the time span  between the date of sampling and the date of arrival at the centre for fish and wildlife health  was longer for samples of hunted ibex  than of hunted chamois  . nevertheless, when the animal species was not considered, hemolysis generally increased with the time between sampling and sample processing .

in the screening vmrd elisa, severely hemolytic samples  showed a significantly lower odp mean value than samples with lower scores , and the overall range of odp values was wider with increasing hemolysis. positive results were confirmed both for clean and hemolytic sera . final seroprevalence was  <dig> % for clean samples  and  <dig> % for markedly hemolytic samples , without statistical difference between the two groups, and with even a lower prevalence for only slightly hemolytic samples .

ten out of  <dig> samples  were eventually confirmed seropositive by repeating the vmrd elisa in a different laboratory by other technicians and by two other elisas and snt . the percentage of confirmed positive among screening-positive samples was higher for score  <dig>  than for scores  <dig> and  <dig>  but these differences were not significant. overall, final seroprevalence  was significantly lower than the initial one  even if considering only samples with odp > 50% .

except for one out of the  <dig> samples confirmed as positive after running confirmatory tests, all of these had an initial odp > 50% . thus, the estimated seroprevalence using 50% as cut-off  would have not significantly differed from the one obtained with the cut-off at 30% .

discussion
following the recent bt epidemic in central europe, data on btv circulation in swiss free-ranging wild ruminants were urgently needed for the future planning and successful achievement of the implemented bt control program in livestock. this study provides an overview of the situation in the four indigenous wild ruminant species in switzerland, and it additionally addresses important questions regarding testing protocols for samples collected from wildlife carcasses.

the low estimated seroprevalence for btv in all investigated species suggests that sporadic infection can occur but that btv- <dig> is not circulating within wild populations in switzerland at a large scale. also, the prevalence in red deer of  <dig> % in the present study was not significantly higher  than reported before the european epidemic   <cit> .

the fact that the prevalences in our study were lower than the ones previously documented in other european countries  <cit>  can be due to two different factors. first, albeit  <dig> bt outbreaks have been recorded in swiss livestock between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , this number is very low compared to the situation observed in other countries  <cit> , e.g.  <dig>  herds with clinical cases in  <dig> in france  <cit> . the virus has apparently not spread as widely in switzerland as in other european regions. second, our sampling rounds took place after two years of mandatory vaccination of swiss domestic ruminant species  <cit> , a measure that limited the incidence of btv- <dig> infections in domestic and possibly also in wild species  <cit> .

in our study, red deer were more often infected by btv- <dig> than other wild ruminant species, similarly to observations in belgium  <cit> , spain  <cit> , and france  <cit> . this supports the hypothesis that, although they live in the same habitat, red deer are more susceptible to infection than roe deer. it is interesting to note that red deer are abundant in the southern part of the swiss jura while only few individuals are present in its northern part  <cit> , where most of the domestic swiss bt outbreaks occurred  <cit> . in contrast, roe deer and chamois are abundant in the northern jura  <cit>  but none of the individuals from this region  were positive. this further suggests that ruminants other than red deer have a lower susceptibility to infection or that btv-infected midges do not feed on them as often. in conclusion, it indicates that outbreaks in livestock were likely not related to wildlife infections.

it has been formerly of concern that btv may expand from southern europe through the alps but data from 2004– <dig> did not indicate virus presence in regions considered at risk in the swiss alps  <cit> . interestingly, in our study we found a chamois positive by real-time rt-pcr, originating from an alpine valley , which was sampled above  <dig>  m a.s.l. to our knowledge, this is the first report of btv- <dig> rna in an alpine caprid. it has been shown that there are no vector-free areas in switzerland, and different species of culicoides midges have been detected up to  <dig>  m a.s.l. in the swiss alps, indicating that virus may be able to circulate within the alps  <cit> . although anecdotal, our result supports this hypothesis.

during previous bt epidemics in europe, the situation in wildlife seemed to be closely related to the spread of btv among domestic livestock  <cit> . however, seropositive wild animals have also been documented in regions without domestic outbreaks  <cit> , a situation that was particularly obvious for btv- <dig> in southern spain  <cit> . in contrast to spain, where wild ruminants may act as reservoir for btv  <cit> , our data indicate that wildlife plays currently no such role in switzerland. first, seroprevalences in wildlife are very low; second, all seropositive wild ruminants were sampled in a perimeter of <  <dig>  km around a domestic outbreak, while 95% of the new domestic outbreaks during the  <dig> bt epidemic occurred within a perimeter of 31 km from the first one  <cit> . in our study, two infected wild ruminants were found in areas distant of more than 30 km from the nearest swiss domestic case  but virus dispersion over large distances through wind transport of infected midges is well known  <cit> . alternatively, infected domestic animals in these areas may have remained undetected or unreported. the detection of clinically ill animals in rigorously vaccinated herds and the health monitoring of livestock kept on alpine pastures are challenging. furthermore, one of the two positive wild ruminants originated from a location close to the italian border and may have been related to domestic cases in northern italy. indeed, btv- <dig> cases have been recorded in piemonte  <cit>  but to our knowledge, detailed information on the epidemiological situation in this region is not publicly available. nevertheless, these two virus positive animals demonstrate that wild ruminants, as it has already been addressed  <cit> , should imperatively be included in future bt surveillance programs for early detection of disease.

concerning tov, our study suggests that wildlife is not a reservoir for this virus either. despite the high apparent tov seroprevalence in goats  in the canton of ticino and the fact that tov had circulated in the population of domestic small ruminants in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , tov-positive wild animals were not found in this region.

serological surveys in free-ranging wild species are linked with a range of difficulties including laborious sampling , limited representativity of obtained sample sets , poor sample quality , and lack of validation of serological tests for wild species. poor serum quality can hamper analysis and complicate result interpretation. however, the impact of sample quality depends largely on the type of serological test. hemolysis has been shown to be a major problem when using serum neutralization tests  due to serum cytotoxicity and to the presence of cloudy suspensions interfering with the reading of the test  <cit> . hemolytic and strongly contaminated samples are also considered inadequate for the complement fixation test and serum agglutination test  <cit> , and decreased sensitivity due to hemolysis was observed when testing samples of wildcats with an immunofluorescence assay  <cit>  and fallow deer sera with an elisa  <cit> . similarly, a recent study on suid herpesvirus  <dig> showed that hemolysis and repeated freeze-thawing cycles of wild boar sera can influence elisa test reactions, leading to a higher number of doubtful results  <cit> . in contrast, hemolysis and repeated freeze-thawing cycles have been reported to have only a relatively small effect on the obtained optical density  values of an elisa applied on domestic pig sera  <cit> . however, it is difficult to evaluate which factor is most important when the impact of hemolysis on test results is addressed in association with suboptimal storage conditions. for example, long sample storage time at room temperature has been shown to increase the number of false negative results  <cit> . here, we evaluated the influence of hemolysis on serological tests in four different wild ruminant species. as expected, the majority of the samples collected from hunted and perished animals was moderately to severely hemolytic, in contrast to samples from living animals. we documented that the range of odp values was wider and the mean odp value lower in case of severe hemolysis, indicating a higher risk of obtaining false negative results when applying recommended cut-offs on hemolytic samples. however, only one hemolytic sample with odp < 50% was confirmed positive in other tests, suggesting that false negative results due to hemolysis is negligible. nevertheless, this result should be considered with caution given the very low number of positive samples in our study.

our testing protocol, which combined an initial highly sensitive screening procedure with more specific confirmatory tests, was intended to detect weak positive antibody reactions as expected after a recent btv infection or in tov-infected animals. this procedure allowed us to identify such samples to test them individually for virus rna, while seronegative samples were tested in pools. independently of the degree of hemolysis, a high number of samples identified as positive in the screening test turned out to be negative in the confirmation tests, which was due in large part to the low cut-off value set in the screening test. however, even when considering only samples with an odp > 50%, the use of confirmatory tests proved to be essential to minimize the number of false positive reactions. based on our experience, we recommend re-testing samples showing a weak positive or questionable result. if samples are truly only weakly positive, they will produce the same reaction in the second run; in contrast, false positive results are mostly not repeatable. despite the known limitations of the snt when applied on hemolytic samples, we obtained acceptable results in all cases. this success is probably due to our use of a lower tcid <dig> than the one recommended by the oie, namely 20– <dig> tcid <dig> instead of  <dig> tcid <dig>  this protocol modification has been shown to be more sensitive without a loss of specificity for the detection of antibodies against btv  <cit> . the serial serology testing procedure privileged specificity because only samples that scored positive in at least two out of three confirmatory elisas as well as in the snt were considered positive. however, sample selection for investigation by real-time rt-pcr was based on the results of the screening test only, increasing the chances of detecting viremic animals.

three samples determined as seronegative were positive for btv rna by real-time rt-pcr. in the case of btv infection, viremia can be detected up to a couple of months after infection in domestic and wild species, usually in seropositive animals  <cit> . however, the virus may be occasionally found in seronegative individuals, as it has been reported in red deer from belgium  <cit> . this could be either related to a recent infection  or due to a failure in antibody detection .

pooling seronegative samples for pcr analyses may have decreased sensitivity of the test. however, we were looking for epidemiologically relevant virus amounts associated with a clearly positive reaction; even in the case of a low virus load, we would have expected the animals to be seropositive. therefore, the pooling procedure allowed saving resources without affecting result quality. while the storage of blood samples at −20°c is not considered problematic for the real-time rt-pcr, virus isolation could have been negatively influenced by this temperature. this may explain the failure of isolation from the three positive rt-pcr samples.

CONCLUSIONS
our aim was to assess the role of wild ruminants in the epidemiology of btv infections in domestic livestock in switzerland. our data suggest that btv infections in wild ruminants are only sporadic and that this virus does not circulate among wild populations. we therefore conclude that wildlife is currently an incidental spill-over and not a maintenance host in switzerland and does not represent a threat for the btv control program in livestock. similarly, we found no evidence of tov infections in wild hosts. however, the presence of btv- <dig> in areas distant from reported cases in domestic species suggests that the btv- <dig> situation may evolve in the near future and that wild ruminants could be used as sentinels for bt surveillance. additionally, our data suggest that hemolytic samples can be used for serosurveys, but they underline the importance of running confirmatory tests to refine results obtained by sensitive screening procedures.
