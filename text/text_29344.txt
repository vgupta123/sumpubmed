BACKGROUND
adult human skeletal stem cells  are present in the bone marrow stroma. they are defined by their ability to both self-renew and differentiate into mesoderm-specific lineage cells including osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes  <cit> . these two characteristics make hmscs a valuable resource in the fields of cellular therapeutics and regenerative medicine  <cit> . the potential clinical use of hmsc therapy has been examined in an increasing number of clinical conditions, including treating children with osteogenesis imperfecta  as well as bone repair of non-healed fractures and large bone defects  <cit> .

lineage-specific differentiation of hmscs into osteoblasts  is dependent on a number of microenvironmental cues  <cit> . in vitro ob differentiation of hmscs is induced by a mixture of hormones  and chemicals  and the expression of mature ob phenotype takes place through a series of developmental stages: cell expansion and proliferation, cell commitment to ob, and differentiation into pre-osteoblasts followed by maturation of osteoblasts which synthesize the bone matrix and promote mineralization  <cit> . phases of ob differentiation and establishment of the osteoblastic phenotype are controlled by a set of transcription factors.

a number of transcription factors  have been demonstrated to play important roles in ob differentiation and function. runt domain-containing transcription factor  is the major tf in both osteoblast commitment and differentiation . homozygous deletion of this gene in mice resulted in a complete absence of osteoblasts and bone formation  <cit> . another tf, osterix , specifically expressed by osteoblasts, is positively regulated by and acts downstream of runx <dig>  <cit> . activating transcription factor  <dig>  plays an important role in mature osteoblasts, and it interacts with runx <dig> to regulate the expression of osteocalcin  <cit> . other tfs that have been shown to regulate osteoblast differentiation include: the ap <dig> family of proteins; lef/tcf ; homeobox proteins msx <dig>  hoxa <dig> and dlx5; helix-loop-helix  proteins hes, hey, twist and hand2; and ccaat/enhancer-binding proteins   <cit> . although a number of tfs have been identified to be important in osteoblastic differentiation, this is a very small subset of all documented human tfs. vaquerizas et al.  <cit>  have generated a list of  <dig> manually curated, sequence-specific dna-binding human tfs.

many reported human transcription factors are uncharacterized in terms of their biological functions  <cit> . it is plausible that some of the uncharacterized tfs are important regulators of osteoblast differentiation. in this study, we employed genome-wide expression profiling to identify tfs which were differentially expressed between undifferentiated hmscs and their differentiated osteoblastic cell progeny. by clustering these tfs using self-organizing maps , and by literature analysis, we identified three tfs as novel candidates with possible regulatory functions in osteoblast differentiation. we further explored the role of one of these candidates, znf <dig>  siznf <dig> knockdown experiments showed regulatory effects on osteoblast differentiation. microarray analysis of siznf <dig> deficient osteoblastic cells, identified three highly up-regulated genes, lgr <dig>  mmp <dig> and ranbp3l, and we propose these as possible targets of znf <dig>  we also report that znf <dig> has a krab domain, a transcriptional repressor, which is conserved in tetrapod vertebrates.

methods
cell culture
as a model for primary hmscs, we employed hmsc-tert cells . the source and generation of hmsc-tert cells are described in  <cit> . these exhibit a stable cellular and molecular phenotype comparable to that of primary hmscs  <cit> . hmsc-tert cells were routinely cultured in standard media   with 10 % v/v fbs . the generation and characterization of hmsc-tert cells were as described in detail in  <cit> .

osteoblast differentiation
ex vivo osteoblast differentiation was performed using osteoblast induction medium containing β-glycerophosphate , l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate , dexamathasone  and calcitriol  in standard medium . media were changed every 3 days until day  <dig> 

alkaline phosphatase activity measurements
alkaline phosphatase  activity was quantified as previously described  <cit> , using a 1 mg/ml solution of p-nitrophenylphosphate  in 50 mm nahco <dig> with 1 mm mgcl <dig>  ph  <dig> , at 37 °c for 20 min. activity was stopped using 3 m naoh and the absorbance of each reaction  was measured using a fluostar omega plate reader . alp activity was normalized to cell number, as determined using a celltiter-blue cell viability assay, according to manufacturer’s instructions .

cytochemical staining
cells undergoing osteogenic differentiation were stained at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for alp and days  <dig> and  <dig> for alizarin red  as previously described  <cit> . elution of azr staining was performed using 10 % cetylpyridium for 1 h at room temperature; 25–100 μl was then removed to a  <dig> well plate and read on a fluostar omega plate reader at 595 nm emission wavelength.

immunohistochemical staining
routine protocols  <cit>  were used to stain for znf <dig> . briefly, immunocyto-chemical staining was performed using dako powervision + hrp according to manufacturer’s instructions. the primary antibody was diluted in chemmate antibody diluent  and processed on an automatic slide processor . dab was used as the chromogen and the slides were counterstained with haematoxylin. analysis was carried out on an ix <dig> olympus microscope using olympusdp software v <dig>   or a leica dm <dig>  using the surveyor turboscan mosaic acquisition imaging analysis system v <dig> . <dig> . to assess localization of the znf <dig> protein, cells undergoing ob induction were passaged and replated 2 days prior to fixation  in osteoblast induction medium. this ensured that both the cytoplasm and nuclear localization could be easily visualised. following fixation, cells were blocked and permeabilised  before overnight incubation with znf <dig> antibody. anti-rabbit alexa-fluor  <dig>  was utilized as a secondary antibody and cells were counterstained with phalloidin pre-conjugated with tritc  and hoechst h <dig> . image acquisition was performed on a perkin elmer operetta high content imaging system.

matrix mineralisation assay
deposition of hydroxyapatite was measured using the osteoimage™ bone mineralization assay  according to manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, cells were plated in  <dig> well plates at  <dig> /cm <dig> and induced in osteoblast induction medium for 15 days with media changed every third day. following fixation , wells were washed in lonza wash buffer before staining with osteoimagetm staining reagent conjugated to  <dig> for 30 min at rt. post-staining, wells were washed in wash buffer before being read on a fluostar omega plate reader set at 488 nm emission wavelength.

in vivo heterotopic bone formation
hmsc-tert  were suspended into single cells and combined with 40 mg hydroxy-apatite tricalcium phosphate as previously reported  . non-induced cells were incubated overnight in ha/tcp before implantation into the dorsolateral area of immune compromised mice  for 8 weeks. after retrieval, implants were fixed overnight in 4 % formalin, washed in pbs before decalcification in formic acid for 3– <dig> days. following embedding in wax, four serial sections were cut at three depths with 100um between each group and sections from each group were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, or human specific-vimentin antibody .

sirna-based knock down experiments
lna-modified silencer® select sirnas targeting the desired genes  and non-targeted negative controls  <dig> and  <dig> were purchased from ambion . validation of sirna data was done using a second silencer® select sirna for zbtb <dig> and znf <dig>  and one mission sirna  for znf <dig>  reverse transfection of sirna was performed using lipofectaminetm  <dig>  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sirna transfections were carried at as described in  <cit> .

affymetrix microarray gene expression analysis
hmsc-tert cells were cultured and induced to differentiate into osteoblasts as described  <cit> . at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 days after induction, total rna was extracted using trizol  as previously reported  <cit> . five hundred ng of total rna from each sample were used for biotin-labeled crna production using a linear amplification kit . first- and second-strand cdna syntheses were performed from 8 μg total rna using the superscript choice system  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. subsequent hybridization and scanning of the affymetrix arrays were performed as described previously  <cit> . the biotinylated targets were hybridized to hugene  <dig> st v  <dig> affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. expression measures were generated and normalized using the rma procedure implemented in the partek genomics suite version  <dig> . <dig>  values were then log <dig> transformed before further analysis. affymetrix hugene  <dig> st arrays were used for siznf <dig> knock down and corresponding control samples. partek genomics suite version  <dig>  was used to analyse the resultant microarray data.

illumina bead chip microarray
hmsc-tert cells were cultured and induced to differentiate into osteoblasts as described  <cit> . at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after induction, total rna was extracted from each of three independent cell cultures. at 90–100 % confluence, highly purified total cellular rna was isolated using an rneasy kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. a total of 500 ng of total rna from each sample was used for biotin-labeled crna production using a linear amplification kit .

hybridization, washing, cy3-streptavidin staining and scanning were performed on the illumina beadstation  <dig> platform  according to the manufacturer’s instruction. crna samples were hybridized onto illumina ht <dig> v <dig> beadchips. analyses of gene expression data were carried out using the genomestudio software . raw data were normalized using the quantile normalisation and then filtered for significant expression on the basis of negative control beads. a p-value of <  <dig>  was used as a cut-off for detection of significance.

differential gene expression analysis and significance testing was done using the ‘lumi’ bioconductor package  <cit> . after being checked for quality, data was transformed using the ‘variance stabilizing transform’. data was quantile normalized and probes that passed the detection p-value threshold , for at least one time point, were selected for further analysis. differentially expressed genes were identified by a 2-way anova, and benjamini-hochberg multiple testing correction.

extraction of curated transcription factors
transcription factors were extracted from illumina and affymetrix datasets using the list of  <dig> curated tfs detailed in  <cit> . this was done using partek genomics suite . some tfs on the list were updated to their current ensembl identifiers. a small number of tfs were not present on the affymetrix gene st array, and were thus excluded from the analysis.

self organising map-based cluster analysis
self organising map  cluster analysis was performed using partek genomics suite . for the illumina array dataset, the average gene expression of the three replicates at each time point was used as the gene expression measure. gene expression data was shifted to a mean of zero before cluster generation to aid in the viewing of cluster profiles. the number of clusters in each map was varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  in order to identify the optimum number of clusters for a particular dataset. the optimum number of clusters was achieved when each cluster displayed a single gene expression trend across the time course. for the affymetrix array dataset, this was  <dig> clusters and for the illumina array dataset it was  <dig> 

rna isolation and real-time quantitative pcr
total rna was isolated using trizol  as previously reported . for real-time quantitative pcr, data were normalised to the geometric mean of four reference genes  and analysed using a comparative ct method. primer sequences were designed using the primer-blast tool . primer sequences are listed below in table  <dig> table  <dig> forward and reverse primer sequences for real-time quantitative pcr assays

western blot analysis
western blot analyses were carried out on control and differentiated ob cells as previously reported  <cit> . the antibodies used were znf <dig>  and alpha-tubulin  whereas goat anti rabbit igg-hrp  was used as the secondary antibody.

blast analysis and domain alignment
evolutionary analysis of znf <dig> protein sequence was performed using the blastp program available at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi. domain alignments of znf <dig> orthologs were generated using the ‘illustrator for biological sequences’ tool   <cit> .

RESULTS
hmsc-tert differentiate into osteoblastic cells in vitro and form heterotopic bone in vivo
hmsc-tert differentiate readily into osteoblastic cells, evidenced by enhanced expression of osteoblast marker genes  , increased alkaline phosphatase activity and formation of in vitro mineralized matrix stained positive for alizarin red during differentiation . hmsc-tert cells are also able to form heterotopic bone when implanted subcutaneously, with hydroxyapatite tricalcium phosphate , in immune deficient mice .fig.  <dig> hmsc-tert differentiate into osteoblastic cells in vitro and form heterotopic bone in vivo. a rt-pcr experiments show gene expression of canonical osteoblastic markers alp, col1a <dig> and bglap in hmsc-tert cells at day  <dig> and day  <dig> post-induction of ob differentiation. the error bars  represent  <dig> independent biological replicates. the y axis represents expression relative to a set of housekeeping genes. b alkaline phosphatase  activity in hmsc-tert cells at days  <dig> and  <dig> post-ob induction. alizarin red  staining for matrix mineralisation at days  <dig> and  <dig> post-ob induction. c in vivo bone-formation assay was performed by implanting hmsc-tert, mixed with hydroxyapatite–tricalcium phosphate , subcutaneously into immune-deficient mice for 8 weeks. sections were stained with hematoxylin  and eosin   or human- specific vimentin demonstrating human origin of osteoid and osteocytes . the scale bar =100 μm




transcription factors associated with in vitro osteoblast differentiation
two microarray datasets were generated during in vitro osteoblast differentiation of hmsc-tert: illumina ht12-v <dig> arrays at four time points  and affymetrix hugene  <dig>  stv <dig> arrays at six time points . these datasets will be referred to as the ‘illumina’ and ‘affymetrix’ datasets. the illumina time course dataset was filtered to extract expression patterns for  <dig> human tfs, as curated by vaquerizas et al.  <cit> . this produced a list of  <dig> probes, mapping to  <dig> unique tfs. one hundred and forty nine tfs showed expression changes of  <dig>  > fc >  <dig>  between day  <dig> and day  <dig> post ob induction, with an adjusted p value of  <dig> . this threshold was used because runx <dig> and atf <dig>  the major regulators of osteoblastogenesis, displayed a fold change of  <dig>   and  <dig>   in the illumina dataset, respectively. for the affymetrix dataset,  <dig> tfs were extracted, using the same curated set from vaquerizas et al.  <cit> .

transcription factors cluster according to temporal expression during in vitro osteoblast differentiation
to identify groups of genes that showed similar temporal expression patterns during in vitro osteoblastic differentiation, self-organizing maps  were used . for the affymetrix tf dataset, six clusters showed distinct up or down regulation across the time-course . the up-regulated clusters i, ii and iii contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively whereas the down-regulated clusters iv, v and vi contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. interestingly, another cluster showed a decrease in gene expression from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  followed by an increase in gene expression to day  <dig>  the tfs contained within all clusters are listed in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> transcription factor expression profiles across an osteoblast differentiation time course. a transcription factor expression levels were extracted from affymetrix microarrays and clustered with self organizing maps. the y axis of each cluster cell is normalised, log <dig> gene expression, while the x axis displays the six time points in days . clusters displaying a distinct change in expression profile across time are outlined in the map and shown to the right. there are three upregulated clusters, outlined in red: i , ii  and iii . there are three downregulated clusters, outlined in blue: iv , v  and vi . the cluster , outlined in green, contains  <dig> genes and showed a decrease in expression during early differentiation, followed by an upregulation in expression from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  b transcription factor expression levels were extracted from illumina microarrays and clustered with self organizing maps. the y axis of each cluster cell is the normalised, log <dig> gene expression, while the x axis displays the four time points in days . clusters displaying a distinct change in expression profile across time are outlined. these clusters are expanded in the right hand side of the image. there are five upregulated clusters, labelled i , ii , iii , iv  and v , outlined in red. there are three downregulated clusters labelled vi , vii  and viii  and these are outlined in blue. c gene expression profiles across the ob differentiation time-course for transcription factors znf <dig>  zbtb <dig> and znf <dig>  these are extracted from the  affymetrix array data and  illumina array data. the time points in days post-ob induction are labeled on the x axis, while the y axis displays normalized gene expression values. for the affymetrix array plot , the fold change values between day  <dig> and day  <dig> are: znf <dig> , zbtb <dig>  and znf <dig> . for the illumina array plot , the fold change and p values are for day  <dig> versus day 0: znf <dig> , zbtb <dig>  and znf <dig> . the illumina array tf plot  displays an average of the  <dig> biological replicates at each time point

we examined all the clusters containing upregulated genes, for the presence of tfs that have known roles in osteoblast differentiation. cluster i contained  <dig> tfs, of which seven have been previously documented to be involved in osteoblastogenesis in mouse and rat models. these include ahr, ddit <dig>  egr <dig>  rora, sall <dig>  zeb <dig> and znf385a  <cit>  . cluster ii contained runx <dig>  along with tfs epas <dig>  hes <dig> nr4a <dig>  prdm <dig>  stat <dig> and zbtb16; these are known to either be involved in osteoblastic differentiation or bone homeostasis, as direct regulators or via an interaction with a regulator . cluster iii contained  <dig> tfs, all of which have previously been documented to be involved in hmsc differentiation into either osteoblasts, adipocytes or chondrocytes   <cit>  .

we further examined the upregulated clusters for tfs that are currently not associated with differentiation and development. this revealed a total of  <dig> tfs of interest; ten of which were in cluster i. the majority of these are zinc finger proteins  and two are zinc finger and btb domain-containing proteins, zbtb <dig> and zbtb <dig>  the final tf was in cluster ii, which was zinc finger protein znf <dig> 

the illumina tf dataset was also subjected to the same process of som clustering as described for the affymetrix dataset. in this case, this produced  <dig> clusters of tf expression profiles. each cluster contained between  <dig> and  <dig> genes. five clusters showed up-regulation of tfs across the time-course , while three clusters showed a distinct down-regulation . the tf content and gene expression information of each labeled cluster is detailed in table  <dig>  the total of  <dig> tfs in clusters i to v were examined to identify which tfs have previously been implicated in msc differentiation, bone formation or related mesodermal differentiation processes such as adipogenesis. fifty nine of the tfs were found to be differentiation-associated, whereas  <dig> tfs were identified as potentially novel osteoblast-differentiation associated tf candidates. these included znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig>  along with two zinc finger- and btb-domain containing proteins zbtb <dig> and zbtb <dig> and zz-type zinc finger-containing protein zzz <dig>

identification of three novel tfs associated with in vitro osteoblast differentiation
we employed a number of criteria to select tfs for further analysis. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the tfs had to be present in up-regulated som clusters in both affymetrix and illumina analyses, the tfs had to be previously unreported in association with hmsc differentiation, bone formation or related processes and, finally, the tfs had to exhibit a statistically significant increase in expression during in vitro ob differentiation. three tfs satisfied these criteria, namely zinc finger protein  <dig> , zinc finger- and btb-domain containing protein  <dig>  and zinc finger protein  <dig> . the fold change increase in gene expression and p-values showed by these during differentiation for day  <dig> versus day  <dig> were znf <dig> , zbtb <dig>  and znf <dig>  in the illumina dataset . we further validated gene expression profiles of znf <dig>  znf <dig> and zbtb <dig>  employing quantitative rt-pcr in independent biological experiments . similar to the microarray data, all three tfs displayed a temporal increase in gene expression with maximal expression during the late phase  of in vitro osteoblast differentiation . there was also a statistically significant difference in qpcr expression measurements between day  <dig> and day  <dig> for znf <dig> and znf <dig>  however, zbtb <dig> did not display a significant difference. .fig.  <dig> the method used to identify znf <dig>  znf <dig> and zbtb as candidates of interest in osteogenesis. the gene expression profiles for a number of transcription factors were extracted from two microarray datasets , using a curated set of human transcription factors . self organising maps  were then used to cluster the subsets of tfs according to temporal expression pattern. tfs that were upregulated in som clusters were then further screened based on literature analysis. upregulated tfs that were previously unreported to be associated with hmsc differentiation, bone formation or related processes were selected for further analysis. in addition, the tf expression profiles extracted from the illumina array dataset were analysed for differential expression. tfs that were significantly differentially expressed between undifferentiated hmsc and differentiated ob were selected for further analysis. three tfs satisfied all of these selection criteria, namely znf <dig>  zbtb <dig> and znf608



fig.  <dig> validation of expression increases for znf <dig>  zbtb <dig> and znf <dig> during ob differentiation in hmsc-tert cells. a-c quantitative rt-pcr showing expression of znf <dig>  zbtb <dig> and znf <dig> in hmsc-tert cells during ob differentiation. the y axis represents mean expression relative to a set of housekeeping genes . the x axis represents days post-induction of ob differentiation. error bars reflect sem from  <dig> biological replicates. d alkaline phosphatase activity in hmsc-tert cells after sirna knockdown of tfs znf <dig>  zbtb <dig> and znf <dig>  the alkaline phosphatase activity was measured at day  <dig> post-ob induction for all samples, where the y axis reflects units of p-nitrophenylphosphate normalised to cell number. the ni sicontrol refers to hmsc-tert cells not induced for ob differentiation and transfected with a scrambled control sirna. the ob sicontrol refers to hmsc-tert cells induced for ob differentiation and transfected with a scrambled control sirna. a highly significant reduction in alp activity was observed between siznf <dig> and ob sicontrol  and a highly significant increase in alp activity was observed between siznf <dig> and the ob sicontrol ; these are marked by four asterisks. there was no significant change in alkaline phosphatase activity between sizbtb <dig> and ob sicontrol




sirna knock-down of znf <dig> affects osteoblast differentiation
the temporal gene expression pattern of the candidate tfs suggested a role in osteoblast differentiation of hmsc. to test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of sirna-mediated knockdown of each of the tfs on alp activity, as a marker of the osteoblastic phenotype. a statistically significant decrease in alp activity was seen on knockdown of znf <dig> , relative to that of the scrambled sirna control. by contrast, sirna-mediated knockdown of znf <dig> and zbtb <dig> did not show a reduction on alp activity. on the other hand, knockdown of znf <dig> actually showed a statistically significant increase  in alp activity. for the purposes of this study we further focused our analyses only on znf <dig> 

znf <dig> protein expression increases during osteoblast differentiation

znf <dig> sirna knockdown causes increase in expression of genes relevant to osteoblast differentiation
znf <dig> contains a krab domain, and is therefore likely to act as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . to gain insight into the possible targets of znf <dig> and confirm its repressor activity, we used microarrays to analyse the gene expression of control and znf <dig> knockdown cells  at days  <dig> and day  <dig>  post-osteoblast differentiation . at day  <dig>   <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed between siznf <dig> and control samples . at day  <dig>  by contrast,  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed between siznf <dig> and control samples . since znf <dig> contains a krab domain and is likely to be a transcriptional repressor, any genes that show marked upregulation could be of functional significance. at day  <dig>  there were no genes that showed dramatic upregulation in siznf <dig> cells. however at day  <dig> there were four genes that showed 18-fold to 26-fold upregulation. the most significantly upregulated gene in differentiated siznf <dig> cells relative to control was matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> . the next most upregulated genes were leucine-rich repeat containing g protein-coupled receptor  <dig>  and ran binding protein 3-like . we also observed a very high upregulation in unannotated transcript cluster,  <dig> . on further investigation it was found that this transcript cluster maps to chromosomal location: chr7:94058513– <dig>  this chromosomal location corresponds to exon  <dig> of the col1a <dig> gene, however no other probes for this gene were upregulated to this level.fig.  <dig> znf <dig> sirna knockdown increases the expression of mmp <dig>  lgr <dig>  ranbp3l and other osteoblastic differentiation genes. volcano plot representing the  <dig> genes most differentially expressed between siznf <dig> knockdown and control hmscs at day  <dig> post-ob induction. the siznf25/control fold change for each gene is represented on the x axis, with the corresponding p value represented on the y axis ). genes which have the gene ontology  annotation ‘extracellular matrix organisation’ are coloured in red. genes with go annotation ‘skeletal system development’ are coloured in green and those with go annotation ‘regulation of ossification’ are coloured in blue. genes in these three categories are listed on the right. this figure represents ‘extracellular matrix organisation’, ‘skeletal system development’ and ‘regulation of ossification’ annotation categories only, as genes with the annotations ‘ossification’ and ‘bone development’ are all contained within the other  <dig> categories. there were four very highly upregulated genes . these are matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> , leucine-rich repeat containing g protein-coupled receptor  <dig> , ran binding protein 3-like  and unannotated transcript cluster,  <dig> . on further investigation it was found that this latter transcript cluster maps to chromosomal location: chr7:94058513– <dig>  which corresponds to exon  <dig> of the col1a <dig> gene. lgr <dig> and ranbp3l have very similar expression values and so the dots on the volcano plot for each gene are overlapping




david functional enrichment analysis  <cit>  of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed at day  <dig> post-ob induction showed enrichment for: ‘extracellular matrix organisation’ , ‘ossification’ , ‘bone development’ , ‘skeletal system development’  and ‘regulation of ossification’ . the genes involved in these enrichment categories are all upregulated . analyses of the same gene sets by revigo  <cit>  and gorilla  <cit>  yielded functionally similar results . background used for all enrichment analyses was the affymetrix human gene  <dig>  st array gene set.

znf <dig> is conserved but found only in tetrapod vertebrates
the evolutionary conservation of znf <dig> was then investigated. znf <dig> was highly conserved amongst mammals, with the top  <dig> top-ranked proteins from blast analysis being from mammalian species. the mouse protein zfp <dig>  for example, showed 79 % sequence identity with an e value =  <dig>  and appeared as a true ortholog of znf <dig> via a reciprocal blast with all human proteins. use of the gablam tool  <cit>  also identified znf <dig> mammalian homologs in seven species. these observations are consistent with results in the ncbi homologene database, that details znf <dig> orthologs for mammalian species, including pan troglodytes, macaca mulatta, canis lupus, bos taurus, mus musculus and rattus norvegicus. for other species, we observed full length matches to the chicken protein zfp <dig>  and xenopus tropicalus zinc finger protein  <dig> . however these are unlikely to be true orthologs as they did not identify znf <dig> via reciprocal blast. whilst a single krab domain was present in each protein, different numbers of c2h <dig> domains were present, with  <dig> in human but  <dig> in chicken and xenopus. in zebrafish, there was partial homology to the znf <dig> c2h <dig> domain found in gastrula zinc finger protein xicgf <dig> -like . in the fruit fly, there was also partial homology to the znf <dig> c2h <dig> domain in the crooked legs protein, isoform b . the krab domain was not present in these two proteins. these results indicate that the krab domain of znf <dig> protein is conserved in tetrapod vertebrates. figure  <dig> shows a domain alignment of znf <dig> and homologs identified by the blast analysis.fig.  <dig> domain alignment between znf <dig> and its homologs in mouse, chicken and xenopus. these are drawn approximately to scale. there were no direct orthologs discovered in zebrafish or in drosophila. however the closest matching proteins in these species, that contain multiple c2h <dig> domains, are shown. the krab domain is coloured in red and c2h <dig> domains are coloured in yellow. the length of each protein is denoted by numbers at the start and end the protein. the drosophila crooked legs protein is larger and is not drawn to the same scale




discussion
this study has shown that a novel transcription factor, znf <dig>  has a role in the differentiation of hmscs to osteoblastic cells. we observed that expression of the transcription factor znf <dig> increased steadily during ob differentiation of hmscs, and its deficiency significantly decreased alkaline phosphatase levels in differentiating osteoblastic cells. the znf <dig> protein is present in the nuclei of mature osteoblastic cells and osteocytes in human bone. these results suggest that znf <dig> plays a role in in osteoblast differentiation of hmscs.


znf <dig> belongs to the krueppel c2h2-type zinc-finger protein family and contains  <dig> c2h2-type zinc fingers and one krab domain  <cit> . the krueppel-associated box  is a domain of around  <dig> amino acids that is found in the n-terminal part of about one third of eukaryotic krueppel-type c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins . these krab-zfps make up the largest family of zinc finger transcription factors in mammals and are only found in tetrapod vertebrates  <cit> . the krab-zfp family has expanded greatly to include hundreds of members in mammals  <cit> . the krab domain acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to corepressor proteins, whereas the c2h <dig> zinc-finger domains bind dna. the function of proteins in the krab family include repression of rna polymerase ii and iii promoters and binding and splicing of rna  <cit> .

krab-zinc finger proteins are known to play important roles during cell differentiation and development. individual members of one subfamily of krab zinc finger genes  are restricted to specific hematopoietic cell lineages and may play a role in lineage commitment, possibly silencing transcription from nonlineage-expressed genes  <cit> . one of the other krab zinc finger proteins is involved in osteoblast differentiation. aj <dig>  was identified by jhoen et al. as a repressor of osteoblast differentiation in rat embryonic tibia and calvariae  <cit> . overexpression of aj <dig> suppressed runx <dig> activity and repressed the markers of osteoblast differentiation alp and, bglap. our blast analysis confirmed the krab domain is only found in tetrapod vertebrates. previous studies have reported that krab-zfps have expanded to a large degree in mammals  <cit> .

the temporal expression profile of znf <dig> clustered with profiles of other transcription factors known to be involved in osteogenesis. these transcription factors include smad <dig>  fos, and snai <dig>  smad <dig> functions synergistically with smad <dig> and runx <dig> to induce osteoblast-specific gene expression in c2c <dig> cells  <cit> . fos proteins heterodimerize with jun proteins to form the ap <dig> transcription factor complex, which is an important regulator of bone formation  <cit> . snai <dig> binds to runx <dig> promoters in vivo and acts as a positive transcriptional regulator in human osteoblasts  <cit> . whilst the profile of znf <dig> expression does not allow us to understand its exact timing in any transcription factor cascade, its co-expression with the transcription factors, above, emphasizes its association with ostoegenesis.

to discover putative genes that are targets of znf <dig>  and thus suggest possible molecular mechanisms by which znf <dig> affects osteoblast differentiation, we identified the genes that are differentially regulated following sirna-mediated knock down. given that znf <dig> has a krab domain, and is likely to be a transcriptional repressor, we anticipated the upregulation of a number of osteogenic genes. mmp <dig>  ranbp3l and lgr <dig> showed striking upregulation and are functionally related to osteoblast differentiation.

mmp <dig> was initially described as a collagenase to degrade fibrillary collagen   <cit>  and other extracellular matrix proteins: fibronectin, aggrecan, laminin, perlecan, and vitronectin  <cit> . mmp <dig> has also non-extracellular matrix substrates . degradation of these substrates, such as col1a <dig>  by increased mmp <dig> may lead to impaired extracelluar matrix levels and/or organization. since ecm abundance, structure and/or content may be important triggers for mineralization, this may explain the apparent impairment of in vitro formation of mineralized matrix. ranbp3l has recently  <cit>  been reported to be a nuclear export factor for smad1/5/ <dig>  which are effectors of canonical bmp signaling. canonical bmp signalling is tightly regulated through reversible phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of smad1/ <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, chen et al.  <cit>  showed that overexpression of ranbp3l blocks bmp-induced osteogenesis of mouse bm-mscs, while depletion of ranbp3l expression enhances bmp-dependent msc differentiation activity and transcriptional responses. further to this, the overexpression of ranbp3l in bm-mscs was shown to result in reduced alp activity and alizarin red staining, a phenotype which is consistent to what we observed on knockdown of znf <dig> and its resulting increase in ranbp3l expression. however, chen et al.  <cit>  reported that ranbp3l overexpression compromised the bmp-induced expression of the preosteoblast marker runx <dig>  whereas we did not detect any changes in expression of runx <dig>  thus it is likely that ranbp3l acts earlier in the differentiation process than znf <dig>  lgr <dig> is an orphan g-protein coupled receptor and is a direct target of canonical wnt signaling. lgr <dig> potentiates the canonical wnt signaling pathway by binding to r-spondins  <cit> . lgr <dig> also a mouse marker of stem cells in small intestine and colon  <cit> . its relationship to osteoblast differentiation is currently unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that the uncharacterized transcription factor, znf <dig>  has a role in the differentiation of hmscs to osteoblasts. znf <dig> appears to act as a transcriptional repressor via a krab domain and we identified three potential targets of znf <dig>  matrix metallopeptidase  <dig>  leucine-rich repeat containing g protein-coupled receptor  <dig> and ran-binding protein 3-like. future studies will determine the role of this transcription factor in the in vivo bone formation.
