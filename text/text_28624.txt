BACKGROUND
while many of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic vesicle cycle are becoming understood, the methods by which vesicles move within the nerve terminal are less well known. even though vesicle movement is an underlying assumption of most models of synaptic vesicle trafficking, it has only been demonstrated recently that the pool of vesicles is dynamic  <cit> . understanding the mechanisms by which vesicles move within nerve terminals will inform our knowledge of both the exo- and endocytic branches of the vesicle cycle.

two modes of transport can be envisioned: diffusion and active transport. some studies, such as an analysis of vesicles in the recycling pool, are consistent with the notion that simple diffusion is a contributing force  <cit> . however, several studies indicate that a myosin-based active transport mechanism may be important  <cit> , although there are some results to the contrary  <cit> . members of the myosin-family of motor proteins share the feature of converting energy derived from atp into molecular motion and they are used in a host of cellular processes including cell motility, cytokinesis, intracellular transport and muscle contraction.

within the myosin superfamily of proteins, myosin vi shares the well-conserved basic structure of other myosin proteins, however, it is the only myosin known to move towards the pointed  ends of actin filaments. myosin vi contains a unique insert present between the converter and the iq motif of the motor domain that repositions its lever arm resulting in reverse directionality  <cit> . additionally, another unique insert near the nucleotide-binding pocket of the motor domain regulates myosin vi kinetics by restricting the accessibility of atp to the nucleotide-binding pocket, which slows adp release and hence, slows the dissociation of myosin vi from actin  <cit> . the slow kinetic properties of myosin vi suggest that it may function as an anchor that can link components to the actin cytoskeleton, in addition to functioning as a cargo transporter  <cit> . myosin vi has been specifically implicated in a number of diverse cellular roles including stereocilia maintenance  <cit> , spermatid individualization  <cit> , border cell migration  <cit> , nuclear transcription  <cit> , epithelial cell-cell contacts  <cit> , and regulating golgi morphology and exocytosis  <cit> . in addition, myosin vi is thought to have a function in the vesicle cycle in clathrin-mediated endocytosis since some splice variants of myosin vi in human and mammalian tissues localize to clathrin-coated pits/vesicles  <cit> . in mammalian cells, myosin vi has been shown to associate with endocytic vesicles following clathrin uncoating and to subsequently transport these uncoated vesicles through the actin-rich periphery to the early endosome  <cit> . cells of myosin vi knock-out mice exhibit defects in clathrin-coated vesicle formation and internalization  <cit> . the mechanism of myosin vi transport in endocytosis has yet to be fully resolved as both monomers and dimers of myosin vi have been observed to move processively upon cargo binding  <cit> .

although myosin vi has received intense attention as a result of its unique directionality and its ability to perform distinct functions as a cargo transporter and anchor in the cell, relatively little is known regarding the role of myosin vi in the nervous system  <cit> . myosin vi mutant mice exhibit a decrease in the number of synapses, a decrease in dendritic spine length and an increase in the number of astrocytes as well as impaired synaptic transmission  <cit> . in drosophila, myosin vi has been shown to contribute to the asymmetric division of neural progenitor cells during embryonic nervous system development  <cit> .

additionally, a genetic study from our lab identified a potential role for myosin vi as a modifier of nmj development  <cit> . we were therefore interested in understanding the role of myosin vi at this model synapse and asked how loss of jar affects synaptic function and development. we first observed a significant locomotor defect in severe jar loss of function mutants, and then we used microscopy and electrophysiology to further characterize the role of myosin vi at the nmj. we show novel roles for myosin vi in maintaining proper synaptic vesicle localization to the bouton periphery and in regulating synaptic transmission.

RESULTS
myosin vi protein expression levels in jar loss of function mutants
the jar alleles used here have been previously characterized  <cit> ; we quantified the myosin vi protein levels by western blot of third instar larval brains and body walls, excluding the mouth parts. the resulting blot revealed reduced myosin vi levels in all jar loss of function mutants tested , with virtually no myosin vi found in the most severe jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> zygotic and maternal null allelic combination. when the band density was measured for myosin vi staining and normalized to the intensity of the loading control, β-tubulin, a reduction in myosin vi levels was also observed in two different heterozygote combinations, jar322/+ and dfcrb87-5/+, as compared to the control in blots of both brain and body wall samples, although this is less obvious on the blot. these data are representative of three separate trials of this experiment and serve to confirm the myosin vi alleles used for this study were loss of function, consistent with previous descriptions of these alleles  <cit> .

myosin vi mutants exhibit general locomotor defects
myosin vi mutant larvae were observed to be sluggish compared to their wild-type counterparts. to characterize any locomotor defects present in jar mutant larvae, larval path length testing was performed on the most severe jar mutant, jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> mn, and a control strain. larval path length measured over  <dig> minutes was significantly shorter on both a nutritive and non-nutritive substance for jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> mn larvae  compared to the control  . since the path lengths were shorter on both nutritive and non-nutritive substrates, these results indicate that the jar mutant exhibits general locomotor dysfunction as opposed to a foraging defect, wherein path length would be expected to differ from the control only on a nutritive substrate  <cit> .

myosin vi contributes to proper synaptic morphology
although myosin vi is known to be important for drosophila embryonic nervous system development  <cit> , a function for myosin vi at the nmj has yet to be described and the locomotor defects observed in the jar maternal nulls mutant may reflect problems at this synapse. nmj morphology was visualized in jar loss of function mutants by staining neuronal tissues with an fitc-conjugated anti-hrp antibody. third instar larval nmjs on ventral longitudinal muscles  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited a significant decrease in nmj length for all of the jar loss of function mutants studied compared to the control . the shortest mean nmj length was observed for jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> larvae,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm , compared to the control,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . in addition, a significant decrease in ib bouton number was observed for jar loss of function mutants at muscle 6/ <dig> nmjs  . on control nmjs from muscle 6/ <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  boutons  were observed; whereas these synapses in jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> larvae had a mean number of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  boutons .

to further investigate the role of myosin vi in regulating synaptic morphology, staining of the integral vesicle membrane protein synaptotagmin i was used to visualize synaptic vesicle localization in the boutons of control and jar loss of function mutant larvae. ultrastructural studies have shown that vesicles are localized to the periphery of boutons, with the centre either void or partially occupied by mitochondria  <cit> ; this gives rise to a characteristic torus -shaped synaptotagmin pattern, with vesicles concentrated in an outer ring of the bouton when viewed with the light microscope  <cit> . surprisingly, visualization of synaptotagmin staining in jar mutant boutons revealed a disruption in proper vesicle localization. the majority of jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> ib boutons exhibited diffuse synaptotagmin localization across the entire bouton area, rather than the characteristic torus-pattern. the differences in synaptotagmin distribution are illustrated by representative control and mutant jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> boutons, shown with their corresponding plot profiles .

to quantify these observed differences in synaptotagmin localization we calculated the relative difference in fluorescence intensity across a bouton's plot profile . relative difference in fluorescence intensity was significantly lower across jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> mutant boutons compared to control boutons  . however, there was no significant difference in mean fluorescence intensity over total bouton area for both genotypes  . interestingly, diffuse jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> boutons were found to be significantly larger than control boutons and jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> boutons with a normal, torus-shaped distribution of synaptotagmin  .

to quantify the population of boutons displaying abnormal synaptotagmin distribution, ib boutons were scored as normal or diffuse for control and jar mutant muscle 6/ <dig> nmjs in third instar larvae. this protocol revealed an increase in the percentage of diffuse ib boutons for jar mutant nmjs compared to control nmjs . a chi square goodness of fit test revealed that all jar mutants significantly differed from the control in number of normal and diffuse ib boutons . taken together these data indicate that myosin vi contributes to proper synaptic development. specifically, the unexpected diffuse synaptotagmin staining over the ib bouton centre observed in jar mutants suggests that myosin vi plays a role in maintaining normal peripheral vesicle localization.

myosin vi plays a role in basal synaptic transmission
as the localization of synaptic vesicles is known to be important in basal synaptic function  <cit> , the vesicle mislocalization phenotype observed at jar mutant synapses may be associated with impaired synaptic transmission. to characterize synaptic physiology at jar mutant synapses, synaptic transmission was assessed by measuring nerve-evoked and spontaneous transmitter release at larval nmjs. low frequency stimulation allows us to assess the state of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, whereas higher frequency stimulation allows us to probe the recruitment of vesicles from the reserve pool. the ability of the neuron to maintain transmission under sustained high frequency stimulation also allows us to measure the endocytotic ability of the synapse.

low frequency nerve-evoked responses were collected at  <dig> hz stimulation and the mean ejp amplitude was calculated from  <dig> stimuli per nmj. jar mutants lacking a maternal contribution of myosin vi, jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> mn, exhibited a significantly lower mean ejp amplitude  than the control  .

recordings of spontaneous vesicle release, collected for  <dig> to  <dig> minutes, were used to calculate mejp amplitude and frequency. a reduction in mejp frequency was observed in the more severe jar loss of function mutants, jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> and jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> mn , compared to the control  . average mejp amplitude was found to be approximately  <dig> mv for all genotypes studied, with no significant differences between them  .

myosin vi affects short-term synaptic plasticity
to further characterize synaptic function at jar mutant synapses, a high frequency stimulation protocol was used to examine changes in synaptic plasticity. the high frequency stimulation protocol was  <dig> ejps at  <dig> hz, followed by  <dig> hz stimulation for  <dig> minutes, concluding with  <dig>  hz stimulation for  <dig> minutes. in  <dig> mm extracellular ca2+ hl3-saline, the typical pattern of synaptic response to  <dig> hz stimulation began with rapid depression of ejp amplitude, likely due to the depletion of the readily releasable pool   <cit> . this was followed by an increase in ejp amplitude, corresponding to mobilization of the reserve pool  due to the presence of residual ca2+ in the neuronal cytoplasm  <cit> , and a subsequent steady decline with continuing high frequency stimulation. for analysis, ejp amplitudes were normalized to the average of the first  <dig> ejps collected at  <dig> hz for each recording. no significant differences in depression at the onset of high frequency stimulation were observed between the genotypes  . the enhancement in ejp amplitude following the initial depression was significantly greater for jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> larvae than the control larvae  . there were no significant differences in maximum ejp amplitude for the jar loss of function heterozygotes relative to the control.

following high frequency stimulation, post-tetanic potentiation  is observed as an enhancement of ejp for a short period of time. ptp is presynaptic in origin, caused by an increase in neurotransmitter quanta release, which is attributed to calcium release from intracellular stores that was accumulated during high frequency stimulation  <cit> . no significant difference was found in the extent of ptp at  <dig>  hz for the genotypes studied  . in addition, there was no significant difference in the amplitude of the last ejp measured at  <dig>  hz stimulation between genotypes  .

to further challenge the synapse, the same high frequency stimulation protocol was carried out in  <dig> mm  ca2+ saline. this produced a rapid depression in ejp amplitude at the onset of  <dig> hz simulation, likely due to vesicle depletion in response to high calcium concentrations  <cit> . the initial depression was followed by a slight recovery and then a continuing decline in ejp amplitude for the remainder of the  <dig> hz stimulation. the initial depression in ejp amplitude measured relative to ejp amplitude at the onset of high frequency stimulation was significantly greater for jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> larvae than the control larvae  . there were no significant differences in initial depression among the other genotypes tested . recovery of ejp amplitude at  <dig> hz stimulation was quantified as a percent increase from the lowest ejp amplitude during the initial depression to the largest ejp amplitude observed during the recovery period. there was no difference in recovery among control and jar loss of function larvae following  <dig> hz stimulation . additionally, no difference in recovery of ejp amplitude was found among genotypes at  <dig>  hz stimulation 

discussion
this work has demonstrated a novel role for myosin vi in proper synaptic development, vesicle localization, and synaptic transmission at the drosophila nmj. severe jar loss of function mutants exhibited significant defects in larval locomotor behavior prompting our investigations of myosin vi at the nmj. imaging of synaptic morphology revealed that myosin vi is important for nmj development: a reduction in nmj length and a decrease in bouton number were observed at jar loss of function mutant nerve terminals.

although myosin vi function in the vesicle cycle has been implicated in mammalian cells, this report provides the first evidence that myosin vi is important for maintaining normal peripheral vesicle localization at the bouton  <cit> . in drosophila, there are four types of boutons, which are the sites of neurotransmitter release at the nmj, and they differ in their morphological and chemical properties  <cit> . of interest for this study were the largest synaptic boutons found at type i axon terminals, which are present at all nmjs of mature larvae  <cit> . visualization of synaptotagmin staining using confocal imaging revealed a mislocalization of synaptic vesicles in jar mutant boutons. an increasing number of jar mutant boutons, corresponding to the severity of myosin vi loss of function, were found to exhibit diffuse staining over the entire bouton area as opposed to the doughnut-shaped staining pattern present in control boutons. bouton centre occupancy has previously been observed at drosophila nmjs of larvae lacking synapsin, a phosphoprotein that reversibly associates with vesicles, using fm1- <dig> loading under low frequencies  <cit> . em analysis confirmed that in synapsin knockouts there was a spread of vesicles into the bouton centre, accompanied by a reduction in the size of the reserve pool  <cit> . thus, synapsin is thought to function in maintaining the peripheral distribution of vesicles in ib boutons  <cit> . likewise, the unexpected diffuse synaptotagmin staining of jar mutant boutons suggests myosin vi participates in restricting vesicles to the bouton periphery. it is possible that myosin vi is functioning as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton at the synapse. mutant studies have revealed that the presynaptic actin cytoskeleton is required for proper synaptic morphogenesis  <cit> . myosin vi has already been shown to function in regulating the actin cytoskeleton during the process of spermatid individualization, by acting either as a structural cross-linker or as an anchor at the front edge of the actin cone, and during nuclear divisions in the syncytial blastoderm  <cit> . however, live imaging of actin dynamics at the synaptic boutons revealed no major defects in the actin cytoskeleton at jar loss of function mutant nerve terminals.

to assess whether the morphological defects in vesicle localization observed at jar mutant synapses impact synaptic transmission, electrophysiological assays with different stimulation paradigms were used to recruit vesicles from different functional pools. our data add to the knowledge of this protein's physiological role at synapses. myosin vi mutant mouse hippocampal neurons exhibit defects in the internalization of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid-type glutamate receptor, responsible for fast glutamatergic transmission, suggesting myosin vi normally plays a role in ampar endocytosis  <cit> . in addition, basal synaptic transmission is reduced in myosin vi deficient mouse hippocampal slices compared to wild-type controls  <cit> . electrophysiological experiments also indicate that myosin vi mediates glutamate release induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is known to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous system  <cit> .

our study is the first to show that myosin vi's role in synaptic transmission involves mobilization of vesicles from different functional pools, indicating that myosin vi is important for synaptic plasticity. at the drosophila nmj, three pools of vesicles with differential release properties have been identified using fm1- <dig> staining loaded by various stimulation protocols . the immediately releasable pool , representing approximately 1% of all vesicles at the nmj, consists of vesicles docked and primed at active zones for immediate release and experiences rapid depletion within a few stimuli  <cit> . the readily releasable pool , making up  <dig> to 19% of all vesicles at the nmj, is mobilized by moderate stimulation of ≤ <dig> hz and maintains exo/endocytosis at these stimulation frequencies  <cit> . the reserve pool  represents the vast majority of vesicles,  <dig> to 90%, and is mobilized upon depletion of the rrp  <cit> . recruitment from the rp occurs with high frequency stimulation of ≥ <dig> hz  <cit> . spontaneous release was reduced in the most severe jar loss of function mutants. evoked response at  <dig> hz stimulation was also reduced in the jar maternal null mutant. although less severe jar mutants exhibited a significant decrease in bouton number, they did not experience an accompanying reduction in evoked potential amplitude at low frequency stimulation, suggesting that other homeostatic mechanisms are important for maintaining synaptic strength  <cit> . the impaired synaptic response in the jar maternal null mutant may be due to a reduction in the probability of rrp vesicle release or in rrp size. if myosin vi functions to anchor synaptic vesicles, it may act on the rrp to ensure vesicles are localized in manner that makes them readily available for release. thus, in jar maternal null mutants the reduction in ejp amplitude may occur because a significant number of vesicles were displaced from areas of higher probability release. alternately, rrp pool size may be reduced at jar mutant synapses.

different synaptic vesicle pool properties, such as rate of recruitment of the rp in response to high frequency stimuli, may translate to changes in short-term synaptic plasticity  <cit> . the increase in ejp amplitude observed at  <dig> hz stimulation in  <dig> mm ca2+ saline may be attributable to enhanced mobilization of the rp for jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> nmjs  <cit> . filamentous actin has been implicated in rp mobilization as cytochalasin d, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, has been shown to reduce rp dynamics  <cit> . this suggests translocation from the rp to the rrp may be mediated by an actin-based myosin motor protein. if myosin vi functions as a synaptic vesicle tether to regulate recruitment from the rp pool, rp vesicles would be more readily mobilized and transitioned into the rrp upon high frequency stimulation in jar loss of function mutants. consistent with the idea that rp vesicles were more rapidly incorporated into the rrp, a greater initial depression is observed at jar322/dfcrb87- <dig> mutant synapses during high frequency stimulation in  <dig> mm ca2+ saline corresponding to the depletion of vesicles at high calcium concentrations. taken together, the data suggest that myosin vi mediates synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity by regulating the mobilization of synaptic vesicles from different functional pools. in mammalian cells, myosin vi has been implicated as a mediator of vesicle endocyctosis and has been shown to transport uncoated vesicles through the actin-rich periphery to the early endosome  <cit> . our experiments, however, indicate that endocytosis is not likely affected at jar mutant synapses. typically, endocytotic mutants are unable to maintain synaptic transmission in response to high frequency stimulation  <cit> , whereas our myosin vi loss of function mutants exhibited enhanced ejp amplitude observed at  <dig> hz stimulation in  <dig> mm ca2+ saline. additional experiments are required to confirm that myosin vi is functioning as a vesicle tether. fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis can be used to examine the effect of myosin vi on synaptic vesicle mobility. if myosin vi is functioning as a vesicle tether, synaptic vesicle mobility is expected to be increased in jar mutants compared to controls.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present work shows that myosin vi is important for proper synaptic morphology and physiology at the drosophila nmj. myosin vi function in peripheral vesicle localization at the bouton may underlie its contribution to basal synaptic transmission and expression of synaptic plasticity. future work will address the mechanism by which myosin vi performs its roles at the synapse, whether as a vesicle tether or by some other involvement in vesicle trafficking.
