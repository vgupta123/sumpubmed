BACKGROUND
lactation is a time of a four- to five-fold increased energy demand imposed by the suckling young that requires a proportional adjustment in the ability of the lactating dam to absorb nutrients and to synthesize critical biomolecules to meet the dietary needs of both the offspring and the dam  <cit> . lactating rats have a two- to three-fold increase in food consumption   <cit> , in part through the decreased suppression of appetite accompanying decreased serum leptin  <cit> .

diet and hyperphagia have been shown to influence the rate of cholesterol synthesis, which is increased in the liver and small intestine in the lactating rat  <cit> . of these tissues, the liver is the primary contributor to serum levels of cholesterol, and shows a quantitatively greater increase in the rate of cholesterol synthesis during lactation  <cit> . 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase , the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, shows significantly increased activity in the liver during lactation compared to virgin and nonlactating control rats  <cit> . cholesterol synthetic and lipogenic genes are regulated by transcription factors termed sterol regulatory element binding proteins ; the activity of srebp proteins is in turn regulated by the srebf chaperone  and the insulin induced genes .

circulating serum levels of several hormones that regulate metabolism are decreased during lactation in the rat, including thyroid hormone, insulin and leptin  <cit> . such changes in hormone signaling and diet are likely to have large influences on the activation of their corresponding pathways. receptors for leptin, thyroid hormone, and insulin are expressed in both the liver and small intestine  <cit> , with liver being considered a major site of insulin signaling  <cit>  and thyroid receptor Î²  being the dominant form of the thyroid receptor in both tissues  <cit> . leptin acts on the small intestine and inhibits sugar uptake  <cit> , and the liver is a major source of the soluble form of the leptin receptor, particularly under conditions of negative energy balance  <cit> , as occurs in lactation  <cit> . therefore, altered serum levels of these hormones would be expected to influence mrna expression of downstream genes.

our laboratory has been investigating the effects of lactation on the synthesis and transport of bile acids in the liver and small intestine in the rat  <cit> . bile acids are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol, and are essential for the biliary excretion of cholesterol and for the efficient intestinal absorption of cholesterol, lipid-soluble vitamins and lipids  <cit> . bile acids are secreted into bile by the bile salt export pump , taken up across the apical membrane of the enterocyte in the terminal ileum by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter , effluxed into portal blood by the organic solute transporter heterodimer , and then taken up in the hepatocyte by the sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide   <cit> . expression of ntcp, bsep and asbt are all increased in lactation  <cit> , as is the size of the bile acid pool  <cit> . we recently demonstrated that expression and activity of cyp7a <dig>  the enzyme catalyzing the rate limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, is increased at mid-lactation   <cit> . further, this increase occurs at  <dig> h  and represents a shift in the diurnal rhythm of cyp7a <dig> expression, which is normally maximal in the dark cycle . increased expression of cyp7a <dig> is apparently due to decreased expression of fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  in the ileum, resulting in decreased fgf <dig> signaling via fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  and erk1/ <dig> in liver and decreased repression of cyp7a <dig> transcription  <cit> .

in order to identify further changes in expression of genes important in the regulation of bile acid and cholesterol synthesis, as well as other genes important in meeting nutritional demands and physiological changes of the lactating rat, we carried out a microarray experiment in the liver and small intestine of the lactating dam at  <dig> h on days  <dig> - <dig> postpartum and compared these to gene expression in female virgin control rats.

RESULTS
detection of differentially expressed genes
a repeated measures mixed model anova was used to test for effects of tissue and lactation, as described in methods. a statistically significant difference was determined to exist when the physiologic state effect  yielded a p <  <dig>  and the effect of lactation within a given tissue  yielded a p <  <dig> . analyzed data are available in additional file 1: statistical_analysis_and_statistical_pattern_matching_results.txt. these p-values were used as cutoffs for differentially expressed genes and led to the proportions of false positives that are listed in the section titled "approximation of false discoveries" below.

a number  of genes demonstrated an interaction at p <  <dig>  and  <dig> genes passed a benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate correction at fdr =  <dig>  . these genes represent those that displayed a different response to lactation in one tissue with respect to the other tissues. however, it should be noted that this list was not a useful cutoff, as genes that responded uniformly to lactation across all tissues would be ignored. also, five genes that passed the benjamini-hochberg correction did not show any significant changes at p <  <dig>  when the effect of lactation was tested within each tissue. since the primary purpose of this study was to characterize the influence of lactation on gene expression on these tissues, the interaction term was not used. the tissue effect p-values indicated that many  genes were differentially expressed across tissues, due to the large difference in cell types between the liver and the small intestine. therefore, we chose the cutoffs of a physiologic state main effect at p <  <dig>  and the effect of lactation within at least one tissue at p <  <dig> , as described in the methods.

although not as many genes were detected as significantly differentially expressed compared to the overall tissue effect, the overall physiologic state effect and the pairwise comparisons  showed a high number of low p-values, indicating that the tissues in question responded to lactation at the level of mrna. several genes were downregulated in the duodenum only , with  <dig> genes showing over a 50% decrease. members of this group are listed as pattern "-100" in additional file  <dig>  histograms displaying the distribution of p-values are in additional file 3: histograms_of_p_values.ppt , and volcano plots displaying each tissue's response to lactation are in additional file 4: volcano_plots.doc.

approximation of false discoveries
the proportion of false positives is an approximation of the ratio of false positives in the list of genes listed as differentially expressed. an estimate of the number of false positives was calculated for all tissues using genes where p <  <dig>  for an overall physiologic state effect, and for each tissue using genes with an effect of lactation within each tissue  of p <  <dig> . thus, the proportion of false positives  was calculated as /number of genes detected below the p-value cutoff. the pfp as defined by fernando et al  <cit> , is e/e where e is the expected number of false rejections of the null hypothesis and e is the expected number of rejections of the null hypothesis. here we utilized the actual number of rejections of the null hypothesis as the expected value. of all of the genes on the chip,  <dig>  genes were found to be annotated and expressed in at least one tissue/physiologic-state combination and were used for statistical tests. of those genes,  <dig>  had an overall physiologic state p-value of less than  <dig> , yielding a pfp of  <dig> ; at an overall physiologic state p <  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were detected, yielding a pfp of  <dig> . pfps for the individual tissues at a cutoff of p <  <dig>  for the pairwise comparisons  were  <dig>  for the liver,  <dig>  for the duodenum,  <dig>  for the jejunum, and  <dig>  for the ileum. the pfps for the individual tissue calculations examined only the genes detected at a simple effect p <  <dig> , and not at the combined overall physiologic state cutoff of p <  <dig>  together with the within-tissue cutoff of p <  <dig> , as some genes passed the p <  <dig>  cutoff within a given tissue, but did not pass the initial overall physiologic state effect cutoff of p <  <dig> . the rationale for not utilizing the overall physiologic state effect together with the within tissue physiologic state effect in the calculation was that these multiple tests were utilized for the same gene. consequently, the list of genes reported at both p <  <dig>  for the physiologic state and p <  <dig>  for the comparison within a tissue was a subset of the list of genes that only show a p <  <dig>  within a tissue. the physiologic state cutoff of p <  <dig>  was chosen to protect against repeated testing for each tissue; this value was also chosen because changes that only occurred within one tissue would be difficult to detect if the overall physiologic state cutoff was made at p <  <dig> . approximations of the proportion of false positives in this range  have been reported previously  <cit> .

rt-pcr validation of microarray data
results from rt-pcr analyses agreed with the trends detected in the microarray analyses . in some cases, significance calls differed, but the directionality of the changes observed was consistent with the microarray data. possible causes for disagreement included the fact that different methods of normalization were used between rt-pcr and the microarray.

mean log2




ratios were calculated as lactating measurement divided by control measurement. rt-pcr data is reported as the ratio of normalized measurements, and microarray data is reported as the ratio of normalized, untransformed intensities. p-values were calculated using a mixed models approach as described in methods. rl, rd, rj and ril are the ratio of lactation to control in liver , duodenum , jejunum , and ileum , respectively. bdl, below detection limit

patterns
patterns were identified using statistical pattern matching  <cit>  by assigning each gene as significantly "up", "down", or "no change" detected in each tissue. the results of the statistical pattern matching showed that fifteen genes were upregulated in all four tissues, while thirty-one genes were downregulated in all four tissues. seventy-two genes were upregulated in liver only, and another ninety-nine genes were downregulated in liver only. results from analyses of each pattern using david  <cit>  are shown in additional file 5: david_output_file.txt.

of the fifteen genes upregulated in every tissue , seven were identified by david as being involved in the biosynthesis of sterols pathway, where p =  <dig>  Ã 10- <dig>  using the list of "up in all tissues" for the david analysis. one gene, transmembrane protein  <dig> , has been identified as being regulated by the srebp proteins  <cit> , and was recently suggested to aid in low density lipoprotein receptor  function  <cit> . another gene, rna  methyltransferase domain containing  <dig> , is the homolog for a trna methyl transferase that occurs in yeast  <cit> . slc39a4_predicted was upregulated in all tissues, consistent with increased zinc absorption during lactation, and is discussed further below.

transcript
to be considered part of a grouping, genes must have had a physiologic state p <  <dig>  and at least one tissue simple effect p <  <dig> . reported p-values are the tissue simple effect p-values. the tissue simple effect p-value represents the comparison between lactation and control in the corresponding tissue. for the purposes of assigning patterns, the significance cutoff for the remaining tissues' simple effect p-values was set to p <  <dig> . abbreviations used as in table  <dig>  *gene is at the extended confidence level.

thirty-one genes were identified as downregulated in all tissues . according to the over-representation analysis in david, the kegg t cell receptor pathway was over-represented in this group   <cit>  , although only three genes appeared in this list. this pathway did not pass any of the multiple testing procedures available in david, but is consistent with the ipa results, which flagged "t-cell signaling and differentiation" to be downregulated in the jejunum and ileum .

genes downregulated only in the duodenum were also investigated using david, as several genes revealed a strong downregulation in this tissue . many of these genes have been identified as being expressed in the pancreas, i.e., eight of the  <dig> genes in this group matched the sp_pir keyword "pancreas" . the function of these genes in the duodenum and the reason for their poor expression in lactation is not known.

the list of genes upregulated in all parts of the small intestine was not significantly enriched by any kegg pathways in david. the term lipid biosynthetic process was overrepresented , although this term did not pass any multiple testing correction available in david.

"the fibronectin type iii fold" interpro entry was flagged as overrepresented in the list of genes downregulated in the small intestine, but not in liver . however, the relevance of the downregulation of these genes in lactation is not known.

categories overexpressed in the list of genes upregulated in the liver only included the gene ontologies for "response to nutrient levels" and "cholesterol metabolic process". the list of genes downregulated in the liver showed the gene ontology associated with positive regulation of programmed cell death and may partially explain the increased liver size during lactation  <cit> .

bile acid biosynthesis
expression of cyp7a <dig>  the enzyme catalyzing the rate limiting step of bile acid biosynthesis, was detected to be increased  in the liver with a  <dig> -fold change. few other changes were detected in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. expression of cyp46a <dig>  ch25h, cyp27a <dig>  cyp39a <dig>  cyp7b <dig>  cyp8b <dig>  akr1d <dig>  slc27a <dig>  acox <dig>  scp <dig>  and baat  <cit>  did not show a significant change in the liver, suggesting that the increase in bile acid biosynthesis observed was triggered by the increase in cyp7a <dig> mrna  <cit> . these data are consistent with our earlier detailed characterization of mrna and protein expression of cyp7a <dig>  cyp27a <dig> and cyp8b <dig> in lactation  <cit> .

ingenuity pathways analysis
the lists of differentially expressed genes for each tissue, based on the overall physiologic state effect p-value and the respective simple effects were examined by ipa. the three overrepresented pathways with the lowest p-values in each tissue are shown in table  <dig>  and selected pathways are discussed below.

the pathways with the three lowest p-values from fisher's exact test for pathways from ipa's "canonical pathways" database for each tissue are reported here along with the corresponding p-value from a right-tailed fisher's exact test, the benjamini-hochberg  adjusted p-value, and the genes within the pathway that showed differential expression within the respective tissue . arrows in the members column indicate the direction of change in lactating animals relative to controls.

cholesterol synthesis and metabolism
"biosynthesis of steroids" had the lowest p-value among ipa's "canonical pathways" in three of the four tissues, with the jejunum being the exception. at the designated cutoff , the jejunum showed a much more modest change in the "biosynthesis of steroids" pathway . detailed visualization of the pathway revealed that the upregulated sections of the "biosynthesis of steroids" pathway corresponded with cholesterol synthesis . since cholesterol synthesis is regulated by srebp proteins, srebp-regulated genes were investigated further. to determine if an exceptionally large number of srebp-regulated genes were in the list of differentially expressed genes, a list of genes shown to be regulated by srebp by detection through microarray analysis in srebp-overexpressing and scap knockout mice was used for a right-tailed fisher's exact test  <cit>  using an online calculator . here, a p-value of < <dig>  in the tissue being tested was defined as a positive test for the purpose of determining whether a given gene was differentially expressed.

of the  <dig> genes reported to be regulated by nuclear srebp proteins  <cit> ,  <dig> were present in the data set. a fisher's exact test p-value of p <  <dig>  was calculated for each tissue, with the jejunum  having the fewest genes displaying a significant change . additional file 11: genes_regulated_by_srebp_proteins.doc lists members of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and other genes that have been shown to be differentially expressed in srebp-overexpressing mice and scap knockout mice  <cit>  and indicates the p-values for each tissue and the ratio of the background-corrected, normalized, untransformed intensities . as shown in figure  <dig>  hmgcr mrna expression was increased in three of the four tissues, with no change detected in the jejunum . mrna expression for the genes  encoding the srebp proteins were not differentially expressed, although a tendency for a change was detected in the jejunum, where the simple effect comparison p-value for srebf <dig> was  <dig> , and the overall physiologic state effect p value was  <dig> . expression of insig <dig> mrna, which is regulated by srebp activity, showed a significant increase in each part of the small intestine. in contrast, an increase in scap mrna occurred in the liver only . ldlr mrna was upregulated in the duodenum and jejunum, and tmem <dig> mrna, an srebp target  <cit> , was upregulated in all tissues; both ldlr and tmem <dig> proteins aid in ldl uptake by cells  <cit> .

cholesterol uptake
the only gene known to mediate cholesterol uptake in the gut, npc1l <dig>  <cit> , is not contained in the extended dataset for the affymetrix rat exon  <dig> st. investigation of the "full" and "all" datasets indicated that no probeset on the chip was annotated as npc1l <dig>  therefore, expression of npc1l <dig> was investigated by rt-pcr . no significant changes were detected in npc1l <dig> expression in any tissue. abcg <dig> and abcg <dig>  which function as a heterodimer to efflux cholesterol from the enterocyte into the gut lumen and from the hepatocyte into bile  <cit> , showed decreased expression in the liver  and in the ileum  .


the p <  <dig>  column indicates in which tissues a change was detected. abbreviations are as defined for table  <dig>  *gene is at the extended level of confidence.

transporters
the  transporters that showed a significant change in at least one tissue were also investigated . the abc transporters are a superfamily of membrane transporters with diverse substrates that in eukaryotes mediate the atp-dependent efflux of endogenous substrates, including bile acids and cholesterol, as well as of xenobiotics, including many drugs. the abc transporter abcb1a  was downregulated in every tissue. this protein effluxes xenobiotics across the apical domain of the hepatocyte and enterocyte and plays an important role in limiting absorption of orally administered substrates  <cit> . two members of the abcc  subfamily, abcc <dig> and abcc <dig>  were downregulated in the ileum, while abcg <dig> expression was increased in the duodenum.

solute carrier proteins  are a superfamily of proteins that transport many different molecules, including amino acids and ions . all slcs on the chip were investigated and those with a detected significant change in lactation in any tissue are shown in additional file 12: slcs.doc. for each tissue, nearly 20% of the slcs showed a change at an overall physiologic state effect of p <  <dig> , and approximately 5% were declared significant after applying a p <  <dig>  cutoff within a tissue 

slc39a <dig> is a transporter mediating the uptake of zinc in the intestine  <cit> . slc39a4_predicted was one of fifteen genes to be significantly upregulated in every tissue  . fold changes for slc39a <dig> predicted based on untransformed intensity values ranged from  <dig>  in the jejunum to  <dig>  in the liver .

thyroid signaling
a fisher's exact test using ipa detected significant overrepresentation in the tr/rxr pathway in every tissue. . thyroid hormone receptor Î±  and thyroid hormone receptor Î²  were both downregulated in the ileum and jejunum. a decrease was also seen in the liver, but the change was not significant . surprisingly few of the downstream genes of tr/rxr were downregulated in the ipa depiction of this pathway. in some cases, overlap occurred with srebp signaling, and increased signaling from srebp appeared to have overridden decreased thyroid signaling. this seems to have occurred with acetyl-coa carboxylase alpha  in the liver and ldlr in both the duodenum and jejunum  <cit> . one trb/rxr regulated gene  <cit> , kruppel like factor  <dig> , which is a transcription factor associated with intestinal proliferation, was downregulated in every tissue . klf <dig> knockout mice have shorter intestinal villi, although klf <dig> is typically considered a transcriptional repressor and can also negatively regulate growth  <cit> .

decreased mrna from t-cell receptor signaling and related pathways
mrna of genes coding for the components of t-cell receptor signaling pathway in ipa showed significant downregulation in the jejunum and ileum  . a similar pathway, the "cd <dig> receptor signaling in t helper cells" pathway was also downregulated in the jejunum, but substantial overlap between the two pathways suggested observation of the same events. these pathways are upstream of il- <dig> production  <cit> , however, the microarray detected no change in il- <dig> mrna in any tissue.

discussion
cholesterol biosynthesis
ipa and david both flagged "biosynthesis of steroids" to be overrepresented in the list of differentially expressed genes in lactation in three of the four tissues , and the list of genes upregulated in all tissues during lactation, respectively . visualization of this pathway revealed that the genes identified were components of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. statistical pattern matching as well as results from overrepresentation analyses in both david and ipa indicated that expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes was induced in all tissues examined, although to a lesser extent in the jejunum . cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic genes are known to be regulated by transcription factors known as the srebp proteins. three srebp proteins are encoded by two genes, srebf <dig> and srebf <dig>  srebf <dig> codes for srebp-1a and srebp-1c, while srebf <dig> codes for srebp- <dig>  the srebp proteins differ in their control of fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis  <cit> . srebp- <dig> is associated with cholesterol biosynthesis, while the srebp <dig> proteins are associated with fatty acid synthesis  <cit> , although there appears to be overlap in the genes that are responsive to these transcription factors  <cit> . srebp-1c is sensitive at the transcriptional level to lxr signaling  <cit> , while all three share a mechanism for becoming an active transcription factor  <cit> . under conditions of sufficient cholesterol concentrations, the protein product of insulin stimulated gene  binds to srebf chaperone  to retain an insig/scap/srebp complex in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . in the absence of oxysterols and cholesterol, insig is degraded and scap is released from the endoplasmic reticulum; scap then escorts the bound srebp to the golgi, where the n-terminus of the srebp is cleaved from the full protein to generate the active form that functions as a transcription factor  <cit> . as indicated above, cholesterol synthesis is increased during lactation in both the liver and the small intestine  <cit>  and srebp target genes have also been shown to be upregulated in mammary tissue in lactating dams  <cit> .

the observation that srebp-regulated genes were upregulated is consistent with early data showing an overall increased cholesterol biosynthesis in lactation  <cit> . we currently do not know which srebp isoforms are involved in the changes seen in lactation, as srebp-1c, srebp-1a and srebp- <dig>  are all able to regulate expression of cholesterol synthetic genes. however, srebp- <dig> plays a stronger role in regulating these genes  <cit> . the only potential change detected in the mrna for a srebf gene was srebf <dig>  the gene associated with srebp-1a and srebp-1c, which showed increased mrna levels in the jejunum.

in the liver, scap mrna showed a significant increase . if this change were associated with an increase in scap protein levels, then a probable mechanism for the increase in srebp target genes in the liver would be increased transport of srebp proteins to the golgi, and their subsequent delivery to the nucleus  <cit> . insig <dig> mrna also showed a significant increase in all parts of the small intestine, but not in the liver. insig <dig> functions to retain srebp in the endoplasmic reticulum. thus, increased expression of scap in liver and increased expression of insig <dig> in intestine provide a likely mechanism for the greater increase in cholesterol synthesis in liver vs. intestine observed by feingold et al  <cit> .

a number of factors contribute to the increased need for cholesterol in the lactating dam. the dam requires significant cholesterol for the increased synthesis of bile acids; 50% of cholesterol catabolized in the liver from nonlactating rats is used for bile acid synthesis  <cit> . since the size of bile acid pool increases 2-3-fold at  <dig> - <dig> d of lactation  <cit> , greater than 50% of cholesterol is likely catabolized to bile acids in lactation. the proportion of dietary cholesterol vs. endogenously synthesized cholesterol that is catabolized to bile acids in nonlactating vs. lactating rats is not known. most importantly, cholesterol is an essential component of milk that supports membrane synthesis and neurodevelopment in the pups  <cit> . about  <dig> mg per day of cholesterol is secreted into the milk in rats  <cit> ; between  <dig> and 40% of this cholesterol is synthesized in the mammary gland, while 11% is absorbed from the diet  <cit> . thus, cholesterol synthesized in the liver makes up about 50% of cholesterol secreted in milk  <cit> .

in addition to detecting a change in cholesterol synthesis, a possible mechanism for improved net cholesterol uptake was found. abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> show decreased levels of mrna expression in the liver and ileum. a decrease in the concentration of active abcg5/abcg <dig> heterodimer in the intestine would be expected to yield an increase in net cholesterol uptake through decreased efflux from the enterocyte into the gut lumen, while decreased hepatic expression would minimize cholesterol secretion into bile  <cit> . the decreased expression of abcg5/g <dig> mrna in the liver, together with increased expression of cholesterol synthetic genes, likely serve to enhance conservation of cholesterol to allow for sufficient transfer of cholesterol into the milk and for synthesis of bile acids. increased synthesis of bile acids would in turn serve to increase cholesterol absorption  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest a concerted mechanism for enhancing net cholesterol absorption and minimizing its elimination to ensure sufficient cholesterol for incorporation into milk and bile acid synthesis, both important factors in maintaining the health of both the dam and pups.

zinc
statistical pattern matching found that slc39a4_predicted mrna was increased  in all tissues. slc39a <dig> is a major zinc transporter associated with zinc import into the enterocyte  <cit> , and zinc absorption is up-regulated in lactation  <cit> . taken together, these data imply that the increased expression of slc39a <dig> mediates the increased zinc absorption that occurs in lactation. zinc is an essential nutrient shown to be important in bone development  <cit> , to play a role in stimulating the insulin pathway  <cit>  and in controlling t-cell activity  <cit> . zinc requirements are increased during lactation relative to pregnancy, and therefore net zinc uptake needs to be increased to maintain zinc homeostasis during lactation in humans, particularly during early lactation  <cit> . interestingly, alpha-2-macroglobulin  showed a substantial increase in mrna expression  in the liver. zinc can directly regulate a2m's ability to sequester cytokines  <cit>  by enhancing formation of a form of a2m that contains free sulfhydryl groups, which serve as binding sites for the cytokines  <cit> .

downregulation of mrna from the t-cell signaling pathway
both the jejunum and ileum showed strong downregulation at the mrna level of the proteins composing the t-cell signaling pathway in ipa. these changes may reflect a decrease in the number of actual t-cells in the small intestine of lactating rats.

xenobiotic transporters
tr/rxr pathway
ipa found members of the tr/rxr pathway to be overrepresented in the list of differentially expressed genes in each tissue. in both the ileum and jejunum, both tra and trb showed down-regulation. although lactating rats are hypothyroid  <cit>  and expressed lower levels of mrna for thyroid receptor in these tissues, not all thyroid responsive genes were down-regulated, including apoa <dig>  eno <dig>  and glut <dig>  which showed no change in any tissue. a more detailed picture of the thyroid receptor pathway can be found in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  serum thyroid hormone levels and early steps in the pathway are likely downregulated as an attempt to conserve energy  <cit> . fisher's exact test determines its p-values based on the counts of the number of genes in the list of differentially expressed genes and compares these to the total number of genes in the pathway relative to the total number of genes in the microarray. therefore, pathways that overlap are likely to be detected as overrepresented if the overlapping genes are in the list of differentially expressed genes. because some srebp regulated genes are considered to be part of the tr/rxr pathway, the p-values for overrepresentation may be low, even if thyroid signaling overall was unchanged. however, changes in the mrna levels of the thyroid receptors argue against this, since these receptors have not been shown to be srebp targets.

CONCLUSIONS
the present studies have shown an increase in the mrna of enzymes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, implying that the sterol regulatory element binding proteins are more active in the liver and small intestine in lactating vs nonlactating rats. the data are consistent with a coordinated response to the overall increased energy demands of lactation and the specific needs of the pups for cholesterol so that there is adequate cholesterol for incorporation into milk and increased synthesis of bile acids; the latter in turn function to increase the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and lipids. we also demonstrated a marked increase in the expression of a key transporter important in the uptake of the essential element, zinc. finally, we detected decreased mrna from genes associated with t-cell signaling in the jejunum and ileum.
