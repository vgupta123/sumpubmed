BACKGROUND
for the last decade, genome-wide expression analysis technologies have been rapidly evolving. with the growing number of large data sets derived from a variety of technological platforms  cross-laboratory studies are becoming more challenging. these kind of studies are greatly effected by differences in target type , target production and design, the efficiencies of target labeling and sub-optimal array production/hybridization protocols  <cit> . these effects are compounded in studies involving clinically derived tissue samples such as human tumor biopsies. efforts have been made to overcome these limitations by proposing to conform to standardize experimental conditions and procedural documentation  <cit> . recently, dobbin et al. demonstrated that by using standardized conditions and a single technological platform , a cancer-related , multi-laboratory expression profiling study was feasible  <cit> . mathematical approaches  <cit>  and sequence-based mapping between platforms  <cit>  have also been developed to reduce inter-technological differences in order to maximize cross-platform studies.

nevertheless, increasing the precision and accuracy of a given microarray study will ultimately increase the yield of meaningful biological information and thus reduce the cost of genome-based biomedical discovery. since commercial expression profiling technologies, which typically offer a higher precision compared to homemade arrays, are not only becoming more abundant but also more affordable comparative studies are useful in making a cost-efficient choice. several of these types of studies have been published  <cit> . however, due to the rapid pace of technological development, the relevance of many of the published comparisons are quickly brought into question. moreover, these studies have either offered conflicting conclusions or were biased by competing interests  <cit>  and most have not been validated with a non-microarray-based approach, such as quantitative reverse-transcriptase pcr . recent papers by bammler et al. and irizarry et al. offer a multi-laboratory comparisons of different technologies  <cit> . bammler et al. compared  <dig> technological platforms and  <dig> different laboratories, and found that standardized protocols combined with comparisons limited to biological themes greatly increased inter-laboratory and inter-platform reproducibility. irizarry et al. compared different dilutions of  <dig> cell lines analyzed at  <dig> different laboratories and  <dig> different platforms  and found that overall level of accuracy and precision of a given technological platform are greatly affected by the differences in lab performance. though useful, these studies do not offer a clear choice between current genome-wide, transcriptome technologies for studying human disease in the context of a centralized, multi-project  program.

we present here, a comparison of the precision and accuracy of the latest and most exploited commercial high-density, pan-genomic short- and long-oligonucleotide reporter technologies. we compared data derived "in-house" from a common source of rnas from  <dig> different human cell lines between affymetrix hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip™ , ge healthcare codelink™   and agilent technologies  <dig> k whole human genome arrays . this comparison was conducted for the multi-project transcriptome program "cartes d'identite des tumeurs"  launched by france's ligue contre le cancer as well as for the canceropole, ile-de-france  <cit> , france's cancer research network. the aim of these programs is to provide a standardized method for centralized, large-scale transcriptome analyses of a great diversity of tumors covering the maximal number of genes of interest for intra- and inter-cancer research projects. keeping this aim in mind, we standardized the one-color with two-color data by including a common reference sample. designs that optimize studies using two-color arrays combined with a limited number of samples  were not considered.

RESULTS
all raw data sets were generated by each respective commercial entity  from a common source of biologically different rnas . data from a pre-release version of a fourth commercial platform  was also included in and limited to the evaluation of the level of discordance between the target measurements between the  <dig> platforms. the term "available targets" hereafter refers to target measurements that were not filtered out by a given platform. different lists of targets  were used for the following different aspects of the analyses: all available target measurements were used for the comparisons of intra-platform reproducibility ; all available targets out of a common lists of  <dig>  targets  were used for all inter-platform comparisons of the accuracy of target measurement ; a sub-list of  <dig> genes were used for the comparison of microarray data and quantitative qrt-pcr data.

comparison of the precision of expression measurements
in order to compare the precision of the measurements derived from each platform we used the following three criteria:  <dig>  the percentage of targets having a 2-fold difference  of expression measurements obtained between each pair-wise combination of replicate slides;  <dig>  the distribution of inter-slide  variation measures;  <dig>  inter-slide  correlation of expression profiles analyzed for  <dig> intensity quantiles. one of the major observations from this study is that the data from all platforms were highly reproducible. we found that one-color platforms globally yielded lower variation measures compared to the two-color platform of agilent . we found the lowest number of 2-fold differences between replicate samples from the affymetrix data  and the lowest cvs from amersham. although we found higher sds measurements of the log2-ratios for one-color platforms compared to their corresponding cvs this transformation did not change the overall degree of variation relative to the two-color data obtained from agilent. as another evaluation of intra-platform precision we calculated correlation coefficients  stratified by intensity quantiles . a summary of the maximum  and minimum  correlations for a given quantile are shown in figure 1c. we found the highest maximal level of correlation for the majority of targets from the amersham data while affymetrix consistently  yielded a higher correlation for lower intensities . the number of data points per quantile were not the same for each platform , however, re-computing the correlation per quantile based on  <dig>  k evenly distributed data points per quantile did not change the results . taken altogether these results show that affymetrix data was found to have a slightly overall higher level of precision compared to the other platforms.

comparison of the accuracy of expression measurements
the evaluation of platform accuracy was based on the following criteria:  <dig>  concordance between the expression levels of commonly represented targets on each array type;  <dig>  agreement in the identification of genes discriminating the three cell lines;  <dig>  concordance of relative expression compared to data obtained from qrt-pcr for subset of  <dig> genes. the first  <dig> evaluations were based on the available targets from the  <dig>  k set. this  <dig>  k set was specifically chosen in order to reduce the confounding effects of multiplicity  relationship, see methods). this approach afforded the most straightforward study of the concordance across the different platforms and did not favor platforms with high feature-to-target and/or target-to-transcript ratios. moreover, this  <dig>  k set of targets is representative, at the array feature-intensity level, of overall target measurements for each array type. roughly 25% of the available  <dig>  k targets were attributed to each of the  <dig> intensity quantile bins for each platform . expression values above the filtering thresholds were available from all platforms for  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  k common targets.

similarity in relative expression levels
cluster analysis of log2-ratio data from all platforms yielded clusters of samples grouped according to the three cell lines showing a high overall correlation between the  <dig> platforms  and inter-platform  correlation, see fig. 2). we observed that one of the amersham jurkat samples clustered slightly apart from the other two jurkat samples, consistent with the heterogeneity in the reproducibility of the amersham observed in figure  <dig>  however, visual inspection of the array images, overall distributions of the data  and the equal percentage of available data points  for jurkat samples relative to the other cell line samples  did not provide an explanation for this observation.

nevertheless, we found a significant number of aberrant target measurements unique to particular platform. here the data from px was included in order to confirm the discordance in target measurement observed for a particular platform. we found that while most of the  <dig>  targets had a similar overall expression values between the  <dig> platforms  <dig> targets were found to be discordant across the different platforms . of these, we found  <dig> targets that were discordant uniquely for either affymetrix, agilent or amersham . of the three platforms, agilent contributed the lowest number of discordant expression values  compared to affymetrix and amersham . the discordant targets found for agilent were dispersed evenly into three agilent quantile bins  whereas 91% of the discordant targets unique to amersham in its lowest  <dig> intensity quantiles  suggesting a problem of sensitivity . we found that 60% of the discordant targets found for affymetrix were in its q <dig> and q <dig> quantiles suggesting a more fundamental problem in target identification.

differences in target availability and discordant expression values between the platforms may be related to the differences in feature design, sequence and their placement along the target transcript. recent sequence-based identification studies have suggested that annotations attributed to target sequence is a non-negligible source of discrepancy between technologies  <cit> . using a sequence-based identification for affymetrix probe sets on the hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  arrays harbig et al. not only re-named over  <dig>  probe sets but flagged over  <dig>  probe sets that specifically hybridize to either more than one splice variants  or transcripts from different loci . we should note that none of the affymetrix probe sets flagged by harbig et al. were among the  <dig>  k set. unfortunately, comparisons between the different platforms, at this level, were not feasible as feature location and sequence information are publicly available for only affymetrix and agilent.

agreement in the identification of differentially expressed genes
starting from all available targets out of the  <dig>  k set for each platform we performed independent anova and t test analyses. from the anova analyses, we obtained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  significant targets  for affymetrix, amersham and agilent, respectively . based on all  <dig> possible multivariate permutations for a given platform we found that the probability of obtaining these results by chance if there are no real differences between the classes was  <dig> . we found a lower percentage of the total amount of "anova targets"  attributed with intra-platform quantile q <dig> for all platforms. affymetrix data yielded fewer anova targets  in its q <dig> and q <dig> bins compared to the 22% and 32% found for agilent  <dig> k and amersham, respectively. we found roughly the same percentage of anova targets  that had similar levels of expression for each respective platform . of these, approximately the same low proportion  corresponded to low-expressing transcripts . overall, these results suggest that there is a common limitation of the  <dig> technologies to detect differences in expression of the lowest expressing genes.

based on the anova results we found the least amount of commonality from the amersham data . of the  <dig> targets unique to amersham,  <dig> were available  for all platforms,  <dig> of which were expressed at high levels  and  <dig> yielded p values >  <dig>  for both affymetrix and agilent. moreover, 69%  of the anova targets found by agilent and affymetrix yielded p values superior to  <dig>  for amersham. limiting the tests to the identification of genes that discriminate mcf <dig> and batt p <dig> samples we observed a much lower number of genes  common to all  <dig> different platforms. we also observed a higher level of discordance with the agilent data. taking all tests into consideration, we found a slightly higher level of agreement  in the identification of discriminating genes from the affymetrix data.

evaluation of relative expression measures compared to qrt-pcr data
in order to address the discrepancies in accuracy mentioned above we analyzed  <dig> genes  using real-time qrt-pcr. these genes passed the pre-processing filters in at least one out all of the samples studied. in addition, these genes were selected based on either  <dig>  complete concordance  or discordance between either their measured expression levels  and/or being identified as a discriminating gene between the different platforms ;  <dig>  three genes  known to be highly expressed in mcf <dig> cells  <cit> . erbb <dig> and rps6kb <dig> corresponded to multiple targets to a different extent for the  <dig> platforms and were therefore excluded from the overall correlation calculation between rt-pcr and array data as well as from the all gene-wise comparison . the  <dig> genes covered a large dynamic range of expression levels ; minimal ct =  <dig>  , see  for all array data and sample-matched qrt-pcr ct values for the corresponding genes).

despite a high overall correlation between array and rt-pcr data  we found several discrepancies between the different platforms. based on the rt-pcr data we detected  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes in all  <dig> samples . rag <dig> was out of the limit of detection in battp <dig> and mcf <dig> samples while detected in jurkat samples. rag <dig> was equally filtered out for battp <dig> and mcf <dig> in  <dig> out of the  <dig> replicate agilent arrays and all of the replicate amersham arrays, whereas this gene was found to be a "unique anova" target for affymetrix. casp <dig> was below the level of detection in jurkat but yielded high ct values in battp <dig> and mcf <dig> samples. however, for the agilent data, casp <dig> was detected by all arrays barring one battp <dig> replicate array. casp <dig> was considered a low expressing gene for in all affymetrix arrays  and amersham arrays . it should be noted that the data provided by agilent was derived from experiments in which about 1/ <dig> of the amount of material was used for a hybridization  in accordance with their recommended protocol. as expected, rt-pcr values for erbb <dig>  rps6kb <dig>  bcas <dig> were relatively higher in mcf <dig> compared to the other samples. similarly, all  <dig> platforms yielded consistently high relative expression values for rps6kb <dig> and bcas <dig>  array data for erbb <dig>  however, were found to be equally inconsistent from all  <dig> platforms.

a gene by gene analysis of the expression relative to the reference sample revealed a high agreement between array data and qrt-pcr data . this observation was independent of the overall expression level as assessed by the average ct values for each gene. here, 'agreement' refers to the same direction of relative expression  for a gene in a given cell line relative to the reference sample. we found that affymetrix yielded a slightly higher overall score compared with the other  <dig> platforms. a recent paper studying the correlation between affymetrix hg-u133a data  from  <dig> genes and qrt-pcr data found an equally high correlation  with both methods for roughly 85% of the genes  <cit> . they found poor correlations with genes that were either expressed at low levels or those for whose probe sets were not adequately designed. based on our analysis we did not observe an expression-level dependence on the correlation between affymetrix, agilent and amersham array data and the qrt-pcr data.

we extended this analysis to an all gene pair-wise comparison of relative expression levels as a function of fold change . for this, the relative expression levels  between all pairs of genes across all  <dig> cell lines from the qrt-pcr data were calculated. values that were filtered out by either agilent or amersham were not included in the comparison and thus we did not penalize these  <dig> platforms for missing values. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  combinations were considered for ratio and single intensity array data, respectively . each gene pair combination was attributed to  <dig> out of  <dig> fc bin depending on its qrt-pcr value. we then analyzed the concordance of log2-ratio  array data to -ΔΔct qrt-pcr data by -ΔΔct fc bins. to optimize comparisons with single intensity platforms we also compared -Δct qrt-pcr values to log2-intensity values as a function of -Δct fc bins. figure  <dig> shows box plots of the distributions of the ratios obtained from array data of the gene pair combinations per fc bin. although we observe a general trend of array fc levels concordant with the qrt-pcr data, transforming single intensity data into log2-ratios resulted in a marked reduction in the range of array fcs . based on log2-ratio array data and -ΔΔct data we observed a closer relationship of agilent fcs to qrt-pcr fcs . we also observed that for extreme fcs calculated based on qrt-pcr  25% of the fcs obtained from amersham ratio data were below  <dig>  if, however, we base our assessment of single-intensity platforms on single-intensity data we see a much closer correlation with qrt-prc data, particularly for affymetrix which yielded a near linear relationship with qrt-pcr data ranging from the minimal to the maximal fc bin .

CONCLUSIONS
our study compares the latest, state-of-the-art short and long oligonucleotide human-microarray commercial technologies. the results presented here were used for the program cit, a centralized, multi-tumor program as well as for a similar program launched by the canceropole ile-de-france  in choosing a human genome-based microarray technological platform that can meet a high-throughput demand. therefore, the design of the study was adapted to judge each company in the context of these types of programs. in this context, our results show that all platforms yielded reproducible and comparable data. nevertheless, between the  <dig> technologies we found that one-color platforms were more precise while affymetrix and agilent were more concordant based on the agreement of expression measurements and identification of differentially expressed genes. in addition, affymetrix was found to have a slightly higher sensitivity at detecting relative differences in gene expression levels  and an overall higher level of concordance with the qrt-pcr data.
