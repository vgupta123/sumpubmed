BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a common bacteria of the commensal flora and together with other bacterial species, colonizes the nasopharyngeal niche and upper respiratory tract. pneumococcal colonization is mostly asymptomatic, but can progress to respiratory or even systemic disease, causing the majority of community-acquired pneumonia and invasive diseases such as meningitis and bacteremia. risk groups include young children, elderly people and patients with immunodeficiencies. in usa and europe the annual incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> per  <dig>  <dig> with a mortality rate of  <dig> to 50%; the highest incidence concerns people older than  <dig> years  <cit> . the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia is very high in developing countries, and estimated to cause every year the death of more than  <dig> million children under the age of five. the current seven-valent conjugate vaccine for children is effective against pneumococcal invasive diseases caused by the vaccine-type strains. as more than  <dig> serotypes have been described, the vaccine coverage is limited and non-vaccine serotypes replacement is a serious threat for the near future  <cit> . the search for new vaccine candidates that would elicit protection against a broader range of pneumococcal strains or for new drugs to circumvent pneumococcal invasive disease is of tremendous interest.

over the past  <dig> years, the importance of proteins for s. pneumoniae virulence has become clear. research has been stimulated by the observation that pneumococcal proteins, and more precisely, surface-exposed proteins, represent promising candidates for the development of vaccines that could be common to all pneumococcal serotypes  <cit> . mechanisms and pneumococcal factors that enable host epithelial and tissue barriers to be breached during the progression from colonization to invasive infection are still poorly understood. the role of the capsular polysaccharides in virulence has long been studied  <cit> . in order to better understand the pathogenic processes of pneumococcus, screens have been conducted, with very diverse methodologies, which allowed the identification of proteins potentially involved in host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . it now appears clearly that cell-surface proteins participate in many stages of the colonization process and/or the disease transition.

one of the first identified virulence factor of the pneumococcus is the toxin pneumolysin  <cit>  which is able to interfere with the immune system  <cit>  as well as directly destabilize host's membranes  <cit> . interactions of pspa and cbpa with lactoferrin and factor h, respectively as well as proteolysis of iga <dig> play important roles in the escape from the innate immune system  <cit> . the pneumococcal glycosidases nana, nanb and spnhl cleave terminal sugars from human glycoconjugates, which might reveal receptors for bacterial adherence and/or help for spreading of the bacteria  <cit> . contrary to other pathogenic bacteria, very few interactions of pneumococcal proteins with extracellular matrix components have been described. one example is the interaction of pava with fibronectin  <cit> . direct adherence of pneumococci to epithelial cells was shown to be mediated by choline-binding protein a  and psaa which bind to polymeric ig receptor and e-cadherin, respectively  <cit> . finally, a way to progress into host tissue is to recruit the host protease plasmin at the bacterial surface. we recently demonstrated that the pneumococcal surface-exposed cbpe is a receptor for the plasminogen , activation of which into plasmin facilitates traversal of s. pneumoniae through  a reconstituted basement membrane, and  epithelial and endothelial cell barriers via a pericellular route  <cit> .

beside the secreted or membrane-anchored protein associated with n-terminal peptide signal, three major groups of pneumococcal cell-surface proteins have been identified from specific sequence motifs which are related to three different attachment modes to the cell wall, composed by peptidoglycan, teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids. teichoic and lipoteichoic acids are decorated with phosphorylcholine  residues that anchor a group of proteins, the choline-binding proteins . these proteins harbor repeated sequences of approximately  <dig> amino acids, the choline-binding module, generally present in the c-terminal part of the protein. two to twelve modules form the choline-binding domain is attached to pcho in a non-covalent manner. beside the choline-binding domain, the amino-acid sequences vary greatly and for some cbps, various enzymatic activities or binding properties have been identified. the virulence factors pspa, cbpa, lyta and cbpe are part of this protein family. secondly, in gram-positive bacteria, proteins can be covalently linked to the peptide moiety of the peptidoglycan  <cit> . transpeptidase enzymes called sortases catalyze this anchorage on a specific amino-acid sequence motif: lpxtg. this motif can vary from the canonical lpxtg sequence, this is the case for the pilin proteins . the pneumococcal glycosidases nana, and spnhl are members of this lpxtg proteins family. thirdly, cell-surface lipoproteins are covalently linked to the membrane phospholipids through the n-terminus lxxc motif recognized by the signal peptidase ii. psaa is a lipoprotein.

the availability of genomic sequence data for pneumococcal strains has facilitated the identification of additional pneumococcal surface proteins, relying on searches for specific signatures in sequences of open reading frames. for example, the initial analysis of the genomic sequence of the tigr <dig> strain  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes encoding for proteins predicted to be exposed at the surface of the pneumococcus, using one of the  <dig> attachment modes. this protein set included  <dig> predicted proteins with the peptidoglycan anchor lpxtg-like motif,  <dig> predicted cbps,  <dig> proteins with putative lipid-attachment motifs   <cit> . in the r <dig> strain, a comparable set of proteins display bacterial surface motifs even though not in the same number:  <dig> lpxtg proteins linked to the peptidoglycan,  <dig> cbps and  <dig> lipoproteins . the authors mentioned that overall  <dig> proteins contain a predicted signal peptide sequence, an indication of their bacterial surface location, either through membrane anchoring or by secretion in the extracellular space and bound somehow to the cell wall  <cit> .

to date, pneumococcal surface proteins acting as virulence factors and playing a role in colonization and disease are overall about  <dig> . taking into account the large number of predicted surface-exposed, and the lack of knowledge on key aspects of the physiopathology of the pneumococcus, we assume that understanding of pneumococcal disease might greatly profit from the study of yet unstudied surface-exposed proteins. in order to identify new host-pneumococcal interactions that may play roles in colonization and disease progress, we have designed a global screening strategy. we first evaluated the ability of the pneumococcus to adhere to host components. then we cloned and expressed pneumococcal proteins from the cbps and the lpxtg protein families to systematically test the interactions of these proteins against host proteins. we thus obtained a map of pneumococcal surface proteins interactions with twelve mammalian proteins putatively encountered during the colonization and/or invasion stages. this work allowed the identification of new protein-protein interactions between cbp, lpxtg proteins and host proteins, and gives renewed view of the respective roles of cbp and lpxtg proteins, opening the route for in depth study of the interactions uncovered.

RESULTS
binding of pneumococcal strains r <dig> and tigr <dig> to host proteins
we first investigated the ability of pneumococcal strains to interact with a wide range of host proteins likely encountered by bacterial pathogens  <cit> : extracellular matrix proteins , circulating plasma proteins acting in the coagulation cascade  and proteins involved in the innate immune defense . binding of the r <dig> strain to these host proteins was tested in a solid-phase assay. host proteins or bovine serum albumine  as a negative control were coated on a multi-well plate. fitc-labeled pneumococcus was added and fitc signal was measured after washings of the plate to compare binding of the pneumococcus to bsa and host components . the threshold for considering a positive interaction was twice the bsa negative control. consequently, no significant binding of r <dig> bacteria was detected to collagen type iv, to a mix of different collagens or to elastin. a low binding level  was observed for crp, fibrinogen, fibronectin, mucin and sap while a higher level of binding was detected to laminin, lactoferrin, plasminogen and factor h . a similar experiment has been performed with the encapsulated tigr <dig> strain . no, or very low binding level, was observed for the tigr <dig> strain to the collagen type iv, fibronectin, mucin and sap and a slight higher interaction with crp, fibrinogen, laminin, collagens and elastin. a high binding level of the tigr <dig> strain was measured to lactoferrin, plasminogen and factor h . both r <dig> and tigr <dig> strains bind strongly to the lactoferrin and factor h, while the high binding level of r <dig> to laminin and plasminogen is less important in the case of the tigr <dig> strain, the latter harbors a higher recognition property to the elastin compared to the r <dig> strain.

interaction of pneumococcal cells with laminin  <cit> , crp  <cit> , fibronectin  <cit>  and mucin  <cit>  have been described in the literature. all other identified interactions are not described to date, and to investigate these interactions at the molecular level, we designed an approach to systematically test interactions between selected pneumococcal surface proteins and host proteins.

identification, expression and purification of choline-binding proteins 
we built a list of the cbps present in the r <dig> and tigr <dig> genomes using the published data  <cit> . from these sequences,  <dig> genes encoding cbps were predicted in the r <dig> genome, and  <dig> in the tigr <dig> genome . we systematically compared the tigr <dig> and r <dig> protein databases derived from their complete genome sequence in order to get a list of orthologs between the two organisms. this work was facilitated by the high level of conservation of gene organization between both genomes. this analysis led to the identification of two new cbps in the r <dig> genome not identified in the initial study  <cit> , namely spr <dig> and spr <dig> . in order to homogenize the nomenclature, we named these newly identified choline-binding proteins cbpl  and cbpm . the cbpg  <cit>   ortholog in the r <dig> strain is split in two proteins: spr <dig> contains a peptidase domain and spr <dig> is a very small protein  with a single predicted choline-binding domain. thus, cbpg does not seem to exist in the r <dig> strain as a cbp. taking all these data together, we conclude that the r <dig> and tigr <dig> genomes encode for  <dig> and  <dig> cbps respectively. figure  <dig> gives a comprehensive overview of the cbps in streptococcus pneumoniae strains r <dig> and tigr <dig>  this classification points out that names previously used to identify the cbps were confusing. for instance, the ortholog of pcpc in tigr <dig>  is named cbpf in r <dig>  and the ortholog of cbpf in tigr <dig>  is pcpc in r <dig> . as cbpf was studied in r <dig>  <cit>  under that name, we chose to rename sp <dig> and spr <dig> cbpk. pcpa was also renamed cbpn. we didn't rename well studied cbps such as pspa, lyta, lytb and lytc. a similar analysis has been performed with the strains g <dig>  and hungary 19a- <dig>  . the g <dig> strain contains  <dig> cbps among which only the cbpj is absent, while  <dig> cbps have been identified in the hungary 19a- <dig> strain which does not express cbpi, cbpj and cbpg.

the level of sequence identity between the r <dig> and tigr <dig> cbps orthologs was determined by kalign http://msa.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/msa.cgi and ranged between 84% and 99%, except for pspa with 63% of sequence identity. some of the cbps present slight differences in their general topology: tigr <dig> cbpk is larger than r6's and has  <dig> more choline-binding domains. tigr <dig> cbpn is reduced by  <dig> choline-binding domains. both cbpa have roughly the same size, but  <dig> more choline-binding domains are predicted in the r <dig> protein.

cbps can be separated into three classes: some of them have no predicted domain except the choline-binding domain, as cbpi, pspa, cbpf, cbpj, cbpk, cbpm , and cbpn . other cbps present additional domains with identified enzymatic functions . finally some cbps exhibit additional predicted domains of unknown functions . all the genes encoding the cbps were cloned, excluding genes coding for the lyt proteins as their roles are well documented. cbpe was already cloned in the laboratory  <cit> . pspa, cbpn and cbpd were not expressed. cbpg and cbpk were expressed as an insoluble form: these proteins were not studied further. cbpa, cbpe, cbpf, cbpi, cbpj, cbpl and cbpm were successfully purified.

expression and purification of lpxtg proteins
a comparable analysis has been conducted with the lpxtg proteins . there are genes for  <dig> and  <dig> lpxtg family members identified in the tigr <dig> and r <dig> genomes, respectively  <cit> . ten lpxtg proteins are common to the r <dig> and tigr <dig> genomes meaning that some of these surface-exposed proteins are specific to either r <dig> or tigr <dig> strains. five lpxtg proteins are specific of tigr <dig>  among which the pilin proteins encoded at loci sp <dig>  sp <dig> and sp <dig> and thought to be covalently associated to each other via their lpxtg-like motif by specific pilus-sortase enzymes  <cit> . because these particular lpxtg proteins are not linked to the peptidoglycan by the housekeeping sortase a, they have not been included in this study. two other lpxtg proteins are present in the tigr <dig> strain and absent from the r <dig> strain: the metalloprotease zmpc and psrp, a very large protein  essentially composed of a serine rich region  <cit> . three new r <dig> orthologs were identified: proteins endod , zmpb  and zmpa  . nana  and pcla  are present in the r <dig> strain but not in tigr <dig>  among the lpxtg proteins, spr <dig> does not have a lpxtg motif, as was initially reported  <cit>  nor a gram-positive anchor, was thus excluded from our study. cbpa  is identified both as cbp and lpxtg protein in the tigr <dig> annotations. as we did not find a lpxtg motif in sp <dig>  it was excluded from the lpxtg proteins list and kept with the cbps . the initial inaccurate annotation as an lpxtg protein likely originates from the presence of an allelic variant of cbpa harboring an lpxtg motif in some pneumococcal strains  <cit> . finally, the r <dig> strain has  <dig> genes encoding for lpxtg proteins compared to  <dig> for the tigr <dig> strain. protein sizes range from  <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa . some of them are enzymes  while others may be involved in molecular recognition . the sequence identity between lpxtg orthologs found in r <dig> and tigr <dig> strains ranged between 89% and 100%, except for the zmpb protein which sequence identity is 52%. most of the lpxtg proteins have a comparable domain organization in both strains. a similar analysis has been performed with the strains g <dig> and hungary 19a- <dig> . the g <dig> and hungary 19a- <dig> strains encode for  <dig> and  <dig> lpxtg proteins, respectively. the pilus operon is missing in the g <dig> strain as well as the pcla and psrp sequences, neither the genes encoding for zmpc nor pcla are present in the hungary 19a- <dig> strain.

as lpxtg proteins are often large, selected domains were cloned for protein expression for most of them . all cloning were successful except for pcla. all the constructs were positively tested for protein expression and led to the production of soluble recombinant forms.

protein interactions screening by solid-phase assay
in order to study on a large scale the interactions of the pneumococcal choline-binding proteins and lpxtg proteins with host components, a solid-phase test to screen for interactions between the purified his-tagged pneumococcal proteins and host components was designed and automated. chosen mammalian proteins, already tested with pneumococci , were either part of the extracellular matrix  or circulating proteins . these proteins were coated on a  <dig> wells plate and the interaction with the purified recombinant his-tagged pneumococcal proteins was detected using an anti his-tag antibody coupled to the hrp enzyme and revealed by chemiluminescence. each interaction experiment was conducted at least three times using two or more different protein preparations. interactions observed in a majority of at least three independent experiments are considered as positives .

this table summarizes the elisa interaction experiments. each positive interaction was validated in a majority of at least  <dig> independent experiments  and is represented by a cross. empty boxes stand for an absence of detected interaction. pneumococcal proteins are figured on the left and the tested mammalian proteins are at the top of the table, those giving no interaction have been grouped at the right of the table.

interaction profile of the choline-binding proteins
elastin is the extracellular matrix component showing the largest number of interactions with cbps: cbpi, cbpl and cbpf, while collagens interact only with cbpl and laminin only with cbpe . the most frequent interactions have been observed with circulating proteins, such as crp, factor h and plasminogen. four different cbps interact with crp: cbpi, cbpm, cbpj and cbpl. cbpe and cbpa, interact with factor h, the latter interaction confirming previous results  <cit> , plasminogen interacts with cbpe and cbpf . interactions between cbpe and laminin or plasminogen confirm our previous observations to which we add factor h herein  <cit> .

interaction profile of the lpxtg proteins
even though all expressed lpxtg proteins were produced as soluble recombinant proteins, some of them gave poor purification yield or poor signal detection during the screen. these restrictions led to the abandon in the screen assay of pavb, zmpa, mucb and psrp. the most common interactions encountered with the lpxtg candidates involved the collagen iv  and the plasminogen  . nana also interacts with collagens and fibrinogen . the interaction level of nana with lactoferrin was not significant in our assay contrary to a previous observation  <cit> .

dose-responses curves
we chose to investigate the dose-response of three unstudied cbps for which we observed host-protein binding functions: the solid-phase assay screening led to the observation that cbpl interacts with collagens, elastin and crp, cbpi binds to elastin and crp and cbpm binds only to crp. in this experiment,  <dig> μg of each mammalian protein is coated and increasing amounts of pneumococcal proteins is used, from  <dig>  to  <dig> pmoles per well. for all three analyzed cbps, the interaction with mammalian proteins is dose-dependent . the highest level of binding of cbpl is observed with elastin, intermediate response with collagens and crp compared with the bsa negative control . these data confirm the results of the screen, and also comfort the "semi-quantitative" informations about the level of binding that we obtained from the screen. the interaction of cbpi with elastin and crp yielded the most important response levels in the dose-response measurements, in accordance with the screen assay but a significant level of interaction was also observed with collagens . even though the sole interaction of cbpm which came out from the screen procedure was with crp, confirmed in the dose-response analysis, this more detailed characterization allows to propose that cbpm interacts with elastin but too weakly to be considered as positive during the screen procedure . all together these results validate the procedure that we used to select the interactions that emerge from the screen.

discussion
we have presented an experimental set up that allowed the analysis of the binding properties of  <dig> surface-exposed pneumococcal proteins, leading to the screen of more than  <dig> interactions, most of which have never been reported in the literature before. the validity of this approach is strengthened by the fact that known interactions were « rediscovered ». for example, we confirmed the interaction between cbpa and factor h  <cit> . complementary elisa analysis gave a confirmation of the validity of our procedure on chosen protein-protein interactions. from this screen, we conclude that whereas lpxtg proteins do not appear to be major adhesins, cbps seem to be more important players in the adhesion processes. one explanation can be that most of the cbps are not associated with enzymatic functions . probably the main function of the cbps  resides in the host-pathogen interaction, and adhesion processes. most of the lpxtg proteins do exhibit complex 'multi'-functions , rendering plausible the hypothesis that they have more diverse functions at the surface of the bacteria. indeed, the results obtained tend to minimize their roles in the adhesion processes. however one has to keep in mind that often only part of the lpxtg proteins was tested as they are usually larger proteins than the cbps. it's possible that this bias led us to miss significant interactions. another point is that only protein-protein interactions were tested during the course of the screen. yet carbohydrates are important components of the host, they were not included in that study and could be an important target of the lpxtg proteins, in particular for the ones that bear carbohydrate-binding modules as it was recently proven for spua  <cit> . finally, this screen addressed a small fraction of host factors potentially involved in the interactions with the pneumococcus. thus our screen gives an overview of some protein-protein interactions and extension on this work would require higher throughput techniques such as those based on chips. it's interesting to note that some of the lpxtg found to be adhesins during the course of this screen are proteases such as prta and zmpb. one tempting hypothesis that has already been proposed for prta  <cit>  could be that these proteins are involved in the cleavage of host proteins in order to penetrate into the tissues or escape the immune system. future research will have to elucidate these questions and in particular, the fate of the mammalian proteins after the interactions.

during the course of the screen, we identified  <dig> cbps, cbpi, cbpl and cbpm that interact with elastin. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that interactions of pneumococcal proteins with elastin are discovered. elastin is a major component of the lungs and blood vessels, and is thus probably frequently encountered by the bacteria. cbpi and cbpl are only expressed in the tigr <dig> strain and harbor a high level binding to elastin, while cbpm is specific of the r <dig> strain and binds weakly to elastin. these data are in accordance with the bacterial binding pattern to elastin: no interaction of the r <dig> strain was observed with elastin while the tigr <dig> strain presents a significant binding property to elastin, indicating that in this latter strain, and despite the presence of the capsule, the recognition to elastin might be due to cbpi and cbpl . these newly characterized interactions open the way to a better understanding of the contribution of choline-binding proteins during the invasion process. considering the general interest in the identification and validation of new protein vaccine candidates, that would elicit protection against a broader range of pneumococcal strains and/or play a significant role in the virulence process, it is interesting to note that all the identified recombinant proteins that positively interact with the host proteins are also present in the g <dig> and hungary 19a- <dig> strains, except cbpj in both strains and cbpi in the latter strain.

we also observed an interaction between some cbps and the crp. the interaction between streptococcus pneumoniae and crp is one of the first identified host-pathogen interaction at the molecular level  <cit> . crp stands for c reactive protein, with c standing for c polysaccharide, which contains the teichoic and lipoteichoic acids from pneumococcus. in fact, crp is interacting with phosphocholines   <cit>  harbored by teichoic and lipoteichoic acids. the possibility exists that cbps could harbor in their choline-binding domains enough pcho to reproduce this interaction. however, it's important to note that not every purified cbp did interact with crp, leaving opened the question of a direct interaction between cbps and crp.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented an experimental design that allowed the analysis of the binding properties of  <dig> surface-exposed pneumococcal proteins, leading to the discovery of  <dig> new interactions with host proteins. this screen opens the route for in depth study of the role of these surface exposed proteins in the virulence processes,
