BACKGROUND
phages can be divided into virulent or temperate based on their relationship with the host. temperate phage inserts and integrates into its host genome upon infection, and can reside as quiescent prophage. prophage does not infect its host and maintains the dormant state  <cit> . whole-genome sequencing reveals that prophage dnas are widespread among bacterial genomes, even up to 20% of the host genome content  <cit> . prophages are important genetic components transferred horizontally that can impart bacterial genome variability, evolution, and virulence  <cit> . some prophage genes contribute to the adaptation of bacteria to their specific ecological niches  <cit> . this has been demonstrated in many bacteria  <cit> , but a little is known for mycobacterium prophages.

there is huge gap between the number of mycobacteriophages isolated and cognate prophages found within mycobacteria. to date, there are  <dig> mycobacteriophages isolated and  <dig> of them with genome sequenced. they can be assembled into  <dig> clusters  and seven of them are singletons  <cit> . in contrast with large number of sequenced mycobacteriophages, their cognate prophages are poorly defined. only the following mycobacterioprophage sequences have been described. two prophage-like elements, phirv <dig> and phirv <dig>  have been detected in mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv genome  <cit> ; two prophage-like elements, phimu <dig> and phimu <dig>  are found within m. ulcerans agy <dig> genome  <cit> ;  <dig> putative prophages, named phimmar01– <dig>  are found in m. marinum m and two of them, phimmar <dig> and phimmar <dig>  are full-length prophages  <cit> ; the m. abscessus atcc  <dig> chromosome contains a full-length prophage and three prophage-like elements  <cit> ; prophage araucaria is found in m. abscessus subsp. bolletii bd genome  <cit> ; two prophages are found in pathogen m. abscessus strain 47j <dig>  <cit> ; a potential prophage in m. abscessus m <dig> is described  <cit> ; m. massiliense strain m <dig> contains putative mycobacteriophage  <cit> ; a 55-kb region encodes a putative prophage in m. canettii stb-i  <cit> ; a 40-kb prophage is predicted in addition to two prophage-like elements also are seen in m. simiae strain dsm  <dig>  <cit> . many mycobacterium prophages remain to be characterized. knowledge regarding their genomic composition, distribution can facilitate the elucidation of the biology of mycobacterium.

in this study, we screened all available mycobacterium complete genomes sequences from genbank, shotgun assembly sequences from whole genome shotgun  databases, and searched for mycobacterioprophages in published literatures. together,  <dig> prophages were described in detail, and  <dig> of them were previously undocumented prophages among mycobacterium genomes. the genomes, gene contents, comparative genomics studies and the relationships among them were characterized.

RESULTS
prophages in mycobacteriumgenomes
though the identification of prophages from sequenced bacterial genomes is difficult  <cit> , prophage sequences can be found by several approaches. integrases are well-recognized diagnostic markers for prophages within bacterial genomes . web servers and programs for prophages identification are available . in this study, we used an integrated protocol to streamline the identification. firstly, phast  was used to search mycobacterium genomes. secondly, the presence or absence of the integrase genes was tested to exclude negative results. finally, mycobacterioprophage sequences were identified based on the homology between prophage orfs  and known phage genes. thirty mycobacterial complete genomes  were retrieved. eleven new prophages were identified. the genomic features of these newly identified mycobacterioprophages are described in table  <dig> table  <dig>

in the wgs databases, some mycobacteria containing prophages are also reported . since the whole genome sequences of these mycobacteria and the specific information of these prophages are not available, we searched for prophages in five mycobacterial shotgun assembly sequences contigs  using the method mentioned above. the results showed that prophages were found in some sequences contigs of m. abscessus strain 47j <dig>  m.abscessus m <dig>  and m.massiliense m <dig> . prophages previously reported in the genomes of m.canettii cipt  <dig> and m.simiae dsm  <dig> cannot be detected in our study. with annotated whole genomic sequence, this puzzle might be solved.

some mycobacteria harboring prophages have been detailed in previous studies  <cit> , which are included in table  <dig>  four of them contained in m.abscessus atcc  <dig> chromosome are not designated. we named them phimab_ <dig>  phimab_ <dig>  phimab_ <dig>  and phimab_ <dig>  respectively. we noted that two prophage, phimu <dig> and phimu <dig>  mentioned in m.ulcerans agy <dig> genome, lack specific information and cannot be detected.

overall, thirty-three prophages were described, and six prophages had been mentioned, but without specific information. eleven prophages were found from the complete genome database; five prophages were retrieved from the wgs databases; seventeen of them were reported prophages with specific sequence information. their size range was from 6 kb to  <dig>  kb. based on the length of prophage genome ,  <dig> prophages can be considered as full-length prophage. the remaining  <dig> prophages were prophage-like elements. the result showed that small prophage-like elements were more prevalent than putative full-length prophages. the small prophage-like elements might be more stable due to mutational decay and loss of some genes somehow involved in genome excision. small prophage-like elements were more stable and can be more easily detected than the full-length prophages. through the trna search tool,  <dig> prophages were integrated into trna genes . the frequency of trna integration was trna-leu , trna-arg , trna-val , trna-lys , trna-pro , trna-met , trna-phe , trna-gly , trna-ala . the genome of m.sp.kms, m.sp.mcs, m.avium  <dig>  m.tuberculosis h37rv, m.marinum m, m.abscessus atcc  <dig>  m.abscessus strain 47j <dig>  and m.massiliense strain m <dig> was polylysogenic.

new prophages of mycobacteriumgenomes
full-length prophage phimav_ <dig> in the genome of m. avium 104
prophage phimav_ <dig>  spanning from mav_ <dig>  to mav_ <dig> , contains sixty-three orfs , and is flanked by two 20-bp repeats  reminiscent of attl and attr sites. there is no predicted trna within the prophage. phimav_ <dig> cannot be categorized into any known phage clusters and might represent new singleton type  <cit> .

based on blast-p,  <dig> phimav_ <dig> orfs show more or less amino acid sequence similarity to other known phage genes, and  <dig> can be assigned functionalities based on homology . phimav_ <dig> genome consists of different functional modules .figure  <dig>

the lysis module consists of mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig>  which encode cutinase and glycosyl hydrolase respectively that can lyze bacterium and enable the release of progeny phages. the dna packaging and structural modules extend from mav_ <dig> to mav_ <dig>  mav_ <dig>  mav_ <dig>  and mav_ <dig> all encode putative tail protein. mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig> all encode putative structural protein. mav_ <dig>  mav_ <dig>  and mav_ <dig> encode phage tail tape measure protein, tail assembly chaperone, and phage capsid and scaffold protein. mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig> encode putative portal protein and phage terminase engaged in the phage head morphogenesis. the dna metabolism module includes mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig>  mav_ <dig> encodes exonuclease and mav_ <dig> encodes recombination and repair protein rect. the lysogeny module consists of mav_ <dig>  mav_ <dig>  mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig>  mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig> encode phage integrase and excisionase dna binding protein. both mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig> encode phage antirepressor protein.

in addition to orfs similar to other phage genes, two orfs show unexpected similarity to bacterial key proteins. mav_ <dig> encodes type vi secretion protein icmf , a core component of type vi secretion system in pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae or other pathogenic bacteria . based on blast-p, type vi secretion system was not documented in mycobacteria except for m.avium  <dig> and m.parascrofulaceum. icmf is involved in bacterial motility, adherence to epithelial cells, and conjugation frequency  <cit> , and has been reported in an avian pathogenic escherichia coli  strain  <cit> . in addition, mav_ <dig> encodes ppe family protein, a widespread mycobacterium unique protein. this implies that mav_ <dig> and mav_ <dig> play a role in the physiology and pathogenicity of m.avium  <dig> 

prophage-like elements phimav_2

grouping of full-length prophages
we searched all the literatures published so far about full-length mycobacterioprophages. only one prophage araucaria is assigned to a dori-like prophage  <cit> . blastn  and dot plot matrix of the genomes of full-length mycobacterioprophages and mycobacteriophage clusters  revealed that phi172_ <dig> shared sequence similarity to cluster a ; phimab_ <dig> shared an even weaker sequence similarity to subcluster f <dig> ; phimab47j26_ <dig> shared an even weak sequence similarity to subcluster f <dig> and cluster n ; phimab47j26_ <dig> shared an even weak sequence similarity to cluster p, subcluster f <dig>  and cluster n ; phi172_ <dig> shared an even weaker sequence similarity to subcluster f <dig> and cluster n . the remaining full-length prophages had no close relatives to any cluster. we proposed that phi172_ <dig> was grouped into cluster a, and other full-length mycobacterioprophages did not belong to any mycobacteriophage clusters and were ‘singletons’.

comparative genomics of prophage-like elements
dot plot matrix was generated for the complete genomes of  <dig> mycobacterioprophage-like elements in this study . the figure displays that phimmcs_ <dig>  phimkms_ <dig>  phibn44_ <dig>  and phimcan_ <dig> are more closely related to each other than to other mycobacterioprophage-like elements, and can be classified as one group. in a simple ncbi ‘align two sequences’comparison, the comparison between phimmcs_ <dig>  and phibn44_ <dig> shows that one of the major segments less than 2801 bp has greater than 71% identity, and four segments less than 200 bp are reported to have 68% identity . the comparison between reverse complementary sequence of phimcan_ <dig> and phibn44_ <dig> shows that one of the major segments 8952 bp has greater than 85% identity . further analysis indicated a lack of homology between the prophage of m.tuberculosis h37rv and other prophage-like elements.figure  <dig>

global comparison of phimmcs_ <dig> , phibn44_ <dig>  and phimcan_ <dig>  highly related sequences are shown by the red shadings. the blue shadings means that the dna fragments are highly homologous to complementary sequence of other fragments.



phylogeny of prophage integrases
integrase can be found in virtually each prophage genome found in this study. and it can serve as good marker for the phylogeny of prophage phirv <dig> element encodes a serine site-specific recombinase and phirv <dig> encodes a tyrosine recombinase  <cit> . all integrases fall into the two categories . the serine recombinase division includes phimycsm_ <dig>  phimmcs_ <dig>  and phirv <dig>  the tyrosine recombinase division includes the remaining prophages and phirv <dig>  phimmcs_ <dig> , phibn44_ <dig>  and phimcan_ <dig> belong to the same clade, consistent with the comparative genomic result. the distance between prophages had little relevance to the phylogeny between their hosts, suggestive of independent evolutionary trajectory.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in brief, we present here thirty-three mycobacterioprophages mined from sequenced mycobacterial genomes, the wgs databases, and some published literatures. eleven prophages were newly identified prophages from complete genome database; five prophages were from the wgs databases; seventeen prophages were reported with specific sequence information. the genome sequences, gene contents of eleven newly identified prophages were analyzed. comparative genomic analysis revealed that one full-length mycobacterioprophage phi172_ <dig> belonged to cluster a and one group having recognizable sequence similarity was verified and contained four small prophage-like elements, including the phimmcs_ <dig>  phimkms_ <dig>  phibn44_ <dig>  and phimcan_ <dig>  to our knowledge, this represents the first systematic analysis of mycobacterioprophages. with more forthcoming mycobacterium genome sequences and thorough mycobacterioprophages screening, we can generate a more comprehensive picture of the role of prophages in mycobacterial evolution, adaptations and physiology.
