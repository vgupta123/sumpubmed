BACKGROUND
vibrio cholerae is the etiological agent of the severe watery diarrhoeal disease known as cholera, a major public health concern in most developing countries.

more than  <dig> serogroups have been described on the basis of different somatic o antigens  <cit> , but only serogroups o <dig> and o <dig> have the ability to cause harsh epidemics. serogroup o <dig> is further divided into two main biotypes, classical and the 7th pandemic el tor. beside their phenotypic characteristics, differences in specific genetic markers, such as toxin structure, confer distinct features to these biotypes.

pathogenic v. cholerae strains carry the genes encoding the cholera toxin  on the ctxΦ prophage. different ctxΦ arrangements have been described within the o <dig> serogroup  <cit> . these arrangements depend on the genotype of the ct gene ctxb and on the organization and chromosomal location of several gene clusters of phage origin, namely the core, rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  <cit> . although the classical biotype is considered extinct, new el tor strains holding the classical ctxb allele, generically labeled as atypical el tor   <cit> , were identified from  <dig> to date mostly in asia  <cit>  with few cases in africa  <cit> . the atypical variants are characterized by a new ctxΦ arrangement, holding el tor and/or classical alleles of rstr and ctxb genes  <cit> . as a consequence of these genetic arrangements in ctx prophage, toxigenic v. cholerae o <dig> el tor strains have changed in the last  <dig> years. initially, atypical variants were only sporadically identified in the indian subcontinent along with prototype el tor. however they are now in the process of replacing it worldwide  <cit> .

prototype el tor strains often contain multi-resistant conjugative plasmids  <cit>  whereas o <dig> and atypical o <dig> el tor v. cholerae epidemic strains usually harbor integrative conjugative elements  of the sxt/r <dig> family  <cit> .

sxt/r <dig> ices are self-transmissible mobile elements, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, able to integrate into the host bacterial chromosome and to transfer by conjugation. they are recognized for their important role in bacterial genome plasticity  <cit>  and as vectors of antibiotic resistance and alternative metabolic pathways  <cit> . the name of the sxt/r <dig> family originates from elements sxtmo <dig> and r <dig>  respectively discovered in clinical strains of vibrio cholerae in india  <cit>  and providencia rettgeri in south africa  <cit> . the two elements are associated with different multi-resistance profiles: chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim for sxtmo <dig>  and kanamycin, and mercury for r <dig>  <cit> . they share a highly conserved genetic backbone encoding their integration/excision, conjugative transfer, and regulation, but also contain variable dna found in five insertion sites of the backbone  <cit> . each ice of the family holds specific genes scattered in the conserved sequence that code for resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals, new toxin/antitoxin systems, restriction/modification systems, and alternative metabolic pathways  <cit> . to date more than  <dig> ices have been identified and grouped within the sxt/r <dig> family, most of them discovered in v. cholerae strains.

to date, only a few sxt-related ices were identified in africa, most of them through the characterization of the integrase intsxt. only icevchmoz <dig> from mozambique  has been completely sequenced and annotated  <cit> . this ice has no close relative in africa except its sibling icevchban <dig> isolated in bangladesh , suggesting the possible spread of sxt-related ices between the two continents in recent times. although the use of horizontally-transferred elements as genetic markers for strain discrimination might appear risky, we recently showed the existence of an ice/strain association in epidemic v. cholerae strains circulating in the indian subcontinent  <cit> . the association between ice and v. cholerae reflects the classification proposed by chun and colleagues to describe homologous intraspecific groups of v. cholerae based on the whole genome alignment of  <dig> strains isolated over the past  <dig> years  <cit> .

in this retrospective study, we analysed v. cholerae o <dig> clinical strains isolated in luanda  in  <dig>  angola is an endemic area for cholera and was subjected to two major epidemic events in the past three decades. the first outbreak   <cit>  was followed by a thirteen year remission phase until cholera reemerged in  <dig> in one of the most severe epidemic outbreaks of the last decade, counting about  <dig>  cases  <cit> .

here we demonstrate that the v. cholerae o <dig> el tor strain responsible for the  <dig> angolan outbreak is an atypical o <dig> el tor variant previously detected only in asia  <cit> . this variant is significantly different from those isolated during previous cholera outbreaks in the 1990s in the same geographic area. indeed, it holds a peculiar ctxΦ array and the sxt-like element icevchang <dig>  ribotype analysis suggests that this strain might have spread to west africa from the indian subcontinent.

methods
bacterial strains, susceptibility tests and transfer of drug resistances
we analyzed v. cholerae strains isolated in angola or india between  <dig> and  <dig> . all strains were isolated from stool samples and/or rectal swabs from patients, and after isolation on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose agar and biochemical identification, bacterial strains were routinely grown in luria-bertani  or agar plates at 37°c and maintained at -80°in lb broth containing 30%  glycerol.

aresistance profile conferred by conjugative plasmid p3iang  <cit> ; blocated on the ice; clocated on p3iang; dice fully sequenced. abbreviations: ap, ampicillin; cm, chloramphenicol; kn, kanamycin; nx, nalidixic acid; pn, penicillin; sm, streptomycin; sp, spectinomycin; su, sulfamethoxazole; tc, tetracycline; tp, trimethoprim.

antimicrobial susceptibility was tested at the following concentrations: ampicillin ,  <dig> μg/ml; chloramphenicol ,  <dig> μg/ml; kanamycin ,  <dig> μg/ml; nalidixic acid ,  <dig> μg/ml; penicillin ,  <dig> μg/ml; rifampin ,  <dig> μg/ml; spectinomycin ,  <dig> μg/ml; streptomycin ,  <dig> μg/ml; sulfamethoxazole ,  <dig> μg/ml; tetracycline ,  <dig> μg/ml; and trimethoprim ,  <dig> μg/ml. antibiotic concentrations were defined according to their mic breakpoints as previously described  <cit>  and were included in iso sensitest  agar plates. bacterial strains were spotted onto the plates as previously described  <cit> .

conjugation assays were used to transfer icevchang <dig> from v. cholerae into rifampin-resistant derivatives of e. coli  <dig> strain. mating assays were performed by mixing equal volumes of overnight cultures of donor and recipient strains. briefly, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a 1/ <dig> volume of lb broth. cell suspensions were poured onto lb agar plates and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. the cells were then resuspended in  <dig> ml of lb medium, and serial dilutions were plated onto appropriate selective media to determine the numbers of donors, recipients, and exconjugants. frequency of transfer was expressed as the number of exconjugant cells per donor cells in the mating mixture at the time of plating.

v. cholerae o <dig> mo <dig>  <cit> , v. cholerae e4:icevchind <dig>  <cit> , v. cholerae o <dig> vc <dig>  <cit> , v. cholerae n <dig>  <cit> , v. cholerae o <dig> co <dig>  <cit> , v. cholerae o <dig> vc <dig>  vc <dig>  and vc <dig> isolated in india   <cit> , and e. coli ab1157:r <dig>  <cit>  were appropriately used as negative or positive controls for class  <dig> integrons, ice, tcpa, and rstr detection, ctxΦ array and ribotype analysis.

molecular biology procedures
bacterial dna for pcr analysis was prepared with a wizard genomic dna purification kit . amplicons to be sequenced were directly purified from pcr or extracted from agarose gel by wizard sv gel and pcr clean-up system  according to the manufacturer's instructions. dna sequences were determined by bmr genomics .

class  <dig> integron detection was performed by pcr amplification with specific primer pairs as previously described  <cit> . ices of the sxt/r <dig> family were screened by pcr analysis, using  <dig> specific primer pairs previously described by our group  <cit> . intsxt, prfc/sxtmo <dig> right junction, flor, stra, strb, sul <dig>  dfra <dig>  dfra <dig>  rumab operon, trai, trac, setr, and hotspots or variable regions s026/trai, s043/tral, traa/s <dig>  s073/traf and trag/eex were screened. a second set of  <dig> primer pairs designed on the specific sequences of icevchind <dig>  <cit>  were used to detect icevchind <dig> and icevchang <dig> specific hotspots and variable regions.

all pcr reactions were set in a 50-μl volume of reaction buffer containing  <dig> u of taq polymerase as directed by the manufacturer .

ribotype analysis
ribotyping of v. cholerae strains was performed by bgli restriction of chromosomal dna with fluorescent-labeled 16s and 23s dna  generated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of ribosomal rnas, as already described  <cit> .

ctx array analysis and ctxb, tcpa, rstr biotype characterization
the structure of ctx array was determined by multiple pcr analysis  and by southern blot hybridization. the genetic structure of the two ctx prophage arrays described in figure  <dig> was determined using the primers described in table  <dig>  briefly, combination of primers tlcf/rstar, tlcf/rstcr, rstcf/rstar, ctxaf/rstar, rstcf/rtxr and ctxaf/rtxr were used to detect the presence of ctxΦ on chromosome  <dig> and to determine the position of the rs <dig> element . the absence of ctxΦ or rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> was established using primers chr2f/chr2r. primers ctxaf/cepr were used to determine the presence of ctx tandem arrays.

three previously described primer sets were used to detect:  classical, el tor, or kolkata type rstr gene  <cit> ,  ctxb genotype sequencing  <cit> ,  and classical or el tor biotypes for tcpa  <cit> .

pcr results on organization and location of ctxΦ on chromosome  <dig> were further confirmed by southern blot hybridization assays. dna probes were produced by pcr using the chromosomal dna of v. cholerae strain n <dig> as template: ctxa gene  with primers ctx- <dig>  and ctx- <dig> ; rsta gene  with primers rsta1f  and rsta1r . probes for hybridization were labeled with alkaline phosphatase with alkphos direct™ labelling and detection system with cdp-star™ kit , according to manufacturer's instructions.

strains were cultured in luria-bertani medium and  <dig> ml of culture was used to extract and purify the genomic dna using the dneasy blood & tissue kit . aliquots of the extracted dna  were digested with ecorv for ctxΦ element restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. the digested fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis  and were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes using standard methods  <cit> . southern blots were hybridized o/n with ctxa or rsta labeled probes, and washed under stringent conditions, according to manufacturer's instructions. addition of cdp-star detection reagent was followed by  <dig> min incubation, and autoradiography  was performed to generate a signal.

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
nucleotide sequences of ctxb genes were deposited in genbank under accession no. hq <dig> , hq <dig> , hq <dig> , hq <dig> , and hq <dig> .

RESULTS
v. cholerae strains from  <dig> show reduced resistance profile compared to previous epidemic strains
we analyzed two v. cholerae o <dig> el tor clinical strains, vc <dig> and vc <dig> , isolated at the luanda central hospital . these strains were collected during the peak  of the cholera outbreak reported in angola in  <dig> 

the two strains were sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin but showed a multiresistant profile to ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole . despite this significant multidrug resistance, these strains showed a narrower resistance profile compared to those isolated in the previous 1987- <dig> cholera epidemic, which were also resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin and kanamycin  <cit> . we found no evidence for the presence of conjugative plasmids or class  <dig> integrons in the  <dig> strains analyzed , which might explain their reduced drug resistance profile. indeed, strains from 1987- <dig> were associated with the conjugative plasmid p3iang that holds genes encoding the resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and spectinomycin  <cit> .

icevchang <dig> is a sibling of icevchind5
we assessed the presence of sxt/r <dig> family ices since they are a major cause of antibiotic resistance spread among v. cholerae strains. both strains were intsxt+, were shown to contain an ice integrated into the prfc gene, and contained the conserved genes trai, trac and setr, respectively encoding a putative relaxase, a putative conjugation coupling protein, and a transcriptional repressor found in all sxt/r <dig> family members  <cit> . based on these results we included this ice in the sxt/r <dig> family and named it icevchang <dig> according to the accepted nomenclature  <cit> .

sxt/r <dig> ices exhibit significant genetic polymorphisms in hotspot content  <cit> . we used a first set of primers , designed to discriminate between sxtmo <dig> and r <dig> specific sequences  <cit> , in order to prove the identity of the ice circulating in the  <dig> angolan strains. genes flor, stra, strb, sul <dig>  dfra <dig>  dfra <dig>  the rumab operon, and hotspots or variable regions s026/trai, s043/tral, traa/s <dig>  s073/traf and trag/eex were screened.

the  <dig> strains exhibited the same sxtmo10/r <dig> hybrid ice pattern. intergenic regions trag/eex  and traa/s <dig>  showed the molecular arrangement described in sxtmo <dig>  whereas region s043/tral  was organized as in r <dig>  variable region  <dig>  inserted into the rumb locus, contained genes that mediate resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole: flor, stra, strb, sul <dig>  interestingly, icevchang <dig> lacks dfr <dig>  the gene conferring resistance to trimethoprim found in sxtmo <dig>  and carries instead dfra <dig> in hotspot  <dig>  this preliminary analysis revealed that icevchang <dig> exhibits a hybrid genetic content similar to that of the completely sequenced icevchind <dig>  the most widespread ice circulating in v. cholerae el tor o <dig> strains in the indian subcontinent  <cit> .

given these similarities we analyzed icevchang <dig> using a second set of primers  previously designed to assess the hotspot content of icevchind <dig>  <cit> . this analysis confirmed that all the peculiar insertions found in icevchind <dig> were also present in icevchang3:  a gene encoding a protein similar to the e. coli dam-directed mismatch repair protein mutl ;  inti <dig> integron ;  a possible transposon of the is <dig> family ; and  a  <dig> -kb hypothetical operon of unknown function . on account of our results and of the common backbone shared by sxt/r <dig> ices , we are confident that icevchang <dig> is a sibling of icevchind <dig>  <cit> . a map  of icevchang <dig> is shown in figure  <dig> 

we performed mating experiments to assess the ability of icevchang <dig> to transfer by conjugation between v. cholerae strain vc  <dig> or vc  <dig> and e. coli 803rif. the frequency of transfer of icevchang <dig> was  <dig>  x 10- <dig>  a frequency of transfer similar to that of most of the ices of this family. ten e. coli exconjugant colonies were tested and proved to be positive for the presence of intsxt, confirming the mobilization of icevchang <dig> 

a new ctxΦ array in africa
the variability of ctxΦ and the emergence of atypical el tor variants in the ongoing 7th pandemic  <cit>  les us to analyze the organization of ctxΦ arrays and the presence of different alleles of ctxb, rstr and tcpa genes. the genetic structure of ctx prophage in the genome of the angolan isolates from both epidemic events was determined by multiple pcr analysis, hybridization, and sequencing, when required.

combining the results obtained by multiple pcr analysis and hybridization we were able to show that the strains analyzed contained two distinct ctxΦ arrays , both of which were found integrated in the large chromosome . these strains also proved to be negative for any ctxΦ integration on the small chromosome and devoid of ctx tandem arrays as detected by primer pairs chr2f/chr2r and ctxaf/cepr, respectively. the angolan strains isolated in  <dig>  belonged to profile a, in which the rs <dig> element is followed by ctxΦ, both being located between the toxin-linked cryptic  element and the chromosomal rtx  gene cluster . in contrast, strains from the first outbreak  contained ctxΦ followed by the rs <dig> element  . both ctxΦ arrays were characterized by el tor type rstr genes  but showed a noteworthy difference in their ctxb genotype . ctxΦ arrays belonging to profile a contained a histidine and a threonine at the 39th and 68th amino acid positions, respectively, which are representative of classical genotype  <dig> ctxb. the ctxΦ arrays belonging to profile b held a tyrosine, a phenylalanine and an isoleucine at positions 39th, 46th and 68th, respectively, typical of an el tor genotype  <dig> ctxb.

cla, classical type; et, el tor type; aaccording to ctxb genotyping by safa et al.,  <dig>  <cit> ; bnucleotide position + <dig> corresponds to the a of the atg start codon in ctxb.

angolan and indian strains share the same clonal origin
in order to verify their clonal relationship, we analysed by ribotyping the strains from the two angolan epidemics of the 1990s and of  <dig>  as well as the indian strains collected from  <dig> to  <dig>   <cit> . strains from 1987- <dig> outbreak  were chosen according to their epidemiological role  and the presence of plasmid p3iang  <cit> .

angolan strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> showed an assorted ribotype profile: clinical strains vc <dig> and vc <dig> were characterized by profiles r <dig>  and r <dig> , respectively, and environmental isolate vc <dig> by a third completely different profile r <dig> . this heterogeneity is not surprising if we consider the angolan clinical strains on a larger sample scale. indeed, our data showed that there was a clonal shift in angola from  <dig> to 1993/ <dig> with consequent change of ribotype  that can explain the discrepancies observed here. strains vc <dig> and vc <dig> isolated in  <dig> were characterized by the same ribotype profile r <dig>  which corresponds to the ribotype profile of the indian strains carrying icevchind <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a common clonal origin.

discussion
 <dig> was a crucial year for cholera worldwide. the number of reported cases was higher than ever and exceeded the levels of the late 1990s. major outbreaks affected some of the largest african countries, including angola, which reported to who one of the most exceptional epidemics experienced in africa in the last decade  <cit> .

this is the first study on the causative agent of this dramatic outbreak and our analysis revealed significant differences between the angolan strains of  <dig> and those isolated in the previous 1987- <dig> cholera epidemic. the 1987- <dig> epidemic was the longest in angolan history and the v. cholerae epidemic strains were characterized by the presence of the conjugative plasmid p3iang that carries three class  <dig> integrons  <cit> . interestingly, the strains from the  <dig> outbreak lack p3iang but harbor an sxt-like ice sibling of icevchind <dig>  previously described only in asian v. cholerae strains  <cit> . the gene content of icevchang <dig> comprises elements shared with sxtmo <dig>  r <dig>  icevchban <dig>  and icepdaspa <dig>  alongside some unique insertions of unknown function that might provide the strain with increased fitness. in light of its genetic content we included icevchang <dig> in the subgroup of sxt/r <dig> ices that characterizes v. cholerae o <dig> el tor strains circulating in several epidemic areas of the indian subcontinent, of which icevchind <dig> is the reference ice  <cit> .

beside the analysis of the mozambican variant, extensive studies of ctxΦ arrangements in v. cholerae strains isolated in africa lack so far.

our analysis reports that the strains of the  <dig> outbreak contain an rs1-ctx array on the large chromosome with a classical ctxb allele, which classifies them as v. cholerae o <dig> altered el tor. this variant was responsible for major epidemics in india in 2004- <dig>  <cit>  and in vietnam in  <dig>  <cit> . it is considered as prevalent in asia nowadays  <cit>  and forms a monophyletic group with other variants of the 7th pandemic clade  <cit> . this variant arose in the indian subcontinent at the beginning of the 90s and slowly diffused to asian countries  <cit> . the possible spread to africa was only suggested  <cit>  and some authors gave partial evidences supporting this hypothesis by strain ribotyping  <cit>  or ctxb genotyping  <cit> . with this work we ascertain the presence of this atypical el tor variant in africa and demonstrate it holds the responsibility for the  <dig> cholera epidemic in angola.

the angolan variant is the second example of atypical el tor variant described in austral africa, the first being the mozambican strain b <dig>  <cit> . however, this variant is different from the angolan one, since it holds a tandem ctxΦ array on the small chromosome  <cit> , contains a different ice   <cit> , and is closely related to the bangladeshi strain mj- <dig>  <cit> .

unlike b <dig> whose progenitor was identified as a kolkata hybrid strain from  <dig>  <cit> , we have no clear information on how the variant we found in angola penetrated austral africa. we can speculate that it arrived from the indian subcontinent through the same sub-saharan corridor used by cholera to enter africa at the beginning of the 7th pandemic  <cit> . during the '70s it spread from the horn of africa to senegal, guinea bissau and eventually arrived in angola: the new atypical variant might have disseminated by a similar route. this supposition might find some confirmation in the analysis performed by sharma and colleagues who proposed the spread of a distinct v. cholerae o <dig> strain from india to guinea bissau, where it was associated with an epidemic of cholera in  <dig>  <cit> . this hypothesis was based on the ribotype analysis of pre- and post- o <dig> v. cholerae o <dig> strains circulating in both countries. our ribotype analysis confirmed these data since the angolan strain from  <dig>  the clinical strains isolated in guinea bissau in 1994/ <dig>  <cit> , and clinical post-o <dig> v. cholerae o <dig> strains from india  <cit>  share the same profile, suggesting a common clonal origin. unfortunately, the genetic content of the strains isolated in guinea bissau, in terms of ice structure and ctxΦ array, was never investigated and our speculations cannot go any further.

whichever route of dissemination used by the new variant to spread from the indian subcontinent to africa, many evidences indicate that atypical v. cholerae strains are in the process of globally replacing the prototype el tor strains, as observed in angola.

CONCLUSIONS
cholera remains a global threat to public health and the recent outbreak in haiti is a distressing example of this situation  <cit> . in  <dig>  angola, which had reported no cholera cases since  <dig>  was affected by a major outbreak due to an atypical v. cholerae o <dig> el tor strain that was analyzed for the first time in our study. this altered el tor strain holds an rs1-ctx array on the large chromosome and a classical ctxb allele and likely replaced the previous prototype o <dig> el tor strain reported till  <dig>  the success of the new variant might depend on the combination of the respective predominant features of the el tor and classical biotypes: a better survival in the environment  <cit>  and the expression of a more virulent toxin  <cit> .
