BACKGROUND
rapid increases in sequence output and read length of next generation sequencing instruments, accompanied by reduced error rates, are revolutionising molecular biology  <cit> . as of may  <dig>  sequencing projects of  <dig> prokaryotic and  <dig> eukaryotic organisms, including five plants, are listed by ncbi as being ‘completed’  <cit> . indeed, as opposed to only a few years ago, the technological progress has been so great that nowadays the main difficulty has shifted from sequence acquisition to sequence assembly  <cit> .

the difficulty of sequence assembly is the most significant factor explaining the relatively small number of plant species with finished genome sequences. plant genomes tend to be large and highly repetitive, they have a propensity to contain large gene families and are frequently polyploid. for example, the wheat genome is estimated to be 90% repetitive  <cit> , it is hexaploid, and at  <dig> gb it is roughly  <dig> times the size of the human genome. any computational procedure for assembling such large and complex genomes must, therefore, be exceedingly efficient with both time and memory resources, but at the same time must be highly accurate to avoid mis-assembly of closely related sequences. for this reason, the sequencing of bread wheat  by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium  <cit>  is being carried out on individual flow-sorted chromosomes  <cit>  to  avoid the difficulty of simultaneous sequence assembly of closely related homoeologs. nevertheless, the significant challenges associated with assembling repetitive genomes  <cit>  make it likely that the availability of a finished, reliable, wheat genome sequence is still a number of years down the track.

wheat is one of the world’s most important food sources with a total world production of ~683 ×  <dig> metric tons  <cit> . it ranks with rice  and maize  among the world’s most cultivated crop plants. worldwide, significant efforts are underway to use modern biotechnology to assist wheat breeding programs to increase crop yield, nutritional content, salinity and drought tolerance, as well as biotic tolerance  <cit> . while knowledge of the full genome sequence of wheat is undeniably highly desirable for wheat improvement, for many purposes knowledge of the expressed portion of the genome, i.e. the transcriptome, is sufficient. for example, wheat transcriptome sequencing can be used to identify candidate genes for trait expression and to develop snp markers for tracking favourable alleles in breeding programs. knowledge of the transcriptome also greatly aids the design of microarrays and the interpretation of rna-seq experiments  <cit> . in one sense, assembly of the transcriptome is more straightforward than assembly of the genome in that one largely does not need to worry about the repetitive sequences that plague the latter. nevertheless, direct sequencing and assembly of the transcriptome of bread wheat is also not without challenges due to the presence of up to three highly similar homoeologs per locus.

in this contribution, we describe our work towards the sequencing and subsequent homoeolog-specific assembly of the wheat transcriptome and show, through comparison with existing sequence resources, that the resultant assembly goes a long way towards producing a comprehensive compendium of the gene sequences of bread wheat. as far as we are aware, a homoeolog-specific as opposed to homoeolog-blind assembly  of a polyploid transcriptome has not been performed before. after testing various assembly algorithms for their ability to produce homoeolog-differentiated assemblies, we decided on an assembly using a two-stage approach. first, a rough assembly was produced using the velvet/oases assembler  <cit> . this assembly was found to be mostly insensitive to the slight sequence differences between homoeologs, previously estimated to be about  <dig> snp per  <dig> bases  <cit> . it is convenient to think of the velvet/oases assembly as consisting, for the most part, of sequences with simultaneous contributions from the a, b and d genomes and, possibly, recent gene duplications. this assembly was used only to group reads into convenient clusters. in the second stage, reads in each cluster were re-assembled separately, using the high-precision assembler mira  <cit> . this assembler was found to be sufficiently sensitive to differentiate homoeologs in most cases. the two-stage approach was adopted because, given current computing  constraints, the direct assembly of a complex, polyploid, eukaryotic transcriptome using mira alone is not yet feasible. because the assembly of each cluster could be done independently, the second step was implemented in a highly parallel fashion on a compute cloud.

RESULTS
sequencing of the wheat transcriptome
wheat mrna from a single cultivar, the elite variety “kukri”  <cit> , was sequenced using: a) short-read illumina gaiix technology for sequencing depth, and b) long-read roche gsflx titanium technology for homoeolog-sensitivity. rna was extracted from root and shoot tissue from seedlings ranging from 8– <dig> days after germination, as well as florets collected at various stages from pre-meiosis to just prior to anthesis. collection from multiple tissues and developmental stages was essential in order to obtain a reasonably comprehensive representation of the complete transcriptome. the rna was normalized  <cit>  in order to reduce the dominance of abundantly expressed genes.

after quality checks, trimming of adapters and size selection using custom scripts   <dig> , <dig> illumina gaiix reads  and  <dig> , <dig> gs flx sequences , i.e.  <dig> , <dig> reads in total, were used as input to the sequencing assembly pipeline.

assembly algorithm performance testing
we investigated the suitability of various assembly algorithms by comparison to  <dig> validated bread wheat  homoeologous sequence triplets , obtained from  <cit>  and  <cit> . reads that bore some similarity to sequences in the om dataset were extracted from the illumina and gs flx reads and assembled, using various parameters, with abyss , velvet , velvet/oases  as well as mira . assembled contigs were subsequently compared to the om homoeologs, as described in methods, and evaluated according to criteria such as evidence of chimeric sembly of homoeologs, sequence length, total number of homoeologs assembled, etc. as can be seen in figure 1a, genome assemblers such as velvet and abyss tend to produce a significant number of chimeric assemblies of homoeologous copies of each gene, thereby reducing the total number of homoeologs in the assembly. the chance of chimeric assembly decreased as the k-mer length associated with the underlying de-bruijn graph was increased, as one might expect. usage of the transcript assembler velvet/oases significantly increased the rate of chimeric assembly to around 60-80%. while this was undesirable, the lack of homoeolog-specificity allowed velvet/oases to produce significantly longer contigs than velvet and abyss . we found that mira, which is not a de-bruijn graph-based assembler, exhibited good homoeolog-specificity  over a wide range of assembly parameters , without significantly compromising contig length , but at the expense of prohibitively increased memory and cpu-time requirements. for comparison, figure  <dig> also shows results obtained with trinity, another short-read de-bruijn graph based assembler developed more recently . homoelog-specificity  obtained with this assembler is somewhat better than that obtained with velvet/oases, but considerably worse than that obtained with mira, with evidence for chimeric assemblies in around 50% of cases. coverage is reduced somewhat  compared to velvet/oases, presumably reflecting the greater homoelog-specificity.

sequence assembly
in view of the results shown in figure  <dig>  a two-step assembly procedure using velvet/oases and mira was employed. initially, a total of  <dig> , <dig> illumina and gs flx reads were assembled with velvet/oases as described in methods. this assembly resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs, with an average length of  <dig> bases. using the number of genes in rice  as a guide, and taking the polyploidy of wheat into account, it is to be expected that the total number of wheat genes significantly exceeds this number of contigs. this supports the conclusion reached during assembly testing against the om set that the velvet/oases assembler is largely homoeolog insensitive. definitive conclusions, however, are difficult to draw because not all genes would have been expressed in the samples that were sequenced , while alternate splice-forms would tend to separate in the assembly .

in order to produce clean homoeolog-specific contigs, the velvet/oases contigs were subsequently used purely to cluster the initial reads, as described in methods, and then discarded. importantly, as we wanted to avoid individual  homoeologs ending up in separate clusters at this early stage, we also included a lenient clustering of the velvet/oases contigs in this step. 78% of reads could be clustered in this way, with the largest cluster containing  <dig>  gs flx and  <dig> , <dig> illumina reads. the largest  <dig>  clusters contained just over 95% of the total number of reads . in each cluster, the number of gs flx reads amounted to, with large fluctuations, 15-20% of the total number of reads in that cluster.

next, each read cluster was assembled separately using mira implemented on a compute cloud, as described in methods. after filtering for quality  and contig length ,  <dig>  contigs were left in the assembly. their cumulative size distribution is shown in figure 2b, with  <dig>  contigs larger than one thousand bases and the longest contig being  <dig>  bases. for comparison, the cumulative size distribution of rice cdnas is also shown . as can be seen, while the cumulative distributions are of similar shape, in general the assembled wheat contigs are shorter than the rice cdnas. while longer contigs could presumably be obtained by reducing assembly stringency, this would in general reduce contig accuracy and, in particular, homoeolog specificity.

sequences were annotated through comparison to rice cdnas, and assigned to map locations when available, as described in methods. in this way, almost 78% of sequences could be annotated through the rice cdnas, while  <dig>  sequences  could not be identified.

sequence coverage
characteristics of transcriptome coverage provided by the assembly were estimated by comparison to a set of  <dig>  full length cdna clones  as well as the harvard tentative contigs  that are themselves assembled from ests in public databases. while it is difficult to be certain about the level of homoeolog-specificity in the tcs, the assembly algorithm that generated them  makes it likely that they are dominated by the most abundantly expressed homoeologs. ests originating from homoeologs with lower expression are likely to be frequently mistaken as sequencing errors of the more abundant member of the homoeologous group.

in figure  <dig>  we show the average coverage along the length of the fls and tcs as a function of the minimum%-identity demanded for a match . the coverage is fairly uniform, only dropping off significantly in the first 20% and in the last 5% of the length of the fls. the distributions for the tcs are more symmetrical than for the fls as the former’s orientation is, in general, not fixed. the average coverage of the fls drops by a factor of around  <dig>   when moving from low specificity  to high specificity . as discussed below, we expect a %id of 90% or less to be largely homoeolog-insensitive, while a %id of 99% or more likely to be homoeolog-discriminating. the drop by a factor of around two or three is, therefore, consistent with the assembly being a homoeolog-discriminating assembly of a  hexaploid.

 <dig>  of  <dig>   fls were matched by at least one assembled contig at 90% identity. this reduced to  <dig>   at 99% identity. for  <dig>  and  <dig> of these, respectively, the alignment extended for more than 80% of the length of the fl sequence. for the tcs,  <dig>  out of  <dig>   were matched by a least one assembled contig at 90% identity and  <dig>   at 99% identity. we note, however, that at 99% id the results have a strong dependence on the %id . we comment on the implications of this in the discussion.

homoeolog specificity
the quality of the final assembly was investigated by again comparing the results to the  <dig> validated bread wheat  homoeologous sequence triplets of the om set, as described earlier. the sequence diversity of the om sequences is shown in figure 4a. an all-vs-all blastn comparison was used to quantify this diversity, with hits with an e-value better than 10- <dig> and an alignment length larger than  <dig> bases being retained. as can be seen, homoeologs in the om set predominantly exhibit a %id of between  <dig> and 99%.

the sequence diversity of our own assembly was quantified in the same way and is shown in figure 4b. this plot is normalized in such a way that at most one hit per sequence pair, with the greatest sequence similarity, is retained. a sharp rise in sequence-pairs with %id above 93% may again be observed and it is tempting to conclude, by comparing to figure 4a, that this peak above background is largely caused by the presence of homoeologous sequences. if this is indeed the case, one would deduce from figure 4b that the average sequence identity of homoeologs in wheat is about  <dig> %, with a spread  of about  <dig> %. this in turn corresponds to a snp frequency per sequence of ~ <dig> %, which is a little higher  than that reported by mochida et al.  <cit> . furthermore, under the extreme assumption that the excess above background seen in figure 4b  is entirely due to homoeologous sequence triplets, one ends up with a lower bound of around  <dig>  ×  <dig> transcripts in the dataset. because in reality one would expect the rna sample to consist of a mixture of expressed homoeologous triplets, doublets and single sequences, this lower bound, being 68% ×  <dig> of the gene content in rice, is not unreasonable.

next, the assembled sequences were compared to the om set using blastn . sequences were allocated to individual homoeologs, using %id as a criterion, by iteratively identifying and removing highest quality matches, as before . results of this comparison are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  on average, the %id of the identified matches is  <dig> %. the snp frequency between varieties of bread wheat is naturally somewhat variable and dependant on cultivar and lineage, with published estimates ranging from  <dig> snp/ <dig> bases  <cit>  to  <dig> snp/ <dig> bases  <cit> . it appears likely, therefore, that the  <dig> snp/ <dig> bases observed between the assembled kukri sequences and the om set  can largely be attributed to inter-cultivar polymorphisms.

in total, this procedure identified  <dig> out of a total of  <dig>  possible homoeologs in the om set. for  <dig> triplets all three homoeologs were identified , for  <dig> triplets two out of three homoeologs were identified  and in one case only one member of the triplet was identified.

the level of chimeric assembly between reads originating from separate homoeologs was quantified in the final assembly, as described earlier. in total, only  <dig> out of  <dig>  assigned sequences showed some evidence of chimeric assembly.

these results are almost identical to those shown for the assemblies produced by mira and shown in figure  <dig>  which did not involve an initial velvet/oasis assembly. this is consistent with the interpretation that the two-stage assembly was not compromised by mis-assembly in stage one.

finally, a set of  <dig> random clusters was selected from the final assembly in such a way that  <dig> contigs therein were mutually overlapping. these contigs were then compared to unassembled reads from a genomic wheat sequencing project of the variety chinese spring . the existence of any reads that could clearly be associated with more than  <dig> contig was taken as evidence of chimeric assembly. in total,  <dig> suspect contigs were identified in this way, leading to an independent estimate of the rate of chimeric assembly of about 18%. this is in rather good agreement with the estimate provided by the comparison to the om set described earlier.

comparison to other grass genomes
the assembled wheat sequences were compared to those available for the published genomes of rice  <cit> , sorghum  <cit>  and brachypodium  <cit>  . just under 80% of the wheat contigs have an apparent homologue in one of these diploids . in most cases  a homologue was identified in all three species and, quite reasonably given the relative proximity of brachypodium to wheat in the phylogenetic tree, more homologues were identified in brachypodium than in the other two species. we do not believe that all of the 20% of wheat sequences that did not have a match in the other species are unique to wheat; rather, closer inspection reveals that these sequences tend to be those contigs that are shorter than average, and so we think that inadequate sequence length prevented a reasonable match from being identified. this interpretation is supported by the fact that, if only contigs longer than  <dig> bases are retained in figure  <dig>  the proportion of unmatched sequences reduces dramatically to around  <dig> %.

in most cases, several wheat sequences are associated with each brachypodium, rice and sorghum sequence in figure  <dig> simply because of the polyploid nature of the wheat genome and so this figure does not in itself provide information about the proportion of sequences in brachypodium, rice and sorghum that are represented in wheat. inspection of the sequence comparison results  shows that  <dig> % of brachypodium sequences,  <dig> % of sorghum sequences and  <dig> % of rice sequences are matched by at least one wheat contig. these numbers lend support to the estimates of coverage resulting from the comparison to the fl and tc wheat datasets earlier on.

finally, the wheat contigs were compared against  <dig>  published sequences of full length barley cdnas  <cit> .  <dig>  wheat sequences  were represented in the barley full length cdnas and  <dig>  barley sequences  were found to have at least one wheat homologue. one would expect the number of wheat sequences represented in the full length cdnas to be lower than that for rice, brachypodium and sorghum simply because the barley cdna dataset  <cit>  does not correspond to the full barley genome. this appears to be the case, however the comparison to barley sequences was performed on the dna level, while the comparison to the other three genomes was performed on the peptide level, so an accurate quantitative comparison of numbers is not possible.

gene ontology analysis and pfam domains
the wheat contigs were classified into the gene ontology hierarchy  <cit>  by transferring the go terms of the best sequence match in rice to each matched wheat sequence, as described in methods. in this way,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  wheat contigs inherited  <dig>  go terms. this compares to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  rice loci annotated with  <dig>  go terms.

the results of this go analysis for the “molecular function” ontology are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  it is noticeable that go categories associated with binding to rna , chromatin binding  and translation factor activity  appear greatly enriched in wheat compared to rice. it is tempting to speculate that all three categories are enriched in wheat because of its enormous number of transposable elements  <cit> . this may require an increased need for rna silencing and/or translational inhibition  <cit> .

the wheat contigs were also scrutinized for occurrences of pfam domains . in total,  <dig>  contigs were found to contain  <dig>  unique domains. for comparison, the rice coding sequences  <cit>  contained  <dig>  sequences with  <dig>  unique domains.  <dig>  of these domains are in common between the two species. generally speaking, the number of occurrences of any particular pfam domain is strongly correlated in wheat and rice , indicating that there is no strong evidence of genome wide functional bias associated with the assembly procedure. some notable exceptions to this are shown in additional file 5: table s <dig>  corresponding to off-diagonal points in additional file 4: figure s <dig> with domains associated with transposable elements  being particularly over-represented in wheat, in line with the expectation outlined above  <cit> .

homologous cluster analysis
orthomcl  <cit>  was used to cluster wheat contigs into  <dig>  putative homologous groups together with the peptide sequences of the three sequenced genomes of brachypodium, rice and sorghum, as described in methods. as shown in figure  <dig>  the three diploid species contribute, on average, around 11% of the sequences of each group, while wheat contributes the remaining 2/ <dig> 

groups with an abnormally low number of wheat sequences  include one annotated as subtilisin  and a group of  <dig> cytochrome p450s, while groups with an abnormally large number of wheat sequences  include a group of  <dig> alanyl-trna synthetates and  <dig> splicing factors, broadly consistent with the over-representation of translation and rna binding related activities indicated in additional file 6: table s <dig> 

discussion
creating a clean assembly of a polyploid transcriptome, where homoeologs have a very high sequence identity, challenges most sequence assembly algorithms. of the algorithms examined, the overlap-consensus based mira algorithm  <cit>  was found to give the best results and by a significant margin . we presume this is due to the multi-pass algorithm implemented in mira, which generates a sequence of assemblies, with each iteration learning about possible mis-assemblies from the previous one. sequence quality estimates, and even platform-dependence of likely sequencing errors, are taken into account by this assembler when making decisions as to which nucleotide changes to interpret as being indicative of a related transcript and which ones to ignore as being likely results of sequencing errors. the whole approach used by mira is rather similar, in principle, to the way one might painstakingly construct an assembly by hand.

in this it is rather different to the approach used by short-read assemblers such as velvet, abyss and trinity. these assemblers are primarily designed to be able to cope with huge read numbers, far exceeding anything that mira can deal with. they do this through the use of de-bruijn graphs constructed from k-mers that are typically shorter than the distance between informative snps on the wheat homoeologs. evidence of multiple homoeologous transcripts is therefore largely determined in a subsequent disentangling of these complex graphs and information about sequence quality is usually ignored in the interests of speed. while this is clearly a valid and highly successful approach, the evidence presented in figure  <dig> indicates that it is presently not able to achieve the high precision required to disentangle the wheat homoeologs.

mira’s careful approach comes at a high cost in terms of computing memory and time, and made it impractical for us to use the algorithm for a direct assembly of the wheat transcriptome. this was the reason for using the two-step assembly. with ongoing algorithmic improvements to the mira assembly algorithm underway, it is hoped that at some stage in the future this somewhat circuitous approach will no longer be necessary. in the meantime, our two-step procedure was sufficiently successful for it to be used for de-novo transcriptome assembly of other complex polyploid organisms, and perhaps for metagenomic samples.

while the two-step approach was developed primarily to deal with the polyploidy of wheat it may have other benefits as well. in particular, as opposed to bacterial or vertebrate genomes that de bruijn-graph based techniques have been developed for, plant genomes are generally more difficult to assemble because of the greatly increased presence of large gene families. on the other hand it is widely believed that alternate splicing plays less of a role in plants than in animals  <cit> , although this gap is narrowing as knowledge of plant genomics improves  <cit> . one might expect, therefore, that standard short read assemblers developed for microbial/animal genomes may encounter analogous difficulties to the ones discussed here, albeit on a smaller scale, simply because of this increased preponderance of highly similar sequences in plants.

in general, one can estimate that gene duplications predating the evolution of the last common ancestor of the a, b and d genomes of wheat around 5– <dig> million years ago should exhibit greater sequence divergence than that shown between homoeologs of the same gene, and should therefore be amenable to correct assembly using the parameters that were used here. conversely, very recent gene duplications  may very well confound proper assembly of even diploid plant genomes, regardless of parameters or the assembly algorithm that is used. generally speaking, no assembly algorithm will be able to distinguish sequences where the average distance between mutations significantly exceeds the effective read length. in this case only increased read length, or construction of libraries with larger insert sizes sequenced as mate-pairs, will lead to increased resolution of related genes. given that the results presented here indicate that the average distance between snps/indels distinguishing wheat homoeologs is around  <dig> bases, while the effective read length is around 300– <dig> bases, it is expected that this assembly should typically distinguish gene sequences that arose out of duplication events that are considerably more recent than the polyploidization event characterized by the above time scale.

having performed the assembly, assessing its characteristics was not straightforward. we were greatly aided by the availability of an est-based set of validated homoeologous sequence triplets  <cit> . this comparison indicated that differentiation of individual homoeologs in the assembly was excellent, with over 95% of homoeologs represented by an assembled contig. on a cautionary note, however, this validated set is not overly large and there is a danger of possible bias as est collections tend to be dominated by the most abundantly expressed transcripts. in other words, it is possible that homoeologous sequence triplets with highly asymmetric expression between the homoeologs – and these ones are the hardest to assemble with confidence – are underrepresented in the om dataset. it may be, therefore, that the true homoeolog specificity of the assembly is somewhat less than the estimation based on the om sequence set.

similarly, the comparison to the om set is only likely to be an approximate indication of the percentage of the total transcriptome covered by the assembly . as shown in the results section, comparison to the fls and tcs indicates that the true number is more likely to be around 75-80%, dropping somewhat  when homoeolog specificity is taken into account. the latter estimate, however, is rather uncertain due to confounding factors, such as residual sequence error as well as variety-specific sequence differences. the lower limit on the number of homoeologous triplets deduced from figure  <dig> indicates that the true figure for homoeologous-specific coverage is likely to be towards the upper end of this estimate. it is our expectation that the main reason for the 20-25% reduction from a total coverage of the transcriptome is the fact that not all possible tissues, developmental stages, environmental conditions and stress responses were probed, i.e. not all genes were expressed in our samples. other factors associated with transcriptome sequencing, such as fluctuations in expression levels insufficiently attenuated through the normalization procedure, or limited number of reads for transcripts expressed at very low levels, may also have had an effect on the final coverage that was achieved.

broadly speaking, these estimates of coverage are in line with the results obtained when comparing the wheat contigs with available sequences from the rice, sorghum, brachypodium and barley genomes. 70-90% of genes in each of these genomes were found to have a representative in the wheat assembly. brachypodium, which is the closest relative to wheat among these grasses, has a genome presently estimated to contain just over  <dig>  genes. together, this leads to an estimate that the wheat transcript assembly corresponds to at most ~ <dig> - <dig>  homoeologs . with a total number of wheat transcripts of  <dig>  this in turn implies that our assembly contains  <dig> - <dig>  transcripts/homoeolog. this estimate is quantitatively consistent both with difference in cumulative sequence length distributions of wheat and rice shown in figure 2b as well as the relative contribution that the wheat sequences make, on average, to the sequence content of the homologous groups of the grass genomes shown in figure  <dig>  an assembly with parameters that are less stringent than the ones used here would decrease the number of transcripts per homoeolog, but would also increase the mis-assembly of homoeologs.

finally, the sequence resource provided here makes it appropriate to carry out similar projects on additional varieties for snp discovery and genotyping purposes. we are in the process of sequencing the transcriptome of an additional five elite bread wheat lines, results of which will be presented elsewhere. furthermore, the transcript sequences provided by this work should prove of great use to the annotation of genome-sequencing projects in that they provide valuable information on identifying those parts of the genome that are actually expressed.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used next-generation sequencing combined with an effective parallelization of the sequence assembly process that permits the generation of a high-quality, homoeolog-specific, assembly of the transcriptome of a polyploid species. while the work provides a methodology that can be used for other organisms and/or metagenomic or metatranscriptomic samples, the main outcome is that it makes available, for the first time, a comprehensive compendium of the homoeologous gene sequences of bread wheat. we have deposited these sequences, as well as the raw data used in this study, at ncbi under project number bioproject id prjna <dig>  the transcript set is also available from the authors on request.
