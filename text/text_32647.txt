BACKGROUND
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common monogenic disorder characterized by the formation of epithelial cysts in the kidney, liver and pancreas. the disease is due to mutations in two genes: the pkd <dig> and the pkd <dig> genes, mutated in  <dig> and 15% of cases respectively, which encode for polycystin- <dig>  and polycystin- <dig> . pc- <dig> is a large protein composed by a relatively short intracellular c-terminus ,  <dig> trans-membrane domains that ensure its localization at er and cytoplasmic membrane, and a long extracellular n-terminus   <cit> . the c-terminal tail likely mediates a series of signaling pathways  <cit> , while the large n-terminal region contains a number of domains possibly involved in mediating protein-protein interaction and/or in sensing mechanical stimuli  <cit> . the protein localizes at cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts as well as at the primary cilium  <cit> ; here, pc- <dig> is proposed to directly sense urine flow  <cit>  and possibly mediate activation of its partner pc- <dig>  which is a calcium channel of the trpp family, although this model has been recently challenged  <cit> . consistently with the localization at cell-cell junctions it has been shown that polycystin- <dig> is involved in cell-cell adhesion dynamics  <cit> . finally, at the cell-matrix interface pc- <dig> has been proposed to play a role in cell-substrate adhesion  <cit>  and the short intracellular c-tail of pc- <dig> has been previously localized into focal adhesions   <cit> . however, the ability of pc- <dig> to mediate and control cell adhesion to the substrate has never been investigated in detail, although its role in this context has been one of the first functions proposed for this receptor, and suggested to play a role in adpkd phenotype  <cit> .

the capability of cells to adhere to the substrate is fundamental for many cell biological processes, including key aspects during embryonic development. cell adhesion to extracellular matrix is a highly dynamic and tightly regulated process  <cit> . at the front edge of a migrating cell the formation and maturation of multi-protein focal adhesions provide the basis for setting the tension to propel the cell forward. at the cell rear, instead, the disassembly of the fas mediated by a microtubule-guided process allows free cell movement. each of these steps is regulated by several proteins, although details of the mechanisms remain elusive. among all, focal adhesion kinase  is an important player in these processes  <cit> : fak−/− fibroblasts display defective cell migration and an accumulation of immature focal contacts  <cit> . indeed, fak directly interacts with adhesion components such as integrins, and phosphorylates paxillin, a fundamental component of focal complexes  <cit> ; overexpression of a mutated form of paxillin which cannot be phosphorylated by fak prevents the turnover of focal contacts and cell motility  <cit> .

interestingly, several studies in the past from our and other groups have implicated a role for pc- <dig> in regulation of different aspects of the migratory process  <cit> . indeed polycystin- <dig> induces actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and protrusion at the cell edge in wound healing assays, and it also favors the dynamic of cell-cell adhesion, promoting β-catenin turnover  <cit>  in epithelial cells. a dual role for polycystin- <dig> in regulation of cell migration has been proposed: pc- <dig> is able to regulate both the rate of cell movement as well as the orientation of cells during migration  <cit> .

here we report a series of novel observations on the role of pc- <dig> in cell migration. we report that pc- <dig> is able to regulate the microtubule stability and dynamics in addition to the actin cytoskeleton. furthermore, we report that the capability of pc- <dig> to influence the microtubule cytoskeleton results in a dynamic regulation of focal adhesion formation and in an enhanced adhesion to the substrate. interestingly, we show that all these effects of pc- <dig> depend on the activity of fak and are important for regulation of cell migratory rates. of interest, we show that the actin cytoskeleton is not essential in pc- <dig> mediated cell orientation during migration, a process in which the dynamic regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton is instead essential.

RESULTS
polycystin- <dig> regulates microtubule stability
we have previously reported that polycystin- <dig> regulates both the rates of cell migration and front-rear polarity of migrating cells in mdck epithelial cells and in fibroblasts  <cit> . actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are directly involved in extending new protrusions in the direction of migration and in generating the propelling force for cell movement. pc- <dig> overexpression has been reported to induce actin protrusion  <cit> . therefore, we carefully analyzed actin filaments and microtubules by immunofluorescence staining using phalloidin and an anti-α-tubulin antibody in cellular models of gain or loss-of-function of pc- <dig>  <cit> . we analyzed cells in wound-healing assays, in which a migration stimulus is generated by scratching the cell monolayer with a pipette tip. 1 hour after wounding, when the migration involves mainly the first row of cells facing the wound, a set of previously described mdck cells carrying over-expression of pc- <dig>   <cit>  reveals the presence of actin protrusions and elongated microtubules, while control mdck cells  have a strong actin staining at the cell-cell junctions and randomly oriented microtubules . conversely, fibroblasts carrying null alleles of the pkd <dig> gene   <cit>  display defective actin and microtubule organizations compared to pkd1+/+ control cells . to test if the absence of pc- <dig> is linked with defective actin and microtubular protrusions in the setting of epithelial cells, we generated a set of mimcd cells carrying stable silencing of the pkd <dig> gene, generating mimcdshpkd <dig> clones carrying a  <dig> to 70% downregulation of pc- <dig>  as compared to parental mimcd cells or controls infected with a scrambled shrna  . wound healing assays followed by immunofluorescence revealed that mimcdshctrl cells tend to have more actin and microtubule-based protrusions at the leading edge as compared to mimcdshpkd <dig> cells .figure  <dig> polycystin- <dig> levels correlate with cytoskeleton protrusions formation in wound-healing assay and microtubules stabilization.  mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo  cells were subjected to wound healing, allowed to migrate for one hour and stained with α-tubulin antibodies , fitc-phalloidin  and dapi staining . full images and zoom-in of the boxed areas show that mdckpkd1zeo cells have both actin filaments and microtubules elongated towards the wound. bar: 20 μm.  western blot analysis of pc- <dig> levels using lrr antibody in fibroblasts pkd1

since microtubule elongation in oriented cell migration correlates with the presence of persistent microtubules, we hypothesized that pc- <dig> can influence the rate of microtubule stabilization. to formally test this hypothesis we performed nocodazole resistance assays, which consist in treating living cells with nocodazole  for a short period of time, to depolymerize only the newly formed microtubules, followed by fixation and tubulin immunostaining. quantification revealed that mdckpkd1zeo cells have increased resistance to nocodazole, when compared to control clones . in line with this, we found that pkd1−/− fibroblasts, show decreased stabilization of the cytoskeleton, as compared to wild-type controls . we conclude from these studies that pc- <dig> regulates the microtubules in addition to the microfilaments.

both the microtubule and the actin cytoskeletons are involved in pkd1-dependent cell migration
we next aimed at dissecting the relative role of the two cytoskeleton components  in pc-1-mediated cell migration. to this end, we used two different assays: boyden chambers assay to assess cell motility and evaluation of golgi re-orientation in wound-healing assay to quantify cell orientation during migration. importantly, in line with our published data, the newly generated mimcdshpkd <dig> cells display both impairment of cell migration in boyden chambers  and in front-rear polarity . treatment in the presence of cytochalasind  and latrunculina , both able to interfere with the actin cytoskeleton, hindered pkd1-dependent cell migration in boyden chamber assays in mdckpkd1zeo cells and in pkd1+/+ fibroblasts, reducing their motility capabilities down to the levels of mdckzeo controls and pkd1−/− fibroblasts . on the contrary, neither of the two toxins had effects on the establishment of front-rear polarity . staining of the actin cytoskeleton revealed that both drugs are however able to disrupt the actin filaments, excluding the possibility that the drugs did not effectively act on the actin cytoskeleton . in previous studies we have shown that the rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton observed upon over-expression of pc- <dig> are mediated by the pi- <dig> kinase cascade. in line with these previous data, we found that the pi- <dig> kinase inhibitors ly <dig>  and wortmannin  are able to inhibit cell migration in boyden chamber assays, but had no effect on front-rear polarity establishment , similarly to the actin depolymerizing drugs.figure  <dig> polycystin-1-dependent migration depends on both actin and microtubules, while front-rear polarity only on microtubules.  boyden chambers on mimcd cells, showed that silencing of pkd <dig>  decreases their migration capability, as compared to controls .  golgi orientation in wound-healing assays on mimcd cells, showed front-rear polarity impairment upon pkd <dig> silencing.  boyden chambers assay performed on mdck cells  and fibroblasts  in the presence of cytochalasind  or latrunculina , revealed the essential role of actin in migration. graphs are representative of three independent experiments; averages and sd are shown.  mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo  were wounded in the presence of cytochalasind  or latrunculina  and after  <dig> h stained with phalloidin , anti-giantin  and dapi . bar:  <dig> μm.  quantification of golgi repositioning revealed no effect of cytochalasind  or latrunculina  on front-rear polarity in mdckpkd1zeo cells . graphs are representative of three independent experiments; averages and sd are shown.  boyden chamber assays performed in the presence of nocodazole  or taxol  revealed the role of microtubules in migration. graph is representative of three independent experiments; averages and sd are shown.  quantification of golgi repositioning revealed a strong effect of nocodazole and taxol on front-rear polarity in mdckpkd1zeo epithelial cells  and in pkd1

next, we used nocodazole which is able to interfere with the nascent microtubules when used at nanomolar concentrations , as well as taxol , which instead prevents disassembly of the already polymerized tubulin filaments. both these drugs were able to strongly interfere with the capability of cells to move across the membrane in boyden chamber assays  and to achieve front-rear polarity . we conclude that pc- <dig> regulates both the actin and the microtubules cytoskeletons, but while pc- <dig> mediated cell motility depends on both the actin and the microtubular cytoskeleton, pc-1-induced front-rear polarity exclusively depends on the latter.

polycystin- <dig> regulates cell adhesion and nascent focal adhesions
during the course of our experiments we noticed that mdckpkd1zeo cells appeared to have a different capability to adhere to the substrate. to formally test if pc- <dig> can indeed modulate the rate of cell adhesion to the substrate, we performed a colorimetric adhesion assay: briefly, 15 minutes after plating, cells are washed with fresh medium so that all non-adherent cells are removed, while cells that have adhered are fixed, colored and counted. we found that compared to control mdckzeo clones, a higher proportion of mdckpkd1zeo cells still adhere to the plate after the washout . colorimetric quantification showed that adhesion is significantly higher in mdckpkd1zeo clones compared to controls . consistently with these data, adhesion assays performed on fibroblasts uncovered that pkd1−/− and mimcdshpkd <dig> cells have a reduced capability to adhere to the substrate, compared to their respective controls . the difference in adhesiveness is no longer statistically significant only 3 hours after plating in mefs, while 6 hours after plating in mdck and mimcd cells , indicating that pc- <dig> controls the early steps of cell adhesion. of interest, interfering with the actin cytoskeleton abolished pc- <dig> effects on adhesion .figure  <dig> polycystin- <dig> regulates cell adhesion to the substrate.  images of the colorimetric adhesion assay of mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo  cells upon wash-out. as control, images of unwashed cells are shown.  experiments as in a are quantified by measuring absorbance  of colored cells revealing that mdckpkd1zeo cells adhere more to fibronectin. the graph is representative of four independent experiments; averages and sd are shown. statistical analysis: anova; *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , relative to both control clones .  time course of a colorimetric adhesion assay with: mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo  cells , pkd1

we next asked if the difference in adhesiveness is indeed due to a different capability to assemble focal adhesions. to test this, we analyzed by immunofluorescence cells at early time points after plating , when they are initially spreading on fibronectin matrix. in control mdck cells, paxillin localizes mainly at the cell periphery and only forms relatively small clusters, very distant from one another. on the contrary, mdckpkd1zeo cells form many more focal adhesions at the cell periphery, as well as some clusters in the body . in both cell lines, focal adhesions indeed localize on the basal side of the cell, mediating the contact with the extracellular matrix as expected .

these data define a role for polycystin- <dig> in regulating focal adhesions during the first phases of cell adhesion, explaining the capability to modulate adhesion to the substrate.

polycystin- <dig> regulates focal adhesions during cell migration
we next investigated the role of pc- <dig> on focal adhesion distribution during cell migration. first, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of mdck clones migrating as single cells, 5 hours after plating on fibronectin. control mdckzeo cells show a round non-polarized shape with large focal adhesions mostly localized at the peripheral actin bundles . on the contrary, mdckpkd1zeo clones acquire a polarized shape and have a higher number of focal adhesions of different sizes: the larger focal adhesions are present in the central-rear part of the cell body, while the smaller ones are localized at the actin protrusions of the front edge . the same difference in paxillin pattern between control and pkd <dig> overexpressing cells is also visible at later time points of migration . this effect is not correlated with gross clustering differences of focal adhesions, that appear to be correctly formed at the very basal site of the cell in all the clones . consistently with these observations in mdck cells, pkd1−/− fibroblasts have predominantly bigger focal adhesions randomly localized, while in wild-type fibroblast paxillin staining reflects the single cell migration pattern .figure  <dig> polycystin- <dig> modulates focal adhesions distribution during migration.  immunofluorescence images of mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo  cells plated for 5 h on fibronectin. cells were stained for actin , paxillin  and nucleus . mdckzeo cells have a round shape and peripheral clusters of paxillin; mdckpkd1zeo cells acquire a polarized and migratory phenotype, with focal adhesions of different dimensions. bar: 25 μm.  confocal images of immunofluorescence on mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo , plated overnight on fibronectin. cells were stained for actin , paxillin  and nucleus . images represent one confocal z-section of the cell, on the right and below each image are projections along x and y axis, reconstructed with volocity software. in all cell lines, paxillin staining is found on the ventral side and localizes in clusters . mdckpkd1zeo cells maintain a polarized morphology and present numerous focal adhesions, while mdckzeo cells have a round shape and a limited number of paxillin clusters, mainly localized at the periphery of the cell. bar: 15 μm.  representative confocal images of mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo  cells , and of mimcdshctrl  and mimcdshpkd <dig>  cells , allowed to migrate in a 3 hours wound-healing assay on fibronectin and subsequently stained for actin , paxillin  and nucleus . merged images, single channels and zoom-in of the boxed areas of paxillin are shown. bar: 25 μm.



next, we analyzed focal adhesions distribution during collective cell migration, in wound healing assays  <cit> . after 3 hours from wounding, mdck control clones present a low number of small focal adhesions, localized near the cell edge but not directly at the tips ; on the contrary, in mdckpkd1zeo paxillin staining localizes at the very end of the actin protrusion tips . consistently, focal adhesions at the leading edge of control mimcdshctrl cells are oriented in the direction of the wound, while pkd <dig> silenced mimcdshpkd <dig> cells show large focal adhesions parallel to the wound . from these data we conclude that during the process of single cell and collective migration pc- <dig> is involved in regulating focal adhesion distribution.

polycystin- <dig> regulates focal adhesions turnover
the data above suggest that pc- <dig> may increase the dynamic of focal adhesion formation.

to test this hypothesis we first analyzed focal adhesion disassembly with nocodazole washout assays  <cit> . briefly, nocodazole  is added to the medium of serum-starved cells to completely depolymerize microtubules, and then washed out with fresh serum-starvation medium to allow microtubule regrowth; as microtubules start to target focal adhesion these are disassembled. the staining of paxillin and the related quantification showed that in mdckpkd1zeo cells the majority of focal adhesions are disassembled 15 minutes after nocodazole washout; on the contrary, controls do not lose focal adhesion structures in these conditions . this difference is not secondary to a difference in microtubule depolymerization: indeed, in both clones, microtubules are completely depolymerized by nocodazole treatment and start to reform with the same timing, 15 minutes after nocodazole washout ; focal adhesions are completely reformed 2 hours later . next, we looked at the loss-of-function cellular systems. similar analysis in mefs revealed that pkd1−/− cells maintain their paxillin staining 15 minutes after nocodazole washout, while pkd+/+ cells have lost their focal adhesion structures .figure  <dig> polycystin- <dig> regulates focal adhesion dynamics.  quantification of focal adhesion disassembly in mdckzeo  and mdckpkd1zeo  cells , and in pkd1

−/− fibroblasts, were transfected with gfp-paxillin. gfp-paxillin-positive adhesions were subjected to frap analysis. the panel  show images of whole cells  and zoom-in of the individual focal adhesions  at crucial time points: pre-bleaching time , at bleaching completed time , post-bleaching corresponding at about t1/ <dig> recovery times of the different cell lines , and at long time point . bleached focal adhesions are indicated with arrows in the first image and asterisks in the higher magnification images. the results showing the half time  of fluorescence recovery are reported in the box plots ; average values are indicated above each box. statistical analysis: t-test, ****p <  <dig> . f <dig>  n = 22;  <dig>  n =  <dig>  pkd1

to more precisely assess if pc- <dig> presence or absence correlates with the rate of focal adhesions turnover, we tested the time required for a full turnover of paxillin using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  on a transfected gfp-tagged paxillin molecule  <cit>  . the mean half-time of fluorescence recovery  in the bleached area was determined as an estimate stability of adhesion binding. mdckpkd1zeo cells exhibited a significantly faster recovery of gfp-paxillin compared to control mdckzeo cells . consistently, the opposite was observed in pkd1−/− fibroblasts as compared to pkd1+/+ .

these data demonstrate that polycystin- <dig> positively regulates focal adhesion disassembly in the experimental conditions used and suggest that the capability of pc- <dig> to regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton stability is likely involved in regulation of the turnover of focal adhesions, ultimately mediating cell adhesion and migration.

focal adhesion kinase is important for pkd1-dependent cell migration and adhesion
a fundamental effector of focal adhesion signaling is focal adhesion kinase , whose activity is marked by its phosphorylation in tyr <dig>  <cit> . we analyzed the activity of focal adhesion kinase in our cellular models. we first considered single cell migration conditions, and lysed cells plated overnight at low cell density . in line with the effects on focal adhesions described above, western blot analysis showed that mdckpkd1zeo have higher levels of tyr397-phosphorylated fak compared to control cells and that subconfluent pkd1−/− cells have lower phosphorylation levels of fak than pkd1+/+ .figure  <dig> polycystin- <dig> induces focal adhesion kinase  activation, important for cell adhesion, migration and front-rear polarity.  western blot analysis in mdck cells  and fibroblasts , after overnight plating at 50% confluence reveals higher phosphorylation, i.e. activation, of fak in mdckpkd1zeo cells compared to mdckzeo, and lower in pkd1
−/− compared to pkd1
+/+ fibroblasts.  western blot analysis as in a of cells collected at different time points after wounding  or after plating .  colorimetric adhesion assay performed in the presence of the fak inhibitor pf- <dig>  revealed a significant decrease in adhesion of both pkd1

+/+ and mdckpkd1zeo cells. averages and sd are shown. statistical analysis: anova; ns  p >  <dig> , *p <  <dig> .  golgi orientation in wound-healing assays in the presence of pf- <dig>  show a significant decrease in front-rear polarity of pkd1
+/+ fibroblasts and mdckpkd1zeo cells. averages and sd are shown. statistical analysis: anova; ns  p >  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ****p <  <dig> .  pf- <dig>  significantly decreases focal adhesion disassembly in mdckpkd1zeo cells evaluated by nocodazole washout experiments. the graph is representative of three independent experiments. averages and sd are shown. statistical analysis: anova; ns  p >  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , referred to the relative control  bar.  western blot analysis reveals that pf- <dig>  inhibits phosphorylation of the pi3kinase target akt, while wortmannin  does not affect fak phosphorylation.



we also tested fak phosphorylation levels in conditions of collective cell migration, analyzing confluent cells in response to wound. also in these conditions, mdckpkd1zeo cells have enhanced phospho-fak levels as compared to controls, which is visible prior to challenging with the wound and is maintained upon wounding at all the time points analyzed . these results show that in different migration conditions, polycystin- <dig> expression correlates with higher activation of fak.

next, to assess if differences in fak phosphorylation can also be observed in the initial phases of cell adhesion, we serum-starved cells and plated them on fibronectin and collected them at different time points. mdckzeo control cells show a small increase of fak phosphorylation after plating. however, mdckpkd1zeo cells display a much higher activation rate of fak in all the time points considered . these data are consistent with the increased rates of adhesion of these cells.

to test if fak activity is necessary for mdckpkd1zeo cell adhesion, we performed adhesion assays in the presence of a specific kinase inhibitor   <cit> . the inhibitor decreases adhesion of both mdckpkd1zeo clones and pkd1+/+ fibroblasts , suggesting that early adhesion to fibronectin mediated by pc- <dig> depends on this kinase. importantly, pf- <dig> also had a profound effect on the capability of cells to migrate  and to achieve front-rear polarity in wound healing assays . next, we tested if fak inhibition also impairs pc- <dig> dependent increase in focal adhesion disassembly. indeed, nocodazole washout assays performed in the presence of pf- <dig> inhibitor revealed that the disassembly of focal adhesion in mdckpkd1zeo cells is sensitive to this drug . interestingly, pi- <dig> kinase does not seem to mediate the regulation of fak phosphorylation in these conditions, as the pi- <dig> kinase inhibitor wortmannin does not revert pc- <dig> induced upregulation of fak .

discussion
previous studies from our and other groups have implicated pc- <dig> in mediating cell migration and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> .

we have previously shown that pc-  <dig> is able to regulate two distinct aspects of cell migration: cell polarity  and cell motility. pkd <dig> mutants display defective golgi orientation in wound-healing assay and defects in persistent cell migration  <cit> , defining a role for pc- <dig> in front-rear polarity establishment. second, overexpression of the full length pkd <dig> cdna or the only c-terminus of pc- <dig> protein increases cell migration rate in epithelial cells  <cit> , implicating pc- <dig> in cell motility.

in the present study we show that pc- <dig> not only acts by enhancing actin cytoskeleton protrusions  <cit> , but it also regulates both elongation and stabilization of the microtubules. we also discerned the relative involvement of the two cytoskeletal components in pc-1-dependent cell migration, uncovering that cell motility requires both actin and the microtubules, while front-rear polarity depends only on the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton. interestingly, a well documented relationship between the actin and the microtubule cystoskeleton has been described in many different cellular processes, including cell migration  <cit> . during cell migration the actin cytoskeleton pushes the edge of the cell forward and allows for contraction and retraction of the tail. this process intimately depends on the capability of cells to assemble and disassemble focal contacts. the microtubule cytoskeleton plays a key role in this last process by facilitating exocytosis and endocytosis of key adhesion molecules. thus, it is not surprising that we find in this study that the coordination of the two types of cytoskeletons is crucial for pc- <dig> induced migration.

furthermore, we uncover an essential function of pc- <dig> in modulating the adhesive properties of cells to the substrate. this property is linked to pc- <dig> ability to regulate the dynamic formation of fas, although this must be a fine regulation, since cells lacking the pkd <dig> gene do finally form focal adhesions properly. in addition, during the initial phases of cell adhesion, the pc-1-deficient cells display lower focal adhesion number and higher heterogeneity, further suggesting that pc- <dig> regulates focal adhesion dynamics and localization. the role of cell adhesion dynamics in cell migration is well recognized. adhesion to the substrate at the front of the cell generates the tension forces required to propel the cell forward, whereas disassembly of focal adhesions at the cell rear allows retraction of the tail  <cit> . importantly, these properties must be balanced within the cell since a misbalance towards focal adhesions formation and maturation can prevent cell motility, while an excessive disassembly might decrease the proper intracellular tension. in migrating cells, pkd <dig> overexpression increases focal contacts at the cell protrusive edge and the size of focal adhesions in the tail. we further observed that pc- <dig> deficient cells show defective focal adhesions disassembly, which explain the presence of large focal adhesions in these cells. indeed, detailed analysis using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching  in cells transfected with a gfp-paxillin molecule as previously described  <cit> , evidenced that pc- <dig> can influence the rate of focal adhesions turnover. in particular, cells carrying over-expression of pc- <dig> have an enhanced turnover, while cells lacking pc- <dig> have a reduced turnover.

the role of pc- <dig> that we observe in favoring focal adhesion turnover is most likely exerted by focal adhesion kinase  activity. fak is a master regulator of adhesion; in particular, it appears to be involved mostly in focal adhesion dynamic and disassembly, more than in their formation or maturation  <cit> . consistently, fak activation is higher in pkd <dig> overexpressing cells, and is lower in pkd <dig> mutants. furthermore, its inhibition decreases pc-1-dependent focal adhesion disassembly and is able to revert pc- <dig> capability to regulate cell migration acting both on the motility and on front-rear polarity. our data taken together suggest that fak might act quite upstream in pc-1-mediated cell migration. moreover, in line with our previously reported data, while inhibitors of pi- <dig> kinase are able to revert cell motility, but not front-rear polarity, fak inhibitors act at both levels. in addition the pc- <dig> mediated upregulation of the pi- <dig> kinase/akt signaling pathway that we have previously described  <cit>  is inhibited by fak inhibitors, while pi-3kinase inhibitors are unable to revert fak upregulation. these data taken together suggest that fak acts upstream of pi- <dig> kinase/akt in the pc- <dig> regulated pathway, although further studies will be required to better understand the molecular details of this regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have uncovered a previously unrecognized, though hypothesized, role for pc- <dig> in regulating cell adhesion and the dynamics of focal adhesion contacts via its capability to regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton. furthermore, we show that pc- <dig> can modulate the activity of the focal adhesion kinase  to exert its function on cell adhesion and migration.

one important question that rises from our study is in which physiological context this role of pc- <dig> might be important? while additional studies will be necessary to answer this question, here we speculate that this might be relevant during renal development. we have recently shown that during development of the kidney, the morphogenesis of renal tubules is achieved by convergent extension-like movements which are impaired in pkd <dig> mutant tubules  <cit> . we speculate here that the cellular movements required during this process might require that pc- <dig> is able to properly regulate the cytoskeletons and the adhesiveness of cells to the substrate for cells to achieve proper intercalation and eventually convergent extension.
