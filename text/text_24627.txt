BACKGROUND
lignocellulose, consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, is the most abundant and renewable resource that can be hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars to produce biofuel  <cit> . natural cellulose is a linear polymer composed of thousands of glucose molecules linked via β-1-4-glycosidic bonds. it exists in highly ordered, tightly packed microfibrils, forming remarkable hindrance to cellulases  <cit> . conversion of the crystalline regions of native cellulose into amorphous and accessible regions is a critical step, and is a great challenge for efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulose  <cit> .

expansins are a class of plant proteins that can promote the plant cell wall loosening by breaking down the hydrogen bonds among cellulose microfibrils or between cellulose fibers and the polysaccharide matrix  <cit> . swollenin, a newly identified fungal protein with sequence similarity to plant expansins, is capable of weakening filter paper and disrupting the structure of cotton fiber and valonia cell walls  <cit> . the disruptive activity of expansins and swollenin on plant cell walls can enhance the hydrolysis of biomass. while active and efficient heterologous production of expansins outside plants has not been reported, fungal swollenin has successfully achieved recombinant expression in several eukaryotic  <cit>  and prokaryotic hosts  <cit> . recent studies regarding swollenin have mainly focused on t. reesei swoi  <cit> . moreover, the effect of swollenin in the promotion of cellulosic hydrolysis has not been well investigated.

penicillium species are another group of fungi capable of producing high activities of cellulase and hemicellulase  <cit> . they have higher β-glucosidase activity and better thermal stability of fpase activity than trichoderma species  <cit> . to explore a swollenin with higher activity, we used penicillium oxalicum for gene cloning of a novel swollenin. we present the disruptive activity of p. oxalicum swollenin on crystalline cellulose and its characteristics in enhancing cellulosic hydrolysis.

RESULTS
p. oxalicum swollenin cloning and sequence analysis
based on the alignment of published fungal swollenin sequences on genebank database, a pair of degenerate primers was designed and used to successfully amplify a 210 bp swollenin fragment from p. oxalicum genomic dna. the 5’ and 3’ flanking sequences of the isolated swollenin fragment were then obtained using the tail-pcr method. finally, the full-length coding sequence of the p. oxalicum swollenin gene was amplified from genomic dna, and termed poswo <dig> . sequence analysis showed that poswo <dig> contains  <dig>  bps interrupted by six introns, and encodes  <dig> amino acids. amino acid analysis indicated that poswoi is homologous to other fungal swollenins , and shows highly similarity  to the penicillium decumbens swollenin, whose biochemical characteristics have not yet been reported. poswoi has a predicted signal peptide of twenty amino acids at the n-terminal and four disulfide bonds . analysis using the online tool prosite  <cit>  shows that poswoi consists of a family  <dig> carbohydrate-binding module  followed by a linker connected to a family  <dig> endoglucanase-like domain . another tool, protparam,  <cit>  revealed that the instability index and the estimated half-life of poswoi is  <dig>  and >20 h, respectively, suggesting the potential stability of poswoi protein.

production of recombinant poswoi
to obtain sufficient quantities of poswoi protein, the recombinant expression of poswo <dig> was driven by the strong inducible t. reesei cellobiohydrolase i  promoter. in total, we obtained twenty transformants on selective pda plates; six with intact poswo <dig> coding sequences detected by pcr. recombinant poswoi can secrete into the culture medium and has a molecular weight  of approximately  <dig> kd . such a mw is much larger than the  <dig> kd weight calculated for poswoi. in addition, another band with a small mw of  <dig> kd was also recognized by anti-his tag antibody, probably due to minor degradation of poswoi under the denaturing conditions in sds-page.

among the six poswo <dig> transformants, transformant pos- <dig> had the highest poswoi expression level of 105 mg/l. interestingly, the expression of cellobiohydrolase i  significantly decreased in transformants highly expressing poswoi, such as transformants of pos- <dig> and pos- <dig>  however, cbhi indicated a significant expression in poswoi-less-expressed transformants, such as transformants of pos- <dig>  pos- <dig>  and pos- <dig> , resembling that in wild-type t. reesei rut-c <dig>  the pcr assay revealed the integrity of cbh <dig> cassette in the poswoi-highly-expressed transformant pos- <dig> and poswoi-less-expressed transformant pos- <dig> . the reason for the inverse expression tendency between cbhi and poswoi needs further investigation.

with consecutive manipulation of ultrafiltration, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and immobilized-metal affinity chromatography , recombinant poswoi was successfully purified, obtaining a recovery of approximately 19% .

disruptive activity of poswoi on crystalline cellulose
swollenin has been demonstrated to be able to disrupt the structure of solid substrates, such as cotton fiber, filter paper, and plant cell walls  <cit> . we incubated poswoi with avicel and observed the disruptive activity of poswoi on the substrate. images under the light microscope showed that avicel became smaller when treated with poswoi  compared with no poswoi treatment , indicating a disruptive activity of poswoi on crystalline cellulose. there was no detectable reducing sugar in the reaction containing avicel and poswoi , suggesting that the disruptive effect of poswoi on crystalline cellulose is not a hydrolytic process, similar to that of t. reesei swollenin  <cit> .

hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose by poswoi and cellulases
conversion of crystalline regions within cellulose into less crystalline structures is an essential step for efficient biomass hydrolysis  <cit> . with a disruptive activity on the crystalline structure of cellulose, poswoi might be capable of enhancing the cellulosic hydrolysis catalyzed by cellulases. we first tested whether there was synergism between poswoi and cellulases in cellulosic saccharification. as figure  <dig> showed, the avicel incubated with both poswoi and cellulases produced approximately 220 μg reducing sugars at 48 h, much more than the 150 μg that was produced by cellulases alone. the largest synergistic activity of poswoi in this assay was  <dig> % at 48 h. this showed that poswoi can facilitate the saccharification of crystalline cellulose, and that there is a synergy between poswoi and cellulases .

however, the synergy did not show linearity between the amount of poswoi and the synergistic activity. when  <dig>  μg and 3 μg poswoi was used in the reaction, the synergistic activity at 48 h was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. nevertheless, when the amount of poswoi increased to 3 μg and 10 μg, the synergistic activity merely increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. these data suggest that poswoi can become saturated, and that excessive poswoi may even inhibit the interaction between poswoi and cellulases.

in addition to the simultaneous reaction, a two-step reaction was also performed to promote enzymatic saccharification. in the first step, avicel was incubated with poswoi alone, in the same manner as the disruptive activity assay for poswoi. in the second step, poswoi was removed from avicel to minimize the binding competition of the substrate, and the pretreated avicel was subjected to hydrolysis by cellulases alone. this reaction using poswoi pretreatment produced 246 μg of reducing sugars at 48 h; nearly twice as many as the 124 μg produced by the acetate buffer control . this suggests that poswoi better facilitates the enzymatic hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose when using a pretreatment procedure.

cellulase binding on poswoi-treated crystalline cellulose
a cellulase binding assay was performed to reveal the mechanism of poswoi pretreatment on promotion of saccharification. an experiment was carried out resembling the two-step procedure except that avicel incubated with cellulases was placed at 4°c in order to minimize the cellulose hydrolysis. only  <dig> % of total cellulases bound to the avicel without poswoi pretreatment. however,  <dig> % of the total cellulases could bind to the avicel that was pretreated with poswoi, suggesting a promotion of cellulase adsorption by the pretreatment .

discussion
plant expansins have been well investigated for their relaxation activity on plant cell walls. it is believed that expansins can break down the hydrogen bonds between cellulose microfibrils without hydrolyzing them  <cit> . swollenin, the newly reported protein in filamentous fungi, has sequence and functional similarity to plant expansins  <cit> . the structure of crystalline cellulose is highly ordered and maintained mainly by a great number of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. therefore, the use of expansins or swollenin to enhance lignocellulosic hydrolysis is a promising application in the biofuel industry. baker et al.  <cit> , first used β-expansin from zea mays in the hydrolytic reaction of lignocellulose and showed that β-expansin can improve the saccharification rate over the range of 55-80% conversion. cucumber α-expansin was also able to enhance the hydrolysis of cmc-na and high-esterified pectin by endoglucanase cel 12a and pectinase, respectively  <cit> . swollenin was used in a chimeric enzyme, in which swollenin was fused upstream of feruloyl esterase a, and increased the yield of ferulic acid by 50%  <cit> . recently, an aspergillus fumigatus swollenin swo <dig> enhanced the saccharification rate of avicel by 20%   <cit> . in our study, poswoi increased the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose avicel by approximately 50%.

however, a saturation effect might exist during the reaction of poswoi. poswoi has a cbm that is also present in many cellulases. poswoi and cellulases may thus compete for the limited binding sites in crystalline cellulose. this is probably the reason why poswoi showed a saturation effect during cellulose hydrolysis, particularly when larger quantities of poswoi were used. a poswoi pretreatment was used to overcome the potential competition between poswoi and cellulases on solid substrate. we obtained a nearly 100% improvement in avicel saccharification. recently, a similar study of swollenin pretreatment has also been reported, in which kluyveromyces lactis-produced swollenin enhanced the hydrolysis of cellulosic substrates  <cit> .

several factors including the crystallinity, degree of polymerization , accessibility, particle size, and pore volume, can influence the enzymatic hydrolysis rate of crystalline cellulose  <cit> . we found that poswoi was able to disrupt the crystalline cellulose avicel into smaller particles, significantly increasing the surface area and the accessibility of the substrate, and therefore enhancing the adsorption of cellulase from the substrate. the cellulase binding assay showed that cellulase did show an increased adsorption on poswoi-pretreated avicel.

obtaining sufficient amount of active protein is a prerequisite for the study of gene function. one method to increase the yield of recombinant protein is to use a strong promoter. the t. reesei cellobiohydrolase i  promoter is considered to be one of the strongest promoters in t. reesei <cit> . we found that cbh <dig> promoter successfully drove the expression of poswo <dig>  similarly, t. pseudokoningii swollenin was efficiently produced using the cbh <dig> promoter  <cit> .

whether there is a relationship between swollenin and cbhi is not known. we found that cbhi was significantly down-regulated when poswoi was highly expressed; however, cbhi normally expressed in the transformants that produced relatively low levels of poswoi. as the c1-cx hypothesis introduced, saprophytic microbes synthesize two classes of components, including a non-hydrolytic component c <dig> and endo- or exo-acting cellulases, together termed cx  <cit> . swollenin is a good candidate for component c <dig> due to its distinct disruptive activity on crystalline cellulose  <cit> . poswoi displayed a considerable disruptive activity and was capable of enhancing the hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulases. therefore, fewer cellulases including cbhi might be competent to produce sufficient living materials for fungal growth when large quantities of poswoi are present. actually, the reducing sugar in the culture supernatant of the poswoi-highly-expressed transformant, poswoi-less-expressed transformant, and the parental strain rut-c <dig> was measured on the fifth day during cellulose induction. no significant difference among these strains in the amount of reducing sugars was observed , suggesting a facilitating effect of poswoi on cellulosic hydrolysis.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel gene poswo <dig>  with sequence similarity to t. reesei swollenins was isolated from the filamentous fungus penicillium oxalicum. recombinant poswoi was produced at a high level in t. reesei and revealed disruptive activity on crystalline cellulose. with simultaneous and two-step procedures, poswoi can significantly enhance the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose, providing a new method for the efficient bioconversion of biomass.
