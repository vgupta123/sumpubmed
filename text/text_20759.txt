BACKGROUND
the spindle assembly checkpoint  acts as a surveillance mechanism by delaying the metaphase-to-anaphase transition until all the chromosomes have properly aligned and attached to the mitotic spindle; thus, preventing chromosome instability . in the presence of even a single improperly attached kinetochore, sac is activated to inhibit a large multisubunit e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome , and prevents anaphase onset  <cit> . apc/c activity requires the association of cdc <dig> in early mitosis, while cdh <dig>  is required to activate apc/c in late mitosis and during g <dig>  <cit> . the primary target of sac is the cdc <dig> activator that, when inhibited, cannot activate apc/c to degrade securin  <cit> . degradation of securin is required for activation of separase and cleavage of cohesion between sister chromatids which in turn triggers anaphase onset in mitotic cells  <cit> .

the first identified components of sac were isolated in two independent genetic screens in saccharomyces cerevisiae and include mad <dig>  mad <dig>  mad <dig>  bub <dig>  and bub <dig>  <cit> . these proteins are widely conserved, both structurally and functionally, throughout the eukaryotic kingdoms  <cit> . however, additional proteins essential for the checkpoint activity have continued to be discovered in higher eukaryotes. these include rod , zw <dig>  and cenp-f proteins, among others  <cit> . these components lack clear yeast orthologs, suggesting that, in higher eukaryotes, checkpoint signaling is more elaborate.

the sac components and the checkpoint signalling pathway are highly conserved in c. elegans. the c. elegans homologues of the sac components, originally discovered in yeast, have been identified and named mdf- <dig>  mdf- <dig>  san- <dig>  bub- <dig> and bub- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . recent availability of knockout alleles of these checkpoint components, in addition to rna interference  experiments, allowed assessment of the phenotypic consequences in the absence of the sac gene products  <cit> . all of these genes are important for genome stability and viability in the presence of spindle damage  <cit> . however, while mdf- <dig>  san- <dig>  and bub- <dig> become essential only in the presence of chemical or mutational disruptions of the mitotic spindle  <cit> , bub- <dig> and mdf- <dig> are essential for embryonic viability, long-term survival and fertility under normal laboratory conditions in c. elegans  <cit> . in fact, analysis of an mdf- <dig> deletion mutant, mdf- <dig>  gave the first demonstration of what affect a defective checkpoint has on animal development  <cit> . in the absence of mdf- <dig>  severe developmental defects are observed, including embryonic lethality, larval arrests, abnormal vulva development, and sterility, which lead to lethality of the homozygous strain after three generations  <cit> . similar developmental defects have also been observed in the absence of mdf- <dig>  <cit> ; however, unlike Δmdf- <dig> animals, Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes can be propagated indefinitely  <cit> . the fact that absence of different sac components leads to different developmental consequences in c. elegans, as well as other organisms  <cit> , suggests differential requirement of these genes in development and fertility that may or may not be distinct from their function in sac.

to investigate roles sac genes have during postembryonic development of a multicellular organism, we studied spatiotemporal expression patterns of the checkpoint genes. as expected, sac promoters drive mainly ubiquitous gfp expression during early embryonic development. however, all sac promoters drive tissue-specific expression in later developmental stages. further analysis revealed that the mdf- <dig> checkpoint component is required for proper postembryonic proliferation of seam cells by regulating apc/ccdc <dig>  in fact, seam cell proliferation was abrogated at a higher frequency during the proliferative l <dig> stage than in the embryo, suggesting that postembryonic cell divisions may be more sensitive to loss of the checkpoint than the embryonic cell divisions. furthermore, we showed that while the hypomorphic mutant fzy- <dig> fully restored proper seam cell proliferation; fzr-1/cdh <dig> mutant had no effect on seam cell development in a Δmdf- <dig> background.

RESULTS
generation of psac::gfp c. elegans strains and characterization of sac expression patterns
in order to explore the temporal and spatial expression of sac genes, we generated transcriptional reporter transgenic c. elegans strains for the five widely conserved checkpoint core components  and four sac components only conserved in higher eukaryotes  . all of the selected genes, except for mdf- <dig>  are not in operons, and thus sequences immediately upstream were used for their promoter analysis. mdf- <dig>  on the other hand, is part of an operon and was probed using three different promoter constructs . the promoter::gfp fusions were generated using a "pcr stitching" technique  <cit> , rather than by cloning methods, to avoid potential interference from cloning vector backbones on transgene expressions, as reported recently by etchberger and hobert,  <dig>  <cit> . the putative "promoter" amplicons were "pcr-stitched" to the pcr products containing a gfp encoding sequence  that includes artificial introns and the unc- <dig> 3'utr from the ppd <dig>  vector . the 5' regions examined in this study as putatively containing regulators of the sac genes extended from the predicted atg initiator site for a targeted gene to its adjacent upstream gene. the lengths of the upstream regions defined by these criteria range in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp  and are in accordance with previously described minimum and maximum promoter lengths used in large scale projects  <cit> . in total,  <dig> transcriptional fusions with gfp were constructed corresponding to the nine checkpoint genes of interest . for each construct, we generated at least three independent lines that were compared for expression pattern consistencies. due to the mosaicism issues associated with extrachromosomal concatameric arrays, we analyzed at least  <dig> replicates and recorded gfp-expressing cells and tissues that showed expression in at least 50% of the animals at any given developmental stage, as described previously  <cit> .

our analysis of sac gene regulatory activities revealed that all of the sac constructs, except for pczw-1::gfp, confer gfp expression . the  <dig>  bp sequence upstream of czw- <dig> did not drive any detectable gfp expression at any developmental stage in any of the four independent transgenic lines analyzed. we also examined another construct that contained  <dig> kb upstream sequence of czw- <dig> and still did not observe any expression . importantly, our analysis of the other eight sac genes revealed expression that was consistent between the independent lines for every given construct . we have detected gfp at all developmental stages, except for very young embryos , and have identified expressed gfp in all the major tissues, except for germline, likely due to germline silencing of concatameric arrays  <cit> .

promoters of spindle assembly checkpoint genes drive similar early embryonic expression
gfp expression driven by the eight sac gene upstream regions containing regulatory sequences  was commonly observed early in development, well before the comma stage of embryogenesis . in fact, we were able to detect gfp expression before embryos progressed to gastrulation . because we observed mosaicism due to mitotic loss of the concatamer arrays , we analyzed many embryos per construct. our results show that sac gene promoters drive gfp expression in the majority of the early embryonic cells . the only construct that did not drive ubiquitous gfp expression in early embryos is the putative promoter of mdf- <dig>  which is in an operon, that extends upstream from the atg initiator site in the first gene, his- <dig>  of the operon to the adjacent upstream gene  . on the other hand, both transcriptional fusions that included an internal mdf- <dig> promoter revealed the same ubiquitous activities in early embryos . considering the established role of the mdf- <dig> checkpoint gene in surveillance of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, as well as the observed antibody localization in dividing cells in early embryos  <cit> , we conclude that the mdf- <dig> containing operon belongs to the "hybrid operons" class  <cit> , in which the internal promoter of mdf- <dig> is necessary to drive proper expression of this gene in embryonic cells.

the cell cycles of early embryonic cells in c. elegans are rapid, consist entirely of s phase and mitosis, and lack gap phases  <cit> . this rapid embryonic cell proliferation creates more than half of c. elegans' somatic cells, with the majority of cell divisions being completed in the first half of embryogenesis  <cit> . thus, co-expression of sac genes in the rapidly dividing early embryonic cells  is consistent with the well established role of these genes in cell division. in addition to the activities of sac gene promoters in the early embryos, we also observed gfp expression in later embryos for all of the spindle-checkpoint promoters that we analyzed. the expression patterns in late embryos show gfp expression in the majority of the cells, although the majority of the promoter constructs tend to confer more localized gfp expression, as exemplified for mdf- <dig> . together, the expected promoter activities of sac genes during embryogenesis, show that the promoters used for our analysis are appropriate.

sac promoters drive tissue-specific gene expression later in development
rapid cell proliferation occurs in all four larval stages especially in the second larval stage  of development in c. elegans when many somatic cells are generated  <cit> . as expected, gfp expression conferred by sac gene promoters was detected at all four larval stages . unlike embryonic expression, spatiotemporal analysis revealed that postembryonic expression of sac genes is generally restricted to specific cells and tissues types . for example, mdf- <dig> promoter drives gfp expression in seams cells , gut cells , and some additional tissue types  at all larval stages. in contrast, mdf-1internal and rod- <dig> promoters drive gfp expression specifically in gut cells after embryogenesis . unlike mdf- <dig>  mdf- <dig> and rod- <dig> promoters, hcp- <dig> promoter was found to be active in the majority, but not all, tissues analyzed, including dorsal/ventral nerve cord, head/tail/body neurons and many other tissue types . thus, postembryonic spatial analysis revealed distinct, yet overlapping, tissue-specific expression of sac genes during larval development.

unexpectedly, we also observed tissue-specific expression of sac genes at late larval  and adult stage . since there are no cell divisions during late l <dig> and at adulthood except for the divisions in somatic gonads that lead to oocyte development  <cit> , our observations suggest that sac genes are expressed in non-proliferating cells in c. elegans. similar to larval expression profiles, tissue-specific expression is observed in adult animals as well. for example, as in larvae, mdf- <dig> promoter drives gfp expression in seam cells and hypodermis , gut cells , pharynx , and vulva . the expression patterns detected in adult tissues further support the striking co-expression of the checkpoint genes in hypodermal seam cells  and intestine  that we observed in larval stages.

absence of mdf- <dig> results in aberrant number and alignment of seam cell nuclei
we were interested in testing whether absent or nonfunctional sac would cause aberrant postembryonic seam cell development. for this analysis, we chose mdf- <dig>  mdf- <dig> shares 40% sequence identity with budding yeast mad <dig> and rescues benomyl sensitivity of the mad <dig> knockout strain in yeast, suggesting functional checkpoint conservation  <cit> . like Δmdf- <dig>  absence of mdf- <dig> leads to severe defects in larval and germ cell development, suggesting essential roles in postembryonic development  <cit> . unlike Δmdf- <dig>  knockout strain of mdf- <dig> is viable  <cit> .

our spatiotemporal analysis using extra-chromosomal concatameric arrays revealed that the promoter of mdf- <dig> drives expression of the gfp reporter in hypodermis and seam cells , and some other cell types. we also constructed two chromosomal integrant pmdf-2::gfp strains, a multi-copy stable line , and a stable line generated using the recently developed mos1-mediated single-copy insertion  method  <cit> . using the multi-copy stable line, we observed similar expression patterns in hypodermis and seam cells , and other cell types. mossci method, on the other hand, allows integration of transgenes as single copies at a few specific loci in c. elegans' genome. although the pmdf-2::gfp stable line generated using mossci had >  <dig> × lower intensity of the gfp expression than the multi-copy stable line , it further confirmed the expression patterns that we observed using a pmdf-2::gfp extrachromosomal transgene in postembryonic hypodermis and seam cells .

to determine the consequence of absence of mdf- <dig> on normal seam cell development, we examined and quantified the number of seam cell nuclei in transgenic strains expressing scm::gfp  <cit>   in the mdf- <dig> knockout, Δmdf- <dig>  background using fluorescence microscopy . the tm <dig> deletion removes  <dig> nucleotides between intron  <dig> and exon  <dig> and is likely to be a null mutation. the scm::gfp marker allows visualization of the number of seam cell nuclei and their morphology during development. our analysis of young adult animals homozygous for Δmdf- <dig> revealed both qualitative and quantitative difference compared to wild-type animals . while wild-type adult hermaphrodites usually contain  <dig> evenly spaced and aligned scm::gfp nuclei on each side of the animals  <cit>  , Δmdf- <dig> adult hermaphrodites frequently have non-aligned seam cell nuclei clustered in one part of the body . such clustering appears to be stochastic  and each cluster can contain two , three , four  or even more seam cell nuclei . more often, certain seam cells are missing , resulting in fewer than  <dig> scm::gfp nuclei observed in wild-type animals . collectively, in the absence of mdf- <dig>  the number of scm::gfp nuclei is significantly decreased in young adult worms from  <dig>  to  <dig> in Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes  . furthermore, using ajm-1::gfp apical junction marker  <cit> , we observed disruptions of seam syncytia in Δmdf- <dig> homozygote adult worms , which further supports the importance of mdf- <dig> for proper seam cell development.

all of the strains are homozygous for the seam cell marker wis <dig> . the number of scm::gfp positive nuclei was scored  <dig> h after hatching , two days after hatching  and  <dig> h after l <dig> stage . asterisk denotes significant difference when compared to wild type using unpaired students t-test analysis  young adult worms could be either due to defective embryonic cell divisions, or alternatively, defective postembryonic divisions. in order to address these two possibilities, we scored the number of seam cell nuclei in newly hatched wild-type and Δmdf- <dig> l <dig> larvae. the wild-type animals analyzed had an average number of  <dig>  scm::gfp nuclei per side  . similarly, the majority of the Δmdf- <dig> newly hatched larvae had  <dig> scm::gfp positive nuclei with  <dig>  average and 8- <dig> range . although, unpaired students t-test analysis revealed a significant difference , both the quantitative and qualitative defects observed in Δmdf- <dig> newly hatched larvae were much less severe than defects observed in l <dig>  or adults  . therefore, we conclude that mdf- <dig> plays an important role in postembryonic seam cell development.

recently, it was reported that mdf- <dig> plays an important role in nutrient-deprivation induced somatic cell arrest  <cit> . namely, it was found that hemizygosity of mdf- <dig> causes an increase in seam cell numbers from  <dig>  observed in wild-type l <dig> worms starved for four days, to between  <dig> and  <dig> in more than half of the mdf-1/+ l <dig> worms. to analyze the ability of mdf- <dig> hemizygotes to arrest the proliferation during l <dig> diapause, we starved wild-type and Δmdf-2/+ hatchlings for four days. subsequent analysis of the seam cells revealed that neither wild-type  nor Δmdf-2/+  larvae had more than  <dig> scm::gfp-positive nuclei, indicating starvation-induced l <dig> larval arrest. thus, unlike mdf- <dig>  mdf- <dig> component of the sac does not seem to be required for starvation-induced somatic cell cycle arrest.

the seam cell defect of mdf- <dig> is due to defects in the proliferative seam cell division
the seam cells have stem cell-like properties and divide four times in developing larva for self-renewal maintenance, expansion, and to produce differentiated cells  <cit> . six out of  <dig> embryonic seam cells, h <dig>  v1-v <dig> and v <dig>  undergo self-renewal expansion division at l <dig>  resulting in an increase in the number of seam cells to  <dig>  <cit>  . to determine if the seam cell defect observed in Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes is due to a defect in proliferative cell division, we determined the number of scm::gfp positive nuclei at late l <dig> and l <dig>  we observed a mean of  <dig>   seam cell nuclei at late l <dig> in the Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes  and a mean of  <dig>   seam cell nuclei at l <dig> in the Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes , which is not significantly different from the number of scm::gfp nuclei observed in later stages of the Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes  . these data demonstrate that the seam cell defect observed in Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes is most likely due to cell division defects at l <dig> 

we next examined whether reduction of seam cell number could be attributed to failure of cell cycle progression of specific seam cells . we counted how often the observed seam cell defect is a consequence of failure of cell cycle progression of one particular cell . our analysis only includes unambiguous instances, where the identity of the defective nuclei could be determined . the cases where the identity of the defective seam nucleus is ambiguous, as in figure 6b, were excluded from the analysis. we observed defects in all of the seam cells, h0- <dig>  v1-v <dig> and t , suggesting that failure of cell division affects all the cells in the seam cell linage. however, the frequencies of defects are different between the seam cells. for example, h <dig> seam cell defect was observed only once in  <dig> animals scored . the h <dig> cells are the only cells, from the seam cell lineage, that do not undergo postembryonic division, further confirming the previous findings that the seam cell defect observed in Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes is mainly due to postembryonic defects. similarly, h <dig>  v <dig> and t cell defects were rarely observed . in contrast, frequent defects were observed in the six seam cells, h <dig>  v1-v <dig> and v <dig> that undergo expansion division to generate an additional six seam cells at l <dig> and beyond. these data support the findings that seam cell defects likely arise in l <dig> Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes. furthermore, we quantified extra seam cell nuclei  versus missing seam cell nuclei  and, as expected, we observed that reduction of the number of scm::gfp positive nuclei is a much more common event . representative images of seam cell reduction due to a failure of cell cycle progression of a particular lineage are shown in figure  <dig>  together, these data indicate that seam cell defects in the absence of mdf- <dig> are mainly attributed to cell proliferation failure at l <dig> which randomly affects h <dig>  v1-v <dig> or v <dig> seam cells.

the seam cell reduction in mdf- <dig> is not likely to be caused by ced- <dig> dependent cell death
it is possible that the reduction of number of seam cells in Δmdf- <dig> worms is caused by cell damage followed by apoptotic cell death. ced- <dig> is a member of the caspase family of cystein proteases that is required for cell death in c. elegans  <cit> . to determine whether apoptotic cell death could account for loss of seam cells, we constructed ced- <dig> unc- <dig> mdf- <dig> in which there is no cell death. we found that ced- <dig> unc- <dig> mutants do not affect seam cell development, as on average  <dig>  seam cell nuclei were observed in young adults  . furthermore, we found that ced- <dig> unc- <dig> mdf- <dig> animals had similar numbers of seam cell nuclei  as mdf- <dig>  suggesting that ced- <dig> dependent cell death is unlikely to be responsible for seam cell loss in the tm <dig> background.

all of the strains are homozygous for the seam cell marker wis <dig> . the number of scm::gfp positive nuclei was scored in young adult hermaphrodites. note that data for wild-type and mdf- <dig> young adults are duplicates of the data shown in table  <dig> 

absence of fzr- <dig> enhances sterility of mdf- <dig> mutants without causing any effect on seam cell development
during postembryonic development, seam cell division is regulated at the g <dig> to s phase progression by a cascade of regulatory factors that include lin-35/rb, fzr-1/cdh <dig>  and cki- <dig>  <cit> . as lin- <dig> and fzr- <dig> act redundantly to control the g <dig> to s phase progression, seam cell proliferation appears to be normal in lin- <dig> and fzr- <dig> single mutants, while extensive hyperproliferation is observed in lin-35; fzr- <dig> double mutants  <cit> . furthermore, lin- <dig> and fzr- <dig> single mutants rescue postembryonic seam cell defects in bro- <dig> single mutants  <cit> . bro- <dig> is the c. elegans cbfβ homolog that is required for the normal proliferation and differentiation of seam cells  <cit> . to determine whether or not lin- <dig> and fzr- <dig> mutants play a role in the defective postembryonic cell proliferation in the mdf- <dig> background, we examined genetic interactions by constructing lin-35; mdf- <dig> and fzr-1; mdf- <dig> double mutants. we found that 100% of the lin-35; mdf- <dig> double mutants are sterile, making the analysis of seam cell development difficult. we also found synthetic enhanced interaction between fzr- <dig> and mdf- <dig> mutants . the ok <dig> deletion removes  <dig> nucleotides between intron  <dig> and exon  <dig> and is predicted to result in truncated fzr- <dig>  which may or may not be functional. fzr- <dig> homozygotes can be easily propagated and exhibit no major developmental abnormalities. as reported previously, mdf- <dig> homozygotes can be maintained at 20°c indefinitely but display a severely reduced brood size of approximately  <dig> progeny/worm  of which only 40% develop into adults  <cit>  . once we constructed Δfzr-1; Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes, we immediately observed that these worms are extremely difficult to propagate due to the small number of progeny that reach adulthood. our detailed analysis of Δfzr-1; Δmdf- <dig> double mutants revealed that they have significantly reduced brood sizes   and significantly reduced numbers of fertile adults , resulting in only two or three fertile adult progeny per hermaphrodite compared to about  <dig> to  <dig> fertile adults produced by Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes . furthermore, we observed that while Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes displayed cin as determined by high incidence of males  phenotype , Δfzr- <dig> increases this chromosome instability to ~6% .

even though Δfzr-1; Δmdf- <dig> double mutants are difficult to grow, we collected enough adult progeny for analysis of postembryonic seam cell proliferation. as expected, we found that Δfzr- <dig> homozygotes  had on average  <dig>  scm::gfp nuclei  not significantly different from wild-type . however, we found that Δfzr- <dig> had no effect on seam cell proliferation in the mdf- <dig> background as Δfzr-1; Δmdf- <dig> double mutants had on average  <dig>   seam cell nuclei not significantly different from the Δmdf- <dig> animals . taken together, these data suggest that although mdf- <dig> displays synthetic lethality and enhanced phenotype with lin- <dig> and fzr- <dig>  this pathway is unlikely explanation for postembryonic cell proliferation defect observed in the absence of mdf- <dig> spindle-checkpoint using the seam cell lineage.

hypomorphic mutant fzy- <dig> partially suppresses lethality of mdf- <dig> mutants and completely rescues seam cell defects
the hypomorphic mutant allele of fzy- <dig> h <dig>  was isolated from the screen for suppressors of the mdf- <dig> lethal phenotype in search for additional components that function in the metaphase-to-anaphase transition  <cit> . the h <dig> allele is a missense mutation and the resulting fzy-1d433n mutant protein cannot properly bind the apc/c substrate ify- <dig>   <cit> . subsequently, it has been shown that fzy- <dig> rescues mdf- <dig> lethality likely by delaying anaphase onset because the duration of mitosis in fzy- <dig> early-stage embryos is extended, presumably due to an increased level of securin  <cit> . while the main function of mdf- <dig> may be regulation of apc/c activity  <cit> , the precise role for mdf- <dig> is currently unknown.

fzy- <dig> homozygotes can be easily propagated and the strain exhibits a slight decrease in the brood size and an increase in incidence of males with no apparent abnormalities in growth or morphology  <cit> . to determine whether fzy- <dig> can rescue lethality of the mdf- <dig>  we constructed fzy-1; mdf- <dig>  we observed that fzy- <dig> has no significant effect on brood sizes of Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes . however, fzy-1; Δmdf- <dig> worms produce on average 85% progeny that develop into adults, compared to ~40% observed for Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes . furthermore, the majority  of fzy-1; Δmdf- <dig> adult progeny are fertile , suggesting that fzy- <dig> can suppress the sterility caused by the absence of mdf- <dig>  also, we observed that fzy- <dig> decreases incidence of males from ~3% observed in the Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes to ~ <dig> % observed in double mutants. together, these data further confirm that like mdf- <dig>  mdf- <dig> regulates apc/ccdc <dig> activity during development.

next, we examined if fzy- <dig> has an effect on seam cell development. interestingly, we found that fzy- <dig> homozygotes had on average  <dig>   seam nuclei not significantly different from wild-type animals . furthermore, seam cell development in fzy-1; Δmdf- <dig> double mutants appeared to be completely normal . namely, fzy-1; Δmdf- <dig> double mutants had on average  <dig>   seam cell nuclei not significantly different from the wild-type or fzy- <dig> homozygous animals . in addition, the majority of the analyzed fzy-1; Δmdf- <dig> young adults had  <dig> evenly spaced and aligned scm::gfp nuclei. these results suggest that mdf- <dig> plays an important role in postembryonic seam cell proliferation by inhibiting the activity of the apc/ccdc <dig> 

discussion
in this work we have examined for the first time in vivo spatiotemporal expression profiles of eight spindle-checkpoint genes in c. elegans. among these eight genes, five are conserved from yeast to human   <cit> , while three are conserved in higher eukaryotes , including c. elegans  <cit> . our study focused on analysis of the expression patterns by using extra-chromosomal arrays. to maximally reduce the effect of mosaicism, the known caveat of this approach, we analyzed a large number of animals for each developmental stage, and recorded the tissues and cells where gfp expression was consistently observed. on the other hand, we found the mosaicism to be beneficial for a better identification of tissues where gfp is expressed. when promoters drive gfp expression in more than one tissue types, then expression restricted to only small groups of cells, due to loss of the array, offers more confident identification of these tissues. also, gfp expression is a sensitive technique which is important for sac gene expression analysis because generally sac genes do not produce an abundant number of transcripts. concatamer arrays were previously suggested to be a sensitive tool for detecting gene expression for genes with low levels of transcription  <cit> . we confirmed the sensitivity of this approach when we generated a pmdf-2::gfp stable line using mossci  <cit> . this stable line had very low gfp signal intensity and required long exposure times for the expression to be observed.

the 5' dna sequences selected as containing putative promoters of the sac genes displayed common early embryonic activities in the majority, if not all, of the rapidly dividing embryonic cells. this finding is consistent with the known roles of the checkpoint genes in cell division. we expected this result because of the fact that  <dig> of the  <dig> somatic cells present in adult hermaphrodite are generated during embryogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, our observations of early embryonic expression is supported by published analyses which used antibodies against some of the sac gene products  <cit> . thus, it is likely that these transcriptional fusions recapitulate endogenous sac gene promoter activities. importantly, this common "ubiquitous" expression of sac genes  during early embryogenesis, suggests that expression of mdf- <dig>  the only one located within an operon, has to be driven by the internal promoter . thus, the mdf- <dig> containing operon is likely a "hybrid operon"  <cit> .

czw- <dig>  was also included in our study; however, analysis of two different constructs did not reveal any detectable gfp expression. it is possible that expression of the analyzed transgenes was either too low for visible detection, germline specific, conditional, or that regulatory elements of this gene are located in regions not included by our putative promoter selection criteria.

in contrast to expression in embryos, postembryonic expression of sac genes in c. elegans is more localized. during the four larval stages in a hermaphrodite, the  <dig> undifferentiated somatic blast cells generate an additional  <dig> somatic nuclei  <cit> . the somatic blast cell divisions generate somatic gonad, muscle, coelomocytes, nerves, hypodermis and intestine  <cit> . if all of the checkpoint genes played the same role in postembryonic development, one would expect to observe the same expression patterns for the sac genes. however, our analysis revealed that checkpoint promoters generally dictate differential postembryonic expression patterns. for example, it is very interesting that mdf-1internal and the rod- <dig> promoters drive gfp expression exclusively in intestine after embryogenesis, while the hcp- <dig> promoter drives gfp expression in multiple tissues . these findings suggest distinct, yet overlapping, roles of the checkpoint genes in postembryonic development and provide an excellent resource for further research. recently, staining of newly hatched l <dig> larva with anti-mdf- <dig> antibody revealed specific localization of mdf- <dig> to intestinal cells and germ cell precursors  <cit> , which further supports our findings from using the transcriptional reporter system. we did not observe expression in germ cell precursors or any other germ cells possibly due to silencing of concatamer transgenes in the germinal gonad.

an unexpected finding from our analysis was tissue-specific expression of sac genes in late l <dig> and adults that contain no somatic cells destined to divide. considering that tissue-specificity observed in these stages was similar to the tissue-specificity observed in larval stages, it is possible that the observed patterns reflect longer turnover times for the gfp carried over from earlier larval stages  <cit> . on the other hand, it is possible that 5' upstream sequences used in our analysis do not include important "repressor" elements that are required for proper expression of sac genes. alternatively, it may be that sac genes have roles in these adult tissues that remain to be uncovered.

we have found that spindle-checkpoint genes reveal an intriguing co-expression in hypodermal seam cells. this finding prompted us to use the seam cell lineage to test the functional importance of the checkpoint for proper postembryonic cell proliferation. here, we demonstrated that the knockout allele, tm <dig>  of mdf- <dig> results in defective seam cell development that is mainly attributed to seam cell proliferation failure at l <dig>  in the absence of mdf- <dig>  on average  <dig> seam cell nuclei were observed instead of expected  <dig>  the number of scm::gfp nuclei per side of an animal ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> in the absence of mdf- <dig> . while the majority of the Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes contains less than expected  <dig> seam cell nuclei per side in young adults, we also observed animals that had more than  <dig> seam cell nuclei , which could be attributed to defective cell division. the results presented in this paper provide the first evidence that embryonic cell divisions are more tolerant to the loss of sac, in particular mdf- <dig>  than postembryonic cell divisions, as determined using the seam cell lineage. furthermore, we show that the importance of mdf- <dig> for proper seam cell proliferation depends on its regulation of apc/ccdc <dig>  the seam cell defect in Δmdf- <dig> homozygotes cannot be explained by cell damage followed by caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death, since ced- <dig> mutant had no effect on seam cell defect in Δmdf- <dig> worms. furthermore, fzy- <dig> rescued all of the Δmdf- <dig> phenotypes, except for the brood size. on the other hand, g <dig> phase regulators, lin- <dig> and fzr- <dig>  when defective affect only brood size in the absence of mdf- <dig>  the analysis presented here, using the Δmdf- <dig>  serves as an excellent model for further studies on effects of a defective sac on development of different tissues in a multicellular organism.

a striking emerging pattern is that essentially all sac genes are expressed in intestine and hypodermis. sac components mdf- <dig>  <cit>  and mdf- <dig>  <cit>  have previously been observed to be localized to gut cells by using antibody staining. endoreduplication, also known as endoreplication, is a process in which s phases are not followed by mitosis. this process gives rise to cells with extra copies of chromosomes, permitting amplification of the genome in specialized cells. in humans, these include hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes and megakaryocytes  <cit> . in c. elegans, two tissues are polyploid: the hypodermis and the intestine  <cit> . our finding of co-expression of sac genes in these tissues may suggest a possible role of these genes in the process of endoreduplication in c. elegans. furthermore, our findings clearly suggest that sac genes are differentially regulated at the transcription level at different developmental stages.

CONCLUSIONS
we have examined for the first time in vivo spatiotemporal expression profiles of eight conserved spindle assembly checkpoint genes in c. elegans. our comprehensive analysis revealed that all of the sac gene promoters displayed common early embryonic activities in the majority, if not all, of the rapidly dividing embryonic cells. furthermore, we found that all of the sac gene promoters drive tissue specific postembryonic expression. the expression patterns differ between the sac genes; the majority of the sac genes co-express in hypodermal seam cells and gut cells. these findings suggest that the sac components may have distinct roles in postembryonic development which could be different from their role in mitosis. furthermore, our analysis provides an important starting point for analysis of the checkpoint roles in development of a multicellular eukaryote that may offer explanation for distinct phenotypic consequence upon inactivation of different sac genes. it is extremely important to determine how defects in different sac components affect cell proliferation, cell fate determination and cell differentiation in a multicellular organism.
