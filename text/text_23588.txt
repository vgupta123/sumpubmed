BACKGROUND
coagulase-negative staphylococci  are highly abundant on the human skin, already a few hours after birth. the cons staphylococcus epidermidis is an ubiquitous and permanent colonizer of human skin and the first cause of nosocomial infections  <cit> . most infections with high morbidity and mortality are caused by methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus epidermidis   <cit> . in addition, many mrse strains form a capsule which favors biofilm development, where the pathogen can persist protected from antibiotics and invisible to the immune system  <cit> .

new, unconventional antimicrobials are therefore urgently needed  <cit> . in this context, antimicrobial peptides , in their natural form or after chemical modification, display interesting features as candidates to become new antimicrobials. they have a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, can be easily synthesized in laboratory and have limited toxicity for eukaryotic cells  <cit> . as innate immune components, amps lack specificity and immune memory, with the consequence that the pathogens rarely develop resistance to them  <cit> . importantly, amps rapidly intercept and kill pathogens  <cit> . amps differ each other by size, sequence and secondary structure   <cit> . most of them are hydrophobic and amphipathic  <cit> . amps can exert their activity by disrupting the membrane  <cit>  or passing through the bacterial membrane  <cit> . molecules belonging to the former class of amps permeabilize the membrane phospholipids bi-layer and kill the bacterial cell; those belonging to the latter class pass through the bacterial membrane and interacts with variable intracellular components, much as traditional antibiotics. amps, in addition to the antimicrobial activity, display also immune-modulatory properties  and interact with natural and adaptive immunity  <cit> . thus, in view of the above properties, amps represent one of the most promising future strategies for combating infections and microbial drug resistance. the present study describes two chemically modified amps - an analogue of the temporin b  secreted by the granular glands of the european red frog   <cit>  and an analogue of the royal jellein i  secreted by the mandible and hypopharyngeal glands of honeybees   <cit> . these two peptides behave differently towards the bacterial membrane. rji-c folds into beta sheets and aggregates onto the membrane; tb-kk folds into an alpha helix and does not aggregate onto the membrane  <cit> .

recent data demonstrate that hydrophobic peptides, when mixed with peptides possessing a net positive charge, give origin to a mixture with potential antibacterial activity  <cit> ; second, that the combination of antimicrobial peptides derived from different organisms are highly active against gram positive bacteria  <cit> . in agreement with these results, here we show that a mixture of tb-kk and rji-c – two amps derived from different sources - displays strong antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria - modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide production, in vitro and in vivo. the two peptides, following chemical modification, potentially can be made available in large quantities and in a homogeneous and highly pure form.

RESULTS
characterization of staphylococcus epidermidis strains
to establish the clonal origin of the staphylococcus epidermidis strains used in the study, the strains  were characterized phenotypically - with respect to their antibiotic resistance pattern and molecularly with respect to their restriction endonucleases analysis  pattern. all strains resulted resistant to aztreonam , bacitracin , cloxacillin  and metronidazole  and sensitive to imipenem . the remaining  <dig> antibiotics displayed a strain specific pattern . also, with one exception , the strains displayed all different macro-restriction patterns, when analyzed by sma i rea-page . thus, the strains used in this study belong to different clonal lineages.

r= strain resistant to the antibiotic.

s= strain sensitive to the antibiotic.

i= intermediate strains sensitive to the antibiotic.

in vitro antimicrobial activity of tb-kk and rji-c
to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of rji-c, rjii-c, rjiii-c and tb-kk  these amps were tested in vitro  <cit> , individually and in combination, against  <dig> staphylococcus epidermidis strains. among the three royal jelleins, rji-c showed the highest activity  . tested in various combination , the royal jelleins did not display synergistic effects. only rji-c was thus tested for synergism with tb-kk. the combination of the two antimicrobials – rji-c at 9 μg/ml and tb-kk at 6 μg/ml  – displayed a fractional inhibitory concentration index ≤  <dig> , which is evidence of synergism  <cit>  . the strains of staphylococcus epidermidis were all sensitive to the mix, but not its components . this conclusion is supported by the larger inhibition ring of the mix, compared to that of the individual components .

interestingly, the antibacterial activity of the mix against probiotics bacteria  was five-fold lower than that of gentamicin .

in vitro hemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the mix
to test the cytotoxic activity of the mix, we used the hemolytic and the lc <dig> assays. the mix lysed less than 12% of the murine erythrocytes  and the lc <dig> value was  <dig>  mg/ml versus  <dig>  μg/ml of tb-kk and  <dig>  μg/ml of rji-c . the mix was not toxic towards the macrophage j <dig> cells, which remained vital at 72 hours .

in vitro the mix does not induce synthesis of no-2
the mix  did not induce no2- synthesis in j <dig> cells. rather, when these cells were stimulated with lps  and then treated with the rj-ic, tb-kk and mix reduced no2- synthesis , one of the parameters to determine the cellular toxicity.

data are expressed as micromoles of no2- for  <dig> input cells, and are means ± standard deviation of three different experiments each performed in triplicate.

in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of the mix
to investigate whether the mix, in addition to the antimicrobial activity, also displays anti-inflammatory activity, j <dig> cells  were stimulated with either lps or lta  for 3 hours. the results show that lps stimulates inflammation in the j <dig> cells better than lta . later, j <dig> cells were treated with gentamicin , acetylsalicylic acid  or mix  for 3 hours. in the absence of the agent causing inflammation , the mix, gentamicin and asa do not induce inflammation . in j <dig> cells  stimulated with lps for 3 hours, the mix curbs the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-α and ifn-γ more efficiently than gentamicin and at the same extent of the asa .

these experiments demonstrate that the mix exerts anti-inflammatory as well as antimicrobial activities, while the single components of the mix have no anti-inflammatory activity . since cox- <dig> is a well-established parameter of inflammation  <cit>  , the j <dig> cells were stimulated with lps  and 1 hour later treated with the mix, rjii-c , acetylsalicylic acid , gentamicin or vehicle  for 3 hours. the level of the cox- <dig> protein was then detected by western blot. the mix-treated cells, displayed a cox- <dig> protein level comparable to that of the cells treated with asa or gentamicin, and much lower than that of the cells treated with rjii-c or the vehicle . the above results demonstrate that the mix curbs inflammation to the same extent as asa  <cit> .

in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of the mix in mice stimulated with lps
to investigate further the property of the mix to curb inflammation in vivo, lps  was administrated to four groups of mice . after 3 hours, the groups were treated respectively with the mix , gentamicin  or asa . the last group received 100 μl of saline buffer as control. after 3 hours, the mice that received the mix showed a reduced level of both the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-α and ifn-γ, when compared to gentamicin-treated group, but an higher expression level of ifn- γ, when compared to the asa group . in conclusion, the mix performs better than gentamicin, but worse than asa.

in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of the mix given intravenously at  <dig> hours post infection
to evaluate the efficacy of the mix to contrast microbial infection, four groups of mice  were infected with lethal dose  of staphylococcus epidermidis . this strain was chosen since it is resistant to the majority of the antibiotics tested .

one group did not receive any treatment ; a second group received sterile pbs  ; the third group received the mix ; the fourth group received gentamicin . pbs, mix and gentamicin were administered intravenously at 3 hours post infection. in both, placebo and control groups, the bacterial load of kidneys and spleens increased progressively, while it decreased in the groups treated with gentamicin or the mix . upon treatment of the mice with the mix, the acute phase proteins, which represent important markers of inflammation  <cit> , were evaluated . the saa , haptoglobin and fibrinogen were within normal ranges in the mice treated with the mix or with gentamicin, while significantly high in the control mice  .

in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy of the mix given intravenously at  <dig> hours post infection
the four groups of mice described before have been used also to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the mix. for this purpose, the expression levels of the tnf-α , ifn-γ, il- <dig> cytokine genes were measured at  <dig>   <dig> and 9 hours after treatment in the kidney samples . in the group treated with the mix, the tnf-α and ifn-γ were under expressed , as compared to the group treated with gentamicin . this result suggests that the mix controls inflammation better than gentamicin.

also cd <dig> and cox- <dig> markers of inflammation in vivo were evaluated. blood samples were collected  <dig>   <dig>  or 9 hours after the treatments. cd <dig> was measured by flow cytometry . six and nine hours after the treatment with gentamicin or the mix, the mice displayed a decreased expression of the cd <dig> marker . the level of cox- <dig>  was evaluated by rt-pcr on the mrna extracted from kidney samples. in control mice displayed a significantly higher expression level of cox- <dig>  compared to the mice treated with mix or gentamicin. in the control mice cox- <dig> peaked 3 hours after the treatment. in the mice treated with gentamicin or the mix, cox- <dig> expression level returned to the normal level nine hours after the treatment .

to verify whether the mix affected granulocytic infiltration in the kidneys of infected mice, hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed. as expected, kidneys of control mice displayed granulocytic infiltration within the lumen of the cortical convoluted tubules and hence lymphocytic infiltration, vessel activation and glomerular hyperplasia . instead, kidneys of mix-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in the number of granulocytic cells localized in the cortical convoluted tubules, less glomerular hyperplasia, and no lymphocyte infiltration .

in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of the mix for the period of  <dig> days
to test the antimicrobial activity of the mix in vivo for a longer period, mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose  of staphylococcus epidermidis and then treated with the mix. four groups of mice  were infected with the bacterial strain . one group of mice did not receive any treatment ; a second group received sterile pbs  ; the third group received the mix ; the fourth group received gentamicin . pbs, mix and gentamicin were administered intravenously in three boosts  <dig>   <dig> and 9 days post infection. in the placebo and the control groups, the bacterial load of kidneys and spleens  increased progressively, while the load was significantly lower in the groups treated with gentamicin or the mix. eleven days after the infection, the mice treated with gentamicin were still infected, while those treated with the mix were already sterile .

four days after the infection, in addition to spleen and kidneys , the bacterium was also detected  in the liver . thus, the mix is slightly more effective than gentamicin . in all four groups, bacteria were no longer detected in the blood circulation within 2 h from infection .

in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy of the mix for the period of  <dig> days
to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the mix, the expression levels of the tnf-α, ifn-γ, il- <dig> cytokines genes were measured in the kidneys. the experiment was carried out on the same four groups of mice described in the previous paragraph. for this purpose, the expression levels of the cytokines were measured  <dig> and 48 hours after each treatment with mix . in the group treated with the mix, compared to the group treated with gentamicin, the tnf-α and ifn-γ levels were under expressed  while the il- <dig> levels were over expressed  . this result suggests that the mix controls inflammation better than gentamicin.

discussion
recently we demonstrated that new antimicrobials are more effective than traditional antibiotics against staphylococcus epidermidis <cit> . the present study extends these results, providing evidence that the mix – a mixture of a royal jellein modified at the c-terminal  and an analogue of temporin b  – is a valid alternative to the use of gentamicin against skin infections caused by staphylococcus epidermidis.

in vivo, endogenous antimicrobial peptides  are known to be pleiotropic: they act as antimicrobials  <cit> ; neutralize bacterial components , which otherwise would induce an excess of inflammation and tissue damage  <cit> ; attract inflammatory cells to the wound site and promote wound healing.

the two exogenous components of the mix also behave in a pleiotropic fashion: they control the bacterial load , inhibit the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and control the expression of cox- <dig> , the acute phase proteins  and the expression of the cd <dig> receptor . at the histological level, the mix reduces kidney lymphocyte infiltration .

mice infected with a sub-lethal dose of staphylococcus epidermidis and three days later treated with the mix , within 11 days from treatment, displayed sterile kidneys and spleen – the organs targeted by the bacterial strain used in this study . samples collected at 15 min intervals from infection showed that bacteria leave the blood circulation within 2 h . these results are clinically relevant since they suggest that the mix can potentially be used in humans, where infection is generally caused by a small initial inoculum and treatment is therefore initiated several days after infection .

the mix is not toxic for eukaryotic cells, in vitro and in vivo ; its components act synergistically  and becomes moderately hemolytic . in addition, the mix reduces the synthesis of no2- in cells infected with staphylococcus epidermidis . these additional properties make the mix a candidate for a new generation drug.

in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the mix down regulates the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf−α and ifn-γ while enhancing the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  this effect is comparable to that of gentamicin, a well-known antimicrobial drug. these results confirm that the mix, in addition to an antibacterial activity, also exerts – in vivo and in vitro - an anti-inflammatory activity.

the intestinal flora represents a defense barrier against pathogens  <cit> . we therefore also investigated whether the mix spared probiotic bacterial species in vitro. while gentamicin killed the totality of the probiotics tested , the mix killed a minority of each bacterial species  .

the influence of the mix on the major cell signaling pathways was also studied. cd <dig> and cox- <dig> warn about the cell exposure to inflammatory stimuli  <cit> . the mix reduced the expression level of cox- <dig>  and cd <dig> , proofing that the mix exerts also anti-inflammatory activity. the cd <dig> levels are high in the mice infected. in the mice infected and then treated with mix at both  <dig>   <dig> and 9 hours from treatment, levels of cd <dig> are reduced . this last result provides evidence that the mix has effects on mechanisms of both innate and adaptive immunity.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provided evidence which suggests an analogy between endogenous amp and the mix, consisting of exogenous and chemically modified amps. both display a two-fold role, rapidly recognizing the presence of a pathogen and preventing an excess of inflammation.
