BACKGROUND
substantial evidence supports the concept that adult health and physiology are influenced by environmental factors during the gestational and infant stages of development  <cit> . the developmental origins of health and disease  hypothesis proposes that such programming may be contributing to the increasing prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases in recent decades  <cit> . programming can be initiated even during the periconceptional period: the preimplantation embryo has proven sensitive to environmental perturbation mediated through maternal diet or in vitro culture, with concomitant postnatal dysfunction of cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural systems  <cit> . whether other aspects of periconceptional maternal health  can induce long-term programming has not yet been explored in detail.

inflammation is associated with the release of potent cellular mediators ) which communicate at autocrine and paracrine levels. such mediators alter and regulate homeostasis and may modify the developmental environment. maternal infection and inflammation during mid- to late gestation affects offspring behaviour  <cit> , immunity  <cit> , metabolic status  <cit>  and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis functioning  <cit> . little is known about the postnatal sequelae of maternal inflammation during the periconceptional period, although an association with an increased risk of schizophrenia has been reported  <cit> . in this study, we established an in vivo mouse model of maternal periconceptional systemic inflammation  by lipopolysaccharide  administration on the day of zygote formation.

we found that the maternal lps challenge induces a typical and transient sickness response and, critically, altered developmental programming with abnormal blastocyst cell lineage allocation and led to postnatal changes in behaviour, adiposity and, following innate immune challenge, in cytokine release. our study therefore establishes that maternal sickness at the time of conception, or immune response conditions associated with it, can have lifelong consequences on offspring health, thereby extending the concept of dohad. moreover, our data show for the first time that the responsiveness of the innate immune system in an adult mammal is subject to environmental conditions originating at the time of conception.

RESULTS
maternal inflammatory response
intraperitoneal administration of lps  into dams at gestational day   <dig>   induced a typical sickness response, including associated metabolic and behavioural changes . one hour after treatment lps-injected mice displayed reduced open-field activity, including a 90% to 95% reduction in jumping activity  and increased time spent resting  . at  <dig> hours post-lps injection, food consumption was reduced at all doses  , as was water consumption at the  <dig> and  <dig> μg/kg lps doses.

 . thereafter food and water consumption were unchanged between treatment groups . body weight at  <dig> hours was reduced by  <dig> % to  <dig> % in an lps dose-dependent manner  . body weight was similarly reduced at  <dig> hours   but returned to control levels by  <dig> hours . a selection of the  <dig> cytokines detected by multiplex assay in maternal serum at  <dig> to  <dig> hours posttreatment is shown in figure 1d, and the remaining cytokines are shown in figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  serum concentrations of most cytokines peaked at three hours post-lps treatment, with the  <dig> μg/kg lps dose resulting in a three- to fivefold increase in il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  eotaxin, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α  . greater increases were seen at three hours in il- <dig> p <dig> , monocyte chemoattractant protein  <dig>   and regulated upon activation, normal t-cell expressed and secreted  . at  <dig> hours, most cytokine levels from lps-treated groups were similar to those of controls; however, some levels remained elevated , whilst others were decreased  .

embryo recovery and blastocyst cell number
the effect of maternal lps administration on preimplantation embryo development was assessed at gd  <dig> . maternal lps had no effect on total number of embryos recovered or the proportion that were blastocysts . however, blastocysts from all lps treatments had reduced inner cell mass  cell numbers  . trophectoderm  cell numbers were unaffected, except in the  <dig> μg/kg lps group  . total blastocyst cell numbers were increased in the  <dig> μg/kg lps group  and reduced in the  <dig> μg/kg lps group  . such alterations in cell numbers resulted in reduced icm:te cell ratios in blastocysts from all lps treatments  .

gestation, litter size and offspring growth
gestation length, male:female ratio, mean birthweight and litter size were all unaffected, except for increased litter size in the  <dig> μg/kg lps group  . the mean weekly body weights of male and female offspring from birth to  <dig> weeks were unaffected .

offspring behaviour
integration of all weekly data  into mean lifetime open-field activities showed that  <dig> μg/kg lps males displayed reduced numbers of jumps and rears  , but no differences in distance travelled or time spent resting . mean lifetime open-field activities of female offspring were unaffected . when open-field activities were examined on a weekly basis , male offspring from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams reared less than controls at weeks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , while female offspring from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams reared less than controls only at week  <dig> . in addition, male offspring from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams jumped less than controls at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> , and rested longer at week  <dig> . no differences between treatments were observed for females in number of jumps or time spent resting, and distance travelled was not different between treatments for males or females . differences were independent of maternal origin and gestational litter size.

offspring systolic blood pressure
integration of weekly measurements  into a 'lifetime' mean showed that systolic blood pressure  was not different, except in male offspring from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams, in which mean lifetime spb was increased compared with controls  . on a weekly basis, male offspring from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams displayed increased sbp at weeks  <dig> and  <dig> compared with controls  .

offspring body composition
analysis of tissue:body weight ratios and body mass index  showed that compared with controls, male offspring from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams had a 28% increase in inguinal fat:body weight ratio  , a 29% increase in retroperitoneal fat:body weight ratio   and a 7% increase in bmi  , but no differences in any organ:body weight ratio . in contrast, females showed no treatment group differences in fat pad:body weight ratio, bmi  or any organ:body weight ratio , except for liver:body weight ratio, which decreased by 12% in the  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dam group  . all differences were independent of maternal origin and gestational litter size.

offspring serum cytokine profile
offspring response to an innate immune challenge was assessed by measuring serum cytokine concentrations in lps-injected  adult offspring of dams that were injected with saline or  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg/kg lps at the zygote stage. a selection of the  <dig> cytokines detected by the multiplex assay is shown in figure  <dig>  the remaining cytokines are shown in figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  at  <dig>  hours post-lps injection, male and female offspring of lps-treated dams had severely blunted serum levels of several cytokines compared with controls. notably, the cytokine response of challenged offspring was either blunted in a maternal lps dose-dependent fashion or not altered; in no case did maternal lps treatment enhance offspring response. challenged males from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams  had blunted levels of il-1α  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor  , while those from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams  had blunted levels of mcp- <dig> , il-1α, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  g-csf, mip-1β  and rantes  and those from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams  had blunted levels of il-1α, il- <dig> , il-1β, il- <dig>  mcp- <dig>  mip-1β and rantes . challenged females from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams had a serum cytokine profile similar to that of controls. in contrast, challenged females from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams had blunted levels of il-1β, il- <dig> p <dig>  g-csf, keratinocyte-derived chemokine , mcp- <dig>  mip-1α, mip-1β, rantes and tnf-α  and those from  <dig> μg/kg lps-treated dams had blunted levels of il-1β, il- <dig> p <dig>  g-csf, kc, mcp- <dig>  mip-1α , il-1α, il- <dig>  rantes and tnf-α .

offspring serum corticosterone
in addition to serum cytokines, serum corticosterone concentration was quantified in lps-injected offspring from each maternal treatment group . serum corticosterone concentration of lps-injected offspring was unaffected by maternal treatment .

discussion
we have established an in vivo mouse model of mpsi by intraperitoneal administration of increasing doses of lps on the day of zygote formation  and found developmental programming to be significantly altered. we report that mpsi changes blastocyst cellular organisation and induces a complex postnatal phenotype affecting adult behaviour, adiposity and response to an innate immune challenge in a gender-specific manner that is dependent upon the originating maternal lps dose. these findings provide new insight into both the breadth of environmental cues that early embryos are sensitive to and the range of long-term adult physiological systems that are modulated as a consequence.

maternal response to lps
initially, we confirmed induction of an inflammatory response in lps-injected dams. lps treatment caused metabolic and behavioural changes typically associated with an inflammatory response, including reduced locomotor and exploratory activity, reduced food consumption and body weight, and increased circulating cytokine and chemokine levels. long-term changes to offspring phenotype are known to result from a periconceptional maternal low-protein diet  <cit> . it could therefore be argued that the indirect effect of reduced food consumption might be the critical inductive event changing the adult phenotype. we believe this not to be the case, since  maternal food consumption was transiently reduced by an equivalent amount in all lps groups, whilst changes in offspring phenotype were lps dose-dependent;  reduction in maternal food consumption was temporally equivalent in all lps groups, that is, maternal food consumption in all lps groups returned to control levels at an equivalent rate;  maternal serum cytokine levels, a more direct measure of the inflammatory response, were lps dose-dependent, corresponding with the resultant changes in offspring phenotype; and  maternal diet-induced programming is distinct from that reported here and affects particularly postnatal growth and cardiovascular function  <cit> .

maternal lps effect on blastocysts
administration of lps, including the low dose, on the day of zygote formation caused a reduction in gd  <dig>  blastocyst icm cell numbers and icm:te cell ratios. reduced rodent blastocyst cell numbers have been induced by maternal protein undernutrition and in vitro culture and are associated with disease-related changes in postnatal physiology  <cit> . similarly, mouse blastocyst cell numbers have been shown to be altered in response to maternal nutrition over a wider range  <cit> . our current findings thus support the concept that altered blastocyst proliferation and lineage allocation may be useful early markers for diverse forms of developmental programming whetherlater effects on foetal and postnatal growth are induced  or not . we also observed increased te cell numbers coinciding with increased litter size only in the  <dig> μg/kg lps group. this may reflect a 'trophic' effect mediated by a moderate release of inflammatory mediators, since cytokines and related signalling molecules are also important factors that are active during blastocyst development and implantation  <cit> . a greater degree of intrauterine growth restriction may have been exerted by the larger litter size in this low-dose lps group and may explain the raised sbp  seen here.

maternal lps effects on offspring phenotype
our most important finding is that mpsi results in long-term, gender-specific changes to offspring phenotype that are associated with a clear maternal lps dose dependency. male offspring from dams treated with the highest lps dose displayed reduced locomotor and exploratory open-field behaviour, increased mass of specific fat pads, increased bmi and a blunted serum cytokine response to innate  immune challenge. male offspring of the dams injected with the lower lps doses  were much less affected, as were female offspring, which only showed the blunted serum cytokine response to lps challenge. notably, but not statistically significantly, the locomotor and exploratory behaviour of female offspring followed the same pattern as that of the males, suggesting that female behaviour is affected by mpsi, but to a lesser extent, such that programming of offspring behaviour may be graded rather than dictated by gender. gender-specific differences in offspring phenotype have commonly been observed in dohad-related studies  <cit> , but the underlying mechanisms are not understood yet. interestingly, gender differences are evident in the preimplantation embryo from conception. for example, male embryos develop more rapidly than female embryos  <cit>  and consequently may have different sensitivities to distinct environmental conditions that could thus contribute to the breadth of the postnatal outcomes discussed in this section}.

the combined postnatal phenotype, observed especially in male offspring of mothers that were injected with the high lps dose, of reduced locomotor activity, increased adiposity and blunted cytokine response to lps challenge may represent diverse manifestations from one or more causative pathways. the open-field behavioural assay has been effective in identifying broader conditions of ill health in mice, including cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction  <cit> , but provides symptomatic information rather than mechanistic insight. the adiposity and bmi outcomes are similar to those found in an earlier study where  <dig> μg/kg lps administration to rat dams at midgestation caused central obesity, metabolic syndrome, hyperphagia and altered hpa functionality, but no change in blood pressure or lean body mass, in predominantly male offspring  <cit> . a similar offspring phenotype can result from administration of key inflammatory  or anti-inflammatory  mediators during midgestation  <cit> .

maternal lps effect on offspring innate immunity
a novel finding of our study is that mpsi resulted in adult offspring with a severely blunted serum cytokine response to innate  immune challenge. the blunting was most pronounced in offspring of dams treated with the highest lps doses, and, unlike most phenotypic changes in this study, it affected both male and female offspring. this blunted response was prominent in cytokines and chemokines  typically produced by cells of the monocyte lineage , whereas cytokines of the lymphocyte lineage  were less affected. interestingly, shanks et al.  <cit>  showed that exposure of neonatal rats to low-dose lps protected them from adjuvant-induced arthritis in later life, suggesting a blunted response to infection and inflammation, in accordance with the findings of the present study.

physiologically, the inflammatory response is controlled at a number of levels in a context- and cell-specific manner  <cit> ; however, major mechanisms include immunosuppressive signalling via gc pathways, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors , regulatory t cells , alterations in toll-like receptor  sensing and/or signalling pathways and epigenetic modifications  <cit> . interestingly, altered expression of gc receptors  and ppars has been found in offspring born to mothers fed a protein-restricted diet  <cit> , and increased tregs have been found in cord blood from neonates born to farm-exposed mothers  <cit> . thus, several pathways with the potential to regulate inflammation are known to be susceptible to programming influences. in the present study, production of the major rodent gc, corticosterone, was unaffected by mpsi, indicating that the blunted offspring cytokine response was not due to altered gc production. furthermore, gcs possess broad immunosuppressive activity, whilst the blunting observed in this study predominantly affects innate cytokines. taken together, these data support a mechanism that affects innate immune cells specifically, for example, altered tlr signalling and/or epigenetic modifications to cytokine promoters. other aspects of offspring immune status await investigation.

the blunted cytokine response to lps challenge is reminiscent of the endotoxin tolerance  phenomenon, wherein transient hyporesponsiveness to endotoxins  follows an initial sublethal exposure  <cit> . however, the long-lasting intergenerational phenotype of mpsi is distinct from et. crucially, et is not a state of total unresponsiveness, because lps signalling in endotoxin-tolerant cells induces antimicrobial effector functions without concomitant expression of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in this way, the host is protected from a deleterious and potentially fatal cytokine storm  whilst maintaining antipathogen defences . in animals, host tolerance has been studied far less extensively than resistance; however, the importance of tolerance strategies for host survival and host-pathogen interactions is becoming increasingly known  <cit> . at a physiological level, we therefore view the current findings as evidence for a novel form of adaptive response  <cit>  whereby maternal experience can lead to an increased level of postnatal tolerance which, within an anticipated pathogen-rich environment, would protect the offspring from the cytotoxic effects of their own frequent inflammatory responses. cytokine hyporesponsiveness in et is thought to be regulated at least in part by epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> , just as metabolic responses are evident in diet-mediated developmental programming  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying the blunted cytokine response in the current intergenerational model will be the subject of future research.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified for the first time that a maternal periconceptional inflammatory response acts as a mediator of developmental programming to preimplantation embryos. this environmental cue not only alters the cellular organisation of the blastocyst but also leads to permanent, gender-specific changes in adult offspring behaviour, adiposity and innate immune reactivity. adult offspring are hyporesponsive to inflammatory stimuli which may confer host protection from inflammation-associated tissue damage. these findings in an animal model extend the repertoire of environmental conditions that preimplantation embryos are sensitive to and substantiate the need for broader analysis of underlying molecular mechanisms and applicability across species, including humans.
