BACKGROUND
aβ accumulation is considered to be a hallmark of alzheimer’s disease  and responsible for synaptic deficits and neuronal degeneration in ad  <cit> . although ad is considered to be a result of aberrant aβ production  <cit> , the underlying mechanisms of how aβ deposition contributes to neuronal damage remain unclear. nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing α <dig> subunits  regulate development, differentiation, cognition and pathophysiology of the central nervous system  <cit> . in hippocampus, the highest levels of α7-nachrs are most commonly found on gabaergic interneurons  <cit> , suggesting their potential role in modulating the physiology of the hippocampus, an area of the brain implicated in learning/memory.

accumulating lines of evidence indicate that α7-nachrs are involved in ad pathology, and suggest possible pathophysiological links between aβ and nachrs. wang et al.  <cit>  first reported high affinity binding of aβ1- <dig> and aβ1- <dig> to α7-nachrs. two other groups subsequently reported direct and functionally-relevant interactions of aβ1- <dig> with α7-nachrs  <cit> . thereafter, several groups, including ours, reported the effects of aβ on α7-nachrs  <cit> . although some reports demonstrate an activating effect of aβ on heterologously transfected and native nachrs  <cit> , most in vitro studies show an inhibitory effect of acute application of aβ to neural model preparations including native α7-nachr expressing cells in culture, in brain slices, or transfected cell-line with α7-nachrs  <cit> .

recent findings have demonstrated that neuronal circuits exhibit hyper-excitation rather than hypo-excitation in both ad patients and model animals  <cit> . given that α7-nachrs expressed on hippocampal interneurons are inhibited by aβ, a disruption of these cholinergic inputs to hippocampal interneurons may not only affect neurotrophic support to these interneurons and cause neuronal degeneration, but may also cause disinhibition of pyramidal neurons in hippocampus and lead to neuronal network hyper-excitation due to a disrupted homeostatic regulation  <cit> .

in our previous studies, we discovered a novel type of heteromeric α7β2-nachr in rodent basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that is sensitive to aβ, implying that α7β2-nachrs might be a critical target for ad pathogenesis  <cit> . in the present study, we extend our previous work to investigate whether or not this heteromeric α7β2-nachr is also expressed in hippocampal gabaergic interneurons and to determine its sensitivity to pathologically relevant concentration of aβ oligomer by utilizing electrophysiological, histological and genetic engineering approaches. our findings suggest the existence of functionally heteromeric α7β2-nachrs in hippocampal gabaergic interneurons and these α7β2-nachrs are sensitive to low nanomolar concentrations of aβ oligomer.

RESULTS
functional α7-containing nachrs in hippocampal ca <dig> interneurons
to identify hippocampal gabaergic interneurons, tissue was punched from ca <dig> and the cells were acutely dissociated and selected based on their morphology. as shown in figure  <dig>  unlike pyramidal neurons, the typical hippocampal interneurons display bipolar or multipolar configurations  and relatively rapid spontaneous action potential firings . figure 1bb shows that  <dig> mm choline  induced a typical inward current from a hippocampal interneuron  and non-interneuron  acutely dissociated from ca <dig> area. to confirm that the recorded neuron was gabaergic, biocytin was microinjected through the pipette solution and followed by immunostaining with streptoavidin  and gad  <dig> antibody .

nicotinic receptor α <dig> and β <dig> subunits are co-expressed and co-assembled in mouse hippocampus
to test the possibility that nachr α <dig> and β <dig> subunits are co-expressed and co-assembled in hippocampus, we performed co-immunoprecipitation  assays using nachr α <dig> and β <dig> subunit-specific antibodies. the specificity of these antibodies has been described previously  <cit> . protein extracts from wild type or β <dig> knockout mice hippocampus or vertical diagonal band  tissues  were subjected to immunoprecipitation   with a rabbit anti-nachr α <dig> subunit antibody  followed by immunoblotting  with a rat anti-nachr β <dig> subunit monoclonal antibody . as indicated in figure  <dig>  the β <dig> subunit was readily detected immunologically in anti-α <dig> immunoprecipitates from either hippocampus or vdb in wild type mice but not from hippocampus in β <dig> knockout mice under the same experimental conditions . reprobing the same blot with the rabbit anti-α <dig> antibody  verified that similar amounts of α <dig> subunits were precipitated from both hippocampus and vdb tissues of wild type mice . collectively, considering the fact that both α <dig> and β <dig> subunits are mostly expressed on hippocampal interneurons  <cit> , these results suggest that nachr α <dig> and β <dig> subunits are very likely co-assembled in mouse hippocampal interneurons.

determination of aβ forms
in this study, afm was used to monitor aggregation forms of aβ. aβ was dissolved in distilled water to a concentration of  <dig> μm and then diluted to desired concentrations. preparations of aβ at  <dig> nm  contained small oligomers , small and large oligomers  and large oligomer and protofibriles  in afm images.  <dig> nm aβ at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hr after preparation mostly form smaller oligomers. in all experiments within this study, aβ was used within  <dig> hr before discarded.

although afm is able to distinguish oligomer from fibril or monomer  based on their sizes, it can not specify the exact forms of oligomer during the aggregation state. to examine what forms of aβ peptides were present in our samples, we utilized electrophoresis to test the exact forms of oligomer during aggregation state. as shown in figure 3g, after  <dig> hrs aggregation of aβ, if dissolved with water, the major form is  <dig> mer, while the major form of dmso dissolved aβ after  <dig> hrs aggregation remains in the monomer state.

pharmacological profiles of functional α7*-nachrs in hippocampal ca <dig> interneurons
pharmacological approaches were used to characterize and compare features of functional nachrs expressed in hippocampal ca <dig> interneurons and in ventral tegmental area  dopamine  neurons since vta da neurons are known to express homomeric α7-nachrs  <cit> . the α7-nachr-selective antagonist methyllycaconitine  showed similar antagonist potency toward choline-induced currents in either hippocampal ca <dig>  interneurons or vta da neurons . analysis of concentration-inhibition curves by preincubation with mla for  <dig> min  yielded ic <dig> values and hill coefficients of  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  for hippocampal interneurons  and  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  for vta da neurons , respectively. however, the β2*-nachr-selective antagonist dhβe was ~500-fold more potent as an inhibitor for choline-induced current in hippocampal interneurons  than that in vta da neurons . ic <dig> values and hill coefficients for dhβe-induced inhibition were  <dig>  μm and  <dig> , for hippocampal interneurons , and > <dig> μm and  <dig>  for vta neurons , respectively. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that functional α7*-nachrs on hippocampal interneurons likely contain dhβe–sensitive β <dig> subunits.

aβ inhibits α7β2-nachrs expressed on acutely dissociated hippocampal interneurons
to test the sensitivity to aβ of α7-nachrs in hippocampal interneurons, we examined the effects of  <dig> nm aβ1- <dig>  on these receptors. the experimental protocol involved repeated, acute challenges with  <dig> mm choline spaced at a minimum of 2-min intervals. during a continuous exposure to  <dig> nm aβ1- <dig> starting just after an initial choline challenge and continuing for  <dig> min, responses to choline challenges were progressively inhibited with time by  <dig> nm aβ1- <dig> in hippocampal interneurons, although reversibly as demonstrated by response recovery after  <dig> min of peptide washout . by contrast, exposure to  <dig> nm scrambled aβ  had no effect . choline-induced currents in dissociated vta da neurons were not sensitive to  <dig> nm aβ oligomeric treatment . concentration-response profile shows that choline-induced currents in hippocampus ca <dig> interneurons were more sensitive to block by aβ  compared to those in vta neurons . quantitation of three replicate experiments of  <dig> cells  confirmed that aβ, even at  <dig> nm concentration, specifically inhibits putative α7β2-nachr function on hippocampal gabaergic interneurons, but not the function of homomeric α7-nachrs on vta da neurons.

aβ inhibits choline-induced responses on acutely dissociated hippocampal gad-positive interneurons prepared from gfp-gad knock-in mice
to confirm the effect of aβ on identified gabaergic interneurons in hippocampus, we examined aβ’s effect on gfp-expressing cells acutely dissociated from hippocampus of gad67-gfp knock-in mice . as shown in figure 6ad, dissociated gabaergic neurons could be easily identified since they exhibited green fluorescence. we then examined and compared the effects of  <dig> nm scrambled aβ or  <dig> nm oligomeric aβ on  <dig> mm choline-elicited currents in the identified gabaergic neurons. choline was repetitively exposed to recorded neuron with an interval of  <dig> min . results from quantitative analysis indicate that choline-induced currents in identified gabaergic neurons are sensitive to  <dig> nm aβ exposures . these data support our findings that putative α7β2-nachr expressed in hippocampal gabaergic interneurons are sensitive to nanomolar level of oligomeric aβ.

discussion
principle findings
the α7-nachr is traditionally thought as a homomeric receptor  <cit> . however, we have previously demonstrated the existence of a novel, heteromeric α7β2-nachr in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, and the α7β2-nachrs exhibit high sensitivity to acute aβ exposure  <cit> . in this study, we asked whether the heteromeric α7β2-nachrs are also expressed in hippocampal gabaergic interneurons and whether these receptors are sensitive to pathological levels of aβ. we found that hippocampal gabaergic interneurons natively express functional α7β2-nachrs that are highly sensitive to pathologically-relevant concentrations of aβ. these findings suggest that aβ could disrupt cholinergic input to hippocampal interneurons to impair neuronal network, which suggests a profound role of these α7β2-nachrs expressed in hippocampus.

α7*-nachrs are predominantly expressed in hippocampal interneurons
there are long-standing disagreements and controversy about the expression profiles of α7-nachrs in hippocampal neurons. for example, some groups found expression and function of α7-nachrs in ca <dig> pyramidal neurons from acutely or organotypically cultured hippocampal slices  <cit> , whereas others reported that interneurons, rather than pyramidal neurons, in acute hippocampal slices preferentially express functional nachrs  <cit> . in the current study, we utilized enzyme dissociation approach to isolate individual neurons from hippocampus ca <dig> region. after enzyme dissociation, we found that most interneurons express functional α7-nachrs , however only a small population of pyramidal neurons express functional α7-nachrs with less discernable choline-induced whole-cell currents . consistent with above findings  <cit> , our data suggest that functional α7-nachrs are preferentially expressed in ca <dig> interneurons. thus, the use of acutely dissociated interneurons to evaluate the alteration of α7-nachr function after acute aβ exposure in the present study is appropriate.

aβ interacts with α7*-nachrs in hippocampal interneurons
aβ accumulation and aggregation in neuritic or senile plaques and severe, selective cholinergic neuronal deficits are two characteristic hallmarks of ad  <cit> . many previous findings suggest direct and functionally-relevant interactions of aβ with α7*-nachrs  <cit> . studies of aβ effects on α7-nachr function have been seemingly contradictory, perhaps due to differences in experimental protocols used in aβ studies and variables such as peptide concentrations and forms. many recent studies show that aβ directly modulates α7-nachr function  <cit> , and most of these findings, including ours, suggest that acute aβ exposure directly inhibits α7-nachr function. oligomeric aβ modulates neuronal function more dramatically than monomeric aβ  <cit>  and has more toxic effects  <cit> . in the present study, we utilized afm to monitor the aβ morphology during its aggregation. combined with afm, electrophoresis was used to examine what exact forms of aβ peptides were present in our samples. we found that after  <dig> hr aggregation of aβ, if dissolved with water, the major form was 9-mers in our samples. nanomolar aβ concentrations  are thought to be most pathologically relevant based on levels found in ad patients and in animal models of disease  <cit> . aβ oligomers  were used in the present study and this concentration is relevant to pathological levels of aβ in ad brains. the current findings are consistent with our previous observations that functional α7β2-nachrs are expressed on native neurons and they are sensitive to  <dig> nm aβ   <cit> , while the similar concentration of aβ likely does not affect homomeric α7-nachr function in vta da neurons. together, these results suggest that α7β2-nachrs are sensitive targets of effects of aβ exposure.

roles of α7-nachrs in ad pathogenesis and therapy
significant loss of radioligand binding sites corresponding to nachrs has been consistently observed at autopsy in a number of neocortical areas and the hippocampus of patients with ad  <cit> . losses in α7-like-nachr radioligand binding sites have been reported in several brain regions of ad patients  <cit> . decreases in numbers of radioligand binding sites corresponding to α7-nachrs are among the earliest events detected in ad, preceding cholinergic marker and neuronal loss  <cit> . anti-cholinergic signaling is known to impair memory, and nicotine exposure improves cognitive function in ad patients  <cit> , supporting crucial roles for cholinergic signaling and nachrs in cognitive function. activation of nachrs moderates aβ toxicity, for instance, stimulating nachrs inhibits amyloid plaque formation in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , activates α-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein   <cit> , increases ach release, facilitates aβ internalization  <cit> , inhibits activity of the mapk/nf-κb/c-myc pathway  <cit> , reduces a production and attenuates tau phosphorylation  <cit> . these findings suggest that signaling through nachrs not only is involved in cognitive function, but also involved in the pathogenic processes in ad.

hippocampal interneurons have a crucial role in regulating the complex interactions between pyramidal cells and represent a key to the understanding of network operations  <cit> . hippocampal interneurons have been reported to highly express α7-nachrs  <cit> , implying an important role played by α7-nachr in hippocampal function. aβ and α7-nachr are both detected in hippocampus in ad patients and amyloid precursor protein  transgenic mice  <cit> , accompanied with prevalent loss of hippocampal neurons  <cit> . previous findings suggest that acute exposure of hippocampal neurons to high concentrations of aβ  inhibits α7-nachr function  <cit> . in the present study, we found that exposure with physiologically relevant concentrations  of aβ oligomers can significantly inhibit α7-nachr-mediated currents. we think that use of the single neuron preparation and aβ1- <dig> oligomers may cause this difference of sensitivity. recent evidence demonstrates that neuronal circuits in hippocampus exhibit hyper-excitation rather than hypo-excitation in both ad patients and app transgenic animals  <cit> . palop et al. reported an aberrant neuronal hyper-excitation in app over-expressing mice models  <cit> . it has been reported that the activation of α7-nachrs expressed on ca <dig> interneurons enhances inhibitory postsynaptic currents  in the postsynaptic ca <dig> pyramidal neurons and that these inhibitory responses were blocked by the α7-nachrs-selective antagonist mla  <cit> . furthermore, the activation of α7-nachrs expressed on ca <dig> interneurons produced gabaergic inhibition in nearby pyramidal neurons  <cit> . thus, blockade of α7-nachrs expressed on ca <dig> interneurons may lead to disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, while reduced or impaired cholinergic innervations will tune down gabaergic inhibition from gabaergic interneurons to pyramidal neurons  <cit> . thus, disruption of cholinergic input to hippocampal gabaergic interneurons might cause disinhibition of pyramidal neurons in hippocampus and then lead to neuronal network hyperexcitation with further deficit in ad.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings suggest that functional α7β2-nachrs are expressed in hippocampal gabaergic interneurons, and these receptors are sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of oligomeric aβ. the inhibition of α7β2-nachrs in gabaergic neurons by pathological levels of aβ may cause acute disruption of cholinergic signaling on interneurons, disinhibition of principal cell types , and ultimately deficits of learning and memory abilities  <cit> . moreover, the inhibition of α7β2-nachr function in interneurons by oligomeric aβ could also lead to a loss of trophic support for these neurons and accelerate the progression of ad. drugs targeting α7β2-nachrs to protect them against aβ effects or restoration of α7β2-nachr function may be a new therapeutic strategy for ad treatment.
