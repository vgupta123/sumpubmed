BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infects a wide range of animal hosts and typically causes a self-limiting gastroenteritis  <cit> . initial symptoms include nausea and vomiting, which are followed by abdominal pain and diarrhoea. s. typhimurium adheres to intestinal epithelial cells using a myriad of fimbriae including type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . outer membrane proteins such as the plasmid-encoded rck  <cit>  and the ompd  <cit>  protein also mediate attachment to epithelial cells. deletion of either rck or ompd results in decreased invasion of intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . upon adhesion the subsequent uptake of salmonella into mammalian cells is a complex process that is coordinated by a series of proteins that are encoded within the spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> pathogenicity islands  <cit> . the spi- <dig> locus encodes a type three secretion system , also known as an invasasome, that delivers effector protein including the salmonella outer proteins  sope, sope <dig>  sopb, the secreted protein tyrosine phosphatase sptp, and the salmonella invasion proteins , sipa and sipc into cells  <cit> . these effectors have profound effects on the regulation of actin cytoskeletal structure and on mammalian cell membrane plasticity  <cit> . the net result of injecting these effectors into the host cell is bacterial-promoted endocytosis  <cit> .

the phopq system regulates the transcription of a multitude of virulence genes of salmonella  <cit> . this regulatory system is composed of the phoq membrane-bound sensor kinase and the phop response regulator. in response to specific stimuli, phoq modifies the phosphorylation state of the cytoplasmic dna-binding protein phop, increasing its affinity for specific dna targets  <cit> . genes that are phop-activated are known as pags  whilst those that are repressed are known as prgs   <cit> . three different cues have been proposed to activate the phopq system inside macrophages: a mild acidic ph, antimicrobial peptides, and low mg2+ concentration  <cit> . the pagn gene is a phop-activated gene  <cit> . the pagn orf was originally identified in a tnphoa random-mutagenesis screen of the s. typhimurium strain 14082s  <cit> . in that study bacteria with active phoa gene-fusions that displayed decreased fusion-protein activity on acquisition of the phop <dig> allele  were identified. through the use of in vivo expression technology , heithoff et al. identified over  <dig> genes that were specifically expressed during infection of balb/c mice  <cit> . these authors showed that pagn , although not expressed in s. typhimurium strains grown on typical laboratory medium, was required for survival in balb/c mice under the conditions of the ivet selection. subsequently, conner et al. noted a decrease in competitiveness for a mutant with deletions in the region of pagn/ivivi-a when mixed with its parental strain  <cit> . expression of the pagn gene has been shown to respond to ph and mg2+ concentration in vitro  <cit> . as with other pags, and in a phop-dependent manner, pagn expression was induced in conditions of acidic ph and low mg2+ concentration. furthermore, expression of pagn has been demonstrated to be highly up-regulated within cultured raw <dig>  macrophages and henle- <dig> enterocytes  <cit> .

whilst the function of pagn is unknown it does display similarity to known invasins of escherichia coli. pagn is ~54% similar to the hek and tia adhesins/invasins of pathogenic e. coli  <cit> . based on this homology it is possible that pagn may be an adhesin and/or invasin. here we show that pagn, when expressed in e. coli, can agglutinate erythrocytes as well as mediate adhesion to and invasion of mammalian cells. furthermore s. typhimurium mutants defective in pagn display reduced adhesion to and invasion of mammalian cells. finally, multi-copy expression of pagn can compensate for the loss of the spi- <dig> encoded t3ss.

RESULTS
pagn is a haemagglutinin but not an autoagglutinin
the hek protein from e. coli k <dig> strain rs <dig> agglutinates erythrocytes in a heat-resistant manner  <cit> . pagn and hek are ~54% similar, indicating that pagn may also promote erythrocyte agglutination. to test this hypothesis, a microtitre haemagglutination  assay was performed as described in methods. e. coli k- <dig> strain xl- <dig> blue containing the pagn expression-vector pml <dig> or the empty vector control, ptrc99a, were incubated with human erythrocytes. the expression of pagn conferred upon recombinant e. coli the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes . using 3% human blood, a bacterial ha titre of  <dig> was displayed by pagn-expressing e. coli, similar to that of e. coli expressing hek . hek is a heat-resistant agglutinin; heating hek-expressing cells to 70°c does not reduce agglutination activity  <cit> . we sought to determine if pagn was also a heat-resistant agglutinin. unlike hek, pagn displayed a decrease in ha titre after heating . thus pagn is a heat-sensitive agglutinin.

in addition to promoting haemagglutination hek is also an autoagglutinin  <cit> . autoagglutination can be conveniently measured in a kinetic manner by a spectrophotometric assay. expression of the hek protein from phek <dig> in e. coli xl- <dig> blue caused bacteria to settle out of solution at a rate of  <dig>  od <dig> nm units/min whereas bacteria expressing pagn settled at rate of  <dig>  od <dig> nm units/min almost identical to that of the vector control strain. thus, e. coli expressing pagn did not support autoagglutination.

next we sought to establish if pagn could support haemagglutination when expressed in multicopy in s. typhimurium. plasmid ppagn <dig>  was introduced into s. typhimurium lt- <dig> and cultured in minimal mops medium. growth in this medium leads to maximal induction of the phop-dependent pagn promoter. expression of pagn was confirmed by sds-page analysis of outer membrane extracts . surprisingly s. typhimurium/ppagn <dig>  did not mediate agglutination of red blood cells . laboratory strains of e. coli such as k- <dig> or b completely lack the o antigen component of lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . it has been reported that porins in e. coli are partially obscured by the lps core and completely blocked by o antigen sugars  <cit>  and indeed in s. typhimurium the o antigen prevents the outer membrane pgte protease from interacting with its substrate  <cit> . s. typhimurium has a large o antigen, which may serve to mask pagn thus limiting access to its receptor. to investigate this hypothesis, the plasmid ppagn <dig>  was transformed into s. typhimurium strain ch <dig>  a gale mutant. the gale gene encodes the enzyme udp-galactose 4-epimerase which is the first enzyme catalyzing o antigen biosynthesis. therefore s. typhimurium strain ch <dig> lacks the o antigen component of lps. haemagglutination assays using this strain showed that pagn, when over-expressed in a rough strain, was capable of promoting agglutination . these data suggest that lps is capable of 'masking' pagn and preventing functional receptor binding during haemagglutination.

pagn is an adhesin and invasion
given that pagn has similarity to both the tia and hek invasins we determined if pagn could mediate adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells. e. coli dh5α harboring either ptrc99a or pml <dig> were induced with iptg and incubated with cho-k <dig> cells. to enumerate the number of invading bacteria, a gentamicin protection assay was performed. approximately 60% of pagn-expressing bacteria invaded the cho-k <dig> cells. indeed, bacteria that expressed pagn were 27-fold more invasive than bacteria harboring the vector control plasmid .

invasion of epithelial cells by bacteria is often accomplished by inducing cytoskeletal rearrangements by manipulating polymerisation of actin. actin filaments have a fast and slow growing end; cytochalasins inhibit elongation at the fast growing end  <cit> . specifically, cytochalasin d affects the polymerisation of actin in two ways: it increases the initial rate but markedly reduces the final extent of the mg2+-induced polymerization process  <cit> . to assess the role of actin filament polymerization in pagn-mediated invasion, confluent cho-k <dig> monolayers were pre-incubated with cytochalasin d  for  <dig> min at 37°c before infection with bacteria. cytochalasin d was present throughout the invasion assay. treatment with this inhibitor lead to a 30-fold reduction in invasion, which was comparable to the level seen with the vector control in the absence of cytochalasin d .

whilst cho-k <dig> cells provide an accessible and convenient model for studying host-pathogen interactions they do not wholly emulate the human gut; more realistic cell culture models are used to study salmonella-gut interactions, for example ht- <dig> intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . e. coli strain dh5α containing the pagn expression plasmid pml <dig> or the vector control ptrc99a were incubated with confluent ht- <dig> monolayers. approximately 1% of the bacteria expressing pagn bound to the eukaryotic cells as determined by a cell association assay . this figure was 6-fold greater than the vector control. of the bound bacteria that expressed pagn, ~2% had invaded the cell monolayer. no detectable invasion of ht- <dig> cells by the vector control was observed. thus, pagn promotes adhesion to ht- <dig> cells and low level invasion of these cells.

pagn contributes to salmonella adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells
a pagn mutant strain ml <dig>  was constructed as described in methods. this mutant was verified by pcr  and the lack of pagn expression in the outer membrane of strain ml <dig> was verified by immunoblotting . this mutation could be complemented by expressing pagn from plasmid pml <dig>  . the lack of pagn had no effect on the growth of s. typhimurium with both wild-type sl <dig> and pagn mutant strain ml <dig> having doubling times of ~ <dig> min in mm  <dig>  minimal media. after overnight culture in this medium these bacteria grew to a similar extent having optical densities of ~ <dig>  od <dig> nm. some pag gene products such as pagl have been associated with modification of lps  <cit> . we thus compared the lps profiles of sl <dig> to ml <dig>  and lt- <dig> to mlt- <dig>  . in each case there was no difference between the lps profile of the wild-type and mutant.

the contribution of pagn to the invasion of cho-k <dig> cells by s. typhimurium strain sl <dig> was determined. invasion promoted by s. typhimurium strain sl <dig> and its pagn mutant derivative, ml <dig>  were tested with non-polarized cells in a standard invasion assay. these data established that wild-type s. typhimurium strain sl <dig> were internalized in significantly greater numbers than the pagn mutant strain ml <dig>  data from triplicate wells revealed that wild-type levels were reduced from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for a pagn mutant . the pagn-defective bacteria displayed a consistent ~2-fold reduction in cho-k <dig> cell invasion as compared to the wild-type parent.

adhesion to the ht- <dig> cell line by s. typhimurium strain sl <dig> and adhesion-defects due to the absence of the pagn protein in strain ml <dig> were investigated. standard cell association assays were performed comparing the levels of cell association displayed by wild-type and pagn-defective s. typhimurium . wild-type bacteria were recovered in higher numbers compared to pagn-defective bacteria . complementation of the pagn mutation with the pagn-containing multi-copy plasmid pml <dig> increased cell association to 10-fold greater than that exhibited by wild-type s. typhimurium.

furthermore, the pagn mutant strain ml <dig> in comparison to sl <dig> displayed a five-fold reduction in invasion of ht- <dig> cells . the overall levels of invasion in all cases were low since the bacteria were cultured in mm  <dig>  medium. cultivation in this medium results in maximal expression of pagn but the expression spi- <dig> system is greatly reduced  <cit> . the decrease in invasion due to the loss of pagn could be complemented to wild-type levels with plasmid pml <dig>  the introduction of pml <dig> into strain ml <dig> resulted in a 10-fold increase in adhesion over wild-type levels . however, a corresponding 10-fold increase in invasion levels by pml10/ml <dig> was not observed. this may be due to saturation of the host cell functions that pagn might use to induce invasion. in summation pagn can contribute to adherence and to low level invasion in the two cell lines tested by s. typhimurium sl <dig> 

haemagglutination by salmonella expressing pagn was only observed in rough strains . this was not the case for adherence to or invasion of mammalian cells since we could observe defects in these phenotypes for pagn mutants in the smooth s. typhimurium strain sl <dig>  nevertheless we examined if a rough strain might facilitate enhanced invasion and/or adhesion by pagn. in these studies we made use of strain ch <dig> a rough mutant of s. typhimurium lt- <dig> . a pagn rough mutant strain, ml <dig>  displayed approximately a five-fold decrease in cell association which was greater than the defect due to loss of pagn in smooth strains . the magnitude of the decrease in cell association in pagn rough mutants was similar to that seen for the loss of the spi- <dig> encoded t3ss by mutating inva in strain ml <dig>  moreover, there was no additive effect of deleting both pagn and inva. intriguingly, loss of both pagn and inva in strain ml <dig> could be complemented by introducing the pagn multicopy plasmid ppagn <dig> . indeed, the level of cell association for ppagn <dig> /ml <dig> was greater than that of ch <dig> 

discussion
the pagn gene is widely distributed throughout the salmonella  <cit>  and confers a competitive advantage in vivo  <cit> . however, the function of pagn is unknown. deletion of the salmonella enterica subspecies i-specific centisome  <dig> genomic island  leads to decreased association with human cells  <cit> . we have observed that the pagn protein is located in the outer membrane of s. typhimurium. together with its similarity to the hek and tia invasins/adhesins we postulated that it might serve a similar role in s. typhimurium. when ectopically expressed in e. coli k- <dig>  pagn could mediate haemagglutination in a manner similar to that observed for the hek protein. in contrast to hek, pagn is not a heat-resistant agglutinin and does not promote autoagglutination. this suggests that the folding of pagn is sensitive to heating and that this affects its biological activity. whilst hek and pagn are similar proteins it is likely that this similarity is restricted to the conserved membrane spanning regions of the proteins. hek is predicted to have eight membrane-spanning regions and four exposed extracellular loops  <cit> . a similar arrangement is likely for pagn . the second extracellular loop of hek is absolutely required for autoagglutination  <cit> . the corresponding sequence in pagn is markedly different with only nine identical residues out of thirty . thus it is likely that pagn does not have the requisite sequence for bacterial cell:cell interactions. furthermore, loop  <dig> of hek is absolutely required for haemagglutination  <cit> . obviously the amino acid sequence of loop  <dig> of hek renders it resistant to heating whereas the corresponding sequence in pagn is different and this may underpin its heat-sensitivity . interestingly, the tia protein is also highly divergent at this sequence location .

pagn failed to promote haemagglutination when overexpressed in s. typhimurium lt <dig>  this inability to promote haemagglutination may be explained by the differences between the lps of e. coli laboratory strains and s. typhimurium strain lt <dig>  laboratory strains of e. coli such as k- <dig> and b completely lack the o antigen component of lps  <cit>  whereas s. typhimurium has a large o antigen containing oac, abe, man, gal, and glc. when over-expressed in the rough s. typhimurium strain ch <dig>  pagn promoted haemagglutination. pagn contains fifteen positively charged amino acids that we predict to be surface-exposed. it is likely that these amino acids might interact with negatively charged lps thus masking pagn and preventing interactions between the protein and its mammalian target.

expression of pagn in e. coli resulted in adhesion to and invasion of mammalian cell lines. high levels of invasion promoted by pagn were observed for cho-k <dig> cells. invasion of ht- <dig> cells by e. coli expressing pagn was much lower. it may be that the receptor for pagn is less abundant in ht- <dig> cells, expressed by fewer cells or possibly that the receptor is not as accessible in this cell line. another possibility may be that the bacterial cells do not survive within the environs of ht- <dig>  ht- <dig> is known to produce antibacterial peptides and these are deleterious for e. coli. ht- <dig> cells express human beta defensin  <dig>  <cit>  and also up-regulate expression of ll- <dig> in response to e. coli  <cit> . a similar difference in the efficiency of invasion of cho-k <dig> cells versus the t <dig> intestinal epithelial cell line was previously noted for the hek protein  <cit> .

mutation of pagn in s. typhimurium resulted in a decrease in invasion of and adhesion to cho-k <dig> and ht- <dig> cells. indeed, this defect was more pronounced for rough strains. though mutation of pagn did not completely abrogate adhesion and invasion the magnitude of the effect is of the same order as that seen for ompd  <cit>  and rck proteins  <cit> . thus outer membrane proteins such as pagn may play an incremental role in salmonella interactions with host cells. the pagn gene is activated by phop and is maximally expressed intracellularly as observed by gene fusion  <cit>  or microarray analysis  <cit> . thus bacteria that exit epithelial cells or macrophages might be expected to have an optimal level of expression and this might facilitate subsequent interactions with mammalian cells that the pathogen encounters. the fact that pagn can functionally substitute for the lack of a functional t3ss may have biological relevance. within macrophages the spi- <dig> t3ss is strongly downregulated  <cit>  and salmonella that exit such cells may have to rely on pagn to facilitate subsequent interactions with cells until such time as the t3ss is maximally expressed.

the primary sequence of pagn has similarity to the tia and hek adhesions/invasins. both tia and hek bind heparin sulphate proteoglycan   <cit> . studies are currently in progress to establish if pagn utilizes hspg for adhesion/invasion.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that pagn can mediate interactions with mammalian cells when expressed in e. coli and s. typhimurium. pagn is upregulated in vivo and contributes to the competitiveness of s. typhimurium. this may be due to the adhesive and invasive characteristics of pagn. pagn in multicopy can complement an inva mutation. pagn may thus prove to be a useful tool for studying salmonella in the intracellular environment in the absence of the spi- <dig> t3ss.
