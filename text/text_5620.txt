BACKGROUND
hepatitis e virus  is a positive sense, non-enveloped single-stranded rna virus with a genome of  <dig>  kb and can be grouped into at least four genotypes  <cit> . hepatitis e virus was considered to be restricted to developing countries, but it is now considered an emerging pathogen in developed countries . the epidemiology of hev, however, differs between developed and developing countries  <cit> . in developing countries all four genotypes of hev are found in locally acquired hepatitis e cases, whereas in developed countries locally acquired hev cases are caused by genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . hev infections with genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are implicated in both epidemic and sporadic cases of hev infection, whereas genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> have been only implicated in sporadic cases so far. sources for these sporadic cases in industrialized countries are uncertain. the absence of person-to-person transmission of hev genotype  <dig> among  <dig> household members of acute hepatitis e patients in the netherlands  <cit>  suggests that human hev infections acquired in the netherlands are of environmental origin rather than person-to-person transmission. worldwide, hev has been reported in environmental sources, including surface water  <cit> , animal species including domestic pigs and wild boar  <cit> , sewage of animal origin  <cit> , and foods of animal origin  <cit> . zoonotic foodborne hev transmission via wild deer meat has been proven  <cit> , but not from other environmental sources. an increased anti-hev seroprevalence in people working professionally with pigs  <cit>  and presence of infectious hev in commercial porcine livers at retail  <cit>  however, suggests that swine may be a source of human exposure to hev. based on the phylogenetic similarity between hev-sequences from human and swine, interspecies transmission was suggested  <cit> .

in the netherlands, about  <dig>  ×  <dig> fattening pigs are raised annually  <cit> . hev rna was observed in faeces from >50% of dutch fattening pig farms  <cit>  and hev has a high transmission potential among domestic swine  <cit> . therefore, domestic swine may be an important reservoir for human hev infections, but to which extent is currently unknown. to be able to estimate the public health risk using field data on the occurrence of hev in pigs, the natural course of hev infection in pigs needs to be known. several studies have presented experimental data for intravenously  inoculated pigs, showing onset of faecal hev rna excretion at one to two weeks postinoculation and onset of viremia at two to three weeks postinoculation  <cit> . faecal hev rna excretion may last up to  <dig> weeks, whereas viremia is detected generally for one to three weeks  <cit> . faecal hev rna excretion is observed in all pigs after iv inoculation, but viremia and antibody development are not observed in all iv inoculated pigs. antibodies to hev infection are detected between two and eight weeks postinoculation  <cit> . increased liver enzyme levels in serum are generally not observed in iv inoculated pigs  <cit> .

however, whether iv inoculated pigs display a course of hev infection that resembles that of naturally infected pigs  is currently unknown. direct oral inoculation of hev in pigs has been unsuccessful in all but one pig  <cit> . this pig received a dose of at least  <dig> hev genome equivalents , whereas two other pigs that received this dose remained uninfected. contact-exposure of a susceptible pig with an infectious pig appears to lead to hev infection more easily than direct oral inoculation  <cit> . thus, the use of contact-infected pigs may be a good alternative to study the course of hev infection for naturally infected pigs. contact-infected pigs are likely to reflect the natural course of hev-infection more accurately than iv inoculated pigs.

the aim of the current study was to describe the course of hev infection in contact-infected pigs by estimating the time until and the duration of faecal hev rna excretion and viremia and the time until antibody development. localization of hev in the pig and liver enzyme levels in serum were also assessed. as iv inoculated pigs were used to generate first-, second- and third-generation contact-infected pigs  <cit> , the data for contact-infected pigs were compared to those for iv inoculated pigs to identify possible differences in the course of infection due to infection route.

RESULTS
statistics describing the course of hev infection
the time until and the duration of faecal hev rna excretion and viremia, and the time until antibody development were estimated for contact-infected and iv-pigs . no statistical differences were observed between c1-pigs and c2/3-pigs , and therefore data for all contact-infected pigs were pooled. statistical differences between the two blocks were observed for the five parameter estimates. statistical differences were observed between contact-infected pigs and iv-pigs for two parameters in both blocks, whereas one parameter differed significantly between contact-infected pigs and iv-pigs in one block only . to conclude whether an overall difference between contact-infected pigs and iv-pigs existed, joint p-values were calculated. overall differences were observed for time until onset of faecal hev rna excretion and viremia, and duration of faecal hev rna excretion.

statistical differences were absent among c1-, c2- and c3-contact infected pigs for these five parameters, for which the data for contact-infected pigs were pooled.

from the first faecal hev rna excretion onwards, the course of the hev rna-titre in faeces and serum, and the development of detectable antibodies were similar for iv-pigs and contact-infected pigs .

ast and alt levels in serum
no instant elevations in serum alt- or ast-levels were observed for the seven contact-infected pigs and five iv-pigs when the values obtained were related to the baseline values for fattening pigs . however, the presence of an increasing trend was assessed per pig by ordinary linear regression, showing a statistically significant  increase in serum alt-levels during the period of faecal hev rna excretion for one contact-infected pig necropsied  <dig> days after first faecal hev rna excretion and for three iv-pigs . the differences in minimum and maximum values for these pigs were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> u l- <dig>  the other  <dig> pigs did not show an increasing trend for alt-levels and none of the pigs for ast-levels.

hev rna in tissues, urine and bile
five c2-pigs and five iv-pigs were necropsied at  <dig> days post infection to collect tissue samples, urine and bile . hev rna was found less often in samples of c2-pigs  than in samples of iv-pigs . remarkably however, urine of three c2-pigs tested hev rna-positive , as opposed to none of the iv-pigs. sequences of the rt-pcr fragments were obtained for the three samples by cloning and sequencing, and were homologous to the inoculated hev strain.

at  <dig> dpi, hev rna was detected in urine, the bronchial and hepatic lymph nodes and the spleen of both iv-pigs. furthermore, hev rna was present in the faeces of one of the two pigs, the other showed hev rna in the ileum, jejunum and the mesenteric lymph node. the c1-pig necropsied at  <dig> days after first faecal hev rna excretion showed hev rna in the kidney and the c1-pig necropsied at  <dig> days showed hev rna only in urine. interestingly, both urine specimens of the iv-pigs and one urine specimen of the c1-pig contained hev rna at necropsy. the urine specimen of the iv-pigs both showed a ct > <dig>  whereas the specimen of the c1-pig showed a ct of  <dig> . this c1-pig had stopped excretion of hev in faeces about  <dig> weeks earlier. clones with correct inserts were obtained for rt-pcr fragments detected in urine of the c1-pig. subsequent sequencing showed homology to the hev sequence of the inoculated strain.

hev rna in muscle samples
hev rna was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> biceps femoris muscle samples, in  <dig> of  <dig> iliopsoas muscle samples and in  <dig> of  <dig> longissimus muscle samples at various time-points after infection . muscle samples were found positive in contact-infected pigs up until  <dig> days after first faecal hev rna excretion. out of  <dig> liver-positive pigs,  <dig> tested positive in at least one muscle sample , while five out of six liver-negative animals tested negative in all muscle samples. in addition, hev rna was detected in examined serum samples in all but one pig  that showed hev rna-positive muscle samples.

histopathology
no gross pathological changes were observed in any of the examined pigs. by histopathology, moderate, multifocal, lymphohistiocytic hepatitis was observed in livers from two of five c2-pigs  and three of five iv-pigs  after necropsy at  <dig> days postinfection. in addition, slight subepithelial lymphohistiocytic cell infiltrations were observed in the gall bladder of one c2-pig and one iv-pig necropsied at  <dig> days post infection, and of one c1-pig necropsied at  <dig> days after first faecal hev rna excretion. in the ileum a mild or moderate hyperplasia of peyer's patches was observed in four of four examined c2-pigs, four of four examined iv-pigs and three of four pigs necropsied at the end of the study. a mild or moderate hyperplasia in lymph nodes was observed in one c2-pig , two iv-pigs  and the c1-pig necropsied  <dig> days after first faecal hev rna excretion. no lesions were observed in the spleen and pancreas.

discussion
in the current study, hev infection in pigs due to contact-exposure to hev-infectious pigs was studied as model for natural transmission to describe the natural course of hev infection in pigs. the use of intravenous hev inoculation as initiator of the transmission process enabled collaterally the identification of differences in the course of infection due to infection route. furthermore, hev rna was detected in several porcine tissues, muscles and excreta.

we present evidence of hev rna in urine in the current study, with  <dig> of  <dig> urine samples containing hev rna compared to  <dig> of  <dig> faecal samples collected at the same time. a single observation of hev rna in urine of a pig was reported before by banks et al.  <cit> . because urine samples in the current study were collected directly from the bladder using a sterile syringe with needle, contamination by hev from other sources is unlikely. one hev rna-positive urine sample was obtained from a contact-infected pig at  <dig> days after onset of faecal hev rna excretion, showing a comparable ct to that of faecal samples collected during the acute phase of infection. this finding may suggest that hev-excretion via urine lasts longer than faecal hev rna excretion, and/or that urinal hev-excretion occurs at a later stage of infection. this issue should be resolved by monitoring longitudinally the presence of hev in urine of contact-infected pigs.

the presence of hev rna in urine suggests that hev may be transmitted via urine. until now, faecal-oral transmission of hev is considered the main transmission route among pigs. the possibility of other transmission routes has been discussed  <cit> , but efforts to experimentally transmit hev between pigs via tonsil and nasal secretions, and hev-contaminated needles have been unsuccessful  <cit> . the physical condition of urine yields easier distribution of hev throughout a pen or stable than with faeces. in addition, the amount of urine excreted per pig per day is 5-fold the amount of excreted faeces  <cit> . transmission of hev via urine might occur orally, or aerogenically via droplet aspiration to the respiratory tract. for urine to be a transmission route, however, the hev rna should originate from infectious hev particles, which is currently unknown. the detected hev rna may represent hev that is bound to antibodies for disposal; anti-hev antibodies have been observed in urine samples of human hepatitis e patients  <cit> . whether or not urine contains infectious hev could be examined by performing cell infection experiments  <cit>  or experimental inoculation of susceptible pigs with a hev-positive urine sample.

hev rna was detected in samples from organs and muscle. these samples may contain hev rna either extrinsically  due to cross-contamination during necropsy or intrinsically . during necropsy, the organs containing excreta  that can harbour high loads of hev were sampled last to reduce the potential for extrinsic contamination. although the contribution of these excreta cannot be excluded entirely, the most likely source for extrinsic contamination is blood. this reasoning holds especially for the muscle samples, as these were taken outside of the abdominal cavity before any other organ sample was collected. indeed, eight of nine examined pigs with hev-contaminated muscle samples were viremic, suggesting a potential role of blood in contamination. whether this role involves intrinsic and/or extrinsic contamination remains to be examined, for instance by immunohistochemistry  <cit> .

more than 50% of the muscle samples examined in the current study contained hev rna. previously, hev rna was detected in skeletal muscle in pigs that were inoculated iv with hev of genotype  <dig> obtained from a human patient, but not with hev from swine  <cit> . the muscle samples examined in the current study were proxies for commercial pork meat . positive samples were found until four weeks after onset of faecal hev rna excretion, which suggests that hev rna-contaminated meat could only enter stores when new hev-infections occur later in the fattening period. for japanese pig farms it was estimated that about 5% of the pigs were infected after five months of age  <cit> . in a dutch slaughterhouse, 14% out of  <dig> sampled pigs excreted hev faecally, suggesting these pigs were in the acute phase of infection . from a public health perspective, it should be considered whether contaminated pork meat at retail indeed contains infectious hev and what fraction remains infectious until consumption. it is advisable, however, to cook pork properly prior to consumption.

in the current study, the course of hev infection in pigs was described for contact infected pigs. simultaneously, these data were collected from iv inoculated pigs, enabling comparison between the two. the duration of faecal hev rna excretion was exceeded by about  <dig> days for iv-pigs compared to contact-infected pigs. in contrast, the delay in onset of faecal hev rna excretion was reduced by about  <dig> days for iv-pigs compared to contact-infected pigs. this reduction may, however, be partially explained by the required exposure-time for infection, which is absent in the estimate for iv-pigs. from the current transmission study, the rate of transmission per day was estimated at  <dig>    <cit> . the reciprocal of this figure gives the average exposure-time required for infection, which equals  <dig>   days. with the delay being  <dig>  days , the exposure time explains only partially the delay. the remainder may be explained by the difference in route of infection. other differences possibly attributable to route of infection were time until viremia and the higher number of hev rna positive organs in iv-pigs. the observed differences suggest a more severe infection after iv inoculated pigs compared to contact-infected pigs. whether these differences are important to consider in planning future experiments will depend on the aim. for instance, when using swine as a bioassay to detect infectious hev  <cit>  these differences will not be important, whereas in risk assessment studies the risks needs to be estimated as accurately as possible and the differences are important.

the hev titres in serum and faeces were similar between iv-pigs and contact-infected pigs in the current study once faecal hev rna excretion had started. meng et al.  <cit>  described that hev titres in faeces increased about  <dig> log <dig>  when the inoculated hev-dose increased  <dig> -fold. this relationship would suggest that the hev-doses for contact-infected pigs and iv-pigs in the current study were comparable and that contact-infected pigs ingested sufficient hev to result in about  <dig> hev rna particles entering the bloodstream. variation in ingested hev-doses, however, seems likely for contact-infected pigs, because their ingestion of hev was uncontrolled. if the doses differed, then similar hev titres for contact-infected and iv-pigs suggest a plateau level of hev released by infected cells. it has been hypothesized that hev-release from infected cells may be caused by the immunological response rather than the cytopathic effect of hev on hepatocytes  <cit> . in this perspective, the apparent plateau might reflect the maximal effect of the immune system. the current data, however, leave this issue unresolved.

antibody development was detected in the current study at the earliest at about two days after first faecal hev rna excretion. the average time until antibody development was two weeks after first faecal hev rna excretion  or inoculation . reported times until igg development for iv inoculated pigs were two weeks after inoculation at the earliest  <cit> , but more frequently reported are times between three and eight weeks postinoculation  <cit> . the difference between previous studies and the current study may be caused by the principle of the elisas used. in the current study, the double antigen sandwich elisa detects igm and iga in addition to igg. the igm antibody contains  <dig> antigen binding sites as opposed to two for igg, for which the likelihood to bind at least one immobilized antigen and one conjugated antigen is higher for igm than for igg, as discussed by rutjes et al. . as the onset of igm generally precedes the onset of igg after infection, total antibody development is likely detected earlier than igg development only. this advantage could be used in e.g. seroprevalence screening to minimize misclassification of the subject due to the delay in antibody development.

histopathological lesions were observed in the liver, gall bladder, ileum and lymph nodes of hev-infected pigs in the current study. four pigs showed an increasing trend in ast and alt levels, which might suggest a slowly progressive development of liver damage during hev-infection. due to absence of control pigs in the current study these abnormalities cannot be attributed conclusively to the hev-infection. however, mild hepatic lesions were previously associated with subclinical hepatitis e in naturally infected pigs  <cit>  and experimentally infected pigs  <cit> . therefore, a subclinical hev-infection in domestic pigs may initiate energy-requiring recovery processes, possibly at the expense of production aspects such as growth rate, feed conversion or time to first estrus. effects of hev-infections on litter size and preterm abortion in pregnant gilts were absent  <cit> , but effects on the above-mentioned production parameters have not been examined. this information is needed to evaluate from an economical perspective on whether intervention strategies for the reduction of the hev-incidence among pigs can be beneficial to pig farmers.

CONCLUSIONS
the course of hev infection in contact-infected pigs was characterized by estimation of onset and the duration of faecal hev rna excretion and viremia, time until antibody development, the course of ast/alt-levels and localization of hev in tissues and organs. hev rna was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> contact-infected pigs and may be a source for hev-transmission. furthermore,  <dig> of  <dig> meat samples contained hev rna, suggesting the possibility of foodborne transmission to humans via pork products. additional studies are required to assess whether urine and meat contain infectious hev and to assess the currently unknown public health risk by contact with pigs and by consumption of pork.
