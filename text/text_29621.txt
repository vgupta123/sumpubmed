BACKGROUND
dna methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications. in differentiated cells in higher animals, methylated cytosine is almost always followed by guanine, associating methylation of 60-90% of all cytosines in a cpg context  <cit> . although recent evidence showed that cytosine methylation in embryonic stem cells may also occur as cphpg and cphph   <cit> , genome-wide distributions of cytosine methylation in cphpg and especially in cphph have great variability between individuals, contrary to methylation in the cpg context, which demonstrates stable cell-type-specific methylation  <cit> . thus, cell-type-specific regulatory patterns most likely depend on methylation in the cpg context.

various methodologies have been developed to study dna methylation at different genomic scales  with direct sequencing of bisulfite-converted dna  <cit>  continuing to be the method of choice. however, the analysis of a single cpg site or a few cpg sites as surrogate indicators of dna methylation status of the surrounding region is the most prevalent strategy in epigenetic studies at different scales, due to the assumption of the relatively homogeneous distribution of dna methylation within genomic regions. this assumption is supported by multiple pieces of evidence of unmethylated cpgs closely co-located within cpg islands  and methylated cpgs in repetitive elements. in addition, the level of methylation of the hpaii sites  within cgis demonstrates a correlation with average cgi methylation levels  <cit> . at the same time, methylated cpgs have been found in unmethylated cgis  <cit> . it was also shown that a single differentially methylated cpg might affect transcription of the esr <dig> gene  <cit> . moreover, it was hypothesized that dna methylation of cpg-rich and cpg-poor regions might be involved in different regulatory programs  <cit> . in short, whether or not the distinct methylation status of a single cpg affects specific transcription-related functions remains an open question.

it is widely accepted that cytosine methylation is a crucial regulatory mechanism in both normal and pathological processes. dna methylation is involved in development  <cit> , cellular differentiation  <cit> , maintaining cellular identity  <cit> , pluripotency  <cit> , aging  <cit> , memory formation  <cit> , responses to environmental changes  <cit>  and reactions to diet  <cit> . several pathological conditions, including cancer  <cit> , diabetes  <cit> , alzheimer’s and parkinson’s diseases  <cit> , also show aberrant dna methylation. profiles of dna methylation can be inherited through cell division  <cit>  and in some cases through generations  <cit> . however, recent studies of dynamic dna methylation/de-methylation in vivo <cit>  challenge the conventional view that dna methylation is a permanent epigenetic mark and suggest the possibility of exploring dna methylation as a promising target for non-invasive therapies for diseases linked with aberrant methylation.

dna methylation of gene promoters is tightly associated to the repression of transcription, yet the mechanisms are still unclear  <cit> . in the last four decades, multiple studies have shown that the level of dna methylation in promoters is negatively correlated with the expression of downstream genes  <cit> . it was also hypothesized that ubiquitous, low-density cytosine methylation in vertebrate genomes can contribute to reduction of the transcriptional "noise" from inappropriate promoters  <cit> . recently, multiple pieces of evidence arguing against the paradigm that dna methylation always represses transcription have started to appear. transcription of some genes was found to be independent of methylation  <cit> . promoters with low cpg content are usually methylated, yet they still may be transcriptionally active  <cit> . although intergenic and gene terminal cgis are frequently methylated, they demonstrate a pervasive transcription  <cit> . sparse dna methylation of promoters may repress transcription, but this effect could be overcome by an enhancer  <cit> . genes exhibiting high levels of promoter methylation during normal development remain suppressed in dnmt1-deficient mouse embryos, suggesting that developmental gene control does not globally rely on cytosine methylation and that the effects of dna methylation are limited to specialized processes such as imprinting and mobile elements repression  <cit> . alternative promoter usage in different regions of the aged brain seems to be independent of promoter methylation  <cit> . promoter sequences are able to recapitulate correct dna methylation autonomously and demonstrate proper de novo methylation during differentiation in pluripotent cells independently of the transcriptional activity of corresponding downstream promoters  <cit> . furthermore, in some cases, methylation is required for activation of transcription and therefore is positively correlated with gene expression  <cit> .

despite the various controversies, evidence that dna methylation as an important step in regulation remains solid. the mechanisms of the interplay between methylation and expression are therefore critically important. it remains unclear whether dna methylation is the cause or the consequence of altered gene expression. if dna methylation causes gene repression, then there are several possible outcomes . cytosine methylation may directly affect the affinity of transcription factors  towards their binding sites   <cit> . non-systematic experimental evidence that dna methylation can prevent binding of some tfs to particular tfbss  <cit>  supports this hypothesis. for example, methylation of the e-box  prevents n-myc from binding to promoters of egfr and casp <dig> in a cell-specific manner  <cit> ; methylation of the yy1-binding site in the promoter of the peg <dig> gene represses the binding activity of yy <dig> in vitro <cit> . it is also worth noting that experimentally determined tfbss usually show low levels of dna methylation  <cit>  and that tf-tfbs recognition is often associated with the lack of methylation  <cit> . furthermore, certain positions within ctcf binding sites are more sensitive to methylation than are others  <cit> . methylated cytosine can also attract tfs, both activators  <cit>  and repressors  <cit> . methylation of the cre sequence enhances the dna binding of c/ebpα, which in turn activates a set of promoters specific for adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . methyl-binding domain  proteins bind methylated cpg dinucleotide and induce histone deacetylation, subsequent chromatin condensation and gene repression  <cit> .

the opposite scenario implies that chromatin modifications  <cit>  reduce the accessibility of tfs and the transcriptional machinery to gene promoters, therefore leading to gene repression. dna methylation in this model is not a cause, but a consequence of repression and serves to fix the repressed state of the chromatin . in this case, cytosine methylation accumulates passively as a consequence of the independent absence of tf binding  <cit>  or it appears as a result of direct dna methyltransferase recruitment by transcription repression proteins such as the polycomb group  protein ezh <dig>  <cit> . this model is supported by negative correlation of tf expression and average methylation of their tfbss  <cit> . besides, it was reported that binding of some tfs, including sp <dig> and ctcf, is sufficient for maintaining a local unmethylated state  <cit> . nevertheless, this scenario  does not explain the sensitivity of certain tfs to methylation of their tfbss.

in this study, we explore the evidence that supports one of these two scenarios. to achieve this, we first test whether methylation of a particular cytosine correlates with transcription. this effect may provide a basis for regulation of transcription through methylation of specific tfbss. second, we investigate whether some tfs are more sensitive than others to the presence of such cytosines in their tfbss and what features of tfbss can be associated with this sensitivity. to this end, we employed encode  <cit>  data on dna methylation obtained by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing   <cit> . rrbs allows us to identify both methylated and unmethylated cytosines quantitatively at a single base pair resolution in the ccgg context in regions with high densities of rarely methylated cytosines, usually co-located within gene promoters  <cit> . to evaluate genome-wide expression across different cell types, we used fantom <dig>  <cit>  data obtained by cap analysis of gene expression   <cit> . fantom <dig> provides quantitative estimation of expression in several hundreds of different cell types.

our study shows that a fraction of single cpgs within promoters exhibits a significant negative correlation of their methylation profiles with the expression profiles of neighboring transcriptional start sites  considered across various samples. moreover, we observe a strong negative selection against the presence of such cytosines within tfbss, especially in their core positions. interestingly, we find that repressors are more sensitive to the presence of such cytosines in their binding sites.

RESULTS
only a fraction of cytosines exhibits significant correlation between methylation and expression profiles of a corresponding tss
it is well known that the level of cytosine methylation of promoters is negatively correlated with gene expression  <cit> ; the role of methylation of particular cpgs in the regulation of gene expression has been demonstrated in the case of esr <dig>  <cit> . the crucial role of the location of methylated regions relative to tsss is also widely accepted. the question whether methylation of a particular cytosine may affect expression remains unanswered.

as the first step of this study, we studied whether the methylation level of a particular cytosine within a promoter region is correlated with the expression of the corresponding tss, since such cytosines may serve as a basis for the regulation of transcription through tf binding. table  <dig> demonstrates that among  <dig>  cytosines analyzed in the study, only  <dig> %  have significantly  negative or positive spearman correlation coefficients  between methylation and expression profiles of a closely located tss . this sheds different light on the common perception of a link between methylation and gene expression. we call cytosines demonstrating significantly negative scc

 cpg “traffic lights” . in this study, we mostly focus on such cytosines.

out of  <dig> cell types analyzed in this study,  <dig> were malignant. genome-wide dna methylation in cancer cells is dramatically different from that in normal cells . although we believe that the basic mechanism of interaction between dna methylation and expression should be the same in cancer and non-cancer cells, we repeated the experiments on the  <dig> normal cell types and obtained similar results : only a small fraction  of cytosines have significant  negative and positive scc
m/e
, respectively.

cage tags are often found within gene bodies  <cit>  and methylation of a gene body may have a positive correlation with gene expression  <cit> . it was also suggested that the cytosines within gene bodies are often not methylated  but hydroxymethylated   <cit> . however, bisulfite-based methods of cytosine modification detection  are unable to distinguish these two types of modifications  <cit> . the presence of 5hmc in a gene body may be the reason why a fraction of cpg dinucleotides has a significant positive scc
m/e
 value. unfortunately, data on genome-wide distribution of 5hmc in humans is available for a very limited set of cell types, mostly developmental  <cit> , preventing us from a direct study of the effects of 5hmc on transcription and tfbss. at the current stage the 5hmc data is not available for inclusion in the manuscript. yet, we were able to perform an indirect study based on the localization of the studied cytosines in various genomic regions. we tested whether cytosines demonstrating various scc
m/e
 are co-located within different gene regions . indeed, cpg “traffic lights” are located within promoters of gencode  <cit>  annotated genes in 79% of the cases, and within gene bodies in 51% of the cases, while cytosines with positive scc
m/e
 are located within promoters in 56% of the cases and within gene bodies in 61% of the cases. interestingly, 80% of cpg “traffic lights” are located within cgis, while this fraction is smaller  for cytosines with positive scc
m/e
. this observation allows us to speculate that cpg “traffic lights” are more likely methylated, while cytosines demonstrating positive scc
m/e
 may be subject to both methylation and hydroxymethylation. cytosines with positive and negative scc
m/e
 may therefore contribute to different mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. it is also worth noting that cytosines with insignificant  scc
m/e
 are more often located within the repetitive elements and less often within the conserved regions and that they are more often polymorphic as compared with cytosines with a significant scc
m/e
, suggesting that there is natural selection protecting cpgs with a significant scc

selection against tf binding sites overlapping with cpg “traffic lights”
we hypothesize that if cpg “traffic lights” are not induced by the average methylation of a silent promoter, they may affect tf binding sites  and therefore may regulate transcription. it was shown previously that cytosine methylation might change the spatial structure of dna and thus might affect transcriptional regulation by changes in the affinity of tfs binding to dna  <cit> . however, the answer to the question of if such a mechanism is widespread in the regulation of transcription remains unclear. for tfbss prediction we used the remote dependency model   <cit> , a generalized version of a position weight matrix , which eliminates an assumption on the positional independence of nucleotides and takes into account possible correlations of nucleotides at remote positions within tfbss. rdm was shown to decrease false positive rates effectively as compared with the widely used pwm model.

our results demonstrate  that from the  <dig> tfs studied here ,  <dig> tfs had a significant underrepresentation of cpg “traffic lights” within their predicted tfbss  and only one tf  had a significant overrepresentation of cpg “traffic lights” within the predicted tfbss. similar results were obtained using only the  <dig> normal cell lines:  <dig> tfs had a significant underrepresentation of cpg “traffic lights” within their predicted tfbss  and no tfs had a significant overrepresentation of such positions within tfbss . figure  <dig> shows the distribution of the observed-to-expected ratio of tfbs overlapping with cpg “traffic lights”. it is worth noting that the distribution is clearly bimodal with one mode around  <dig>   and another mode around  <dig>  . we speculate that for the first group of tfbss, overlapping with cpg “traffic lights” is much more disruptive than for the second one, although the mechanism behind this division is not clear.

to ensure that the results were not caused by a novel method of tfbs prediction , we performed the same analysis using the standard pwm approach. the results presented in figure  <dig> and in additional file  <dig> show that although the pwm-based method generated many more tfbs predictions as compared to rdm, the cpg “traffic lights” were significantly underrepresented in the tfbss in  <dig> out of  <dig> tfs studied here , supporting our major finding.

we also analyzed if cytosines with significant positive scc
m/e
 demonstrated similar underrepresentation within tfbs. indeed, among the tested tfs, almost all were depleted of such cytosines , but only  <dig> of them were significantly over-represented due to the overall low number of cytosines with significant positive scc
m/e
. results obtained using only the  <dig> normal cell lines were similar:  <dig> tfs were significantly depleted of such cytosines , while most of the others were also depleted, yet insignificantly due to the low number of total predictions. analysis based on pwm models  showed significant underrepresentation of such cytosines for  <dig> tfs and overrepresentation for  <dig> . interestingly, these  <dig> tfs all have highly at-rich binding sites with very low probability of cpg.

it was previously shown that cytosine methylation can prevent binding of several tfs  and, therefore, methylation may serve as a global regulatory mechanism for cell-specific tf binding. yet, we observe that most of tfs avoid cpg “traffic lights” in their binding sites, suggesting a potentially damaging effect of cpg “traffic lights” to tfbs and therefore a natural selection against tfbs overlapping with cpg “traffic lights”.

computational prediction of tfbss identifies dna regions of potential binding, which may not be available for a tf in a particular cell type due to chromatin modifications. to avoid a bias caused by potential tfbss that are not functional in particular cell types, we used experimentally obtained regions of tf binding. chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by parallel dna sequencing  is an effective experimental technique for the identification of regions for dna-protein interaction  <cit> . yet, regions where tfs most likely bind dna  in a particular cell type are relatively long, usually longer than several hundreds of base pairs, while real tfbss are on average a dozen base pairs long. therefore, we combined experimental and computational approaches and filtered out the predictions of tfbss outside of chip-seq peak regions. we tested our results on chip-seq data for ctcf as it is the only tf in encode with experimental binding information in as many as  <dig> cell types out of the  <dig> cell types we used in our study . results in additional file  <dig> support our initial finding: ctcf binding sites avoid cpg “traffic lights”. chip-seq data for other tfs are available only for the cancer cell lines included in our study, making it impossible to draw conclusions about normal cell functioning. at the current stage the chip-seq data for other tfs is not available for inclusion in the manuscript. our findings suggest that changing a tf’s affinity to dna or even blocking tf binding sites by direct and selective methylation is limited to certain tfbss within a few promoters and thus is not likely to be a general mechanism of methylation-dependent regulation of gene expression.

tfbss of repressors are especially sensitive to the presence of cpg “traffic lights”
overlapping of tfbs with cpg “traffic lights” may affect tf binding in various ways depending on the functions of tfs in the regulation of transcription. there are four possible simple scenarios, as described in table  <dig>  however, it is worth noting that many tfs can work both as activators and repressors depending on their cofactors. moreover, some tfs can bind both methylated and unmethylated dna  <cit> . such tfs are expected to be less sensitive to the presence of cpg “traffic lights” than are those with a single function and clear preferences for methylated or unmethylated dna.

there are four possible scenarios of interaction of dna methylation and tf functions:

 tf can bind unmethylated dna and cannot bind methylated dna. tf acts as a transcription activator. the methylation profile of cytosines within tfbs should be negatively correlated with tss expression.

 tf can bind methylated dna and cannot bind unmethylated dna. tf acts as a transcription activator. the methylation profile of cytosines within tfbs should be positively correlated with tss expression.

 tf can bind unmethylated dna and cannot bind methylated dna. tf acts as a transcription repressor. the methylation profile of cytosines within tfbs should be positively correlated with tss expression.

 tf can bind methylated dna and cannot bind unmethylated dna. tf acts as transcription repressor. the methylation profile of cytosines within tfbs should be negatively correlated with tss expression.

using information about molecular function of tfs from uniprot  <cit>  , we compared the observed-to-expected ratio of tfbs overlapping with cpg “traffic lights” for different classes of tfs. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of the ratios for activators, repressors and multifunctional tfs . the figure shows that repressors are more sensitive  to the presence of cpg “traffic lights” as compared with the other two classes of tfs , suggesting a higher disruptive effect of cpg “traffic lights” on the tfbss of repressors. although results based on the rdm method of tfbs prediction show similar distributions , the differences between them are not significant due to a much lower number of tfbss predicted by this method. multifunctional tfs exhibit a bimodal distribution with one mode similar to repressors  and another mode similar to activators . this suggests that some multifunctional tfs act more often as activators while others act more often as repressors. taking into account that most of the known tfs prefer to bind unmethylated dna, our results are in concordance with the theoretical scenarios presented in table  <dig> 

“core” positions within tfbss are especially sensitive to the presence of cpg “traffic lights”
we also evaluated if the information content of the positions within tfbs  affected the probability to find cpg “traffic lights” . we observed that high information content in these positions  decreases the probability to find cpg “traffic lights” in these positions supporting the hypothesis of the damaging effect of cpg “traffic lights” to tfbs . the tendency holds independent of the chosen method of tfbs prediction . it is noteworthy that “core” positions of tfbs are also depleted of cpgs having positive scc
m/e
 as compared to “flanking” positions , although the results are not significant due to the low number of such cpgs .

CONCLUSIONS
we found that the methylation profiles and expression profiles in  <dig> % of single cpg dinucleotides in cage-derived promoters were significantly negatively correlated with neighbouring tss, supporting the argument that single cytosine methylation is involved in the regulation of transcription. in a way, the current common perception of the link between methylation and gene expression is seen in a different light. unexpectedly, we observed a strong selection against the presence of cpg “traffic lights” within the tfbss of many tfs. we demonstrated that the selection against cpg “traffic lights” within tfbs is even more pronounced in the case of “core” positions within tfbss as compared to “flanking” positions. these observations allow us to suggest that blocking of tfbss by selective methylation is unlikely to be a general mechanism of methylation-dependent transcription regulation and that such a mechanism is limited to special cases. we conclude that the regulation of expression via dna methylation and via tf binding are relatively independent regulatory mechanisms; both mechanisms are thus not in a direct causal relationship. known cases of interaction between these mechanisms appear mostly because they operate on the same target regions  and require intermediate partners, for example, modification of chromatin.
