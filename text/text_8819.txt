BACKGROUND
lymphatic filariasis is caused by the thread-like parasitic nematodes wuchereria bancrofti, brugia malayi and b. timori which are transmitted by mosquitoes. b. malayi and b. timori are the main cause of brugian lymphatic filariasis in humans and b. pahangi causes filariasis in domestic cats, dogs and wild animals. the periodic form of b. malayi primarily infects humans whereas the sub-periodic form is zoonotic  <cit> . both b. malayi and b. pahangi have similar life cycles in their natural vertebrate and mosquito hosts. the adult worms of both species reside in the lymphatic vessels of infected vertebrates and, when mature, produce sheathed microfilariae that enter the blood stream. when a competent mosquito acquires microfilariae in a blood meal, the microfilariae develop within the mosquito into third stage larval forms that are infective to vertebrates.

the b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae are morphologically similar, but genetically these worms can be differentiated by restriction site polymorphism within specific regions of repeated dna sequences  <cit> . physiologically, both b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae are able to develop to infective stage larvae in anopheles quadrimaculatus and aedes aegypti  <cit> . however, only b. pahangi microfilariae are able to develop in and be transmitted to the vertebrate host by the natural vector, armigeres subalbatus, whereas most of the b. malayi microfilariae are rapidly and effectively destroyed in the hemocoel by melanotic encapsulation  <cit> . melanin synthesis in mosquitoes involves a series of complex biochemical reactions that are triggered in response to either injury to the insect body or by molecules on the surface of invading microbial pathogens  <cit> .

the antigens on the surface of b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae have been found to be similar, with antibodies raised against surface antigens of one species cross-reacting with surface antigens from the other species  <cit> . however, the protein profile of microfilaria surface antigens seen on sds-page analysis shows differences in molecular weight of some surface antigens, indicating that there are species-specific molecules on the b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae surfaces  <cit> . the two outer layers of the microfilariae, the sheath and cuticle, play an important role in host-parasite interactions and have been shown to contain carbohydrate epitopes on their surfaces  <cit> . immunochemical studies have shown that during b. malayi microfilariae maturation, the composition of the surface antigens changes and results in differences in mosquito infectivity between immature and mature microfilariae  <cit> . with regard to mosquito immunity, carbohydrate molecules and other pathogen-associated molecules located on the surface on invading pathogens are recognized by mosquito pattern recognition receptors in a species-specific manner and lead to the activation of mosquito defenses such as phagocytosis and melanotic encapsulation  <cit> . it is therefore possible that subtle differences in the carbohydrate or protein content of the b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae surface may be responsible for the species-specific melanotic encapsulation response of ar. subalbatus towards b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae. it is also a possibility that b. pahangi microfilariae secrete molecules that modulate the melanotic encapsulation response mounted by ar. subalbatus.

during the past decade, microarray analysis has paved the way for thorough studies of gene expression  <cit> . more recently, cross-species hybridization analysis has been used as a way to investigate differences between two closely related species  <cit> . in this study, we sought to determine the differences between b. pahangi and sub-periodic b. malayi microfilariae at the transcriptional level using cross-species microarray analysis. first, we identified the global molecular differences that exist between the transcriptomes of the microfilariae of these two species. second, we identified transcripts that are preferentially expressed in one species and whose products are likely to be secreted or located on the surface of the microfilariae. proteins that are secreted by microfilariae or located on their surface are likely to play a significant role in the interaction of microfilariae with their vertebrate and mosquito hosts.

RESULTS
sequence comparison between b. pahangi and b. malayi genes
we selected twenty-two nucleotide sequences of b. pahangi genes, complete or partial, deposited in genbank and compared their nucleotide sequences to their counterpart genes in b. malayi . the alignment results showed that, on average, b. malayi and b. pahangi genes had 97% nucleotide sequence identity. during cross-species microarray hybridizations, a sequence mismatch between the probe and the target sequence in one species can lead to inaccurate interpretations of target levels between the species. in this study, we sought to determine whether there were sequence differences between b. malayi and b. pahangi genes particularly in the sequence used as probes and spotted on the array. to this end, we randomly selected five b. malayi genes whose probes were present on the bmv <dig> array and designed primers that flanked the probe sequence. we carried out pcrs using these primers on b. malayi and b. pahangi genomic dna templates and sequenced the pcr products. the alignment results showed that the oligonucleotide sequence of the selected probes were a match for both the b. malayi and b. pahangi genes . in one case, the bm. <dig> probe derived from pub locus bm1_ <dig> appears to straddle an exon-intron junction as evidenced by the consensus dinucleotides found at each end of the intron, gt at the 5' end and ag at the 3' end of the intron  <cit> .

the partial or complete nucleotide sequences of twenty-two b. pahangi genes deposited in genbank were run on the ncbi's nucleotide blast program. the output of the blast analysis assigned to the corresponding b. malayi gene is shown above.

predicted localization of proteins encoded by preferentially expressed gene transcripts
the proteins coded for by the transcripts found to be preferentially up-regulated in b. malayi and b. pahangi were grouped according to whether they were secretory or non-secretory as indicated by the signalp  <cit>  predictions provided on the bmv <dig> array annotation. of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in b. pahangi microfilariae,  <dig> genes  coded for proteins containing a signal sequence on the n-terminus implying that these proteins associate with the secretory pathway while the remaining  <dig> genes  coded for proteins without a signal sequence. of the  <dig> proteins associated with the secretory pathway, targetp  <cit>  predictions indicate that  <dig> proteins are likely to be located in the mitochondria,  <dig> proteins are likely to be secreted and  <dig> have an unknown destination .

similarly, in b. malayi, signalp predictions on the bmv <dig> array annotation suggested that, of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in b. malayi microfilariae,  <dig> genes  coded for proteins that associate with the secretory pathway and the remaining  <dig> genes  were denoted as non-secretory because of the lack of a signal sequence on the n-terminus of the protein. of the  <dig> proteins associated with the secretory pathway, targetp predictions suggested that  <dig> proteins were likely to be localized in the mitochondria,  <dig> proteins were likely to be secreted and  <dig> had an unknown destination .

validation of microarray data by real-time pcr analysis
to verify the microarray data,  <dig> brugia genes were selected for real-time pcr analysis . the genes were selected based on the signal intensities of their probes, in either species, from the microarray data. five of the selected genes had higher signal intensities in b. pahangi, five in b. malayi and the remaining three had similar signal intensities in both species. first, it was important to identify a gene with equal transcript levels in both species that was to be use as an endogenous reference. to this end, primers were designed that amplified between 200- <dig> base pair fragments of the pub locus represented by the three probes, bm. <dig>  bmx <dig> and bmx <dig>  that showed similar signal intensities in the microarray data. real-time pcr analysis was performed using these primers on cdna derived from five biological samples of b. pahangi and b. malayi microfilariae with similar age distribution. of the three probes with similar signal intensities in both species on the microarray data, the bm. <dig> probe, which was derived from the pub locus bm1_ <dig>  was found to have a ct ratio closest to the value one, across all five biological samples . for this reason, bm1_ <dig> was assigned as the endogenous reference to which the remaining ten genes were normalized. the comparative ct method was used to determine preferentially expressed transcripts  <cit> . the brugia microfilaria samples used for real-time pcr were independent of those used in the microarray analysis. the comparison of real-time pcr data to that obtained in the microarray analysis showed the same trend and a strong correlation between the data obtained by the two methods using different biological samples , suggesting that the transcriptional profiles derived from the microarray data are accurate and reproducible.

discussion
this study was a cross-species comparison of gene transcription between the microfilariae of b. malayi and b. pahangi. the b. pahangi and b. malayi microfilariae used in this study were both obtained from similar micro-environments; the intra-peritoneal cavity of experimentally-infected jirds. therefore, it would be safe to assume that the difference in the transcriptional profile of each nematode species was intrinsic to each species and not due to micro-environmental influence.

in order to absorb any possible variation in microfilaria gene transcription between the two species due to the host immune responses or slight differences in microfilaria age distribution, independent biological samples of b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae were collected from eight pairs of jirds and used in this study. three paired biological samples were used for the microarray analysis and five paired biological samples, different from those used for microarray analysis, were used in the real time pcr analysis to confirm the validity of the microarray data. for the microarray analysis, there were  <dig> technical replicates for each of the  <dig> biological samples, resulting in the use of nine microarray slides. only those genes with similar signal intensity values across all nine microarrays, and by extension all  <dig> biological samples, were further analyzed and are shown on the gene lists. as a result, any influence on microfilaria gene transcription arising from subtle differences in microfilaria age distribution between the two species, immune pressure on the microfilaria by the vertebrate immune response, or artifacts of sample preparation was therefore greatly reduced.

the bmv <dig> array used in this study consisted of probes designed from b. malayi genomic gene models and ests. since the probes were an exact match for b. malayi genes and not necessarily proven to be so for the corresponding b. pahangi genes, one could assume that hybridizations on the bmv <dig> array would be biased towards b. malayi. sequence divergence in some genes, particularly a sequence mismatch within the oligonucleotides used as a probe, could influence the hybridization kinetics and result in misleading data with respect to a cross-species differential gene transcription comparison  <cit> .

in this study, we found that the b. pahangi genes with sequences deposited in genbank had a high sequence identity to their counterpart b. malayi genes. in addition, with respect to this study, we intentionally selected five probes on the bmv <dig> chip that had a b. malayi to b. pahangi signal intensity ratio between three to ten and were able to show that the sequence of these oligonucleotide probes matched the cognate regions on both the b. malayi and b. pahangi genes. in addition, the microarray data as a whole did not show any bias towards b. malayi in the total number of preferentially up-regulated gene transcripts. indeed, there were slightly more gene transcripts that were up-regulated in b. pahangi than in b. malayi microfilariae. these findings taken together suggest that b. pahangi and b. malayi may have almost identical gene sequences to the extent that it would be possible to obtain biologically meaningful gene transcription profiles of b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae using the bmv <dig> array with minimal bias toward b. malayi.

that said, it is possible that there are b. pahangi genes whose nucleotide sequence in the coding region differs slightly from that of their orthologs in b. malayi, hence introducing probe-bias towards b. malayi transcripts in a cross-species hybridization microarray analysis. for this reason, this study focused mainly on genes whose transcripts appeared to be preferentially up-regulated in b. pahangi microfilariae; a conservative approach bearing in mind that genes unique to b. pahangi and those with extensive mismatch between the probe and target cdna sequence may not have been detected in the microarray analysis.

the genes that were classified as up-regulated in either species were manually mapped into the kegg pathway groups. the composition of genes in some of the kegg pathway groupings of up-regulated genes in b. pahangi and b. malayi microfilariae revealed some noteworthy differences. for instance in b. malayi microfilariae, transcripts coding for proteins containing a zinc finger domain accounted for  <dig> of the  <dig>  transcripts that code for proteins involved in the processing of genetic information compared to only  <dig> out of  <dig>  in b. pahangi microfilariae. the zinc finger domain-containing proteins are thought to be mainly involved with the regulation of transcription  <cit> . the reason for the bias in b. malayi towards having higher numbers of up-regulated transcripts of zinc finger domain-containing proteins is at present not clear.

melanotic encapsulation is a major antimicrobial innate immune defense mechanism in insects that involves the rapid deposition of melanin around invading microbes  <cit> . molecules on the surface of invading pathogens are thought to be one of the triggers of melanin synthesis in insects. the proteins and molecules on the surfaces of b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae have been shown to be similar with only slight differences in the molecular weights of some proteins  <cit> . microfilarial proteins likely to modulate the vertebrate and mosquito immune response are those that are likely to be secreted by or on the surface of the microfilariae. our microarray data showed that both species had, between them, a total of sixty-six preferentially expressed transcripts, twenty seven in b. pahangi and thirty nine in b. malayi, that coded for proteins likely to be secreted by or on the surface of the microfilariae. as microfilariae are exposed to both vertebrate and mosquito immune responses in quick succession, it is possible that some of these proteins may have a dual function in helping to promote microfilaria survival in midst of a human or mosquito immune response. among transcripts preferentially transcribed in b. pahangi microfilariae and identifiable as coding for known immunomodulatory proteins were a putative homolog of the transforming growth factor-beta   <cit> , three putative serpins  <cit>  and two fkbp-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase proteins  <cit> .

human tgf-beta is a ubiquitous protein that plays a role in most biological processes. with regard to immunity, tgf-beta acts as an inhibitory cytokine that has an important role, together with interleukin- <dig>  in down regulating immunity and hence maintain self-tolerance and immune homeostasis  <cit> . the b. malayi ortholog of tgf-beta, designated as bm-tgh- <dig>  is expressed mainly in mature adult parasites and the microfilariae; two of the nematode's life stages that are constantly exposed to the human immune response factors  <cit> . it is, therefore, plausible that the bm-tgh- <dig> gene in b. pahangi may mimic the functions of human tgf-beta by modulating the vertebrate immune response, thereby promoting parasite survival within the vertebrate host  <cit> .

in melanoma cells, tgf-beta has been shown to significantly inhibit melanin synthesis by increasing the rate of degradation of tyrosinase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the melanogenesis pathway  <cit> . in the brugia microfilariae-ar. subalbatus interaction, most b. pahangi microfilariae are not melanized whereas the b. malayi microfilariae are melanized and destroyed in the mosquito hemocoel  <cit> , suggesting that the b. pahangi microfilariae actively subvert or are deficient of the elements that trigger the synthesis of melanin in ar. subalbatus. in light of our microarray data showing that b. pahangi microfilariae had significantly higher transcript levels of the tgf-beta homolog than b. malayi microfilariae, it is possible that b. pahangi-derived tgf-beta may negatively modulate the synthesis of melanin, essential in the melanization immune response in ar. subalbatus, by a similar mechanism as that shown to occur in melanoma cells.

serpins are proteins that inhibit the serine proteases that control proteolytic cascades in various cellular processes. in vertebrates, serpins function to mitigate the damage caused by proteases involved in the body's immune response to injury such as inflammation and coagulation  <cit> . in the case of insects, serpins have been shown to negatively regulate the proteolytic cascade of serine proteases that activate phenoloxidase, a key enzyme in the biochemical synthesis of melanin  <cit> . the effect, if any, that microfilaria-derived serpins have on the vertebrate immune system remains unclear  <cit> . in the case of mosquito-parasite interactions, rnai studies have shown that mosquito-derived serpins influence the outcome of malaria parasite infections in a parasite species-specific manner whereby the knockdown of anopheles gambiae serpin  <dig>  leads to markedly reduced numbers of p. berghei oocysts in the a. gambiae midgut  <cit>  but has no effect on the development of p. falciparum oocysts  <cit> . to date, there have been no reported functional studies on the effect of brugia microfilaria serpins on the mosquito melanotic immune response. according to the recently published draft of the b. malayi genome  <cit> , there are thirteen serpin locus tags implying that there may be up to thirteen possible serpin genes in b. malayi, however only  <dig> were represented on the bmv <dig> array. the microarray results in this study showed that b. pahangi microfilariae had two to five times higher transcript levels of three putative serpins than did b. malayi microfilariae. it may be that these b. pahangi-derived serpins modulate the melanization immune response in ar. subalbatus.

CONCLUSIONS
in nature, the microfilariae of both species encounter the vertebrate and insect immune responses in fairly quick succession following their ingestion in a blood meal by a mosquito. in order for the microfilariae to survive in both the vertebrate and mosquito hosts, it is conceivable that the microfilariae possess a mechanism that functions to modulate both the vertebrate and mosquito immune systems. in the current study, we identified transcripts that are preferentially expressed in b. pahangi and b. malayi microfilariae. these comparative transcriptome data will be of interest to researchers keen on understanding the intrinsic difference, at the molecular level, between b. malayi and b. pahangi microfilariae especially because these microfilariae elicit such different immune response outcomes in the mosquito, ar. subalbatus. in addition, we further identified transcripts that encode for proteins that are predicted to be secreted or located on the surface of microfilariae and which could have a significant and dual role in the successive interaction of the microfilaria with the vertebrate and mosquito hosts. consequently, some of these proteins may serve as ideal targets for intervention strategies against the transmission of brugian lymphatic filariasis.
