BACKGROUND
the gilthead sea bream  is widely farmed around the mediterranean with main centres of production in greece, turkey, spain and italy. this species which is primarily marketed as fresh fish or fillets is also cultivated in the red sea, the persian gulf, and the arabian sea with global production reaching circa  <dig>  metric tonnes in  <dig>  <cit> . gilthead sea bream is a protandrous hermaphrodite that can reach about 70 cm in length and 5 kg body mass. males become sexually mature after  <dig>  kg and by the second year most individuals have become female . the axial musculature or fillet is made up of serially arranged myotomes comprising ~65% of body mass containing slow, intermediate and fast muscle fibre types  <cit> . fast muscle fibres comprise the bulk of the myotome. the main expansion of fast muscle fibre with growth occurs by a process called mosaic hyperplasia in which myogenic progenitor cells  fuse to form new myotubes on the surface of existing muscle fibres giving rise to a mosaic of fibre diameters as the fish matures  <cit> . mpcs also contribute additional nuclei to the muscle fibre as it expands in length and diameter  <cit> . in all life history stages, myogenesis involves steps of myoblast proliferation, migration, fusion, terminal differentiation and sarcomere assembly and many of the transcription factors and signaling molecules required for the regulation of these processes have been characterised  <cit> . in the majority of teleost, mosaic hyperplasia in fast muscle continues until the fish reaches around 40% of its maximum body length  <cit> . myogenesis is a highly plastic process in which internal and external signals arising from changing environmental conditions; swimming activity and nutritional inputs are integrated to modify growth patterns  <cit> . embryonic temperature regime results in persistent changes in growth patterns in later life affecting the final number and size distribution of muscle fibres in adult fish  <cit>  with potential impacts on flesh quality parameters such as texture  <cit> .

the application of genomic technologies promises to revolutionise our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of muscle growth and plasticity in farmed fish species; thereby increasing the efficiency and sustainability of aquaculture production. for example, the discovery of genetic polymorphisms associated with commercially important production traits such as growth rate and flesh quality would form the foundation for marker-assisted selection to produce superior strains for farming. genomic studies could also enable bioactive nutritional components to be identified in commercial feeds and be used to accelerate the development of more sustainable diets with lower environmental impact. the genome of atlantic cod  has recently been described  <cit>  and several other farmed fish are in the process of being sequenced to draft level including rainbow trout   <cit> , atlantic salmon   <cit>  and tilapia   <cit> . there are also significant genetic resources available for the european sea bass  another important species in mediterranean aquaculture. for example, kuhl et al  <cit>  developed a complete bac-end library from the sea bass and gilthead sea bream genomes using the three-spined stickleback  genome as a reference for description and annotation. in contrast, there are only  <dig> genbank sequences and  <dig> ests for the gilthead sea bream . these sequencing efforts have allowed the development of microarray platforms for gene expression studies  <cit>  and sets of microsatellites for selection programs  <cit> . however, the comparative lack of genetic information is a significant handicap for the development of a serious program for genetic improvement of stocks by marker assistance-selection and for a better understanding of the molecular basis of nutrition, growth, flesh quality, reproduction and disease resistance.

next generation sequencing  technologies have the potential to rapidly and cost effectively expand sequence databases for non-model organisms  <cit> . in the present study we have used roche  <dig> gs flx titanium sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptome of fast skeletal muscle using rna extracted from adult and juvenile gilthead sea bream subject to different nutritional states and temperatures. the resulting transcriptome with 40-times average coverage was annotated and screened for gene paralogues, alternatively spliced transcripts and microsatellite repeat sequences.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly
four separate cdna libraries were created from rna extracted from the fast skeletal muscle of  <dig> pooled fish per treatment: juveniles  which had been either fed to satiation, fasted for 3– <dig> d  or acutely transferred to  <dig> or 33°c over 48 h and maintained for 3-5d with continued feeding. a cdna library was also created from rna extracted from the fast skeletal muscle of one adult  fish fed ~3% body mass d- <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig>  reads were generated per library giving a total of ~ <dig>  million sequence reads . reads were deposited in the sequence read archive  database with the accession number erp <dig>  <cit> . sequence reads were assembled using newbler v <dig>  assembler . newbler v <dig>  used 42% of the reads to construct  <dig>  isotigs over 100 bp . the total number of isotigs annotated by blast2go was  <dig>  . details of blast hit and go distributions for isotigs are provided in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  analysis of annotated isotigs revealed the presence of  <dig> unique genes transcripts, indicating 46–50% redundancy.

n50: the value was computed by sorting all contigs from largest to smallest and by determining the minimum set of contigs whose sizes total 50% of the entire transcriptome.

assembly validation
 <dig> full-length cdnas  from gilthead sea bream were retrieved from genbank and blasted against the assembled transcriptome resulting in  <dig> positive hits suitable for analysis . pairwise alignment in clustalw showed 25% of sequences were identical and 24% differed by only one nucleotide. the proportion of isotigs with more than one nucleotide difference is shown in figure  <dig>  85% of differences were mismatches,  <dig> % insertions and  <dig> % deletions . the coverage of the transcriptome was calculated from a random selection of  <dig> annotated isotigs and visualized using tablet software  <cit> . coverage for annotated isotigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  times with an average coverage of  <dig> times.

assembly annotation
annotated isotigs were attributed to  <dig> different kegg pathway maps . in addition, the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway and sarcomeric proteins maps were manually constructed to determine the actual representation of components in the transcriptome . in the case of sarcomeric proteins, all major components were shown to be present and isoforms of myosin heavy chain , actinin , tropomyosin , actin capping protein , myomesin , filamin , myomezin , myosin light chain , nebulin , myosin binding protein , actin , titin , tropomodulin  and troponin c  were identified together with potential splice variants of calpain- <dig> and myopalladin-like . components of the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway also occurred as multiple isoforms including akt , pi3k , flotillin , integrin β-chain  and insulin receptor substrate  . the only pi3k/akt/mtor pathway component that was not represented in the transcriptome was the companion of mtor raptor .

identification of full-length coding sequences  and splice variants
 <dig>  translated isotigs were manually blasted against the ncbi non-redundant protein  database using blastp. a total of  <dig> full-length coding sequences were identified. proteins ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . the  <dig> genes with splice variants identified among the cds are summarized in additional file  <dig>  in all cases one or more exons were predicted to be lost after splicing. functional domains were identified using interproscan and  <dig> splicing events were identified that resulted in some change in domain composition or structure which was predicted to potentially affect their biological function. because of their biological importance, all  <dig> genes with a loss of functional domain were verified by pcr, resulting in the experimental confirmation of  <dig> genes .

identification of microsatellite sequences
the transcriptome was screened for potential microsatellite repeats excluding adenine repetitions, which most likely correspond to polya tails. around  <dig> potential microsatellites were detected in the total isotigs . to provide information linked to known sequences, only microsatellites localized in annotated isotigs were further studied. a total of  <dig> non-redundant microsatellites were identified in annotated isotigs. dinucleotide repeated motifs were the most abundant, representing 75% of the total, followed by mononucleotide , trinucleotide , tetranucleotide  and pentanucleotide  repeats . all  <dig> microsatellite reported in this study were found in predicted utr regions with 40% of them linked to full-coding sequence genes.

identification of gene paralogues
translated isotigs from the transcriptome were compared with mouse and teleost proteomes using inparanoid software producing  <dig> positive matches. after removal of false positives and redundant sequences  <dig> potential paralogues were identified. phylogenetic analysis confirmed that  <dig> of these genes were paralogues. 74% of these paralogues  were teleost-specific, likely originating from the whole genome duplication event at the base of the teleost radiation . eight ensembl genes used for the phylogenetical analysis  were well annotated and identified as paralogues, but no specific nomenclature was assigned in the database. for two gilthead sea bream paralogues  genes from ensembl were identified as paralogues but not functionally annotated and blastx against the ncbi non-redundant protein database was used to confirm their identity.

partial assemblies and expression analysis
since only one adult individual was sequenced expression analysis was restricted to juveniles . the individual assemblies for each group are summarized in table  <dig>  all partial transcriptomes were individually investigated to identify the  <dig> most expressed genes. five genes were among the top  <dig> most abundant transcripts in all groups: phosphoglucose isomerase- <dig>  calsequestrin- <dig>  elongation factor 1-alpha, cyclin g <dig>  parvalbumin and adenosine monophosphate deaminase- <dig> . pairwise comparisons of the number of reads that contributed to each isotig were made to provide information on differential gene expression between treatments . the top  <dig> genes appearing in the ranked list of significant differences between treatments are shown in table  <dig> and three examples of the differences in reads mapped for each experimental group are shown in figure  <dig> 

gene description, orthologue accession number and e-values were obtained by blastx against the ncbi nr database. both p-values and fdr p-value were calculated by chi-square and fdr statistic using r statistical package  <cit> .

discussion
the number of genes that can be obtained from next generation sequencing is higher for normalised than non-normalised libraries of the kind used in the present study; however, unbiased libraries have the advantage of yielding a higher number of full-length cdna sequences  <cit> . the number of annotated isotigs in the present study was  <dig>   corresponding to  <dig>  unique genes. the total number of annotated sequences was less than reported in the coral  transcriptome   <cit> , rainbow trout    <cit> , but similar to that obtained for eel    <cit> . however, since our transcriptome was for a single tissue type  a lower number of unique genes would be expected than for transcriptomes based on sequencing dsdna libraries from multiple tissues. in addition, previous studies  <cit>  have considered singletons to be a valid source for gene discovery whereas the  <dig>  singletons  obtained in the present study were not included in further analysis.

our study is the first report of a skeletal muscle transcriptome in teleost fish and it contained  <dig> unique transcripts including over  <dig> annotated transcripts related to transcription control,  <dig> microsatellite markers  and  <dig> full-length cdnas. the total number of microsatellites obtained was similar than in previous studies  <cit> . the transcriptome contained all known components of the sarcomere and the majority of proteins were represented by multiple isoforms even though the starting tissue for library construction comprised a pure population of fast twitch muscle fibres . multiple isoforms of troponins and myosin light chains have previously been reported in single fish muscle fibres  <cit> . it is likely that isoforms that are expressed at specific developmental stages  <cit>  or temperatures  <cit>  contribute to the overall diversity of sarcomeric proteins . previously, only  <dig> genes with splice variants have been reported in gilthead sea bream based on sanger sequencing  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> genes with potential splice variants were described, including  <dig> that affected known functional domains. this is a relatively low discovery rate given that 30% of genes in the three-spine stickleback genome were predicted to occur as multiple transcripts  <cit> . the reads containing the splice variant regions were analysed . in the majority of cases, the number of reads containing the deletion was lower than for the unspliced sequences, indicating lower levels of expression. in contrast, for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4b and c4b binding protein the reads containing the deletion were more abundant and for a few genes, including bridging integrator  <dig> and cathepsin h, the proportion of splice variants was similar. the physiological effect of the splice variants with altered functional domains was not analysed in the present work and further studies are necessary to evaluate their impact on cell physiology.

a whole genome duplication occurred in basal teleosts around 300– <dig> million years ago resulting in duplicate copies of many genes relative to the common ancestor with tetrapods  <cit> . it was estimated that in the green spotted puffer fish tetraodon nigriviridis around 15% of the duplicate genes have been retained  <cit> . previous transcriptomic studies in atlantic cod   <cit> , whitefish   <cit>  and eel   <cit>  have not attempted to identify paralogues. in the present study with over  <dig>  transcripts annotated we expected over  <dig> paralogues, but only  <dig> could be identified. differences between expected and the actual number of paralogues found can be explained by three main factors. the first factor is linked to sequence errors in the transcriptome. we found an error rate of 1:200 bp  similar to previous studies  <cit>  with  <dig> % of the transcripts having insertions or deletions in their sequence. in our study, paralogue screening was based on translated isotigs, which are dramatically affected by insertions and deletions. this is because any insertion/deletions that are not multiples of three will change the open reading frame of the isotigs or introduce an in-frame stop codon. the second factor resulting in a low rate of paralogue discovery is the short length of some of the translated peptides. the majority of automatically translated isotigs represented less than 50% of the predicted sequence length . thus potential paralogues with short translated isotigs failed to pass the quality filters and were not considered further. finally a very small effect will come from the assembly. many assemblers are designed to tolerate imperfect sequence alignment to avoid missing true joins. this tolerance for error could result in false positive joins that mask polymorphisms, including paralogues  <cit> . this effect will be small due the divergence of the paralogues retained after the whole genome duplication, but cannot be completely discarded as a possibility.

another advantage of using unbiased libraries is that it potentially allows information on gene expression levels to be obtained. the approach used here was to carry out pairwise comparisons between treatments counting the numbers of reads that contributed to isotigs in an assembly derived from the combined treatments . the results indicate marked plasticity in gene expression with respect to nutritional status and temperature. in many cases, genes highly ranked for differential abundance between treatments corresponded to the activation of particular pathways. for example, in fed fish, stress chaperones including hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> and proteins associated with prevention of unfolded protein aggregation, and cytoskeleton structure maintenance was significantly elevated in 33°c compared to 21°c treatments . heat shock proteins function to increase thermal tolerance following acute exposure to high temperature stress  <cit> . in contrast, there was no clear pattern of gene expression in the low temperature group that can be specifically associated with treatment. this may result from low temperature inhibiting feeding and inducing a similar depression of protein synthesis and metabolism as observed for fasted fish at higher temperature, thereby masking the specific effects of acute cold stress.

food deprivation reduces gene expression of enzymes related with glycolysis in fish liver  <cit>  and muscle  <cit> . we found a decreased contribution of sequences to isotigs for genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism in fasted relative to fed treatments . the fed library was also enriched for notch- <dig> which is thought to control myoblast activity and be related to the asymmetric self-renewal of the muscle satellite cells through its inhibitor numb  <cit> . it has been suggested that increased notch expression inhibits differentiation  <cit>  and stimulates myoblast proliferation  <cit> . the significant increase of notch- <dig> expression and other genes related with metabolism  could be an indication of higher metabolic rates and myoblast activity in this group compared to treatments exposed to stressful conditions. there was evidence for the upregulation of adenylate kinase- <dig>  in fasted compared to fed libraries. ak acts as a sensor of the energy status of tissues  <cit> . an increase of some of the adenylate kinase isoforms was also reported in response to the energy imbalance during fasting in rat tissues  <cit> . we also found up-regulation of three sarcomeric genes  consistent with shifts in myofibrillar protein isoform composition towards a slow muscle phenotype in fasted fish. studies in atlantic salmon also reported an increase in myosin heavy chain and the myosin light chain  <dig> transcripts with fasting  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have produced a detailed fast skeletal muscle transcriptome for the gilthead sea bream, a commercially important aquaculture species in the mediterranean. the transcriptome contained  <dig> unique annotated genes and  <dig> full-length coding sequences including key transcription factors, signaling molecules and structural proteins involved in myogenesis and growth. some limitations in the identification of gene paralogues with  <dig> sequencing were found. in order to facilitate future genomic studies in this species a blast server has been made available which contains  <dig>   <dig> annotated and  <dig>  un-annotated isotigs together with ~  <dig> , <dig> ests  <cit> .
