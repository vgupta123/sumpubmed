BACKGROUND
water is considered to be the most limiting environmental factor with regard to plant growth and maintenance. furthermore, dehydration is a common component of other abiotic stresses, such as freezing, high temperatures, and salt stress. loss of water not only affects plants in the short term, but can also weaken them, making them more susceptible to biotic and other abiotic stresses in the long term  <cit> . plants have developed a variety of adaptations for ameliorating dehydrative stress. in one strategy, known as drought escape, the plant completes its lifecycle before arrival of the drier summer months. another strategy, drought tolerance, results in the production of osmoprotectants, i.e. compounds that aid in preventing water loss from the cells or act to relieve the negative impact of the dehydrative stress on cellular components. a third mechanism, drought avoidance, allows plants to circumvent drought periods by morphological changes that allow plants to maintain high water status, for example, by encouraging deeper root penetration in the soil.

another parameter related to plant water status is wue which is a function of carbon utilization through photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration. in herbaceous plants there is often a tradeoff between suppression of photosynthesis and prevention of water loss, since wue is closely tied to stomata function. for some annuals and perennials, increased wue results in a measure of drought tolerance at the expense of growth and development  <cit> . on the other hand, some annuals maximize photosynthesis through increased stomatal conductance , thus lowering wue. although on the surface this seems counterintuitive, this strategy works because the plants ‘outgrow’  before the onset of seasonal droughts  <cit> .

regardless of which strategy a plant uses to survive, adaptation to drought requires complex interactions between anatomy, physiology and biochemistry, all of which are directly or indirectly under genetic control  <cit> . studies examining genes in herbaceous plants that respond to dehydration have identified a number of common genes potentially related to drought resistance [reviewed in  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis several lea genes , metallothionein genes and a ripening-related protein gene have all been shown to respond to drought, as well as to other abiotic stresses  <cit> . these same genes in other plants  also show a strong response in transcript level when exposed to drought  <cit> .

in woody plants similar studies have identified genes that appear to be significant for drought tolerance  <cit> . transcriptional profiling was used to assess gene expression in poplar  subjected to a gradual drought treatment  <cit> . since these studies were long term in contrast to studies with herbaceous plants, the percentage of genes expressed in response to drought was substantially lower. the expression of these genes may represent gradual adaptation, leading to acclimation to long term, moderate water deficit. in maritime pine , dubos and plomion  <cit>  identified  <dig> cdna-aflp fragments responding to polyethylene drought simulation, most of which were genes of unknown function. genes which were down-regulated in roots included histone h2b, caffeic acid ortho-methyltransferase and a lea protein, all of which have been shown to be up-regulated in other systems  <cit> .

suppression subtractive hybridization  has been used successfully to identify differentially regulated genes in a number of plant and animal systems  <cit> . although different methodologies for assessing global gene expression have various strengths and weaknesses, ssh is known for its ability to identify low-abundance transcripts. in the current study we applied this method to identify genes up- and down-regulated in response to a simulated drought and at the end of a one week recovery period. some of the genes have been previously described in other plants, but several genes crucial to metabolism or defense were unique to this study.

RESULTS
genes responding to simulated drought
genes whose mrnas respond to drought have been identified and verified in a number of plant systems. we used ssh to identify genes in apple roots that were either up- or down-regulated by a simulated severe drought lasting two weeks . in addition, we identified genes whose expression changed after a week of water deficit recovery. using bioinformatic tools we were able to design gene-specific primers for select genes from each treatment library to determine whether members of multigene families were identical or different in treatments where they appeared in more than one library . in this paper we focus on the results of our analysis of roots during water deficit and recovery .

tables  <dig> and  <dig> contain a list of genes that were up-  or down-regulated  in response to water deficit treatment compared to well-watered controls run in parallel. twice as many genes were identified in the library representing genes whose expression was elevated in response to drought compared to those that were down-regulated. tables  <dig> and  <dig> list genes up-regulated after recovery from the drought treatment  or elevated during drought treatment  relative to recovery. nearly three times as many genes were identified in the bbf library as in the bbr library. because samples were taken after two weeks of drought, very early drought-responsive genes, including many transcription factors and signaling components, would not be expected to be identified in our libraries. one exception is the drought-responsive leucine zipper homeobox gene whose transcripts increased in drought-treated roots . since this gene is a close relative of the arabiodpsis athb <dig> and athb <dig> genes which are also drought-induced  <cit> , its elevated presence two weeks after the beginning of the drought period may be indicative of a role in maintenance of the drought response.

in three of the ssh libraries copper-binding proteins were identified. the h01bbf sequence  matched  a copper chaperone from fragaria vesca . three putative copper binding proteins were also identified in the bbr  subtraction: h11bbr and contig2bbr aligned with an early nodulin <dig> precursor  from ricinus communis , and h04bbr aligned with a predicted copper binding protein from prunus persica . in addition, clone d07aar  aligned with another copper binding protein, mavicyanin, from ricinus communis . with the exception of h01bbf, all of these genes appear to be down-regulated in apple roots in response to drought. when cellular copper is limiting, copper chaperones are generally required  <cit> . if cu+ <dig> uptake is reduced by drought treatment, the up-regulation of h01bbf in apple roots would be consistent with previous studies and may reflect its function as a member of the atox copper chaperone family, namely the intracellular delivery of copper to the secretory pathway  <cit> .

three plasma membrane-intrinsic protein  ests were found in roots . when the derived amino acids were analyzed with blastp against the arabidopsis genome, the two ests from drought up-regulated libraries  were found to be most closely matched with arabidopsis pip2- <dig> and pip2- <dig>  respectively . the aar library est  was more closely related to arabidopsis pip2- <dig> . comparison of the ests with each other indicated that the aar and aaf sequences both aligned with the bbf sequence, but with no overlap between them. in addition, most of the amino acid differences between aar and bbf were non-conserved substitutions, as opposed to the conserved differences seen between the aaf and bbf sequences. taken together the results suggest that these genes in fact represent different family members.

since abiotic stress affects a number of critical plant processes, the identification of genes representing a variety of cellular functions in response to drought is to be expected. in combining sequences up-regulated in drought, we included genes from both the aaf and bbf libraries. in both cases the total number of up-regulated genes in response to drought exceeded the number of down-regulated genes by nearly two-fold. many of the identified genes have been previously reported in other plant systems subjected to various types of drought stress  <cit> . for example, metallothionein and related genes are elevated under water deficit conditions in rice, chick pea, and arabidopsis <cit> ; likewise, pips and mal d <dig> have also been commonly associated with dehydration responses.

analysis of specific genes
in order to confirm treatment differences correlated with ssh and affirm the integration of genes responding to water deficit, we conducted an in-depth analysis of three genes whose role under drought conditions has not been well characterized at the molecular level. these genes included ests encoding a high affinity nitrogen transporter , an outermembrane mitochondrial import receptor subunit  and a gene  associated with regulons involved in both systemic acquired and basal resistance to biotic stress.

high affinity nitrate transporters
e05bbf is an est isolated from the root bbf library  and was identified as a high affinity nitrate transporter. in arabidopsis the high affinity nitrate transporters are represented by seven genes: nrt <dig> - <dig> . atnrt <dig>  and atnrt <dig>  are the primary genes responsible for transport of nitrate under low nitrogen availability and appear to be inducible, since a mutant lacking both genes fails to achieve nitrate transport levels similar to the wild-type  <cit> . however, a very high-affinity component is still active in this mutant, and it is thought that this activity corresponds to atnrt <dig> , the most inducible gene under limiting nitrate conditions.

the full length apple gene  represented by the e05bbf est is on chromosome  <dig>  there are three other full length apple genes closely related to e05bbf . of these, mdp <dig> is most like e05bbf and appears to be related to atnrt <dig>  . the remaining two genes are most closely related to atnrt <dig> . mdp <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  whereas mdp <dig> and mdp <dig> are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. all of these predicted proteins are members of the major facilitator superfamily  and possess a nitrogen transporter domain as well  <cit> .

mdp <dig>  has significant homology to both atnrt <dig>  and atnrt <dig>  . in a recent study of malus hupenensis  rehder  <cit> , a full length nitrate transporter gene  was found to share  <dig> % homology with mdp <dig>  whereas a second gene  shared  <dig> % amino acid identity with mdp <dig>

to obtain accurate estimates of the differences in abundance between the drought treatment and recovery, rt-qpcr was performed on all the treatments from roots, as well as samples taken from leaves, bark and xylem subjected to the same conditions . expression of mdnrt <dig>  in leaves was not significantly different in drought-treatment vs. controls , although the additional week of recovery resulted in an overall decline of transcript abundance for reasons not completely clear. orsel et al.  <cit>  reported that atnrt <dig>  was substantially inducible in low concentrations of kno <dig>  whereas okamoto et al.  <cit>  observed repression of atnrt <dig>  levels in both roots and shoots exposed to  <dig>  mm ca <dig> after nitrogen deprivation. in our study the levels of the mdnrt <dig>  transcript from plants under water deficit were 212% of the control in roots and 167% of control in bark; in both organs, recovery resulted in a return to control levels . since nitrogen uptake is by mass flow of water from the soil to the root  <cit> , lower nitrogen levels would be expected in roots of plants under water deficit. in wheat nitrogen-use efficiency was increased by water deficit and diminished in response to increasing concentrations of applied nitrogen  <cit> . our observations regarding mdnrt <dig>  expression are consistent with these reports and may provide a novel avenue for exploring drought resistance, since links between nitrogen deficiency, water deficit response and aba/stomatal function have been previously established  <cit> .

analysis of approximately  <dig> bases upstream of the translation start codon of mdnrt <dig>  identified several cis-elements related to stress or hormone response . two tata boxes representing rna polii binding sites were found, one approximately  <dig> bases from the translation start site. there were no consensus g-box elements in either promoter  <cit> . elements similar to g-box abscisic acid response elements   <cit>  were present in both the arabidopsis and apple nrt <dig>  promoters. however, nrt <dig>  is not likely to respond to drought via aba induction because the core sequence in both g-box elements does not end in cytosine  which is essential for aba induction  <cit> . on the other hand, a consensus c-repeat binding element linked to both cold and drought response was within a functional distance of the first tata box in the apple nrt <dig>  promoter. the second tata box is further upstream and is linked to several myc binding sites, as well as a wound-inducible element  <cit>  and an element associated with hypoosmolarity responsiveness  <cit> . both tata elements could be functional under different regulatory regimes. mapping transcripts originating from this promoter would determine whether or not both tata elements are functional. many of the elements identified in the mdnrt <dig>  promoter were absent in the arabidopsis promoter, and there were considerably fewer myb binding sites  in the atnrt <dig>  promoter .

mitochondrial import translocase subunit 
the mitochondrial import complex  is extensively conserved in eukaryotes and typically contains  <dig> tim and seven tom subunits  <cit> . the tom subunits consist of two receptors  that interact with the pre-protein and five subunits that compose the translocation channel . only three outer membrane proteins are ubiquitous among eukaryotes: tom <dig>  tom <dig> and tom <dig>  <cit> .

an est  was identified in the drought-treated root subtraction encoding a homolog to the tom <dig> subunit. rt-pcr results indicated that c09aaf levels were lower in the drought-treated plants than in the controls. this is not consistent with this sequence having been obtained from the aaf subtraction representing up-regulated sequences. close inspection of the pcr reaction products indicated marked similarity in band intensity between the treatments and also revealed an unpredicted, higher molecular weight band that was amplified, suggesting that a close relative might be interfering with primer hybridization .

blastn alignment of c09aaf against the apple genome found three closely related genes on different chromosomes, one of which  corresponded perfectly with the coding sequence of c09aaf. the three apple tom <dig> genes are found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  mdp <dig>  is located on chromosome  <dig>  several other significant blastn hits were also noted, but these sequences maybe pseudo-genes, as the atg codons are altered. conservation between the apple derived protein sequences and two arabidopsis tom polypeptides is confined mainly to the tom <dig> domain characteristic of the superfamily .

rt-qpcr primers were designed to eliminate any possible contribution from the other two related genes in the rna populations. testing of this primer set indicated that only one product was obtained . this primer set was then used for rt-qpcr analysis and the results are shown in figure  <dig>  in bark, mdtom <dig>  was moderately elevated under drought conditions compared to its control. on the other hand, mdtom <dig>  in roots and leaves was not appreciably different from the well watered controls and did not decline to control levels during the recovery phase as observed in bark. this is supported by analysis of the mdtom <dig> promoters where no abre or dre sequences were found in the first  <dig> bases upstream of the atg codon . in contrast both elements were present just upstream of the tata box in mdtom <dig>  . in apple leaves expression of mdtom <dig>  was similar to the expression of at5g <dig>  and at1g <dig>   in arabidopsis whole plants treated with salt or exposed to  <dig> °c, showing little or no change compared to controls. however, both arabidopsis genes show greater accumulation in the polysomal fraction of plants exposed to dehydration treatment, relative to control polysomes or the non-polysomal fraction of controls and treated plants  <cit> , indicating that regulation of tom <dig> may not be solely transcriptional. based on these observations and the presence of stress-responsive elements in the promoter of mdtom <dig> , it would be of interest to examine expression of this gene in the same rna populations from the organs of drought-treated apple to determine if it indeed responds to water deficit treatment.

tom <dig> binds to tom <dig> in the outer mitochondrial membrane where it is thought to modulate pore formation and might be expected to play a role during drought stress. the fact that drought did not appear to alter mdtom <dig>  transcript levels in apple or arabidopsis suggests that regulation at another level may be more important to plant tom <dig>  or that drought treatment alters another component of the mitochondrial import complex  to allow continual mitochondrial functioning in plants under stress.

nonexpressor of pathogenesis related genes 
an est  encoding mpnpr1- <dig> <cit>  was isolated from the library containing genes up-regulated in response to drought . quantitative assessment of mpnpr1- <dig> expression in roots, bark and leaves of drought-treated apples indicated that its mrna was elevated nearly four times in drought-treated roots over control roots in the  <dig> experiment, although in an earlier experiment there was essentially no difference . a smaller increase was noted in drought treated bark and xylem , but surprisingly drought treatment lowered its expression in leaves from both experiments .

a previous study of npr expression in apple identified three npr <dig> genes  <cit> . but only mpnpr1- <dig> was induced with bth thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid) treatment to induce systemic acquired resistance , suggesting that this may be the ortholog to the arabidopsis gene, atnpr <dig>  atnpr <dig> encodes a protein with ankyrin repeats that binds to transcription factors of the tga subfamily of basic leucine zipper proteins  <cit> . traditionally, npr <dig> has been associated with salicylic acid -linked systemic acquired resistance affecting a broad spectrum of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria and viruses. a recently described role for cytoplasmic npr <dig> in jasmonic acid  suppression has been reported  <cit> , as well as an association with basal defense response  <cit> . expression of atnpr <dig> is generally constitutive showing only a modest  induction by sa  <cit> .

cross-talk between signaling pathways has been known for some time. for example, drought-stressed plants are generally more susceptible to pathogen attack than unstressed plants  <cit> . a study in rice revealed a connection that may be related to the ja suppression role of npr <dig>  <cit> . in this study, constitutive expression of the arabidopsis atnpr <dig> gene in rice leaves conferred resistance to several fungal pathogens and one bacterial pathogen by ‘priming’ the sar pathway. interestingly, the same transgenic lines resistant to the pathogens were more sensitive to drought and salt treatments. these results correlated with reduced expression  of some key genes associated with abiotic stress, e.g. rab <dig>  our results appear to corroborate suppression of npr1- <dig> in leaves under drought stress with studies indicating increased susceptibility of stressed plants to different pathogens. most interesting is the observation that mpnpr1- <dig> is significantly elevated in roots at the end of a two-week, continuous water deficit treatment. these results suggest a role for mpnpr1- <dig> in root-specific protection against soil-borne pathogens during drought stress.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified apple root genes that respond to a two week, moderately severe simulated drought and to a one week period of recovery. most of the genes identified have been previously reported to be drought- or stress-responsive in other plants. three genes not previously associated with root response to drought were further characterized. two genes, mdnrt <dig>  and mpnpr1- <dig> were shown by quantitative rt-pcr analysis to be up-regulated in apple roots subjected to drought. the third gene, mdtom <dig>  was not appreciably expressed in response to drought treatment.

the results from two independent experiments demonstrate that drought treatment increases expression of a high-affinity nitrate transporter  which is consistent with previous research associating drought with nitrogen deficiency. our results from the  <dig> experiment also suggest that mpnpr1- <dig> may have a defense role in roots, since its up-regulation in this organ in response to abiotic stress has not been previously reported. finally, a reproducible decrease in mpnpr <dig> in leaves in association with drought treatment may explain why many plants under abiotic stress are reported to be more susceptible to pathogen attack. further analysis of these gene families may identify altered functions or expression for individual family members arising as a requirement for adaptation to the varying environmental conditions that most perennial plants face.
