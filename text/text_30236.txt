BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous organism that is occasionally present in the intestinal tract of various animal species and can cause severe illness in humans after the ingestion of contaminated food products. although the annual incidence of human listeriosis is quite low in the basque country  compared to salmonellosis  or campylobacteriosis   <cit> , l. monocytogenes is among the most important foodborne bacterial pathogens due to the high mortality rate  and severity of the disease particularly among pregnant women, neonates and immunosuppressed adults. in addition, l. monocytogenes febrile gastroenteritis can also affect healthy people, though many of these cases most probably go unreported.

adult swine can be infected by l. monocytogenes but rarely develop disease  <cit>  and the bacterium is not commonly isolated from swine faeces  <cit> . however, pork meat products have been linked to human infection  <cit>  and contamination of the slaughter and processing environment has been traced back to healthy carrier pigs  <cit> . in ruminants, l. monocytogenes can cause neurological disease and abortion, but in general, animals infected are asymptomatic carriers that shed the bacterium in their faeces  <cit> . faecal contamination of the farm environment favours animal re-infection and persistence of the pathogen in the production units  <cit> . in addition, the widespread distribution of l. monocytogenes in nature and soil environments is favoured by its ability to grow in a wide range of temperature and ph  <cit> . this is particularly important in silage production since in many cases the ph reached in the fermentation process is not low enough to prevent growth of l. monocytogenes  <cit> . therefore, ruminants fed on silage are at higher risk of getting l. monocytogenes infection  <cit> .

hence, animal production units may represent a reservoir for l. monocytogenes and source for human infection via faecal contamination of food products since certain l. monocytogenes types carried by farm animals have been associated with human infections  <cit> . though eradication from the farm is highly unlikely due to the ability of l. monocytogenes to survive and multiply in many habitats and hosts, transmission and contamination load could probably be reduced through the implementation of adequate intervention strategies. in this context, this study was aimed at determining the prevalence and strain diversity of l. monocytogenes in healthy ruminants and swine herds, as a first step before establishing efficient farm-based control measures.

RESULTS
herd and within-herd prevalence
l. monocytogenes was isolated from  <dig> of the  <dig> herds included in the study . l. monocytogenes was absent from all  <dig> porcine herds analysed, but present in cattle  and sheep . l. monocytogenes herd prevalence was significantly  higher in cattle than sheep. among cattle, l. monocytogenes was significantly  more prevalent in dairy than in beef cattle herds . in two of the four farms where both sheep and cattle herds were sampled no infection was detected, in the third one l. monocytogenes was isolated from cattle but not from sheep, and in another both herds were positive and selected for the within-herd prevalence study . positivity was scattered throughout the different regions and no clear geographical pattern was observed. no correlation was found between herd and animal census and l. monocytogenes prevalence by province or county . however, in the county with the largest census prevalence values were always above the mean.

a total of  <dig> animals from  <dig> herds  were individually analysed for l. monocytogenes faecal shedding. within-herd prevalence for l. monocytogenes was higher in dairy cattle  than in beef cattle  or sheep  . this difference was also seen in the farm with infected sheep  and dairy cattle  . however, the proportion of shedders varied considerably among herds, especially among dairy cattle . differences were smaller among ovine herds, but in two of them no positive animals where detected. no significant seasonal variation in herd prevalence was observed .

distribution and characterisation of listeria monocytogenes isolates
a total of  <dig> l. monocytogenes isolates were serotyped , including one isolate from each positive pool  and  <dig> isolates from the within-herd prevalence study . most of the isolates  were identified as serotype 4b complex. the remaining were serotype 1/2a , 1/2b , and 4c . serotypes 4b complex and 1/2a were found in sheep and cattle, whereas serotype 1/2b isolates were found in dairy cattle and the 4c isolate in beef cattle. in  <dig> dairy cattle herds, different serotypes  were identified. no association was found between sampling season and serotype.

a serotype 4b and the closely related, albeit rarely encountered serotype 4d and 4e

apai pfge analysis performed on  <dig> isolates  generated  <dig> patterns;  <dig> of them were unique patterns represented by single isolates only, and the remaining  <dig> included 2â€“ <dig> isolates. six patterns where shared by isolates obtained from sheep and cattle. however, isolates obtained from the sheep and cattle herd sharing the same farm premises  were clearly different according to their pfge types . serotype 1/2a isolates formed a separated cluster from the 4b complex isolates at similarity levels below 40% . diversity was high among 1/2a isolates , whereas for 4b isolates,  <dig> pfge clusters  were observed at the 90% similarity level. two of these clusters were represented by  <dig> and  <dig> isolates each, isolated from both sheep and cattle. the most prevalent pattern  was isolated from a sheep herd,  <dig> beef cattle herds and  <dig> dairy cattle herds. another pattern found in the three production systems was la- <dig> . the analysis of  <dig> ovine isolates from  <dig> herds generated  <dig> patterns, whereas in cattle  <dig> patterns were identified among the  <dig> isolates obtained from  <dig> herds. most of the ruminant isolates analysed by pfge had been isolated from faecal pools from different herds. however, in  <dig> herds several isolates originating from individual faecal samples were analysed and in  <dig> of them nearly all isolates  had different patterns , demonstrating that several strains coexisted in the herds. also interesting was to identify the same pattern in two dairy cattle herds  located  <dig> km apart.

discussion
this is the first study carried out in farms from the basque country to determine the prevalence of l. monocytogenes in healthy animals. comparison of prevalence results among different studies can be influenced by variation in sampling strategies and season, and differences in detection methods used. in addition, most data on l. monocytogenes in ruminants are obtained from cases of clinical listeriosis. although day-to-day variation in l. monocytogenes faecal shedding in dairy cattle has been demonstrated  <cit> , single day sampling can provide an initial snap-shot image of the general situation with regard to the prevalence of l. monocytogenes in healthy herds in a region where no such data are available. in this manner, the proportion of faecal shedders observed in this study was similar to that reported by nightingale et al.  <cit>  among ruminants without clinical symptoms. likewise, prevalence was higher in cattle  than sheep. nightingale et al.  <cit>  showed that contrary to sheep, cattle exposed to l. monocytogenes through contaminated silage amplify the pathogen to high levels subsequently increasing faecal shedding, and thus contributing to the maintenance and dispersal of l. monocytogenes into the farm environment. a pronounced seasonal variation in faecal shedding has been reported in cattle farms with peak prevalences during the colder months associated to increased silage feeding  <cit> . quality of feed provided during the indoor season has also been considered an important risk factor for listeriosis in ruminants  <cit> . samples for the herd prevalence study were collected throughout the year, and no seasonal variation in herd prevalence was observed. however, it is noteworthy that the highest within-herd prevalence of l. monocytogenes shedders corresponded to a dairy cattle herd sampled in winter . nevertheless, in the basque country, sheep and beef cattle spend most of the year pasture-grazing outdoors, whereas dairy cattle are kept indoors throughout the year under a diet based on silage, which has been reported as a risk for l. monocytogenes infection  <cit> . stress associated to lactation in dairy cattle might affect susceptibility to l. monocytogenes infection  <cit>  and contribute to differences in shedding between beef and dairy cattle. daily variability in the number of faecal shedders  <cit>  could explain the wide differences in the within-herd prevalence values observed among the four dairy cattle herds, and the absence of shedders in two ovine herds when sampled individually. the higher prevalence of ruminant herds positive for l. monocytogenes in areas with larger animal census suggests a possible relation between animal density and infection risk, however, more extensive epidemiological data collection  and environmental sampling are needed to confirm this link and identify sources of contamination and infection routes.

swine production in the basque country is not extensive and therefore, the number of swine herds analysed in this study was limited. however, l. monocytogenes was never detected in the pig herds analysed. although l. monocytogenes occurs frequently in pork products, it is rarely isolated from swine faeces  <cit> . higher infection rates are detected in skin swabs  <cit>  or tonsils  <cit> , and the prevalence of l. monocytogenes in swine generally increases from the farm to the manufacturing plants. hence, the main source for contamination with l. monocytogenes appears to be the slaughter and processing environment where l. monocytogenes can survive for long periods  <cit> . listeriosis is frequently traced to ready-to-eat  meat products, regardless of meat animal source, and some delicatessen rte pork products have been involved in listeriosis outbreaks  <cit> . conversely, bovine or ovine meat products are rarely associated to human listeriosis, but ruminant healthy carriers may shed listeria in faeces contaminating pastures or vegetables  <cit> , surface waters  <cit>  and milk  <cit> . in a study carried out in navarra  on food samples from different industries and markets  <cit> , the incidence of l. monocytogenes in raw minced beef and pork meat was  <dig> %,  <dig> % in raw milk samples , and  <dig> % in soft cheese. nevertheless, unpasteurised dairy products represent the major problem regarding human infection.

strain typing can help to identify sources of infection and routes of transmission and in this sense, is commonly used for disease tracking in human infections. l. monocytogenes comprises a diversity of strains classified into  <dig> different serotypes, however, only three  are commonly associated with human listeriosis  <cit> . food-stuffs are mainly contaminated by serogroup 1/ <dig> isolates, whereas most human clinical isolates belong to serotype 4b  <cit> , and among these, a small subgroup with unique gene clusters represent the two major epidemic-associated clonal groups  <cit> . in this study, serotype 4b complex was the most common in ruminants , followed by serotype 1/2a . since each pool of faecal material can contain several l. monocytogenes strains with different serotype, these values cannot be interpreted as serotype prevalences but clearly indicate the predominance of serotype 4b in healthy ruminants from the basque country. as part of the usa national animal health monitoring system dairy  <dig> survey, van kessel et al.  <cit>  found a varied distribution of serotypes among l. monocytogenes isolated from cattle bulk tank milk in different regions of the country, with serotype 4b predominating in the southeast and serogroup 1/ <dig> elsewhere  <cit> . serogroup 1/ <dig> was predominant in beef and pork raw minced meat samples from different industries and markets in navarra ; in cattle milk samples, serogroups 1/ <dig> and  <dig> were similarly represented , but in sheep milk  <dig> % of the isolates were serotype 4b  <cit> . conversely, in this study we detected serotype 1/2a at higher proportion in sheep than in cattle. reporting of human listeriosis cases is compulsory in spain and microbiology laboratories at the hospital setting report isolations weekly. a 16-year survey carried out from  <dig> to  <dig> in one of the largest hospitals in the basque country identified  <dig> human clinical cases, with serotype 4b representing 78% of the cases  <cit> , similar to other spanish regions  <cit> . serotype 1/2b, only represented by two dairy cattle isolates in this study, was second  among local human cases, whereas serotype 1/2a, second among animal samples, was the less common among human cases  in the basque country  <cit> . in this context, serotyping is, however, of limited discriminatory value, and techniques like pfge provide enhanced discrimination for outbreak investigations and surveillance purposes. restriction analysis with apai performed on  <dig> isolates generated  <dig> patterns, and provided serotype-specific pfge patterns that clearly separated 1/2a isolates from 4b isolates, and differentiated strains within serotypes. these results confirmed previously established relationships between serotype and pfge patterns  <cit> , and revealed that the l. monocytogenes population in basque farms is genetically highly diverse. in general, isolates from different herds were very different, but occasionally identical or similar patterns were observed in different herds. contact at communal mountain pastures could be an occasion for strain exchange among sheep and beef cattle herds. however, since dairy cattle are confined indoors, the identification of certain patterns in the three production systems or in dairy cattle herds distantly located, suggest other sources of infection. on the other hand, strains differing in more than seven bands, and therefore of limited genetic relatedness  <cit> , were also identified within each herd suggesting multiple sources of contamination.

CONCLUSIONS
listeriosis results in losses to the agricultural economy due to illness and increased infertility and abortion rates, but losses also occur when consumer confidence is undermined as a consequence of food-borne infections. food safety programs that cover all aspects of food production  are needed to provide a safe food supply and prevent foodborne illnesses. identification of on-farm reservoirs is a pre-requisite for the implementation of farm-specific pathogen reduction programs. in this sense, this study showed a high prevalence of l. monocytogenes in ruminant herds compared to swine, suggesting that such herds may represent an important reservoir for l. monocytogenes in the basque country. the wide distribution and variability in l. monocytogenes shed within and among ruminant herds highlighted the complexity of pathogen control at the farm level. the ubiquitous nature of this pathogen hampers its total removal from the farm environment, but a reduction of the intestinal carriage rate in livestock herds would contribute to reduce the contamination pressure at the slaughterhouse and dairy production. in any case, since the relatively high prevalence of l. monocytogenes in ruminant herds does not correlate with the low incidence of human infections in the basque country, it can be speculated that control measures to avoid contamination of final food products are being efficient or, possibly, these could be animal-adapted strains with reduced ability to cause human infections. continuous monitoring schemes and surveillance programs are needed to evaluate trends in the occurrence of l. monocytogenes in livestock and to prevent food contamination.
