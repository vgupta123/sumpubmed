BACKGROUND
salvia miltiorrhiza bunge , known as danshen in chinese, is one of the most important traditional chinese medicine  materials. it has been widely used in chinese medicines treating coronary heart disease, hepatitis, menstrual disorders, menostasis, blood circulation diseases, and other cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . the main bioactive components of s. miltiorrhiza include the water-soluble  phenolics, such as rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid a, salvianolic acid b and lithospermic acid  <cit> , and the lipid-soluble  diterpenoids, known as tanshinones  <cit> . enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of these bioactive components have been intensively studied recently  <cit> . a large number of genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenolics and terpenoids have been identified through either molecular cloning or transcriptome-wide characterization  <cit> . collectively, s. miltiorrhiza is being developed to be a medicinal model plant  <cit> .

transcription factors are a class of significant regulators controlling plant growth and development through regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level. they bind to the specific regions, known as cis-elements, in the promoters of genes and then activate or repress the expression of regulated genes in collaboration with other regulatory factors. so far, two large transcription factor gene families, including the plant-specific squamosa promoter-binding protein-like  transcription factor gene family and the largest plant transcription factor gene family, termed myb, have been characterized in s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> . a total of  <dig> smspls and  <dig> smmybs have been identified from s. miltiorrhiza. smspls are involved in the regulation of developmental timing in s. miltiorrhiza and eight of them are targets of mir156/ <dig>  <cit> . similarly, a subset of smmybs is regulated by micrornas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  many smmybs are involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> .

wrky is a large transcription factor gene family specific to the green lineage, including green algae and land plants. the first wrky gene, known as spf <dig>  was cloned from ipomoea batatas about twenty year ago  <cit> . since then, great progress has been achieved in wrky gene identification and functional analysis. plants with wrkys identified include green alga   <cit> , moss   <cit> , fern   <cit> , pine   <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , tobacco   <cit> , rice   <cit> , soybean   <cit> , maize   <cit> , barley   <cit> , grape   <cit> , poplar   <cit> , tomato   <cit> , cucumber   <cit> , coffee   <cit> , and so forth.

characterization of the identified wrky genes showed that they were significant regulators involved in plant developmental processes and responsed to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the involvement of wrkys in plant immune response against bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens has been widely reported  <cit> . recently, more and more evidence showed the regulatory roles of wrky in plant response to abiotic stresses. for example, over-expression of three soybean wrky genes  in arabidopsis showed that gmwrky21-transgenic arabidopsis plants were tolerant to cold stress, gmwrky <dig> conferred salt and drought tolerance, whereas transgenic plants over-expressing gmwrky <dig> had increased sensitivity to salt and mannitol stresses and decreased sensitivity to abscisic acid  <cit> . it suggests the involvement of wrky genes in multiple abiotic stress-associated signaling pathways and the association of different wrky members with different abiotic stresses. moreover, wrkys associated with same abiotic stress may show different responses. for instance, arabidopsis wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are heat-induced, whereas wrky <dig> is heat-repressed  <cit> . in addition to stress responses, wrkys also regulate various developmental processes, such as seed dormancy and germination, flowing, fruit maturation, stem elongation, pith secondary cell wall formation, plant senescence, and trichome development  <cit> . it suggests the importance of wrkys and the complexity of wrky-associated regulatory networks.

the defining feature of wrky transcription factors is their dna-binding domain, known as wrky domain  <cit> . it is approximately  <dig> amino acids in length and includes the conserved amino acid sequence wrkygqk at the n-terminus and an atypical zinc-finger motif either c2h <dig>  or c2hc  at the c-terminus. the structure of the wrky domain allows it to specifically interact with w-box and sure  cis-elements in the promoter of target genes  <cit> . wrky can be divided into three groups  based on the number of wrky domains  and the pattern of zinc finger motif   <cit> . additionally, group ii wrky proteins can be further divided into subgroups, including iia, iib, iic, iid and iie, based on the primary amino acid sequence of the wrky domain.

although wrkys have been identified and characterized in various plant species, no information is available for the wrky gene family in s. miltiorrhiza. in this study, we cloned and characterized 61 s. miltiorrhiza smwrkys.

RESULTS
molecular cloning of  <dig> smwrky genes from s. miltiorrhiza
it has been shown that  <dig> atwrky genes exist in the arabidopsis genome . to identify smwrkys, blast analysis against the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome was performed using atwrky protein sequences as queries. a total of  <dig> gene models were predicted for smwrkys. the 5’-sequence of many smwrkys showed low homology with known plant wrkys. it might cause errors in computational prediction. to verify the predicted gene models and correct errors of computation, full-length coding sequences  of all  <dig> smwrkys were pcr-amplified using the primers listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> and then cloned and sequenced. it resulted in the identification of  <dig> smwrkys, which were named smwrky1–smwrky <dig>  respectively. the deduced smwrky proteins have amino acid numbers from  <dig> to  <dig>  isoelectric points  from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and molecular weights  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. all of the  <dig> cloned cdss have been submitted to genbank under the accession numbers shown in table  <dig>  the number of identified smwrkys is comparable with that in arabidopsis. comparable gene numbers were also found for the myb  <cit> , spl  <cit> , argonaute   <cit>  and rna-dependent rna polymerase   <cit>  gene families in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis. it suggests that s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis may have similar number tfmkof gene members for many gene families. thus, the identified smwrkys represent an almost complete set of wrkys in s. miltiorrhiza, although it may be not a fully complete set.table  <dig>

classification of the wrky domains and the wrky proteins
transcription factors in a family usually share highly conserved dna-binding domains. in order to examine the phylogenetic relationships among wrkys, a neighbor-joining  phylogenetic tree was constructed for the wrky domain sequences of atwrkys, smwrkys, ppwrkys, gcma and flywch using mega <dig>  . according to the classification of atwrkys, the wrky domains were divided into  <dig> groups . group  <dig> wrky domains come from proteins containing two wrky domains, one of which is located in the n-terminal , while the other one is in the c-terminal . the exceptions within this group are the domains from atwrky <dig> and ppwrky <dig>  each of which possesses a single wrky domain. group  <dig> wrky domains were further divided into two subgroups, termed group 1 n and group 1c, respectively. based on their characteristics in the phylogenetic tree, group  <dig> wrky domains could be classified into  <dig> subgroups, including groups 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e. multiple sequence alignment of the core wrky domains, each of which contains approximately  <dig> residues, showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> wrky domains from  <dig> smwrkys contained the highly conserved sequence wrkygqk, while the other three  had wrkygkk . of the  <dig> smwrky,  <dig> are two-wrky-domain-containing proteins and all of them have the c2h2-type zinc-finger motif  . the other  <dig> smwrky proteins are one-wrky-domain-containing proteins,  <dig> of which contain group  <dig> wrky domains and have the same type of finger motif , while the other  <dig> contain group  <dig> wrky domains and have the c2hc zinc finger motif  . the distribution of residues in the wrky domains of s. miltiorrhiza wrky proteins is quite similar to that of arabidopsis , suggesting evolutionary conservation of smwrkys and atwrkys. comparing the number of smwrkys and atwrkys in each group/subgroup showed that the number of smwrkys in groups  <dig> and  <dig> is similar to that of atwrkys in the same group; however the number  <dig> of smwrky members belonging to group  <dig> is significantly less than the number  <dig> of atwrky members included in the same group. it is consistent with previous results showing group  <dig> wrkys to be a newly defined and most dynamic group  <cit>  and suggests the divergence of wrkys in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis.figure  <dig>

in order to investigate whether the phylogenies are different between the wrky domains and the corresponding wrky proteins, we constructed an nj tree based on the full-length amino acid sequences of smwrkys, atwrkys, ppwrkys, gcma and flywch . the results showed that the phylogenetic tree of wrky proteins was quite similar to the tree of wrky domains with little difference observed . for instance, atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> having two wrky domains and atwrky <dig> belonging to group  <dig> wrky domains form separated clades outside group  <dig>  atwrky <dig> and flywch with the wrky domain belonging to group  <dig>  atwrky <dig> with the wrky domain belonging to group 2e, and atwrky <dig> and gcma with the wrky domain belonging to group  <dig> form separated clades outside groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these results indicate the difference between the wrky domain and the sequence outside the wrky domain. based on the nj tree constructed with full-length amino acid sequences, we identified  <dig> pairs of orthologous wrky genes in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis . it suggests that many smwrkys and atwrkys are evolutionarily conserved.figure  <dig>

analysis of conserved motifs
in addition to the wrky domain, other conserved motifs could be important for the diversified functions of wrky proteins from s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis  <cit> . using the meme program, we identified a total of  <dig> conserved motifs in wrkys from s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis . the length of motifs varies from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and the number of motifs in each wrky varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  the majority of the identified motifs were found in more than one subgroup of wrkys. many atwrkys in a subgroup contain the same motif as their smwrkys orthologues in the subgroup. it suggests the conservation of motifs in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidoopsis wrkys belonging to a subgroup.figure  <dig>

among the  <dig> conserved motifs,  <dig> motifs, including motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  are located in the wrky domain, while the other  <dig> are located outside the domain. most wrky proteins in a group have similar motif compositions . for instance, motif  <dig> exists in almost all of group  <dig> wrky proteins except for smwrky <dig>  motif  <dig> exists in  <dig> of the  <dig> group 1 s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis wrky proteins. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> commonly exist in groups 2a and 2b, two close subgroups in the phylogenetic tree. motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exist in most wrky proteins of group 2b but only in a few members of 2a. motif  <dig> exists in all of the wrky proteins belonging to group 2c. motif  <dig> is shared by proteins belonging to groups 2d and 2e. additionally, motif  <dig>  known as the ca2+-dependent cam-binding domain   <cit> , commonly exists in most wrky proteins belonging to groups 2d and  <dig>  group 2d wrky proteins usually contain two motif 15 s, while the majority of group  <dig> proteins contain only one. motif  <dig>  known as the harf motif  <cit> , exists in  <dig> of  <dig> atwrkys and all  <dig> smwrkys in group 2d. the results indicate functional similarities of wrky proteins belonging to a group. group-specific motifs may attribute to functional divergence of wrkys.

selective constraints on smwrky genes
in order to preliminarily examine the evolutionary mechanism of wrkys, we test the hypothesis of positive selection acting on smwrky genes using site models and branch-site models in paml  <cit>  developed by nielsen and yang  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit> . codon substitution models  <cit>  m <dig>  m1a, m2a, m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> were applied to the alignments and these models assume variation in ω among sites. the parameter estimates, log-likelihood and the lrt tests for these models are shown in table  <dig>  to examine how dn/ds ratios differed among codon positions, we compared models m <dig> and m <dig>  the log likelihood of m <dig> for smwrky sequences was l = − <dig> , with an estimate of ω =  <dig> . the low ω value suggests a strong action of purifying selection in the evolution of smwrky analyzed. m <dig>  assumes a general discrete distribution with three site classes . the log likelihood of m <dig> was l = − <dig> , with an estimate of ω0 =  <dig> , ω1 =  <dig> , ω2 =  <dig>  . consistent with m <dig>  the data from m <dig> also suggest that all codons are under purifying selection. additionally, the value of twice the log likelihood difference  between m <dig> and m <dig> is  <dig> . it is strongly statistically significant  and suggests the overall level of selective constraints fluctuated.table  <dig>

to test whether positive selection promoted divergence between genes, the codon substitution models that allow positive selection  and that hypothesize nearly neutral selection  were compared . the log likelihood of m1a and m2a for smwrky sequences was l = − <dig> . however, no site was positively selected at a level of 95%. m <dig> and m <dig> fitted the sequences better than m <dig>  m <dig>  m1a and m2a with values of l = − <dig>  and − <dig> , respectively . in both cases, no significant evidence of positive selection was found.

branch-site models aim to detect positive selection affecting a few sites along particular lineages and allow ω ratios to vary among sites and lineages simultaneously  <cit> . it seems that the branch-site models are most suitable for describing evolutionary processes of the wrky gene family. therefore, we analyzed positively selected amino acid sites of smwrkys using the improved branch-site model  <cit> . the branches being tested for positive selection were used as the foreground, while all other branches on the tree were used as the background. the bayes empirical bayes  method was used to calculate the posterior probabilities. a codon is probably from the site class of positive selection if lrt suggested the presence of codons under positive selection on the foreground branch  <cit> . the parameter estimates for lineages under positive selection are given in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> residues were found to be under positive selection . it includes  <dig> in group 2c and  <dig> in group 2d. the other three residues were found in group 2b, group 2e and group  <dig>  no residues in group  <dig> and group 2a were found to be under positive selection. the results suggest that different wrky groups may have different evolutionary rates. groups 2c and 2d could be confronted with strong positive darwinian selection, since many highly significant positive sites were detected at the  <dig>  significance level . the evolution in the other groups seems to be more conservative.table  <dig>

functional divergence analysis  of smwrky proteins
using diverge  <dig>  that evaluates shifted evolutionary rate and altered amino acid property after gene duplication  <cit> , we carried out posterior analysis for estimation of type-i and type-ii functional divergence between smwrky clusters. the estimation was based on the wrky protein neighbor-joining tree consisting of three major groups  . comparison among smwrky subgroups showed that all of the coefficients for the type i functional divergence  were greater than zero . the θi values of eight group pairs, including 1/2e, 1/ <dig>  2a + b/2d, 2a + b/2e, 2a + b/ <dig>  2c/2e, 2c/ <dig> and 2d/ <dig>  were ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and were statistically significant  . it indicates that significant site-specific changes may have happened at certain amino acid sites between these group pairs, leading to a subgroup-specific functional evolution after their diversification.

type ii functional divergence  values in six group pairs, including 1/2c, 1/2d, 2a + b/2d, 2c/2d and 2d/ <dig>  were also greater than zero and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . it indicates a radical shift in amino acid properties. in order to extensively reduce positive false, qk >  <dig>  and  <dig>  were empirically used as cutoff in the identification of the type-i and type-ii functional divergence-related residues between gene groups, respectively . detailed analysis showed that the number and the distribution of predicted residues for functional divergence in group pairs were different  and the residues predominantly existed in the wrky domain. it suggests that these residues probably play important roles in functional divergence of wrkys during the evolutionary process.figure  <dig>

tissue-specific expression of smwrkys
it has been shown that a number of wrky proteins are involved in plant developmental processes  <cit> . in order to preliminarily understand the roles of wrkys in s. miltiorrhiza development, we analyzed the expression of smwrkys in roots, stems, leaves and flowers of s. miltiorrhiza plants. all of the  <dig> smwrkys identified were expressed in at least a tissue analyzed and exhibited differential expression patterns . of the  <dig> smwrkys,  <dig>  showed predominant expression in roots,  <dig>  in stems,  <dig>  in leaves and  <dig>  in flowers. the other  <dig>  were mainly expressed in at least two tissues analyzed, indicating these genes are likely to play a more ubiquitous role in s. miltiorrhiza. furthermore, some smwrkys in a group shared similar expression patterns, while the others were not. for example, smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig>  belonging to group  <dig>  were predominantly expressed in roots, while the other group  <dig> members, such as smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig>  were mainly expressed in stems, leaves and flowers, respectively . it suggests that smwrkys belonging to a group do not necessarily indicate their functions in the same tissues. however, it has been shown that the tissues-specific expression patterns appear to be consistent with their role in the tissues. for example, vvwrky <dig>  belonging to group 2c, is involved in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . over-expression of vvwrky <dig> in tobacco resulted in the alteration of expression patterns of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . similarly, smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> in group 2c were predominantly expressed in stems . it indicates the putative roles of these smwrkys in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza. atwrky <dig>  a member of group 2b, and atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig>  two atwrkys in group  <dig>  are an important regulator in senescent leaves  <cit> . of them, atwrky <dig> acts in the upstream of sirk during leaf senescence  <cit> . smwrky <dig> belonging to the same wrky group of atwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> included in group  <dig> could be regulators of leaf senescence in s. miltiorrhiza, since both of them showed predominant expression in leaves . it has been shown that atwrky <dig> included in group  <dig> is involved in trichome differentiation  <cit> . several smwrkys in group  <dig>  such as smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig>  were highly expressed in roots with abundant root hairs, and smwrky <dig> belonging to the same group was highly expressed in leaves with abundant of trichomes . it implies that these smwrky may be associated with trichome development in s. miltiorrhiza.figure  <dig>

methyl jasmonate -responsive smwrkys
meja is a key signaling molecule involved in plant response to stress and in regulating secondary metabolite production in many plant species, including s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> . more than 50%  of atwrkys were meja-responsive in arabidopsis  <cit> . more than 1/ <dig> of crwrky were regulated by meja in hairy roots of catharanthus roseus  <cit> . additionally, cawrky <dig> in capsicum annuum  <cit> , gbwrky <dig> in gossypium barbadense  <cit>  and ghwrky <dig> in gossypium hirsutum  <cit>  were also regulated by meja. in order to test whether wrkys were responsive to meja treatment in s. miltiorrhiza, the expression level of smwrkys in roots of plantlets treated with meja was analyzed using the quantitative rt-pcr method. meja treatment showed a wide variety of smwrky gene expression profiles . significant expression level changes were observed for  <dig> smwrkys, of which  <dig> were up-regulated,  <dig> were down-regulated, while the other  <dig>  including smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig>  were either up-regulated or down-regulated at different time-points of treatment . it suggests that about 80% of the smwrkys analyzed are meja-responsive. examination of the number of smwrkys with significant expression level changed at different time-points of treatment showed that the expression of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> smwrkys was changed after meja treatment for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 hours, respectively . it suggests that the majority of smwrkys have altered expression levels at the time-point of 24 h-treatment. the number of up-regulated smwrkys was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> at the time-point of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 hours, respectively, while that of down-regulated was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. additionally,  <dig> smwrkys, including smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig>  were significantly up-regulated at all time-points of meja treatment, while  <dig>  including smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig>  were down-regulated . it suggests that the number of up-regulated smwrkys is slightly more than down-regulated.figure  <dig>

yeast extract and ag+-responsive smwrkys
in order to further investigate the roles of smwrkys in s. miltiorrhiza, transcriptome-wide analysis of smwrky expression in response to yeast extract and ag+ treatment was performed. rna-seq data of s. miltiorrhiza hairy roots treated with or without yeast extract  and ag+  were downloaded from genbank under the accession number srr <dig>  <cit> . rna-seq reads from non-treated  and treated for 12 h , 24 h  and 36 h  were mapped to smwrkys using the soap <dig> software  <cit> . the log-2-transformed rpkm  value of smwrkys varied between − <dig>  and  <dig>  . using a cutoff of rpkm value > <dig> , a total of  <dig> smwrkys were found to be expressed in hairy roots. fisher’s exact test showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> smwrkys were differentially expressed . it includes  <dig> significantly up-regulated,  <dig> significantly down-regulated and  <dig> significantly up- or down-regulated at different time-points, suggesting the majority of the identified smwrkys were responsive to yeast extract and ag+ treatment.

smwrky candidates potentially involved in tanshinone biosynthesis
terpenoids are plant secondary metabolites with significant physiological and ecological functions and great economic values, and a class of terpenoids, known as tanshinones, is the main bioactive compounds in s. miltiorrhiza. increasing evidence demonstrates the importance of wrky genes in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoid indole alkaloid in catharanthus roseus  <cit> . additionally, it has been shown that gossypium arboretum gawrky <dig>  which belongs to group 2a, participates in sesquiterpene biosynthesis in cotton by controlling -δ-cadinene synthase  activity  <cit> . pqwrky <dig>  a member of group 2d, responds to meja treatment and is a positive regulator of osmotic stress response and triterpene ginsenoside biosynthesis in panax quinquefolius  <cit> . aawrky <dig> and crwrky, belonging to group  <dig>  are the other two terpenoid biosynthesis-related wrkys. artemisia annua aawrky <dig> was highly expressed in glandular secretory trichomes , where the sesquiterpene artemisinin was synthesized  <cit> . aawrky <dig> might be strongly induced by meja and could bind to the w-box in the promoter of ads gene encoding amorpha- <dig>  11-diene synthase, a key enzyme in the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . crwrky <dig> was preferentially expressed in roots of c. roseus and also induced by meja  <cit> . it controlled terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis through positive regulation of dxs and sls genes involved in the terpenoid pathway and as and tdc genes involved in the indole pathway  <cit> . thus, smwrkys included in group 2a, 2d and  <dig> probably have an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza.

terpenoid tanshinones have been mainly produced and accumulated in roots of field-grown s. miltiorrhiza during the fast growing period from june to september  <cit> . the process of tanshinone production may be stimulated by meja, yeast extract and ag+  <cit> . among the  <dig> identified smwrkys, sixteen showed similar responses to the meja treatment and the yeast extract and ag+ treatment . smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> were up-regulated by both the meja treatment and the yeast extract and ag+ treatment, while smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> were down-regulated . among the sixteen smwrkys, eight, including six up-regulated  and two down-regulated , were predominantly expressed in roots of field-grown s. miltiorrhiza in august , suggesting their specific roles in roots. smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> are members of groups  <dig>  2d, 2a and 2b, respectively, while smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig>  smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> are members of group 2c . thus, smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> are two smwrkys  with similar responses to the meja treatment and the yeast extract and ag+ treatment,  having root-specific expression, and  belonging to group 2a, 2d or  <dig> with members probably playing an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis. it implicates that smwrky <dig> and smwrky <dig> are very likely to be activators in tanshinone production. notably, we may not exclude the possibility that some other smwrkys are also involved in tanshinone biosynthesis based on the data currently available. further analysis of transgenic s. miltiorrhiza plants with over-expressed or silenced smwrkys may help to elucidate their function.

divergence of paralogous smwrky genes
gene duplication is an important event for gene family expansion and functional diversity during evolution  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  smwrky genes appear to be duplicated . in order to preliminarily reveal the mechanism of functional diversity  of these genes after duplication, the synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rate were calculated using the cds of paralogous smwrky genes . the ka/ks ratios for all of the  <dig> paralogous smwrky gene pairs were less than one with  <dig> pairs even close to zero. it suggests that the wrky genes from s. miltiorrhiza have experienced strong purifying selection pressure. some closely related gene pairs displayed different expression patterns, indicating functional divergences occurred. for example, smwrky <dig> was expressed dominantly in leaves, whereas the other member of the smwrky13/smwrky <dig> gene pair, smwrky <dig>  was expressed mainly in roots and stems . in addition, smwrky <dig>  but not smwrky <dig>  was significantly up-regulated by meja . expression patterns of other paralogous genes, such as smwrky23/ <dig>  smwrky30/ <dig>  smwrky41/ <dig>  smwrky42/ <dig>  and smwrky43/smwrky <dig>  were also different . it indicates that many smwrky gene pairs are divergent under the purifying pressure  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we cloned a total of  <dig> smwrky genes. the cloned genes and the deduced proteins were characterized through a comprehensive approach, including phylogenetic tree construction, wrky domain characterization, conserved motif identification, selective constraint analysis, functional divergence analysis, and expression profiling. we showed that many smwrkys and atwrkys were evolutionarily conserved. the wrky domains could be divided into  <dig> groups  and  <dig> subgroups . each group of wrky domains contains characteristic conserved sequences. additionally, sequence outside the wrky domain might contribute to the difference between the phylogenetic tree constructed with the wrky domains and that constructed with the whole wrky proteins. a total of  <dig> conserved motifs were identified, of which group-specific motifs might attribute to functional divergence of wrkys. we identified  <dig> pairs of orthologous smwrky and atwrky genes and  <dig> pairs of paralogous smwrky genes. selective constraint analysis and functional divergence analysis showed that the smwrky subgroup genes have experienced strong positive selection and diverged in function. gene expression profiles suggest that the majority of  <dig> smwrky genes are tissue-specific and meja- and yeast extract and ag+-responsive. these results provide insights into functional conservation and diversification of smwrkys and are useful for further investigating smwrky functions in s. miltiorrhiza development and defense response.
