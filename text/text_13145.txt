BACKGROUND
the human body is naturally colonised by a diverse array of micro-organisms whose metabolic activity is important for human physiology and health  <cit> . most studies that assess the functional potentials and controls of these complex communities rely on:  the characterisation of individual isolates or enrichments,  quantification of micro-organisms that are thought to mediate a certain process, or  metagenomic analysis of a certain body region. established methods of microbial ecology that allow the direct measurement of metabolic conversions in natural microbial samples from humans under different experimental conditions, such as incubation with isotopically-labelled substrates, dye probes for specific compounds combined with microscopy or electrochemical microsensors, are rarely reported. however, different microbial pathways, including fermentation, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and acetogenesis  <cit> , have been proposed to occur in humans. surprisingly, denitrification  or nitrite  via nitric oxide  to nitrous oxide  or dinitrogen   <cit> ) is believed to be insignificant in human-associated microbial communities  <cit> , even though no3- and no2- co-occur in significant concentrations with micro-organisms in various body regions, such as the human oral cavity  <cit> .

denitrification is performed by facultative anaerobic micro-organisms and is coupled to the oxidation of reduced organic carbon or reduced inorganic compounds, such as ferrous iron, hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen  <cit> . the reductive sequence  of denitrification is mediated by periplasmic and membrane-bound enzymes specific for each step. the most important genes for the detection of denitrification in complex microbial samples are narg for no3- reductase, nirs and nirk for no2- reductases, qnorb or cnorb for no reductases, and nosz for n2o reductase. denitrifying bacteria release no or n2o as intermediates during metabolic activity in pure culture  <cit>  and in complex microbial communities, such as soils  <cit> , nitrogen cycling biofilms  <cit>  and ingested bacteria within different invertebrates guts  <cit> .

notably, human saliva contains no3- concentrations in the millimolar range, because dietary no3- is concentrated in salivary glands after it is absorbed from the intestine into the blood  <cit> . thus, the human-associated microbial biofilm community of dental plaque and bacteria that cover other oral surfaces are exposed to no3-. however, investigations of plaque metabolism have focused on aerobic respiration and acid fermentation of carbohydrates  <cit> . experiments with rat tongues as well as tooth and other surfaces in the human mouth have shown that salivary no3- can be converted by oral micro-organisms to no2-, explaining the presence of no2- in addition to no3- in saliva  <cit> . detection of no in air incubated in the human mouth has led to the hypothesis that bacterially-derived salivary no2- is chemically reduced to no in acidic microenvironments in the oral cavity  <cit> . the underlying processes have never been directly demonstrated because no could not be measured in dental biofilms over relevant spatial scales. therefore, other investigators considered no2- in human saliva a stable oxidation product of no synthase-derived no that is produced by gingival cells to regulate the gum immune and vascular systems  <cit> .

due to the possible formation of no, plaque nitrogen metabolism might be important to dental health. dental plaque causes periodontal diseases and dental caries, affecting almost every human being  <cit> . as an inflammatory disorder of gum tissue surrounding the teeth, periodontal diseases might be especially affected by nitrogen metabolism of dental plaque, if no is generated as a side product at the gum-plaque interface. no plays a complex, but not well understood role in periodontal diseases  <cit> . no, at low concentrations, is an important signalling molecule that coordinates functions of immune system cells that are involved in inflammatory processes  <cit> . bacterial lipopolysaccharides stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines, which induce production of high, cytotoxic no concentrations by certain immune system cells. furthermore, high no levels during inflammation induce expression of matrix metalloproteinases in neutrophiles, which mediate soft tissue degradation  <cit> .

besides its potential importance to dental health, oral nitrogen metabolism is important for human physiology  <cit> . the formation of no2- as a denitrification intermediate by oral micro-organisms leads to chemical conversion of no2- to no in the acidic stomach, acting as an antimicrobial agent against pathogenic bacteria and stimulating gastric blood flow. moreover, no2- is absorbed into plasma, where it serves as a no source for the regulation of vasodilatation under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . it is still unclear whether microbial nitrogen metabolism in human dental plaque is significant in comparison to other oral surfaces.

in the present study, we hypothesise that dental plaque represents a habitat for microbial denitrification in humans, driving the biological conversion of salivary no3- to the denitrification intermediates no and n2o, and to the final product n <dig>  we use direct microbial ecology methods, including a recently developed no microsensor  <cit> , to demonstrate in situ no formation during denitrification in dental plaque and to show that no is formed at concentrations that are significant for signalling to host tissue. in addition, we aim to show the in vivo significance of plaque denitrification for the formation of denitrification intermediates by correlating the oral accumulation of n2o in humans to salivary no3-/no2- concentrations and to the presence of plaque.

RESULTS
dental plaque mediates aerobic denitrification
dental plaque converted no3- to n <dig> by denitrification. this was shown by 30n <dig> formation from 15no3- during incubation of dispersed dental plaque . the occurrence of complete denitrification in dental biofilms was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction  detection of all genes  that are necessary for the respiratory reduction of no3- to n <dig> . genes for respiratory no reductases were restricted to the presence of the quinol-dependent type , but not of the cytochrome c-dependent type .

results are based on detection of a pcr product with the expected size or on the additional analysis of the sequence of the pcr product.

two lines of evidence suggested that denitrification in dental biofilms occurred under aerobic conditions. first, we observed 30n <dig> production from plaque that was suspended in air-saturated medium amended with  <dig> μm 15no3- . o <dig> measurements in this medium showed that aerobic heterotrophic respiration did not lead to anoxic conditions during the incubation period . second, microsensor measurements showed that no3- was consumed in the presence of o <dig> and that also the denitrification intermediates no and n2o were formed in the presence of o <dig> . at this low no3- concentration it is conceivable that all no3- was used for assimilation into biomass, and was thus not available for respiratory denitrification. however, in this plaque sample no3- was not completely consumed  when present at a concentration of  <dig> μm no3- . thus, no3- assimilation and denitrification must have been already present at their maximum capacity at  <dig> μm no3-. further increases of the no3- concentration to  <dig> μm will most likely not change the contribution of both pathways to the total no3- uptake. in turn, the biofilm remained oxic when subjected to  <dig> μm no3- and produced the denitrification intermediates no and n2o  indicating that aerobic denitrification was also active at high no3- concentrations.

chemical and biological no and n2o formation during plaque denitrification is ph dependent
no3- was the source for no and n2o in dental biofilms. this was shown by no and n2o formation being restricted to the presence of no3- . no formation in dental biofilms was mediated by both biological no2- reduction and presumably acidic decomposition of no2-. biological no2- reduction was the sole process that produced no when the medium was buffered at approximately ph  <dig>  in non-buffered medium, bacterial activity decreased biofilm ph <  <dig>  and depth-averaged no concentrations increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm . titration of  <dig> μm no2- to a buffer at ph  <dig>  showed that acidic decomposition of no2- caused chemical formation of approximately  <dig>  μm no , which is in the same range than the observed increase in the biofilm at ph <  <dig>  it is already known that plaque can form no2- by no3- reduction  <cit> . no2- can also naturally accumulate in saliva to concentrations of  <dig> μm and higher . taken together, this suggests that acidic decomposition of no2- contributes to no formation at low plaque ph levels, while biological no formation may still occur in parallel.

the absolute increase of no due to acidic conditions was small from the perspective of the metabolic homeostasis of denitrification. this was evident because depth-averaged increases of n2o, the product of no reduction, were approximately two orders of magnitude higher than those of no concentrations under acidic conditions. this suggests that biofilm bacteria efficiently convert most no to n2o and thereby keep the steady-state concentration of cytotoxic no low, as has been also observed in environmental biofilms  <cit> .

no formation decreases o <dig> uptake of dental plaque
oxygen uptake in the presence of no3- was higher at neutral ph than under acidic conditions . the o <dig> profiles showed that the flux of o <dig> decreased by 50%, namely from - <dig> nmol/cm2/h under buffered conditions to - <dig> nmol/cm2/h under non-buffered conditions. acidic ph alone did not lead to reduced o <dig> uptake when no3- was absent, as the o <dig> flux was - <dig> nmol/cm2/h. decreased bacterial o <dig> consumption might result from direct toxic effects of the highest no concentration , such as binding of no to terminal, respiratory o <dig> reductases  <cit> . however, the absolute increase from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm may not affect respiration as concentrations above  <dig>  μm were previously shown to be necessary to inhibit o <dig> reduction in escherichia coli  <cit> . in addition, instead of facilitating o <dig> reduction, a small fraction of electrons might be used preferentially for detoxification of no by reduction to n2o, contributing to increased n2o concentrations and inhibited o <dig> uptake .

n2o production in the human mouth is dependent on salivary no3- and on the presence of dental plaque
we incubated air in the human mouth  and measured the rate of n2o accumulation to quantify the in vivo significance of denitrification in the oral habitat. we related n2o accumulation in mouth air to the presence of dental biofilms and salivary no3-/no2- concentrations . n2o accumulation in the presence of dental plaque varied strongly between the subjects and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nmol/h. n2o accumulation between subjects increased with increasing salivary no3-/no2- concentrations . drinking  <dig> ml beetroot juice that contained  <dig> mmol/l no3- increased the salivary no3-/no2- concentrations, which led to an increase of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold in the rate of oral n2o accumulation.

dental biofilms were the main sites of n2o production in the human mouth. this was evident because the combined application of ordinary tooth brushing with an antiseptic mouthwash decreased oral n2o accumulation rate by 82%, while tooth brushing alone decreased the rate of oral n2o accumulation by 62% .

discussion
our data show unambiguously that denitrification is a relevant process in a human associated microbial community. until now, it was assumed that complete no3- reduction in humans is restricted to the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium , because most bacterial isolates from humans are able to perform this reaction  <cit> . dnra is known to be a strictly anaerobic process that is favoured over denitrification in anaerobic, reduced environments  <cit> . accordingly, dnra might prevail in the reduced, anaerobic environment of the human gut, while denitrification is present in the more oxidised dental plaque. in turn, it is conceivable that dnra is present in plaque that is recalcitrant to removal and thus, constantly anoxic and more reduced. theoretically, in such biofilms no2- reduction might be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium  , especially if protein degradation of host tissue or dnra could provide a source for ammonium, as has been reported in marine open water habitats  <cit> . denitrification, however, might be present in other oxidised environments in humans where bacteria and no3- co-occur. for example, no3- is also present in other body fluids than saliva that may provide a rather oxidised environment   <cit> . thus, denitrification might be relevant in microbial biofilms that are associated to other diseased or healthy sites, such as cystic fibrosis lungs, otitis media ears, implants, catheters and vaginal mucosa  <cit> .

denitrification and dnra are fundamentally different with respect to their final products, metabolic controls and released intermediates resulting in different effects on host physiology. ammonium, the final product of dnra, is available to host cells and associated microbes as a form of fixed nitrogen. moreover, dnra in humans may accumulate ammonium to detrimental concentrations  <cit> . in contrast, n <dig>  the final product of denitrification, represents a loss of fixed nitrogen from the host and does not affect human cells. furthermore, production of the signalling molecule no by microbial denitrification might shape the interactions between the host cells and their associated microbial community.

interestingly, denitrification in dental biofilms occurred under aerobic conditions. this shows that dental plaque does not necessarily have to display anoxic microsites for denitrification to occur. the ability to denitrify in the presence of o <dig> has been observed for isolated bacterial strains and occasionally for microbial communities  <cit> . aerobic denitrification guarantees a stable electron accepting process in a no3--rich habitat exposed to frequent fluctuations in o <dig> concentration without energy-demanding expression of new enzyme systems  <cit> . this may perfectly apply to the oral habitat that is characterised by high salivary no3- and potentially fluctuating o <dig> concentrations in the mouth.

despite the microbial diversity of dental biofilms  <cit> , we could only detect genes for respiratory no reductases of the quinol-dependent type , but not of the cytochrome c-dependent type . interestingly, genes that code for qnorb are also found in non-denitrifying, pathogenic bacteria, where it contributes to no detoxification, instead of respiratory electron transport  <cit> . apparently, respiratory no reduction is exclusively mediated by qnorb in the investigated dental biofilms. additionally, qnorb might be used as a protective enzyme against toxic no derived from host cells, acidic decomposition of no2- and other biofilm bacteria.

our results allowed us to formulate a mechanistic model for nitrogen conversions in dental plaque . first, reduction of salivary no3- leads to the formation of no2-  <cit> , which is further denitrified to form the intermediates no and n2o and finally n <dig> . the mechanistic model involves a ph-controlled chemical conversion step from no2- to no in addition to the biological conversion step . the chemical conversion of no2- to no occurs if acid fermentation decreases plaque ph <  <dig>  high turnover of no under acidic conditions leads to decreased o <dig> uptake in dental biofilms. this argues toward an no-mediated metabolic coupling of different microbial activities in dental plaque. moreover, bacteria respond to no as a signalling molecule. specifically, no is involved in the dispersal of bacteria from biofilms  <cit> . together this makes no a possible bacterially-derived factor that balances the development of a natural dental plaque community. thus, no might be an important factor from the perspective of the 'ecological plaque hypothesis', which states that environmental factors  in the mouth determine if the dental plaque microbial community is dominated by either health-sustaining or disease-causing micro-organisms  <cit> .

human cells can produce no from arginine by no synthase activity and respond to no as a signal molecule produced by other cells  <cit> . in gingival tissue, no is known to be involved in blood pressure regulation and in inflammatory processes, such as those in periodontal diseases  <cit> . under acidic conditions, the depth-averaged no concentration in dental plaque increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm , which is in a physiological effective range  <cit>  for local blood pressure regulation, neurosignalling events and immune system modulation in tissues close to plaque. hence, we hypothesise that ph fluctuations and plaque denitrification may locally affect blood flow, signalling between nerves, and inflammatory processes in the gum by modulating the concentration of no . no-mediated interactions will be different in cariogenic as compared to periodontal plaque, because both are characterised by distinct ph regimes  <cit> . while low ph levels in cariogenic plaque may induce chemical no formation leading to high no concentrations, no formation in periodontal plaque will be restricted to microbial processes, because it is characterised by ph levels >  <dig>  as discussed above, microbial denitrification might be relevant in other healthy and diseased sites of the body. thus more generally, microbial denitrification might be considered an alternative route for no formation in humans and provides a basis for symbiotic interactions between human-associated microbes and adjacent host cells.

the presence of dental plaque caused accumulation of n2o, as an intermediate of denitrification, in mouth air depending on salivary no3- concentrations. this demonstrates that denitrification occurs in vivo and that dietary no3--uptake influences plaque denitrification. the average rate of oral n2o emission from  <dig> volunteers with unbrushed teeth and non-manipulated salivary no3-/no2- concentrations was  <dig> nmol/h. while earlier investigations of the breath air of human beings revealed n2o concentrations above the ambient atmospheric level  <cit> , our study presents the first oral-associated emission rates of this greenhouse gas  <cit>  by humans. extrapolating our data to the world population of currently  <dig>  billion people, oral-associated n2o emission by humans is  <dig>  tg n/a, representing an insignificant amount of  <dig> % of the total, annual n2o emission of  <dig>  tg n/a to the atmosphere  <cit> .

dental biofilms were the main sites of n2o production in the human mouth. this result and the microsensor data strongly suggest that dental plaque is also the main site for oral formation of the other denitrification intermediates no2- and no. thus, no2- measurements in saliva  <cit>  are not an adequate proxy for no formation by human host cells in the mouth . moreover, plaque denitrification needs to be considered when using no and no2- measurements in breath and saliva to diagnose systemic diseases, such as renal failure  <cit>  and cystic fibrosis  <cit> . more generally, the importance of dental plaque for the formation of denitrification intermediates as compared to other oral surfaces indicates that plaque bacteria are as important for oral nitrogen conversions than bacteria located on other oral surfaces  <cit> . consequently, dental biofilms and salivary no3- concentrations play a crucial role in the regulation of body no2- concentration and affect no2--related physiological functions in the human body, such as hypoxic vasodilatation and antimicrobial activity in the acidic stomach   <cit> .

numerous anatomical sites, including the skin, mouth, stomach, colon, and vagina, are inhabited by distinct microbial communities, which are characterised by a large diversity. this suggests a versatile potential of different metabolic pathways mediated by micro-organisms that affect human physiology. however, activities or the functional potentials of complex human-associated microbial communities have rarely been investigated  <cit> . thus, we anticipate that investigations of human-associated microbial communities with techniques that measure their in situ activities will lead to the discovery of unexpected functions and interactions between microbes and humans if expanded to elemental cycles of carbon, sulfur, iron and others. the microbial ecology toolbox available for these experiments comprises techniques, such as microsensors, and isotopic or radioactive labelling with detection in bulk medium and on a single cell level, all of which can be combined with phylogenetic identification  <cit> . this ecophysiological approach will allow the direct testing of hypotheses that emerge from metagenomic data that is generated in the context of the human microbiome project  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
human dental plaque mediates denitrification based on salivary no3-. plaque denitrification is performed under aerobic conditions and leads to biological and chemical no and n2o formation in a ph-dependent manner. plaque o <dig> uptake is inhibited by no. thus, formation of no mediates metabolic interactions between plaque bacteria. moreover, no is produced at concentration levels that allow signalling to human host cells, pointing toward a significant role in the regulation of inflammatory disorders of gum tissue . microbial denitrification is, besides no synthase activity and acidic decomposition of no2-, an alternative pathway of no formation in humans. denitrification in dental plaque is a relevant site for production of intermediates of nitrogen cycling in the human mouth and is dependent on salivary no3-. thus, breath analysis for the detection of systemic diseases should consider plaque activity, and denitrification in dental plaque may affect the physiology of the whole human body.
