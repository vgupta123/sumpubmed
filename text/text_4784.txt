BACKGROUND
most aerial loranthaceae mistletoes use bird vectors for seed dispersal and, eventually, branch attachment and penetration of woody host plants  <cit> . given their close affinities with their dispersal vectors and the connections with and dependence on their hosts  <cit> , the mistletoe geographical ranges are directly related to the morphological and behavioral adaptations of mistletoe fruit specialists and the availability of suitable host trees. however, most avian vectors of mistletoe parasites do not seem to be sufficiently specialized to isolate mistletoe populations on different hosts  and, therefore, the genetic structuring of mistletoe populations is likely more influenced by the geographic structuring of host populations .

research on mistletoe evolution has highlighted the importance of host specialization during speciation , which can occur in three ways:  mistletoe co-speciation with their hosts ,  mistletoe speciation by changing host specificity , and  mistletoe speciation without changes in the host . each of these modes of mistletoe speciation could occur following the allopatric, peripheral isolates or sympatric models of speciation  <cit> . psittacanthus mart.  mistletoes show a variety of patterns of host specificity from specialist to generalist  <cit> . for example, three species with allopatric distribution in mesoamerica, p. angustifolius , p. macrantherus  and p. pinicola , parasitize exclusively species of pinus and abies  <cit> , while p. sonorae , p. nudus  and p. palmeri  parasitize almost exclusively species of bursera, and p. auriculatus  and p. breedlovei  parasitize acacia species and other legumes  <cit> . in contrast, other psittacanthus species widely distributed in mesoamerica often in sympatry parasitize distantly related host species . that is, there is a tendency among psittacanthus mistletoes that infect more than one host species to infect distantly related hosts and their ranges overlap, whereas psittacanthus species that infect closely related host species have allopatric distributions.

the tendency for closely related mistletoes to infect closely related host species supports the model of mistletoe co-speciation with their hosts . in contrast, host specialization might play an important role in speciation to occur among species of mistletoes using several host species, and mistletoe speciation in sympatry would occur by changing host specificity  leading to specialization on different hosts and the formation of mistletoe races. if a mistletoe species utilizes two or more host species, the genetic pool of the mistletoe species may become differentiated into “host races,” which may eventually diverge into new species .

the existence of host-specific relationships through cross-dispersal experiments has been suggested as evidence for the presence of host-specific races in a number of mistletoe species , or by using genetic markers, including isozymes , aflps  <cit>  and chloroplast dna sequences  <cit> . cross-dispersal experiments have shown that seedling development is greatest when mistletoe seeds are placed on their source host species . using genetic data, however, the distinct host races identified were geographically isolated by some distance  or the phylogeographic groups were best explained by isolation linked to pliocene geological events and pleistocene climate changes  <cit> , which makes it difficult to distinguish between the potential effects of isolation and those linked to changes in host-tree availability on population divergence.

a phylogeographic approach is appropriate for evolutionary studies of mistletoes, because the assessment of geographic structure and genetic variation within and among populations might reflect underlying spatial and/or temporal discontinuities in available host tree species. despite the appeal of the speciation model of host race formation by host switching, species formation in mistletoes that are transmitted between hosts by avian vectors is not understood. speciation via race formation is thought to be the result of ecological adaptation to host taxa, and presumably the evolutionary pathway that eventually lead to mistletoe diversification  <cit> . however, other factors could also contribute to explain genetic structuring of mistletoe populations particularly when mistletoe “host races” are distributed allopatrically. it may occur when gene flow between conspecific populations is diminished because of the synergistic effects of both paleogeographical events and pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles that, coupled with the complex interactions between mistletoes and their tree hosts, pollinators and seed dispersers, could have shaped at different time scales the distribution and genetic structure of species in a region .

here the evolutionary history of psittacanthus schiedeanus  g. don  is examined through species distribution modeling and phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of nuclear and chloroplast dna. we used a broad geographical sampling of populations of p. schiedeanus dna sequences from the internal transcribed spacer  region of the nuclear ribosomal dna  in combination with sequences of the rapidly evolving trnl-f intergenic spacer region from the chloroplast genome . this multilocus approach allowed us to explicitly test the set of historical and climatic scenarios in the evolution of p. schiedeanus and identify patterns of population structure that may reflect the evolutionary history of the species. as the chloroplast genome is maternally inherited in most angiosperms, cpdna sequences may provide a picture of evolutionary haplotype relationships of seed-mediated gene flow compared to the its sequences reflecting a combination of both pollen and seed movement  <cit> . specifically, we address the following questions:  does the phylogeography of p. schiedeanus based on nuclear and chloroplast markers support a vicariance model in which major geographic disjunctions  or historical fragmentation of cloud forest distribution correspond with genetic diversification?  are the phylogeographic patterns concordant between the two types of markers?  does niche modeling also support the vicariance model, and does the proposed patterns of suitable habitat distribution though pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles match those suggested by phylogeography? and , does the phylogeography of p. schiedeanus support the model of ecological speciation due to host-specificity, and does this reflect the observed host population expansion/contraction events historically related to the availability of suitable host trees?

methods
study system
psittacanthus schiedeanus mistletoes have yellow-to-orange, self-compatible hermaphroditic flowers pollinated mainly by hummingbirds  <cit> , and ripe purplish-black, lipid-rich, fleshy  fruits dispersed by a variety of birds  <cit> . these mistletoes are characteristic of the canopy in the cloud forests edges in northern mesoamerica, here delineated from northeastern mexico to the guatemalan highlands  <cit> . the northern boundary of the region comprises cloud forests along the sierra madre oriental, from southern tamaulipas to northern oaxaca. the southern boundary includes cloud forests in the sierra madre de chiapas, central highlands of chiapas, and in the sierra de las minas and sierra de cuchumatanes in guatemala . between these boundaries, cloud forests encompass an extremely heterogeneous mixture of north american temperate tree species that are present in the region since the tertiary and tropical species with south american origins during the early miocene .

psittacanthus schiedeanus often parasitizes more than  <dig> host tree species, introduced to or native to cloud forests . in central veracruz, the most severe infections occur on liquidambar styraciflua  <cit> , a temperate tree species present in mesoamerica as early as the late miocene  <cit> . a phylogeographic study in l. styraciflua revealed breaks between populations in the deciduous forests of the southeastern usa and the mesoamerican cloud forests, populations distributed north and south of the trans-mexican volcanic belt , and private haplotypes for populations in the cloud forest of the sierra de los tuxtlas  <cit> . the genetic divergence between l. styraciflua populations distributed north and south of the tmvb occurred  <dig> – <dig>  million years ago  during the formation of the pliocene to quaternary volcanic arc, one of the most recent episodes of the geologic evolution of the tmvb , and subsequent climatic changes in the region. ruiz-sanchez and ornelas  <cit>  also found signals of demographic expansion during the last glacial maximum  in the mesoamerican populations of l. styraciflua that presumably connected and expanded to lower coastal areas. given that the geographic structuring of host populations must influence the genetic structuring of mistletoe populations, the current distribution range and phylogeographic structure of p. schiedeanus populations should reflect the observed host population expansion/contraction events historically related to the availability of suitable host trees. however, this hemiparasitic mistletoe may not track their l. styraciflua hosts during range expansions and contractions linked to pleistocene climate changes because it lives on several host tree species  and, as a consequence, its distribution range was not influenced by geographical host range changes during glacial/interglacial periods.

samples and dna sequencing
leaf tissue samples were collected from  <dig> individuals on a variety of host tree species in  <dig> populations throughout the species range in mexico . target sampling localities were chosen based on localities of occurrence data acquired from kuijt  <cit> . psittacanthus schiedeanus can be relatively easy to identify in the summer time because of its conspicuous and long flowers. however, it is an extremely variable species in flower and leaf morphology sometimes difficult to separate from sympatric p. calyculatus  <cit> , even though its typical form west of the isthmus of tehuantepec has much longer and more slender flowers  <cit>  and p. angustifolius with narrow leaves similar to occasional individuals of p. schiedeanus but prefers pinus chiapensis as host at higher elevations in chiapas and pinus oocarpa in honduras  <cit> , and from p. mayanus , p. breedlovei  and p. minor  allopatrically distributed in tropical deciduous forests mainly on acacia host trees at lower elevations  <cit> . therefore, our geographic sampling scheme includes populations considered phenotypically p. schiedeanus along the cloud forest distribution and samples phenotypically similar to p. schiedeanus of adjacent populations regardless of taxonomy, focusing on those distributed in central oaxaca  and chiapas . most populations collected have an accompanying voucher that is deposited at the xal herbarium of the instituto de ecología, ac  . only one p. schiedeanus plant was sampled per individual host tree.

leaf tissue samples were preserved in silica gel desiccant until dna extractions were performed. we additionally obtained leaf samples for dna sequencing from other psittacanthus species  and downloaded dna sequences from the genbank of representatives of loranthaceae tribes to be used as outgroups: nuytsia floribunda , atkinsonia ligustrina , gaiadendron punctatum , peraxilla tetrapetalla , alepis flavida , desmaria mutabilis , phthirusa pyrifolia , oryctanthus occidentalis , tupeia antarctica , phragmanthera regularis , tristerix corymbosus , tristerix aphyllus , tripodanthus acutifolius , notanthera heterophylla , ligaria cuneifolia , cladocolea cupulata , cladocolea mcvaughii  and struthanthus orbicularis  from wilson and calvin  <cit> , amico et al.  <cit>  and vidal-russell and nickrent  <cit> .

total genomic dna was extracted from silica-dried material using a modified 2 × cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide  protocol  <cit>  or the dneasy plant mini kit  using the manufacturer protocol. amplification of the nrdna its region was conducted with the primers its5hp  <cit>  and its <dig>  <cit> , whereas for trnl-f intergenic spacer region we used the universal primers e and f  <cit> . for targeting successful of its region sequencing, we used the primers its-f2-psitta  and its-r2-psitta  designed for this study. the 25–μl its pcr mix contained 5 μl of 5 × buffer ,  <dig>  μl mgcl <dig> , 2 μl dntps mix ,  <dig>  μl of each primer ,  <dig>  μl taq polymerase  , 2 μl of dmso ,  <dig> –3 μl of template dna, and finally dh2o added to bring to volume. the 25–μl trnl-f pcr mix contained  <dig>  μl of 5 × buffer ,  <dig>  μl mgcl <dig> , 2 μl dntps mix ,  <dig>  μl of each primer ,  <dig>  μl taq polymerase  ,  <dig> –3 μl of template dna, and finally dh2o added to bring to volume. pcrs of its consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °c for 4 min, followed by 5 cycles of 94 °c for 1 min, 50 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 45–52 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 1 min, and a final step of 72 °c for 7 min. chloroplast  amplifications used the following profile: initial denaturation at 95 °c for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °c for 10 s, 55 °c for 1 min, 72 °c for 20 s, and a final step of 72 °c for 7 min. pcr products were purified with the qiaquick kit  and sequenced in both directions to check the validity of the sequence data using the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit . the products were analyzed on a  <dig> automated dna sequencer  at the inecol’s sequencing facility, or at university of washington high throughput genomics unit, seattle, washington. finally, sequences were assembled using sequencher v <dig>   and then were manually aligned with se-al v <dig> a <dig> . all unique sequences of p. schiedeanus and those new of other psittacanthus species have been submitted to genbank .

paleodistribution modeling and environmental variation
we used species distribution modeling  to predict where populations of p. schiedeanus resided at the lgm  and last inter glacial , and whether range expansion and population connectivity are observed according to the predicted changes in the distribution of cloud forests  <cit> . coordinates of occurrence data were assembled for p. schiedeanus obtained from the global biodiversity information facility , supplemented with records from field collection . after careful verification of every data location and removing duplicate occurrence records, we restricted the data sets to unique records for the analyses, leaving  <dig> unique presence records. distributional records were input into and analyzed to infer a sdm with the maximum entropy algorithm in maxent v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and using the arcview v <dig>   to extract the gis data. present-day temperature and precipitation data  were drawn as climate layers from the worldclim database at a spatial resolution of ca. at 1 km <dig> in each raster . we first constructed a model to the present using all climatic variables with 80 % of the locality records as training data and the other 20 % as testing data in addition to response curves, jackknife tests, logistic output format and random seed parameters. variable importance was determined comparing percentage contribution values and jackknife plots. then, correlation coefficients between present variables were calculated using jmp v <dig>   with the objective to identify and remove the variables that were highly correlated  and less explanatory, having as a rule of decision, the relative contributions of each of them in the maxent model. after removing the highly correlated variables, five were used in the final analyses: temperature seasonality , min temperature of coldest month , temperature annual range , precipitation of wettest month  and precipitation seasonality . final models were constructed with  <dig> cross-validation replicates without extrapolation and considering the average output grids as the final predictive models. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  was used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models, where  <dig> is the maximum prediction and  <dig>  suggest a random prediction. resulting species distributions under current climate conditions were projected onto past climate scenarios, at the lgm  and lig . past climate layers were also drawn from the worldclim webpage for two lgm scenarios developed by the palaeoclimate modelling intercomparison project phase ii  <cit> : the community climate system model  and the model for interdisciplinary research on climate , and the lig  <cit> . the ccsm and miroc climate models simulate different climate conditions, with cooler sea-surface temperature conditions assumed in ccsm than in miroc, resulting in higher annual precipitation in ccsm than in miroc  <cit> .

measurements of temperature and precipitation  were extracted for each of the sampling locations from worldclim  <cit>  as explained above. we performed principal components analysis  using spss v <dig>  to reduce intercorrelated bio variables to a smaller system of uncorrelated, independent variables, and used the resulting pc loadings to examine habitat and ecological variation potentially related to population divergence.

phylogenetic analysis, divergence time estimation and haplotype relationships
phylogenetic relationships among sequences based on bayesian inference  were reconstructed using mrbayes v <dig>   <cit> . bi analyses were run using the cipres science gateway  <cit>  for the its, trnl-f and the concatenated data sets . jmodeltest v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was run to choose the model of molecular evolution that best fitted our sequence data under the bayesian information criterion , gtr+g, for the its, trnl-f and for the concatenated data set. two parallel markov chain monte carlo  analyses were executed simultaneously, and each was run for  <dig> million generations, sampling every  <dig> generations. bayesian posterior probability values were calculated from the sampled trees remaining after  <dig> samples were discarded as burn-in  <cit>  to only include trees after stationarity was reached. the remaining trees were used to generate a 50 % majority-rule consensus tree, showing nodes with a posterior probability  of  <dig>  or more. we consider nodes significantly supported if posterior probabilities were ≥ <dig>   <cit> . while struthanthus, cladocolea or aetanthus may be the closest relatives of psittacanthus  <cit> , relationships among phenotypically similar psittacanthus species remain uncertain  <cit> . thus, we included several congeners to root p. schiedeanus sequences. the likelihood scores under the its, trnl-f and the concatenated data sets were compared with ln bayes factors  tests to determine which tree topology significantly improved explanation of the data.

to relate genetic differentiation found among p. schiedeanus ribotypes and haplotypes to pre-pleistocene and pleistocene events, we estimated divergence time under a bayesian approach as implemented in beast v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the combined its and plastid trnl-f data set. the ingroup comprised all nrdna or plastid cpdna sequences of p. schiedeanus and sequences downloaded from genbank of species representing loranthaceae tribes from amico et al.  <cit>  and vidal-russell and nickrent  <cit>  used as multiple outgroups. divergence time estimation was performed in beast using the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock and the closest nucleotide substitution model under the bayesian information criterion , gtr+g for the concatenated data set, suggested by jmodeltest. the tree prior model was set using a coalescent approach assuming constant population size. in this analysis, we constrained nuytsiae as the sister group of members of other subtribes and psittacanthus to be monophyletic based on vidal-russell and nickrent  <cit>  and the bi tree topology.

to calibrate the root node, the divergence time between nuytsia floribunda australian root parasite and aerial loranth parasites clade  <cit>  was used as secondary calibration, approximating a median age of  <dig> mya . the geometric mean of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> substitutions per neutral site per year  was used to calibrate the tree based on the mean mutation rates of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> s/s/y for its of herbaceous annual/perennial plants  <cit>  and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> s/s/y for the trnl-f estimated for annual or perennial herbs  <cit> . for divergence time estimation, beast was run two times for  <dig> million generations, sampling every  <dig> steps. we combined log and trees files from each independent run using logcombiner v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , then viewed the combined log file in tracer v <dig>   to ensure that effective sample size  for all priors and the posterior distribution were > <dig>  making sure that parameter values were fluctuating at stable levels. based on these results, the first 10 % trees were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining trees were annotated and summarized as a maximum clade credibility tree with mean divergence times and 95 % highest posterior density  intervals of age estimates using treeannotator v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and visualized in figtree v <dig> . <dig> .

to infer genealogical relationships among ribotypes  and haplotypes , statistical parsimony networks for both data sets were constructed as implemented in tcs v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , with gaps treated as missing data and a connection limit set to 95 %. loops were resolved following the criteria given by pfenninger and posada  <cit> .

population genetic diversity indices, geographic structure and relationships among populations
population diversity for unordered  and ordered haplotypes  and differentiation  parameters were estimated using permut v <dig>   <cit> . significant differences between nst and gst parameters were tested with  <dig>  permutations. if nst is significantly larger than gst, this could indicate that the haplotypes found in a given population are phylogenetically closely related  <cit> . we also calculated haplotype diversity , nucleotide diversity  and pairwise comparisons of fst values between groups  in arlequin v <dig>   <cit>  with  <dig> permutations. populations with three samples or fewer were excluded from this analysis.

to determine whether or not populations are structured by geography or habitat distribution, three analyses of molecular variance  were performed based on pairwise differences using arlequin with populations treated as  a single group to determine the amount of variation partitioned among and within populations, and  grouped into east and west of the isthmus of tehuantepec,  three groups according to habitat distribution or  grouped into six groups according to geography and mountain range . amovas were performed using the tamura-nei model and  <dig>  permutations to determine the significance of each amova.

to estimate the relationships among groups of populations , we used its and trnl-f sequences for p. schiedeanus samples and *beast  <cit>  with the multispecies coalescent model implemented in beast. *beast models the lineage sorting process between units for groups of individuals not connected by gene flow above, at, or below the species level  <cit> . psittacanthus mayanus samples were used as outgroups. nucleotide substitution models, jc for its and f <dig> for trnl-f selected with jmodeltest were incorporated as the hasegawa-kishino-yano  model for both markers. species were assigned based on the identification of each sample using haplotype or ribotype distribution and locality. the simulation was first run with all samples as two lineages separated by the isthmus of tehuantepec , then with samples as six lineages corresponding to geography and mountain ranges  or three separate lineages according to habitat . we ran each beast analysis two times for  <dig> million generations, sampling every  <dig> steps, using a yule speciation tree prior, relaxed clock model with an uncorrelated lognormal distribution, and the mean mutation rates of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> s/s/y for its  <cit>  and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> s/s/y for the trnl-f  <cit> . after the analysis in beast, log and tree files were combined using logcombiner and summarized as a maximum clade credibility tree using treeannotator with a burn-in of 25 %. we used tracer to visualize the results of the runs and to check the ess  of each parameter.

demographic history
the demographic history of each p. schiedeanus resulting group was determined by means of neutrality tests and mismatch distributions carried out in arlequin. to test whether populations evolve under neutrality, fu’s fs test  <cit>  and tajima’s d  <cit>  were calculated, and mismatch distributions  <cit>  were calculated using the sudden expansion model of schneider and excoffier  <cit>  with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the validity of the sudden expansion assumption was determined using the sum of squares differences  and harpending’s raggedness index , both of which are higher in stable, non-expanding populations  <cit> .

bayesian skyline plots  <cit>  were also used to infer changes in effective population size  of each p. schiedeanus group  through time in beast. we chose a hky substitution model with empirical base frequencies, a strict clock model, and a piecewise-linear coalescent bayesian skyline tree prior with five starting groups. two independent runs of  <dig> million generations each were run, with trees and parameters sampled every 1000-iterations, with a burn-in of 10 %. results of each run were visualized using tracer to ensure that stationarity and convergence had been reached, and that the ess were higher than  <dig> 

we used the software ima  <cit>  on p. schiedeanus genetic groups  to estimate the effective population size of the ancestral  and the two descendant populations , effective number of migrants per generation in both directions , and time since divergence  at which the ancestral population gave rise to the descendant populations. the isolation-with-migration  model  <cit>  is appropriate to estimate parameters for two descendant populations that have diverged recently from the ancestral population and that may be sharing haplotypes as a result of gene interchange. we began with multiple runs of  <dig>  steps  to assess mixing and to fine-tune the parameter space. we then conducted the simulation for a burn-in of  <dig> million generations and  <dig> million steps, under the hky model of sequence evolution. two independent runs were performed with different seed numbers to guarantee convergence of samples  <cit> . we considered that the analyses had converged upon a stationary distribution if the independent runs had similar posterior distributions and the ess for each parameter was at least  <dig>  we report the mean parameter estimates of two runs and the 90 % highest posterior densities  intervals of each parameter. we used the geometric mean of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> of the mutation rates  for both loci . the mutation rates were converted to per locus rate by multiplying by the fragment length in base pairs for conversion to demographic units, as required by ima  <cit> . we used an 11-year generation time based on the observation that the age at maturity  begins ca. 2 years after seed germination and an assumed annual survivorship of  <dig>  based on mistletoe seedling survivorship  <cit>  to convert the effective populations size estimates. the approximate average generation time  is calculated according to t = a +   <cit> , where a is the time to maturity and s is the adult annual survival rate. based on this, estimate for t was 11 years. to convert the ima time since divergence parameter to years, t, we divided the time parameter  by the mutation rate per year  converted to per locus rate by multiplying by the fragment length in base pairs, and calculated for the mean rate described above.

evolutionary transition of mistletoe invasion
the evolutionary transition of mistletoe invasion was inferred from an approximate bayesian computation in which evolutionary scenarios were simulated and compared through posterior probabilities  <cit>  using the diyabc software  <cit> . populations covering the whole species’ distribution were analyzed to infer the history of the genetic structure indicated by phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of its and trnl-f sequences. because three haplotype clusters are hypothesized to be associated with individuals/populations separated by habitat  with post-glacial population expansions and potentially corresponding to post-glacial invasion types , five evolutionary scenarios were built and tested considering haplotype network and *beast analyses:  three populations  have diverged simultaneously from an ancestral population at t <dig> , which corresponded to the plant genetic groups, bree, schi and caly, respectively;  isolation split model  <dig> , in which pop <dig>  merged with pop <dig>  at t <dig> and subsequently with pop <dig>  at t2;  isolation split model  <dig> , in which pop <dig> merged with pop <dig> at t <dig>  then both populations merged with pop <dig> at t2;  isolation split model  <dig> , in which pop <dig> merged with pop <dig> at t <dig> and then both populations merged with pop <dig> at t2; and  isolation with admixture model , in which pop <dig> was generated by admixture of pops  <dig> and  <dig> at t <dig>  then pop <dig> merged with pop <dig> at t <dig>  although there are numerous possible scenarios of divergence, we considered that these five scenarios represent the close relationships among the groups and the complex patterns of genetic divergence and admixture .

we generated  <dig> million simulated datasets per scenario considering a generalized stepwise-mutation model, uniform prior distributions for effective population sizes  and splitting events . comparison of scenarios was implemented in the diyabc software  <cit> . the posterior probability of scenarios was assessed using a weighted polychotomous logistic regression on the 1 % of simulated datasets closest to the observed data  <cit> . for the best-supported scenario, we performed a model checking procedure by applying a pca on test statistic vectors to visualize the fit between the simulated and the observed datasets. to assess the confidence in scenario choice, we simulated  <dig> pseudo-observed datasets  under each scenario to estimate type i and type ii error rates  <cit> . finally, point estimates for demographic and temporal parameters were obtained by local linear regression on the 1 % of simulations closest to the observed data set for the best-supported scenario  <cit> .

RESULTS
paleodistribution modeling and environmental variation
the sdm yielded a good fit for the current geographic distribution of p. schiedeanus. the auc value for the replicate runs was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . although there was some over prediction in certain geographic areas , the modeled distribution closely matches the current known distribution of p. schiedeanus. the paleodistribution modeling revealed that suitable habitat for p. schiedeanus during the lig was more fragmented and restricted to mountain areas along the pacific slope . however, the predictions for the lgm revealed that conditions of suitable habitat potentially expanded the distribution of p. schiedeanus, particularly in the eastern side of the sierra madre oriental, oaxaca and chiapas applying both ccsm and miroc simulations , and with a low probability into the yucatan peninsula under the ccsm scenario . overall, the comparison between present and past climatic conditions predicted by the models suggests that climatic conditions of suitable habitat for p. schiedeanus experienced range shifts from the pacific slope to east, expansion from lig to lgm and contraction from lgm to present .fig.  <dig> results from the maxent analyses showing species distribution models for psittacanthus schiedeanus  last inter glacial ,  last glacial maximum ,  last glacial maximum , and  at present. the output of maxent consists of grid maps with each cell having an index of suitability between  <dig> and  <dig>  low values  indicate that the conditions are unsuitable for the species to occur, whereas high values  indicate that the conditions are suitable. there is clear evidence that populations are connected during glacial cycles. note that for maps b and c projections extend out into the ocean because of changes in sea levels



the pca of environmental data indicated two niche axes that together explained  <dig>  % of the variation in p. schiedeanus . the first niche axis  was associated with precipitation variables , and mean temperature diurnal range , isothermality , temperature seasonality  and temperature annual range . the second niche axis  was associated with temperature variables .fig.  <dig> principal components analysis  on the  <dig> bioclim variables with the first principal component  largely a measure of precipitation conditions, and the second principal component  mainly determined by temperature measures. numbers refer to collection sites  and pie charts represent trnl-f haplotypes found in each sampling locality 



phylogenetic analysis, divergence time estimation and haplotype relationships
the aligned sequences of its region  and the trnl-f intergenic spacer  for psittacanthus species were  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs  long, respectively. out of 1018 bp of the concatenated sequences,  <dig> sites were variable and out of these  <dig> were parsimony informative. in p. schiedeanus samples, we detected polymorphic sites in nine samples of the its region, with four of the  <dig> aligned sites . these were coded as ambiguous.

the trees obtained from the bayesian analyses of the individual molecular markers  and the combined data set all differ in topology and degree of resolution. the trnl-f gene produced the poorest resolved tree  and also contains the smallest number of nodes with posterior probability  values above  <dig> . the combined its and trnl-f data set produced the most resolved tree and contains the highest number of nodes with pp values above  <dig> . the topology of the resulting bi tree showed monophyly of psittacanthus samples , with an early divergence of a clade composed of p. ramiflorus, p. sonorae and p. palmeri, followed by a clade with moderate support containing samples of p. rhynchanthus  and a clade with moderate support  containing samples of the brazilian species  and samples of p. macrantherus, p. mayanus, p. auriculatus, p. calyculatus and p. schiedeanus. samples of p. calyculatus and samples of p. schiedeanus from the eastern mexico cloud forests, central oaxaca and chiapas turned out to be monophyletic, but little support  and genetic structure was observed within this clade. the bayes factor tests showed extensive incongruence between the chloroplast and the nuclear partitions. combining its and trnl-f data sets produced a higher likelihood score than those for the alternative its or trnl-f data sets .

discussion
mistletoes in the mesoamerican cloud forests
in northern mesoamerica, cloud forests encompass an extremely heterogeneous mixture of north american temperate tree species that are present in the region since the tertiary and tropical species with south american origins during the early miocene . the dynamic mesoamerican geological landscape from the miocene to the pliocene and the repeated cycles of cloud forest contraction and expansion due to pleistocene climatic conditions  <cit>  affected the distribution and composition of cloud forests in the region, and contributed to both ancient  <cit>  and more recent divergences producing a common phylogeographic break at the isthmus of tehuantepec . the emerging phylogeographical patterns of temperate tree species that have migrated south from north america have been attributed to isolation by arid conditions during the pliocene and climate changes during pleistocene glaciations that promoted the expansion, contraction and divergence of populations  <cit> . however, plant species that presumably colonized northern mesoamerica from south america are little studied.

seven studies have explored the phylogeography of widespread, cloud forest-adapted plant species across northern mesoamerica. high levels of genetic variation and geographical structuring were inferred for wind-dispersed alsophila firma  d.s. conant   <cit>  and liquidambar styraciflua l.   <cit>  or bird-dispersed podocarpus matudae lundell , palicourea padifolia  c.m. taylor & lorence  and rhipsalis baccifera  stearn   <cit> . on the other hand, for wind/gravity dispersed begonia heracleifolia cham. & schltdl.   <cit>  and moussonia deppeana  hanst.   <cit> , the genetic variation and genetic structure were inferred to be stronger. the high genetic differentiation of populations with strong spatial structuring provides support for the persistence of populations in situ during dry periods in the pleistocene, in which populations remained isolated within the current fragmented distribution of the cloud forest  <cit> , suggesting that the vegetation along the isthmus of tehuantepec has acted as a barrier to seed dispersal and that the multiple vicariance events observed in various taxa occurred at earlier different times  <cit> . however, the widely documented genetic break at the isthmus of tehuantepec in several taxa  <cit> , though significant for the plastid trnl-f data, only explained 28 % of the total variation according to the amova model, suggesting that low levels of seed flow have occurred across this barrier.

we found population genetic structure in p. schiedeanus, with differentiation between groups of populations separated by habitat type. despite the genetic differentiation of some p. schiedeanus populations, there are widespread ribotypes and haplotypes in the its and trnl-f markers, respectively. in particular, the lower variation found in its and the presence of widespread ribotypes in the region are suggestive of effective nuclear gene flow via pollen . in contrast, the population differentiation of p. schiedeanus shown by the plastid trnl-f data suggests that seed flow has been more restricted in some cases. our results from the pairwise fst comparisons and amova analysis suggest fairly high levels of genetic diversity among populations and habitat types of p. schiedeanus, especially when considering the cpdna. however, significant evidence of population expansions was found in cpdna sequences and the most frequent haplotypes were retrieved in most cloud forest areas of p. schiedeanus. bsps, negative values of tajima’s d, fu’s fs and the results of mismatch distribution for the plastid marker suggest that the population in the cloud forests  has experienced recent demographic expansion, most likely during the lgm.

predictions of sdms under past lgm climatic conditions and the significant signal of demographic expansion suggest that p. schiedeanus  populations experienced a range expansion tracking the conditions of the cloud forest distribution and shifted to the lowlands with population connectivity during the lgm, as predicted by the moist forests model  <cit> . in addition, the bayesian skyline plot for the schi population detected a significant increase in the overall effective population size dating to sometime during the lgm, when sudden demographic expansion occurred and descent to lower elevations allowed populations to gene flow. however, patterns of high genetic diversity among different populations do not fully support this hypothesis. the distribution of haplotype diversity suggests that the low genetic structure observed among populations of cloud forest areas is due to population connectivity across low-elevation barriers. accordingly, we would hypothesize that during glacial periods, populations of p. schiedeanus expanded to the lowlands, gene flow was extensive, and habitats in which populations had gone extinct during the interglacials were probably re-colonized. throughout interglacial periods, populations fragmented and contracted as they moved up in elevation with the warming climate and genetic divergence commenced across cloud forest areas dissected by mountains and low-elevation barriers.

despite the appeal of the contraction/expansion model of populations of cloud forest-adapted species throughout glacial-interglacial climate cycles by shifting elevation, there is little evidence for a common demographic pattern of co-distributed species  <cit> . ruiz-sanchez and ornelas  <cit>  analyzed the phylogeographical structure of liquidambar styraciflua , a deciduous tree commonly parasitized by p. schiedeanus with a disjunct distribution between the deciduous forest of the southeastern usa and the mesoamerican cloud forest, and found signals of demographic expansion of mesoamerican populations and habitat suitability connected and expanded to lower coastal areas under lgm climatic conditions. however, these patterns of genetic structure are not shared by p. schiedeanus. the observed inconsistency between demographic histories of p. schiedeanus and its most frequent host tree species in cloud forests can be the result of a differential response of species to climate change.

the role of historical climate changes on mistletoe evolution
the phylogeographical structure found in p. schiedeanus suggests that three lineages occupy geographic regions separated by habitat type, driving isolation and genetic divergence between groups of populations enhanced by environmental differences. despite the high levels of genetic diversity and genetic structure of cpdna among groups of populations , the occurrence of widespread plastid haplotypes in most areas  of the range of p. schiedeanus is consistent with the hypothesis of effective seed dispersal episodes. accordingly, the mobility of bird dispersal agents has erased the genetic structure predicted to groups of populations along the cloud forest distribution , grey silky-flycatchers , and social flycatchers   <cit> . the foraging and flocking behavior and local abundance bird dispersers differ widely  <cit> , and, consequently, affect differently the spatial patterns of mistletoe seed deposition  <cit> . on their winter migration cedar waxwings usually arrive in groups of 15– <dig> individuals on a single infected tree, whereas grey silky-flycatchers and social flycatchers occur in pairs or small flocks of 3– <dig> individuals. the winter migration route of cedar waxwings overlaps the distribution of p. schiedeanus, and the timing of its arrival coincides with the mistletoe fruiting season  <cit> . bird migration could produce a large-scale seed rain pattern in a north to south direction, and this current directional gene flow could have erased past phylogeographic patterns.

because cedar waxwings and grey silky-flycatchers tend to perch on mistletoe infected trees, their residence time on the most abundant host species ranges from  <dig> to 30 min  <cit>  and defecate p. schiedeanus seeds within a short time of ingestion , it is also possible that the dispersal of p. schiedeanus may be geographically limited, leading to its local adaptation restricted to available host trees along cloud forests. cedar waxwings defecate more mistletoe seeds onto branches of l. styraciflua individuals than onto those of other tree species  <cit> , and more seedlings survive on branches of the most frequently infected host species, l. styraciflua  <cit> . in contrast with other host tree species, the higher germination rates of bird gut-processed mistletoes collected on liquidambar trees is consistent with the prevalence and spatial distribution patterns reported by previous studies  <cit> , and cross-infection experiments have shown the potential for local host adaptation in p. schiedeanus  <cit> . in this way, depending on the heterogeneity of host patches at a local scale, some mistletoe plants can develop more specificity on particular host trees that may lead to gene flow changes and the eventual formation of mistletoe races  <cit> . however, the large host range suggests that p. schiedeanus is not host-specific, and in areas where liquidambar is absent the parasite-host interaction is predominantly with other host species. thus, geologic and climate-driven processes implicated in the fragmentation of the mesoamerican cloud forests and, consequently the distribution of potential host species at a larger geographical scale, as well as selection pressures imposed by floral visitors and seed dispersers, could have influenced the distribution of the genetic variation among populations of p. schiedeanus. if the historical fragmentation of cloud forest patches or selection reduced gene flow among p. schiedeanus populations, host specificity may lead to genetic divergence and ultimately allopatric speciation.

however, the abc analyses strongly supported the scenario of simultaneous divergence among the three groups dating back ca. 200 k years ago. this divergence time estimate for the groups of populations could have resulted from the low power of abc analyses and our set of nuclear and chloroplast dna sequences to detect subtle genetic differences in divergence times among groups of populations that have been isolated more recently. under this scenario, climatic fluctuations throughout the pleistocene would have altered the distribution of suitable habitat for mistletoes throughout mesoamerica leading to variation in population continuity and isolation. species that occur in topographically complex regions will frequently move between high and low elevation habitats in response to climatic fluctuations during glacial cycles  <cit> . furthermore, the plant density and the clumped spatial distribution of conspecifics may affect hummingbird foraging behavior. hummingbirds may forage more locally in search of nectar in high-density populations of p. schiedeanus, thereby reducing the dispersal distances of pollen. therefore, pollen dispersal distance is expected to be lower in a high-density species distributed in a naturally fragmented habitat where individuals are locally aggregated on cloud forest host trees. however, its wide host and geographical ranges and large-scale seed recruitment patterns produced by long-distance bird migrants that consume and eventually disperse mistletoe seeds might have lead to increased gene flow, thus obscuring the geographical genetic structure created by cloud forest isolation before and during the pleistocene.

CONCLUSIONS
our phylogeographic approach allowed us to clarify relationships among populations of p. schiedeanus mainly distributed among cloud forests  and the distribution boundaries with phenotypically similar psittacanthus populations allopatrically distributed in more xeric environments . genetic differentiation among these groups was strong and significant for the plastid trnl-f marker and non-significant for the nuclear its. collectively, our data suggest that geographical, ecological, historical and environmental factors are the main drivers of genetic differentiation of these mesoamerican parrot-flower mistletoes. according to sdms, population expansion tests, skyline plots and divergence time estimations, the invasion of p. schiedeanus to cloud forests in eastern mexico is relatively recent, and the invasion occurred to host tree species with longer histories in the region . nonetheless, to better understand and manage threats of mistletoe populations, including potential transmission pathways of these commercially and ecologically important pathogens  <cit>  and genetic dilution from hybridization between p. schiedeanus and other sympatric psittacanthus species, a more detailed sampling within the distribution of closely related p. calyculatus and p. breedlovei along the trans-mexican volcanic belt and tropical dry forests in the central depression of chiapas is needed. also, the genotyping of individuals using specifically designed microsatellites  <cit>  will be critically important to the understanding of psittacanthus species boundaries.
