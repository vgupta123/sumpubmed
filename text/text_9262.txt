BACKGROUND
a biological system consists of a large number of proteins involved in a series of intricate and tightly orchestrated interactions. representing this complex system as a network allows us to harness network-mining methodologies to analyse the system as a whole. diseases typically affect only a small number of proteins  <cit> . the immediate interacting partners of these proteins can be expected to show a change in expression levels or behavior. in addition, the inter-connected nature of the system causes cascade effects, altering the levels of proteins far removed from the original source. at the same time, the system may attempt to restore its equilibrium by launching a stress-response  <cit> . it would be interesting and useful to identify the key players in this tug-of-war, which are most influential in either spreading or curtailing the perturbation. these key proteins are referred to as epicenters specific to that condition.

a vast amount of data is generated by microarray experiments, which provide a snapshot of the active and inactive players of the system. these datasets are available on public databases such as omnibus  <cit> . most studies in biology focus on only a few proteins or pathways, and work with a restricted field of view. through algorithms such as epitracer, we hope to enable the analysis of large scale and detailed models, giving a picture which reflects the intricate workings of living systems more closely. in this paper, we work with a dataset consisting of nearly half the complement of human genes.

in this paper, we develop an algorithm called epitracer, which identifies the epicenters from which either the perturbation or the reaction to it ripples out. this is done using a protein-protein interaction  network into which gene expression levels before and after the perturbation are integrated. to the best of our knowledge, no method exists currently which can identify epicenters with this type of data. other methods that provide insights into influential nodes require a causal network as input, where each edge depicts a causal relationship, and is directed from the cause to the effect  <cit> . however, clear-cut causal dependencies have been established for only a small set of proteins, making it impossible to analyse large networks. network motifs have also been used to highlight important proteins in directed biological networks  <cit> . however these methods do not make use of information about changes in expression levels of genes, thus losing out on a rich source of information. methods also exist which highlight the nodes which, when intentionally perturbed, spread the perturbation the fastest  <cit> . this is not the same as identifying the epicenter of a naturally occurring perturbation, which is a more complicated and biologically relevant scenario.

the epitracer algorithm is based on the observation that an epicentric protein would have to be highly active in order to exert its influence, and also have good connectivity in order for its influence to spread. we define a new centrality measure called ripple centrality, which gives a combined measure of a node ′s activity as well as its connectivity, thus allowing us to rank proteins on their ability to be an effective epicenter. the top-ranked proteins qualify to be epicenters. the algorithm combines the ppi network and gene expression levels in such a way as to ease the computation of active paths. the sub-network with high activity paths only in the perturbed condition is extracted, thus reducing the search space for the next step. the nodes in this sub-network are then ranked on the basis of their ripple centrality score, with the top  <dig> nodes considered as epicenters. the efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated through two case studies. the first case study analyses human glioma cell line  upon overexpression of the gene park <dig>   <cit> . the algorithm was able to identify park <dig> as the most important epicenter without any prior knowledge of the perturbation. functional enrichment analysis showed that most of the top  <dig> epicenters play a role in enabling or countering the activity of park <dig>  also,  <dig> of the top  <dig> epicenters showed no significant fold change, proving that our method is capable of identifying more than simple differential expression analysis. the epitracer pipeline includes a program for extracting the immediate influence zone of the epicenters. analysis of the immediate influence zone of the top-ranked epicenter  showed that it was enriched in genes involved in cell-cycle regulation. the second case study attempts to identify the target genes regulated by transcription factor sp <dig> by knocking down the expression of sp <dig> in hela cells   <cit> . in this study, epitracer was able to identify sp <dig> among the top ranked epicenters. sensitivity analysis was carried out by increasing the gene expression levels of all nodes by upto  <dig> % , and decreasing the gene expression levels of all nodes by upto  <dig> % . it was found that irrespective of the direction or extent of perturbation,  <dig> nodes always appear in the top  <dig> ranks, and  <dig> nodes always appear in the top  <dig> ranks of epicenters. this shows that the nodes ranked as epicenters remain largely unaffected even when every gene in the system is subjected to a minor change.

methods
a high-density protein-protein interaction network was reconstructed for use in this work. condition-specific gene expression profiles were obtained from published literature. the inputs as well as the algorithm are explained below.

protein-protein interaction network
a base network containing known and predicted protein-protein interactions, genetic interactions and regulatory interactions with directions was taken from khurana et. al.,  <dig>  <cit> . metabolic interactions from kegg  <cit>  were added to this, resulting in a directed network with  <dig>  nodes and  <dig>  edges.

gene expression profiles
two gene expression datasets were obtained from the geo database  <cit> . in the first dataset gse <dig>  <cit> , park <dig> gene was overexpressed in human glioma cell line . in the second study gse <dig>  <cit> , sp <dig> gene was knocked down using sirna in hela cells. these two case studies were selected to demonstrate the general applicability of the epitracer algorithm. genespringx  <dig> . <dig>  with robust multichip averaging   <cit>  was used for microarray data normalization. a  <dig>  fold cut-off was applied for differential gene expression analysis .

combining the inputs
the gene expression profile of each condition was mapped onto the ppi network, to create one weighted network per condition ). the nodes  were given a weight equal to the normalized signal intensity for the corresponding gene in that condition. wix=six where wix is the weight of node i in condition x, and six is the normalized signal intensity in condition x. this formulation stems from the assumption that the expression level of a gene gives a reasonably good approximation of the abundance of the protein in the system. the cost of an edge  was taken as a function of the abundance of the participating proteins, as 
 cix=1wux∗wvx  where cix is the cost of edge i in condition x, and wux, wvx are the weights of the nodes comprising the edge. this follows from the assumption used in mass-action kinetics, that the activity of a reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the participants. taking the inverse makes sure that a highly active interaction has a very low edge cost.
fig.  <dig> the epitracer workflow. a gene expression profiles of each condition are mapped onto the base ppi network. b highest activity paths are calculated for each condition, and common paths are discarded, giving condition-specific highest activity paths . c the network induced by the cshaps form the condition-specific highest activity networks . d nodes in the perturbed highest activity network are ranked according to ripple centrality. e the ranked list of nodes is split into two lists based on overlaps with the control highest activity network. top  <dig> nodes in the list unique to the perturbed condition form the epicenters specific to the perturbation



given a path with n edges, the sum of costs of the edges involved in the path gives the cost of the path. 
 pathcost=∑i=1ncix  where cix is the edge cost for each edge in the path, and n is the length of the path. a shortest path algorithm will preferentially choose edges with the least cost for a given source and destination, which in our formulation translates to identifying the highest activity path.

epitracer algorithm – rationale
in order to be effective, an epicenter should be highly active and participate in high activity paths only in the perturbed condition. to capture this, we calculate highest activity paths in each condition and discard common paths. the common paths correspond to the paths which remain highly active and unchanged irrespective of the perturbation. such paths add no information about the perturbation ). the edges involved in these cshaps induce a sub-network of the original network, referred to as the condition-specific highest activity networks  ).

an epicenter should also be able to reach many nodes in the network in order to exert its influence, and the paths from the epicenter to these nodes must also be highly active. this is captured by the new centrality measure proposed here termed ripple centrality, and is explained below.

closeness centrality
closeness centrality  <cit>  of a node u is defined as the reciprocal of the sum of shortest path costs from u to every reachable node v c=1∑vσ  where σ is the cost of the shortest path from u to v. because of the way edge costs are formulated, a node u with highly active paths to a set of nodes v will have high closeness centrality. this is depicted by node acl in fig. 2a. here a thicker edge corresponds to a highly active reaction.
fig.  <dig> illustration of ripple centrality. a node acl is the source of highly active paths, and has high closeness centrality. however it can only reach  <dig> nodes, and is not a good epicenter. b node aor can reach  <dig> nodes, but paths originating at aor have low activity. thus it is not a good epicenter. c node arc is the source of highly active paths and can reach a large number of nodes , making it the best candidate for an epicenter. the hexagon represents candidate epicenters



outward reachability
given a node u, the number of nodes reachable from u is termed its outward reachability  <cit> . 
 rout=nodesreachablefromu  where rout denotes outward reachability of u.

ripple centrality
in fig. 2a, the node acl represents nodes which have very high activity paths, but to only a small number of nodes. such a node would have high closeness centrality  <cit> , but would not be a good candidate for an epicenter as any perturbation arising at this point could not spread to a large number of nodes. on the other hand, node aor  represents nodes which have very good connectivity, but participate in relatively low activity paths. these types of nodes would have high outward reachability, but are poor candidates for epicenters. thus neither closeness centrality nor outward reachability are sufficient on their own. node arc in fig. 2c has highly active paths to a large number of nodes, and is the best candidate for an epicenter.

we formulate a new measure, ripple centrality, which serves as a logical and between closeness centrality and outward reachability. 
 ripplecentrality=c∗rout 

in the calculation, both closeness centrality and outward reachability are normalized. ripple centrality is calculated for the nodes in the perturbed cshan, resulting in the proteins being ranked on the basis of their effectiveness as potential epicenters ). the ranked list is then split into two lists –  nodes occurring only in the perturbed cshan, and  nodes common to both cshans ). common nodes work as global epicenters, playing key roles both before and after the perturbation. since identical paths have already been discarded ), these proteins are those which have undergone re-wiring, and participate in a different pathway upon perturbation. the nodes occurring only in the perturbed cshan are epicenters specific to the perturbation, involved in either the spread of the perturbation or the reaction to it.

epitracer algorithm
the epitracer algorithm consists of three modules  highest_activity_paths extracts the paths with cost inside a user-defined percentile threshold,  condition_specific_han uses highest_activity_paths to identify the highest activity network specific to each condition, and  the main module, get_epicenters, uses the above two modules to identify the top  <dig> epicenters in the perturbed condition, as well as the top  <dig> epicenters common to both conditions. the pseudocode for each module is provided in algorithms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the symbols ga and gb refer to the graph for condition a and the graph for condition b, respectively.







biological analysis
the proteins identified as epicenters, as well as the proteins surrounding them were subjected to biological and functional analysis.

immediate influence zone
the nodes that occur within two hops upstream or downstream from an epicenter are designated the immediate influence zone of that epicenter. for the top-ranked epicenter, the immediate influence zone was identified manually and was restricted to the perturbed highest activity network. downregulated genes which occur within two hops of the epicenter were picked from the full network and added to the influence zone.

since manually examining the full network for dysregulated genes in the vicinity of every epicenter is a time consuming and laborious task, an automated script was developed to facilitate the quick extraction of the influence zone. this can be done on the full network or on the highest activity network. this allows for easy identification of nodes with significant dysregulation, and can be used for further analysis. this script uses a default fold change cut-off of  <dig> . both the number of hops and the fold change can be varied by the user if necessary.

functional enrichment
gene set enrichment was performed against the kegg  <cit>  database using webgestalt  <cit> . a hypergeometric test with p-value of  <dig>  with fdr correction was used for statistical analysis. network visualization was carried out with cytoscape, and the cytoscape plugin cluego  <cit>  was used for go module enrichment.

sensitivity analysis
two separate sensitivity analyses were carried out, one by increasing the expression levels of all genes by a randomly chosen value between  <dig> and  <dig> %, and the other by decreasing the expression levels of all genes similarly. this reflects measurement errors that can be introduced in the microarray data due to variability in the sensitivity of the detector. all numbers reported are an average of  <dig> independent experiments.

RESULTS
the algorithm was implemented in python  <dig> , and uses the functions provided by networkx  <dig>  for computing all the centrality measures. dijkstra ′s algorithm  <cit>  was used for finding shortest paths. the epitracer algorithm was able to analyse a dataset consisting of  <dig>  nodes and  <dig>  edges on a  <dig> core xeon server in less than  <dig> minutes.

the results of the first case study are provided in detail in the next section, followed by a summary of the second case study.

case study 1
microarray data for the overexpression of park <dig> in human glioma cell line  and control  were taken from   <cit> . park <dig>  is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase whose dysfunction has been associated with parkinsonism. the authors of this data, in their study  <cit> , show that park <dig> is frequently deleted or downregulated in human glioma, and demonstrate that overexpression of park <dig> can significantly inhibit glioma cell growth. through the epitracer algorithm, we uncover the global reprogramming of gene expression resulting from this perturbation, and highlight the epicenters of this process. we also provide a ranked list of influential players in this perturbation.

system description
the gene expression profiles were normalized and filtered, and the list of differentially expressed genes was extracted using a fold change cut-off of  <dig> . it was found that  <dig> genes were downregulated and  <dig>  genes were upregulated as a result of the overexpression of park <dig>  in general, genes associated with cell cycle, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, erbb signaling pathway, mapk, jak-stat signaling, wnt signaling, hedgehog signaling pathway and pathways related to lipid metabolism were differentially expressed. a summary of network properties is shown in fig. 3a.

highest activity paths 
all-pairs-shortest paths were calculated for the control network as well as the perturbed network. paths with length ≥  <dig> were sorted in the ascending order of path cost. it was found that the number of paths retained at a percentile cut-off of  <dig>  was twice that retained when a cut-off of  <dig>  was used. thus the conservative threshold of  <dig>  percentile was chosen, resulting in  <dig>  paths being retained as highest activity paths  in the perturbed network and  <dig>  haps in the control network.

condition-specific highest activity network 
highest activity paths common to both conditions correspond to the paths which are highly active all the time, and are unaffected by the perturbation. such paths were removed, giving us  <dig>  haps specific to the control condition, and  <dig>  haps specific to the perturbed condition. the edges involved in these paths correspond to the condition-specific highest activity networks . interestingly, the cshans were themselves well-connected networks .

of the  <dig>  genes in the perturbed cshan,  <dig> genes were found to be downregulated, and  <dig> were found to be upregulated. these belonged to the functional categories of cell cycle, mapk, erbb, p <dig> and mtor signaling pathway, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and oocyte meiosis.

tracing the epicenter
the nodes in the perturbed cshan were ranked in descending order of their ripple centrality. this ranked list was then split into two - nodes occurring only in the perturbed cshan, and nodes common to both cshans . since common paths have already been removed, nodes common to both cshans correspond to the nodes which participate in a different pathway after the perturbation. nodes occurring only in the perturbed cshan are those which have become active and influential after the perturbation.

the top  <dig> nodes from each list were considered as epicenters, and are listed in fig. 3d. park <dig> was identified as the highest ranked epicenter among the nodes unique to the perturbed cshan, in spite of the fact that the algorithm was given no prior knowledge of the perturbation. only  <dig> out of the  <dig> epicenters specific to the perturbed condition were found to have significant differential expression. this shows that epitracer is able to capture information that simple differential expression analysis cannot. the  <dig> epicenters which were differentially expressed, along with their immediate neighbors, have been depicted in fig. 3c.

biological interpretation
top global epicenters were found to correspond to highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed proteins such as tubb, gapdh, vcl, actg <dig>  dynll <dig> and anxa <dig>  rac <dig> is known to promote cell migration and invasion in glioma cells. app is associated with axonogenesis, neurite growth and neuronal adhesion  <cit> . prdx <dig> is involved in redox regulation of the cell. b2m is associated with mhc class i antigen presentation.

further, the top epicenters specific to the perturbed  condition were examined. it was found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes being examined showed significant differential expression, namely park <dig>  rgs <dig>  epha <dig>  dnajc <dig> and fgf <dig> . park <dig> was highlighted as the most important epicenter specific to the park <dig> overexpression condition. park <dig> negatively regulates cell cycle by degrading cyclin e and d through its activity as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase. rgs <dig> is involved in g <dig> to g <dig> transition  <cit> . inhibition of epha <dig> leads to stalling of cells in g0/g <dig> phase  <cit> . in the park <dig> overexpression condition, epha <dig> was found to be upregulated. fgf <dig> blocks cell proliferation and causes a g2/m arrest  <cit> . when considered together, our analysis revealed that most of the top ranked genes were associated with cell cycle regulation.

immediate influence zone of the top-ranked epicenter
in order to understand the cellular response to the top-ranked epicenter specific to the perturbed condition , the influence zone around it was analysed. the subgraph induced by considering nodes upto two hops up/downstream of park <dig> in the perturbed cshan were considered to be in the park <dig> influence zone. any downregulated nodes within  <dig> hops of park <dig> in the complete network were also added . go enrichment was carried out specifically for cell cycle regulation as park <dig> is known to be a cell cycle regulator. interestingly, it was found that the park <dig> influence zone was highly enriched for cell cycle regulation , including g2/m transition and g1/s transition of mitotic cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle, positive and negative regulation of cell cycle.
fig.  <dig> park <dig> influence zone. detailed biological interpretation of park <dig> influence zone. a the park <dig> influence zone consists of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. red colored nodes correspond to upregulated genes, and green corresponds to downregulated genes. the epicenter is depicted using a hexagon. b go enrichement of genes in park <dig> influence zone shows that most genes are involved in cell-cycle regulation. c nodes downstream of park <dig> d mechanistic insights into cell-cycle dysregulation upon park <dig> overexpression



the influence exerted by park <dig> was studied by focusing on the nodes downstream of park <dig> . it was found that many downstream genes such as mdm <dig>  chek <dig>  sqstm <dig> and dusp <dig> were involved in cell cycle regulation.

since overexpression of park <dig> inhibits the progression of cell cycle, the expected response from the cell would be to modify other regulatory mechanisms of cell cycle progression to counteract this arrest. examination of the nodes downstream of the top-ranked epicenter  showed that this was indeed the case . major remodeling can be inferred from the g0/g <dig> and g1/s transition. sqstm <dig>  is involved in exiting of the cell from the m phase in the cell cycle. cd <dig>  epha <dig>  rgs <dig> and arl6ip <dig> are positive regulators for g0/g <dig> transition. mdm <dig> is an activator of g1/s transition as it inhibits p <dig> and rb proteins. however, chek <dig> and dusp <dig> are repressors of g1/s phase transition. chek <dig> acts as a cyclin e repressor by inhibiting cdc at the dna-repair check-point. dusp <dig> is a repressor of the mapk pathway  <cit> . fgf <dig> and nek <dig> are repressors of g2/m phase transition  <cit> .

since creation of such influence zones for every highly ranked gene is a tedious task, an automated script was developed to output the influence zone as well as to summarize the details of differentially expressed genes in an easy-to-read table. the table thus generated for the second highest ranked epicenter, cd <dig>  is shown in table  <dig> 


sensitivity analysis
the gene expression levels of all the genes were either increased or decreased as indicated in the methods section. the results of the  <dig> independent runs were then analysed to check how the top ranked epicenters fared. it was found that  <dig> nodes were always present in the top  <dig> ranked epicenters specific to the perturbed condition irrespective of the direction or extent of perturbation. when the top  <dig> ranks were considered,  <dig> nodes were common to all  <dig> experiments. also, park <dig> was ranked the  <dig> th most important epicenter specific to the perturbed condition on average out of  <dig>  possible candidates. this shows that even when every single node in the network was perturbed, the nodes ranked as epicenters remained largely unaffected.

case study 2
microarray data for the knockdown of sp <dig> gene in hela cells were taken from gse <dig>  <cit> . the knockdown was carried out by treating hela cells with an sirna directed against the sp <dig> mrna. sp <dig> is a global transcription factor, and regulates various important biological processes such as proliferation, cell differentiation and oncogenesis. since the knockdown of a transcription factor can lead to downregulation of its target genes which are positively regulated, these genes will have higher activity in the control condition. hence in this scenario, we analyse epicenters specific to the perturbed as well as the control condition.

biological interpretation
in the perturbed  condition, the top  <dig> ranked epicenters consist of  <dig> genes.  <dig> genes are assigned the same rank due to similar activity and connectivity. out of the  <dig> epicenters,  <dig> genes, namely gprc5a, ebf <dig>  ptpn <dig>  fas and adck <dig> were differentially expressed. gprc5a, ebf <dig> and ptpn <dig> genes play important roles in development, cellular growth, and differentiation  <cit> . fas is involved in physiological regulation of programmed cell death. the function of adck <dig> is not yet clear. in the control condition, top  <dig> epicenters include  <dig> genes, with  <dig> genes being ranked 7th and  <dig> genes being ranked  <dig> nd due to similar activity. in this case, sp <dig> appeared as the 10th ranked epicenter.

immediate influence zone
the immediate influence zone of the top  <dig> epicenters was constructed as a combined network. the targets of sp <dig> and their first interactors were added to this network, and the entire network was pruned to retain only epicenters, targets of sp <dig>  differentially expressed genes, and genes which were essential for the connectivity of the graph. this pruned graph contains  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, and is shown in fig. 5a. analysis of the graph showed that epicenters were generally indirect regulators of the targets of sp <dig>  this could indicate that alternative methods of regulating sp <dig> targets gained importance due to the knockdown of sp <dig>  many targets of sp <dig> were found in the highest activity paths which trace back to the epicenters. for example, myc and tp <dig> were highlighted as important genes regulated by sp <dig>  and  <dig> regulators of myc were ranked as epicenters, with  <dig> of them being assigned the same rank due to similar activity. the paths tracing back to the epicenters clearly illustrate the cascade of influence of the epicenters to the targets of sp <dig>  involving mediator genes. the most prominent mediator genes in the sp <dig> knockdown condition are eef1a <dig> and hspa <dig>  eef1a <dig> is regulated by  <dig> epicenters, of which fas, ebf <dig> and ptpn <dig> are differentially expressed. eef1a <dig> in turn regulates  <dig> targets of sp <dig>  of which ep <dig> is differentially expressed. ep <dig> is a transcriptional co-activator protein, and is important in the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation.
fig.  <dig> case study  <dig> . influence zone of the top  <dig> epicenters was constructed from the condition-specific highest activity network and enriched with the targets of sp <dig> and their immediate neighbors. this network was pruned to retain only epicenters, sp <dig> targets, differentially expressed genes, and the genes connecting them. nodes with a hexagonal shape represent epicenters, a golden border around the node indicates sp <dig> target, and a pink border around the node indicates mediator gene. the rank of each epicenter is written next to it in red.  sp <dig> knockdown condition.  <dig> genes occur in the list of top  <dig> epicenters .  control condition.  <dig> genes correspond to top  <dig> epicenters.  <dig> genes correspond to rank  <dig>  and regulate myc, a target of sp <dig>  similarly,  <dig> genes correspond to rank  <dig>  and regulate cebpb



since the data being analysed is of knockdown of a transcription factor , we investigate the targets regulated by sp <dig> by focusing on the highest activity network specific to the control condition. the influence zone for the epicenters with top  <dig> ranks was constructed and pruned as in the perturbed condition. this graph contains  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, and is shown in fig. 5b. myc and cebpb emerged as important genes in this condition. myc is a direct target of sp <dig>  and also regulates other targets of sp <dig>  cebpb is an important mediator gene, which regulates  <dig> targets of sp <dig>  and is regulated by  <dig> epicenters, all of which were ranked  <dig> nd.

in conjunction, the analysis of the two conditions revealed that the effect of sp <dig> knockdown spreads through  <dig> important hubs - myc, cebpb and tp <dig>  regulators of these important hubs were ranked as epicenters by our algorithm. myc has  <dig> target genes which are differentially expressed. znfx <dig>  taf1d, nfx <dig>  tfiif and nfx <dig> are involved in tanscriptional and post transcriptional regulation  <cit> . cdkn2a activity leads to cell cycle arrest. odc <dig> is an enzyme of polyamine metabolism and pfas participates in purine metabolism  <cit> . both metabolic pathways are necessary for dna replication and transcription. nfx <dig> is mainly involved in inflammatory response. tp <dig> also regulates  <dig> genes, of which three genes, namely pttg <dig>  cops <dig> and cdkn2a, are differentally expressed. cops <dig> is one of the members of the cop <dig> signalosome which regulates mutiple signaling pathways  <cit> . pttg <dig> is involved in cell cycle regulation. cebpb regulates  <dig> gene in the control condition, of which two were differentally expressed - sp <dig> and inhbe.

discussion
epitracer identifies nodes at which highly active paths originate and which are able to reach a large fraction of the active network. when annotated with the condition in which they are active, these nodes correspond to the most influential players in that specific condition and are termed epicenters. it is important to note that the epicenter does not necessarily correspond to the source of the perturbation.

epitracer can be expected to have wide applicability, demonstrated here by two entirely different datasets studied in this work. since the algorithm focuses on active nodes and edges, the network on which the analysis is carried out must be chosen based on the context. as demonstrated in case study  <dig>  analysing the perturbed highest activity network is preferable when the perturbation is expected to be an upregulation event. if the perturbation is expected to be a downregulation event, analysing the control highest activity network will yield the set of nodes which were influential before the knockdown . an analysis of the perturbed highest activity network is also useful since it can yield a list of epicenters that are activated in the perturbed condition upon removal of the knocked-out regulator. if the nature of the perturbation is unknown, both highest activity networks should be analysed. a limitation of the algorithm is that the source of the perturbation may not appear in the highest activity networks if its expression level remains low both before and after the perturbation. in such cases epitracer will be able to highlight the highly active nodes close to the source of the perturbation, but not the source itself.

it was observed during the course of this work that the largest strongly connected component  plays an important role in spreading a perturbation through the network. the largest strongly connected component is the largest subgraph in which there exists a path from every node to every other node. it was found that the epicenter was a part of the lscc in the highest activity network under study. if the lscc comprises a big enough percentage of the graph, we believe it might be possible to speed up the algorithm by restricting the search only to the nodes in the lscc.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose a new algorithm, epitracer, to trace the epicenter of perturbations in a condition-specific biological network. the algorithm is capable of extracting the highest activity network specific to each condition under study and ranking the nodes in these highest activity networks with a ripple centrality score, which reflects how well any influence from that node can ripple out into the rest of the network.

the algorithm has been demonstrated on two case studies, one where a gene was overexpressed, and another where a gene was knocked down. in the case of overexpression, epitracer was able to identify the overexpressed gene as the most important epicenter. biological analysis of the top-ranked epicenters showed that all of them had functions relevant to cell cycle progression, and highlighted a scenario where the most important epicenters were involved in either spreading the influence of park <dig> or working to counteract its effect. also,  <dig> of the top  <dig> epicenters showed no significant change in expression level, and yet were found to be biologically meaningful epicenters. this shows that our algorithm is able to highlight more than simple differential expression. the immediate influence zone of park <dig> generated by the epitracer pipeline, and the dysregulated genes in this were also found to be enriched in genes involved in cell cycle regulation. in the knockdown case study, alternative regulators of the knocked-down gene’s targets were highlighted as epicenters. also, the gene that was knocked down was picked up as an epicenter in the control condition. this demonstrates the general applicability of the algorithm. sensitivity analysis has been carried out to show that the epicenters identified by epitracer are largely unaffected by small changes in the network.

the epitracer algorithm identifies the epicenters which either spread a perturbation or respond to it. the paths along which the influence ripples out of the epicenters is highlighted by the condition-specific highest activity network. this gives a system-wide, unbiased view of a disease phenotype, and how the organism responds to it.
