BACKGROUND
highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses  pose a threat for yet another epidemic or pandemic, which can potentially result in severe consequences for both animal and human life. so far, only the low pathogenic avian influenza viruses  of h <dig> and h <dig> serotypes have been shown to be precursors for the hpaiv’s  <cit> . to infect, the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin  precursor, ha <dig>  needs to be cleaved by cellular proteases into functional ha <dig> and ha <dig> subunits  <cit> . lpaiv’s carry a monobasic cleavage site that is recognized only by trypsin-like proteases  <cit>  thus limiting the infection to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts  <cit> . high pathogenicity has been previously linked to insertions in the cleavage site of ha . these insertions allow the ha <dig> to be cleaved by ubiquitously expressed intracellular proteases such as furin  leading to a systematic infection and lethal disease with mortality rates being as high as 100 %. recent studies  have shown that the insertions in the cleavage site of ha may not be sufficient to render the virus highly pathogenic . although the cleavage site certainly is the most important virulence determinant, evidence is accumulating that the hpaiv’s also carry virulence determinants other than the polybasic cleavage sites in the ha protein  <cit> . such determinants may be located outside the cleavage site of the ha protein and spread across all the expressed proteins of the virus creating a suitable environment for high pathogenicity  <cit> . since only h <dig> and h <dig> subtypes are known to become hp and since there are too few hp sequences of the h <dig> subtypes for our analysis, we limited our study to the analysis of h <dig> serotype of the aiv.

we used publicly available protein sequence data for all the proteins of h <dig> subtype of avian influenza viruses   <cit> . pathogenicity is very strongly linked to the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site for naturally occurring viruses  <cit>  and thus aligned sequences of the proteins were annotated with the pathogenicity value  using the presence or absence of insertions in the cleavage site of the corresponding ha protein, respectively. the cleavage site was subsequently removed from the ha protein sequences since we had already used this information to label the sequences. this enables learning other aa positions of the sequences that may be related to the pathogenicity label. ranking of the pathogenicity significant aa positions for each of the proteins was done with monte carlo feature selection   <cit> . rough set theory  <cit>  as implemented by rosetta  <cit>  was applied in constructing rule-based models of pathogenicity using the significant positions. such models are expressed as if-then rules. see fig.  <dig> for a schematic description of the method. the rules explicitly specified aa’s and their combinations that were associated with the pathogenicity of the h <dig> subtype. in addition to already known markers of pathogenicity, we discovered other potential aa positions and mutations that may affect the pathogenicity of h5-aiv. the models were experimentally validated on new, unseen sequences released after we built our models. similar approaches to modeling that we used here have been successfully applied to model many aspects of protein or gene features such as, for instance, cleavability of octamer peptides by hiv- <dig> protease  <cit> , drug resistance  <cit> , binding affinities  <cit>  and participation in biological processes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the applied computational modeling methodology



to the best of our knowledge this work is the first proteome-wide characterization of the pathogenicity landscape of the h <dig> subtype of avian influenza viruses based on all available sequences to date.

RESULTS
high quality predictive models of pathogenicity for all proteins
following mcfs that identified aa positions significant in discriminating high from low pathogenic  sequences , we constructed high quality predictive models of pathogenicity of the h <dig> viruses expressed in the form of if-then rules. application of mcfs was essential in processing this high dimensional data and provided ranking of the importance of the aa positions with respect to discriminating pathogenicity. rosetta was applied to construct rule-based models for each of the proteins using the significant features as selected by mcfs as described in material and methods.table  <dig> the training data

extraction of significant rules from the models
for the ha protein the set of significant rules  consisted of  <dig> rules for high pathogenicity and  <dig> rules for low pathogenicity. similarly, for the na protein we obtained  <dig> rules for high pathogenicity and  <dig> for low pathogenicity. the sets of significant rules are referred to as classifiers in our study. the classifiers for all the proteins are listed in additional file 3: classifiers.xlsx.

high pathogenicity rules in the classifiers were highly accurate for the h5n <dig> subtype sequences
since the hp training sequences were predominantly of the h5n <dig> subtype  , we suspected that the rules for high pathogenicity would predominantly be learning h5n <dig> pathogenicity. this hypothesis was confirmed through re-classification of the training sequences by the classifiers. for the ha protein,  <dig> of the  <dig> h5n <dig> hp sequences were correctly re-classified as hp, and  <dig> of the  <dig> h5n <dig> lp sequences were correctly re-classified as lp. from the total of  <dig> hp sequences of the non-h5n <dig> subtypes, we could only correctly re-classify  <dig> sequences. however,  <dig> of the  <dig> non-h5n <dig> lp sequences were re-classified correctly .

for the na protein, all of the  <dig> h5n <dig> hp sequences were classified correctly as hp and all  <dig> of the  <dig> h5n <dig> lp sequences were also classified correctly. none of the  <dig> non-h5n <dig> hp sequences were correctly classified, while all of the  <dig> non-h5n <dig> lp sequences were correctly classified. the numbers for the remainder of the proteins are shown in fig. 2b and c .

validation of classifiers on new, unseen sequences
our classifiers were generated using data published on  <dig> january  <dig>  we validated our classifiers by classifying new, unseen sequences published after that date. only unique sequences were considered, i.e., sequences identical to the sequences used in learning the models were removed. the cleavage site in these new sequences was removed prior to classification.

for the h5n <dig> subtype sequences, the ha rules performed with accuracy of  <dig>  % classifying  <dig> of  <dig> sequences correctly . rules from the na models classified all of the  <dig> sequences correctly i.e. accuracy 100 %. rules from m <dig>  ns <dig>  ns <dig>  pb <dig>  pb1-f <dig> and pb <dig> gave a perfect classification of the sequences i.e. accuracy was 100 %. m <dig> rules classified  <dig> of  <dig> sequences correctly and np rules classified  <dig> of  <dig> sequences correctly. rules from the pa models were the least accurate with  <dig>  % accuracy by correctly classifying  <dig> of  <dig> sequences.

the non-h5n <dig> type hp sequences were mostly of the h5n <dig> subtype  . interestingly, the classifiers for ha, m <dig>  m <dig> and pb <dig> proteins gave a perfect classification  for the respective protein sequences.  <dig> of  <dig> new pa sequences were also correctly classified. on the other hand only two of the  <dig> for ns <dig> and ns <dig> sequences each, three of the  <dig> np sequences, two of 46 pb <dig> sequences and  <dig> of 41 pb1-f <dig> sequences could be classified correctly with our classifiers. it suggests that the pathogenicity markers carried by these new h5n <dig> sequences in the ha, m <dig>  m <dig>  pb <dig> and pa protein are similar to the ones for the h5n <dig> subtypes.

amino acids and their combinations associated with pathogenicity
filtering for the strongest rules  in the ha classifier produced three rules for high pathogenicity and  <dig> for low pathogenicity . the hp ha rules associated d-43ha <dig>  a-83ha <dig> and i-71ha <dig> with high pathogenicity. the lp-rules associated s-43ha <dig>  d-83ha <dig>  s-107ha <dig>  n-138ha <dig>  d-309ha <dig>  v-302ha <dig>  a-7sp, i-6sp, d-275ha <dig>  n-195ha <dig>  s-240ha <dig>  r-3sp and s-194ha <dig> with low pathogenicity, where ha <dig> and ha <dig> are the two subunits of ha and sp is the signal peptide of the non-cleaved sequence. for the na protein, from the strongest rules , aa residues n- <dig>  g- <dig>  t- <dig>  d- <dig>  h- <dig> and h- <dig> were associated with high pathogenicity and n- <dig>  k- <dig>  v- <dig>  p- <dig>  i- <dig>  i- <dig>  l- <dig>  m- <dig>  s- <dig>  e- <dig>  s- <dig>  k- <dig>  t- <dig>  e- <dig> and s- <dig> were associated with low pathogenicity. the strongest rules for the other proteins are shown in additional file 6: table s7-s <dig>  aa’s and their combinations associated with high and low pathogenicity, respectively, for all the proteins are summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig> the strongest rules for highly and low pathogenic viruses from the ha classifier

accuracy is the percentage of the sequences in the support set correctly classified by the rule. support is the number of sequences that satisfy the “if” conditions of the rule. class-specific-coverage is the percentage per class  of the sequences that support the rule and are correctly classified by the rule. for instance, if a rule is an hp class rule then the class-specific-coverage gives the percentage of the hp sequences classified correctly by this rule

aa’s for the ha protein are shown to be either of ha <dig>  ha <dig> or signal peptide . aa’s for the na protein shown are numbered according to the whole length sequences i.e. the sequences without the stalk deletion



aa mutations associated with the shift of pathogenicity from low to high
to associate aa mutations with a shift in pathogenicity from low to high we compared the strongest hp and lp rules that have the same position but a different residue. there were two such cases in the strongest ha rules.

for the ha protein, all the lp rules that specified position 43ha <dig> had a serine residue and the hp rules with position 43ha <dig> had an aspartic acid residue there. hence, the mutation s-43ha1-d was associated with a shift in pathogenicity from low to high. similarly, mutation d-83ha1-a was also associated with a pathogenicity shift from low to high. by the same token, mutations s-269-d, e-41-h in the na protein, s-48-n, k-212-n in the ns <dig> protein, v-166-a in the m <dig> protein, g-14-e in the m <dig> protein, k-77-r, s-377-n in the np protein and q-48-p in the pb1-f <dig> protein  were associated with shifts of pathogenicity from low to high.table  <dig> aa mutations associated with a shift of pathogenicity from low to high

discussion
the goal of this study was to identify aa’s and their combinations other than the cleavage site of the ha protein that have the potential to affect the pathogenicity of the h <dig> subtype of aiv. another goal was to associate specific aa changes or mutations with a shift of pathogenicity from low to high. to this end, mathematical modeling using known methods of monte carlo feature selection and rough sets were applied to all the viral proteins. sets of statistically significant rules were extracted from the models and called classifiers. validation of the classifiers performed on new, unseen sequences, i.e. sequences published after we extracted the data for our analysis, showed that the model was indeed very highly predictive for at least the period of 10 months, i.e. between january and october  <dig> 

among the identified positions, the most interesting seemed to be the ones that defined mutations associated with the shift from lp to hp in several of the proteins. the positions and their residue values defined the genetic background of the aiv necessary to produce a high pathogenicity as defined by the characteristics of the ha cleavage site. this finding was consistent with the idea of pathogenicity markers outside the cleavage site of the ha protein  <cit> .

the results of re-classification showed that the rules of the classifiers for high pathogenicity were able to correctly and with very high accuracy classify h5n <dig> hp sequences, while non-h5n <dig> hp sequences were classified poorly. however, regardless of the subtype, the re-classification of all lp sequences was done with high accuracy although the prevalence of h5n <dig> lp was low, as opposed to the prevalence of non-h5n <dig> lp sequences. this suggests that the mechanism of low pathogenicity is similar in all h <dig> type sequences, while the mechanism of high pathogenicity of h5n <dig> is specific to this subtype.

furthermore, it is interesting to notice that the new non-h5n <dig> hp sequences were mostly of the h5n <dig> subtype that caused outbreaks in south korea earlier this year  <cit> . following genetic analysis, this reassortant virus is thought to have borrowed ha, pb <dig> and np segments from h5n1-like viruses, pb <dig>  pa, m and ns segment from h4n2-like viruses, and na from the previous h5n8-like avian influenza viruses  <cit> . we observed a perfect classification by the models of ha, m <dig>  m <dig>  pb <dig> and pa but poor classification by the rest of the models. notably, the pb <dig> and np protein models performed poorly even though these segments are thought to be contributed by h5n1-like viruses with which we trained the models. this may suggest that the pb <dig> and np segments have adapted to h5n8-specific highly pathogenic viral background. the perfect classification of the m <dig>  m <dig>  pb <dig> and pa models, despite them being contributed by h4n2-like viruses, suggests that the markers of high pathogenicity in these proteins are similar to the h5n <dig> type markers. it would follow that the viral background necessary for high pathogenicity in the new h5n <dig> viruses is partly  similar to that of the h5n1-like viruses. nevertheless, the fact that this background differs in the ns <dig>  ns <dig>  pb <dig>  pb1-f <dig>  np and na proteins supports our conclusion that the markers of high pathogenicity are subtype specific.

a survey of the aa’s, which have been shown to be important for the h <dig> pathogenicity in previous studies, suggests that our methods pinpoint biologically relevant locations in various viral proteins. our positions were, among others, in the immediate neighborhood of positions that have been indicated previously, in the vicinity of active sites of the proteins and in a few cases were a direct hit of a position that have been described earlier as important for pathogenicity. however, since most of the published results have not been done in the context of pathogenicity the comparisons needs to be treated with caution. to the best of our knowledge, our findings are the first ones to be based on a large number of available sequence data and are statistically significant.

however, it eventually will be necessary to confirm these findings experimentally not only by testing them on new, unseen sequences, but also by testing specific combinations of mutations to find out minimal sets that induce high pathogenicity. our computational work clearly shows where to search and makes this search plausible by a dramatic restriction to a manageable number of cases. further studies of the particular roles of these novel markers outside the polybasic cleavage site of the ha protein, and on the other proteins, as well as the roles of activating proteases in various hosts, affecting these newly detected marker sites, will be required.

CONCLUSIONS
we used sequences of all  <dig> proteins of the avian influenza a virus to build high quality and easy to read if-then rule-based models of pathogenicity for each protein. from the rules we extracted a map of markers of both high and low pathogenicity in all the proteins. our models were able to correctly predict low pathogenicity independently of the na subtype indicating that low pathogenicity was common to all h <dig> viruses irrespectively of na type. the same was not true for high pathogenicity where we could only correctly classify the hp h5n <dig> sequences with high accuracies  but not the hp non-h5n <dig> sequences. surprisingly, the pathogenicity of the new and unseen h5n <dig> subtype sequences, that are currently circulating, could be perfectly predicted with the h5n <dig> models of ha, m <dig>  m <dig>  pa and pb <dig> and poorly with the models for the other proteins. this suggests that the pathogenicity markers of the h5n8-like viruses are similar to h5n1-like viruses in these proteins but different from h5n1-like viruses in the rest of the proteins. in summary, we identified a viral background for the h5n <dig> type viruses that, in addition to the previously known insertions in the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein, seems to be necessary for a virus to become highly pathogenic. this study narrows down the possible combinatorial space for pathogenicity analysis and provides a platform for further analysis and biological verification of the discovered pathogenicity markers. the detection and identification of the additional sites and factors of virulence alteration in the viral genomes provide basic novel information for the i) better understanding of viral evolution; ii) for the improvement of diagnosis; iii) and for the development of more effective vaccine candidates and other measures to control the devastating diseases caused by aiv all over the world.
