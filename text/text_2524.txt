BACKGROUND
soil contains a diverse range of fungi that are parasites on nematodes  <cit> . these fungi include the nematode-trapping fungi, which have specific hyphal structures in which the nematodes can be trapped. the interest in studying these fungi is due to their potential use as biological control agents for plant and animal parasitic nematodes  <cit> . the traps of the nematode-trapping fungi develop from hyphae and can be formed spontaneously or be induced in response to signals from the environment  <cit> . there is a large variation in the morphology of the traps, and the type of trap depends on the species  <cit> . in some species, the traps consist of an erect branch that is covered by an adhesive material. in other species such as in the well-studied arthrobotrys oligospora, the trap is a three-dimensional net. a third type of trap is the adhesive knob, which is a single celled structure. finally, there are some species that capture nematodes using a mechanical trap called a constricting ring  <cit> . despite the large morphological variation in trapping structures, phylogenetic analyses inferred from molecular data has shown that the majority of the nematode-trapping fungi belong to a monophyletic group consisting of a single family of the order orbiliales  . furthermore, these studies have shown that the nematode-trapping fungi have evolved along two major lineages: one basal lineage leading to species with constricting rings and one lineage containing species that form adhesive traps, including three-dimensional networks, knobs and branches .

the trapping mechanisms of the species with constricting rings and those with adhesive traps are distinctively different  <cit> . the constricting ring consists of three cells. when the nematode enters the ring, the cells inflate and the nematode is trapped. the closure is very rapid  and is triggered by pressure of the nematode on the constricting-ring cells  <cit> . ultrastructural examinations revealed that the cell wall of the constricting-ring cells is folded; when the cells inflate, the folded cell wall balloons out and forms the new cell wall  <cit> . the adhesive trap is surrounded by a layer of fibrillar, extracellular polymers. although the molecular mechanism has not yet been characterized, ultrastructural studies have shown that the fibrillar layer is reorganized during the attachment of the traps to the nematode cuticle  <cit> . following the trapping of nematodes, the infection mechanisms appear to be rather similar in the species with constricting rings and adhesive traps: the fungus forms a penetration tube that pierces the nematode cuticle. during penetration the nematode becomes paralyzed. subsequently, the internal tissues are rapidly colonized and digested by fungal hyphae  <cit> .

in laboratory assays, most nematode-trapping fungi can trap and infect a range of different nematode species  <cit> . however, there are a number of studies showing that different species and even strains of nematode-trapping fungi can vary in their host preferences. for example, in vitro predacity tests of four nematode-trapping fungi showed that the constricting-ring species arthrobotrys dactyloides was the most efficient species in capturing and killing the root knot nematode meloidogyne graminicola
 <cit> . further studies on a. dactyloides showed that even strains of this species differed in their predacity to meloidogyne incognita
 <cit> . significant differences in the susceptibility to nematode-trapping fungi have also been shown in field trials with the cyst nematode heterodera schachtii and the root knot nematode meloidogyne javanica
 <cit> .

recently, the infection mechanism of nematode-trapping fungi has been examined using the tools of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. the genomes of two nematode-trapping fungi have been published; the net-forming arthrobotrys oligospora
 <cit>  and the adhesive knob-forming monacrosporium haptotylum
 <cit> . the two genomes are similar in size and consist of ~62% core genes that are shared with other fungi, ~20% genes that are specific for the two species and ~16% genes that are unique for each genome  <cit> . comparative genome analysis showed that the genomes of nematode-trapping fungi have been expanded in a number of gene families, including extracellular peptidases such subtilisins; homologs to several virulence factors identified in plant-pathogenic fungi; and families of putative cell-surface adhesins containing carbohydrate-binding domains such as the wsc domain and the mucin domain  <cit> . transcriptome analysis showed that m. haptotylum expresses a unique set of genes during the early stages of infection of the nematode caenorhabditis briggsae. among these is a large proportion that belongs to gene families that are significantly expanded in the nematode-trapping fungi. transcripts encoding small secreted proteins  and many species-specific genes were also highly expressed during the early phase of infection. many of them were orphans, that is, genes lacking both homologs and pfam domains  <cit> . furthermore, quantitative proteomics revealed proteins that were significant upregulated in the knob compared with the vegetative mycelia in m. haptotylum. among the upregulated proteins were peptidases, tyrosinase and proteins containing the wsc domain  <cit> .

in this study, we have examined in more detail the molecular basis of the infection process in nematode-trapping fungi that have various trapping mechanisms, including adhesive nets , adhesive branches  and constricting rings   <cit> . two plant-parasitic nematodes were used as hosts, the root knot nematode meloidogyne hapla and the sugar beet cyst nematode h. schachtii. these are both sedentary endoparasites belonging to the group of nematodes that causes the most damages to crops  <cit> . comparative transcriptome analysis of the infection, including the adhesion, penetration and digestion stages, showed that the divergence in interspecific gene expression was significantly larger than that related to the nematode host used. we identified a common set of genes that were expressed by all three fungi and a more variable set that were regulated depending on either the fungal species or the nematode host.

RESULTS
infection experiments
the nematodes m. hapla or h. schachtii were added to plates containing the nematode-trapping fungi a. oligospora, m. cionopagum or a. dactyloides and the infection was followed under a light microscope . the following five combinations of fungi and nematodes were examined: a. oligospora and m. hapla ), a. oligospora and h. schachtii ), a. dactyloides and m. hapla ), a. dactyloides and h. schachtii ), and m. cionopagum and h. schachtii ). there was a large difference in the infection rate, both between the nematodes and between the fungi . cyst nematodes  showed lower susceptibility to nematode-trapping fungi than did root knot nematodes , which is in agreement with an earlier study by jaffee and muldoon  <cit> . this might be due to differences in the composition of the nematode cuticle  <cit> . between the fungi, a. dactyloides infected m. hapla at a faster rate than a. oligospora infected m. hapla. a. dactyloides colonized h. schachtii at a faster rate than the other species, especially m. cionopagum. the observation that species with constricting rings are more efficient in capturing and killing nematodes than nematode-trapping fungi with other types of trapping structures has been made in earlier studies  <cit> .figure  <dig>

characterization of the transcriptome libraries
the number of reads obtained by the  <dig> sequencing of the five cdna libraries corresponding to these species combinations ranged from  <dig>  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> . based on these sequences, three different data sets were created . to generate the “highly expressed transcripts” data set, the reads were assembled into isotigs , and low abundance reads , short isotigs  and non-fungal sequences were removed. the number of the filtered isotigs in the five libraries varied between  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> and their average sizes varied between  <dig>  <dig> to  <dig> 237 bp. almost all of the assembled isotigs  had fungal matches: a few matched species from nematoda  and a few matched other species . to identify the set of transcripts that was most highly expressed in each library, the reads of the isotigs were normalized using the reads per kilobase pair method. this method fitted better than the reads per kilobase per million read  method to the expectation that most transcripts have similar relative expression abundance between samples . in each library, the  <dig> most expressed isotigs  were analyzed.table  <dig>

flowchart of the data analysis. five different cdna libraries were sequenced and the reads were used to generate three different data sets. first, the data set “highly expressed transcripts” were retrieved by assembling the reads of each library into isotigs  and normalizing the read counts. using this approach, the  <dig> most highly expressed transcripts in each library were retrieved . second, the data set “differentially expressed uniref <dig> clusters” was obtained by matching the isotig sequences using blastx  <cit>  to uniref <dig> clusters  <cit> . the procedure organized the isotigs into putative orthologs for which expression levels could directly be compared between the five libraries. third, to identify the data set “host-specific gene expression” the reads from the two libraries of a. oligospora were mapped to the genome sequence of this fungus  <cit> . ao denotes a. oligospora and m. hapla; ao, a. oligospora and h. schachtii; ad, a. dactyloides and m. hapla; ad, a. dactyloides and h. schachtii; and mc, m. cionopagum and h. schachtii. further details of the libraries are shown in table  <dig> 



comparing transcriptomes between species with not yet sequenced genomes is challenging due to the difficulties in identifying one-to-one orthologs. to circumvent this problem, we here clustered the isotigs into uniref <dig> clusters. uniref <dig> clusters are based on pre-computed sequence clusters of the uniprot database that have at least  <dig> percent similarity and  <dig> percent coverage  <cit> . istotigs were only grouped to uniref <dig> clusters if passing a given threshold value  and only one isotig per fungal species  were assigned to a given uniref <dig> cluster. a recent study including data from seven fungal genomes revealed that the grouping of gene sequences into uniref <dig> clusters using the described procedure are in close agreement with traditional ortholog clustering methods . furthermore, the risk of clustering non-orthologous gene duplicates into a given uniref <dig> cluster is reduced in nematode-trapping due to the rapid divergence of gene duplicates generated by repeat induced point  mutations  <cit> . in our analyses,  <dig>  <dig> of the in total  <dig>  <dig> isotigs matched to  <dig>  <dig> unique uniref <dig> protein clusters. the reads of these putative orthologs were normalized with deseq  <cit> . based on the hypothesis that most transcripts are not differentially expressed, the analysis showed that a proper normalization was obtained using the 5% most highly expressed uniref <dig> clusters . this cohort  contained  <dig> unique uniref <dig> clusters.

the third data set, “host-specific gene expression”, was generated for identifying genes that were differentially expressed due to the nematode host species. because the genome of a. oligospora is available  <cit> , the analysis focused on comparing the transcriptional response of this fungus when infecting m. hapla and h. schachtii. the reads from the ao library were mapped to  <dig>  <dig> genes and those from the ao library to  <dig>  <dig> genes .

divergence in gene expression
to compare the functional groups of genes that were expressed in the different libraries, the abundances and expression levels of pfam domains in the “top  <dig> transcripts” data set were analyzed. the number of pfam domains found in the five libraries varied between  <dig> and  <dig> . in total,  <dig> pfam domains were found in at least one of the libraries.

a principal component analysis  of the abundances of the pfam domains showed that the libraries mainly clustered according to the fungal species . the first axis  separated the two libraries of a. dactyloides  and ad) from those of a. oligospora  and ao). the second axis  separated m. cionopagum ) from the two arthrobotrys species. clearly, in both a. dactyloides and a. oligospora, the divergence in pfam expression patterns associated with fungal species was larger than that related to the host nematode species.figure  <dig>

analysis of the expression levels of the uniref <dig> clusters confirmed these patterns. a pca based on the 5% most highly expressed uniref <dig> clusters showed that the first axis  separated the two libraries of a. dactyloides from the two libraries of a. oligospora . m. cionopagum was separated from the other libraries along the second axis . scatter plots showed that the numbers of uniref <dig> clusters that were differentially expressed more than twofold between the fungal species were greater than between the host nematode species .figure  <dig>

commonly expressed transcripts
in agreement with a previous study examining the infection-regulated transcriptome of m. haptotylum
 <cit> , the highly expressed transcripts of a. dactyloides, a. oligospora and m. cionopagum were enriched with those predicted to encode proteins with a secretion signal and those encoding orphans . to characterize the core set of transcripts that was highly expressed by all fungi, the commonly expressed pfam domains of a. dactyloides, a. oligospora and m. cionopagum were identified . in total this set contained  <dig> pfam domains that were annotated into putative functions . the core set of pfam domains included several protein families that have previously been identified to be highly expressed by a. oligospora and m. haptotylum during infection of c. briggsae, such as subtilisin , aspartyl peptidases, cfem   <cit> , and the carbohydrate-binding wsc domain  <cit> . in addition, the core set contained a number of pfam domains found in proteins involved in fungal stress response, cell signaling, organization of the cytoskeleton, vesicular transport and membrane transport, as well as several families of calcium-binding proteins and transcription factors. domains of enzymes and proteins involved in the carbon, energy and amino-acid metabolism and protein synthesis were also highly expressed.table  <dig>

 <cit> .



furthermore, transcripts containing the atg <dig> domain were highly expressed in all fungi. atg <dig> is an essential protein in the autophagic pathway  <cit>  and disruption of a homolog of this gene in a. oligospora leads to reduced trap formation  <cit> . in addition, all three fungi expressed transcripts with the pfam domain ricinb_lectin_ <dig> . ricin-b lectins are ribosome-inactivating proteins  consisting of a catalytic a-chain and a sugar-binding b-chain  <cit> . all fungi have a ricinb_lectin_ <dig> transcript that match to g1x3g <dig> in a. oligospora. g1x3g <dig> is a protein with a length of  <dig> amino-acid residues , without a secretion signal and with low sequence similarity to other ricinb lectins in the uniprot database. a ricinb_lectin_ <dig> domain-containing protein  with nematotoxic activity against caenorhabditis elegans has been identified in the basidiomycete marasmius oreades
 <cit> . the nematotoxicity was dependant on the cysteine protease activity of moa and the binding of its lectin domain to glycosphingolipids in the worm intestine. moa consists of  <dig> aa and lacks a classical secretion signal  <cit> . sclerotinia sclerotiorum agglutinin  is a ricinb_lectin_ <dig> domain-containing protein with a length more similar to the g1x3g <dig> protein in a. oligospora
 <cit> . ssa has a length of  <dig> aa, lacks secretion signal and shows insecticidal properties when fed to the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum
 <cit> .

previous studies have shown that subtilisins  are important virulence factors in nematode-trapping fungi. in a. oligospora they have a key role in the early stages of infection, including immobilization of the captured nematode  <cit> . a. oligospora has  <dig> genes containing the peptidase_s <dig> domain  <cit> . however, only one transcript containing the peptidase_s <dig> domain was identified among the highly expressed transcripts in each library of ao and ao. blastx searches showed that both transcripts displayed the highest sequence homology to the a. oligospora protein g1xll <dig>  the other cdna libraries contained also only one transcript with the peptidase_s <dig> domain among the top  <dig> expressed genes. the three transcripts in ad, ad and mc all displayed the highest sequence homology to h072_ <dig> in m. haptotylum. interestingly, g1xll <dig> and h072_ <dig> are orthologs . furthermore, g1xll <dig> was the most expressed peptidase_s <dig> gene in a. oligospora during early infection  of c. briggsae, and h072_ <dig> was the second most expressed peptidase_s <dig> gene in m. haptotylum during early infection  of c. briggsae
 <cit> . h072_ <dig> was also identified in the proteome of both the knob and the mycelia in m. haptotylum
 <cit> . this shows that despite the large number of peptidase_s <dig> genes only a few are highly expressed during infection.

stress proteins were highly expressed in all fungi independent of trapping structure. they included heat-shock proteins and chaperones such as dnaj, hsp <dig> and hsp90; gluthatione s-transferases; and antioxidant enzymes such as thioredoxin and catalase. antioxidants are enzymes involved in the protection of the cell from oxidative damages induced by reactive oxygen species   <cit> . ros are continuously produced in the cell as byproducts from various metabolic pathways and have an important role in signaling  <cit> . in the plant-pathogenic fungus magnaporthe grisea, ros-generating nadph oxidases  are essential for pathogenicity  <cit> . the authors  <cit>  suggest that the generated ros accumulate in the appressorium to facilitate oxidative cross-linking of cell-wall proteins. this leads to a strengthening of the cell wall of the appressorium that will eventually resist high turgor pressure  <cit> . transcripts with sequence similarity to the nox proteins in m. grisea were regulated in all fungi of our study during infection. however, none of them were found among our top  <dig> most expressed transcripts.

interspecific variation in gene expression
to identify the variable sets of transcripts, that is, the transcripts that were differentially regulated depending on the fungal species, the expression levels of the putative orthologs identified using the uniref <dig> clusters were compared among the libraries . among these were transcripts encoding peptidases , lectins , tyrosinase, transcription factors, cell-signaling components, atg <dig>  various stress response proteins, proteins containing the wsc domain and the duf <dig> domain. duf <dig> is a domain of unknown function that is found in the gas <dig> protein of m. grisea, which participates in appressorial penetration and lesion formation  <cit> . interestingly, duf <dig> was highly expressed in m. cionopagum but not expressed at all in a. dactyloides. duf <dig> was identified in  <dig> transcripts among the top  <dig> most expressed transcripts in the mc library. during a. oligospora infections, this domain was identified in one transcript in ao and in four transcripts in ao among the top  <dig> most expressed transcripts. duf <dig> is an expanded gene family in nematode-trapping fungi and both m. haptotylum and a. oligospora have  <dig> genes encoding this domain  <cit> . seventeen of these genes were previously found among the 10% most expressed genes during nematode infection by m. haptotylum, whereas only two were among the 10% most expressed genes during nematode infection by a. oligospora
 <cit> . the duf <dig> domain is thus highly expressed during infection among the species that form adhesive branches and adhesive knobs. further studies are needed to investigate the function of the duf <dig> domain in the nematode-trapping fungi during infection.figure  <dig>

transcripts encoding the fungal fruit-body lectin  and the d-mannose binding lectin  were only highly expressed in a. oligospora and not in the other two fungi . in the uniref <dig> cluster containing the fb_lectin domain we identified the previously studied aol lectin   <cit> . the transcript matching to this cluster was the third most expressed of all transcripts during ao infection and the 25th most expressed of all transcripts during ao infection. earlier studies have shown that aol functions as a storage protein during both saprophytic and parasitic growth  <cit> . however, deletion of this gene did not affect the fungus’ ability to infect nematodes  <cit> .

previous studies have shown that proteins containing the carbohydrate-binding domain wsc comprise a large and rapidly evolving gene family in m. haptotylum
 <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> wsc-containing proteins in m. haptotylum revealed a clade of  <dig> wsc paralogs  <cit> . this clade contains only one  of the  <dig> wsc proteins identified in a. oligospora
 <cit> . thirteen of the  <dig> wsc paralogs of m. haptotylum were at least twofold upregulated during the infection of the nematode c. briggsae
 <cit> 
. in this study, transcripts encoding wsc proteins were highly expressed by all fungi during infection of plant-parasitic nematodes . the largest number of transcripts encoding wsc domain proteins was expressed by m. cionopagum. in total,  <dig> transcripts of wsc domain proteins were identified in the mc library, of which seven were found among the top  <dig> transcripts. four of these transcripts displayed closest sequence homology to proteins found in the expanded clade of wsc proteins of m. haptotylum
 <cit> . the libraries of a. oligospora and a. dactyloides contained a lower number of transcripts of wsc domain proteins. among the top  <dig> transcripts, the ao, ao and ad libraries each had two wsc domain proteins, whereas none were found in the ad library. transcripts displaying highest sequence homology to the previously mentioned a. oligospora protein g1x6q <dig> were identified in both the ao and the ao libraries. the deduced proteins of two highly expressed wsc transcripts in a. dactyloides did not show any sequence similarity to the proteins found in the expanded clade of paralogs in m. haptotylum
 <cit> . taken together, the comparative transcriptome analysis shows that the wsc domain proteins comprise a large and divergent gene family that is highly expressed during pathogenesis in nematode-trapping fungi. the specific sets of genes that are expressed depend on the fungal species and the nematodes being infected, which suggests that the function of the wsc proteins is to contribute to the specialization of the trapping mechanisms.

virulence associated transcripts
a blast search of the top  <dig> transcripts in each library was conducted in the pathogen–host interaction protein database   <cit> . phi-base contains experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence and effector genes from fungi, oomycetes and bacterial pathogens. in total,  <dig> unique phi-base genes were identified. genes with sequence similarity to seven of them were found in at least ten gene models in either m. haptotylum or a. oligospora
 <cit> . they included rbt <dig> from candida albicans, which is necessary for virulence  <cit> . the function of rbt <dig> is unknown but it contains a cap  domain  <cit> . among the  <dig> identified phi-base genes,  <dig> were highly expressed by all fungal species  and  <dig> were highly expressed by one or two of the fungal species . the phi-base genes expressed by all fungi included stress response genes and several cell signaling genes containing the ras domain. the phi-base genes that differ in expression between the fungi included aspartic proteases and the gas  <dig> and gas  <dig> proteins of m. grisea
 <cit>  that contains the duf <dig> domain.

host-specific gene expression
a scatter plot of the gene expression in a. oligospora during the infection of m. hapla versus h. schachtii showed that a majority of the genes had similar expression levels . however,  <dig> genes were expressed at levels at least 5-fold higher during infection of m. hapla than during infection of h. schachtii , and  <dig> genes were expressed at levels at least 5-fold higher in h. schachtii than in m. hapla . genes predicted to encode secreted proteins were enriched among the differentially expressed genes in both nematodes. the proportion of secreted proteins among the upregulated genes in m. hapla  or ad) was  <dig> %  and in h. schachtii  or ad) was  <dig> % . in comparison, the proportion of secreted proteins among all genes that were used for the host-specific gene expression analysis was  <dig> % .figure  <dig>

the differentially expressed genes encoding proteins with a predicted secretion signal were further characterized . these included peptidases and several gene families that were expanded in the genomes of nematode-trapping fungi, such as duf <dig>  wsc and tyrosinase  <cit> . one chitinase was identified that contains a lysm domain. chitinases with lysm domains  have been shown to have sequence similarity to the yeast killer toxin of kluyveromyces lactis

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study examining the variation in gene expression patterns among nematode-trapping fungi during infection of different host species. comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the divergence in gene expression between the fungal species was significantly larger than that related to the nematode host. a core set of transcripts that were highly expressed by all three fungi was identified. this core set included subtilisins, aspartic proteases and proteins containing the cfem domain. these genes were also highly expressed by a. oligospora and m. haptotylum during infection of c. briggsae
 <cit> . also within this core set, a putative nematotoxic protein was identified, the ricin-b lectin. a more variable set of transcripts being regulated depending on the fungal species was also identified. a small set of genes was identified showing differential expression depending on the host. this set was enriched in genes encoding secreted proteins and also included several gene families that were expanded in the genomes of nematode-trapping fungi  <cit> . information on the genetic basis of the interspecific variation in the trapping mechanisms and host preferences fungi will be useful for researchers who are screening for more potent biological control agents of nematode-trapping fungi.
