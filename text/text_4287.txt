BACKGROUND
robust oscillations are ubiquitous in biology such as circadian rhythms and cell cycles  <cit> . robustness is the ability to resume reliable operation in the face of different types of perturbations: environmental and genetic changes, parameter uncertainty, and stochastic fluctuations  <cit> . it is critically important to understand the mechanisms by which biological oscillators robustly work in ever-fluctuating environments.

to quantify biochemical systems' robustness to fluctuations in all the kinetic parameters, multiparameter sensitivity  was used  <cit> . although mps is given by the sum of the squared single-parameter sensitivities, it represents how fragile the system's output is when small, random, and simultaneous fluctuations are provided to all kinetic parameters  <cit> . mps is mathematically equal to the normalized variance calculated by the monte carlo method  <cit> . use of mps has revealed that negative feedback loops with multiple phosphorylations produce oscillators robust to parameter uncertainty  <cit> . the dual feedback model, a simplified version of the drosophila per-tim feedback model  <cit> , was found to be the most robust and entrainable among many feedback models with various connection logics  <cit> .

both numerical and analytical approaches are important for an understanding of design principles underlying robust biological oscillators. a number of numerical studies have been reported for the biological oscillators and many of mathematical models are available from databases such as jws online  <cit> , biomodels  <cit>  and biofnet  <cit> . numerical analyses have revealed the mechanisms of how a variety of feedback structures produce robust oscillators  <cit>  and identified critical kinetic parameters that are related to changes in the period and amplitude  <cit> . although numerical simulations are useful for a quantitative understanding of how complicated biological oscillators behave, they do not provide explicit information on how the period, amplitude and their robustness depend on kinetic parameters.

on the other hand, analytical solutions directly link the mechanisms and kinetic parameters to dynamic properties such as period and amplitude. however, analytical studies for biological oscillators are scarce compared to numerical counterparts. most of analytical studies  <cit>  focused on whether their models oscillate, but not on the robustness of period and amplitude. kut et al  <cit>  provided the analytical expressions for the period and amplitude for elowitz-leibler repressilator  <cit>  and barkai-leibler circadian clock  <cit> . their work is a great step toward an understanding of how the dynamic properties depend on kinetic parameters. however, the models they analyzed lack generality. their analytical solutions are not applicable to other biological oscillators. to our knowledge, few analytical solutions for the period and amplitude have been reported. analytical solutions for a general model of negative feedback loops, which are common structures to biological oscillators  <cit> , greatly contribute to an understanding of design principles underlying robust biological oscillators.

in this paper, we present analytical solutions for the period and amplitude, and their associated mpss for a general model of negative feedback oscillators. the analytical solutions are in agreement with numerical solutions of their ordinary differential equations. our analytical or theoretical study of mpss reveals the mechanisms by which negative feedback loops in biology generate robust oscillations. we present the first mathematical proof that long negative feedback loops make oscillators robust to parameter fluctuations by the distributed time-delay mechanism.

RESULTS
negative feedback oscillator model
we consider a general model of negative feedback oscillators with arbitrary loop length, where the feedback is imposed by the last species of the cascade on the first species. figure  <dig> shows a schematic diagram of the negative feedback oscillator model. the dynamics is described by a set of differential equations:

  dx1dt=β1⋅θ-α1x1dx2dt=β2⋅θ-α2x2⋮dxndt=βn⋅θ-αnxn 

where xi is the concentration of the ith molecular species , αi is the decay rate constant, βi is the production rate constant, and ki is the threshold for turning on/off the production of the target molecular species . αi, βi and ki take positive values. n is the number of molecular species or indicates feedback loop length.  θ is the unit step function given by

  θ= <dig> 

where  a and  b are arbitrary positive values. introducing the step function makes dynamic models tractable  <cit> . this on/off behavior arises from a sigmoidal hill function. ki corresponds to the concentration of a regulator molecule at which the production rate of a target molecule reaches a half maximum in hill function. xi takes a positive value in the range of . the negative feedback oscillator model can produce oscillations when both n≥ <dig> and ki<βi/αi  are satisfied. it has been proved that this type of negative feedback models cannot generate a sustained oscillation when n< <dig> <cit> . an example of the dynamics is shown in figure  <dig> 

since at least one negative feedback loop is necessary for any biochemical networks to produce oscillations  <cit> , the above model is found everywhere as a network motif in biological oscillatory networks. for example, circadian clock networks can be described by assuming that xi are clock genes or specifically modified forms of clock proteins. our model can also be found in the field of synthetic biology. elowitz-leibler repressilator  <cit>  and atkinson's genetic circuit  <cit>  can be considered as slightly modified versions of our model.

analytical solutions for period, amplitude and their associated mpss
the period and amplitude were symbolically solved as follows. first, we divided a cycle of oscillations into time intervals . next, we obtained the interval times, peaks and troughs. finally, we connected all the intervals to calculate the period and amplitude . the period  and the ith species amplitude εi for the oscillatory model of eq  are given by

  τ=-∑i=1nlnαi 

  εi=c11∏j=1nγjα1/αj-1 ci1∏j=inγjαi/αj ∏j=1i-1δjαi/αj-1  

where γi and δi are

  γi=ki-βi/αici <dig> 

  δi=kici <dig> 

cij  are the integral constants:

  ci1=k <dig> ∏j=2nδjα1/αj-β1α1 ki ∏j=1i-1γjαi/αj ∏j=i+1nδjαi/αj-βiαi kn ∏j=1n-1γjαn/αj-βnαn  

  ci2=c <dig> ∏j=1nγjα1/αj+β1α1 ci <dig> ∏j=inγjαi/αj ∏j=1i-1δjαi/αj+βiαi  

although cij are hard to solve in symbolic form, they can be determined by numerically solving the system of eqs -.

assuming that the peak and trough of xi are βi/αi and zero, respectively, the integral constants can be determined without any numerical computations, and the analytical solutions for the period  and the ith species amplitude εi are given by 

  τ=-∑i=1nlnαi 

  εi=βiαi 

where ρi is the ratio of the threshold ki to the amplitude βi/αi:

  ρi=kiαiβi 

multiparameter sensitivity  represents how fragile system's properties are to fluctuations in kinetic parameters . the period mps Φτ and amplitude mps Φεi are given by

  Φτ=∑i=1nlnαi-1-2ρiαi2+21-2ρiαi2∑i=1nlnαi <dig> 

  Φεi= <dig> 

validation of the analytical solutions
first, we like to validate the analytical solutions given by eqs - . in order to determine cij, fsolve function of matlab  was used. the mpss for period and amplitude were numerically calculated by providing a small perturbation to the values of αi, βi and ki . the computed period, amplitude and mpss are referred to as the semi-analytical solutions because numerical methods were partially used. the semi-analytical solutions were compared with the numerical integration solutions. the numerical integration solutions for the period and amplitude were obtained by numerically integrating eq . table  <dig> summarizes the methods to obtain the semi-analytical and numerical integration solutions. we assigned uniform random values over  to αi and βi, and those over  to ki. the semi-analytical solutions were consistent with the numerical integration solutions . thus, the analytical solutions given by eqs - were validated.

in addition to the correctness of the solutions, the semi-analytical approach is computationally more efficient than the numerical integration approach. when n= <dig>  the semi-analytical approach  required  <dig>  sec per parameter set in order to calculate the period, amplitude and their associated mpss. on the other hand, the numerical integration approach  required  <dig> sec per parameter set. although it looks computationally inexpensive to numerically integrate the differential equations of eq , it takes much computational cost because of 'stiffness' that comes from the step function of eq .

next, we like to validate the analytical solutions given by eqs - and eqs - . the solutions given by eqs - and eqs - are referred to as the full analytical solutions because they are free of any numerical methods . we compared the full and semi-analytical solutions. we assigned random values to kinetic parameters as we did for the comparison between the semi-analytical and numerical integration solutions. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  the full and semi-analytical solutions are consistent especially when the feedback loop is long, because the assumptions  are met when the feedback loop is long . even for the short loop , the differences between the full and semi-analytical solutions are less than an order of magnitude for most parameter sets. note that, in figure 4d, the full analytical solutions for the amplitude mps are always two, independent of kinetic parameter values ). although some symbols seem scattered away from the diagonal line in figure 4d, most of the symbols are so concentrated on the diagonal line that the full and semi-analytical solutions are consistent. in summary, the analytical solutions given by eqs - and eqs - were validated.

effect of changes in kinetic parameters on period and its mps
having validated the analytical solutions given by eqs - and eqs -, we investigated how the period and period mps depend on the values of kinetic parameters  and ). figure s <dig> shows that how the period depends on kinetic parameters. for simplicity, we assumed n= <dig>  αi=α, βi=β, ki=k , and ρ=kα/β. when the period is given as a function of , it reaches the minimal values at ρ= <dig>  . when the period is given as a function of β or k, it reaches the minimal values at  . note that the negative feedback oscillator model produces oscillations only when k<β/α . figure s <dig>  shows how the period mps depends on kinetic parameters. the period mps always reaches the minimal value  <dig>  at ρ= <dig> , implying that the period mps depends solely on ρ .

assuming αi=α and ρi=ρ , eq  reduces to

  Φτ=fn 

where

  f=ln-1-2ρ1-ρ2+21-2ρ1-ρ2ln <dig> 

f reaches the minimal value  <dig>  at ρ= <dig> , and limρ→1f=∞ . eq  shows that ρ has a significant effect on the period mps. in order to reduce the period mps, i.e., to make the period robust to parameter fluctuations, ρ should not be close to one. eq  also shows the feedback loop length n is important. the following section explains how the period mps depends on the feedback loop length.

effect of changes in feedback loop length on period and its mps
assuming ρi= <dig>  , eq  and eq  reduce to

  τ=ln4⋅∑i=1nαi- <dig> 

  Φτ=∑i=1nαi-2∑i=1nαi- <dig> 

respectively. therefore, the value of period mps is constrained by

  1n≤Φτ≤ <dig> 

the minimal value of the period mps decreases as n increases. here, let Ψτbe the sum of all the single-parameter sensitivities of the period. then, we get an interesting relationship among the single-parameter sensitivities - in methods):

  Ψτ= ∑i=1nsαiτ+sβiτ+skiτ= ∑i=1nsαiτ=- <dig> 

note that sβiτ=skiτ= <dig> and sαiτ< <dig> when ρi= <dig> . eq  indicates that all the degradation reactions share the influence on the period. the mps given by eq  is minimized when all the degradation reactions equally share the influence , which is achieved by equating all αi. assuming αi=α, eq  and eq  further reduce to

  τ=nln4α 

  Φτ=1n 

respectively. eq  indicates that the period increases with an increase in the feedback loop length n and/or with a decrease in the decay rate constant α. eq  indicates that changes in α do not alter the mps. on the other hand, the mps decreases as n increases.

in the negative feedback oscillators, the period is given by the sum of the time delays generated by the reactions belonging to the feedback loop . as the number of the reactions increases , the time delays can be distributed to more reactions. this 'distributed-time delay' mechanism provides the oscillation period with robustness to parameter fluctuations, decreasing the mps.

in the previous paper  <cit> , we proved that the merge reactions with addition logic contribute to keeping a steady-state component concentration constant against fluctuations in kinetic parameters. the concentration mps decreases as the number of merging influx reactions increases . the period mps given by eq  resembles the concentration mps in the merge reactions. although the oscillation period and steady-state concentration are different properties, our studies suggest that the underlying mechanisms that provide robustness are common to both the cases. the oscillation period is given by the sum of time delays, and the steady-state concentration is determined by the sum of influxes.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented the analytical solutions of period, amplitude, and their associated mpss for a general model of negative feedback oscillators. we validated the analytical solutions by comparing them with numerical solutions. next, using the analytical solutions, we investigated how changes in kinetic parameters affect the period and its associated mps. ρi, the ratio of threshold value to the amplitude, was found to be an important determinant of the period mps. when ρi is close to one , mps is very large, indicating that the period is very sensitive to fluctuations in kinetic parameters. finally, we gave the first mathematical proof that long negative feedback loops make oscillations robust to parameter fluctuations by the distributed time-delay mechanism. since the analytical solutions were derived for a general model of negative feedback loops that are common structures in biological oscillators, the results presented in this paper are expected to be true for many of biological oscillators.

in circadian rhythm networks, clock proteins have multiple phosphorylation sites. it has been reported that the phosphorylation is responsible for sleep disorders  <cit>  and temperature compensation  <cit> . in the previous study, we carried out numerical simulations to predict that the multiple phosphorylations contribute to enhanced robustness of circadian rhythms  <cit> . the theoretical study in this paper strongly supports our previous result. the multiple phosphorylations form a long negative feedback loop, providing the distributed time-delay mechanism. it is reasonable for organisms to devise the multiple phosphorylation sites in order to make circadian cycles robust.

to date synthetic biologists have focused on whether their artificial gene regulatory circuits oscillate  <cit> . their next challenge would be to design oscillator circuits with desired and accurate period. our study demonstrates key factors for designing such a high-performance clock. for instance, ρi  should not be close to one to make the period insensitive to parameter fluctuations -). when ρi= <dig> , the period becomes robust to parameter fluctuations. the robustness can be further increased by lengthening a feedback loop. to design an oscillator with long period, one can employ a long negative feedback loop  and/or slow decay rates  as suggested by eq . our analytical study recommends increasing the feedback loop length instead of decreasing decay rates, achieving a robust oscillator - and eq ). in summary, the analytical solutions presented in this paper greatly contribute to designing robust gene oscillators with desired period.
