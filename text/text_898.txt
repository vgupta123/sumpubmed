BACKGROUND
the vertebrate craniofacial skeleton is comprised of a complex array of cartilaginous and bony elements that must develop properly to enable efficient respiration, vocalization, and feeding. skeletal structures of the face are derived from cranial neural crest  cells that develop at the interface of the presumptive epidermis and the neural tube, and migrate to form the pharyngeal arches, establishing progenitor populations of skeletogenic cells in the head  <cit> . disruption of cnc cell behavior, or defects in cnc-derived tissue patterning, as might arise when function of a developmental regulatory gene is lost, can result in craniofacial disorders such as cleft palate, one of the most common birth defects in humans  <cit> . here we examine function of a gene important for palatogenesis, hdac <dig> 

hdac <dig> is a class ii histone deacetylase that by binds to other hdacs and myocyte enhancing factor- <dig>  to inhibit transcription factor binding to target dna  <cit> . in humans, single-nucleotide polymorphisms  in hdac <dig> are associated with non-syndromic oral clefts  <cit> , and haploinsufficiency of hdac <dig> causes brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome   with associated craniofacial abnormalities  <cit> . the mechanism by which loss of hdac <dig> causes cleft palatal disorder in humans is unknown. in mice, hdac <dig> is expressed in a number of cell types including chondrocytes, and has a critical role in regulating endochondral ossification  <cit> . establishing the function of hdac <dig> in craniofacial development is critical for understanding how disruption of this gene causes craniofacial skeletal defects.

zebrafish provide a useful model for learning about craniofacial development, including understanding of the mechanisms of morphogenesis and genetic pathways that regulate the very early stages of palatogenesis  <cit> . it has been previously shown that cnc-derived palatal precursor cells migrate both rostrally and caudally to the eye to condense on the oral ectoderm, forming the palate in both mammals and zebrafish  <cit> . in both zebrafish and mammals, the palatal skeleton initiates as paired trabeculae cranii of the cartilaginous neurocranium  <cit> . whereas mammals undergo extensive morphogenesis of the palate, including maxillary shelf formation and elevation, zebrafish eventually develop a more simplified palate, without shelves. functionally, the anterior neurocranium of the early larva zebrafish supports the roof of the mouth, and hence is similar in function to the palate in mammals.

we recently reported that a prominent clefting of the zebrafish palatal skeleton results from loss of function mutation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a , and over-expression of the microrna mir- <dig>  which regulates the function of pdgfra <cit> . disruption of both genes also results in cleft palatal defects in mice or humans  <cit>  demonstrating a shared genetic basis to palate formation among these species. particularly relevant to the hdac <dig> analyses we report here, clefting of the zebrafish palatal skeleton with loss of pdgf signaling is due to a very early cellular defect. this defect involves a failure of a subset of cnc cells, those that normally generate the medial ethmoid plate, to disperse and migrate properly to reach the oral ectoderm where they condense  <cit> .

in the present study we show that hdac <dig> is required in this same pdgfra-dependent population of cnc cells for the generation of anterior facial structures in zebrafish. transcripts of hdac <dig> are expressed in premigratory and migrating cnc cells. morpholino mediated knockdown of hdac <dig> results in an absence of anterior cnc-derived precursor cells that normally migrate medial to the eye to generate the ethmoid plate. an absence of post-migratory cnc cells along an anterior portion of oral ectoderm is subsequently associated with a shortened, clefted, or missing ethmoid plate cartilage of the palatal skeleton. since defects in hdac <dig> in humans have been associated with mid-facial deformities, including cleft palate, understanding the function of hdac <dig> in zebrafish may offer essential insights into understanding the mechanism by which this gene may normally function in the specification and/or migration of cnc cells in the development of the vertebrate face.

RESULTS
identification of hdac <dig> in zebrafish and mrna expression in the developing head
blast searches of the zebrafish genome with the human hdac <dig> protein sequence returned a single closely related sequence on chromosome  <dig> with conservation of hdac <dig> functional domains   <cit> . phylogenetic and syntenic analyses of the single zebrafish hdac <dig> gene showed that it is orthologous to one of the duplicated hdac <dig> sequences, hdac4a, present in several other teleosts, and orthologous to human hdac <dig> . analysis with microinspector  <cit>  of the complete sequence of hdac <dig> identifies two potential targets for the microrna mir-140: one target inside exon- <dig>  and another target spanning the end of exon- <dig> and beginning of exon- <dig> , of interest because of previous work showing a role of this microrna in palatal patterning  <cit> .

rt-pcr of whole embryos revealed mrna expression of hdac <dig> as early as  <dig> hpf, continuing until at least  <dig> dpf . whole-mount mrna in situ hybridization showed hdac <dig> expression in the head at  <dig> hpf  . in particular, hdac <dig> expression appeared strong in regions posterior and dorsal to the forming eye , closely matching expression of pdgfra, a marker of migrating cnc cells . the overlapping expression of hdac <dig> and pdgfra  suggests that hdac <dig> is expressed in migrating cnc. at  <dig> hpf, the overlap of expression between hdac <dig> and pdgfra was more apparent , with expression of both genes dorsal to the eye, medial to the eye, and posterior to the eye. mrna transcript of hdac <dig> is broadly expressed throughout the head after  <dig> hpf, until about  <dig> hpf, when expression becomes localized to sox9-expressing cartilages in the pharyngeal arches , mesenchyme surrounding the cartilages, and the pectoral fin . at this same stage, hdac <dig> is also expressed in the trabeculae and ethmoid plate .

mo-knockdown of hdac <dig> results in facial shortening and loss of palatal cartilage
co-injection of splice-blocking morpholinos, mo <dig> and mo <dig> , resulted in more complete protein knockdown than either mo alone . at  <dig> hpf, almost no hdac <dig> protein was detected in mo-injected embryos compared with uninjected controls . by  <dig> dpf , protein loss was still apparent, although some expression was detected in mo-injected larvae . mo-injected embryos and larvae had a distinctive facial shortening compared with uninjected controls . skeletal preparations showed variable defects in palatal cartilage, predominantly including a shortening, narrowing, and loss of cartilage in the ethmoid plate or trabeculae communis . other palatal defects ranged from notches and holes in the ethmoid plate , shortening of the trabeculae and ethmoid plate , to clefting of the palatal skeleton . in contrast, the parachordal cartilage of the posterior neurocranium was relatively unaffected . injection of a third splice-blocking mo or a translation-blocking mo generated a spectrum of palatal skeletal defects comparable with mo <dig> and mo <dig> injections . injection of mo targeting hdac <dig> also resulted in cartilage and bone defects in the pharyngeal arches, which we are currently examining, and which may be unrelated to the palatal defects. pharyngeal arch defects in mo-injected larvae include a gap in the hyosymplectic cartilage, and a stick-like opercle bone, which normally forms a fan-like shape .

over-expression of hdac <dig> mrna rescues palatal skeleton defects associated with mo-injection and causes severe midline craniofacial defects
injection of hdac <dig> mrna results in a phenotype in which midline patterning of the skeleton is impaired . this skeletal phenotype is accompanied by cyclopia. the palatal skeleton is reduced to a single cartilage rod present in the midline . this palatal defect, as well as cyclopia, in injected larvae matches the phenotypes of midline patterning mutants that act during or shortly after gastrulation  <cit> , hence suggesting that hdac <dig> over-expression is also affecting patterning at the same very early stages.

embryos were co-injected with hdac <dig> mrna and mos to attempt rescue of the hdac <dig> mo phenotype, and test the mo specificity. injection of hdac <dig> mrna along with hdac <dig> mo resulted in hdac <dig> protein levels at  <dig> hpf that were similar to levels detected in uninjected embryos – less than mrna injection alone, and more than mo-injection alone . apparent differences in levels of hdac <dig> protein expression in mo-injected embryos compared with uninjected embryos  are due to the inherent variability between western blots performed on different days. therefore, comparisons should be made within, not between these experiments.

in  <dig> dpf larvae, we still observed the spectrum of palatal skeletal defects characteristic of mo-only injection , but these defects occurred at lower incidence as compared with mo-only injection , suggesting that we obtained partial rescue of the mo phenotype. co-injection of hdac <dig> splice-blocking mo with mrna had no effect on the incidence of the over-expression phenotype induced by the full-length mrna . this finding was expected since the splice-blocking mo would have no effect on spliced mrna.

a migratory cranial neural crest cell population medial to the eye is severely reduced in hdac <dig> mo-injected embryos
the palatal skeletal defects resulting from hdac <dig> mo-injection are similar to the defects observed in pdgrfra mutants  <cit> . in the pdgfra mutant, development of the palatal skeleton is disrupted due to a defect of migration of a subset of cnc cells  <cit> . resemblance of the hdac <dig> palatal skeletal phenotype with that of the pdgfra mutant motivates the hypothesis that loss of hdac <dig> also results in disruption of cnc migration. to test this hypothesis, we first examined expression of pdgfra itself, an excellent marker of the early cnc  <cit> . we observed that at the stage of migration, at  <dig> hpf, pdgfra expression appeared diminished in mo-injected embryos in a small region where cells normally are migrating medial to the eye . this reduction was specific, for we did not detect differences in pdgfra expression dorsal or posterior to the eye . in contrast, when migration is normally just beginning at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, we observed no differences in pdgfra expression between mo-injected embryos and uninjected controls, . expression of the ligand pdgfaa at  <dig> hpf  and  <dig> hpf  appeared normal in the optic-stalk of mo-injected embryos, suggesting that the ligand for pdgfra-expressing cnc cells is not lost with knockdown of hdac <dig> <cit> . seemingly normal pdgfaa expression in mo-injected embryos suggests that at least one key feature of the environment into which cnc cells migrate may not be affected by knockdown of hdac <dig>  and furthermore that the defect originates within the specific population of cnc cells that migrate medial to the eye.

sonic hedgehog  is another factor necessary for establishing the environment for palatogenesis in zebrafish  <cit> . mrna expression of shh was not altered in hdac4-mo injected embryos, at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, when cells are migrating from the progenitor pool, and at  <dig> hpf, when cells are at the antero-ventral margin of the head .

we used live in vivo imaging with the sox10:egfp transgene, which is expressed by cnc  <cit> , to learn whether the loss of expression of pdgfra was due to specific pdgfra down-regulation, or alternatively, to an absence of the cnc population normally migrating medial to the eye. our findings strongly support the latter interpretation. by  <dig> hpf, cnc cells in control embryos migrate medial to the eye in a wedge-like pattern along the long axis of the eye, and toward the ventral and anterior margin of the eye . however, in mo-injected embryos, few or no cells had migrated medial to the eye at  <dig> hpf . to test whether the reduction or absence of cells medial to the eye in mo-injected fish was due to delayed migration, embryos were imaged up to  <dig> hpf, and results showed no recovery of cell populations medial to the eye even at older stages . matching the pdgfra in situ results, we observed no changes in distribution of premigratory cnc expressing the transgene in mo-injected embryos and controls at  <dig> hpf , or at  <dig> hpf, when cnc cells first migrate medial to the eye .

to quantify reduced or absent anterior-ward cnc cell migration and the specificity of this defect, we measured the maximum length of the migratory trajectories both medial to, and dorsal to the eye, as shown in figure 5e. in both  <dig> and  <dig> hpf embryos, the absolute distance from the posterior region of the eye to the frontier of neural crest cells medial to the eye in mo-injected fish was significantly shorter than in uninjected controls . in  <dig> hpf embryos, the absolute distance to the frontier of neural crest cells dorsal to the eye was significantly longer in uninjected controls compared to the distance in mo-injected fish . however, at  <dig> hpf, there was no significant difference in the distance of cells dorsal to the eye between mo-injected embryos and uninjected controls, suggesting that by  <dig> hpf, the migration of cells dorsal to the eye in injected embryos is normal , whereas migration medial to the eye remained severely impaired. such a specific defect is supported by comparing medial to the eye versus dorsal to the eye ratios: this normalized comparison of medial vs. dorsal cell migration was not significantly different when comparing mo-injected and uninjected embryos at  <dig> hpf but became significant by  <dig> hpf .

to address whether cell death may have caused reduction or absence of a particular subset of migratory cells we performed acridine orange  staining of mo-injected and uninjected embryos at  <dig> hpf  and  <dig> hpf . compared with uninjected controls, mo-injected embryos did not show any localized increase in labeled degenerating cells in regions of the head populated by cnc cells fated to migrate medial to the eye and subsequently form the ethmoid plate . we note that mo-injected embryos had overall higher levels of ao staining throughout the head compared to uninjected controls, likely due to non-specific effects of the morpholino.

reduction or absence of cnc cells in hdac <dig> mo-injected embryos explains the later palatal skeletal defects
the population of cells in hdac-mo injected embryos that is reduced or absent is the same population of cells fate-mapped to generate the medial ethmoid plate  <cit> . hence, no other later-acting role of hdac <dig> need be postulated to explain the ethmoid plate defects. both the early and late phenotypes of reduced or missing cnc cells and palatal defects are variable, and if our interpretation is correct, then the severities of the early and late phenotypes should co-vary. to examine this prediction, we scored the hdac <dig> mo-induced disruption of post-migratory medial ethmoid progenitors located ventral and anterior to the eye, where they are associated with oral ectoderm  <cit>  in live sox10:egfp and fli1:egfp transgenic embryos at  <dig> hpf, and then scored palatal skeletal defects in these same fish at  <dig> dpf . we observed, as predicted, that in all cases  when gfp-positive cells condensing on the oral ectoderm were not detected at  <dig> hpf , cartilage defects were evident at  <dig> dpf . in cases where gfp-positive cells appeared to condense normally on the oral ectoderm at  <dig> hpf in mo-injected embryos , the palatal skeleton appeared normal at  <dig> dpf.

examining a cross-sectional series of stages of palatal skeletal development of hdac <dig> mo-injected embryos expressing the zc81tg transgene also supports our interpretation that missing cnc progenitor cells might explain the observed palatal defects . this transgene exquisitely and specifically labels the developing cartilages, beginning around  <dig> hpf and continuing for days . at each of the stages we examined, at 6 hr intervals between  <dig> hpf and about  <dig> hpf, the trabecular cartilages of mo-injected embryos appear reduced in size, consistent with being due to a secondary effect of missing early cnc precursor cells . furthermore, beginning at about  <dig> hpf the medial ethmoid region begins to fill in with labeled cells in uninjected controls , but not completely in injected embryos . lack of cartilage at the medial ethmoid region is a feature that persists in mo-injected embryos, resulting in holes or clefts in the ethmoid plate .

discussion
the palatal skeleton of the larval zebrafish is a useful model for studying genes involved in early palatogenesis in all vertebrates, including humans  <cit> . here we provide evidence for a critical role of hdac <dig> in a migratory or premigratory anterior population of cnc cells, the cells that eventually generate the palatal skeleton. reduction of hdac <dig> function results in embryos and larvae with shortened faces and skeletal reduction and/or clefting. because loss of hdac <dig> is associated with craniofacial defects that include oral clefts in humans  <cit> , understanding the role of hdac <dig> function in zebrafish palatal skeleton development is likely relevant to understanding the function of hdac <dig> in human palatal development. in particular, based on our findings in zebrafish, one could well suppose that very early perturbation of cnc development could also underlie the human palatal defects.

defects of the palatal skeletal cartilages in hdac4-mo injected embryos result secondarily from early disruption of migratory or premigratory cnc cells
during normal development, the anteriorly-located cnc cells migrate in streams located posterior, medial, and dorsal to the eye, the medial cells eventually accumulating at the optic stalk at 20– <dig> hpf, before going on to form the medial region of the ethmoid plate, the skeletal region affected most in our hdac <dig> mo-injected embryos  <cit> . we find that at  <dig> hpf, hdac <dig> mo-injected embryos showed either a complete absence of, or significantly fewer, cnc cells migrating medial to the eye compared to uninjected controls. there is no evidence that the cells are present, and then disappear, and it remains unclear if cells are lacking in the pre-migratory cnc pool posterior to the eye, which includes other skeletal precursor cells , or if cells simply fail to migrate. all subsequent cartilaginous defects likely result from the reduction or absence of this early population of progenitor cells: in  <dig> hpf hdac <dig> mo-injected fish, as expected from the early defect, post-migratory cnc cell populations were greatly reduced in the region of the anterior oral ectoderm, and by  <dig> dpf these same fish displayed defects in the palatal skeleton itself.

in mouse, loss of hdac <dig> causes no apparent loss of chondrocytes, but premature chondrocyte hypertrophy, resulting in early onset ossification of cartilage  <cit> . in zebrafish, we observe an early absence of specific cnc cells corresponding to a later loss of chondrocytes in the ethmoid plate region of the palate, strongly arguing that the origin of the defect in zebrafish is due to missing cells and not a defect in cartilage matrix production. reduction or absence of post-migratory cnc cells in the anterior-most region of the forming palatal skeleton of hdac <dig> mo-injected embryos at  <dig> hpf is consistent with our proposal that the developmental defect occurs during the migratory or premigratory stages. we also observed hdac <dig> transcripts in the chondrocytes of the ethmoid plate  at  <dig> hpf. the earlier requirement in the cnc itself, however, is sufficient to fully explain the palatal defects we observed. we also note that whereas the palatal defects are the most prominent ones observed, it is unlikely that this is the only deficiency. for example, mo-injected fish appear to have shorter faces overall, suggesting additional roles for hdac <dig> in facial patterning.

whereas we find that loss of hdac <dig> results in a cnc defect as early as  <dig> hpf, there are several possibilities as to what the exact defect may be. as with loss of function of pdgfra  <cit> , the defect seems specific, or nearly so, for cells which normally migrate in a pathway medial to the eye. hence one interpretation of our finding is these cnc cells lack the ability to recognize chemotactic or other cues that mark this pathway selectively. alternatively, the defect could be further upstream, and result in the cell subset being improperly specified, or to be missing due to cell death. ao staining suggests that death of this specific migratory cnc cell population, or perhaps death of pre-migratory cells, is an unlikely mechanism causing the absence of cells.

further work will be required to resolve this issue; at present critical markers labeling specific subsets of cnc cells are not available. the presence of some cells medial to the eye in our hdac <dig> mo-injected embryos suggests that cnc cells are capable of migrating correctly. however, their presence might well be due to the fact that our mos do not knock down hdac <dig> completely. if so, then a model with complete loss of hdac <dig> function should result in absence of all cnc cells medial to the eye, and more severe palatal skeletal defects than we observed.

gene targets of hdac <dig> involved in craniofacial development
the gene targets of hdac <dig> required in the cnc are unknown. although established for cnc cell migration in the formation of the palatal skeleton  <cit> , based on the results of this analysis, pdgfra and pdgfaa are not direct transcriptional targets of hdac <dig> repression. future investigation, by transcriptional screening or protein co-immunoprecipitation may identify targets hdac <dig> required for zebrafish palatal skeletal development. in particular, targets of cnc cell specification or migration would help elucidate the cause of the early cnc cell defect.

an established target of repression by hdac <dig> is mef2c  <cit> . loss of mef2c in mice does not appear to result in defects involving the palatal skeleton or palate  <cit> , although mice with loss of a single copy of both mef2c and the distal-less patterning genes dlx5/ <dig> suffer cleft palate  <cit> . although zebrafish mef2ca mutants have no palatal defects , research is currently underway to understand the relationship between hdac <dig> and mef2c genes , in combination with dlx genes in craniofacial development. loss of mef2ca and dlx genes cause other defects to the craniofacial skeleton in zebrafish  <cit>  although analysis of their combined loss on palatal patterning is unknown.

in zebrafish, over-expression of the inhibitory micro-rna mir- <dig> results in palatal skeleton reduction  <cit> . mir- <dig> has also been identified as a repressor of hdac <dig> in mouse  <cit> , although eberhart et al.  did not identify any mir- <dig> binding sites in the 3′-utr of zebrafish hdac <dig>  recent studies have challenged conventional wisdom that micrornas only bind to the 3′utr of genes by showing that micrornas can also function by binding to targets in the coding sequence of genes  <cit> . although two potential targets for mir- <dig> were identified for hdac <dig>  clearly, any mechanistic function of mir- <dig> inhibiting hdac <dig> requires experimental testing. if mir- <dig> has an additional function to repress hdac <dig> independent of pdgfra repression, it is possible that splice-inhibiting mo-induced down-regulation of hdac <dig> mrna by mo could result in less target for mir- <dig>  thus leading to the availability of excess of mir- <dig> that could repress other target genes, leading to palatal skeleton defects.

development of the palatal skeleton in zebrafish and the mammalian palate involves control of cnc cell migration and condensation by many of the same gene pathways, including the pdgf and shh pathways  <cit> . we have demonstrated that hdac <dig> is another important gene involved in the regulation of a subset of cnc cells that form the palatal skeleton in zebrafish. further understanding of the mechanism of hdac <dig> function, and analysis of targets of hdac <dig> activity will generate a more complete model of how hdac <dig> controls development of the palatal skeleton, and should further inform understanding of how loss of hdac <dig> in humans causes craniofacial disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
knockdown of hdac <dig> by morpholino results in the reduction or absence of a specific population of migratory cnc cells in the zebrafish head that normally contribute to the formation of the anterior palatal skeleton. reduction or absence of migratory cells, detected by  <dig> hpf, corresponds with a reduction in cnc-derived antero-ventral cells of the face by  <dig> hpf, and then reductions of ethmoid plate cartilage, evident as early as  <dig> hpf. by 6dpf, the ethmoid plate is shortened, clefted or missing. the results of this study offer insights into the mechanism of how hdac <dig> normally functions in regulating early cnc cell behavior in craniofacial skeletogenesis. since defects in hdac <dig> in humans are associated with cleft palate, understanding the function of this gene in the normal specification and migration of cnc cells may reveal how loss of hdac <dig> causes craniofacial malformations.
