BACKGROUND
studies of trichuris muris focus on one particular isolate, the edinburgh  isolate. infections of resistant mice, such as balb/c, with the e isolate results in a protective th <dig> response. susceptibility to infection is associated with the host mounting a ifn-γ-dominated response inappropriate for worm expulsion and this is seen in mouse strains such as akr  <cit> .

however, other laboratory isolates of t. muris exist, the japan  isolate, sub-cultured from the e isolate and the sobreda  isolate discovered in portugal. interestingly, these isolates provoke different immune responses within the same host  <cit> , such as the c57bl/ <dig> mouse strain. in the c57bl/ <dig> mouse the s isolate is able to survive to chronicity, whereas the other two isolate are expelled prior day  <dig> p.i  <cit> . this therefore, gives us a rare opportunity to study innate and adaptive immune responses to t. muris in the context of a resistant or susceptible outcome within one mouse strain without altering worm burden levels. the only other such model available involves manipulating egg dose to generate high or low dose infections and thus resistance  or susceptibility   <cit> . it has been previously reported that the s isolate survival, within the c57bl/ <dig> mouse, is associated with a dampened effector th <dig> response and an increased th <dig> responses  <cit> .

little is known however, about the underlying mechanisms evolved by the s isolate to enhance its survival within the host. data from our laboratory suggests that the s isolate has evolved methods of manipulating the hosts t regulatory cell arm of the immune response <cit> , and the responses of key antigen presenting cells to parasite antigens <cit> . however differences in gene expression locally in gut tissue p.i. have not been analysed, despite the fact that they may underlie subsequent infection outcome.

microarray analysis is a useful tool to look at global gene expression changes and indeed has been utilised to usefully inform research in many infections and diseases including helicobacter pylori infection  <cit>  and inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . interestingly, data already published from our laboratory has used oligonucleotide microarrays to determine gene expression changes in either resistant  or susceptible  mice infected with the e isolate of t. muris at  <dig> or  <dig> days post infection . results indicated that akr mice had a th1- dominated mucosa, with up-regulated expression of genes associated with ifn-γ and balb/c mice up-regulated the expression of genes coding for potential anti-parasitic proteins including intelectin and angiogenins  <cit> . the association of ifn-γ with susceptibility during a t. muris infection has also been shown via reverse transcription -pcr analyses  <cit>  and its functional importance revealed by blocking studies  <cit> .

here we analyse gut tissue, from c57bl/ <dig> mice infected with either the e isolate or the s isolate. a time point of  <dig> days p.i was chosen, as it is a time point where the host will not have expelled either of the isolates , yet early gene expression changes may be occurring which later determine whether the parasite is expelled or not. data presented here highlights the possible importance of two genes in particular, indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase  and angiogenin  <dig> . indo is a gene whose expression is up-regulated by both isolates and may aid early survival within the host. ang <dig> is a gene whose expression is differentially regulated by the two isolates and may determine outcome of infection within the c57bl/ <dig> host. further, histological analysis of goblet cells demonstrated differences in their mucin content p.i with the e or s isolates of t. muris. changes in ang <dig> expression and/or other genes described here may explain the alterations of mucin acidity within the goblet cell and these changes may contribute to s isolate survival within the c57bl/ <dig> host.

RESULTS
enhanced survival of the s isolate of t. muris compared to the e isolate in c57bl/ <dig> mice
as previously reported  <cit> , the s isolate of t. muris is able to persist for longer and indeed reach fecundity in a c57bl/ <dig> mouse unlike the e isolate of t. muris. as shown in fig.  <dig>  worm expulsion is clearly evident at d <dig> p.i in an e isolate infection with only two mice harbouring high number of worms. in contrast, all five mice infected with the s isolate have high numbers of worms at d <dig> p.i and still have worms present at d <dig> p.i where as, at this time point, all five c57bl/ <dig> mice have expelled the e isolate .

commonality and differences in rna expression profiles following infection with the e or s isolates of t. muris
mice infected with either the e or s isolates of t. muris were sacrificed at d <dig> p.i. microarray analysis was carried out at this time point, prior to expulsion of either isolates to identify changes in gene expression which might reflect the early immune interactions which underlie the subsequent differences in survival. microarray data from rna extracted from three gut samples , done in triplicate, was analysed by the puma bayesian statistical method  <cit> . the probability of positive log-ratio  statistical scores were generated for each probe set by two-way comparisons between the three sample groups. pplr values range from  <dig> to  <dig>  with values closest to  <dig> representing the most significantly down-regulated probe sets and values closest to  <dig>  representing the most significantly up-regulated probe sets. values of  <dig>  represent no significant change  <cit> . venn diagrams were generated to show the distribution of the probe sets. probe sets with a probability of positive log-ratio  value greater than  <dig>   in at least one of the comparisons  indicate that  <dig> probe sets are uniquely up-regulated when comparing the gene expression profile of gut tissue from a naïve mouse to the gene expression profile of gut tissue from an e isolate-infected mouse . when comparing svn,  <dig> probe sets are unique, interestingly however,  <dig> probe sets are up-regulated in both an e isolate infection and an s isolate infection. importantly there were  <dig> probe sets that were uniquely up-regulated when comparing the gene expression profiles of gut tissue taken from mice infected with the two isolates - sve . the number of probe sets associated with a significantly down-regulated pplr value  was higher than the number for up-regulated probe sets.  <dig> probe sets alone were significantly down-regulated in an s isolate infection compared to an e isolate infection- sve .

combining probe sets that were either significantly up-regulated  or significantly down-regulated  in at least one of the comparisons  generated a list of  <dig> probe sets.  <dig> of these probe sets were unique to sve . a total of  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in gut tissue p.i with the more commonly studied e isolate compared to an uninfected  mouse . only  <dig> genes, however, were common in all three comparisons  . examples of the  <dig> probe sets are shown in table  <dig>  with the table split into sections representing the segments shown in fig. 2e .

a scatter plot was generated to show the general profile of the microarray data set. log fold change is shown for s isolate infection over naïve  vs. log fold change of e isolate infection over naïve . the majority of probe sets fit within the centre quadrant, representing probe sets with small changes between the isolates. the four quadrants on the extremities of the scatter plot identify the probe sets that may be of interest, i.e. up or down in both the e isolate-infected gut and the s isolate-infected gut compared to naive or up in one isolate infection and down in the other isolate compared to naïve .

microarray probe sets associated with immune response respond similarly in the gut of an s isolate-infected mouse to an un-infected  mouse
the  <dig> probe sets that had a pplr value greater than  <dig>  or less than  <dig>  in at least one of the comparisons  underwent clustering analysis . six distinct clusters were generated and probe sets from each cluster were subjected to expression analysis systematic explorer  online tool and david  <cit> . for each cluster, overrepresented gene ontology  groups were identified .

cluster a contained  <dig> probe sets associated with mating behaviour but respond in a similar pattern for both an e isolate infection and an s isolate infection. in cluster b, the s isolate down-regulates  <dig> probe sets associated with cell cycle and cytoskeletal organisation compared to naïve and e isolate probe sets. in cluster c, containing  <dig> probe sets, the s isolates expression levels in the gut are similar to naïve levels, whereas the e isolate over express these probe sets. interestingly, these  <dig> probe sets are associated with go groups for immune response, defence response, antigen presentation and response to stress. in cluster d, the s isolate infection causes an increase in gene expression for probe sets associated with growth regulation but down-regulates genes associated with muscle development in cluster e. in both clusters d and e, the e isolate and naïve samples are responding similarly. the final cluster, f, shows no change in naïve levels, a down-regulation with an e isolate infection and an up regulation with the s isolate. these  <dig> probe sets were associated with potassium ion transport . cluster c is expanded and shown in detail in fig. 3c. genes include angiogenin  <dig> , indoleamine-pyrrole  <dig>  dioxygenase , chemokine ligand  <dig>  and interferon inducible gtpase  <dig> .

confirmation of genes from cluster c; angiogenin  <dig> and indoleamine-pyrrole  <dig>  dioxygenase
given that we had previously demonstrated a correlation between ang <dig> expression and resistance and indo expression and susceptibility in a study using different strains of mouse infected with the e isolate  <cit>  we selected these two genes to corroborate our microarray data by qpcr and immunohistochemistry.

indo was a highly expressed gene for both e and s isolate compared to naïve . however when comparing sve the pplr value implied that the e isolate transcribed more indo than the s isolate . these findings were confirmed by qpcr on rna extracted from the gut and the epithelial cell fraction  .

although qpcr revealed a non-significant elevation in indo in the gut and epithelial cell fraction of mice infected with the e isolate compared to the s isolate, analysis of ido at the protein level revealed significantly higher numbers of positive staining cells in an e isolate infection. thus, infection with either isolate resulted in significantly increased levels of ido+ cells compared to naïve , with the e isolate infection provoking higher numbers compared to infection with the s isolate  .

by microarray, gene expression of ang <dig> was higher in the gut of mice infected with the e isolate compared to the levels seen in the gut of s isolate-infected c57bl/ <dig> mice . ang <dig> expression was also elevated in whole gut and epithelial cell fractions derived from e-infected mice compared to s-infected mice as identified by qpcr . further, immunohistochemical staining revealed significantly more ang4+ cells at day  <dig> p.i. in e isolate-infected mice .

increased numbers and acidity of goblet cells in c57bl/ <dig> mice infected with the e isolate compared to the s isolate of t. muris
quantification of ang <dig> expression has previously focused on small intestinal paneth cells as the cellular source  <cit> . fig. 4d shows higher expression of ang <dig> in the epithelial cell fraction and in fig. 4f this expression can clearly be seen to localise to the goblet cell suggesting that as no paneth cells are present in the large intestine, the goblet cell is the most likely source.

therefore, goblet cell staining was carried out on proximal colon sections from naïve, e isolate-infected and s isolate-infected c57bl/ <dig> mice. total numbers of goblet cells per  <dig> colonic crypt units  is shown throughout an infection time course . at day  <dig> p.i an e isolate-infected mice had significantly higher number of goblet cells compared to mice infected with the s isolate . following infection with either the e or s isolate total numbers of goblet cells increased steadily over the full time course from naïve levels.

an interesting phenotypical change in the acidity of mucins was within the goblet cells was evident between the infections with the different isolates. at d <dig> p.i mice infected with the s isolate of t. muris had significantly higher numbers of goblet cells containing neutral  mucins compared to mice infected with the e isolate  . when these values are converted to percentages of total goblet cell numbers, the pattern is exaggerated at d <dig> and d <dig> p.i . examples of typical sections from mice harbouring either the e isolate or s isolate, stained for goblet cells, taken on d <dig> p.i are shown in fig. 5d at two magnifications  clearly highlight the acidic mucin differences in the goblet cells.

acidity and/or neutrality of goblet cells are determined by the addition or removal of sugars on mucins by transferases. increased transferase function would cause increased acidity of mucins within the goblet cells. table  <dig> indicates possible transferases that could be causing the phenotypical changes of the goblet cell mucins seen between the two isolates at d <dig> p.i from the whole gut microarray analyses. thus, analyses of gene expression levels in whole gut tissue from s and e infected mice reveals a down regulation of all four transferases in tissue from mice infected with the s isolate compared to the e isolate.

pplr values for all three comparisons  and fold change in gene expression levels of probe sets from the gut of an s isolate-infected mouse compared to expression levels in an e isolate-infected gut are shown along with probe set identification  number, gene symbol and gene description.

discussion
the intimate interactions between hosts and parasites have been studied for many years  <cit> . the ability of helminths, in particular t. muris to affect the immune environment within the host has a broad associated literature  <cit> . genome wide approaches to understand the changes occurring in the host at a gene expression level have been utilised in many infectious models and diseases  <cit> . indeed microarray and rt-pcr analysis have been used to explore the responses of mouse strains infected with t. muris  <cit> . however, these experiments use different mouse strains in order to compare the gene expression profiles associated with resistance or susceptibility. here we use one mouse strain, c57bl/ <dig>  and different t. muris isolates to achieve susceptibility or resistant outcomes. in addition we look early in infection to identify changes in gene expression, that could later determine susceptibility or resistance of the host.

we demonstrate that the s isolate of t. muris, which is able to persist chronically in a c57bl/ <dig> host, provokes a different gene expression profile in gut tissue compared to a c57bl/ <dig> mouse infected with the e isolate, which is ultimately expelled. these changes are already apparent by d <dig> p.i. prior to e isolate expulsion. in particular, differences in  <dig> probe sets associated with go groups - immune response, defence response, antigen presentation and response to stress were identified.

interestingly the expression of genes from an s isolate infected gut resemble those seen in a naïve  gut, whereas there was an elevation in the expression of the genes represented by the  <dig> probe sets during an e isolate infection. this data would imply that even at d <dig> p.i., the s isolate is dampening down expression of genes that would normally be associated with expulsion of the parasite. microarray analyses on gut tissue from different strains of mice infected with the e isolate had previously identified differences in the expression of indo and ang <dig>  as these two genes were also identified as being differentially expressed in this current study we investigated their expression further.

indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase plays an important part in the kynurenine pathway where it metabolises tryptophan which has been associated with controlling parasite growth in a number of infections  <cit> . ido also has immunoregulatory roles  <cit> , indeed its ability to dampen cell proliferation  <cit>  may extend to the control of gut epithelial cell turnover and thus delayed or absent worm expulsion given the importance of epithelial cell turnover in the expulsion of t. muris  <cit> . as the expression of ido was elevated in gut tissue from both e and s isolate-infected mice its presence may reflect a less efficient ability, rather than a complete inability, to expel the parasite.

in contrast, ang <dig> expression did differentiate between worm survival and expulsion with expression levels only elevated in e-infected mice. the angiogenins are a family of closely related proteins described as paneth cell-derived and encoded for, in the mouse, by a gene cluster on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . they belong to the rnase superfamily  <cit>  which includes eosinophil secretory granules proteins which are toxic to some gastrointestinal nematodes  <cit> . originally implicated in the growth of tumours, the normal physiological role of the angiogenins was unclear until the demonstration of a role for paneth cell derived ang <dig> as an endogenous anti-microbial protein central in epithelial host defence against gut-dwelling bacteria  <cit> . immunohistochemical staining of gut tissue in this study localised ang <dig> production to the goblet cell, identifying the cell type as a novel cellular source in the large intestine. this interesting discovery expands on the already extensive literature on the importance of goblet cells in the expulsion of nematode infection, where increased numbers of goblet cells correlate with resistance  <cit> .

a goblet cell hyperplasia is reported in the context of many nematode infections including t. muris, t. spiralis, h. polygyrus and n. brasiliensis and this is thought to be under the control of a th <dig> response  <cit> . several goblet cell factors have been identified to play an important role in nematode infection including relm-β and muc <dig>  relm-β expression is linked with the production of th <dig> cytokines and worm expulsion in t. muris, t. spiralis and n. brasiliensis  <cit> . thus effective worm expulsion may be achieved through combined effects of antimicrobial proteins including the angiogenins, relm-β and indeed the intelectins  <cit> .

goblet cell numbers did not differ quantitatively between e and s isolate infection until d <dig> p.i. however, the goblet cells were qualitatively strikingly different at d <dig> p.i. thus the number of neutral goblet cells present in the gut of an s isolate infected c57bl/ <dig> mouse are significantly higher than that seen in an e isolate infected mouse. by d <dig> the number of neutral goblet cells is similar for both isolates, if not higher in the e isolate infection. at this time point the majority of e isolate worms have been expelled.

the acidity of goblet cells is determined by the addition and removal of sugars to the mucins within the goblet cell  <cit> . transferases are required to do this and table  <dig> highlights candidate transferases that may explain the differences seen in the quality of the goblet cells. increased gene expression of the transferases is seen in the microarray data in the gut of an e isolate-infected mouse compared to an s isolate-infected gut. the increases in gene expression of the transferases listed could explain the increased acidity of the goblet cell mucins seen in an e isolate infection and may even underlie subsequent expulsion.

CONCLUSIONS
the c57bl/ <dig> mouse strain differs in its ability to expel the e and s isolates of t. muris. microarray analysis of gut tissue taken from infected mice just one week p.i. revealed significant differences in gene expression profiles. thus, under similar levels of parasite exposure in a single mouse strain changes which ultimately correlate with resistance or susceptibility are apparent.

we report an association between the expression of the anti-microbial protein ang <dig> and resistance to infection and further identify the goblet cell as a novel cellular source. qualitative differences in goblet cell mucins early p.i. are also reported and may act as an early predictor of future resistance or susceptibility.
