BACKGROUND
a small number of global regulatory proteins appear to play a central role in integrating the regulatory architecture of escherichia coli, so as to promote coherent transcriptional responses to environmental changes. just seven proteins  directly control expression of about half of all genes in e. coli  <cit> . we report here direct evidence that three of these seven proteins, plus a more specific regulator, cooperate to control an operon critical to nitrogen metabolism.

there are two main pathways for assimilating ammonia into glutamate in escherichia coli  <cit>  . in the presence of high ammonia concentrations and limited carbon/energy, glutamate dehydrogenase  produces glutamate from ammonia, α-ketoglutarate, and nadph .

nh4+ + α-ketoglutarate + nadph → glutamate + nadp+      <cit> 

at low ammonia concentrations, a two-enzyme cycle is used instead. first, glutamine synthetase  produces glutamine from ammonia, glutamate and atp . then glutamate synthase  produces two molecules of glutamate from glutamine, α-ketoglutarate, and nadph , with one of the glutamate molecules going back into the cycle and the other representing net ammonia incorporation . the only difference between equations  <cit>  and  <cit>  is the involvement of atp.

nh4+ + glutamate + atp → glutamine + adp + pi      <cit> 

glutamine + α-ketoglutarate + nadph →  <dig> glutamate + nadp+      <cit> 

nh4+ + α-ketoglutarate + nadph + atp → glutamate + nadp+ + adp + pi    <cit> 

in the presence of high ammonia levels, gltbd activity would waste atp as a result of unnecessary glutamine turnover. the pathway represented by equation  <dig> is estimated to account for a remarkable 15% of total atp turnover during growth in glucose minimal medium  <cit> , so the atp wastage would be substantial. however, insufficient gltbd activity in the face of dropping ammonia levels would lead to cessation of growth  <cit>  and a competitive disadvantage. clearly the level of gltbd must be very carefully controlled so as to anticipate the probable near-term needs of the cell.

our interest in gltbdf, the operon that includes structural genes for gltbd, stems from its membership in the regulon controlled by lrp   <cit> . there is no obvious single role for lrp, but three broad themes stand out. first, lrp appears to sense the shift between two major e. coli environments, "the gut and the gutter"  <cit> , activating many amino acid biosynthetic operons  and repressing many catabolic ones. second, and partially overlapping the first, lrp plays an important role in regulating nitrogen metabolism  <cit> . third, lrp appears to play an important role in preparing the cell for stationary phase  <cit> .

in the gltbdf operon, ihf binds the region from - <dig> to - <dig>  while the three lrp binding sites are centered at nucleotides - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the transcription start site  <cit>  . this arrangement leaves space for other proteins to bind, and it seemed likely that additional regulators would be involved in controlling a pathway that can account for 15% of the cell's atp flux. there is some evidence for effects  of other regulators on gltbdf expression, including crp  <cit> , fnr  <cit> , nac  <cit> , and gade  <cit>  . we report here that gltbdf is directly and negatively controlled by crp and argr, in addition to the direct positive control by lrp and ihf. we also show that rnap binds stably to the gltbdf promoter in the presence of lrp and ihf, or in the presence of crp-camp.

RESULTS
effects of lrp and ihf on rnap binding to the gltbdf promoter region
we have previously shown that lrp and ihf bind simultaneously to gltbdf promoter  dna, yielding a band with intermediate gel shift mobility between the ihf-dna and lrp-dna complexes . fig. 3a shows that the lrp-binding region yields a subtly altered lrp-dependent dnase i footprint in the presence of ihf, though the ihf footprint is not obviously changed by the presence of lrp.

rna polymerase holoenzyme  binds to pgltb in the absence of other proteins, as revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift of a dna segment from - <dig> to + <dig> . however dnase i footprinting analysis of this binary complex revealed no obvious regions of protection . since the absence of either lrp or ihf leads to a >30-fold reduction in gltbdf transcription  <cit> , we investigated whether these two proteins influence rnap binding to pgltb. mobility shift experiments were not informative as, under our conditions, the large shift due to rnap alone was indistinguishable from shifts due to rnap together with lrp and/or ihf. however dnase i protection analysis revealed that the combination of lrp, ihf and rnap results in a footprint in the promoter region, with strongly enhanced cleavage at the - <dig> position of the template strand and protection in the remainder of the region between the - <dig> and - <dig> hexamers . this protection extended ~ <dig> bp upstream of the - <dig> hexamer, merging with the footprint of ihf, and some protection was visible even farther upstream between the ihf and lrp binding sites. a combination of just lrp and ihf does not result in any additional footprint aside from those of the individual proteins  <cit> , and in particular the extended protection upstream of the - <dig> hexamer is not seen in the absence of rnap .

crp-camp regulation of gltbdf transcription
we searched for proteins from an e. coli whole-cell extract that bound to immobilized, biotinylated pgltb dna, using ciphergen proteinchips™ and mass spectrometry. this method had previously implicated ihf as a factor involved in gltbdf regulation, as we subsequently confirmed  <cit> , but additional mass peaks representing other dna binding proteins had not yet been investigated. the analysis suggested argr  and crp  as potential additional regulators of gltbdf . several decades ago prusiner et al. reported negative regulation of glutamate synthase expression by crp  <cit> . specifically, glutamate synthase activity is doubled in a mutant lacking adenylate cyclase , and reduced  <dig> -fold by addition of exogenous camp or growth with glycerol as the carbon source   <cit> . however, it was not determined whether these results involved direct interactions between crp and pgltb.

our inspection of the gltbdf dna sequence revealed a potential crp-binding site between - <dig> and - <dig> . we have not attempted to measure transcription of a gltb-lacz fusion in isogenic crp and crp+ strains, to complement the earlier data of prusiner et al.  <cit> . this is because the crp mutant grows much more slowly than its isogenic partner  <cit> , and comparisons would be complicated by the different growth rates  <cit> . however we have taken three complementary approaches to demonstrate a direct effect of crp-camp on glt transcription.

first, we carried out mobility shift assays using purified crp and a gltbdf dna fragment containing the region from - <dig> to + <dig>  crp bound the glt dna with an apparent kd of  <dig> nm in the presence of  <dig> μm camp . replacing the region between - <dig> and - <dig> with heterologous dna  <cit>  resulted in loss of detectable binding . when camp was not added to the gel, but was present in the binding reaction, binding was still observed but the shifted bands were smeared, suggesting that the complexes were unstable under this condition .

second, we carried out dnase i footprint analyses, using purified crp, camp, and pgltb dna. a defined region of partial protection was seen between - <dig> and - <dig> on the non-template strand , and - <dig> to - <dig> on the template strand . thus crp-camp interacts directly with pgltb. the crp binding is centered at - <dig> , in the predicted binding sequence , and between the - <dig> hexamer and the ihf binding site .

third, we determined the effects of the membrane-permeable derivative dibutyryl-camp on expression of gltb-lacz with and without alteration of the crp binding sequence. the alterations are shown in fig. 5a , and replace all of the most highly-conserved nucleotides of known crp-binding sequences  that were not already different in the native gltbdf promoter. concentrations of dibutyryl-camp as high as  <dig> μm had no effect on the growth rate of the cultures , and we used  <dig> μm in the experiments described here. as a control, parental strain w <dig>  was grown in a defined glucose rich medium plus the inducer iptg. as shown in fig. 6a, dibutyryl-camp had the expected effect of increasing lacz expression in the parental strain, due to relief of catabolite repression  <cit> . in contrast, fig. 6b shows that dibutyryl-camp reduced expression of lacz fused to wt pgltb, while fig. 6c shows that dibutyryl-camp had no effect on lacz fused to pgltb having the altered crp binding sequence. similar results were obtained in glucose minimal medium .

as crp most often acts as a transcription activator, we explored some possible explanations for its repressive effect on pgltb. one possibility, given the proximity of the crp and ihf binding sites , and the requirement of ihf for activation by lrp  <cit> , is that crp interferes with ihf binding. however mobility shift analysis indicates that crp and ihf bind independently of one another , though the ternary and binary complexes could not be resolved from one another well enough to completely rule out limited negative  cooperativity in their binding.

a second possibility, which we did not test, is that the crp-induced bend in the dna  <cit>  opposes that generated by ihf, preventing proper activation. a third possibility is that crp interferes with rnap binding. as noted above, rnap alone fails to yield a clear protection pattern on pgltb dna. adding crp-camp, far from interfering with rnap binding, resulted in the appearance of a well-defined pattern of rnap-dependent protection . this pattern is, however, distinct from that seen when the coactivators lrp and ihf are added in place of crp . one particularly striking difference, as an example, is the dnase cleavage at position - <dig>  that shows hypersensitivity in the presence of lrp + ihf but not in the presence of crp .

argr-arg regulation of gltbdf transcription
the ciphergen proteinchip™ analysis referred to above yielded another e. coli polypeptide bound to pgltb dna, having a molecular mass close to that of the regulatory protein argr . the involvement of argr in gltbdf regulation is reinforced by the following three observations. first, adding  <dig>  mm l-arginine to mops-glucose medium nearly halved lacz activity, in the gltb-lacz fusion strain lp <dig>  . second, deleting argr from strains lp <dig>  or lp <dig>  doubled lacz activity. third, adding arginine to the growth medium did not affect lacz levels in the Δargr strain lp <dig> 

we have evidence that argr mediates its regulatory effect on the gltbdf promoter via direct interaction. there are two good matches to the consensus argr binding site sequence  <cit>  upstream of the promoter-distal lrp binding site . when gltbdf dna containing the putative argr sites upstream of - <dig> was deleted, arginine had no effect on gltb-lacz expression . we extended this observation by using purified argr in mobility shift and dnase i footprint analyses. argr bound to gltb dna  with a kdapp of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm , and to a 3'-shortened fragment  with essentially the same affinity . these data were fitted using the hill equation as previously described  <cit> , and both binding curves were characterized by a hill coefficient of  <dig> , indicating that multiple argr molecules are binding cooperatively.

the sequence to which argr binds was determined by dnase i protection using gltb dna from - <dig> to + <dig>  argr protected a region upstream of the distal lrp binding site , extending from - <dig> to - <dig> on the non-template strand. this encompasses the two argr consensus-matching sites, and is consistent with the hill coefficient of  <dig> . similar results were obtained for the template strand .

we considered two possibilities for the basis of gltbdf repression by argr. first, given the proximity of the argr and lrp binding sites , we tested whether argr interfered with lrp binding. mobility shift assays with argr and lrp were inconclusive in this respect, because adding the corepressor arginine to the gel prevented the lrp-dna complex from migrating far into the gel . however dnase i footprint analyses suggest that lrp and argr bind independently of one another .

a second possible basis for repression of gltbdf by argr involves interference with the proposed lrp-rnap interaction. argr does in fact alter the protection pattern generated by the combination of lrp, ihf, and rnap . in the absence of argr there is a limited region of rnap-dependent hypersensitivity that overlaps the argr binding site; addition of argr and arginine alters this hypersensitivity pattern.

effects of rph on gltbdf expression
we considered the possibility that our measurements of gltbdf expression were being affected by a defect in the e. coli w <dig> background. this commonly-used k- <dig> strain carries a frameshift mutation in rph, the structural gene for rnaseph, that results in decreased pyre  expression and in turn leads to pyrimidine limitation during growth in minimal media  <cit> . pyrimidine biosynthesis is regulated by feedback inhibition, so it seemed plausible that w <dig> would sense increased demand for glutamate , and would thus have elevated gltbdf expression. consistent with this possibility, adding  <dig> μg/ml of the pyrimidine uracil to strain lp <dig> in minimal medium resulted in a  <dig>  fold reduction of pgltb-lacz activity . we replaced the w <dig> rph allele with the wild-type gene , and the new strain was designated lp <dig>  correcting the rph mutation roughly halved transcription from pgltb in strain lp <dig> , in agreement with the uracil addition results. strain lp <dig> may be generally useful for studies of e. coli physiology.

discussion
role of ihf in mediating activation of gltbd by lrp
ihf, a dna-bending protein  <cit> , is required for activation of gltbdf transcription by lrp  <cit> . ihf subtly affects the lrp-dependent dnase i footprint , suggesting that ihf alters the lrp-dna complex . in addition, ihf bending could bring the lrp-dna complex into activating contact with rnap at pgltb . ihf plays an architectural role at several activated promoters, such as pilvp  <cit> . we have not directly demonstrated looping, but two results support this view. first, no defined footprint for rnap was seen at pgltb with either ihf or lrp alone, only with both together . second, an earlier study demonstrated that a  <dig> bp  insertion between the proximal lrp binding site and the promoter reduced gltb-lacz expression 3-7-fold, while a  <dig> bp  insertion at the same location did not reduce fusion expression . bending or looping models do not rule out the possibility of direct rnap-ihf contacts occurring as well  <cit> .

does crp pre-position rnap in response to energy metabolism?
the flux through the glna/gltbd pathway can be quite high in minimal media. atp is required for the glna/gltbd pathway and not for the gdha pathway , and governing the relative fluxes through these alternative pathways is probably one of the most critical regulatory problems faced by e. coli. we report direct regulation of pgltb by crp, in agreement with earlier indirect evidence  <cit> . a microarray-based global analysis of e. coli genes affected by crp  <cit>  did not identify the gltbdf operon, but this probably reflects the rich culture medium  used in that work. crp is broadly associated with the control of carbon and energy source utilization, usually activating genes for utilization of less-efficient carbon/energy sources   <cit> . competitions between gdha and gdha+ strains  <cit>  reveal a clear advantage for the gdha+ strain during glucose limitation, suggesting that crp modulates the relative activities of the two alternative pathways for glutamate synthesis to favor the atp-independent pathway during growth on suboptimal carbon sources  <cit> . the reciprocal effects of carbon source and addition of camp on gdha and gltbd activities are consistent with just this role for crp  <cit> . in addition, crp-camp represses one of the promoters for the glutamine synthetase gene   <cit> , so both enzymes for the glna/gltbd pathway are controlled in parallel by crp.

our data show that crp-camp binding in vitro  is correlated with reduced transcription in vivo , and that rnap generates a protection pattern at pgltb in the presence of crp-camp  different from the pattern yielded by rnap in the presence of ihf + lrp . the crp-camp repression thus appears to alter rnap binding rather than blocking it. the crp footprint is centered at - <dig>  relative to the start of gltb transcription, close to the position from which crp activates class i promoters  <cit>  where crp binds between the c-terminal domain of rpoa  and region  <dig> of rpod . however optimal spacing from the proximal edge of the crp binding site to that of the - <dig> hexamer is 13– <dig> bp in class i promoters, while in pgltb this spacing is  <dig> bp . crp may thus repress pgltb by mispositioning or trapping rnap. repression has been seen due to mispositioning of rnap via alternative binding sites  <cit> , or trapping at the promoter  <cit> . a recent global analysis suggests that nearly a quarter of σ <dig> -dependent promoters have bound rnap that is "poised" but not transcribing  <cit> . rnap poised at pgltb would allow a rapid increase of gltbd levels in the face of falling ammonium concentrations, as the gdha reaction becomes increasingly inefficient .

role of argr in repressing gltbdf
as shown in fig.  <dig>  glutamate is a precursor of ornithine, which in turn is converted to arginine. thus regulation of gltbd in response to arginine is an example of negative feedback regulation. the relatively modest effects are appropriate given the need for glutamate in many other pathways. a similar feedback regulation of glutamate biosynthesis by argr was recently observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . the mechanism by which argr represses pgltb is not clear, but our evidence is consistent with the possibility that argr interferes with formation of the final activation complex. as shown in fig.  <dig>  and illustrated in fig.  <dig>  argr binds far upstream of the promoter, near the lrp-binding region. however argr does not appear to have a major effect on lrp binding . our working hypothesis is that argr allows pre-assembly of the lrp-ihf-rnap complex, but blocks a specific contact required for transcriptional activation. this would resemble the suggested role of crp  in reducing gltbd expression while allowing rapid return to full activation should the appropriate conditions change.

role of lrp in regulation of gltbd
lrp is not simply a signal of amino acid sufficiency. first, gltbdf is one of the operons for which lrp regulation is relatively insensitive to the coregulator leucine  <cit> . second, lrp levels  are sensitive to the alarmone ppgpp  <cit> , which in turn is affected by sufficiency of both amino acids and other nutrients  <cit> . lrp levels vary between media, and  also through the growth cycle  <cit> .

much of what is known about regulation of gdha, glna, and gltbd is consistent with the expected reciprocal pattern between the two pathways shown in fig.  <dig>  one would expect gdha levels to parallel those of , while glna and gltbd levels would perhaps follow the inverse of  and parallel those of atp. in fact, gdha is repressed by nac, with repression relieved in high , while neither glna nor gltbd appear to respond substantially to nac  <cit> . similarly, transcription of both glna and gltbd is repressed by crp-camp while effects on gdha are unclear . conversely, both glna activity  and gltbd transcription are boosted by lrp, which has no obvious effect on gdha  <cit> .

modeling analysis  <cit>  suggests that the major control of relative flux between the alternative pathways shown in fig.  <dig> should involve regulation of glna activity . lrp has major effects on glna expression and adenylylation status in response to ammonia levels  <cit> . the effect of lrp on glna expression and activity is indirect, probably involving the direct lrp effect on gltbd expression that, in turn, modulates the intracellular ratios of α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and glutamine  <cit> . this model requires changes in gene expression levels for adaptation to sudden large changes in , with gltbd needing to be expressed above a threshold level. the 30-40-fold activation of pgltb by lrp  <cit>  is consistent with a major switch above or below this critical threshold expression level. in contrast, the effects of crp and argr  are smaller, fine-tuning controls that may modulate the flow of glutamine out of the middle of the glna-gltbd pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
results from this study demonstrate that the physiologically-important gltbdf operon of e. coli is subject to negative as well as positive control, and involves a third member of the group of seven most-global transcriptional regulatory proteins. in addition to the previously-demonstrated direct positive roles of lrp and ihf, there are direct negative roles for crp and argr. lrp and ihf appear to stabilize rnap binding to the promoter, as no rnap-dependent footprint appears unless both lrp and ihf are present. crp-camp can replace lrp + ihf in potentiating footprint formation by rnap, though the resulting protection patterns are distinct. argr alters, but does not prevent, footprint formation by rnap + lrp + ihf. it does not appear that either repressor, crp or argr, acts by interfering with binding of the activators or of rnap. this study does not explore the specific mechanisms of activation or repression at gltbdf, but the results are consistent with the possibility that crp and argr inhibit transcription in such a way as to leave the rnap poised for rapid transcription initiation when conditions require it. given the central importance of the regulation of glutamate biosynthesis, reflected by the involvement of lrp and two other e. coli global regulatory proteins, it would be instructive to know whether this regulatory mechanism is broadly conserved among related bacterial species adapted to different nutritional environments.
