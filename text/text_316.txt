BACKGROUND
taste buds, the transducing elements of gustatory sensation, contain a heterogeneous population of  <dig> to  <dig> elongate taste receptor cells, which extend from the basal lamina to the surface of the epithelium. taste stimuli interact with receptors on the apical membrane, while the basolateral membranes of some taste cells associate with gustatory nerve fibers to transmit taste information to the brain.

several types of taste cells have been identified morphologically. type i cells, also known as "dark" cells, generally comprise about half of the taste bud. these cells are not believed to have a receptive function, but to play a more glial-like role in the taste bud  <cit> . about 35% of the cells are type ii cells, which are also known as "light" cells due to the electron lucent nature of their cytoplasm. type ii cells express t1r and t2r taste receptor proteins and downstream signaling effectors for bitter, sweet, and umami taste stimuli  <cit> . these cells associate with afferent nerve fibers, but do not form morphologically identifiable synapses  <cit> . the remaining cells are type iii cells, sometimes referred to as "intermediate" cells. most, if not all of these cells lack receptors and signaling effectors for bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli but may be involved in sour taste transduction  <cit> . unlike type ii cells, type iii cells form synapses with nerve fibers that contain prominent pre and post synaptic specializations  <cit> . these observations have raised questions about the mechanisms used by type ii cells to communicate bitter, sweet, and umami information to the nervous system.

we have begun to address this question by characterizing the membrane properties and synaptic proteins expressed by type ii cells in mouse circumvallate taste buds. type ii cells are divisible into at least two subsets: one contains the t2r family of bitter receptors, while the other contains the t1r family of taste receptors, which normally exist as heterodimers. t1r <dig> + t1r <dig> is a broadly tuned amino acid receptor  <cit> , while t1r <dig> + t1r <dig> forms a receptor responsive to most sweet stimuli  <cit> . both t2rs and t1rs activate the plc signaling cascade, eliciting release of ca2+ from intracellular stores and presumed activation of the monovalent-selective cation channel, trpm <dig>  <cit> . recent electrophysiological studies suggest that the bitter-sensitive, α-gustducin-expressing subset of type ii cells lack voltage-gated ca2+ channels and have only small voltage-gated na+ and k+ currents  <cit> . do the t1r3-expressing type ii cells also lack voltage-gated ca2+ channels? these cells are of particular interest, because sweet stimuli generate large trains of action potentials, which might be expected to activate voltage-gated ca2+ channels  <cit> . to address this question, we used electrophysiology and ca2+ imaging of taste cells isolated from transgenic mice expressing gfp from either the t1r <dig> promoter  or the trpm <dig> promoter  to ask whether any taste cells co-express plc signaling components and voltage-gated ca2+ channels. in addition, we used immunoctyochemistry to determine if these taste cells express the target snare protein, snap- <dig>  which has previously been associated with synapses in taste cells  <cit> . our data suggest that the entire subset of taste cells that use the plc signaling pathway for transduction lack conventional synapses with the nervous system.

RESULTS
identification of receptor-expressing type ii taste cells
immunocytochemistry was performed to demonstrate that the gfp expression is representative of protein expression. we compared t1r3-like immunoreactivity  to t1r3-gfp and trpm5-lir to trpm5-gfp. most t1r3-lir and trpm5-lir was apparent in the membrane region and absent from the nuclear region. these immunoreactive cells have large round nuclei typical of type ii taste cells. immunoreactivity was confined to taste cells and not observed in the epithelium surrounding taste buds or nerve fibers. gfp differed from immunoreactivity in that it was seen throughout the cytosol and in the nuclear region. cells were counted as being gfp positive and/or immunoreactive only if a nuclear region and apical extension could be seen. in the t1r3-gfp animals we counted  <dig> taste buds and  <dig> cells from  <dig> mice. all t1r3-lir cells expressed gfp and 82% of the t1r3-gfp positive cells displayed t1r3-lir . the high background observed when using the t1r <dig> antibody may account for the small difference between t1r3-gfp and t1r3-lir. in  <dig> taste buds from  <dig> mice,  <dig> trpm5-gfp positive cells all displayed trpm5-lir and vice versa . we conclude that t1r3-gfp and trpm5-gfp are representative of the population of cells expressing these proteins. control sections in which the primary antibody was omitted showed no labeling.

ca2+ responses in t1r3-gfp cells
voltage gated ca2+ channels  are usually associated with conventional synapses. in neurons, these channels are responsible for the depolarization-induced ca2+ influx required for vesicular release. sweet responsive taste cells are known to generate trains of action potentials  <cit> , suggesting they may express voltage-gated ca2+ channels. to determine if t1r3-expressing taste cells possess vgccs, we loaded taste cells isolated from t1r3-gfp mice with bath-applied fura2-am, identified cells as gfp+ or gfp-, and used ratiometric imaging to monitor ca2+ responses. the field of view often contained both gfp-expressing and non-gfp-expressing cells. cells were challenged with a depolarizing high k+ solution followed by wash in tyrode's. no t1r3-gfp cells responded to the high k+ depolarizing stimulus , however, fourteen non-gfp cells showed a sharp ca2+ increase in response to high k+ . these responses were repeatable with little run down, and demonstrate that the cell preparation contained cells with viable vgccs. as an additional control for cell viability, we examined ca2+ responses to the plc activator, m-3m3fbs. we expected all gfp-expressing cells to exhibit a ca2+ response to the activator, because t1r <dig> couples to the plc signaling pathway  <cit> . most t1r3-gfp cells and few non-gfp cells showed a ca2+ response to  <dig> μm m-3m3fbs . responses to the plc activator were blocked by the plc inhibitor, u <dig>  indicating that m-3m3fbs is activating plc in taste cells . responses to the plc activator varied among cells in that some exhibited a return to baseline while others did not, effectively killing the cell. gfp expressing taste cells that did not show a ca2+ response to m-3m3fbs were eliminated from further analysis.

ca2+ responses in trpm5-gfp cells
trpm <dig> is co-expressed with other plc signaling effectors found in type ii cells  <cit> . these components are downstream of the t2r and t1r taste receptors for bitter, sweet, and umami taste . to examine this larger population of cells, we isolated taste cells from trpm5-gfp expressing mice. cells were loaded with bath applied fura2-am and assessed as gfp+ or gfp-. all trpm5-gfp expressing taste cells tested  failed to show increases in ca2+ in response to high k+ depolarization, although they showed ca2+ responses to the plc activator 3m3fbs . similar to the t1r3-gfp mice, a small subset of non-gfp expressing taste cells showed sharp and repeatable increases in intracellular ca2+ to high k+, suggesting that the cell population was viable.

whole cell voltage clamp recording
since many vgccs show at least some inactivation with prolonged depolarization, it is possible that we failed to see ca2+ responses in some cells due to damage during isolation or photo bleaching of gfp during ca2+ imaging. to control for this possibility, we used whole cell voltage-clamp recording of t1r3-gfp labeled taste cells as an additional assay for the presence of vgccs. in normal tyrode's solution, all taste cells tested  exhibited small voltage-gated na+ and k+ currents in response to  <dig> mv depolarizing steps from a holding potential of - <dig> mv. to test for the presence of vgccs, we treated cells with a tyrode's solution containing bacl <dig>  ttx, and tea. . under these conditions, no inward currents were elicited, suggesting that these cells do not possess vgccs . as a control for the methodology, we also tested several non-gfp expressing taste cells. a small subset of these cells displayed large voltage-gated na+ and k+ currents and a large, slowly inactivating inward current in the bacl <dig> tyrode's . the i/v profile of this current suggests it is elicited by high threshold vgccs, possibly of the l or p/q type . these whole cell data corroborate our ca2+ imaging data and suggest that the lack of response to high k+ depolarization in gfp positive cells is not due to inactivation of voltage-gated ca2+ channels.

t1r <dig> and snap- <dig> expression
the presynaptic protein snap- <dig> is part of the snare complex that plays a role in the release of neurotransmitter from cells . immuno electron microscopy studies on rat taste buds showed that snap- <dig> is expressed in appromiately 98% of taste cells with conventional synapses  <cit> . to determine if t1r3-expressing taste cells display evidence of snap- <dig> expression, we used immunocytochemistry to identify mouse taste cells expressing snap- <dig> and compared this to the expression of t1r3-gfp. we examined  <dig>  <dig> μm sections from circumvallate taste buds of four mice and found no overlap between snap-25-lir and t1r3-gfp expression .

trpm <dig> and snap- <dig> expression
t1r <dig> is present in a subset of the cells that express trpm <dig>  which is believed to be expressed in all type ii taste cells. to determine if the entire trpm <dig> population lacks expression of snap- <dig>  we tested circumvallate papillae from the trpm5-gfp mice with the antibody to snap- <dig>  we examined  <dig> sections from four mice, but failed to find any overlap between trpm <dig> expression and snap-25-lir .

discussion
our data using multiple approaches strongly suggest that the taste receptor cells responsible for sweet, umami, and bitter taste transduction lack voltage-gated ca2+ channels and presynaptic machinery normally required for conventional synaptic transmission. these data are consistent with other physiological  <cit> , molecular  <cit> , and ultrastructural  <cit>  findings suggesting that plc expressing taste cells in rodents lack conventional synapses with the nervous system. however, medler et al.  <cit>  reported that one subset of type ii cells had voltage-gated ca2+ channels. type ii cells in that study were identified by immunoreactivity to an external epitope marker, antigen a, that was reported to be expressed selectively on type ii taste cells in rats  <cit> . antigen a immunoreactivity has not been examined at the ultrastructural level in mouse taste buds, so it is possible that antigen a is labeling some type iii cells in addition to type ii cells. alternatively, it is possible that some type ii cells in mouse do not express plc signaling components. further studies will be required to resolve this discrepancy. our data also differ significantly from those of oike et al.  <cit> , who recently reported a large number of plcβ2-expressing cells also express snap-25-lir. their studies involved rat taste buds, so it is possible that a species difference is the source of the discrepancy. we do not believe this to be the case, since ultrastructural studies show that plcβ <dig> does not appear to be expressed in rat taste cells with conventional synapses  <cit> , which yang et al.  <cit>  earlier showed express snap-25-lir.

the lack of voltage-gated ca2+ channels is surprising, because type ii taste cells have voltage-gated na+ and k+ channels  and generate action potentials to at least sweet stimuli  <cit> . in addition, trpm <dig> is a monovalent cation channel and thus is unable to contribute to the ca2+ influx needed for synaptic transmission  <cit> . trpm <dig> is, however, clearly critical for bitter, sweet, and umami transduction  <cit> , suggesting that it contributes to membrane depolarization, which apparently is required for transduction and afferent signaling. how is taste information from type ii receptor cells communicated to afferent nerve fibers? one possibility is that type ii cells communicate with the nervous system through the agency of type iii cells. such communication may involve gap junctions, which were recently shown to be present in mouse taste buds  <cit> . action potentials elicited by taste stimuli in type ii cells would depolarize type iii cells, which would activate afferent nerve fibers by conventional synaptic mechanisms. ultrastructural studies have shown that type iii cells form conventional synapses with the nervous system  <cit> . further, electrophysiological studies revealed that type iii cells, identified by the type iii cell marker ncam, have vgccs  <cit> . thus, type iii cells have the properties necessary to serve as output cells for the taste bud.

an alternate hypothesis is that type ii cells communicate directly with afferent nerve fibers, but use unconventional mechanisms. afferent nerve fibers do associate with type ii taste cells and form subsurface cisternae at sites of contact, although it is not clear how these specializations might contribute to afferent signaling  <cit> . type ii taste cells contain vesicles and the vesicle snare protein synaptobrevin- <dig>  <cit> , although the vesicles are not usually associated with nerve fiber contact. it has recently been shown that the purinergic receptors p2x <dig> and p2x <dig>  expressed on gustatory afferent nerve fibers, are required for transmission of taste information to the nervous system  <cit> . perhaps atp is released via a non-conventional mechanism from plc signaling cells to activate nerve fibers directly. in neurons, atp release is usually vesicular and ca2+ dependent  <cit> . however, in non-neuronal cells, atp can be released by a number of unconventional mechanisms, including voltage-dependent anion channels and gap junction hemi channels  <cit> . further studies will be required to determine if type ii taste cells communicate directly with nerve fibers or through the agency of type iii cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the principal finding in this study is that the cells responsible for bitter, sweet, and umami taste transduction do not have conventional synapses with the nervous system. two separate lines of transgenic mice allowed identification of the sweet- and umami-sensitive cells, t1r3-gfp, and the larger subset of bitter-, sweet-, and umami-sensitive cells, trpm5-gfp. both subsets, t1r3-gfp and trpm5-gfp, lack vgccs. further, they lack the target snare protein snap- <dig> that has previously been associated with taste cells that have morphologically identifiable synapses  <cit> . we conclude that plc expressing taste cells do not communicate with the nervous system via conventional synaptic mechanisms.
