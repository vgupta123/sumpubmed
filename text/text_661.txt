BACKGROUND
concentrated animal feeding operations  are sources for new, more infectious or antibiotic resistant microorganisms that can spread to humans and the environment  <cit> . for example, feeder cattle raised in cafo's have been linked to the contamination of ground beef with antibiotic resistant s. enterica  <cit> . this is not an isolated problem, virtually all cafo's within the u. s. experience chronic problems with livestock diseases  <cit>  and domestic cattle  are known reservoirs of many gastrointestinal  pathogens including the bacterium salmonella enterica  <cit> . because of economic losses and human health risks managing disease in cafo's is of paramount importance to livestock producers. to manage disease, producers need better information on the specific risk pathways that contribute to the spread and maintenance of pathogenic microorganisms within their cafo's. one of these risk pathways is the wildlife-livestock interface.

salmonella enterica is a ubiquitous microorganism in cafo's that has been linked to peridomestic wildlife use of feedlots and dairies  <cit> . in cafo's, cattle typically acquire s. enterica from other infected livestock which spread the pathogen throughout the herd via contaminated cattle feces  <cit> , cattle feed  <cit> , and water  <cit> . reducing contamination from these sources is important because clinical and subclinical s. enterica infections in cattle can cause significant economic losses to producers and can lead to carcass contamination at the slaughterhouse  <cit> . carcass contamination contributes to human salmonellosis, which is responsible for an estimated  <dig>  million human cases,  <dig>  hospitalizations, and  <dig> deaths each year  <cit> . recent empirical evidence suggests that small mammal and bird feces may be a significant source of s. enterica contamination of animal feed, which by itself is capable of explaining the infection levels seen in cattle herds  <cit> .

european starlings  were placed on the invasive species specialist groups list of " <dig> worlds worst" biological invaders  <cit> . starlings damage plant and animal agriculture by consuming crops destined for human and livestock consumption  <cit> . starling damage to agriculture within the u.s. was estimated at $ <dig> million annually  <cit> . feed consumption by starlings in cafo's is well documented. besser et al.  <cit>  reported that individual starlings in cage trials consumed approximately  <dig> ounce of livestock ration per day. glahn and otis  <cit>  reported consumption of about  <dig>  lbs of cattle feed per  <dig>  bird minutes. white et al.  <cit>  estimated that starlings consumed  <dig> metric tons of corn from feedlots within their study area around milan, tennessee between  <dig> and  <dig> 

in addition to crop damage and livestock feed consumption starlings are known carriers of many human and cattle pathogens, including s. enterica  <cit> . starlings have also been implicated as a source for s. enterica contamination of cattle feed and water  <cit>  and this information was collected, in part, from the two cafos used for this study. additionally, many other publications suggest wild birds may contribute to the maintenance and spread of s. enterica  <cit> . currently, there is no data assessing starling control as a tool to reduce the amplification and spread of s. enterica within cafo's.

population management programs have been implemented in many parts of the world to mitigate bird damage to agriculture  <cit> . within the united states a common form of starling management involves lethal chemical control using drc- <dig> . it is a slow-acting toxicant used to control starlings and blackbirds  <cit> . drc- <dig> is effective for reducing numbers of starlings in livestock facilities. besser et al.  <cit>  reduced a starling population by about 75% after spreading 1% drc 1339-treated poultry pellets at a cattle feedlot in nevada. west  <cit>  reduced a roost of  <dig>  starlings in colorado 60% by baiting feedlots and pastures.

our objective was to assess the efficacy of starling control as a potential tool to reduce s. enterica within cafo's. we matched a large cafo in the texas panhandle, slated for operational control using drc- <dig>  with a comparable reference facility that was not controlling birds. we sampled cattle feed, cattle water troughs and fresh cattle fecal pats within pen lanes for s. enterica before and after starling control operations in both the starling-controlled and reference facilities. specifically, we wanted to know if the starling-controlled cafo experienced reduced s. enterica contamination within cattle water troughs, feed bunks and cattle feces relative to the reference facility.

RESULTS
efficacy of starling control operations
drc- <dig> control operations were effective at reducing the number of starlings present within pen lanes . on the starling-controlled cafo there were on average  <dig>  starlings within pen lanes before drc- <dig> control and  <dig>  starlings within pen lanes after drc- <dig> control. on the reference cafo there were on average  <dig>  starlings within pen lanes before drc- <dig> control and  <dig>  starlings within pen lanes after drc- <dig> control. on the starling-controlled cafo, mean starling numbers per pen lanes were reduced  <dig> % following drc- <dig> starling control operations .

contamination within water troughs, feed bunks and cattle fecal samples
starling control was associated with decreased s. enterica contamination in water troughs . on the treatment cafo 28% of water troughs were contaminated with s. enterica before drc- <dig> control  and 5% of water troughs were contaminated after drc- <dig> control . on the reference cafo 5% of water troughs were contaminated before drc- <dig> control  and 45% of water troughs were contaminated after drc- <dig> control .

starling control was associated with decreased s. enterica contamination within feed bunks . on the treatment cafo 8% of feed bunks were contaminated with s. enterica before drc- <dig> control  and 0% of feed bunks were contaminated after drc- <dig> control . on the reference cafo 2% of feed bunks were contaminated before drc- <dig> control  and 5% of feed bunks were contaminated after drc- <dig> control .

starling control was not observed to reduce prevalence of s. enterica in the cattle herd . on the starling-controlled cafo 14% of fecal samples were contaminated with s. enterica before drc- <dig> control  and 15% of fecal samples were contaminated after drc- <dig> control . on the reference cafo 33% of fecal samples were contaminated before drc- <dig> control  and 50% of fecal samples were contaminated after drc- <dig> control .

serogroup and serotype data
from all sample types within both cafo's we isolated five different serogroups, with c <dig>  and e  comprising the majority serogroups isolated . comparisons between cafo's suggested there was little difference in the serogroups isolated. we isolated three salmonella serogroups from cattle feces within the starling controlled cafo with e  and c <dig>  comprising the majority of the cattle fecal isolates. we isolated three salmonella serogroups from cattle feces within the reference cafo with c <dig>  comprising the majority of the cattle fecal isolates. we isolated three salmonella serogroups from cattle water troughs within the starling-controlled cafo with c <dig>  and e  comprising the majority of the water trough isolates. we isolated three salmonella serogroups from cattle water troughs within the reference cafo with c <dig>  comprising the majority of the water trough isolates. salmonella serogroups e  and c <dig>  were isolated from feed within the starling-controlled cafo. salmonella serogroups e  and c <dig>  were isolated from feed within the reference cafo.

from all sample types within both cafo's we isolated a total of  <dig> different salmonella serotypes with s. montevideo  and s. anatum  comprising the majority isolated . comparisons between cafo's suggested there was little difference in the serotypes isolated. we isolated eight salmonella serotypes from cattle feces within the starling-controlled cafo with s. montevideo , s. anatum  and s. agona  comprising half of the serotypes isolated. within the reference cafo, we isolated eight salmonella serotypes from cattle feces with s. montevideo , and s. anatum  comprising a majority of the serotypes isolated. we isolated four salmonella serotypes from cattle water troughs within the starling-controlled cafo with s. anatum  and s. montevideo  comprising a majority of the serotypes isolated. within the reference cafo, we isolated six salmonella serotypes from cattle water troughs with s. montevideo  and s. anatum  comprising a majority of the serotypes isolated. salmonella serotypes s. meleagridis  and s. montevideo  were isolated from cattle feed within the starling-controlled cafo. salmonella serotypes s. anatum , s. montevideo , and rough o: e, h:  <dig>   <dig>  were isolated from cattle feed within the reference cafo.

discussion
we conducted this study to see if starling control could potentially be a viable management option for reducing s. enterica within cafo's. within the starling-controlled cafo, detection of s. enterica disappeared from feed bunks and substantially declined within water troughs following starling control operations. since contamination of cattle feed and water are obvious routes for the ingestion of s. enterica, starling control shows promise as a potential tool to help cafo operations reduce s. enterica contamination. this relationship was not as clear for cattle fecal samples. during the pre-treatment through post treatment periods, herd prevalence of s. enterica increased on the reference facility but herd prevalence of s. enterica on the starling-controlled cafo stayed at pretreatment levels.

post control sampling may have occurred too early to detect s. enterica reductions within cattle fecal samples. since the first of two drc- <dig> applications occurred a full two weeks before post control sampling we believed a change in fecal shedding rates could be detected within the starling-controlled pen lanes. in retrospect it is possible this time period was not long enough to detect a decrease in the number of cattle shedding s. enterica. additionally, cattle fecal shedding of s. enterica is likely to be compounded by additional factors that contribute to the infection process.

the interactions among s. enterica, affected cattle and their environment are complex  <cit> , and the role contaminated animal feed plays in s. enterica infections of food animals is not well understood  <cit> . this suggests that clinical and subclinical s. enterica infections in cattle are influenced by additional factors besides feed and water contamination. for example, herd size  <cit> , age of cattle  <cit> , manure management and disposal methods  <cit> , feed storage  <cit> , access to environmental waters  <cit> , season  <cit> , purchasing cattle from dealers  <cit> , method of cattle penning  <cit> , and exposure to wild birds and rodents  <cit>  have all been implicated as herd-level risk factors for s. enterica infections. thus, multiple biological, environmental and facility management factors will influence frequency and duration of cattle fecal shedding of s. enterica.

based upon our data and previously published information we believe starling control should only be considered as part of a comprehensive disease management plan, not a stand alone tool to reduce s. enterica in cafo's. in addition, starling control should only be used to manage s. enterica if additional research corroborates our findings. one should not assume this means starling control will not reduce s. enterica fecal shedding by cattle. if starling control is shown to be a reliable tool to reduce s. enterica loads in cattle feed and water, then starling control may have benefits throughout the farm to fork chain of food production. reducing s. enterica ingested through feed and water supplies may help reduce the number of colony forming units shed within the feces of infected cattle. the dose of s. enterica ingested by cattle is known to influence the risk of clinical infections and the subsequent amount of fecal shedding  <cit> . both contribute to carcass contamination within meat packing facilities which contributes to the contamination of human food products  <cit> . thus, starling control may be a cheap and effective tool producers can add to existing strategies for managing disease while also reducing other negative economic impacts imposed by large numbers of starlings, such as feed loss and cleanup costs.

it is important to remember that the inference of our study was limited to the two cafo's we sampled. based upon our data we believe further research examining the efficacy of bird control as a tool to reduce the amplification and spread of disease in cafo's is necessary. studies examining the efficacy of starling control need to be replicated using multiple cafo's in different geographic regions before control operations are adopted as a reliable disease management tool. future research should also consider additional risks that could be attributed to starling use of cafo's. for example, cafo's have been implicated as potential sources for microbial pollution of the environment  <cit>  thus starling control may help reduce the spread of s. enterica. lejeune et al.  <cit>  found that radio-collared starlings regularly traveled 20-km from their roost site to access dairies in ohio and some of the radio collared starlings visited multiple facilities. this suggests that starlings could potentially transport s. enterica between cafo's, aiding in the spread and maintenance of s. enterica between otherwise isolated facilities. also, migratory starlings may transport s. enterica over large geographic areas. hubálek  <cit>  suggested that starlings could be one of many avian species responsible for wide ranging geographic dispersal of microorganisms. this is supported by the work of palmgren  <cit>  that found multidrug resistant strains of s. enterica typhimurium in migrating birds in sweden.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study suggest that starling control may reduce the amplification and spread of s. enterica to cattle feed and water supplies. in addition, we also believe starling control may help reduce other chronic livestock diseases spread through the fecal-oral route of contamination. it is unlikely that the ecological interactions between european starlings, s. enterica, and cattle are the only disease risks that can be attributed to peridomestic wildlife use of cafo's. starlings may contribute to the maintenance and spread of other pathogens in cafo's and other wildlife species may contribute to the maintenance and spread of s. enterica. identifying high risk wildlife, pathogens, and their various ecological interactions with domesticated animals is needed to characterize the disease risks, production costs, and environmental impacts associated with peridomestic wildlife use of cafo's.
