BACKGROUND
the jak-stat pathway is known to play a pivotal role in a variety of different cytokine cascades. jaks  are associated with intracellular domains of receptors and become phosphorylated after ligand binding and aggregation of respective receptor chains. activated jaks phosphorylate tyrosine residues of the receptor, thereby providing docking sites for stats . stats are in turn phosphorylated on tyrosine and/or serine residues, form homo- and/or heterodimers, translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of stimulus-dependent genes  <cit> . seven mammalian members of the stat family are known  and they all share common features and structure. they have an aminoterminal dna-binding domain, a carboxyterminal transactivation domain and sh <dig> domains for interaction with tyrosine phosphorylation sites  <cit> . stat <dig> knockout mice show impaired response to interferon  type i and ii leading to high susceptibility to viruses and other pathogens  <cit> . in addition, stat <dig> is known to be involved in mechanisms like cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis  <cit>  and phosphorylation-independent stat <dig> functions have been postulated  <cit> . based on the multiple functions of stat <dig> identified through the generation of stat <dig> knockout mice, our aim was to establish a system to study stat <dig> gene function in a spatiotemporal and dose-dependent manner. in addition, we and others reported clearly reduced stat <dig> protein levels in mice deficient for certain components of the ifn and tlr  signaling cascades  <cit> . availability of stat <dig> protein is critical for a number of host cell responses and limitations may well contribute to the phenotype of these mice. a system for regulated stat <dig> expression would additionally provide a tool for uncoupling effects caused by stat <dig> protein levels from the phenotype due to targeted deletion of the gene of interest.

during the last decade several inducible expression systems have been described and although a lot of improvements have been implemented they all have certain limitations  <cit> . for our purpose, high inducibility, tight regulation, suitability for in vivo pathogen challenges and, importantly, absence of basal transcriptional activity are the major requirements. these criteria have been described for rapamycin-regulated expression systems  <cit> . these systems are based on rapamycin-induced dimerization of two fusion proteins of a rapamycin binding domain each fused to a transactivation domain  or a dna-binding domain , respectively. both fusion proteins are expressed constitutively from a bicistronic mrna. upon rapamycin treatment dbd and tad dimerize to form a functional transcription factor and in turn activate transcription from a recognition site positioned upstream of the target gene. mutations in the rapamycin binding domain have made the use of non-immunosuppressive analogs  possible  <cit> . rapamycin and rapalogs are orally applicable, have prolonged pharmacokinetics and can cross the blood brain barrier. the rapamycin system has been first evaluated in vitro  <cit>  and in transient in vivo studies  <cit>  and since then used with a variety of vector systems mainly for clinical development  <cit> . so far the system has not been described in transgenic mouse models.

we have constructed a two-vector based rapalog-inducible system for stat <dig> expression and evaluated applicability in stable murine systems according to the above-mentioned requirements. using stably transfected mouse embryonic fibroblast  cell lines we proved inducibility, tightness of expression and the biological functions of transgenically expressed stat <dig> protein. we furthermore demonstrate rapalog-dependent stat <dig> expression in double-transgenic embryonic stem  cells, thereby providing a second, independent cell system for regulated stat <dig> expression. with respect to in vivo applicability for transgenic mouse models, we demonstrate functionality of the individual constructs and the proof of principle in double-transgenic animals.

the inducible system described herein provides a novel tool for the analysis of time- and dose-dependent stat <dig> functions and will complement the knowledge obtained from the analysis of stat1-deficient cells and mice.

RESULTS
generation of a modified two-vector-based rapalog-inducible system for stat <dig> expression
the rapalog-inducible expression system comprises of the rapalog binding components frb  and fkbp  fused to a tad  and a dbd , respectively  <cit> . both fusion proteins are expressed from a bicistronic mrna . rapalog-dimerized dbd and tad bind the zfhd <dig> recognition site upstream of a minimal il <dig> promoter. the dbd-tad and the target gene components are either located on separate or within one vector construct. our initial stable transfection experiments in murine fibroblasts indicated background expression if all components were present in one vector  and we therefore focused on the two-vector system . the original expression vector contains the transcription factor components under the control of the constitutive cmv enhancer/promoter. this promoter is frequently silenced in transgenic mouse models  <cit> , thus we decided to make use of two alternative constitutive promoters  <cit> . we cloned the two transcription factor components into an expression vector under the control of the elongation factor  1α promoter  <cit>  or the cmv enhancer/β-actin promoter   <cit> , repectively . the second vector was generated by insertion of the stat1α cdna into the argent™ target vector .

stat <dig> is expressed in a dose- and time-dependent manner and is stable after removal of the dimerizer
stat1-deficient mef cell lines were stably transfected with the constructs pef::dbd-tad and pzfhd1::mstat <dig> and clones were screened for stat <dig> expression. to evaluate inducibility of the system, cells were stimulated with rapalog and stat <dig> expression was determined using western blot  analysis. data are shown for one representative clone . stat <dig> is expressed in a dose-  and time-  dependent manner upon rapalog treatment. stat <dig> protein expression in the stably transfected clone s2rs # <dig> reaches similar levels as in wildtype  cells upon  <dig> h treatment with 50– <dig> nm rapalog. stat <dig> protein expression is detectable at about 2– <dig> h and protein levels further increase up to at least  <dig> h treatment.

to investigate presence of stat <dig> protein after removal of dimerizer, cells were treated with rapalog for  <dig> h, washed with pbs and further incubated in the absence of rapalog. as shown in fig. 2c, stat <dig> protein was still detectable to similar levels  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after removal of the extracellular dimerizer. thus, as an important point for the in vivo practicability of the system, active transcription factor and/or stat <dig> mrna/protein stability is sufficient to ensure prolonged availability of stat <dig> protein after elimination of extracellular dimerizer.

ifnγ-mediated stat <dig> activation is rapalog-dependent in stat1-/- fibroblasts reconstituted with inducible stat1
next, we tested cytokine-induced stat <dig> activation upon rapalog treatment. wt, stat1-/- cells and stat1-/- cells reconstituted with inducible stat <dig>  were stimulated with rapalog and subsequently treated with ifnγ or left untreated. stat <dig> dna-binding activity could be detected after  <dig> h treatment over a range of 5– <dig> nm rapalog, although, consistent with the protein expression data, the level under these conditions is lower than in wt cells. dna-binding activity was observed from  <dig> h treatment onwards with  <dig> nm rapalog  and further increased with time. in addition to the rapalog-dependent stat <dig> homodimer formation also stat1/stat <dig> heterodimers could be detected in s2rs # <dig> cells upon ifnγ stimulation, demonstrating that transgenic stat <dig> can interact normally with stat <dig>  in the absence of dimerizer stat <dig> dna-binding activity was not detectable, further substantiating the non-leakiness of the system. stat <dig> dna-binding activity  and stat <dig> phosphorylation  remained dependent on cytokine stimulation, which is another important determinant for the evaluation of a useful stat <dig> expression system.

inducible stat <dig> protein is a biological active transcription factor
to examine the biological functions of the inducible stat <dig> protein we stimulated cells with ifnγ and analyzed transcriptional activation of stat1-dependent, ifnγ-inducible genes. we performed semiquantitative rt-pcr to detect guanylate binding protein  <dig>  and interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  mrna  and quantitative rt-pcr  to detect inducible nitrite oxide synthase  mrna . the reconstituted clone s2rs # <dig> showed transcriptional induction of all three genes upon ifnγ stimulation in the presence of rapalog. without rapalog gene induction was not detected, again underlining the tightness of the expression system. stat1-/- cells stably expressing the transcription factor components only  did not show gene induction upon ifnγ treatment in both, the absence or presence of rapalog. quantitative analysis of inos mrna expression revealed similar ifnγ-mediated induction in s2rs # <dig> and wt cells. importantly, rapalog treatment did not influence the transcriptional activity of stat <dig> in ifnγ-stimulated wt cells . the slight increase in inos mrna expression in rapalog/ifnγ-treated wt cells  was not consistently observed. as shown for gbp <dig> and irf <dig>  inos mrna was not induced in stat1-/- and spef # <dig> cells upon rapalog and/or ifnγ treatment. consistent with the data for stat <dig> dna-binding activity, also gene induction remained dependent on a cytokine stimulus in stat1-expressing cells. these results demonstrate the biological activity of the inducible stat <dig> transgene at the example of three independent target genes.

inducible stat <dig> protein can mediate antiviral protection
stat <dig> is crucial for the ifnγ-induced defense against vesicular stomatitis virus  infection  <cit> . to show that inducibly expressed stat <dig> protein is also able to restore complex biological functions, we analyzed antiviral activity against vsv infection. ifnγ induced antiviral activity in rapalog-pretreated but not in untreated s2rs # <dig> cells . the amount of ifnγ required for resistance against vsv was similar in rapalog-treated s2rs # <dig> and wt cells. rapalog treatment of wt, stat1-/- and spef # <dig> cells did not influence intrinsic or ifnγ-induced resistance against vsv infection . hence, stat1-dependent ifnγ responses involving multiple and complex mechanisms can be inducibly restored with this stat <dig> expression system.

stably transfected embryonic stem  cells express transgenic stat <dig> protein dependent on the presence of rapalog
to test the rapalog-inducible stat <dig> system in another independent cell system, we stably transfected es cells with the two constructs ef::dbd-tad and zfhd1::mstat <dig>  we identified several clones with different expression levels of rapalog-inducible stat <dig>  clone #a <dig> expressed low transgenic stat <dig> mrna levels, whereas in clone #b <dig> rapalog-induced stat <dig> expression was as high as in the mef cell line s2rs # <dig> . as expected, no transgenic stat <dig> mrna was detected in wt es cells. expression levels of endogenous stat <dig> mrna in es cell clones #a <dig> and #b <dig> was similar to wt es cells, demonstrating that induction of transgenic stat <dig> expression has no obvious influence on endogenous stat <dig> expression . rapalog-dependent increase of stat <dig> protein was clearly detectable in clone #b <dig>  but was not observed in clone #a <dig> . accordingly, the expression level of both transcription factor components tad and dbd in clone #b <dig> was similar to the level in mef cell line s2rs # <dig> . increase of stat <dig> protein level is difficult to analyze in es cells since they express endogenous stat <dig> and for as yet unknown reasons, we could not detect the minimal flag-tag fused to the transgenic stat <dig>  expression of stat <dig> protein upon rapalog treatment in clone #b <dig> clearly exceeds wt levels and, as another important point for the analysis of stat <dig> function, does not lead to dramatic overexpression. taken together, these data show that this dimerizer-inducible expression system is suitable for the use in es cells.

the two individual components of the expression system are functional as transgenes
to test the applicability of the two individual vector components as transgenes respective constructs were microinjected into zygotes. three mouse lines transgenic for the zfhd1::mstat <dig> were obtained by dna-microinjection and analyzed for transgene expression. since no gene expression occurs from this construct in the absence of the transcription factor components and the dimerizer, we isolated primary embryonic fibroblasts , transiently transfected the pef::dbd-tad construct and analyzed rapalog-inducible transgenic stat <dig> mrna expression. data are shown for pef from four embryos of two individual mice  from the same transgenic mouse line . pef from at least one embryo per mouse expressed transgenic stat <dig> mrna . as in the stably transfected mef cell lines, stat <dig> expression was strictly dependent on rapalog stimulation in the transgenic situation. similar results were obtained with a second transgenic mouse line, whereas the third line analyzed did not show any stat <dig> expression . these data prove the functionality of the stat <dig> target construct  as a transgene in vivo. notably, even in the presence of high amounts of the transcription factor components in the transient transfection experiment, stat <dig> expression remained dependent on rapalog.

mice transgenic for the transcription factor components were initially generated with the ef::dbd-tad construct. several transgenic mouse lines generated either via dna-microinjection or via blastocyst injection of pre-screened es cells showed ubiquitous but low expression of the transcription factor components as compared to the mef cell line s2rs # <dig> or the es cell clone #b <dig> . amongst nine transmitting mouse lines, five lines expressed the dbd-tad mrna, but only one of them showed detectable tad protein expression. expression levels of transcription factor domains were in all mice clearly lower than in the mef cell lines and es cells stably transfected with the same construct . in contrast, analysis of pef from mice generated by blastocyst injection of es cells transgenic for the transcription factor components under the control of the cmv enhancer/β-actin promoter  revealed higher expression of tad than in pef derived from ef::dbd-tad mice. tad protein level was comparable to that in s2rs # <dig> cells and hence should be sufficient for inducible stat <dig> expression . the transcription factor components in act::dbd-tad mice were expressed in all tissues tested, although the expression level varied amongst different tissues . heart, liver, lung and muscle showed high expression of tad, whereas in brain, spleen and testis the expression level of transcription factor components was significantly lower and barely detectable in kidney. in addition, we observed that tad expression also varied amongst individual mice and littermates. the majority of mice analyzed showed lower expression level of the transcription factor than the mef cell line s2rs # <dig> and the es cell clone used for the generation of these mice .

double-transgenic mice  show inducible transgenic stat <dig> mrna upon rapalog stimulation
to investigate whether the amount of transcription factor components in act::dbd-tad mice  is sufficient to induce transgenic stat <dig> in vivo, these mice were crossed with three different zfhd1::mstat <dig> mouse lines . pef were isolated from single embryos, genotyped and double-transgenic clones were first screened for expression of the transcription factor components. pef from one out of six embryos showed high expression levels of the transcription factor components . in pef # <dig> tad expression was similar to the mef cell line s2rs # <dig>  whereas pef derived from all other embryos showed clearly lower expression levels . next, we stimulated these double-transgenic pef with rapalog and analyzed transgenic stat <dig> mrna expression by rt-pcr. basal expression of transgenic stat <dig> was not seen in pef from any of the embryos tested, thereby proving the tightness of the system also in vivo. transgenic stat <dig> mrna could be induced upon rapalog stimulation in pef # <dig>  which had high tad expression levels , but not in cells with low tad expression. although stat <dig> mrna was clearly induced, we could not detect stat <dig> protein against the background of endogenous stat <dig> . however, this set of experiments shows that transgenic stat <dig> can be induced in pef derived from double-transgenic mice and that the dimerizer-based system is in principle functional in transgenic mouse models.

discussion
in this study we established a rapalog-inducible expression system for stat <dig>  using stat1-/- mef cell lines stably reconstituted with the inducible stat <dig> expression system, we show that stat <dig> protein is tightly controllable: in the absence of inducer no expression is detectable and the amount of expression is dependent on the dose of dimerizer applied. although expression levels varied, as expected, amongst different clones, a reconstituted cell line with stat <dig> levels up to wt cells could be obtained. induction occurs rapidly, increases over time and stat <dig> protein is stable after removal of dimerizer for at least up to  <dig> h . inducible stat <dig> protein is biologically active and can restore the ifnγ response defects in stat1-/- cells. no effects on ifnγ responses were observed in cells expressing the dbd-tad domains alone . we generated stably transfected es cells and proved the functionality of the stat <dig> expression system in an independent cell type and in a stat1+/+ background . recently, inducible expression systems have been described for the use in es cells, mainly based on the tetracycline system  <cit> . to our knowledge this is the first report, demonstrating dimerizer-based inducible gene expression in es cells.

we present several attempts to apply this system in transgenic mouse models and prove the principle of in vivo applicability. we analyzed the functionality of each of the constructs of the two vector-based system in single-transgenic mice  and show that inducible expression can be achieved by transient transfection with the respective second construct. expression of stat <dig> remained strictly dependent on the dimerizer even in the presence of access of either of the two constructs . transgenic mice for the transcription factor components under the control of the ef1α promoter  showed ubiquitous but low level of expression. pef from double-transgenic mice obtained by crossing zfhd1::mstat with ef::dbd-tad did not show any stat <dig> induction upon rapalog treatment. lack of stat <dig> induction in these mice is most likely due to the low expression of the transcription factor components, since direct correlation of dbd-tad expression and target gene expression has been reported before  <cit> . in contrast, mice transgenic for the transcription factor components under the control of the cmv enhancer/β-actin promoter  <cit>   showed higher expression levels of the transcription factor components. at least in pef from one embryo tested, expression levels were similar to the levels obtained in the stable transfected mef and es cell clones that do express sufficient amounts for stat <dig> protein induction . higher in vivo expression correlated with higher expression levels in es cells in vitro . unfortunately, the expression pattern of dbd-tad in these mice was variegated between organs and even between full siblings , a phenomenon that has been widely described for transgenic animals  <cit> . upon crossing these mice with single-transgenic zfhd1::mstat <dig> mice, pef from one out of six embryos showed inducible stat <dig> expression. stat <dig> expression was again dependent on rapalog stimulation proving the non-leakiness of the system in vivo. stat <dig> inducibility correlated with high expression of dbd-tad, further underlining that sufficient dbd-tad expression is one of the limiting factors of the system . however, we could not detect transgenic stat <dig> protein against the background of endogenous stat <dig> even in the presence of high amounts of transcription factor components . one possible explanation is, that transgene silencing effects  <cit>  also occur in zfhd1::mstat <dig> mice and that the accessibility of the target promoter is also gene locus dependent. since transient transfection of dbd-tad into cells derived from these mice does lead to sufficient stat <dig> induction  it is most likely a combinatorial effect of the integration loci of both constructs. one possible solution would be to screen a large number of independent single- and double-transgenic animals for stable and sufficient dbd-tad expression and stat <dig> inducibility. since this is a very time- and animal-intensive approach, future studies will focus on homologous integration of both, dbd-tad and zfhd1::mstat <dig> separately into es cells. single copy integration of the transgenes into established loci in the mouse genome should avoid any silencing mechanisms and ensure defined and stable expression levels in vivo  <cit> . variegated dbd-tad expression amongst individuals/littermates and the crucial role of dbd-tad levels for stat <dig> induction makes in vivo rapalog treatment experiments with zfhd1::mstat <dig> × act::dbd-tad mice currently inpracticable. additional complexity in variability might come from interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics and/or intracellular bioavailability of the transcription factor components and rapalog. at this stage this cannot formally be excluded. however, in vivo functionality of rapamycin-derivatives as synthetic inducers of biological functions and of the transcription factor components in various cellular environments has been demonstrated  <cit> . in contrast to other synthetic inducible expression systems, i.e. ecdysone or tetracycline  <cit> , the tad used here might undergo post-translational modifications. indeed, in preliminary experiments we have observed conditional phosphorylation of tad at one specific site paralleling the modification of the endogenous p65/nfκb . in vitro, in mef cell lines and es cells, phosphorylation-independent tad activity leading to rapalog-induced stat <dig> expression has been demonstrated . further studies are required to address the dependence of tad activity on the status of the endogenous p65/nfκb regulation with respect to additional known phosphorylation sites and different cellular contexts. however, variegated expression of the dbd-tad components is currently the crucial point for in vivo functionality of this system. therefore, this makes it to our opinion worthwhile to solve the issue of obvious chromatin positioning effects on the transgenes.

for the use of inducible expression systems no or minimal off-target effects are preferable. as with other systems, possible side-effects cannot be excluded and have to be assessed for each specific application. here, no off-target effects concerning the dimerized transcription factor components or rapalog treatment alone could be observed in two independent biological assay conditions .

in summary, the rapalog-inducible stat <dig> expression system established in this report provides a novel tool to study dose- and time-dependent stat <dig> functions in fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells. our attempts to introduce the system into transgenic mice gave proof of principle functionality and future directives for improvements.

CONCLUSIONS
inducible temporal gene expression systems are indispensable tools for fine-tuned analysis of gene functions. all reported systems have some limitations  <cit> . here we report the application of a novel rapalog-inducible stat <dig> expression system in vitro and in vivo. stat <dig> is a transcriptional activator central for the signaling of a variety of cytokines and growth factors. stat <dig> functions range from immune regulation to tumorigenesis and timely availability of stat <dig> protein is thought to be crucial for normal cellular function. we show that rapalog-induced stat <dig> expression in vitro is highly inducible and tightly controllable demonstrating the potential of this inducible system. using reconstitution experiments we show that rapalog-induced stat <dig> fulfills all main stat <dig> functions and thus is a novel tool to unravel stat <dig> functions in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

we show that rapalog-inducible stat <dig> expression can be achieved in vivo, although stat <dig> induction is impaired by transgene silencing effects in transgenic mice harbouring randomly integrated gene constructs. these effects can be avoided by stable integration of single copies of each expression vector into established loci in the mouse genome. an inducible stat <dig> expression system in vivo could identify stat1-independent gene functions in several knockout mice with reduced stat <dig> level. a rapalog-inducible expression system would also be a powerful alternative to existing inducible expression systems in vivo.
