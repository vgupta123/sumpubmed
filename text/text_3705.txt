BACKGROUND
consolidated bioprocessing  refers to single-vessel microbial transformation of inexpensive biomass such as agricultural or forestry cellulosic wastes into fuels or other useful chemicals. this approach is based on the power of specific microbes or consortia to simultaneously degrade and transform plant cell wall components into ethanol or other molecules of interest  <cit> . cellulolytic clostridia such as clostridium thermocellum and c. stercorarium are among the most widely studied organisms for cbp, producing a wide range of cellulases, xylanases and other lignocellulolytic enzymes  <cit> . however, multiple end products resulting from branching metabolic pathways and low overall ethanol production mitigates the feasibility of industrial cbp using these organisms. for example, selected strains of c. stercorarium have been shown to produce up to ~ <dig> % w/v  ethanol in laboratory batch cultures  <cit> . improvements of at least an order of magnitude will be required to rival current yeast/starch-based processes for bioethanol production.

two main strategies have emerged to increase ethanol production by these organisms. first, genetic modification has been applied and found to modestly improve yields of ethanol or other biofuels, usually through knocking out elements in undesired metabolic pathways  <cit> . second, defined co-cultures of organisms with contrasting or potentially synergistic enzymes for lignocellulose degradation and utilization have been applied, again with modest improvements in biofuels production . central to both of these strategies is a refined conceptual framework and well-defined lignocellulolytic and central metabolic pathways for organisms of interest  <cit> . to this end, application of next-generation systems biology tools, including genome sequencing and transcriptional/protein profiling has expanded rapidly in the past 10 years , along with increasingly sophisticated techniques for integrating and visualizing these vast datasets  <cit> . basic techniques in this field are in constant flux and yielding ever more detailed information. for example, increasingly powerful mass spectrometers are reducing the importance of gel-based separation or laser desorption techniques in proteomics  <cit>  and microarrays for transcriptomics are increasingly displaced by next-generation rna sequencing   <cit> . genome sequencing has become trivial at a technical level, as evidenced by the steady accumulation of brief announcements in the literature, however the currency of in-depth molecular profiling provides an opportunity to improve, confirm and contextualize genome sequence data. this information is critical for designing and interpreting effects of metabolic engineering or co-culture experiments to improve biofuel yields.

with the ultimate goal of developing “designer co-cultures” for biofuels production, our group has recently published genome- and proteome-level descriptions of central metabolism in biofuels organisms of interest  <cit> . the ethanologenic thermophile clostridium stercorarium dsm8532t has been investigated extensively to characterize its complement of lignocellulolytic enzymes , however substrate transport and central metabolic pathways for this organism have not been described in detail. preferential hemicellulolysis and xylose utilization by c. stercorarium
 <cit>  suggests that it may be compatible in co-culture with c. thermocellum, a rapid cellulose-degrader that does not metabolize xylose. therefore, the goal of this study was to define metabolic potential encoded by the whole genome sequence of c. stercorarium dsm8532t, in the context of high-throughput molecular profiling using rna-seq and high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry.

methods
anaerobic culture
c. stercorarium dsm8532t was acquired from deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen  and sub-cultured to single colonies on simplified  <dig> agar:   <dig> % potassium phosphate ,  <dig> % sodium phosphate ,  <dig> % ammonium chloride ,  <dig> % magnesium chloride ,  <dig> % l-cysteine, 1 ml of  <dig> % w/v resazurin solution ,  <dig> % yeast extract, and  <dig> % agar , ph  <dig> . resuspended stock was spread onto non-reduced plates under normal aerobic conditions in a biosafety cabinet and incubated in jars with gaspak ez sachets  for 72 h at 65°c. growth from plates inoculated with single colonies were transferred aseptically to 50 ml liquid culture  using a syringe and needle in nitrogen-gassed butyl-stoppered serum bottles with cellobiose or xylose  added aseptically after autoclaving . serial transfers were inoculated with 5 ml  overnight pre-cultures . concentration of hydrogen and carbon dioxide were determined using a varian benchtop gas chromatograph  using standard curves made with degassed butyl-stoppered bottles containing known concentrations of each gas . concentrations of liquid components  were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography  using an isocratic pump  and refractive index detector , with standard curves derived from stock solutions of each component. genomic dna was isolated from overnight cultures growing on  <dig> % cellobiose using the genomic dna wizard kit  according to supplier’s protocol. rna for transcriptomics was isolated from mid-exponential phase culture , on  <dig> % cellobiose. protein was isolated from pooled mid-exponential phase cultures  on  <dig> % xylose, as detailed below.

whole-genome sequencing, assembly and annotation
the genome was sequenced using the gs-flx titanium platform  and the resulting  <dig> kilobase paired-end library of  <dig>  reads was assembled using newbler , resulting in 26-fold coverage and  <dig> contigs, of which  <dig> were joined by newbler into a single large scaffold encompassing 96% of total sequence with  <dig> gaps. remaining contigs represented repetitive sequences . gaps resulting from these repetitive sequences were resolved by in silico gap filling, where contigs generated from a gap-specific assembly were integrated into the circular scaffold with a custom r   <cit>  script . one ambiguous region and one gap remained, with the latter closed by gap edge-specific primer design using primer-blast  followed by bidirectional sanger sequencing of resulting amplicon using the abi <dig> genetic analyzer . origin of replication was determined with originx  <cit> , and the genome was rearranged to start at this position with the chromosomal replication initiator dnaa as the first protein. raw sequencing reads  were submitted to the sequence read archive of ncbi , with accession srx <dig> 

automated gene-calling and functional annotation  was carried out through submission of sequence assembly to joint genome institute’s integrated microbial genomes expert review   <cit> . lignocellulolytic enzymes were identified and categorized by comparison with the carbohydrate-active enzyme  database  <cit> . identification and classification of transporters was carried out initially using the transporter classification function in img/er, which is based on the tcdb database   <cit> . the subset of abc transporters with predicted carbohydrate uptake activity was established through analysis of functional annotations in img/er and further characterized using the abc transporter database   <cit> . functional annotation of well-characterized enzymes was used to create categories for specific metabolic pathways of interest , as previously described  <cit> . hydrogenases and other enzymes important in co-factor recycling and energy balance were identified by homology to known clostridial enzymes  <cit> . nearest neighbour  was established by blast using the ncbi website.

annotated coding sequences were evaluated through submission of draft assembly to geneprimp annotation improvement platform of the joint genome institute   <cit>  to identify long, short, unique, dubious, split or missed genes. automatically generated annotation information was downloaded from img/er to construct the feature file  required for ncbi submission using sort and concatenation functions in excel. manual curation of all automatically generated product names was carried out using ncbi instructions , with further annotation based on database comparisons and sequence improvements using transcriptomic and proteomic data as described below. the .sqn file for ncbi submission was generated using tbl2asn and adjusted through error-reporting, followed by provisional submissions and further error correction. the final closed circle assembly and annotation was approved by ncbi on january  <dig>   <dig> and first public draft released on march  <dig>   <dig> with accession . the refseq accession is . in order to independently confirm specific observations regarding whole genome sequence and specific metabolic pathways, an independently-derived whole genome sequence of the same strain  <cit>  was accessed .

rna-seq transcriptomics and correction of homopolymers
rna was isolated using the chargeswitch magnetic bead-based technique for rna extraction , including dnasei treatment of crude extracts, according to manufacturer’s directions. briefly, total rna was quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd- <dig>  and integrity assessed using a  <dig> bioanalyzer . the ribosomal rna depletion was done using 1 μg of total rna with the metabacteria ribo-zero rrna removal kit . after rrna depletion, remaining rna was purified using the ribominus concentration module , with final elution in 17 μl of “fragment, prime, finish” mix instead of water, followed by fragmenting and priming for cdna synthesis. starting at the “first strand cdna synthesis” step of the protocol for truseq stranded mrna sample prep kit , samples were converted into a library suitable for cluster generation and dna sequencing. library quality was assessed using a labchip and light cycler  <dig> ii  for size and an infinite m <dig> fluorimeter  for quantification. cdna transcripts  were sequenced with the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform by mcgill university and genome quebec innovation center. a total of  <dig>  million reads  with an average phred quality score of  <dig>  were sequenced, with an expected false discovery rate  of  <dig> % based on the quality control plot. raw reads  were pre-processed using a custom script incorporating trimmomatic  with default settings . this algorithm trims adapters, removes leading or trailing low quality and n bases , scans reads in a 4 bp sliding window and cuts when average quality score falls below  <dig>  and removes all reads of less than 36 bp. tophat  <cit>  was used for read alignment based on the reference genome annotation, genome sequence and paired end insertion information. final reads with greater than  <dig> mismatches, gaps or indels were discarded. coverage of the genome sequence by rna-seq transcripts was determined by generating a “base pair map” of the .bam alignment using the bam2depth function in samtools   <cit> . raw illumina sequencing reads in .fastq format were submitted to the sequence read archive of ncbi  with accession srx <dig> 

transcriptomic datasets were compared with the genome sequence in order to correct homopolymer errors in  <dig> pyrosequencing, confirm coding regions and parse improvement suggestions identified through geneprimp and ncbi error reporting. for rna-seq data, individual illumina reads were mapped to the genome sequence using clc genomics workbench , resulting in a list of sequence variants that were manually checked against the mapping of  <dig> reads and further validated in reference to a concurrent genome sequence for this organism   <cit> .

2d-hplc ms/ms proteomics and proteogenomics
protein was extracted from pbs-washed cell pellets by sonication in the presence of detergent, digested using trypsin, cleaned and fractionated as previously described  <cit> . resuspended peptide fractions were subjected to two-dimensional hplc  coupled to tandem mass spectrometry   <cit> , using the tripletof  <dig> platform . results were concatenated from  <dig> lc-ms/ms runs of 70 minutes each and converted from native wiff format to mascot generic format  using the analyst built-in conversion utility. the collision-induced dissociation  spectra in this file were analyzed using x!tandem  against a database of annotated proteins , using the following search settings: fixed modification c +  <dig> ; parent mass error: + −  <dig> ppm; fragment mass error + − <dig>  da. peptides with an expectation value of log < − <dig> were reported  <cit> . in order to determine coverage of the genome by ms/ms peptides, a “base pair map” assigning ion current values to the genome sequence was created using a custom python script . mass spectra  are available at the manitoba centre for proteomics and systems biology global proteome machine server.

proteogenomics analysis was carried out as previously described  <cit> , with the goal of determining whether non-specific hits provide any information about protein coding regions not captured in automatic annotation procedures. an alternative database based on raw  <dig> reads instead of annotated proteins was created. quality information was discarded, and each read transcribed across  <dig> reading frames into peptide-source elements between stop codons only . each element was subjected to an in silico single-missed cleavage tryptic digestion, resulting in a non-redundant proteogenomic peptide database. this collection of peptides was assembled into .fasta format  and analyzed using x!tandem as described above. it is important to note that “proteins” in this database have no connection to actual assembled-annotated proteins. rather, they are collections of connected proteogenomic tryptic peptides for purposes of identifying ms/ms spectra. the results file was parsed into non-redundant member peptides, filtered to exclude peptides containing variable post-translational modifications, and scanned against the genome annotation. unassigned peptides were analyzed using the tblastn function in img/er in order to assign them to potential source proteins in related organisms.

coverage of genome by transcriptome and proteome
coverage of each locus in the genome by rna-seq reads and ms/ms peptides was calculated by comparing base pair maps to gene regions using a custom r script . this analysis also created .fasta files where each base observed in reads/peptides is itself and each base not observed is represented by a dash. to visualize genome coverage, these .fasta files were uploaded along with the genome record  to the gview visualization platform   <cit> , and rendered using the blast atlas function.

RESULTS
whole genome sequence and gene coverage by reads/peptides
a closed genome sequence was generated from a single  <dig> pyrosequencing run, using a novel in silico technique for gap-closing and integration of repetitive regions . wet-lab sequence determination was required for a single gap of  <dig> base pairs only, with one region of  <dig> kilobases containing  <dig> ambiguous bases left unresolved. the final whole genome sequence is  <dig>  megabases, with  <dig>  protein-coding regions and  <dig> non-coding  genes, including  <dig> ribosomal rna,  <dig> transfer rna genes and  <dig> miscellaneous rnas . genome sequence coverage by rna-seq reads and mass spectrometry peptides was extensive. almost all genes . about one-third of protein-coding genes  had no peptide coverage . visualization of transcriptomic and proteomic coverage using gview confirmed even distribution of rna-seq reads and ms/ms peptides across the entire genome .figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig> alternative coding regions were identified by geneprimp and/or ncbi . assembled rna-seq reads were used to identify and correct  <dig> errors in genome sequence data due to inaccurate  <dig> sequencing of homopolymer stretches . several bases identified by rna-seq simply contradicted the genome sequence, indicating error by either method or small-scale mutations in working stocks of lab strains. sequence corrections by rna-seq corroborated five suggested joins and one suggested extension by geneprimp/ncbi . although the remaining differences were not independently confirmed in this study , comparison with a recently-published genome sequence  <cit>  confirmed the majority of corrections suggested by rna-seq .table  <dig>

proteogenomic confirmation of genome annotation
by comparing the proteogenomic database to annotated proteins, our analysis yielded  <dig>  peptides aligning with annotated proteins and  <dig> peptides that did not align  < −1). the confidence of peptide sequence assignment was further strengthened by comparing computed hydrophobicity versus retention time  . correlation of hydrophobicity and retention time for unassigned peptides was much weaker . of this collection, only two peptides  were found in the same reading frame with nearby coordinates, indicating that they identified a missed protein in the annotation. these peptides were found to align with similar coordinates in the c. thermocellum dsm <dig> protein a3dji <dig> . one peptide  supported an alternate reading frame that was also identified by geneprimp. this analysis provides observational support for annotation modifications suggested in the genome improvement workflow . two more peptides in this collection  supported 5’ extensions of annotated proteins that were not suggested by geneprimp. correlation of hydrophobicity/retention time for these five “proteogenomic” peptides was similar to assigned peptides . although these observations were not independently confirmed, they are corroborated by the annotation of the alternate genome for this organism  <cit> .figure  <dig>

corroboration of pseudogenes
a total of  <dig> genes identified as pseudogenes in the automatic annotation or through the genome improvement pipeline were found to have no peptides associated with them under the culture conditions in this study and were identified as such in the final annotated genome. two other loci  were found to have at least some peptide coverage  and were not annotated as pseudogenes. most of the suggested alternatives by geneprimp/ncbi  were identified as pseudogenes, however all alternatives corroborated by rna-seq/proteogenomic analysis were not . these included three suggested gene joins  that were initially predicted to be pseudogenes, but had at least some coverage by peptides  and were found to have intact reading frames once rna-seq corrections were applied. three other cases of suggested gene joins resulting in putative pseudogenes  were covered by peptides  and were not joined in the final annotation. blast analysis was also performed in order to ensure that peptides observed for putative pseudogenes with peptide coverage were not misattributed due to presence of orthologous genes in the genome. given inherent biases and contrasts between different gene-calling and annotation improvement algorithms, further in-depth proteomics analysis of sequenced organisms under different culture conditions will be required to test whether annotated pseudogenes are actually coding regions.

carbohydrate-active enzymes
a total of  <dig> genes encoding proteins with predicted activity on carbohydrates were identified through the cazy database, including  <dig> glycoside hydrolases ,  <dig> glycosyltransferases ,  <dig> carbohydrate esterases ,  <dig> polysaccharide lyases  and  <dig> genes with carbohydrate-binding motifs /surface layer homology  domains only . gh enzymes from  <dig> different cazy families were observed. seventeen of these proteins, incuding  <dig> gh enzymes, were modular with multiple catalytic regions and/or one or more cbm/slh domains. these results confirm  <dig> previously sequenced biomass-degrading enzymes identified for this organism, including cellulases , cellobiose phosphorylases , xylanases , xylosidases , arabinofuranosidases , a galactosidase , a pectate lyase  and an α-rhamnosidase  . peptides were observed for 85/ <dig> or 81% of genes in this category, with highest peptide coverage  of previously described genes for arfb, bglz, cepb and bxla .

glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway
with the exception of transaldolase, all genes with functional annotations associated with central glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways were observed in the genome. three phosphofructokinases  were annotated and all had some coverage by peptides , while only  <dig> out of  <dig> annotated phosphoglucomutases  were observed in the proteome. extensive coverage of xylose isomerase  and xylose kinase  by peptides was observed, indicating pentose utilization by this organism . only one of two annotated copies of the transketolase a and b genes were observed in the proteome . although glucose phosphate dehydrogenase  converting glucose-6p to gluconolactone-6p was observed, neither gene annotated as phosphoglucolactonase  had any associated peptides under these culture conditions, indicating a possible alternative source of 6p-d-gluconate for d-ribulose-5p synthesis. no known transaldolase  was observed in the genome or through proteogenomic analysis, indicating the existence of an alternative pathway for sedoheptulose-7p  degradation in the pentose phosphate pathway.figure  <dig>

several potential pathways for pep/pyruvate conversion were observed, including pyruvate kinase , pyruvate dikinase , pep decarboxykinase  in combination with the malate dehydrogenase/malic enzyme  shunt, or oxaloacetate  . conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coa may occur through two pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductases  or pyruvate dehydrogenase complex , all of which were observed in the proteome. the bifunctional type iv alcohol/acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , a single aldehyde dehydrogenase  and  <dig> alcohol dehydrogenases  were observed with varying levels of peptide coverage. lactate hydrogenase  and phosphoacetyltransferase/acetate kinase  were also observed in the genome and proteome. oxoglutarate synthesis from oxaloacetate via citrate/isocitrate was also indicated by observation of the required enzymes in the proteome .figure  <dig>

confirmation of end products predicted through pathway analysis
in order to confirm function of lignocellulolytic, transport and central metabolic pathways, c. stercorarium dsm8532t was cultured on cellobiose, xylose and xylan  and harvested at mid-exponential phase . results confirmed growth on xylan consistent with the presence of several xylanolytic enzymes . profile of observed end products  is consistent with the presence of required enzymes in pyruvate conversion pathways, while detection of hydrogen in gas phase is consistent with hydrogenases and oxidoreductases detected in this organism. growth on xylose is consistent with presence of a known xylose transporter  and an intact pentose phosphate pathway. given absence of transaldolase in the genome, alternative pathways for degradation of sedoheptulose-7p  are proposed .figure  <dig>

discussion
we report a complete genome sequence for c. stercorarium dsm8532t, generated using a single sequencing platform and in silico gap-filling. this approach represents a significant advance and savings in wet-lab procedures for gap-closing, however a key requirement of the in silico technique is complete coverage of the genome by sequencing reads . validation of the approach was provided by the recent release of a concurrent sequence where extensive wet-lab gap-closing was applied  <cit> . although a comparison of the two versions is beyond the scope of this study, a preliminary analysis indicates very few differences between the two, mostly found in an ambiguous region of our sequence.

genome-wide studies increasingly employ complementary omics data in order to improve annotation and provide enhanced insight into bacterial metabolism . we report extensive coverage of the genome by transcripts and peptides using updated techniques . complete coverage of virtually all genes by rna-seq reads may indicate a background level of transcription for the entire genome. although dnasei treatment of cell extracts was performed, some residual dna was observed in the rna prep using fluorometric assays, and may have been sequenced at a background level  <cit> . therefore, further work will be required to ensure absence of dna or subtraction of background signal. despite this limitation, rna-seq data were effectively applied to improve the genome sequence and correct homopolymer errors resulting from  <dig> sequencing, corroborating several suggestions for sequence changes proposed by the genome annotation improvement pipeline geneprimp and ncbi prior to sequence submission. our results indicate that illumina rna-seq for wgs improvement may supplant illumina dna sequencing for this purpose  <cit> , since genome coverage using rna prepared as described in this study was sufficient to correct the majority of the homopolymer errors, even in non-coding regions.

proteogenomic analysis resulted in several suggested improvements to the genome sequence, corroborating an inserted gene and an alternative reading frame suggested by geneprimp, as well as probable gene extensions not captured by other genome improvement procedures. overall, proteogenomic analysis indicates the quality of the automated genome annotation in that only two cases of previously unannotated genes were observed, both of which were also highlighted through geneprimp.

most of the genome improvements suggested by geneprimp and/or ncbi resulted in putative pseudogenes. however, a subset of suggestions  were not identified as pseudogenes and half of these  were corroborated by rna-seq or proteogenomic analysis. this finding indicates that genome improvement suggestions by geneprimp or ncbi algorithms may be more reliable when not resulting in pseudogenes. an increased effort by bioinformaticians to identify erroneous pseudogenes in existing databases would be desirable, confirming the importance of using multiple data sources to improve genome annotation. further, observation of peptides through proteomics provides direct insight into whether a particular coding region should or should not be defined as a pseudogene. although only a single culture condition was used in this study, most coding regions defined as pseudogenes had no peptides observed, corroborating automatic annotation by img/er, geneprimp and/or ncbi.

since the purpose of this study was an improved whole genome sequence and annotation, we included all data meeting minimum quality standards to determine coverage of gene regions by rna-seq and ms/ms proteomics data. further work will be required to determine dna contamination and/or background noise related to rna-seq  <cit> . high-throughput proteomics of hplc-fractionated peptides in this study has provided exceptional depth of coding region coverage, comparable to other in-depth studies  <cit> . however, signals generated by different proteomics and transcriptomics platforms may be biased by a number of factors  <cit> . for example, samples are from cultures growing on hexose  or pentose , and cannot be strictly compared due to undetermined effects on the regulatory milieu, gene expression, relative abundance of transporters and branching central metabolic pathways more generally  <cit> . further work will be required to determine the relation of these terms to cellular metabolism and each other as technologies to measure them continue to evolve  <cit> .

lignocellulolytic enzymes are the only previously well-characterized components of c. stercorarium dsm8532t metabolism. in this study, some of the most important predicted cellulases were not detected in the proteome. many lignocellulolytic enzymes encode transmembrane domains , signal peptides  or both . since proteomic profiles were generated from cell pellets growing on soluble sugars, detection of this enzyme class may be limited due to presence in culture supernatants only or possible lack of expression in the absence of lignocellulosic material  <cit> . further studies on complex substrates such as cellulose or hemicellulose will be required to determine their relative importance in lignocelluloysis. although many of this organism’s nearest phylogenetic  neighbours are cellulosome-encoders, celyz of c. stercorarium most closely resembles a similar pair in c. phytofermentans, another cellulolytic organism without cellulosome. homologous enzymes containing cellulosomal dockerin domains are grouped together with another cellulase and adjoining cellulolosomal scaffoldin in c. papyrosolvens and c. cellulolyticum, while homologs are also present as non-dockerin-containing enzymes in c. thermocellum, although vastly separated from each other on the chromosome. these observations indicate the complex interweaving and reiteration of coding sequences across phylogenetically close but functionally divergent organisms, providing insight into horizontal gene transfer and small replicon-mediated evolution.

all but one abc-type cut cluster contained transmembrane and solute-binding components only, an arrangement frequently observed in gram-positive organisms  <cit> . we focused on a subset of  <dig> cut clusters where every gene in the cluster was detected by ms/ms. most clusters consisted of  <dig> transmembrane genes  and a single solute-binding gene  with clostridial homologues in c. termitidis, c. phytofermentans, c. papyrosolvens and thermoanaerobacterium xylanolyticum. surprisingly, several genes in these clusters, including clst_0194- <dig>  had near neighbours in treponema , an otherwise distantly-related spirochaete. the nearest homologue for the nucleotide-binding gene was from c. thermocellum . the single cut <dig> cluster was homologous to the known xylose transporter xylfgh of thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus and the newly described t. thermohydrosulfuricus wc <dig>  <cit> .

xylose transport and utilization by this organism confirms the importance of the pentose phosphate pathway, however lack of a known encoded transaldolase , indicates an alternative pathway for s-7p degradation. two possibilities are proposed, the first involving one of three encoded phosphofructokinases  and a bifunctional fructose bisphosphate aldolase   <cit>  . recently, “forcing” this degradation in a transaldolase-knockout strain of e. coli may have occurred due to accumulation of s-7p, followed by creation of sedoheptulose  <dig> -2p and cleavage to dihydroxyacetone-p  and erythrose-4p  by pfk and fba respectively  <cit> . of  <dig> clostridia with whole genomes in img,  <dig>  do not have an annotated transaldolase, however few previous studies have shown xylose utilization by confirmed transaldolase-deficient strains  <cit> . annotated pfk genes may have distinct biological roles and use either pyrophosphate or atp as a phosphate donor  <cit> , therefore, we hypothesize that one of three pfk may be involved specifically in transformation of s-7p to s- <dig> -2p. an alternative hypothesis is that expression of 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase  from the shikimate pathway creates a s-7p-like molecule from pep and glyceraldehyde-3p  and might catalyze the degradation of s-7p to pep and g-3p during xylose utilization . further work will be required to define these potentially significant observations for pentose utilization in clostridia.

muliple pathways for pep/pyruvate conversion and co-factor recycling are consistent with previous literature on thermophilic clostridia  <cit>  and demonstrated end products for this organism during anaerobic culture. all expressed clusters are likely to contribute to hydrogen production and nadh oxidation, including a bifurcating nadh-fd hydrogenase   <cit>  with similarity to the designated bifurcating hydrogenase in c. thermocellum atcc  <dig>  and a dimeric three-way oxidoreductase involving nadh, ferredoxin and nadp   <cit> . further study will be required to determine which pathways are most highly expressed and how they are regulated during metabolism, resulting in observed end product profiles for c. stercorarium on cellobiose, xylose and xylan. these profiles largely confirm previous culture-based literature  <cit> , including generally elevated production of ethanol relative to lactate and acetate. further testing of the robustness and reproducibility of molecular techniques in relation to culture-based parameters will help to determine a theoretical baseline of expected values for mid-exponential cells, linking expression profiles to strain performance in terms of efficient substrate utilization and ethanol production.

CONCLUSIONS
we report a finished wgs for this well-characterized type strain in the context of detailed information about coverage of annotated gene regions using illumina rna-seq and high-throughput 2d ms/ms. to our knowledge, this is the first time a wgs has been enhanced using these advanced techniques. our approach may represent an updated model for better definition of the molecular systems biology of an organism in an era where wgs have proliferated rapidly. understanding the influence of environmental factors on expression of inter-connected enzymatic pathways will be critical to evaluate and improve ethanol production by selected organisms and consortia in consolidated bioprocessing.
