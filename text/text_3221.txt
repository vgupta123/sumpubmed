BACKGROUND
structural genomic rearrangements, also known as structural variants , contribute significantly to human disease and variation with locus-specific mutation rates 100- to  <dig> -fold higher than for single nucleotide variation  <cit> . svs include deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations, and can generally be categorized as recurrent or non-recurrent. recurrent svs are characterized by virtually identical size and clustered breakpoints, whereas the breakpoints of non-recurrent svs are more variably located throughout the genome  <cit> . the vast majority of the described recurrent deletions and duplications occur by non-allelic homologous recombination  between directly oriented low-copy repeats , also known as segmental duplications.

lcrs  occupy approximately 5% of the human reference genome   <cit> . lcrs mediating nahr are typically 10 kb or longer and are over 95% identical to one or more other loci  <cit> . despite the observation that most recurrent svs are due to nahr between lcrs, there have also been sporadic reports of recurrent svs not flanked by lcrs. for example, recurrent translocations can be mediated by at-rich palindromic repeats  <cit> . another class of genomic features that may mediate nahr events are repetitive elements, including long interspersed elements  and human endogenous retroviruses   <cit> .

together, lines and hervs constitute over 25% of the hrg  <cit> . although the vast majority of these elements are fragments of the full-length element , they present a considerably larger target for mutagenic processes. indeed, a number of human diseases are associated with deletion alleles where both breakpoints map within line elements  <cit> . in contradistinction to line elements, relatively fewer recurrent structural rearrangements mediated by hervs have been described. the best studied examples are recurrent deletions and duplications of yq <dig> , the former conveying complete germ-cell aplasia   <cit> . these copy-number variations  are caused by apparent intrachromosomal nahr between herv-i elements and can be identified at low levels in sperm samples from normal donors  <cit> . for two unrelated patients, the breakpoints of recurrent t translocations were determined by sequencing to occur within herv-h elements  <cit> . similarly, for two unrelated patients it has been suggested that the apparently same-sized 1q41q <dig> deletions are mediated by herv  <cit> . recently, we identified a recurrent deletion of 3q <dig> q <dig>  in nine unrelated patients, each with breakpoints located in herv-h elements  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that an as-of-yet undescribed class of recurrent structural rearrangements arise via nahr between repetitive elements genome-wide.

herv elements   <cit>  make up approximately  <dig> % of the hrg and are considered the scars of viral infections and genomic integration events in the germ-line cells of our distant ancestors  <cit> . all  contain sequence variants, deletions or insertions that render them incapable of transposition or infection. despite the preponderance of inactivating mutations, phylogenetic studies suggest that herv elements continue to undergo extensive inter-element recombination  <cit> . we hypothesized that analysis of the sequence characteristics and distribution of herv elements throughout the genome would allow us to predict regions that are potentially susceptible to herv-mediated cnvs.

RESULTS
computational prediction of herv elements prone to recombination events
given previous studies of nahr events, we hypothesized that directly oriented repetitive elements with high sequence identity could mediate recurrent deletions and reciprocal duplications. to this end, we searched for highly homologous pairs of herv elements using repeatmasker, allowing for small gaps between annotations . we identified  <dig> such herv pairs fitting our parameters genome-wide , with the largest number on chromosome  <dig>  with  <dig> pairs .

genome-wide map of herv mediated instability
the  <dig> overlapping pairs that we predicted can be condensed into  <dig> susceptibility regions . overall, we estimate that 375 mb  of the hrg could potentially undergo herv-mediated cnv. this predicted susceptibility, genome-wide, is considerably more than the 9% predicted by sharp et al.  <cit>  and the 6% predicted by liu et al.  <cit>  for cnvs mediated by nahr between lcrs. chromosome  <dig> was determined to have the largest fraction of reference sequences within susceptibility regions as a percentage of chromosome length .

potential herv-mediated copy-number variations
given our list of herv susceptibility regions, we hypothesized that interrogation of our clinical cnv databases would reveal potential herv-mediated cnvs in patients. thus, we cross-referenced the cnv results from  <dig>  patients referred for chromosomal microarray analysis at medical genetics laboratories of baylor college of medicine  and signature genomic laboratories by oligonucleotide-based microarrays with coverage for a majority but not all of the susceptibility regions. overall,  <dig> cnvs between  <dig> herv pairs were seen in the combined databases . as expected, 1q41q <dig>  <cit> , 3q <dig> q <dig>  <cit>  and 8q <dig>   <cit>  deletions were identified. the remaining  <dig> cnvs were flanked by  <dig> herv pairs and ranged in size from 167 kb to  <dig>  mb with eight of the pairs being observed more than once. notably, multiple deletions and the reciprocal duplications were identified at four separate loci. the most common finding was a likely benign 160-kb deletion  and duplication  on 10p <dig>  involving part of a single gene for a noncoding rna.figure  <dig>

molecular analysis of predicted herv-mediated copy-number variations
to test whether the cnvs identified in patients were in fact mediated by herv elements, we mapped the cnv breakpoints by pcr and sanger sequencing. we chose to select cnvs containing refseq genes to increase potential medical relevance and focused on loci seen more than once to increase our odds of true positives. we attempted to map deletions and duplications at 2p <dig>  and 11q <dig> , a duplication at 2p <dig> , as well as to map the previously suspected 1q <dig> deletions  <cit> . overall, we tested dna from ten individuals . we designed primers based on the predicted herv elements such that a cnv-specific junction fragment could be amplified . in each case, we detected the predicted junction fragment, which was subsequently confirmed by sanger sequencing . patients tested with the same primer pairs had identically sized junction fragments, as would be expected with aligned repeats mediating an nahr event .

breakpoint analysis
our previous analyses of nine patients with herv-mediated deletions of 3q <dig> q <dig>  showed that patients with de novo recurrent herv-mediated cnvs have different breakpoints  <cit> . since the parents of the patients with cnvs of 1q <dig>  2p <dig> and 11q <dig> that we tested in this study were unavailable, breakpoint analysis gave us the opportunity to determine that these cnvs arose as independent events. single nucleotide or indel differences  between the herv retrotransposons enabled narrowing of the regions where the crossover event occurred to between  <dig> and 162 bp . in each case, the patient’s breakpoint region was different, excepting two patients with 2p <dig> deletions who were known to be siblings.table  <dig>

herv elements and breakpoint distribution
we were interested in investigating the structure of the retroviral elements mediating the cnvs and the positions of the breakpoints at each locus. to this end, we multiply aligned the sequence of each herv element with its partner and the full-length consensus herv-h sequence from repbase  <cit>  . we repeated the same process at each locus tested in this study as well as for the autosomal loci previously reported. the herv-h elements observed to mediate cnvs have a strikingly similar pattern of internal deletions, perhaps due to a master gene model of amplification  <cit> . although 90% of herv-h elements lack env sequences  <cit> , the elements mediating cnvs additionally contain small xx and yy domain deletions, indicating a potentially close evolutionary relationship. each element has two intact long tandem repeat  sequences flanking the internal viral sequence. additionally, each has one or more large deletions of the env gene consistent with previous analysis of herv-h sequences genome-wide  <cit> .

breakpoint clustering
visual inspection suggested that breakpoints of cnvs occurring between the same herv elements are clustered in the same region . we hypothesized that this clustering is not explained by merely being confined to highly identical regions. to test this, we used a monte carlo approach to sample potential breakpoint positions randomly in regions of high identity . our analysis of the 11q <dig> locus revealed that breakpoints occur clustered more than by random chance . the same analysis performed for 1q <dig> , 2p <dig>  and for previously determined 3q <dig> q <dig>  breakpoints  identified similar clustering.figure  <dig>

we were interested in assessing sequence features that could explain the observed clustering of breakpoints in herv elements. previous investigation of homologous recombination hotspots revealed a sequence motif that promotes prdm <dig>  binding and explains much of the increased rate of recombination  <cit> . investigation of recurrent nahr-mediated cnvs in patients identified a correlation between cnv frequency and the same motif  <cit> . we hypothesized that such recombination hotspot motifs might also be associated with the breakpoint clusters observed in the herv elements. assessment of the herv element sequences revealed hotspot motifs located near the breakpoint clusters . statistical analyses of the breakpoint clusters  revealed that they are significantly enriched in hotspots . the original hotspot analysis reported that a number of repetitive elements, including members of the line and alu families, are enriched in hotspot motifs  <cit> . the  <dig> autosomal herv-h elements observed to mediate cnvs  have significantly higher densities of prdm <dig> hotspot motifs than the genome-wide average . the densities of hotspot motifs among the herv-h elements observed to mediate cnvs, however, are not significantly different from the  <dig> other herv-h elements with intact ltrs throughout the genome.

herv-mediated copy-number variations in healthy individuals
given that we identified likely benign cnvs of 10p <dig> that are mediated by herv elements in multiple individuals in our clinical cohorts, some of which were inherited from an apparently healthy parent, we hypothesized that other herv pairs may contribute to normal genomic variation in healthy individuals. to explore this hypothesis, we designed a custom comparative genomic hybridization array  with probes flanking the herv elements computationally predicted to contribute to genome instability . we tested six healthy subjects for cnvs mediated by these herv elements but failed to identify any predicted cnvs. larger studies of healthy subjects will be required to investigate further the contribution of herv-mediated cnvs to phenotypically neutral genomic variation.

discussion
our combined bioinformatic prediction and molecular biology approach suggests that herv-mediated structural rearrangements occur throughout the genome. the observation that a number of our predicted and all of our molecularly confirmed cnvs contain refseq genes as well as a number of online mendelian inheritance in man  genes implies that these rearrangements have an effect on human health. based upon the observation that breakpoints of events at the same locus in unrelated individuals occur at slightly different locations, we conclude that these cnvs arose as independent events rather than being inherited from a common ancestor. the identification of deletions and reciprocal duplications mediated by herv elements and their association with recombination hotspot motifs further strengthens the hypothesis that these cnvs arise via nahr. we suspect that some herv-mediated cnvs continue to arise in the population. however, some more common herv-mediated cnvs identified in our study  are likely to be present and segregating in the healthy population.

in addition to providing insight into a potentially new type of human recurrent structural rearrangement, our data also shed light on the substrates mediating nahr. cell culture experiments show that nahr events require stretches of extreme homology or complete identity between non-allelic loci know as minimal efficient processing segments   <cit> . estimates for mep length in humans range from  <dig> to 500 bp  <cit> . base mismatches and indels that interrupt the stretches of sequence identity negatively affect the efficiency of nahr. in mice, the presence of two nucleotide mismatches results in an approximate 20-fold decrease in nahr rate  <cit> . as is clear from the uncertainty regions for our patients’ breakpoints ,  <dig> to 500 bp of uninterrupted identity is not present. extended analysis of the aligned sequences of the herv elements at each breakpoint reveals a number of sequence variants and even multiple base deletions and insertions . recent analysis of nahr in humans suggests the efficiency of recombination is correlated with lcr length  <cit> .

although the forces described above would tend to oppose nahr between herv elements, we have previously identified nine events at a single locus   <cit>  and molecularly confirmed nine events throughout the genome in this study. interestingly, the herv-mediated events at 3q <dig>  a previously identified translocation ), and those described in this manuscript are all mediated by herv-h elements. this could be largely due to the abundance of full-length herv-h elements in the genome; herv-h comprises approximately one-third of all pol-containing herv elements in the reference sequence  <cit> .

dittwald and colleagues  <cit>  identified  <dig>  known pathogenic lcr-mediated cnvs from  <dig>  individuals sent for chromosomal microarray analysis at a diagnostic lab . meanwhile, approximately  <dig> %  of individuals in this study harbor herv-mediated cnvs, although considerably different methods were used in each analysis. the rarity of herv-mediated cnvs compared to classical lcr-mediated cnvs, despite the greater fraction of the genome potentially susceptible to herv-mediated cnvs, could suggest that herv elements provide less efficient meps. sperm pcr analysis estimated the de novo mutation rate of the herv-mediated yq <dig>  deletion to be approximately 2 × 10− <dig> per generation, as for other nahr events  <cit> . thus, the apparently lower rate of herv-mediated cnvs genome-wide may be due to other factors. an alternative hypothesis would be that the cnvs identified for our patients are best explained by errors in dna replication such as those proposed in the fork stalling and template switching   <cit>  and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication   <cit>  models. under such a hypothesis, the herv sequences would serve as microhomology substrates to facilitate a template switch during dna replication. however, no recurrent cnvs mediated by fostes or mmbir have been reported, nor have reciprocal deletions and duplications been described.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we have shown that structural variation between herv elements occurs throughout the genome. given the reciprocal nature of the cnvs and association with recombination hotspots, they most likely occurred via nahr. because herv elements  provide both sequence identity and enrichment in hotspot motifs, we believe that they contribute substantially to genome instability and human disease. although we were unable to identify herv-mediated cnvs for six healthy subjects, herv elements may also contribute to normal genomic variation in the population. line-line mediated cnvs have been anecdotally reported in the literature, although no systematic study of cnvs mediated by this much more abundant repetitive element are available. nonetheless, we suspect lines, and indeed any repetitive element that provides the key features of homology and hotspot motifs, also promote cnv. these repeats represent an exciting area for future research.
