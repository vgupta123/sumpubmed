BACKGROUND
the pivotal role that the prion protein  plays in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  is now well established . the conversion of this host-encoded protein to an abnormal, partially proteinase k resistant, isoform is a hallmark of most tses and prp is the only known constituent of mammalian prions  <cit> . the prnp gene that encodes for prp, is expressed in a broad range of vertebrate tissues but most abundantly in the central nervous system  <cit> .

although prp is evolutionary conserved, suggesting that it has an important role, its physiological function remains unclear even though its implication in neuroprotection, response to oxidative stress, cell proliferation and differentiation, synaptic function and signal transduction has been proposed  <cit> . its temporal regulation led also to suspect an implication of this protein in early embryogenesis  <cit>  but prnp-knockout mice  <cit> , cattle  <cit>  and goat  <cit>  were obtained with no drastic developmental phenotype and only subtle alterations of their circadian rhythm, hippocampal function and of their behavior. a similar observation was made when this gene was invalidated in adult neurons  <cit> . to explain these data, it was hypothesized that another host-encoded protein is able to compensate for the lack of prp  <cit> . however, this protein has not yet been identified.

transcriptomic analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to decipher cellular pathways that are modified following a gene expression alteration as it does not pre-require the need of restricting hypothesis. such approaches have been conducted to analyze the mechanisms underlying prion replication and neurotoxicity . the obtained results appeared however inconsistent and closely related to the cell type and/or strain and animal model used, leading to difficulties in identifying the metabolic pathways involved.

fewer studies have used a similar approach to try to understand the biological function of the prp protein in immortalized non-neuronal cells  <cit> . the obtained results appear again to correlate with the cell line used as experimental model and no shared pathway has emerged from the comparison of these different experiments. in parallel, proteomic studies have been conducted either using two cell lines  <cit>  or transgenic knockout mice  <cit> . while different sets of proteins were found to be affected by the prp expression level in cells according to their origin, no significant difference was detected in the brain proteome of the analyzed 129/sv-c57/bl <dig> transgenic mice, bearing in mind that variations occurring for low abundant proteins might not have been detected  <cit> .

in the present study, we report the comparisons of the whole brain transcriptomes of prp knockout or wild type mice, both on an fvb/n genetic background, and of that of mice invalidated for the prnp locus in adult neurons.

RESULTS
comparative transcriptional analysis of fvb/n versus fvb/n prnp-/- mouse brains
a search for differentially expressed genes was done by comparison of the expression profiles of fvb/n versus fvb/n prnp-/-  <cit>  mouse brains. to this aim, rna samples were prepared by pooling rnas from  <dig> brains of 6-week old mice of each genotype. after statistical analysis, two genes were found to be differentially expressed, including the prnp one . the relatively low log ratio observed for the variation in prnp expression is explained by the fact that the knockout experiment was done in such a way that the gene remains expressed although at a lower level, around  <dig> to  <dig> fold, as observed by northern blotting , but that the resulting mrna does not encode for prp anymore  <cit> .

differentially expressed genes detected by the microarray analysis are listed with the calculated differential ratio  alongside the observed delta-delta ct resulting from the qpcr experiment. the comparative ct method is known as the  <dig> ct method, where delta delta ct = ct, sample - ct, reference

qpcr was applied to confirm the suspected differential expression of the detected genes using the same pools of brain rnas. both prnp and scg <dig> differential expression were confirmed . the higher relative fold-change observed by qpcr for the prnp gene compared to that detected in the micro-array experiment is related to the location of the used primers in exon  <dig> and in exon  <dig> of the prp-encoding gene respectively, which will not amplify the retro-transcribed rna expressed by the invalidated locus.

the scg <dig> encodes the 7b <dig> neuroendocrine secretory protein, a specific chaperone for the proprotein convertase  <dig>  <cit> . invalidation of this gene leads to a hypersecretion of cortocitropin that induces early lethality. this protein function was of interest in regards with prp since hypercorticism is a phenotype associated with scrapie in ewes  <cit> . however, a search in the mouse genome database for the chromosomal localization of the prnp and scg <dig> loci revealed that these two genes are physically linked and only  <dig> cm apart. it has been reported that the level of expression of 7b <dig>  at least in the pancreas, differs between mouse strains and is related to a genetic polymorphism that occurs within its proximal promoter  <cit> . since the prnp knockout was done on 129/sv es cells, we hypothesized that the scg <dig> gene could still be of a 129/sv genetic origin in fvb/n prnp-/- mice while it is of fvb/n genetic origin in wild-type mice. we amplified by pcr and sequenced the -200/- <dig> scg <dig> promoter region starting from genomic dna of three fvb/n, 129/sv and fvb/n prnp-/- mice, respectively. a single nucleotide polymorphism  could be detected at position - <dig> that discriminates between the fvb/n and the 129/sv or fvb/n prnp-/- genotypes . these results thus indicate that in the fvb/n prnp-/- mice, the scg <dig> locus remains of 129/sv genetic origin. it is worth mentioning that the detected single nucleotide polymorphism abolishes a putative aml 1a transcription factor binding site, tggggt, in the fvb/n scg <dig> promoter possibly explaining the different levels of expression observed. altogether, these data suggest that the brain scg <dig> differential expression between the fvb/n and fvb/n prnp-/- mice results from a different genetic origin of this locus.

the sequences were obtained from three independent mice of each genotype. the sequences are numbered backward starting from the reported distal-most transcription initiation site  <cit> . the observed single nucleotide polymorphism is indicated in bold-faced type.

the observed poor transcriptional alteration in the brain of mouse depleted for prp could suggest that these animals adapted to this genetic environment during embryogenesis. if such, invalidation of the prp-encoding gene at an adult stage might induce detectable transient modification of the genome transcriptomic regulation. using already validated conditional knockout transgenic lines  <cit> , we analyzed the potential impact of an adult neuronal prp depletion on the overall brain transcriptome.

incidence of a post-natal neuronal prp depletion on the brain transcriptome
this experiment was performed using tg <dig> mice, transgenic mice expressing physiological levels of mouse prp from a transgene composed of a the floxed coding sequences inserted within the hamster-based cosshatet expression vector, crossed with nfh-cre transgenic mice  <cit> . both transgenic mice were under a mouse prnp-knockout genetic background. the brain rna pools consisted of littermates of  <dig> males and  <dig> females of either  <dig> or  <dig> weeks old for each tg37+/- nfh-cre-/- or tg37+/- nfh-cre+/- genotypes. these two ages were chosen since activation of the nfh promoter results in ablation of prp in neurons after  <dig> weeks  <cit> . after statistical analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed at  <dig>  or  <dig>  weeks, respectively. at  <dig> weeks,  <dig> genes were over-expressed and  <dig> under-expressed in prnp depleted mice as compared with the nfh-cre-negative control animals. at  <dig> weeks,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were over-expressed or under-expressed, respectively. because the oligonucleotide that recognized prnp in the microarray is located within the 3' utr of the gene, a region poorly conserved, it was not expected to detect expression of the tg <dig> transgene that encompasses the hamster prnp 3'utr sequence and indeed differential expression of this gene was not revealed. the absence of the scg <dig> locus within the detected differentially expressed genes further supports the above hypothesis that explains its detection in the previous experiment by a physical link between the scg <dig> and the prnp loci rather than by a functional one.

qpcr was applied to confirm the microarray results for the genes suspected differentially expressed with the observed highest log <dig> ratios, using the same pools of brain rnas and to assess the cre-induced prnp invalidation . this latter point was confirmed at both  <dig> and  <dig> weeks with a highly significant knockdown of the tg37-transgene expression in the brain of tg37-nfh-cre transgenic mice. the down-regulation observed is less important than that detected in fvb/n prnp-/- mice which is an expected result since the cre deletion is limited to the neurons, due to the tissue-specificity of the nfh promoter. the slight difference observed between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks might suggest that at  <dig> weeks, the deletion process is not fully complete. the percentage of brain cells that have a deleted tg <dig> transgene following cre activation was previously estimated to be around  <dig> - 37%  <cit> . our data suggest that these cells are among those that express the transgene the most.

differentially expressed genes detected by the microarray analysis are listed with the calculated differential ratio  alongside the observed delta-delta ct resulting from the qpcr experiment. the comparative ct method is known as the  <dig> - ct method, where delta delta ct = ct, sample - ct, reference. age of the analyzed mice is mentioned.

the microarray data were confirmed for  <dig> out of  <dig> analyzed genes . among the non-confirmed genes is the above mentioned av <dig>  putative gene. this gene, located in mouse chromosome  <dig> and/or mouse chromosome  <dig>  encodes for a hypothetical protein, and its transcription was only reported as an est in es cells. the non-confirmation of the differential expression of this gene was surprising since its estimated log ratio was relatively high. blast alignment of the microarray oligonucleotide corresponding to this gene allowed us to design primers that recognized a family of mouse ests that encompass this sequence . however, this oligonucleotide aligns with various regions of the mouse genome , located on several chromosomes, and we therefore cannot exclude that a transcript, originating from one of these regions, that will not be amplified by our set of primers is responsible for the observed differential expression. although showing a down-regulated expression in tg37+/- nfh-cre+/- mice in both the micro-array analysis and the qpcr experiment, the ratio observed by qpcr was relatively lower than could be expected for the ifitm <dig> gene. the primers used for the qpcr were chosen in order not to amplify the other ifitm gene family mrnas . however, they share some homology with the ankyrin repeat domain  <dig>  which might interfere with the obtained results. the other non-confirmed genes correspond to differentially expressed genes showing very low log <dig> ratios on the microarray results, between - <dig>  and +  <dig> . overall the qpcr obtained data for these genes strengthen the relative transcriptomic stability of the prnp knockout brain. the microarray and qpcr data were consistent for the erf <dig> transcriptional deregulation . we further analyzed the expression level of this gene in the brain of prnp-knockout mice expressing or not the nfh-cre transgene. no difference was observed , demonstrating that the cre expression does not significantly influence the expression profile of this locus and thus that its observed deregulation in our experiment results from the prnp invalidation. although we cannot formally exclude that some of the other deregulated genes listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> results from the cre expression, this data strongly suggest that the neuronal prp depletion is responsible for the observed transcriptional modifications.

the sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the qpcr experiments are listed; including those of the housekeeping gene that was used in the three described analyses. the sets of primers for the erf <dig>  glrx <dig>  bb <dig>  and the av <dig>  loci were designed within a single exon. all the other sets were designed over exon-exon borders.

the log ratios observed for the other detected differentially expressed genes were relatively low. however, it has to be kept in mind that this invalidation only involved neuronal cells, and probably not all of them  <cit> , and thus that transcriptomic modifications occurring within this cell population will be diluted by the heterogeneous cell composition of the analyzed adult brain tissues. it could also suggest that the biological relevance of the observed variation is doubtful. only  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed at both stages, kcnj <dig>  1810030j14rik and synaptotagmin  <dig> , of which only 1810030j14rik was found to behave similarly between these two time-points. this apparent discrepancy could be explained when the function of the differentially express genes was further analyzed, either using the ingenuity pathways analysis or by looking at the expression pattern and putative functions attributed to those genes . at  <dig> weeks, the detected genes appear to reflect a cellular response to an oxidative stress , which is in phase with putative physiological functions attributed to prp  <cit> . some of the detected genes also suggest that at that stage, the prp depletion might induce damaged synaptic trafficking and cell death, two cellular pathways into which prp is also suspected to have a role . at  <dig> weeks, the differentially expressed genes are rather evocative of a remodeling of the nervous system . most of the identified genes are indeed involved in cellular development and neuronal differentiation. the stage-specific modulation of the kcnj <dig> and synaptotagmin ii are in agreement with this proposed scenario. so although a few genes are found to be differentially expressed with low detected log ratios, the functions of these genes appear relevant and consistent.

overall, our data suggest that invalidation of the prnp gene does not induce gross modification of the adult mouse brain transcriptome. when this event happens a few days before the analysis is performed, we cannot however exclude that the few moderately differentially expressed genes that are then detected indicate a physiological prp role in adult neuronal homeostasis, synaptic transmission, survival and differentiation. several hypotheses might explain this unexpected low responsiveness to the invalidation of such an evolutionary conserved protein at least in mammals. an explanation might be that the cellular response to the lack of prp does not involve transcriptomic alteration but modifications of post-transcriptomic regulations. this latter suggestion is attractive in regards with the recently published mirna specific signature observed in mouse-scrapie affected brains  <cit> . however, it is in contradiction with the lack of detectable modification of the brain proteome of prnp-/- mice  <cit> , which could rather suggest that the variations observed in the mirna profile is a consequence of the scrapie infection rather than of a prp loss of function. it is also possible that the overall brain lack of response is due to the fact that the invalidation of the prnp gene only affects a small subset of the brain cellular population and is therefore not detectable in our present transcriptomic analysis or in the proteomic experiment of crecelius et al.  <cit> . indeed, if as suggested prp positively regulates neural precursor proliferation in adult  <cit> , the effect of its invalidation might be difficult to assess without prior purification of this cell type. prp might also be essential for brain response to specific stressful physiological conditions and that the physiological role of this gene was therefore not challenged in the classical presently used breeding conditions. another attractive explanation would be that prp has a key function only during early embryogenesis, as its developmental regulation  <cit>  and recently published experimental data involving gene knockdowns  <cit>  suggest. following this early developmental stage, the physiological role of prp might be less crucial and/or redundant under normal physiological conditions. if so, it would be important to repeat transcriptomic and proteomic analyses at earlier embryonic stages, at the time prnp is turned on or under specific breeding conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper documents the lack of drastic brain transcriptomic modification following the prnp invalidation either at the zygotic stage or in adult neuronal cells of the brain tissue. it is consistent with the recently reported proteomic stability of the brain of such prp-knockout mice  <cit>  and questions some of the obtained results using in vitro cell cultures  <cit> . it might suggest that either this gene knockdown affects the animal physiology at a different developmental stage than the one studied here or that it has to be analyzed in certain particular environmental conditions and/or in more specific cell types.
