BACKGROUND
protein secretion starts with protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum  where secretory proteins mature into a functional three-dimensional conformation before they are packaged into er-to-golgi transport vesicles  <cit> . proteins that fail to fold in the er are not allowed to enter these vesicles, and are initially retained in the er  <cit> . most are subsequently exported to the cytosol and degraded by proteasomes, a process called er-associated degradation   <cit> . in yeast proteins are imported co-translationally into the er through a proteinaceous channel formed by the sec <dig> complex  <cit> . this heterotrimeric complex consists of the channel-forming sec <dig> protein, and two small proteins, sss1p and sbh1p, which stabilize the channel and mediate interactions with other protein complexes  <cit> . during posttranslational import into the yeast er the sec <dig> channel collaborates with the heterotetrameric sec <dig> complex  forming the heptameric sec complex  <cit> . in yeast transmembrane proteins follow the co-translational pathway, whereas soluble proteins are imported into the er posttranslationally, and a few primarily er-resident soluble proteins can use both pathways  <cit> . hydrophobicity of the signal sequence determines the mode of translocation, with more hydrophobic sequences leading to co-translational import  <cit> . the sec <dig> channel also plays a role in export of misfolded soluble and transmembrane proteins from the er as part of a large and likely dynamic complex consisting of an er-resident ubiquitin ligase and its accessory proteins, the sec <dig> channel, sec63p, but not the other subunits of the sec <dig> complex, and the proteasome 19s regulatory particle  <cit> .

sec61p forms the protein translocation channel which during protein import is almost certainly formed by a single sec <dig> complex  <cit> . sec61p consists of  <dig> transmembrane domains  with both termini in the cytoplasm, and two large loops, l <dig> and l <dig>  protruding from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane   <cit> . on the er lumenal side there is only one large loop, l <dig> . cytoplasmic l <dig> and l <dig> are important for binding to the ribosome during cotranslational import into the er  <cit> . the structures of the yeast and mammalian sec <dig> complexes have so far only been studied by electron microscopy  <cit> . in the crystal structures of the sec <dig> channel orthologue from archaea, the secy complex, the  <dig> transmembrane helices of secy form a funnel-shaped bundle with a hydrophobic constriction in the center of the channel  <cit> . cytosolic loops  <dig> and  <dig> can be seen clearly protruding from the extracellular face of the membrane  <cit> . on the lumenal side, no protrusions are visible, suggesting that l <dig> in the crystal was mostly unstructured and hence could not be resolved  <cit> . l <dig> almost certainly lies underneath the so-called plug  which closes the hydrophobic constriction through which signal sequences pass from the lumenal side  <cit> . thus both the plug and l <dig> have to move substantially when the sec <dig> channel opens transversally for import. since l <dig> is the only large extramembrane domain of the channel on the er-lumenal side it is also likely the point of interaction from which chaperone/misfolded protein complexes trigger channel opening for export of misfolded secretory proteins for degradation in the cytosol.

the importance of l <dig> for sec <dig> channel function is evident from numerous observations: one of the first characterized er-import defective channel mutants, sec61- <dig> , is located in the center of l <dig> and causes profound er import and erad defects concomitant with cold- and temperature-sensitivity  <cit> . in an attempt to understand how protein transport across the er membrane can work at temperatures close to freezing, our laboratory sequenced sec <dig> genes from arctic and antarctic fishes and compared them to sequences from temperate fishes  <cit> . we found that the sec <dig> sequence is extremely highly conserved between fish species, but there were a few amino acid changes primarily in l <dig> of the polar fishes that we proposed to improve channel function in the cold  <cit> . screening mice for genes that cause diabetes lloyd and colleagues discovered a sec <dig> mutant in l <dig>   <cit> . the mice had distended er cisternae in pancreatic beta cells suggesting a defect in erad leading to beta-cell death triggered by prolonged induction of the unfolded protein response   <cit> . y <dig> was one of the positions in l <dig> which we had found altered in arctic fishes  <cit> . the effects of the y344h mutation on sec <dig> channel function in mammalian cells was investigated by schäuble et al.  <cit>  who found that it caused an increased calcium leak from the er through the sec <dig> channel which - in contrast to the wildtype channel - could not be switched off by bip. the authors proposed that in the mutant the sec <dig> channel was partially open and suggested that a direct interaction of l <dig> with bip was responsible for closure of the wildtype channel  <cit> . insertions of ha-tags into l <dig> at specific positions and replacement with alanine of  <dig> amino acids which connect the mini-helix in l <dig> to tmd <dig> cause a delay in the import of soluble proteins into the er  <cit> . finally, a mutant in l <dig>  causes a defect in proteasome-binding to the cytoplasmic surface of the sec <dig> channel, suggesting that the conformation of l <dig> affects the structure of the entire molecule in the membrane  <cit>  .

because most of sec61p is embedded in the membrane, mutagenesis of the entire sec <dig> gene predominantly leads to mutations in transmembrane domains  <cit> . in order to be able to mutagenize l <dig> specifically we introduced restriction sites close to the end of transmembrane domain  <dig> and the beginning of transmembrane domain  <dig> . after l <dig> mutagenesis we screened the mutants for accumulation of the erad substrate cpy*. in these screens we repeatedly isolated sec <dig> mutants in which ligation had taken place without an insert. to our surprise, these sec61∆l <dig> mutants were viable. here we describe the characterization of the defects in sec61∆l <dig>  and compare them to those of the yeast equivalent of the diabetes-causing mutation in mouse sec <dig> 

RESULTS
yeast expressing sec61Δl <dig> are viable
in order to be able to investigate functions of l <dig> of sec61p, we generated a sec <dig> variant with aatii and bstz17i restriction sites close to the luminal ends of tmds  <dig> and  <dig> . after mutagenesis, mutant l <dig> dna was ligated into the aatii and bstz17i sites of sec61prs <dig> and transformed into kry <dig> yeast which contained wildtype sec <dig> on a ura <dig> plasmid. transformants were selected on minimal media without leucine, and the wildtype sec <dig> plasmid was counterselected on plates containing 5′- fluoroorotic acid . we identified l <dig> mutants of interest by colony-blotting for cells that accumulated the erad substrate cpy* intracellularly   <cit> . to our surprise we repeatedly isolated sec <dig> mutants in which the aatii and bstz17i ends of our construct had religated without an insert . compared to a deletion of der <dig>  an er membrane protein involved specifically in erad of soluble secretory proteins, the accumulation of cpy* in sec61∆l <dig> was more modest, but still detectable in a screen . upon sequencing we found that in the mutant amino acids 305– <dig> of sec61p had been replaced with two amino acids, arginine and glutamate, only, which is equivalent to deletion of the entire l <dig> and the luminal ends of tmds  <dig> and  <dig> . tmd <dig> is part of the lateral gate important for channel opening during secretory protein import into the er  <cit> , and deleting l <dig> should lead to a decreased flexibility of the channel, thus we expected dramatic translocation defects in sec61Δl <dig> cells. we found that nevertheless sec61Δl <dig> cells grew like wildtype cells on plates at 37°c and 30°c; the mutant cells were cold-sensitive at 20°c . the doubling time for sec61Δl <dig> was increased by 50% . we conclude that l <dig> of sec61p, although functionally important, is not essential.

interference with protein homeostasis in the er leads to activation of the upr and hypersensitivity to tunicamycin, which interferes with n-linked glycosylation in the er and hence with protein folding  <cit> . the sec <dig> complex is subject to upr regulation and translocation-defective sec <dig> mutants are frequently upr-induced and tunicamycin-sensitive  <cit> . when we incubated sec61Δl <dig> yeast on ypd-plates with  <dig>  μg/ml or  <dig>  μg/ml tunicamycin we found strong tunicamycin sensitivity at  <dig>  μg/ml . the sec61Δl <dig> strain was also sensitive to  <dig>  μg/ml tunicamycin in contrast to sec61- <dig> cells, the sec <dig> mutant with the strongest erad defect reported to date   <cit> . tunicamycin-sensitivity of yeast expressing sec61y345h which is homologous to the diabetes-causing sec61y344h in m. musculus was similar to sec61- <dig>   <cit> . we conclude that sec61Δl <dig> causes strong hypersensitivity to tunicamycin and thus er stress, indicating a profound disturbance of protein homeostasis in the er.

to investigate the effect of sec <dig> mutants on protein homeostasis in the er directly, we asked whether sec61∆l <dig> or sec61y345h elicited the upr. we transformed wildtype and mutant strains with a plasmid in which lacz was expressed under control of a upr element , or without the upre as negative control , lysed the cells, and analyzed beta-galactosidase activity. as shown in figure 2c, sec61∆l <dig> elicited a very strong upr, which was almost as strong as the upr caused by tunicamycin treatment of wildtype cells. upr induction in sec61∆l <dig> was substantially stronger than in sec61- <dig> expressing cells, although this mutation had been identified in a screen for upr-inducing sec <dig> mutants   <cit> . upr induction in sec61y345h cells was modest, but there was a significant difference between cells expressing upre-lacz and the control plasmid without the upre . we conclude that l <dig> of sec61p is important for maintenance of er protein homeostasis.

the er is a repository for ca2+ which is an essential co-factor for chaperones in the er lumen  <cit> . in mammalian cells the sec <dig> channel is responsible for a ca2+-leak from the er, and sec61y344h leads to defects in er ca2+-homeostasis  <cit> . therefore we investigated whether in yeast sec61Δl <dig> or sec61y345h were defective in ca2+-sealing of the er by analysing their growth in the presence of the ca2+-chelator egta. we detected no effect on growth of either mutant on egta, while growth of a strain deleted for the ca2+-pump pmr1p  was inhibited by 5 mm egta . we conclude that in yeast neither sec61y345h nor sec61Δl <dig> cause gross defects in ca2+-sealing of the er.

deletion of l <dig> affects soluble protein import into the er
l <dig> is important for sec <dig> channel function in protein transport across the er membrane . we therefore asked whether we were able to detect secretory precursors in lysates of sec61Δl <dig> cells. soluble prepro alpha factor  is posttranslationally transported across the er-membrane and highly sensitive for defects in translocation. we analysed the accumulation of ppαf in sec61Δl <dig> cells after incubation at 37°c, 30°c and 20°c for 3 h compared to sec <dig>  and sec61- <dig> yeast which are cold-sensitive and defective in protein import into the er  <cit> . cytosolic accumulation of ppαf was increased in sec61Δl <dig> cells compared to wildtype at all temperatures, and similar to the accumulation in sec61- <dig> mutants . in contrast, cotranslational er membrane integration of dpapb was barely affected in sec61∆l <dig> cells . we next asked whether expression levels of the sec61p homolog ssh1p were altered in sec61∆l <dig> cells. ssh1p forms a heterotrimeric complex with sbh2p and sss1p which mediates exclusively cotranslational import into the er  <cit> , and elevation of ssh1p expression may therefore be able to compensate a cotranslational import defect in sec61∆l <dig> cells. we used polyclonal antibodies specific for ssh1p and determined the ratio of ssh1p to sss1p in wildtype and sec61∆l <dig> microsomes. we found that in sec61∆l <dig> cells, expression of ssh1p was increased approximately  <dig>  fold . given that wildtype yeast cells contain 10x less ssh <dig> complexes than sec <dig> complexes  <cit>  it seems unlikely that this modest elevation in the number of ssh <dig> complexes in sec61∆l <dig> cells was able to compensate a significant cotranslational import defect in sec61∆l <dig> translocons. we conclude that deletion of l <dig> causes a strong defect in posttranslational import of soluble proteins into the er.

deletion of l <dig> interferes with soluble misfolded protein export from the er
the sec <dig> channel is a strong candidate for the misfolded protein export channel for erad and mutations in sec <dig> result in a delayed export of erad substrates to the proteasome in the cytosol  <cit> . therefore we investigated possible erad defects in sec61∆l <dig> cells by performing cycloheximide chase and pulse-chase experiments using soluble cpy* as a substrate. cpy* is a substrate for erad because of misfolding due to the g255r mutation close to its active site  <cit> . in a cycloheximide chase monitoring steady state levels of proteins, we found strong accumulation of cytosolic pcpy* in sec61Δl <dig> cells, and only a small amount of cpy* present in the er-lumen . cpy* degradation was barely detectable in sec61∆l <dig> cells resulting in an accumulation of cpy* in the er-lumen .

to monitor the fate of newly synthesized cpy* only, proteins were radioactively labelled with -met/cys for 5 min, and samples taken every 20 min for up to 1 h. in sec61Δl <dig> cells, posttranslational translocation of newly synthesized pcpy* was dramatically reduced compared to wildtype . the small amount of translocated cpy* accumulated within the er initially, but after approximately 30 min, limited erad was detectable with slow kinetics compared to wildtype . in wildtype cells cpy* was efficiently imported into the er and degraded with a t½ of less than 20 min . although it is difficult to differentiate the relative contributions of slow posttranslational import and slow misfolded protein export, the erad defect we show here in sec61Δl <dig> cells is the strongest observed for cpy* in any sec <dig> mutant characterized so far.

the diabetes-causing y345h mutation in l <dig> delays initiation of erad
the mammalian equivalent of the y345h mutation in sec61p causes diabetes in the mouse, and dilated er cisternae in the pancreatic beta cells indicate accumulation of proteins in the er  <cit> . we used a cycloheximide chase experiment to determine the effect of the y345h substitution in yeast sec61p on cpy* degradation. in three independent cycloheximide chase experiments, we observed a delay in the initiation of degradation of about 20 min . after 20 min, degradation proceeded with kinetics comparable to the sec <dig> wildtype strain . sec61p in sec61y345h cells was stable . sec62p served as a loading control and is stable for several hours in cycloheximide chase assays  <cit> . our data suggest that similar to the delay in soluble protein import in the l <dig> mutants generated by trueman et al.  <cit>  the sec61y345h mutation causes a delay in the initiation of erad.

deletion of l <dig> effects on transmembrane protein erad
since we had detected a profound defect in soluble protein transport across the er membrane in both directions in cells lacking l <dig> of sec61p, but none in cotranslational import of transmembrane proteins , we decided to also investigate the fate of two transmembrane erad substrates in the sec61∆l <dig> strain. we first used pulse-chase experiments to determine the half life of the single spanning transmembrane erad substrate kww, and for comparison that of its soluble counterpart khn  <cit> . khn consists of the yeast kar2p signal peptide fused to the simian virus  <dig> ha-neuraminidase ectodomain, and is imported into the er using both the co- and the posttranslational pathway  <cit> . as expected, it therefore was imported more efficiently into the er of sec61∆l <dig> cells than preprocpy* . nevertheless we observed a dramatic increase in half life for soluble khn , confirming the erad defect for soluble substrates in sec61∆l <dig> yeast. in the transmembrane erad substrate kww the simian virus  <dig> ha-neuraminidase ectodomain is fused to the single membrane-spanning domain of the type i membrane protein wsc1p  <cit> . in wildtype cells kww was degraded with a t1/ <dig> of about 30 min  comparable to its reported t1/ <dig> of 35 min  <cit> . while the t1/ <dig> of kww was slightly increased in sec61∆l <dig> cells to approximately 50 min , the effect of the absence of l <dig> was modest compared to that on erad of soluble substrates.

we next investigated the fate of deg1:sec62p, an erad substrate with two transmembrane domains and both termini in the cytoplasm, using cycloheximide chase experiments  <cit> . the cytosolic n-terminus of deg1:sec62p contains an n-glycosylation acceptor site which during erad is translocated into the er lumen and modified  <cit> . unfortunately, the protein was poorly expressed in our strain background so the determination of its exact half life was problematic, and although we repeated the experiment several times, expression could not be improved. what can be seen on the blot, however, is that the glycosylated form of deg1:sec62p, for which erad had been already initiated by translocation of the n-terminus into the er lumen, was degraded with similar kinetics in sec <dig> wildtype and sec61∆l <dig> cells . while in wildtype cells this glycosylated form was dominant , in sec61∆l <dig> cells the unglycosylated lower band was more prominent . this lower band was largely stable in sec61∆l <dig> cells , demonstrating again that l <dig> is essential for initiation of erad processes that require translocation of a soluble domain across the er membrane. in contrast entry of tmds into the lateral gate of the sec <dig> channel during erad appears to be only moderately dependent on the presence of l <dig> 

stability of sec61∆l7p
deletion of  <dig> amino acids resulted in sec61Δl7p migrating faster in sds-gels than wildtype sec61p . the amount of sec61Δl7p detected by immunoblotting with an n-terminal antibody was only ~70% compared to wildtype and sec61- <dig> cells . the expression levels we observed are similar to those of other sec <dig> mutants expressed from plasmids without causing translocation effects  <cit> . increasing the expression of sss1p can suppress the functional defect in sec61p in sec61- <dig> mutants  <cit> . therefore we asked whether sec61Δl <dig> cells had elevated their sss1p levels to maintain viability. we examined the expression levels of sss1p, sbh1p and sec62p, but did not detect any differences between wildtype and sec61∆l <dig> mutant cells . the reduced amount of sec61Δl7p in the mutant cells  may have been due to instability of sec61p in the absence of l <dig>  we therefore also examined the stability of sec61Δl7p in our cycloheximide chase analyses . over 1 h, however, sec61Δl7p was as stable as the wildtype protein and the sec62p loading control .

the trimeric sec <dig> complex is unstable in the absence of l7
we next asked whether instability of any of the protein complexes formed with sec61p was the explanation for the protein translocation defects observed in sec61∆l <dig> cells. the trimeric sec <dig> complex, which consists of sec61p, sss1p and sbh1p, is stable in triton-x <dig>  in contrast to the heptameric sec complex  <cit> . we solubilized microsomes derived from wildtype and sec61∆l <dig> cells in triton-x <dig> and analysed sec <dig> complex integrity by sedimentation in a 0-15% sucrose gradient. after centrifugation, fractions were taken from the top, proteins separated by sds-page, and sss1p, sbh1p and sec61p detected by immunoblotting. the stable trimeric sec <dig> complex was located in fractions 5– <dig> where sec61p, sss1p and sbh1p were detectable in microsomal lysates from sec <dig> wildtype yeast . in lysates from sec61Δl <dig> membranes, substantial fractions of sbh1p and sss1p were found in fractions 1– <dig> which represent the monomeric states of sss1p and sbh1p . this suggests that sec61Δl7p fails to bind sbh1p and sss1p appropriately, and that this leads to an instability of the trimeric sec <dig> complex. the effect was most striking for sss1p, which in the sec61∆l <dig> mutant was found almost exclusively in the monomeric fraction . the distribution of sec61Δl7p in the gradient also changed compared to wildtype sec61p: it was found concentrated in fractions  <dig> and  <dig> where no sss1p and little sbh1p was present . surprisingly, in contrast to the small subunits, no sec61∆l7p was found in the monomeric fractions on the top of the gradient .

to confirm the altered interaction of sec61∆l7p with the small subunits of the sec <dig> complex we performed a chemical crosslinking experiment. in mammalian microsomes, chemical crosslinking with sulfhydryl-reactive bifunctional bis-maleimidohexane  results in a prominent band consisting of the sec61p homologue sec61α and the sbh1p homologue sec61β  <cit> . this crosslink is sensitive to structural changes in the translocon and disappears upon treatment of the membranes with edta, and after stripping off ribosomes with puromycin and high salt  <cit> . we treated wildtype or sec61∆l <dig> mutant yeast microsomes with the amine-reactive homobifunctional crosslinker disuccinimidyl suberate  which has approximately the same linker length as bmh but more potential target amino acids in sec61p, sss1p and sbh1p. crosslinking of wildtype membranes resulted in a single prominent crosslinked band which was about  <dig> kd larger than sec61p . immunoblotting on the crosslinked material with antibodies against sbh1p and sss1p revealed that this band contained primarily sec61p/sss1p heterodimers , but a very modest amount of sec61p/sbh1p heterodimers was also detected . in sec61∆l <dig> microsomes, the crosslink was at least 5-fold weaker compared to wildtype membranes confirming changes in the interactions of sec61∆l7p with sss1p . we conclude that l <dig> of sec61p is essential for hetero-oligomeric stability of the sec <dig> complex, and thus for stability of the sec <dig> channel.

loss of l <dig> does not affect sec <dig> complex interaction with the sec <dig> complex
the heptameric sec complex consists of the trimeric sec <dig> complex associated with the sec <dig> complex comprising sec62p, sec63p, sec71p and sec72p. sec71p is the only glycosylated sec complex subunit; association of the sec <dig> complex with the sec <dig> complex can therefore be demonstrated by co-precipitation of sec61p with the lectin concanavalina  <cit> . the heptameric sec complex is stable in digitonin. to ask whether l <dig> deletion in sec61p had any effect on formation of the sec complex, we solubilized wildtype and sec61∆l <dig> microsomes in digitonin and removed ribosome-bound sec <dig> complexes by ultracentrifugation . from the lysate, we precipitated the heptameric sec complex using concanavalina-sepharose and analysed both the amount of free sec <dig> complex in the supernatant and the amount of concanavalina-associated sec <dig> complex by western blotting . saturation of the precipitation was controlled by a second concanavalina precipitation from the supernatant . in lysates from sec <dig> wildtype membranes, the amount of sec61p in the free-fraction was 25-30%, and the remainder was found with the heptameric sec complex in the concanavalina-bound fraction . the amount of digitonin-solubilized sec61Δl7p was substantially lower than that of the wildtype protein, and its distribution was also different: almost all detectable sec61Δl7p was found in the concanavalina-bound fraction, and little if any in the free fraction . inspection of the upper part of the gel showed that sec61∆l7p forms sds-resistant aggregates in digitonin, in contrast to wildtype sec61p . the ratios of wildtype or mutant sec61p to sec62p, however, were similar in the concanavalina-bound fractions  suggesting no dramatic effects of the l <dig> deletion on heptameric sec complex formation.

loss of l <dig> does not interfere with binding of proteasomes to the sec <dig> complex
numerous mutations in sec <dig> affect export of misfolded proteins from the er to the cytosol for degradation by proteasomes . in addition, proteasomes can bind directly to the sec <dig> channel, and a specific mutation in l <dig> affects proteasome binding  <cit>  . we therefore asked whether the y345h mutation or deletion of l <dig> had any effects on the interaction of the sec <dig> channel with proteasomes. we had observed previously that solubilization of yeast membranes and reconstitution of total protein into proteoliposomes improved proteasome binding to the membranes  <cit> . we therefore prepared proteoliposomes from wildtype, sec61y345h and sec61∆l <dig> puromycin/high salt-treated microsomes and performed binding experiments with purified yeast 19s proteasome particles as described  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  we found no differences in proteasome binding between wildtype  and sec61y345h  proteoliposomes. binding of 19s particles to sec61∆l <dig> proteoliposomes consistently was slightly higher than to wildtype sec <dig> proteoliposomes . we conclude that the erad defects observed in sec61y345h and sec61∆l <dig> yeast are not due to defects in proteasome interaction with the sec <dig> channels in the er membrane.

discussion
in this paper we have characterized a new sec <dig> mutant, sec61∆l <dig>  which lacks the functionally important er-lumenal loop  <dig> and the adjacent ends of tmds  <dig> and  <dig> . the deletion shortens tmd <dig> of sec61p to  <dig> amino acids which on its own is too short to span a bilayer  <cit> . in the context of a polytopic membrane protein, however, the hydrophobic mismatch of an individual short tmd during membrane integration can be compensated by the surrounding tmds which stabilize the short segment in the membrane  <cit> . our data suggest that the topology of sec61∆l7p was unaltered as cells expressing sec61∆l <dig> as sole copy of sec <dig> were alive and growing . sec61∆l7p was expressed only to about 70% of wildtype protein levels , and while the protein was stable in a cycloheximide chase  our data cannot exclude a slight defect early in sec61∆l7p biogenesis. in cells expressing sec <dig> from a gal promoter, however, protein levels need to be reduced well below 50% before translocation defects occur, and heterozygous diploids with only one functional copy of sec <dig> do not have er translocation defects . it therefore seems unlikely that the expression level of the mutant protein per se was the cause for the translocation defects observed.

the sec61∆l <dig> mutant was more sensitive to cold and tunicamycin than sec61- <dig> cells, and displayed a stronger upr induction suggesting a more severe disturbance of er translocation and er protein homeostasis than in the sec <dig> allele with the strongest erad defect identified previously   <cit> . mutant sec61∆l <dig> cells strongly accumulated soluble posttranslationally translocated preproalpha factor in the cytosol , and displayed a profound import defect for soluble posttranslationally translocated pcpy* in both cycloheximide chase and pulse-chase experiments . association of the sec61∆l <dig> complex with the sec <dig> complex was normal , however, so the defect in posttranslational import must be due to a functional defect in the heptameric complex.

although the solubilized sec61∆l <dig> complex was unstable , cotranslational membrane integration of dpapb was barely affected . modelling of the sec61∆l <dig> mutant protein suggests that structural changes are limited largely to the er-lumenal face of the sec <dig> channel, and that the cytoplasmic surface of the channel remains similar to wildtype . combined with our experimental data this indicates that ribosome binding to sec61∆l <dig> channels can proceed normally and ribosome binding likely stabilizes trimeric sec61∆l <dig> channels such that subsequent channel opening can proceed in the absence of the lumenal end of the lateral gate and l <dig> 

ribosomes and proteasomes bind to different regions of the cytoplasmic face of the sec <dig> channel, but the largely unaltered cytoplasmic surface of the sec61∆l <dig> channel likely also explains why proteasome binding was not reduced  <cit>  . we were suprised by this observation because we had found previously that a point mutation in l <dig>  s353c, reduces proteasome affinity for the sec <dig> channel  <cit>  . it therefore appears that when it is present the conformation of l <dig> is important for proteasome interaction with the channel, and that conformation of l <dig> can be transmitted through the transmembrane helices to the cytoplasmic face of the channel. our data regarding proteasome binding to sec61∆l <dig> channels suggest that the defect in soluble misfolded protein export in sec61∆l <dig> cells shown in figure  <dig> is not due to reduced proteasome binding.

the relative contributions of slow import and slow export to the profound erad defect in sec61∆l <dig> cells are difficult to differentiate for posttranslationally imported substrates . we observed progressive accumulation of soluble cpy* in the er over time  which suggests that export may be even slower than import, possibly because there is a direct competition of the two processes for common factors   <cit> . this phenotype is similar to the result of overexpression of cpy* where increasing the load on the er-to-cytosol transport pathway causes cytosolic accumulation of secretory precursors which could be alleviated by increasing the expression of sec <dig>  <cit> . co-translational membrane protein integration was barely affected in sec61∆l <dig> . the strong defects in soluble protein import and export through the sec61∆l <dig> channel indicate that in the absence of l <dig> the channel can no longer open properly in the transverse direction. while integration of membrane proteins via lateral channel opening towards the lipid bilayer is still possible, and re-entry of simple transmembrane erad substrates is only moderately delayed, transport of soluble proteins through the channel in either direction is strongly impeded, and the general slowdown in transport might lead to competition of biosynthetic soluble protein import and misfolded soluble protein export for erad.

import of khn mediated by the bip signal peptide which can use both posttranslational and cotranslational import pathways was barely affected in sec61∆l <dig> cells . this suggests that bip likewise will be translocated efficiently into the er in sec61∆l <dig> cells, and when we blotted on wildtype and mutant extracts we did not detect cytosolic bip precursor in sec61∆l <dig> cells . erad of khn, however, was strongly defective in the sec61∆l <dig> mutant  in contrast to erad of its membrane-anchored counterpart kww whose half life increased only moderately . since khn and kww have been shown by vashist and ng  <cit>  to have identical chaperone requirements for erad, this experiment demonstrates that - rather than affecting indirectly the chaperone composition in the er lumen - sec61∆l <dig> has a direct negative effect on export from the er of soluble substrates only.

the sec61y345h mutant had no growth defect at any temperature , and a tunicamycin sensitivity comparable to sec61- <dig>  and sec61- <dig>  <cit> . it was fully functional in protein import into the er , and had only a modest defect in erad of cpy*   <cit> . that sec61y345h causes an erad defect in the absence of a secretory protein biogenesis defect confirms the direct role of sec61p in erad. strikingly, sec61y345h caused a delay in initiation of erad rather than absolute slower kinetics of export for degradation   <cit>  suggesting that this position in l <dig> might play a role in the initiation of sec <dig> channel opening from the lumenal side for export of erad substrates. one would expect a mild phenotype in order for mice to survive this mutation in an essential gene  <cit> . delayed er export in pancreatic beta cells which have a high secretory protein load would result in gradual er accumulation of misfolded proteins, followed by cell death, and the development of diabetes as a primary phenotype  <cit> . the delay in the initiation of erad in sec61y345h yeast is reminiscent of the delay in protein import observed by trueman et al.  <cit>  in l <dig> mutants that disrupt the interaction of l <dig> with tmd <dig>  taken together, our data suggest that l <dig> conformation is crucial for sec <dig> channel gating for both import and erad of soluble proteins.

modelling of the sec61∆l <dig> protein suggests that the ‘plug’ formed by transmembrane helix 2a remains in place, but the lateral gate formed by interaction of transmembrane helix 2b with transmembrane helix  <dig> is partially open, as helix 2b is shifted significantly towards the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane . this shift is likely the consequence of the missing lumenal end of tmd <dig> which can no longer interact with helix 2b and hold it in place. the deletion in sec61∆l7p begins  <dig> amino acids c-terminal of n <dig> which is the most c-terminal residue of the gating motif responsible for setting the hydrophobicity threshold for entry of signal sequences into the sec <dig> channel  <cit> . destabilizing the gating motif by replacing n <dig> with more polar amino acids causes promiscuous insertion of even marginally hydrophobic signal peptides into the gate  <cit> . in sec∆l7p n <dig> is under strain because it is now close to the end of truncated tmd <dig> which is connected to tmd <dig> by only  <dig> amino acids . this will weaken the hydrogen bonds to n <dig> partners in the gating motif which likely explains the partial opening of the gate . while the destabilization of the lateral gate in the sec61∆l <dig> channel is similar to that of the n302-to-polar mutants, in contrast to trueman et al.  <cit>  we do not see enhanced import of soluble proteins by the sec61∆l <dig> channel, but rather an almost complete block of transport of soluble proteins into and out of the er . both we and trueman et al.  <cit>  observed much milder effects or none on the integration of transmembrane proteins into the er in our respective mutants   <cit> . trueman et al. did not investigate the effects of their l <dig> and gating motif mutants on erad  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown here that a sec61p mutant lacking er-lumenal loop  <dig> displays severe erad defects for soluble substrates . in contrast, erad of single-spanning kww was only moderately slower than in wildtype yeast . for soluble misfolded protein export to the cytosol through the sec <dig> channel l <dig> is the only possible starting point, because it is the only large extramembrane domain of the channel in the er lumen. if l <dig> is missing, chaperone/export substrate complexes have no contact point from which to open the lateral gate, and exit from the er is compromised; transmembrane proteins, however, can still enter laterally into the gate using their hydrophobic tmds. collectively, our data suggest that lateral gate opening of the sec <dig> channel for entry or exit can proceed independently of l <dig>  whereas transverse gating for soluble protein transport in either direction requires the presence of l <dig>
