BACKGROUND
the wide use of chromium  in textile, leather tanning and electroplating industries with subsequent sewage disposal causes severe contamination of global soil-water systems  <cit> . highly soluble, hexavalent chromium  is very toxic. as an analogue of sulfate, chromate can enter bacterial and mammalian cells readily via sulfate transport systems  <cit> . the subsequent reduction of cr by glutathione, thiols and other metabolites, and coproduction of reactive oxygen species  that damage dna and other cellular components are the cause of the carcinogenic, mutational, and teratogenic potential of chromate  <cit> . on the other hand, the trivalent chromium  is less bioavailable, thermodynamically stable and less toxic  <cit> . accordingly, the reduction of toxic cr to stable cr is an efficient way to remove chromate from soil and water systems.

bioremediation of chromate-contaminated sites, especially when stimulating indigenous microbial communities, is getting more and more attention because of its economical and environmental friendly aspects compared to chemical and physical methods  <cit> . an increasing number of cr- reducing bacteria have been detected and studied including a pseudomonad strain crb <dig>  <cit> , brucella sp.  <cit> , bacillus sp. strain qc1- <dig>  <cit> , burkholderia cepacia mcmb- <dig>  <cit>  and thermus scotoductus strain sa- <dig>  <cit> .

bacteria have developed different strategies of chromate resistance including chromate efflux and chromate reduction. efflux of chromate, which is mediated by the chromate transporter protein chra, has been confirmed in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl <dig>  <cit>  and shewanella sp. ana- <dig>  <cit> . prior studies have not identified a chromate-responsive regulatory protein. most chromate reduction studies have focused on soluble enzymes encoded by genes located on chromosomes  <cit> . however, very few of the proteins responsible for chromate reduction have been purified and characterized because of technical difficulties. when examining induction of chromate resistance and reduction genes, several strains including shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> , ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl <dig>  <cit>  and ralstonia metallidurans strain ch <dig>  <cit>  have been shown to contain genes induced by chromate.

in this study, a chromate-resistant and reducing strain bacillus cereus sj <dig> was successfully isolated from chromium contaminated wastewater of a metal electroplating factory. three chromate transporter related genes chra, a chromate responsive regulator chri, four nitr genes encoding nitroreductase and one azoreductase gene azor possibly involved in chromate reduction were identified by the draft genome sequence. using rt-pcr technology, we found that all of the five genes encoding putative chromate reductases appeared to be expressed constitutively. in contrast, the gene chra <dig> encoding a transporter with high homology to other transporters linked to chromate resistance was up-regulated by the addition of cr together with the adjacent putative transcriptional regulator chri. since chra <dig> is probably regulated by chri, this suggests identification of the first known chromate-responsive regulator.

RESULTS
identification of cr-reducing b. cereus sj <dig> that is highly chromate resistant
strain sj <dig> showing both high cr resistance and reduction abilities was isolated from industrial wastewater of a metal plating factory. sj <dig> was a gram positive, rod shaped bacterium. the  <dig> s rdna sequence was used for bacterial identification. sj <dig> showed the highest identity  with b. cereus 03bb <dig>  and was hereafter referred to as b. cereus sj <dig> 

b. cereus sj <dig> showed rapid reduction of cr aerobically. cell growth and cr reduction by b. cereus sj <dig> were monitored spectrophotometrically . the growth rate of sj <dig> was rapid. it reached log-phase in 4- <dig> h in lb medium and the growth rate was decreased by addition of  <dig> mm chromate. in the first  <dig> h, the chromate reduction rate was shown to be fastest under optimum ph  and temperature  conditions . after  <dig> h of incubation, up to 97% soluble cr was reduced and white precipitate was visible at the bottom of the flasks  <cit> . abiotic cr reduction was not observed in cell-free lb medium . after cultivation of b. cereus sj <dig> for  <dig> h with  <dig> mm k2cro <dig>  the cell became shorter with roughness on the cell surfaces possibable caused by the environmental stress of chromate 

general features of b. cereus sj <dig> draft genome and genes involved in chromate metabolism
draft genome sequence analysis of b. cereus sj <dig> showed a genome size of about  <dig>  mb distributed in  <dig> contigs with an average gc content of  <dig> %, containing  <dig>  putative coding sequences . there are  <dig> trna genes representing all  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> scattered ribosomal rna genes identified on the draft genome. the likely origin of replication of the chromosome of b. cereus sj <dig> was located in a  <dig>  kb region that included co-localization of six genes . it was localized by comparing its draft genome to complete genomes of several strains of the b. cereus group though mummer <dig> .

three putative chromate transporter genes, chra <dig>  chra <dig> and chra <dig> were identified in the genome of b. cereus sj <dig> . the chra <dig> encoding chra protein showed the highest amino acid identity  with a homologous protein annotated as chromate transporter in bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian str. 97- <dig> . interestingly, chra <dig> gene  located downstream of a potential transcriptional regulator gene chri . the region of chra <dig> and chri also contained several cdss encoding homologs of tn7-like transposition proteins and a resolvase that could potentially have been involved in horizontal gene transfer events . this region covered  <dig> kb sequence and showed lower gc content  compared with the average gc content of b. cereus sj1's whole genome . a similar region was also observed in b. thuringiensis serovar konkukian str. 97- <dig> , but was absent in other b. cereus genomes. remarkably, differing from b. thuringiensis serovar konkukian str. 97- <dig>  this region of b. cereus sj <dig> contained several genes related to arsenic resistance including genes encoding an arsenic resistance operon repressor arsr, arsenic resistance protein arsb, arsenate reductase arsc, arsenic chaperon arsd and arsenic pump atpase arsa . this may indicate a very recent horizontal gene transfer  event since genes located upstream of chria <dig> and downstream of arsenic resistance genes were resolvase and tn7-like transposition protein abbcccd in both strains. furthermore, four nitr genes encoding nitroreductases and a gene azor, encoding an azoreductase that had previously been reported to catalyze chromate reduction  <cit>  were found in the draft genome .

heavy metal tolerance of b. cereus sj <dig> and putative genes responsible for heavy metal resistance
since b. cereus sj <dig> was isolated from industrial wastewater containing various toxic elements in addition to chromium, the mics of b. cereus sj <dig> for these heavy metals were determined. for b. cereus sj <dig>  the highest resistance was found for as, while hg was the most toxic compared to the other metal ions. when b. cereus sj <dig> was incubated with increasing as concentration, no viable cells were recovered at concentrations above  <dig> mm as and  <dig> mm as. the mics of b. cereus sj <dig> for cu, co, ni, cd, ag and hg were  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively. in order to survive in such unfavorable habitat, b. cereus sj <dig> must have various determinants to tolerate such harsh conditions. for example, the copper concentration of the wastewater was as high as  <dig>  mm and the mic of b. cereus sj <dig> to copper was  <dig>  mm in r2a medium. when we analyzed the genome sequence of b. cereus sj <dig>  several genes related to copper resistance including copper-exporting p-type atpase copa, copper export protein copc, copper resistance protein copd, copper homeostasis protein cutc and two multicopper oxidases were identified. furthermore, many other putative heavy metal resistance genes including those for as, zn, mn, co, cd, te and hg were also identified in the b. cereus sj <dig> draft genome .

chromate reduction is constitutive
the difference in chromate reducing ability of b. cereus sj <dig> with and without cr induction was not significant . although less rapid chromate reduction was observed in b. cereus sj <dig> cells induced before inoculation during the first  <dig> h, both cultures emerged at approximately 85% chromate reduced within  <dig> h. no abiotic cr reduction was observed in lb medium without bacterial inoculation. induction of genes possibly responsible for chromate reduction was also evaluated by rt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  all the four nitr genes and the azor gene were expressed constitutively. the results of rt-pcr were in agreement with the bacterial chromate induction experiment , strongly indicating no significant regulatory influence of chromate on chromate reduction.

expression of chra <dig> is inducible by chromate
using the procedure described in methods, we found that the uninduced and induced cells grew to similar cell densities in medium containing  <dig> mm cr as determined spectrophotometrically at od <dig>  however, the induced cells grew to higher cell densities than the uninduced cells at higher cr concentrations in the growth medium. the mic of induced b. cereus sj <dig> to k2cro <dig> was  <dig> mm whereas that of the uninduced strain was  <dig> mm .

induction of the different chra genes was also evaluated by rt-pcr using rna isolated from cultures grown in the presence and absence of  <dig>  mm cr from  <dig> h to  <dig> h . a chra1-specific fragment was clearly visible when cr was added that was absent when no cr was added , indicating expression of chra <dig> was induced by the addition of cr. in contrast, rt-pcr of the other two chra genes, chra <dig> and chra <dig>  showed that both were expressed constitutively. no products were found using total rna as the template for pcr amplification, thus indicating the absence of dna contamination in the total rna preparations.

chri, encoding a transcriptional regulator, is regulated by chromate
the chri gene located upstream of chra <dig> encodes a protein with 98% amino acid sequence identity to the padr-family transcriptional regulator from b. thuringiensis serovar konkukian str. 97- <dig> . as chri was a potential transcriptional regurator, it should be responsive to the inducer , so we analyzed the transcription of chri at  <dig> and  <dig> min after addition of k2cro <dig>  a very weak pcr product was detected with cdna from uninduced cells as shown in figure 6b. the level of the chri gene transcript was 16-fold higher  in cells induced for  <dig> min compared to the uninduced culture , confirming substrate-mediated regulation of chri. to confirm the hypothesis that chri-chra <dig> was transcribed as a single transcription unit, rt-pcr was carried out with mrna prepared from b. cereus sj <dig> grown with and without k2cro <dig>  as described above. pcr products of the expected size  were obtained with cdna from both induced and uninduced cultures as the templates , which indicated chri and chra <dig> were arranged as an operon. no pcr products were amplified using total rna as the template that was designed to detect dna contamination.

the arrangement of chri genes in an operon together with chra encoding a chromate transporter can be detected in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria . an alignment of chri homologs was constructed using chri of b. cereus sj <dig> and other related proteins encoded in operons having a chri gene adjacent to a chra gene . the more-conserved domains were located in the n- and c-terminal regions. within the conserved domains, two amino acids, lysine and arginine, were identified that might be involved in chromate binding and recognition.

discussion
chromate-reducing bacteria have been discovered in both contaminated and non-polluted environments  <cit> . in this study, a chromate-resistant strain b. cereus sj <dig> was isolated from chromium contaminated wastewater of a metal plating factory in china. b. cereus sj <dig> showed a rapid growth rate in chromate containing medium and efficient chromate-reducing ability under aerobic conditions. since the isolation site for b. cereus sj <dig> was contaminated with as much as  <dig>  mg cr per liter , we reasoned that genes conferring chromate resistance could be present in this strain. by genome sequencing analysis, we were able to identify a putative chromate transport operon chria <dig> and two additional chra genes encoding putative chromate transporters that confer chromate resistance. furthermore, we also found an azoreductase gene azor and four nitr genes that encode nitroreductases which may catalyze reduction of chromate  <cit> .

the membrane transporter protein chra has been shown to be responsible for extrusion of chromate ions across the cytoplasmic membrane in p. aeruginosa  <cit> , ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl <dig>  <cit>  and shewanella sp. ana <dig>  <cit> . it was demonstrated that the chromate transporter chra functions as a chemiosmotic pump that extrudes chromate using proton-motive force  <cit> . chra protein belongs to the chr superfamily which includes dozens of putative homologs from all three domains of life  <cit> . cr induction of b. cereus sj <dig> in this study conferred the ability to survive at a higher chromate concentration. exposure to chromate resulted in the up-regulation of chra <dig> and higher chromate resistance. possibly increased level of chra <dig> is responsible for higher chromate resistance.

the chri gene product located upstream of chra <dig> showed a high homology to padr-family transcriptional regulators. the pada gene encoding phenolic acid decarboxylase, is a member of the padr family that has been identified as a transcriptional repressor in pediococcus pentosaceus  <cit>  and lactobacillus plantarum  <cit> . although genes encoding padr homologs located either upstream or downstream of putative chromate transporter gene chra have been identified in many genera, such as b. thuringiensis serovar konkukian str. 97- <dig> , oceanobacillus iheyensis hte <dig> , b. licheniformis atcc  <dig> , the real function of a padr homolog associated with chromate resistance has never been reported. in this study, this gene encoding a padr homolog was renamed as chri since it was induced by chromate. by an alignment of most padr-like regulators which form an operon with the chromate transporter gene chra, highly conserved basic amino acids  were identified in chri and the homologs that might be involved in chromate binding and recognition because they would carry a positive charge under physiological conditions. possibly the negatively charged oxyanion cro42- would preferentially bind the basic, positively charged amino acids conserved in the putative transcriptional regulator chri.

a strong selective pressure for transformation of metal- and metalloid-related resistance genes is present in heavy metal contaminated environments  <cit> . horizontal gene transfer  events driven by mobile genetic elements, such as phages, plasmids, insertion sequences, integrons and transposons, have been shown to provide microbes with a wide variety of adaptive traits for microbial survival under hostile environmental conditions. in this study, b. cereus sj <dig> was isolated from wastewater contaminated with multiple heavy metals. the presence of a resolvase gene upstream of chria <dig> and an arsenic resistance gene cluster, and the tn7-like transposition proteins abbcccd gene downstream of the arsenic resistance operon in b. cereus sj <dig> but absent in other strains of b. cereus implied the possibility of a recent hgt event. interestingly, other strains of b. cereus harbor a gene encoding chrd-domain-containing protein adjacent to the chra gene. whether these proteins have a regulatory role is currently unknown  <cit> . in addition, chra <dig> from b. cereus sj <dig> is only distantly related to chra proteins from other strains of b. cereus indicating potential horizontal gene transfer from other gram-positive bacteria as an adaptation to survive in a highly chromate contaminated environment.

chromate can be reduced nonenzymatically as well as by various bacterial enzymes. dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from thermus scotoductus sa- <dig>  <cit> , azoreductase in shewanella oneidensis  <cit>  and flavoproteins from p. putida and e. coli  <cit>  were previously reported to be associated with cr reduction. compared to the one electron transfer chromate reductase gene chrr from p. putida, yief from e. coli was proposed to be a more appropriate gene for bioremediation applications because of the three-electron transfer ability of its gene product and consequently, the generation of fewer reactive oxygen species   <cit> . in our study, one azoreductase gene azor and four nitr genes encoding nitroreductase obtained from b. cereus sj <dig> showed high identities with other cr reductases and were expressed constitutively. since cr reduction of strain sj <dig> was not inducible by chromate, other potential chromate reductases in b. cereus sj <dig> must also be constitutively expressed and the enzyme activity is probably adventitious.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes insights into the chromate resistance and reduction capabilities of b. cereus sj <dig> using both physiological and molecular techniques. the expression of the chromate transporter gene chra <dig> was inducible by cr and most likely regulated by chri. even though the physiological function of chri has not been verified due to the absence of a genetic system for this gram positive strain, chri is most likely the first identified chromate responsive regulator. in addition, genome analysis identified a number of putative genes encoding gene products with possible functions in chromate resistance and reduction which may be the basis for the observed high chromate resistance and reduction ability of this strain. furthermore, possible horizontal gene transfer events indicated in this study may have enabled b. cereus sj <dig> to survive in metal  contaminated environments.
