BACKGROUND
neurogenesis commences in the developing telencephalon when symmetrically dividing neural stem cells in the neuroepithelium begin to divide asymmetrically  <cit> . neuronal progenitors proliferate and migrate to form the stratified layers of the cortex, with the earliest neurons forming the preplate or primordial plexiform layer  <cit> . a number of genes that are required for the proper formation of the cortex have already been identified including the transcription factors pax <dig> and foxg <dig>  <cit> . larger scale genomic approaches have also been used to identify genes important for cortical development, and these studies have added to the catalog of genes that may be required during cortical neurogenesis  <cit> .

other participants in gene regulatory networks include micrornas , which are short non-coding rna molecules that bind to target mrnas and cause either rna degradation or translation inhibition . mirnas were originally identified in the regulation of a developmental transition in c. elegans  <cit> . mirnas are expressed in all tissues, but the brain appears to have the highest diversity of mirna expression  <cit> . a number of brain-enriched mirnas have been identified including mir- <dig> and mir-124a  <cit> . these two mirnas have been shown to play a role in promoting the transition from neuronal progenitors into differentiated neurons  <cit> . several reports have identified inverse expression patterns between a mirna and predicted targets, including brain-enriched mirnas  <cit> . despite this progress, there remains a large gap in our understanding of how the different mirnas expressed during brain development regulate cortical neurogenesis.

a major limitation in the network analysis of genetic circuits is the availability of mrna and mirna profiles from the same cell type. most of the transcriptome and micrornaome data derive from separate studies, typically drawn from examining whole tissues instead of individual cell types, and are often taken at different developmental time points. the present study overcomes these limitations and provides a robust data set for developing new algorithms to detect modulation of target gene expression by mirnas. our objective was to identify mirna and mrna expression patterns that may contribute to the earliest stages of neurogenesis. by obtaining expression-profiling data from highly purified neuronal progenitors, we were able to analyze the dynamic global changes in mirna and mrna expression that occur at the onset of neurogenesis. the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting  and a positive-selection strategy provided the cell purity required for the analysis of neuronal cell populations from a complex tissue, reducing the ambiguity that can be introduced by contaminating cell populations, and eliminated the pitfalls of cell lines and cultured primary cells.

here we provide evidence that a subset of mirnas exhibits expression profiles that are negatively correlated with their predicted target mrnas, and therefore may be part of a gene expression regulatory network that assists in the transition from proliferating neuronal progenitor cells into differentiated neuronal subtypes. in addition, this study identifies a number of candidate transcription factors  that are expressed in the developing telencephalon and may be important in initiating cortical neurogenesis.

RESULTS
facs isolation of neuronal progenitors from the developing telencephalon
we focused on the earliest neuronal progenitors in the rat telencephalon that co-express tetanus toxin and cholera toxin -binding gangliosides on their surface membrane, but lack the expression of the neuronal progenitor markers a2b <dig> and jones , which label a separate pool of progenitors that also generate neurons and later, glial phenotypes. tntx+/chtx+/a2b5-/jones- cells represented  <dig> % of the total number of cells in the rat telencephalon at embryonic day  <dig> ,  <dig> % at e <dig>  and  <dig> % at e <dig>  we have previously defined these tntx+/chtx+/a2b5-/jones- cells as early neuronal progenitors   <cit> . there were not enough enps present at e <dig>  but by e <dig> these cells could be isolated in sufficient numbers to obtain total rna for microarray analysis . at e <dig>  there were enough cells to split the tntx+/chtx+/a2b5-/jones- cells into approximately equal low and high expressing populations, with the latter being defined as late neuronal progenitors , based on their later ontogenetic appearance at e <dig> and progressive accumulation of these cells during late stages of cortical neurogenesis  <cit> . the positively-selected enps and lnps cells were sorted directly into rnalater to preserve rna integrity. the quality of the total rna isolated with this method was confirmed by the presence of intact ribosomal rna bands . after hybridization, the microarray dataset was assessed using principle component analysis. the independent biological replicates clustered together by embryonic days of development . there was little difference in the expression profiles of enps and lnps at e <dig>  as these two populations did not resolve into separate groups. correlation analysis was performed on each group of biological replicates . the correlation coefficient was greater than  <dig>  for the biological replicates at each of the developmental time points, demonstrating a high level of reproducibility among independently obtained replicates.

to provide spatial information on the neuronal progenitor cell population in the developing telencephalon, sagittal sections of e <dig> rat ventral telencephalon were immunostained with anti-nestin, anti-pcna, anti-cdw60/jones and anti-beta-tubulin iii/tuj <dig>  tuj <dig>  was used in place of tntx  to provide better visualization of neuronal cell bodies in the section. four different cell phenotypes were identified using this method . the jones-/tntx+ neuronal progenitors isolated by facs for microarray analysis at e <dig> in this study are represented by jones-/tuj1+ cells , which are predominately located near the pial surface of the ventral telencephalon.

mrnas and mirnas are dynamically regulated during neurogenesis
clustering analysis was used to identify the prevalent gene expression patterns in the data sets. in the mrna microarray experiment, there was little change in the expression level of the vast majority of mrnas represented by the  <dig>  probe sets on the affymetrix microarrays during the developmental period surveyed. only  <dig> % of the probe sets underwent significant changes between e <dig> to e <dig>  the gene lists were obtained using a combination of a statistical filter and a 2-fold change in normalized expression value . there were two dominant gene expression patterns for these mrnas. one class of mrnas was down-regulated as development progressed from e <dig> to e <dig> , while another class of mrnas was up-regulated during this time frame . a parallel result came from the clustering analysis of differentially-regulated mirnas. one class of mirnas was down-regulated and another class up-regulated between e <dig> and e <dig> . there were  <dig> mirnas down-regulated and  <dig> mirnas up-regulated between e <dig> and e <dig> . among the mirnas identified as up-regulated, there were several that have previously been found to be expressed in neuronal progenitors, including mir- <dig> and mir-124a. as was the case for mrnas, the majority of mirnas did not change expression patterns from e <dig> to e <dig> 

before proceeding with a bioinformatic analysis of the datasets, microarray validation was performed using quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  and immunohistochemistry. qrt-pcr was first used to validate mirna expression, and the data confirmed the expression of each of the  <dig> mirnas identified in e <dig> enps . to validate the mrna microarray data, qrt-pcr was used to detect  <dig> tfs that were up-regulated in enps between e <dig> and e <dig>  including onecut, cutl <dig>  myt <dig>  klf <dig>  lhx <dig>  bcl11a and bcl11b . the qrt-pcr results agreed with the microarray data for each of the  <dig> tfs tested. the magnitude of the fold-changes differed, but this likely reflects the difficulty in reproducibly detecting low expression levels of transcripts at e <dig>  an antibody directed against the cutl <dig> protein was used to confirm the protein expression of one of the tfs identified by microarray analysis. cutl <dig> protein expression was detected in the ventral and dorsal telencephalon consistent with the  <dig> -fold increase in cutl <dig> mrna expression in e <dig> enps . additional validation was obtained using the mahoney transcription factor in situ hybridization database  <cit> . in total, sixty tfs were identified as up-regulated in e <dig> enps . of those  <dig> tfs,  <dig> were found in the mahoney database at mouse e <dig>  which is approximately  <dig>  days earlier than the rat e <dig> time-point used in this study. notably,  <dig> of  <dig>  displayed a positive in situ hybridization signal in the mouse telencephalon.

after validation of the microarray dataset, gene ontology  analysis was performed to identify the classes of genes that were being differentially regulated in enps between e <dig> and e <dig>  the  <dig> biological process go categories with the most mrnas in both the down-regulated class , and the up-regulated class  are detailed in figure  <dig>  the most striking finding was the number of mrnas encoding tfs that were identified in both categories of differentially regulated genes . also of note was the number of cell cycle genes that were being down-regulated , and the large number of up-regulated transcripts encoding proteins important for neuronal differentiation .

mirna expression is negatively correlated with predicted target mrna expression
in addition to the identification of genes that may be important during neurogenesis, the mrna and mirna datasets were compared to determine whether there was evidence of differential expression of mirnas influencing mrna expression during the onset of cortical neurogenesis. the predicted targets for each of the mirnas that were differentially regulated were compiled using targetscan  <dig> . the predicted mrna targets were compared to the experimentally-determined, differentially-regulated mrnas to identify the number of predicted mrna targets that actually changed expression levels between e <dig> and e <dig>  a two-tailed fisher's exact test was used to determine whether the number of target mrnas that changed expression was greater than would be expected by chance. the results of this analysis are presented in figure  <dig>  when testing mirnas that were down-regulated,  <dig> of  <dig> mirnas  had a significant number of target mrnas that were up-regulated. mir-199a had significantly less target mrnas up-regulated than would be expected by chance, and was not counted as having an inverse expression pattern. when testing mirnas that were up-regulated,  <dig> of  <dig> mirnas  had a significant number of mrna targets that were down-regulated.

go analysis was performed on the list of predicted target mrnas that were in common with mrnas that were differentially regulated between e <dig> and e <dig>  this analysis compared the mrnas that were predicted to be targeted by mirnas with those mrnas that were experimentally determined to change expression levels. cell migration was the top go category of down-regulated mrnas predicted to be targeted by up-regulated mirnas. moreover, genes regulating neuron differentiation was the top go category of up-regulated mrnas predicted to be targeted by down-regulated mirnas .

network analysis was performed to determine whether different mirnas were predicted to interact with common target mrnas encoding tfs. we used targetscan  <dig>  to predict mirna binding sites in the 3' untranslated region  of the  <dig> up-regulated tfs in e <dig> enps. there were  <dig> predicted mirna binding sites for mirnas that were down-regulated. there were  <dig> mirna predicted binding sites for mirnas that were up-regulated. focusing on the down-regulated mirnas that had a significant negative correlation in figure  <dig>  we performed network analysis and identified mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-291-3p as predicted to target multiple tfs that were up-regulated in e <dig> enps .

discussion
neurogenesis is an extraordinarily complex process that is just beginning to be understood at the molecular level. in this study, we sought to identify genes that are important in regulating the onset of cortical neurogenesis, and to determine whether specific mirnas may be contributing to gene regulation during this developmental period. key to our approach was purifying neuronal progenitor cell populations at the earliest stages of cortical neurogenesis using facs and obtaining the transcriptome and mirnaome profiles of these cells. this study extends our previous work on lineage-negative nscs  <cit> , to now include the positively selected neuronal progenitor progeny of nscs. in the current study, we included two additional lineage-restricted markers  to chtx and jones used in our previous neural cell identification strategy. tntx is a pan-neuronal surface marker that labels early neuronal progenitors and post-mitotic neurons. a2b <dig> is a neuroglial progenitor marker that is retained by early neuronal populations specifically derived from this progenitor . tntx and a2b <dig> have largely overlapping expressions with chtx and jones, respectively. all four markers were used in this study to more stringently discriminate and isolate by facs the tntx+/chtx+ nps derived from a2b5-jones-precursors, which predominate at the onset of cortical neurogenesis, and to minimize contamination from tntx+/chtx+ nps derived from a2b5+jones+ progenitors that increasingly emerge during later cortical development. four independent biological replicates were collected for each time-point with very good reproducibility. using this "-omics" strategy, we identified two major classes of dynamically regulated mrnas and mirnas between embryonic days e <dig> and e <dig>  a developmental period that spans the onset of rat cortical neurogenesis.

the go analysis focused our attention on tfs since mrnas encoding tfs make up the largest class of genes being up-regulated and the second largest class of genes being down-regulated in the dataset. the high number of tfs up-regulated  was not surprising considering the likely heterogeneity of neuronal subpopulations to emerge by e <dig> in the telencephalon. at this stage of development, the telencephalon includes: pioneer neurons, cajal-retzius neurons, tangentially migrating gabaergic neurons, and some of the first pyramidal neurons  <cit> . likewise, a large number of tfs  were down-regulated between e <dig> and e <dig>  we speculate that the diversity of tfs in the proliferating e <dig> neuronal progenitor population may arise from multiple tf expression domains along the rostral-caudal axis of the telencephalon. summary of all the tfs identified here is beyond the scope of this paper, but up-regulated tfs include proteins with previously defined roles in cortical development. for example, the transcription factor bcl11b is up-regulated  <dig> -fold in e <dig> enps and is required for proper axonal projection of corticospinal motor neurons  <cit> . dlx <dig> is up-regulated  <dig> -fold in e <dig> enps, and in transgenic mice lacking both dlx <dig> and dlx <dig>  gabaergic interneurons in the forebrain fail to migrate  <cit> . klf <dig> is up-regulated  <dig> -fold in e <dig> enps, and klf <dig> null mice show a reduction in cortical thickness  <cit> . overall, these results suggest that the novel tfs identified in this study may also be important in regulating cortical development.

mirnas have proven to be important in a number of different developmental processes including the regulation of neuronal progenitors progressing into differentiated neurons  <cit> . in this study, we contribute to the catalog of mirnas that are expressed during mammalian brain development. the developmental time course of this experiment allowed the identification of differentially-expressed mirnas during the earliest stages of cortical neurogenesis between e <dig> and e <dig> 

the expression profiles of both mrnas and mirnas allowed us to ask whether there was a correlation between the expression levels of mirnas and the predicted mrna targets of each mirna. we found that 33% of the mirnas that were down-regulated and 64% of the mirnas that were up-regulated were indeed negatively correlated with the expression pattern of their predicted target mrnas. notably, we found mir- <dig>  mir-291-3p, mir- <dig>  mir-363-3p, mir- <dig>  mir-19a and mir- <dig> as down-regulated mirnas between e <dig> and e <dig> and whose expression was negatively correlated with the expression of their predicted targets. no clear roles for these mirnas have been established yet. of interest on the list of mirnas that were down-regulated between e <dig> and e <dig> was the mir- <dig> family, which is expressed by embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . the number of mrnas down-regulated between e <dig> and e <dig> encoding proteins involved in cell cycle regulation , and the expression of mir- <dig>  mir-291-3p, and mir-292-3p, are interpreted as an indication of the proliferative phenotype of the e <dig> enps, which likely contain cells that are only a cell division away from neural stem cells. we also found up-regulated mirnas between e <dig> and e <dig> belonging to a well-characterized category of brain-enriched mirnas. these include mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-124a, mir-125a/b, mir-181b/c and mir-99a/b. interestingly, mir- <dig>  mir-124a, mir-99a/b and mir-181b/c up-regulation during early cortical neurogenesis was negatively correlated with the expression level of their predicted targets, consistent with reports that have found a negative expression correlation between tissue-enriched mirnas and their putative targets  <cit> . some brain-enriched mirnas have also been reported to be co-expressed with their target genes  <cit> . the complexity of the mammalian nervous system may give rise to these disparate findings, which could be caused by differences in developmental time points examined or differences in cell types used in the analysis.

currently, mammalian mirnas are not thought to be a primary gene regulatory mechanism. rather, mammalian mirnas are thought to act more by fine-tuning the changes of gene expression that are largely under transcriptional control  <cit> . we speculate that the negative correlation between mirnas expression and the predicted target mrna expression identified in this study may be an indication that these tissue enriched mirnas help to fine-tune transcriptional control by post-transcriptionally modulating the levels of their target mrnas. experimental validation of mirna-target mrna interaction is required to confirm this hypothesis.

the mechanisms by which mirnas degrade their targets are not well characterized. there may be cooperation between translation inhibition and mrna degradation involving deadenylase and decapping complexes  <cit> . in a rare example in which mirna directs slicer-mediated cleavage of the target, a high degree of complementarity exists between the mirna and its binding site in the 3'utr  <cit> . since mammalian mirnas interact with their targets using less extensive base pairing in the binding site, our data support the fine-tuning model for tissue-enriched mirnas and leave open the possibility that mirnas employ mrna degradation more often than currently recognized, through yet uncharacterized mechanisms.

the negative correlation between mirnas and predicted target mrnas expression identified in this study supports the hypothesis that mirnas may be modulating the expression of genes required during cortical neurogenesis. further support for this hypothesis was provided by the go analysis of the differentially regulated mrnas that were classified as predicted targets of mirnas. notably, mrnas that were down-regulated and predicted to be targeted by up-regulated mirnas were enriched in mrnas encoding proteins involved with cell migration . one of these mrnas was cxcr <dig>  which is down-regulated  <dig> -fold and is predicted to be targeted by mir- <dig>  which was up-regulated over a hundred fold. since cxcr <dig> is required for radial and tangential migration in the developing cortex  <cit> , we speculate that the up-regulated mirnas identified in this study may help dampen the expression of genes no longer required as neuronal differentiation progresses, as has been previously suggested  <cit> .

the mrna encoding the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1c  was up-regulated 3-fold in e <dig> enps and is predicted to be targeted by three mirnas that were down-regulated: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-363-3p. cdkn1c has been reported to negatively regulate proliferation of cortical progenitors by inhibiting the cell cycle progression machinery  <cit> . it is thus tempting to hypothesize that the down-regulated mirnas identified in this study may act as progenitor maintenance factors helping to prevent aberrant or leaky expression of genes that would interfere with the proper timing of cortical neurogenesis. additional support for this hypothesis was provided by the mirna-tf mrna network analysis in figure  <dig>  we found four down-regulated mirnas  that were predicted to target multiple tfs, which were up-regulated in e <dig> enps. the importance of keeping pro-neural tfs silenced in neuronal progenitors may explain tf targeting by multiple mirnas. these findings are consistent with a role for mirnas helping to regulate the transition from the proliferative and migratory phenotype of neuronal progenitors into differentiating neurons. confirmation of the role of mirnas in the regulation of neurogenesis awaits functional studies using loss and gain of function experiments.

there were differentially regulated mirnas identified in this study that did not have a negative correlation, and there were two mirnas  that had a significant positive correlation with predicted target mrnas. the lack of negative correlation could be caused by inaccuracies in mirna target prediction or by a translational inhibition mechanism rather than rna degradation, which would prevent detection with mrna microarrays. the detection of mirnas with a positive correlation between the mirna and target mrna  suggests some alternative indirect mechanisms or a positive regulatory role for mirnas, as has been reported for some genes involved in cell cycle regulation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate cortical neurogenesis will require the identification of genes with the correct spatial and temporal expression patterns. in this study, we report the mrna and mirna expression profiles of the first neuronal progenitors in the developing telencephalon, and provide a catalog of tfs likely to play a role in telencephalon development. in addition, we show that the expression of many dynamically regulated mirnas are negatively correlated with the expression of their predicted target mrnas. the complexity of cortical development may require additional levels of gene regulation, and the mirnas identified in this study are well positioned to regulate gene expression during the transition from neuronal progenitors into differentiated neurons.
