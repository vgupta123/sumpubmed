BACKGROUND
urine is formed via the filtration of plasma by glomeruli in the kidneys, which act as a filter to retain most of the proteins present in the plasma  <cit> . because urine collection is non-invasive, low in cost and convenient and because urine is stable compared with other biofluids, urine is advantageous for various clinical applications, such as disease diagnosis, prognosis and guidance of treatment  <cit> . from a proteomic standpoint, urine can provide proteins for proteomic profile of specific physiological conditions, such as pregnancy, that may be suitable for clinical applications  <cit> . the urinary proteome has been investigated in several previous studies that have employed different approaches, particularly involving developments in mass spectrometry  with high resolution and accuracy at both the ms and ms/ms levels  <cit> .

as it is well known, pregnancy affects protein expression in maternal serum and urine. furthermore, quantitative differences in protein expression have been detected during pregnancy, which have been useful for the detection of biomarkers for pregnancy-related conditions, such as the identification of fetuses with down syndrome and preeclampsia, among others  <cit> . protein phosphorylation is a dynamic and reversible modification involved in most cell regulatory processes  <cit> . the determination of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation at certain sites is helpful to understand the mechanism of certain regulatory pathways  <cit> . therefore, appreciable efforts have been made toward the analysis of the proteome and phosphoproteome. analysis of phosphopeptides requires their specific enrichment from unmodified peptides, as well as their fractionation, which reduces the sample complexity. unmodified peptides tend to elute in the flow-through using methods that selectively enrich the concentration of modified peptides  <cit> . recently, a method using a nano-liquid chromatography  configuration featuring low void volume, highly reproducible chromatographic separation and a long, shallow chromatographic gradient was developed to separate highly complex tryptic peptide mixture without pre-fractionation  <cit> . the resulting peptides were sufficiently resolved by a 5 h gradient using an ltq orbitrap analyzer for protein identification and quantification. this method demonstrates that the combination of long-gradient ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography  with high resolution ms at increased sequencing speeds enables extensive proteomic analysis in single runs  <cit> .

in the present study, urine samples from pregnant volunteers in their third trimester  and one month after vaginal delivery were separated by 1-d sds-page. each lane was cut into  <dig> bands, and the gel slices were digested with trypsin. the resulting peptides were then separated by reversed-phase  lc and analyzed using a ltq orbitrap velos to improve the identification coverage and reliability. in total,  <dig> proteins, including  <dig> from the urine of pregnant volunteers and  <dig> from the urine of non-pregnant volunteers, were identified. furthermore, using mtraq labeling followed by lc-ms/ms for the quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis,  <dig> phosphopeptides were detected, representing  <dig> phosphoproteins. statistical significance was determined using a student’s t-test and  <dig> phosphopeptides corresponding to  <dig> proteins were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the urine of pregnant volunteers. taken together, the results of this study represent the most comprehensive proteomic characterization of human urine to date. the use of quantitative proteomic approaches to investigate changes in phosphoprotein expression could provide insights into the mechanisms of pregnancy maintenance; potentially contributing to the development of specific and sensitive diagnostic strategies for pregnancy-related conditions.

RESULTS
identification of urinary proteins
the proteome of urinary samples collected just prior to and one month after vaginal delivery from  <dig> pregnant women was analyzed and compared using a combined sds-page/lc-ms/ms. because the normal total protein concentration in urine is very low, various sample preparation procedures, including centrifugation, dialysis, affinity enrichment and precipitation using organic solvents, have previously been used  <cit> . here we used a 3 kda membrane ultrafiltration unit to minimize protein loss and, more importantly, remove low molecular weight polypeptides, which are abundant in human urine samples  <cit> . the urine samples were concentrated approximately 100-fold using the ultrafiltration unit and then treated with sodium deoxycholate and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid  to concentrate the urine proteins. as this approach enabled us to treat the urine samples in a large volume and reduce the concentration time, protein degradation was consequently decreased  <cit> . the concentrated proteins from the pooled samples were then separated by sds-page, and the gel was cut into  <dig> bands . digests from each band were desalted and analyzed by lc-ms/ms.

from the pooled urine samples from pregnant women obtained just before vaginal delivery, we obtained  <dig> unique peptides, representing  <dig> proteins. for the urine samples obtained one month after vaginal delivery from the same women, we unambiguously identified  <dig> unique peptides, representing  <dig> proteins. in total, from the urine samples obtained from these women before and after vaginal delivery, we obtained  <dig> proteins  after the removal of redundant proteins. on average, more than  <dig> peptides were used to identify each protein, and the amino acid sequence coverage was approximately  <dig> %.

interestingly,  <dig> peptides representing  <dig> proteins were identified in urine samples of women both before  and after  vaginal delivery . additionally,  <dig> and  <dig> peptides were unique to pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively, while  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were unique to these groups, respectively. figure  <dig> indicates the distribution of the peptides and proteins identified from the two sample sets. the complete list of peptides and proteins identified in the present study is provided in additional file 1: table s1a.

molecular weight and pi distributions of the identifications
the theoretical mr distribution for the identified proteins ranged from  <dig>  kda to  <dig>  kda  and is depicted in figure 2a. the majority of the proteins were in the range between  <dig> and 70 kda, representing approximately  <dig> %  of all the identified proteins. the molecular weight distribution of the urinary proteins during pregnancy was similar to that during non-pregnancy. interestingly,  <dig> proteins with a relative high molecular weight  were detected in this study, indicating that the identification of high molecular weight proteins may benefit from a thorough gel separation. in contrast, only  <dig> %  of the low molecular weight proteins  were identified. because proteins with higher molecular weight may generate more peptides than lower weight proteins after digestion with trypsin, it is presumed that the latter might be masked by the former  <cit> .

the pi scores for the identified proteins ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , and a detailed pi distribution is illustrated in figure 2b. out of all the identifications, it was clear that the majority of the proteins clustered around a pi of 5– <dig>  which is similar to the total proteome. there were only two proteins with pi scores over  <dig> 

functional classification of the identifications
the proteins identified were classified according to gene ontology. the classification based on cellular component  revealed that the majority of the proteins are known to be either plasma membrane  or present on the cytoplasm . we also identified a number of organelle proteins  that are known to be on nucleus , lysosomal lumen , mitochondrion , golgi apparatus  and vesicular exosome  et al. in terms of molecular function , the majority of the proteins are categorized into groups involved in binding , catalytic activity , enzyme regulator activity , structural molecule activity  and receptor activity . in binding group, the proteins were involved in ion binding , protein binding , atp and gtp binding , carbohydrate binding  and dna binding  et al. in catalytic activity group, the proteins were involved in hydrolase activity  and oxidoreductase activity  and serine-type endopeptidase activity  et al. the proteins were also classified based on biological process into those involved in metabolic process , biological regulation , cellular process , localization , cellular component organization or biogenesis  and immune system process . additionally, 7% of the proteins were unknown proteins .

comparison with other studies on urinary proteomes
a numbers of studies have been performed to characterize the urinary proteome in healthy individuals  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the major studies carried out to date. by comparing our results with previous urinary proteomic studies, we found that  <dig> of the proteins identified here overlapped with those in previous studies. it should be noted that inter-individual differences likely account for some of the observed variability in the proteomes, particularly for urine samples during pregnancy and non-pregnancy, and thus the overlap is relatively low. therefore, there are  <dig> proteins not reported by the others studies at the proteome level that are unique to our study. these unique proteins were indicated in blue font in additional file 1: table s1d.

phosphoproteomic analysis of urine samples
recently, technical approaches that allow for phosphoproteomic profiling with long gradient lc-ms have been introduced  <cit> . we used this strategy to identify phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites present in urine samples. in total,  <dig> phosphopeptides  with  <dig> phosphorylation sites were confidently identified, representing  <dig> phosphoproteins . of the unique phosphopeptides, 62% were mono-phosphorylated peptides, 23% were di-phosphorylated peptides and 15% were multi-phosphorylated  peptides. interestingly, five phosphopeptides had six phosphorylation sites. additionally, of the  <dig> phosphorylation sites, 70%  were phosphorylated at serine, 22%  at threonine and 8%  at tyrosine residue. the distribution of phospho-amino acids in the present study is consistent with other urinary proteomic studies  <cit> .

for the mtraq-based quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis, the phosphopeptides that passed t-test with p-value <  <dig>  and log <dig> fold change values ≥ <dig>  or ≤ − <dig>   were considered to be significantly regulated. therefore, average normalized ratios were used for the proteins ratios, and a cutoff value of  <dig> -fold was chosen as the threshold for screening significantly changed proteins. in total,  <dig> unique phosphopeptides corresponding to  <dig> proteins were found to be differentially expressed, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and two were down-regulated in urinary samples from women just before vaginal delivery. additional file 3: table s <dig> shows the phosphoproteins corresponding to peptides that were significantly altered.

discussion
recent advances in proteomics, particularly developments in ms with high resolution and accuracy levels, have allowed for unprecedented discovery of the composition of human urine and the application of this knowledge to the study of human physiology and disease biomarker. in the current study, we used urine samples to understand protein expression patterns and the maintenance of these expression patterns during pregnancy compared with the non-pregnant state. in contrast to conventional biomedical approaches, which can only monitor one or a small number of specific proteins at a time, we combined extensive gel fractionation with high resolution and accuracy ltq orbitrap-ms/ms, which can measure protein expression levels directly and provide insight into the activity state of all of relevant proteins under different physiological conditions.

initially, we constructed a protein profile map of urine obtained from ten healthy pregnant women and the same non-pregnant women following delivery. protein identification data reported here is the largest catalog of proteins from the urinary proteome identified in a single study to date. we believe that this result is likely the result of employing multiple gel pre-fractionations , which decreased the complexity of the sample  <cit> . furthermore, we used a ltq orbitrap velos with high resolution and accuracy settings at both the ms and ms/ms levels, while many of the earlier studies were performed on other instruments with lower resolutions and sensitivities. additionally, we integrated cid and hcd fragmentation mode ms analysis to give the highest number of peptide identifications  <cit> .

different proteins observed in urine samples are likely due to differences physiologies state of pregnancy and non-pregnancy. in agreement with previous studies, we observed a relative enrichment of the urinary proteome with respect to different physiologies in pregnancy versus non-pregnancy. a total of  <dig> proteins were found to be unique to pregnant women. these unique proteins may provide insight into the biomarkers present under pregnant conditions. for example, annexins are known to be abundant in placental membranes; some of these proteins were detectable during pregnancy with a 4-fold peak change in expression. the high expression of annexin  <dig> was maintained during pregnancy  <cit> . therefore, usage of advanced ms methods for the study of human urine promises to offer significant insights into human physiology and its application to the diagnosis of pregnancy.

to date, little information on the phosphoproteomic changes that occur during pregnancy has been obtained. furthermore, most previous studies did not follow the changes over time from pre- to post-vaginal delivery as we have performed here. the aim of this study was to investigate the total protein expression patterns and phosphoprotein expression changes just before and after vaginal delivery and to identify the proteins that are important for maintaining pregnancy. for each mtraq experiment, we also combined cid and hcd data to derive a set of unique phosphopeptides. in addition to providing quantitative information , hcd fragmentation also gave a significant number of unique phosphopeptides  <cit> . as a result, however, the amount of material available for each condition  was limited to approximately 100 μg according to the manufacturer’s protocol , resulting in a total of approximately 400 μg of labeled peptides after pooling the two samples into a single mtraq set. this is a significant departure from conventional phosphoproteomic studies, which typically involve large amounts of starting material , thus allowing for extensive peptide fractionation in ms analysis. hence, our experimental approach was constrained to phosphopeptide enrichment followed by a mtraq labeling strategy due to the limited samples availability. although some single phosphoproteomic analyses using urinary samples have been published  <cit> , no phosphoproteomic differential expression analyses employing highly specialized states  have been conducted to our knowledge. thus, our data represent one of the first large-scale phosphoproteomic studies using urine samples from healthy women before and after vaginal delivery.

the number of unique phosphopeptides, phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites identified in this study was particularly impressive considering the limited amount of starting material. some of these phosphoproteins are pivotal in the maintenance of pregnancy and may play diverse functional roles. for instance, alpha-2-hs-glycoprotein  is a 49 kda protein that plays a role in host defense and bone metabolism  <cit> . this protein is one of the major components of the non-collagenous bone matrix, particularly in the fetuses. ahsg must be phosphorylated to be physiologically active in mammals, and it has been shown that the non-phosphorylated version exerts minimal or no effects  <cit> . three distinct phosphorylated peptides and two phosphorylation sites, ser <dig> and ser <dig>  were found in the present study . compared with samples from non-pregnant women , samples from women in their third trimester of pregnancy had ahsg concentrations that were significantly increased . additionally, it was reported that the concentration of this protein was also significantly higher in the third trimester compared with the first and second and with the non-pregnant controls  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate on the biological significance of this protein in pregnancy, during which its concentration increases. another key factor, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine-like protein  <dig> , an extracelluar matrix glycoprotein, is implicated in many physiological functions  <cit> . sparcl <dig> is overexpressed in many tumors of the digestive tract  <cit> , and turtoi et al. reported that sparcl <dig> is a new marker of human glioma progression  <cit> . although sparcl <dig> levels are low in the placenta  <cit> , a significant increase  of this protein in urine was observed during the third trimester of pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy. here three unique phosphorylated peptides and three phosphorylation sites were found to map to the protein . interestingly, all of the phosphorylation sites were on serine residues . additionally, secreted phosphoprotein one , also known as osteopontin , is an acidic single chain phosphorylated glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix  <cit> . human urine contains different forms of opn, which is subjected to significant posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, sulfation and glycosylation  <cit> . the intact protein in urine contains approximately eight phosphate groups distributed over  <dig> phosphorylation sites. here, among twenty distinct phosphorylation sites detected in the present study, ser <dig> and ser <dig> were consistent with the above report  <cit> , whereas the additional ser <dig> was previously described in human milk  <cit> . thirteen phosphosites  were also reported elsewhere in urine  <cit> . finally, seven novel phosphosites  were detected for the first time in this study.

other phosphoproteins, such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein  <dig> , liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide  <dig> , three prime repair exonuclease  <dig>  and high affinity copper uptake protein  <dig> , were also found to be significantly altered in this study. these differentially expressed phosphoproteins might participate in maintaining a successful normal pregnancy.

CONCLUSIONS
our results represented a comprehensive proteomic profile and the phosphoprotein expression pattern of urine samples during before and after vaginal delivery. a subset of the identified proteins may have important roles in maintaining a normal, successful pregnancy and may be useful for preventing pregnancy failure by comparing a patient’s expression profile with those under pathological conditions known to cause pregnancy failure. although we have only identified a limited number of phosphoproteins , these preliminary data present the possibility for a phosphoproteomic study and an evaluation of the significance of the protein changes observed during pregnancy. further study will be needed to elucidate the specific involvement of differentially expressed proteins during pregnancy, and certainly, other supplementary methods will be needed to confirm these findings.
