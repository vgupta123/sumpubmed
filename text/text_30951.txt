BACKGROUND
the diploid yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes mitosis in glucose medium. upon transfer to acetate sporulation medium, cells commit to meiosis, a division process that produces four spores  <cit> . meiotic initiation involves a sequential activation of signaling molecules. importantly, expression of these molecules occurs transiently within a short time window  <cit> , suggesting that protein turnover and modification are under tight regulation. these short-lived signals are important for efficient entry and successful completion of meiosis  <cit> . further, interactions among these signaling molecules can lead to different levels of sporulation efficiency, as seen from yeast strains with distinct mutations or genetic background  <cit> . understanding how the transient signals are generated and trigger sporulation at different efficiency represents an important first step in the development of new strategies for producing gametes with high quality and quantity.

many key players and their interactions that control yeast meiotic initiation have now been identified   <cit> . ime <dig>  the master transcriptional activator for early genes, is regulated by multiple input signals. ime <dig> is repressed in the presence of glucose and activated by acetate and nitrogen depletion  <cit> . when glucose is present, ime <dig> expression is inhibited by sok <dig>  which is phosphorylated by protein kinase a . under meiotic conditions, pka activity is reduced, resulting in dephosphorylation of sok <dig> and, thereby, the release of inhibition on ime <dig>  <cit> . ime <dig> positively auto-regulates its own expression, potentially by inhibiting sok <dig> activity  <cit> . ime <dig> is also regulated by g <dig> cyclins , which reduce ime <dig> transcription and prevent ime <dig> accumulation in the nucleus  <cit> . in contrast, transcriptional activators msn2/ <dig> promote ime <dig> expression in the presence of acetate  <cit> . similarly, snf <dig>  a kinase in the glucose repression pathway, stimulates expression of ime <dig> <cit> .

inactivation of pka under meiotic conditions leads to enhanced activity of rim <dig>  a kinase that phosphorylates ime <dig> and ume <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation stabilizes the ume6-ime <dig> complex, which is recruited to the promoters of early meiotic genes such as ime <dig> to activate their expression  <cit> . ime <dig> is a kinase and functions as a positive regulator for premeiotic dna replication and nuclear division  <cit> . ime <dig> plays an important role in terminating expression of early meiotic genes through promoting proteolytic degradation of ime <dig>  <cit> . this negative regulation ensures that ime <dig> is only expressed within a narrow time window. in addition, ime <dig> transcriptionally activates its own expression via upstream activation sequences  <cit> . this positive auto-regulation allows ime <dig> to activate middle meiotic genes independent of ime <dig>  further, mutual antagonism between ime <dig> and g <dig> cyclins  may be responsible for distinct response modes of meiotic genes to ime <dig> levels  <cit> .

ndt <dig> encodes a transcription factor that activates expression of mid-meiosis genes  <cit> . the phosphorylated ime1-ume <dig> complex is insufficient to activate ndt <dig> due to the presence of a repressor, sum <dig>  on its promoter. ime <dig> can activate expression of ndt <dig> by eliminating sum1-mediated repression  <cit> . ime <dig> further phosphorylates ndt <dig>  allowing ndt <dig> to promote its own expression by competing with sum <dig> for binding on the promoter  <cit> . in turn, ndt <dig> is a transcriptional activator of ime <dig>  ndt <dig> boosts ime <dig> activity during the middle stage of sporulation  <cit> , and premature transcription of ndt <dig> induces transcription of ime <dig> <cit> .

because of complex feedback regulation on the meiotic initiation pathway, mathematical modeling becomes an important tool to understand dynamic behaviors of signaling molecules and how their interactions ensure different degrees of sporulation efficiency. feedback controls, which link the output of a circuit back to its input, are a key mechanism to stabilize cell-fate decision. both experimental data and computational modeling suggest important roles of feedback loops in regulating mitotic entry and exit, cell growth, cell cycle, and pheromone pathways  <cit> . negative feedback loops can generate oscillations or monotonic dynamics, while positive or double-negative feedback loops can produce bistability, i.e., having two coexisting stable steady states  <cit> . in the case of stronger positive or double-negative feedback loops, bistability can further lead to irreversibility, where a cell is locked in the post-transition state even after the stimulus disappears  <cit> . likewise, feedback loops may be responsible for transient dynamics of early meiotic proteins and different sporulation outcomes.

boolean network models—a discrete method—have been developed to simulate the dynamics of meiotic initiation pathways. one study focuses on predicting sporulation efficiency upon gene deletions, and the other explains transient transcription of ime <dig> and ime <dig> by introducing two hypothetical repressors to shut down gene expression  <cit> . here, we develop an ordinary differential equation  model, a continuous method, to faithfully describe the nonlinear temporal dynamics of meiotic initiation pathways, incorporating numeric values of protein expression, kinetic rates, and time. the model depicts a signaling cascade of early meiotic proteins. importantly, the model illustrates phosphorylation reactions and feedback loops that are crucial for directing the initiation of meiosis, based on the current knowledge available in the literature. the model correctly captures transient dynamics of meiotic proteins and accurately produces sporulation phenotypes of single-gene knockouts. we apply this model to investigate the contribution of feedback loops to transient behaviors of signaling molecules and sporulation efficiency.

RESULTS
a signaling pathway that controls yeast meiotic initiation
we construct a signaling pathway to describe the initial phase of yeast meiosis based on the literature . the pathway includes rim <dig>  pume <dig> , psok <dig>  ime <dig>  pime <dig>  and ime <dig>  protein synthesis, degradation, phosphorylation, and feedback regulations are depicted in the pathway . rim <dig>  ume <dig>  and sok <dig> change their phosphorylation formalism in response to external nutrients. under meiotic conditions, reduced activity of pka results in dephosphorylation of rim <dig> and sok <dig>  rim <dig> further mediates phosphorylation of ume <dig> and ime <dig>  ime <dig> is the master regulator of meiotic initiation. a double-negative feedback loop exists between ime <dig> and psok <dig>  ime <dig> and pume <dig> together induce ime <dig> expression. subsequently, ime <dig> down-regulates ime <dig> through a negative feedback loop and up-regulates itself through a positive feedback loop. this signaling pathway has been converted into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe the rate of change of proteins over time . the mathematical model allows for a systematic analysis of interactions between signaling molecules and how these interactions lead to different meiotic outcomes.

the constructed model is an abstract of real pathways, incorporating major players and events. the effects of other molecules are reflected indirectly in the model. for example, we assume pka remains constant at a low level under meiotic conditions  <cit> ; the effects of upstream regulators of ime <dig>  are collectively represented by a general activation signal and a repression signal through psok2; mutual inhibition between ime <dig> and cln3/cdc <dig> and mutual activation between ime <dig> and ndt <dig> are both captured by positive auto-regulation of ime <dig> 

using mitotic initial conditions  and baseline parameter values , we simulate the time-dependent dynamics of early meiotic proteins . the model readily generates the pattern of protein expression that is consistent with experimental evidence  <cit> . we find that early meiotic proteins are induced in a sequential and transient manner. the decline of psok <dig> occurs concurrently with the rise of rim <dig> and pume <dig>  both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ime <dig> exhibit a transient expression peak around six hours, after which ime <dig> reaches its highest expression level before decreases. at the steady state, rim <dig> and pume <dig> remain highly expressed, while the levels of all other proteins drop from their peak values . in fact, the system evolves to this steady state regardless of initial conditions , suggesting that a single, stable steady state exists for the ode model. this is further confirmed by the bifurcation analysis described later .

model validation by sporulation-deficient and proficient genes
high-throughput screens of ~ <dig>  yeast deletion strains have identified  <dig> genes required for sporulation  and  <dig> genes whose disruption enhances sporulation efficiency   <cit> . our mathematical model describes temporal dynamics of meiotic proteins encoded by five genes, among which rim <dig>  ume <dig>  ime <dig>  and ime <dig> are sporulation-deficient genes and sok <dig> is a sporulation-proficient gene. because the sporulation data are distinct from those used for model building, they can be applied for evaluating model performance. we virtually delete each of the five genes from the wild type model and simulate temporal dynamics of proteins in these knockout models .

ime <dig> is used as the model readout for sporulation phenotypes because it is the most downstream protein that reflects changes in all others in the pathway. we find that ime <dig> levels remain at zero in the knockout models of sporulation-deficient genes rim <dig>  ume <dig>  ime <dig>  and ime <dig> . virtual deletion of ime <dig> results in non-transient expression of ime <dig> , consistent with previous experimental observation  <cit> . in contrast, for the knockout model of sok <dig>  a sporulation-proficient gene, ime <dig> exhibits damped oscillations and enhanced expression compared to the wild type model . to further quantitatively evaluate the ode model for sporulation phenotypes, we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between experimentally determined sporulation/pre-sporulation ratios and simulated steady state levels of ime <dig> for five gene knockouts and wild type . significant correlation is observed between the measured and predicted sporulation efficiency . these results suggest that the mathematical model correctly captures sporulation phenotypes of single-gene deletions. once the model is validated, we can then use the model to explain and predict the role of feedback loops in regulating sporulation efficiency and transient behaviors of signaling molecules. noteworthily, the constructed model  may be one of many models that could generate protein dynamics and knockout phenotypes in agreement with experimental evidences. the identification of other potential models requires scanning all possible topologies linking the six proteins that can satisfy the current knowledge of yeast meiosis.

a global analysis of parameter sensitivity
when in silico models include a large number of parameters describing biological processes, it is critical to understand the role of each parameter in variations of model outcome. sensitivity analysis is used to investigate which parameters have the greatest influence on model output. it can help identify key parameters—and, thus, the associated biological processes—that determine distinct outcomes. we perform multi-parametric sensitivity analysis on the ode model  <cit> . the response of six variables is examined by simultaneously varying all  <dig> parameters in the model over a wide range of choices. sensitivity is in the range of  <dig> and 1; more important parameters are associated with larger sensitivity values .

the overall pattern indicates that early meiotic proteins are sensitive to parameters that directly regulate their homeostasis. levels of rim <dig>  pume <dig>  and psok <dig> are mainly affected by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. rim <dig> and psok <dig> are more sensitive to dephosphorylation than phosphorylation , but the opposite is true for pume <dig> . the findings are consistent with the active forms of these proteins in meiosis. synthesis and phosphorylation are most important to alter the ime <dig> level ; both processes directly determine the gain or loss of ime <dig>  the level of pime <dig> is primarily modulated by the synthesis of ime <dig> and degradation of ime <dig> . ime <dig> synthesis indirectly controls pime <dig> through regulating ime1; ime <dig> degradation indirectly influences pime <dig> through ime2-activated ime <dig> degradation. parameters that control ime <dig> auto-regulation and degradation have the greatest influence on ime <dig> variations .

feedback loops control transient expression of signaling molecules
feedback regulations are important for coordinated and transient behaviors of developmental systems  <cit> . ime <dig> and ime <dig> exhibit orderly and transient expression during meiosis . these short-lived signals are critical for the successful completion of sporulation  <cit> . we investigate how feedback loops affect dynamics of early meiotic proteins. a total of three feedback loops are described in the model: double-negative feedback between psok <dig> and ime <dig>  negative feedback from ime <dig> to ime <dig>  and auto-positive feedback of ime <dig> . we up-regulate, down-regulate, or delete each feedback loop through manipulating corresponding parameters. protein dynamics are monitored in these in silico perturbation experiments.


double-negative feedback between psok <dig> and ime1

phosphorylated sok <dig> is an upstream repressor of ime <dig>  and, conversely, ime <dig> inhibits sok <dig> phosphorylation, forming a double-negative feedback loop. we first evaluate the effect of inhibition from psok <dig> to ime <dig>  by varying cime <dig>  the constant measuring half-maximum inhibition of ime <dig> synthesis by psok <dig> . when this inhibition is enhanced , no expression is observed for ime <dig> and ime2; the entire meiotic pathway is turned off. when this inhibition is partially or completely relieved , damped oscillations appear for both ime <dig> and ime <dig>  and ime <dig> reaches a higher steady state than wild type. next, we evaluate the inhibition from ime <dig> to psok <dig>  by varying csok <dig>  the constant measuring half-maximum inhibition of sok <dig> phosphorylation by ime <dig> . manipulating the inhibition toward psok <dig> produces the opposite effect: increasing the inhibition  activates the meiotic pathway, while decreasing or dismissing the inhibition  represses the pathway. we further investigate the feedback loop by simultaneously varying cime <dig> and csok <dig> . the results are similar to those from manipulating the inhibition from psok <dig> to ime <dig>  in particular, the feedback knockout results in enhanced ime <dig> expression . the orderly and transient behavior of both ime <dig> and ime <dig>  however, are not affected by manipulating the different arm of feedback loop or the entire feedback loop.


negative feedback from ime <dig> to ime1

protein destruction is a commonly used mechanism controlling cell cycle transitions  <cit> . ime <dig> activates ime <dig>  while ime <dig> inhibits ime <dig> by promoting its degradation. previous studies indicate that negative feedback loops are required for transient transcription of ime <dig> <cit> . we test whether negative feedback from ime <dig> to ime <dig> is responsible for confining expression of early meiotic proteins to a narrow window. when increasing d’ime <dig>  the maximum rate of ime2-activated ime <dig> degradation, the negative feedback is enhanced . both amplitude and duration of ime <dig> peak decrease, which lead to no expression of ime <dig> . when the feedback is reduced or dismissed by changing d’ime <dig> , we observe not only increased peak height but also increased peak width for both ime <dig> and ime <dig>  ime <dig> rises to infinity in the feedback knockout model . the negative feedback can also be manipulated by varying c <dig>  the constant measuring half-maximum activation of ime <dig> degradation by ime <dig> , or by varying d’ime <dig> and c <dig> simultaneously . the results are similar to those of changing d’ime <dig>  suggesting that the negative feedback ensures transient expression of both ime <dig> and ime <dig> 


auto-positive feedback of ime2

multiple lines of evidence support positive auto-regulation of ime2: transcriptional activation of its own expression  <cit> , mutual antagonism between ime <dig> and g <dig> cyclins   <cit> , and mutual activation between ime <dig> and ndt <dig>  <cit> . to examine the role of auto-regulation in protein dynamics, we vary s’ime <dig>  the maximum rate of auto-regulation-dependent ime <dig> synthesis , c <dig>  the constant measuring half-maximum activation of ime <dig> synthesis through auto-regulation , or both . up-regulation of the feedback  causes earlier decline of ime <dig> peak and earlier increase of ime <dig> to a higher level than wild type. the abrupt drop of ime <dig> is due to negative feedback from enhanced expression of ime <dig>  ime <dig> is more sensitive to variations in s’ime <dig> than in c <dig>  consistent with the global analysis of parameter sensitivity . when auto-positive feedback is down-regulated or deleted , both ime <dig> and ime <dig> exhibit similar dynamics as for wild type . these results indicate that the auto-regulation is responsible for transient ime <dig> expression. the transient dynamics of ime <dig>  however, are preserved regardless of the strength of auto-regulation.

feedback loops control sporulation efficiency
feedback regulations are known to control cell fate decision  <cit> . in the context of yeast meiosis, feedback loops linking early proteins may be responsible for distinct sporulation efficiencies, traced by steady state levels of ime <dig>  the most downstream protein in the model. we perform bifurcation analyses on parameters governing feedback loops to determine which ones cause changes in the stability of ime <dig> equilibrium.


double-negative feedback between psok <dig> and ime1

mutual antagonism between psok <dig> and ime <dig> is controlled by cime <dig> and csok <dig>  half-maximum inhibition constants. varying either cime <dig> or csok <dig> produces two stable steady states separated by an unstable steady state . when both parameters are close to their baseline values , the default equilibrium value of ime <dig> is obtained . when cime <dig> increases or csok <dig> decreases, implying that ime <dig> wins over psok <dig>  ime <dig> reaches a higher stable state. this higher state indicates that sporulation efficiency can be improved by manipulating double-negative feedback loop between psok <dig> and ime <dig> 

pka mediates phosphorylation of sok <dig> and rim <dig>  to examine whether pka is also a bifurcation parameter, we vary the phosphorylation rates of sok <dig> and rim <dig> simultaneously . two stable steady states, separated by an unstable steady state, are again observed. one stable state is the default equilibrium value of ime <dig>  when pka activity is reduced, represented by lowering phosphorylation rates, the second stable state of higher ime <dig> appears, corresponding to elevated sporulation efficiency. this result suggests that sporulation efficiency can also be improved by suppressing pka activity.


negative feedback from ime <dig> to ime1

parameter c <dig> is the half-maximum constant of ime <dig> inhibition on ime <dig>  changing c <dig> results in two stable steady states, separated by a very short segment of unstable steady state . baseline value  leads to the default ime <dig> equilibrium . the inhibition from ime <dig> to ime <dig> decreases with the increase of c <dig>  producing enhanced ime <dig> level. this indicates that sporulation efficiency can be improved by repressing negative feedback from ime <dig> to ime <dig> 


auto-positive feedback of ime2

auto-regulation of ime <dig> is approximated by a hill function with the coefficient of  <dig>  we use high hill coefficient to define cooperative and ultrasensitive regulatory processes because this feedback loop represents not only auto-regulation but also multiple interactions between ime <dig> and other molecules . parameter c <dig> is the half-maximum constant of ime <dig> auto-regulation. plotting ime <dig> as a function of c <dig>  shows the default ime <dig> equilibrium  at baseline parameter value . when c <dig> is less than  <dig> , the auto-regulation is enhanced, which leads to a higher steady state response of ime <dig>  with c <dig> in the region of  <dig> - <dig> , the system becomes bistable. ime <dig> can take two different values, characterizing states of default and higher sporulation efficiency. these two stable states can be reached for the same set of parameters depending on initial conditions.

the hill coefficient determines the switch-like behavior of ime <dig> equilibrium. we find that the range of c <dig> in which the system exhibits bistability is sensitive to the hill coefficient . the system is monostable with coefficients of  <dig> or  <dig>  since one value of c <dig> corresponds to a single value of ime <dig>  higher coefficients result in the transition from a monostable to a bistable system. a hill coefficient of  <dig> expands the region of bistability across a broad range of parameter space, making the cell fate more robust with respect to perturbations in the feedback loop. this result indicates that cooperativity of ime <dig> molecules is essential for producing bistable sporulation outcomes.

discussion
precise regulation of a gene cascade in a coordinated manner is required for initiating a developmental program at the right time. this is often achieved through the activation of an upstream master regulator, which is controlled by multiple input signals and further regulates expression of downstream genes. downstream genes, in turn, feed back to the regulator to modulate the entire pathway activity. the combinational nature of feedback loops ensures correct temporal dynamics of a developmental program  <cit> .

the goal of this study is to understand and predict the effect of the control structure, i.e., feedback loops, on transient expression of early meiotic proteins and on distinct sporulation efficiencies observed in budding yeast. we construct a meiotic initiation pathway using an ode-based model that includes regulation of ime <dig>  the master regulator, and five other early-meiotic proteins. we consider three feedback loops that control expression of these proteins: double-negative feedback between psok <dig> and ime <dig>  negative feedback from ime <dig> to ime <dig>  and auto-positive feedback of ime <dig>  in particular, ime <dig> is controlled by an upstream inhibitor, sok <dig>  and a downstream inhibitor, ime <dig> 

the model is capable of simulating orderly and transient expression of meiotic proteins, without relying on putative repressors to shut down gene expression  <cit> . the model is further validated by quantitative sporulation phenotypes of single-gene knockouts. we analyze the sensitivity of the model and find that proteins are sensitive to processes that directly regulate their levels. subsequently, we perform in silico experiments on the model to understand the feedback mechanism on controlling transient protein expression and different sporulation efficiencies. the strength of mathematical models is that they serve as easily manipulatable systems for many perturbation experiments that are either extremely difficult or not tractable in a wet-lab setting.

the new insights gained from this study are two fold. first, we conclude that feedback loops play important roles in terminating expression of early meiotic proteins. negative feedback from ime <dig> to ime <dig> is responsible for transient expression of both ime <dig> and ime <dig>  in agreement with previous finding  <cit> . however, our study elucidates, for the first time, that the auto-positive feedback of ime <dig> also ensures that ime <dig> expression is confined to a narrow window. in our model, ime <dig> responds in a graded mode to the ime <dig> levels , consistent with experimental observation that transcription of early meiotic genes is regulated by a gradient effect produced by ime <dig>  <cit> .

more importantly, the second new insight from exploration of the model is that feedback loops are responsible for tuning the efficiency of meiotic pathways. we perform bifurcation analyses on feedback loops using the equilibrium value of ime <dig> as the pathway readout. we find that, by adjusting each of the two arms of mutual inhibition between psok <dig> and ime <dig>  the system is able to move from a default meiotic state to a more efficient meiotic state. similarly, by manipulating the strength of negative feedback loop from ime <dig> to ime <dig>  the model readily produces a default meiotic state and a more efficient meiotic state. auto-positive regulation of ime <dig> is characterized by the hill function with a high coefficient, providing a simple, reasonably accurate approximation for multiple regulations occurring on ime <dig>  this positive feedback generates a bistable pathway with two alternative stable steady states—the default meiotic state and a more efficient meiotic state. the robustness of bistability is sensitive to the hill coefficient, indicating a strong cooperativity and nonlinearity in the response of ime <dig> to the feedback. we propose that the combinational feedback regulation controls sporulation efficiency and guarantees that meiotic initiation proceeds in an accurate temporal scale.

our mathematical model constitutes physical interactions of early meiotic proteins and provides mechanistic insights into ordered appearance of key regulators and sporulation efficiency. such a model illustrates how different feedback regulations are integrated in the signaling pathway to cause changes in protein expression and meiotic outcome. the model is a reduced system of differential equations, including only rim <dig>  ume <dig>  sok <dig>  ime <dig>  and ime <dig>  other proteins and/or links involved in meiotic initiation are traced indirectly. validation using deletion mutants of meiotic genes suggests that major regulatory interactions have been captured. we demonstrate that the ordinary differential equation method can depict the most prominent features of signaling pathway during yeast meiotic initiation. our mathematical model allows for uncovering key regulations that can lead to manipulation of the pathway to enhance sporulation efficiency. this represents an important first step in designing new strategies for producing gametes with high quality and quantity.

CONCLUSIONS
we develop a dynamic model to describe signaling pathways that operate during yeast meiotic initiation. our study suggests that both positive and negative feedback loops control transient expression of early meiotic proteins, and multiple feedback loops regulate the efficiency of meiotic progression. thus, yeast meiotic initiation is the consequence of systems-level feedback that leads cells into distinct sporulation states.
