BACKGROUND
the discovery of micrornas , a class of small endogenous non-coding molecules ranging from 18–24 nt brought a new level of complexity for understanding the mechanisms that constitute various biological processes  <cit> . the involvement of mirnas in the control of gene expression has been thoroughly defined for the cell cycle, metabolism, and immune system and in cancer . binding to the 3′ or 5′ utr region of genes, mirnas may yield increased or decreased gene expression levels and have been described to affect various molecular pathways  <cit> .

approximately half the mirnas are intergenic with few also located in intronic regions  <cit> . these are understood to have their own enhancers and promoters and are transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . however, it remains unclear whether these are produced as by-products of protein-coding gene transcription or whether their biogenesis has its own machinery  <cit> . recent studies in murine and human fibroblasts of liver tissues revealed that mirna expression can either be regulated by their transcriptional genomic location or by other regions in the genome  <cit> . furthermore, mutations in genes involved in mirna processing, such as ago <dig>  dgcr <dig>  and dicer, can cause significant changes in the expression of mirnas, resulting in altered disease susceptibility  <cit> . regarding the skin, in vivo studies show that mirna biogenesis is dependent on both dicer and dgcr <dig>  a lack of these enzymes causes severe phenotypes  <cit> , underscoring the importance of mirnas in the regulation of morphogenesis and homeostasis of the skin  <cit> . differentially expressed mirnas are associated with different physiological and pathological processes in the skin such as melanoma, sézary syndrome, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . advancements have been achieved in understanding various processes regulated by mirnas. on the other hand, the mechanisms that regulate their own expression have so far remained unknown. one possible approach towards understanding their regulation is constraining on genetic loci whose variations statistically link the variable phenotypic effect. we thus performed an in silico expression qtl-based analysis, which has been widely used for deciphering genetic loci regulating gene expression in various biological processes  <cit> . su et al. have further shown that expression qtl-based analysis can provide insights into mirna regulation  <cit> . however, no study has yet been performed to determine the impact of genetic variation on mirnas associated to skin and autoimmune disorders.

this study  uses expression qtl-based analysis to define genetic loci that control mirna expression in the skin and  provides insights into interacting genes to control a single transcript . the relevance of these findings is illustrated by employing a mouse model for the autoimmune blistering disease eba , providing a direct link between mirna expression and disease phenotype. taken together, the data provide insights into the complexity of mirna regulation and possible means to understand various gene interactions altering the expression of mirnas.

RESULTS
a murine heterogeneous inter-cross line was generated by inter-crossing four parental inbred mouse strains: mrl/mpj, nzm2410/j and bxd2/tyj as autoimmunity-prone strains and cast/eij for genetic heterogeneity. as a mouse model for an autoimmune blistering disease,  <dig> mice from generation  <dig> of the intercross-line were immunized with recombinant collagen type vii , an integral component of anchoring fibrils located at the dermal-epidermal junction. this induced a loss of tolerance and production of anti-col <dig> autoantibodies in all immunized mice. the incidence of sub-epidermal blisters and the clinical phenotype of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita  were at 1/ <dig>  <cit> . all mice were genotyped and mirna expression profiling was acquired from skin tissue using the affymetrix’s genechip mirna  <dig>  array. to reveal genetic loci that regulate mirna expression, we then performed an association study between the genotype and the respective expression levels of mirnas. further we performed co-expression analysis between expression levels of mirnas and phenotype. the workflow is presented in a flowchart .

mirna expression is genetically controlled
we performed a genome-wide scan to detect genetic loci associated with mirna expression. expression levels of mirna were treated as quantitative trait to yield expression quantitative trait loci . genome-wide significance was determined by a permutation test. using an e-value cutoff of < <dig> ,  <dig> eqtl for  <dig> mirnas were mapped to the genome, corresponding to  <dig>  % of all murine mirnas present on the above mentioned affymetrix genechip . since the wild derived strain cast/eij was incorporated into the advanced intercross line, we investigated the polymorphic sites located in the transcribed mirnas that may have an effect of probe hybridization which is derived from c57b6/j  <cit> . we obtained the snps and indels in genome of cast/eij from the database  <cit> . we found that 4/ <dig>  mirnas  exhibits indels in cast/eij strain on chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , which may suggest false positive associations for those loci . the highest -log p value of  <dig>  was observed for mir- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> explaining  <dig>  % of the variance. the peak snp  was found within 1 kb of the ube3d gene, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2c binding protein. we found only trans – eqtl, except for mir- <dig> , which was mapped to the same chromosome of its transcriptional site . this indicates that other genes rather than their own transcript may contribute to the regulation of mirna expression which could be tissue specific.table  <dig> eqtl detected for the expression of mirna

prior knowledge suggests classes of gene families that play a major role in the regulation of mirna expression i.e. argonaute proteins and helicases which play a crucial role in its regulation  <cit> . to examine this assumption, we obtained the coordinates of all helicases and other genes involved in pathways of mirna biogenesis from ‘the rna helicase database’ and mapped them to the eqtl identified in our study  <cit> . helicases like ddx <dig>  ddx <dig>  cd <dig> and upf <dig> were mapped within the confidence interval of mir- <dig>  mir-487b and mir- <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  further, four helicases  were mapped within the confidence interval of the eqtl controlling mir- <dig>  genes that are involved in transcriptional processes, such as polr3f, polr2a, polr3g and polr2a were also mapped to the eqtl for mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  other genes which do not belong to these classes, such as lin28a and its homolog lin28b, have been shown to modulate let-7a  <cit> . these genes were mapped to the eqtl for mir- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and mir- <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  suggesting that lin <dig> might modulate the expression of other mirnas as well.

some mirna eqtl were constrained to a specific location in the genome, thereby suggesting potential eqtl hotspots for the regulation of multiple mirnas. on chromosome  <dig>  five mirnas  were mapped between 28–51 mb . three nearby snps  showed significant association  with all five mirnas that were mapped to this region. a long non coding rna 1700019e08rik was located near snp rs <dig> . as for the other two snps, the nearest gene to rs <dig> was mapped  <dig>  kb apart, coding for the snrna u <dig> - <dig>  while the nearest coding gene for snp rs <dig> was a pseudogene gm13489- <dig> .fig.  <dig> eqtl hot spots on chromosome  <dig>  position on x axis represents the coordinates in million base pairs on chromosome  <dig>  the y axis is –log p value. the overlapping peaks on y axis represents an eqtl hot spot between 28–51 mb. mir- <dig>  mir-30b* and mir- <dig> are additional suggestive eqtl with significant genome-wide  threshold after permutation



similarly, on chromosome  <dig> we identified eqtl for three mirnas  in confidence interval 72–95 mb. three genes gm <dig>  siah <dig> and dnaja <dig> were located near peak snps .

furthermore, we found several mirnas that are associated to more than one locus in the genome. for example mir-7a showed significant association with two loci present on chromosome  <dig> . similarly, mir-466-3c was regulated by two nearby loci on chromosome  <dig> . additionally, mir-26a was mapped with two loci on chromosomes  <dig> and x .

epistatic control of mirna expression
a defective of single loci may possibly be compensated by another, or only jointly the effect is the strongest. therefore, for all the mirnas significant single-locus eqtl, we analyzed the epistatic effect for each snp pair. as a result, we identified  <dig> snp pairs for  <dig> mirnas below the significance level  . the highest -log p value of  <dig>  was found between the snp pairs rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  for mir-7a . in total, we found  <dig> snp pairs for mirna mir-7a. the hub locus  for mir-7a was observed on chromosome  <dig> . the same snp  also showed association with mir- <dig> additionally with another snp  present nearby. for mir- <dig> we observed  <dig> snp pairs with snp rs <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> showing the highest number of associations . the same snp i.e. rs <dig> also showed statistical interaction with chromosome  <dig> loci 67–72 mb for mir- <dig>  we also found multiple snps on chromosome  <dig>  statistical interacting with snps on chromosome  <dig> for mir- <dig>  two mirnas  had only one significant snp pair: for mir- <dig> the correspondence was found between snps rs <dig>  and rs <dig> , while mir- <dig> had snp pair rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  .fig.  <dig> epistasis in mirna eqtl. the circular plot shows the chromosomes in their circumference. each connecting line represents a snp pair interaction above the significance level . each interaction is color coded for different mirnas. the boxes adjacent to the chromosomal band show eqtl for mirnas mapped for single locus scans

to search the candidate interacting gene pairs we investigated the epistatic control of mir-501-3p. using the ingenuity pathway analysis , we searched for all the possible interacting genes present between loci present on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . we found three putative interacting gene pairs; namely commd <dig> with cops <dig>  cacnb <dig> with vopip <dig> and commd3-bmi <dig> with rb1cc. interestingly, cops <dig> in the nfkb <dig> pathway possibly be associated with mir- <dig> via tp <dig> .

genetic overlap of qtl for clinical scores and mirna expression
any genetic variation with an effect on the clinical phenotype and mirna levels should map to the same chromosomal region. previously, genetic loci for the clinical phenotype of eba, an autoimmune skin blistering disease, were studied using a larger cohort of mice from the same breeding scheme. previously, we mapped the qtl for the onset of eba to chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . additionally, three qtl were mapped for severity of eba on chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . in this study, we found  <dig> eqtl for mirnas overlapping with the qtl for eba . the eqtl for mir130b , mir-542-3p  and mir-449b  were mapped on qtl for disease onset on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  additionally, we mapped eqtl for mir- <dig>  to the qtl for both disease severity and onset on chromosome  <dig>  to further evaluate, if the variation in the genome is associated with the mirna expression levels and also underlies the clinical phenotype, we investigated the genotype association of significant snps of mirna eqtl with clinical phenotype . we observed that the most significant snp  mapped for the eqtl of mir- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> also shows variation for eba severity score and onset. in this eqtl minor allele  derived from mrl/mpj was associated with higher expression of mir- <dig>  late onset of the disease, and higher clinical score . similar observation was also derived for eqtl mapped  for mir-130b where minor allele  derived for mrl/mpj and nzm/2410j was associated with lower expression of mir-130b, and late onset of disease phenotype .fig.  <dig> overlapping qtl for eba disease and mirna eqtl. the circular plot shows all the eqtl for mirnas  and qtl for eba . it also presents the eqtl hot spots  and eba qtl for onset  and severity . each circular band represents a chromosome on which qtl and eqtl are mapped. the region within the chromosome which has either red or dark red and green or dark green bands is overlapping eqtl with eba qtl

fig.  <dig> boxplot for genotype variations for significant snp in mirna eqtl for disease qtl. the figure describes the genotype variation for the peak snp for mirnas mapped to the previously described eba qtl. a) in mir-130b eqtl, peak snp  have genotype aa for bxd <dig> and cast/eij while bb for nzm/2410j and mrl/mpj strain. the variation associated with three genotypes aa, ab and bb for expression of mir-130b is presented on left and onset week of eba on right box. b) in mir- <dig> eqtl, peak snp  have genotype aa for bxd <dig>  cast/eij and nzm/2410j while bb for mrl/mpj strain. the variation associated with three genotypes aa, ab and bb for expression of mir- <dig> is on left, maximum score of severity of eba disease in middle and onset week of eba on right



expression and co-expression of mirnas
immunization of mice with recombinant col <dig> leads to development of subepidermal blisters and the clinical phenotype of eba in 1/ <dig> of the immunized mice, while 2/ <dig> remain clinically healthy. to access differential expression of mirnas, we divided the 4th generation of our mouse cohort into two separate groups: affected and non-affected mice. comparing the two groups, only two mirnas were differentially expressed: mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  . both mirnas were significantly over expressed in mice with disease. additionally, an eqtl for mir- <dig>  was also mapped on chromosome  <dig>  with its peak at ~104 mb .fig.  <dig> boxplot showing differentially expressed mirnas. the box plot shows the most differentially expressed mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> for the disease phenotype eba. the plots in blue color show the expression of mirnas in mice with no clinical phenotype while mice with signs of inflammation are shown in red



the comparison of diseased and non-diseased mice has its drawbacks; the disease severity observed for individual mice might differ depending on the differences in the genome. to investigate mirna expression affecting disease severity, we performed co-expression analysis among the expression levels of mirnas  in correlation with quantitative scores for severity and onset week of disease. for this purpose, we employed the wgcna r package, which clusters mirnas into different modules and further associates them to a phenotypic score, such as eba severity or disease onset. as a result, we identified  <dig> clusters . using this approach, only the ‘black’ module, consisting of  <dig> mirnas, was significantly associated with eba  . additionally, it was significantly correlating to the onset of eba . due to the fact that the ‘black’ module stronger correlates with the onset of the disease than with the maximum score, one can speculate that mirnas from this module is rather involved in the onset than in the severity of the disease. this would relate to our previous observation, in which mirna eqtl were overlapping with eba onset qtl. the pathways associated with the ‘black’ module were predominantly pathways which have been shown to play a crucial role in other autoimmune disorders, such as the mapk signaling pathway, t-cell receptor and tgf-beta .rfig.  <dig> module-trait relationship between clusters of mirnas with eba severity and onset. the graph is a representation of co-expression analyses of mirnas. the clusters of mirnas are called modules which are color coded on the y-axis. the disease phenotypes  are eba onset and eba severity given on the x-axis. blocks represent the correlation of module with phenotype using a pearson correlation coefficient ranging from − <dig> to  <dig>  the range is color coded with red representing positive correlation and blue representing negative correlation. p values are given in brackets below the correlation coefficients



individual correlation of mirna expression levels with the disease severity identified  <dig> mirnas to be significant  , with mir- <dig> showing the strongest association . to further validate this result we experimentally verified the expression of mir- <dig> in eba skin by qrt-pcr. we found that mir- <dig> is upregulated in eba skin in comparison to normal skin . another mirna which was highly correlating with eba was mir- <dig> . further, investigations of the co-expression module showed that mirnas were potentially co-regulated i.e. possible overlapping genetic loci among co-expressed mirnas. we observed that mirnas in a given locus were either clustered within the same module or showed stronger inter-module membership for a specific module even if they were assigned to different modules. as an example, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  that were mapped on chromosome  <dig> , are clustered in the ‘red’ module. in eqtl hot spots as on chromosome  <dig> , mir-423-3p and mir-23b are clustered in the ‘yellow’ module. even though other mirnas in this locus were assigned to a different module, they also show significance for the ‘yellow’ module. examples are given by mir-671-5p , mir-26a  and mir-291a-3p  . in line with this observation, for the eqtl mapped on chromosome  <dig>  two mirnas  were clustered with the ‘brown’ module while mir- <dig> was assigns to the ‘red’ module but had significant module membership with the brown module as well . thus, these genomic loci may be considered as confirmed and strengthen the genetic contribution for the control of mirnas expression levels.

discussion
small non-coding rnas like mirnas are known to contribute to the onset and severity of various diseases as well as the defense against them  <cit> . thus, mirnas function as tissue-specific key regulators, affecting some of the major pathways towards an aggravation of disease severity when aberrantly expressed  <cit> . accordingly, it is not of surprise that mirnas have been recently recognized as potential therapeutic targets  <cit> .

however, the underlying mechanisms of such dysregulated mirna expression patterns are not well characterized. different studies have shown that gene expression alterations in different tissues are genetically derived  <cit> . thus, it is plausible that not only the regulation of gene expression is genetically controlled, but also the expression of mirnas. in this study we explore the diversity of mirnas in inflamed skin tissue and genetic loci that control variations in mirna expression levels across a mouse cohort. we provide evidence that mirna levels in skin tissue are genetically controlled on transcriptional level by helicases and rna polymerases that are important for the biogenesis of mirna. furthermore, we found that some of the mirna eqtl are restricted to one particular locus in the genome . deeper investigation revealed that these mirnas are under multi-locus and/or epistatic control.

interestingly, eqtl hot spots were predominantly found in genomic regions coding for non-coding rna. hence, it is tempting to speculate mirna expression might not necessarily be solely controlled by protein-coding rna, but rather by non-coding rna which would impose an additional level of post-transcriptional regulation. this in turn leads to the tempting hypothesis that non-coding rnas do at least in part regulate mirna expression. such a scenario is supported by the fact that some non-coding rnas have been shown to bind to mirnas at functional level as demonstrated by an interaction of linc-md <dig> with mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> . here, linc-md <dig> works as a sponge and traps these mirnas preventing the binding to the canonical targets. moreover, a recent study even shows an interaction network between lncrnas and mirnas  <cit> .

based on our observed overlap between qtl controlling mirna expression and eba, a blistering phenotype in autoimmune skin disease, we conclude that there are interconnected pathways to simultaneously regulate both disease development and mirna expression. this might explain the findings of earlier studies that show a clear correlation of aberrant mirna expression and autoimmune diseases . accordingly, initiation and/or progression of the disease do not primarily appear to be caused by aberrant mirna expression. quite the contrary seems to be true; aberrant mirna expression could be a consequence of the disease which in turn would lead to a downward spiral. hence, mirnas could provide a large and unexplored reservoir of potential biomarkers for eba and related cutaneous autoimmune skin blistering diseases and an interesting target for therapeutic intervention.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our study provides a complex framework of gene-gene and mirna-gene-interactions, which eventually leads to disease development and progression. our data provide evidence that mirnas are important drivers of cutaneous autoimmune diseases by acting on various pathways. moreover, the study strongly implies there is yet another, so far largely unexplored level of regulatory network, possibly comprised of by non-coding rnas which on their part affect mirna expression. in this sense, aberrant mirna expression would indeed be one the responsible elements for disease progression, however, the driving force behind might be a different one.
