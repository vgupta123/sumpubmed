BACKGROUND
most proteins interact with other proteins to perform their biological functions in the form of protein complexes. during the past several decades, many docking programs have been developed to predict protein-protein complexes. among them, the docking algorithms based on fast fourier transform  are widely used and have made great success <cit>  because they can search 6d space in a very fast way. these programs include molfit <cit> , 3d-dock <cit> , gramm <cit> , zdock <cit> , dot <cit> , bigger <cit>  and hex <cit> . the base of the original fft-based docking method is shape complementarity between receptor and ligand. it is usually used as the first step of docking procedure and then other methods are used to refine or re-rank the docked structures  <cit> . besides the fft-based algorithms, there are other well-known docking algorithms that also consider flexibility of proteins during docking procedure, like rosettadock <cit> , icm-disc <cit> , autodock <cit> , or haddock <cit> . since the original fft docking algorithm only used shape complementarity feature to solve bound docking problem <cit> , different scoring functions based on other physical features have been integrated into the original fft-based docking method to improve the prediction ability. for examples, the 3d-dock <cit>  added electrostatic energy into the fft-based docking method. zdock <cit>  used atomic contact energy to calculate solvation energy. the hydrophobic docking method  <cit>  combined hydrophobic complementarity with shape complementarity  <cit> . gramm used a long-distance potential <cit>  to calculate atom-atom van der waals energy which has proved effective in detecting binding funnels.

reliable scoring function is crucial to enhance success rate of prediction of protein-protein docking. cheng and co-workers  <cit>  analyzed the performance of different energy components in protein-protein interactions. they showed that the sum of solvation and electrostatic energies contributes more than 70% to the total binding free energy, while van der waals energy only contributes less than 10%. fernandez-recio's work also showed that rather than electrostatic, van der waals and hydrogen-bond energies, solvation energy <cit>  is the most important component in the total binding energy. zhou et al.  <cit>  found that the correlation coefficient between solvation energy and experimental binding energy is  <dig>  with a root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  kcal/mol, and the most important is that the slope is close to  <dig> .

asp  model is one of the best methods to calculate solvation energy. due to its fast and efficient feature, asp model  <cit>  has made great success in free energy calculation <cit> , structure prediction <cit> , and scoring functions <cit> . this suggests that if we integrate asp into the sampling stage of docking algorithms, it may enhance the success rates of docking. up to now, several groups have constructed different asp sets  <cit> . among them, zhou's set <cit>  is the most suitable one for calculating the solvation energy of protein complexes. this asp set was extracted from  <dig> mutation experiments and yielded an accurate prediction of free binding energy of complexes. in this paper, the asp set from zhou's work is used to develop an asp-based protein-protein docking algorithm .

during a prediction procedure, correct auxiliary information  usually can increase the success rate significantly  <cit> , but incorrect auxiliary information may mislead predictors and lead to worse predictions. however, we hardly distinguish whether the information is correct or not before the complex structure is experimentally solved. in this work, we present a softly restricting method of using biological information in which we constrain receptor and ligand partially within the predicted binding sites. using our aspdock algorithm with softly restricting method, we participated in two rounds of critical assessment of prediction of interactions  <cit> . there are  <dig> targets  in rounds  <dig> and  <dig>  we got high-quality hits for t <dig> and t <dig> and the best lrmsd were  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively.

RESULTS
free energy calculation
the asp used here is from zhou and co-workers  <cit> , which contain only six atom types. it proved to be successful in predicting binding free energy of complexes. asp model assumes that the solvation energy of an atom or an atom-group is proportional to its solvent accessible surface area . accurate calculation of asa, which depends on the conformation of proteins or complexes, is a time consuming job. in order to meet the speed of the fft-based docking method, we propose an approximate fft method to calculate the asa and so asp values .

we first test our method on the  <dig> protein complexes <cit> , whose binding free energies have been measured experimentally. for each complex, we perform a bound docking and select the best structure close to the native state. usually the lrmsd between the best structure and native structure is less than  <dig> Å, and so we consider the asp score of the best structure as that of the native structure. using similar method we can calculate the shape complementarity score for each of the  <dig> complexes. obviously, if we set all asp values equal to one, what we calculated in our method is the shape complementarity score.

we compared the asp and shape complementarity scores with the experimental binding free energy for each of the  <dig> complexes. the correlation coefficient between the asp scores and experimental binding energies of the  <dig> complexes is  <dig> , and that between the shape complementarity scores and experimental binding energies is  <dig>  . in zhou's work  <cit> , the correlation coefficient between the asp scores and experimental binding energies of the  <dig> complexes is  <dig>  since they used a more accurate method to calculate the asa than us. this shows that our approximate method can count most part of the binding free energy and is better than pure shape complementarity method. the later is easily understood because the shape complementarity is a reduced asp model by taking all atoms as the same.

benchmark calculation
our algorithm is further tested on the benchmark  <dig>   <cit>  by using both the asp and shape complementarity scores. there are  <dig> protein-protein complexes, which contain  <dig> antibody-antigen complexes,  <dig> enzyme-inhibitor complexes and  <dig> other complexes. in the docking sampling stage, we use  <dig> degree as a step for the rotational scanning. success in top n predictions is defined as that at least one acceptable hit is found in top n predictions. acceptable hits stand for those predicted complexes with ≤ 10Å lrmsd with respect to the native complex structure. lrmsd is the rmsd between the predicted and native ligand molecules after superposing predicted and native receptor molecules. no predicted and experimental information is used in the docking process. result shows that asp method enhances the success rate significantly  in comparison with shape complementarity score.

as in other docking methods, the prediction of enzyme-inhibitor complexes has a higher success rate than antibody-antigen complexes and other complexes. that is mainly because enzyme-inhibitor complexes usually have better interface features than other types of complexes  <cit> . success rate of antibody-antigen complexes is not as high as in some other methods  <cit> . however, complementarity determining regions  of antibodies can be predicted by sequence <cit> . if we utilize this  information, success rate of antibody-antigen complexes should be enhanced dramatically. in general, asp method can enhance the success rate significantly.

we also compared our results with the popular docking algorithms ftdock  <cit>  and zdock  <cit>  using the benchmark  <dig>  . the former can be used to compare the performance of aspdock relative to a pure shape complementarity method and the later can be used to judge the performance of a single asp score relative to the best docking method integrating many important factors of protein interactions. the results show that the asp score indeed gives higher success rate than the pure shape complementarity score of ftdock but lower success rate than zdock. the former shows that "asp complementarity" is more reasonable for describing the interface character of protein-protein interaction than pure shape complementarity. the later is expected because aspdock is only to search a more physical model of pure shape complementarity for protein docking and needs integrating more important factors of protein interactions to get a higher success rate of prediction.

capri rounds 18-19
using our aspdock and softly restricting method, we participated in the capri rounds <dig> and  <dig>  which contain three targets, t <dig> in round  <dig> and t <dig>  t <dig> in round  <dig>  we got one high quality prediction for each of t <dig> and t <dig> , but no correct prediction for t <dig>  during the docking procedure, we searched the structural space in  <dig> steps as follows:  searching the binding site information of receptor and ligand from literature;  scanning the six dimensional space by using aspdock method with the amplified asp valuesρi;  picking out the top  <dig> structures, clustering them and choosing the structures ranking first in each of the top  <dig> clusters. in this step, the structures are ranked directly according to their asp values.  refining the  <dig> structures using rosettadock <cit>  and obtaining a set of new structures;  re-ranking the structures using scoring function, clustering them, and then choosing the structures ranking first in each of the top  <dig> clusters. the scoring functions we used are rossettadock <cit>  and deck. the weight of rossettadock and deck scores is 1: <dig> 

the target t <dig>  is a complex between bovine trypsin  and the double-headed arrowhead protease inhibitor api-a . some important information shared by dr. weng from boston university shows that the two active sites of the inhibitor are leu <dig> and lys <dig> . we incorporated this information into the asp docking of t <dig> by using a softly restricting docking method with the amplification factor α being set as  <dig>  for comparison, we also did a totally free docking without using any information of binding sites by shape complementarity method  and by aspdock method . although free docking can find some structures binding at the residues leu <dig> and lys <dig>  softly restricting asp docking can greatly enhance the sampling around them . there is one high quality and six medium hits in our ten submitted structures. the best lrmsd between our hit and experimental measured structures is  <dig>  Å.

t <dig> is the dnase domain of colicin e <dig>  in complex with the im <dig> immunity protein . the unbound coordinates provided are: e <dig> dnase domain  and im <dig> from the nmr ensemble . we got one high quality hit and eight acceptable hits in our ten submitted structures. the best lrmsd is  <dig>  Å .

t <dig> is a symmetric homodimer and designed based on lynn regan's idealized tpr . residues 1- <dig> and 108- <dig> are disordered. we didn't get any acceptable hits of this target .

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed an easy way to incorporate asp model into fft protein-protein docking method, which can calculate the solvation energy approximately but quickly. this aspdock method is reduced the fft docking method of pure shape complementarity when the asp values of all atoms are set to be  <dig>  the scores of aspdock reflect solvation energy, which has proved to be the most significant energy among all kinds of energies in binding free energy. on the contrast, pure shape complementarity has no clear physical meaning. our results indicate that the aspdock method can enhance the prediction accuracy significantly in comparison with the pure shape complementarity method.

a softly restricting method was also proposed to incorporate the predicted binding sites into the aspdock method. this method is more reasonable than the strictly restricting method, which will definitely miss the correct complex structure when the information is incorrect.
