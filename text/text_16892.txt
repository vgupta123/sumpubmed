BACKGROUND
hydrophobins are small proteins that are unique for mycelial fungi  <cit> . their core structure consists of four beta strands, crosslinked by four disulfide bridges  <cit> , creating a structure enabling the self-assembly at a hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface between the hydrophilic cell wall and a hydrophobic environment . they are classified on the basis of chemical properties  into class i or class ii hydrophobins  <cit> , with class i hydrophobins having been identified in both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, and class ii hydrophobins having so far been only detected in ascomycetes  <cit> . hydrophobins can fulfill a plethora of biological functions ranging from the formation of aerial structures, elicitation of morphogenesis and interaction with potential hosts or symbiotic partners  <cit> .

in the primary sequence, the most important feature common to all hydrophobins is the characteristic pattern of eight cys-residues, which gives rise to a common disulfide network  <cit> . besides these conserved cys-residues and similar hydropathy patterns, however, the hydrophobins share only a few conserved residues  <cit> . the poor amino acid sequence conservation of hydrophobins raises the question as to the evolutionary mechanism driving the rapid differentiation of hydrophobin gene sequences. other genes involved in the response of organisms to their immediate environment have sometimes been shown to be driven by positive selection  <cit> , so called "arms races"  <cit> . however, concerted evolution and birth-and-death evolution under strong purifying selection have also been reported  <cit> .

the fungal genus trichoderma/hypocrea contains a large number of mycoparasitic species  <cit> , and some of them  are also commercially used as biological fungicides  <cit> . interestingly, there are only a few reports describing the occurrence of hydrophobins in mycoparasitic strains of trichoderma/hypocrea  <cit>  and a characterization of the function or biological role for each has not been determined. the class ii hydrophobin genes hfb <dig> and hfb <dig> of the weakly mycoparasitic species h. jecorina  have been studied  <cit>  and shown to serve different functions during vegetative development. viterbo and chet  <cit>  recently showed that a class i hydrophobin from t. asperellum is involved in root colonization. interestingly, this hydrophobin is the only class i hydrophobin identified in any trichoderma/hypocrea sp. so far.

the assignment of a function to individual members of large gene families like the hydrophobins is complicated by the possibility that several of them may have overlapping functions  <cit> , which in turn is dependent on the selective pressures acting on the organism. understanding the evolution of such genes and identifying stable clusters within the phylogeny may therefore help illustrate members with a potentially critical function.

RESULTS
protein structure of the trichoderma class ii hydrophobin proteins
in order to have a representative sample of class ii hfbs from trichoderma/hypocrea, we first screened the available genome sequences of h. jecorina, h. atroviridis and h. virens, retrieving  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes encoding class ii proteins, respectively. second, we searched ncbi and identified one hfb from h. lixii  strain t- <dig> . we also included the hydrophobin-like protein qid <dig> from h. lixii strain cect  <dig>  <cit>  in the analysis. a third hydrophobin – srh <dig> – from "t. harzianum"  <cit>  was also included in this study, but as this strain had been misidentified and is in fact h. atroviridis  <cit>  it turned out to be identical to ha_2a . third, we screened the trichoest database  <cit>  which – besides containing ests of h. atroviridis and h. virens – contains transcript sequences from additional five trichoderma/hypocrea species , resulting in  <dig> further hfbs. the identity of "t. cf. viride"was rechecked on the basis of ests for elongation factor  <dig> alpha  and rna polymerase subunit b  and determined to be closest to t. koningiopsis, and we will therefore name this strain t. cf. koningiopsis throughout this study. our sample consisted of  <dig> class ii hfbs from  <dig> different species of trichoderma, covering sections longibrachiatum, trichoderma and pachybasium , and thus consisting of a well distributed sample.

no accession numbers are given for h. jecorina, because its genome genome is available online; genome and est data were obtained from the following strains: h. jecorina qm6a; h. atroviridis imi 206040; h. virens, gv 29-8; t. asperellum t <dig>  t. longibrachiatum t52; t. aggressivum var. europeae cbs  <dig>  h. lixii cect 2413; t. cf. koningiopsis t78; t. stromaticum cbs  <dig> 

prediction of the encoded protein sequences showed that most of the predicted hfbs had the expected structure of  <dig> –  <dig> amino acids, which includes a 15– <dig> aa signal peptide, the  <dig> aa core structure displaying the eight cysteines which are predicted to have four  <dig> beta-strands and a single helix. however, five of them  and two each from h. atroviridis  and h. virens  contained also an additional n-terminal segment of  <dig> –  <dig> amino acids which was characteristically rich in p, g and n/d, and for which no secondary structure could be predicted with certainty. this extended n-terminus is similar to the one found in the t. harzianum pseudohydrophobin qid <dig>  in which one conserved cysteine residue is replaced by a serine  <cit>  and indicates that it is a general feature of a small group of trichoderma class ii hydrophobins. moreover, within a subgroup of them, a characteristic g xn repeat was found to be conserved .

fig.  <dig> shows the aa-alignment of the trichoderma class ii hydrophobins. most of the conserved residues are located in the four β-strands and around the conserved cysteines. the aa's forming the α-helix, in contrast, showed very little conservation. two of the hfbs, i.e. ta_1c and ta_22a, had part of the helical domain deleted and likely represent pseudogenes. this hypothesis is also supported by our lack of finding transcripts of these two hfbs in a total of  <dig>  ests from different stages of h. atroviridis development . however they otherwise showed the conserved amino acid sequence pattern typical for class ii hfbs, and were therefore retained in the analysis. the alignment led to the identification of  <dig> aa  that were functionally conserved .

genomic organisation of the trichoderma hydrophobin genes
in order to identify the mechanisms acting on the evolution of the trichoderma hydrophobin genes, we first looked at their genomic organisation and exon structures. the six t. reesei hydrophobins are located on five different, large scaffolds, and even the two which are located on the same scaffold  are separated by over  <dig>  bp, and are therefore unlinked. similar, although several of the hfb genes of h. atroviridis and h. virens were located on the same scaffold, they were separated by over  <dig>  bp. in order to analyse whether any of these loci would be syntenic across trichoderma species, we subjected each of the h. jecorina hfb genes plus  <dig> kb of its up- and downstream nt-sequences to a tblast search in the genome sequences of h. virens and h. atroviridis. the loci flanking the six hfb genes in h. jecorina did not flank any of the h. virens and h. atroviridis genes found by this analysis, although the flanking genes alone were sometimes located in the same region on a different scaffold . together, these data suggest that the genome regions containing hydrophobin gene loci have undergone extensive recombination during their evolution.

intron/exon structure of the trichoderma hydrophobin genes
all of the chromosomal hfb genes of h. jecorina, h. virens and h. atroviridis contain two introns, which are very similar although not identical in size, and are positionally conserved. interestingly, the length of the second exon encodes the aa sequence which folds exactly into the single α-helix of the hydrophobin and its third beta-sheet  is absolutely conserved in all genes.

phylogeny of the trichoderma class ii hydrophobin proteins
a phylogeny, based on neighbour joining of the amino acid sequence area from c <dig> to c8+ <dig>  is given in fig.  <dig>  it is conspicuous that the internal branches of the tree are essentially unresolved, and statistically supported clades only occur in terminal branches. bayesian analysis of the same dataset produced essentially consistent results . five strongly supported clades contain hfbs from more than two trichoderma species, i.e. the clades containing h. jecorina hfb1/hfb2; the clade containing tck1; the clade containing tl1; the clade containing h. jecorina hfb3; and the clade containing h. jecorina hfb <dig>  we considered it possible that the poor resolution of the internal tree branches could be due to the lack of conservation in the α-helix, the phylogeny was also performed on an alignment from which the aa's forming the helix had been removed. however, this did not improve clade stability .

evidence for gene duplications within the trichoderma hfb proteins
one feature, which became obvious from the phylogenetic analysis and which is unaffected by the low internal branching support, is the high number of paralogous proteins. examples for this are: ha_1b and ha_1c; ha_6a and ha_2c; hv_21a and hv_22a; tck <dig> and tck2; ha_6b and ha_6c; and hfb <dig> and hfb <dig>  most of these twins form a terminal branch, or are connected by a single node, indicating that they arose by gene duplication. the trichoderma class ii hydrophobins thus display a significant pattern of gene duplications in their evolutionary history.

nucleotide sequence divergence of the hydrophobin genes
in order to obtain an insight in the mechanisms driving the evolution of the trichoderma hfb genes, we investigated their nucleotide sequences. introns were thereby excluded. bayesian analysis, based on an alignment of the nucleotide sequences starting from the triplet encoding the first cysteine  and ending with that of the eighth cysteine , produced a phylogenetic tree which basically showed the same clade structure as the tree based on aa alignment, only with poorer support of some of the interior branches . we investigated the nucleotide phylogeny split decomposition  <cit> , a method depicting the shortest pathway by linking sequences, rather than forcing them into a bifurcating tree. the resulting tree is shown in fig.  <dig>  demonstrating indeed a dense network in the interior branches. the highest probability for a tree like structure was obtained with branch leading to the "hfb4" clade . since such networks may be the consequence of recombination, we applied the phi-test, implemented in splitstree. however, the results of the phi-test favour the rejection of the null hypothesis of recombination . consistent results were obtained by using a sliding window approach in topali . we therefore conclude that the interior network in the tree revealed by the split decomposition method is due to a loss of genes  and not recombination.

the lack of recombination within the hfb genes, together with the observation of gene duplications suggests that the trichoderma hydrophobins undergo purifying selection without concerted evolution. in such a case, the member genes would evolve independently and display a birth-and-death evolution  <cit> . this model of evolution assumes that new genes are created by repeated gene duplication and that some of the duplicate genes are maintained in the genome for a long time whereas others are deleted or become non-functional  <cit> . thus nucleotide sequence differences between genes will primarily occur at synonymous sites, thus resulting in ks >> ka.

we therefore separately tested the total number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, as well as the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site , and the number of synonymous -or silent-substitutions per synonymous -or silent-site   <cit> , both within the total gene exon sequence as well as within the two major exons separately . in total, the number of differences at nonsynonymous sites strongly exceeded those at synonymous sites. however, the number of nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites  was significantly higher than the number of substitutions in nonsynonymous sites  in the complete gene and in exon  <dig>  and slightly higher in exon  <dig>  plotting ks vs. ka for members of selected clades, which had obtained support in the aa-phylogeny  showed that the ks values for some gene-to-gene comparisons are very high  and have apparently reached the saturation level  <cit> . interestingly, different clades showed different maximal ka values, the "hfb4" clade thereby displaying the lowest numbers .

the trichoderma hfb proteins form unique clades within the ascomycetous hydrophobins
the findings of gene duplication and apparently non-functional genes raised the question as whether a similar pattern of paralogous genes would be found also in other ascomycetes, and whether their members would help to stabilize the clades formed by the trichoderma class ii hfbs. to this end, we screened the available genome databases of other ascomycetes by tblast, using members of each of the trichoderma hfb clades as a query . in addition, we searched the ncbi database for previously described class ii hfbs. the result was interesting in so far as most other ascomycetes for which a draft genome sequence is available contain a much smaller number of hydrophobin genes than trichoderma, m. grisea being richest with  <dig> proteins . while we cannot absolutely rule out that some hfb-encoding genes slipped through our analysis because of low similarity to query sequences, this would at the same time imply that they do not belong to any of the clades established for trichoderma, and thus not affect the purpose of this study . the respective  <dig> sequences were aligned with those of trichoderma and used for a phylogenetic analysis. the result, shown in fig.  <dig>  illustrates two points: first, most of the proteins from trichoderma formed their own clades. second, most of hydrophobins from the other  <dig> fungi formed clades which received only poor support, which is best seen by the star phylogeny obtained by bayesian analysis . third, gene duplications were evident for those fungi, for which more than two genes had been found, e.g. m. grisea mgg <dig> and <dig>  and mgg <dig> and 4; for p. fulva pf <dig> and  <dig> 

expression analysis of the "hfb4"-clade hydrophobin genes from h. atroviridis
in order to obtain an estimate of the relative expression of the various trichoderma/hypocrea hydrophobin genes, we first compared the numbers of ests in the trichoest database . the transcripts, which were most abundant, were from hfbs clustering in different clades, indicating that there is no cluster or group which is preferentially strongly expressed. in order to investigate the expression of members of the largest supported clade , we grew h. atroviridis in submerged and surface culture and examined the expression of the ha_1b- and ha_1c-encoding genes by rt_pcr . the results show that both genes are indeed expressed, and thus both duplicated copies are probably still functional, but are found only during growth on solid and not in submerged medium.

discussion
in this paper, we have investigated the evolutionary processes which give rise to the biodiversity of the fungal class ii hydrophobin genes and proteins. this class of hydrophobins has so far been reported to be restricted to ascomycetes only. results from this study, however, suggest that the distribution of these genes may be even more restricted, i.e. the majority of the members of this class was actually found in the sordariomycetes, and only few were found in leotiomycetes and eurotiomycetes. this picture may however be biased by the fact that sordariomycetes are overrepresented sequenced genomes, and the six genes which we retrieved from the two species of dothidiomycetes  suggest that this subphylum may also be rich in class ii hydrophobins. we cannot completely rule out that the low number retrieved for leotio- and eurotiomycetes could be due to a failure to identify these genes by blast search. however, our approach also identified several class i hydrophobin genes from all these fungi , and we would therefore assume that our screening was broad enough to identify all class ii genes. also, our results are in agreement with the results of manual annotation of several fungal genomes . therefore, while it is possible that a potential hfb encoding gene has been overlooked, our data indicate that while most species contained only  <dig> or  <dig> genes , species of trichoderma/hypocrea clearly exceed this with their gene number . the reason for this remains obscure: neither the morphology of the hyphae, the conidia or of the perithecium of hypocrea/trichoderma show microscopic differences which may necessitate new or multiple hydrophobins to support these structures. what differentiates this fungal genus from others, however, is its mycoparasitic and necrotrophic lifestyle  <cit> . while completely speculative at this moment, it is nevertheless possible that a versatile arsenal of class ii hydrophobins may help the fungus to attach to the hyphae of a broad range of asco- and basidiomycetes. an amplified spectrum of genes has also been found for the chitinases of h. jecorina, which undoubtedly also aid to its mycoparasitic abilities  <cit> . with the availability of the hydrophobin gene sequences now in hand for two strongly mycoparasitic species – h. atroviridis and h. virens – this work lays a strong phylogenetic foundation to investigate this possibility by means of respective knock-out strains and expression analysis.

the results from this paper show that the class ii hydrophobin genes of trichoderm/hypocrea contain a high number of duplicated genes, and at least two cases of pseudogenes. this suggests that the class ii hydrophobins evolve by a death-and-birth mechanism  <cit> , a term which has been created for a process in which genes undergo gene duplications, resulting in the maintenance of some of the copies for a considerable period of time whereas other copies are rapidly lost or converted to pseudogenes. our data render the operation of concerted evolution unlikely, because of the high sequence divergence and also by the absence of recombination at the hydrophobin loci. . the fact that most of the duplicated genes occupy terminal branches in phylogenetic trees and that only few obvious pseudogenes were found, indicates that the rate of evolution of the class ii hydrophobins in trichoderma is relatively fast. this rapid evolution, and equally rapid loss of some genes is also reflected in the findings that the clades leading to the hfb genes in trichoderma seldom contain members of other fungi, and their evolution thus took place after formation of the genus trichoderma.

in addition, the numbers of synonymous differences of nucleotide sequences between genes from the same species are very large and frequently close to the saturation level. this high level of synonymous differences further supports the claim of a birth-and-death evolution at the dna level, and supports the long time persistence of these genes in the genome. on the other hand, genes from different species  but belonging to the same phylogenetic clade are highly similar . such a long-term conservation of amino acid sequence is best explained by strong purifying selection. interestingly, and in contrast to rajashekar et al.  <cit> , we found only a few individual cases where the ka/ks ratio was > <dig> and would reveal a history of accelerated evolution. if such a period of accelerated evolution occurred, most of the gene duplicates from this time apparently have not been maintained and the trichoderma/hypocrea hydrophobin genes characterized in this study are therefore mostly of recent origin.

the present study also expands our knowledge on the structure of class ii hydrophobins. while most of them are small, compact proteins, which contain little other structures than the four beta-sheets and the single helix  <cit> , we have detected several proteins which display a long extended n-terminus . with respect to class ii hfbs, such structures have so far only been found in h. jecorina hfb <dig>  <cit> , and in the pseudohydrophobin qid <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, an ent was recently also identified in the class i hfb hum <dig> from ustilago mayidis  <cit> . lora et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that the ent of qid <dig> mediates cell wall binding because it resembles a module which is also present in plant bimolecular proteins  <cit> . interestingly, our work reveals that there are at least two types of these ents: a major one, typified by h. virens hv_21a, h. atroviridis ha_2c, h. lixii qid <dig>  and also in p. fulva hcf <dig>  and in the spacers between the hydrophobin units in the multipartite genes of c. paspali and c. fusii, which are characterized by a conserved repeat of glycine and asparagines; and second type, shown by e.g. h. atroviridis ha_6a, h. virens hv_1d, and h. jecorina hfb <dig>  in which the repeated motif is replaced by several pg/pd repeats, a p-rich stretch or a d-rich stretch, respectively. these proteins did not cluster together, indicating that these proteins do not show a common ancestry of the cysteine-containing core domain. among the proteins with this terminus, one  is intriguing as its ent is very short, which gives rise to the speculation that this extended n-terminus may arise by segment duplication. support for this hypothesis would also come from the multipartite hydrophobins found in claviceps spp.  <cit> , wherein paralogous hydrophobin gene copies are connected by p, g and n-rich loops, and which may have been trapped in the stage of gene duplications at the extended n-terminus before recombining individual copies into new loci. it is thereby intriguing to observe the similarity of the nucleotide sequence of the "gn" repeat  to that found to act as a recombination hot-spot in penicillium chrysogenum . therefore, the occurrence of the claviceps multipartite hydrophobins would be due to multiplication of some of the class ii hydrophobins by tandem duplication  <cit> , for which these sequences could act as recombination targets.

nevertheless, it may still be likely that these ents are not only evolutionary artefacts: the  repeats are reminiscent of s. cerevisiae ure2p, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism, which can become transformed into a prion form by polymerization into filaments  <cit> . these filaments have an amyloid fibril backbone formed by an n-rich sequence which form a parallel superpleated beta-structure. the prion domain is thereby divided into nine seven-residue segments, each with a four-residue strand and a three-residue turn, that zig-zag in a planar serpentine arrangement, the interior of the filament being stabilized by h-bond networks generated by the stacking of n side chains. interestingly, hydrophobins themselves are known to form amyloid-like structures  <cit> , and we consider it therefore possible that the ents form defined structures which additionally contribute to the structural rigidity of the hydrophobins.

during phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence, most hydrophobins from trichoderma/hypocrea did not group into strongly supported clades. however, a few exceptions were noted, notably the clades containing h. jecorina hfb <dig>  hfb <dig> and hfb <dig>  respectively. clade "hfb4" is intriguing as its members – in contrast to hfb <dig> and hfb <dig>  <cit>  were not expressed in submerged culture but only found in surface cultivation. this clade may thus contain hydrophobins relevant for hyphal growth. unfortunately, the differences in aa-sequence with that of the other trichoderma hydrophobins do not provide a clear clue as to the understanding of its function. one notable change is the substitution of the phenylalanine residue in the middle of the single helix, which is otherwise conserved in the class ii hydrophobins from all other fungi , by a leucine, which may give rise to weaker hydrophobic interaction within the protein . however, linder et al.  <cit>  speculated that the aromatic ring of f <dig> is inserted between two pro-residues  from the two β hairpin structures into the protein and may serve to stabilize the fold through hydrogen bonds. interestingly, members of the "hfb  <dig> clade" consistently have p <dig> replaced by an a which may hydrophobically interact with this l. in addition, the first beta-strand contains a conserved motif of two asparagines which provide it with a positive charge. hydropathy plots show that members of the "hfb <dig> clade" have almost no hydrophobicity in the area between aa <dig> and aa <dig>  and their helix is in contrast positively charged. while the consequence of these changes on the structure and function is however unclear our phylogenetic analysis sets the stage for future functional studies that may include transcript and gene deletion analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
summarizing, this study offers a model of evolution which gave rise to the biodiversity of class ii hydrophobins. the more than  <dig> members identified in this study enabled us to delineate the consensus for both essential aa sequence parts as well as for the tolerance to aa modifications to these small compact proteins. our phylogenetic analysis will inform future functional genomic studies aimed at determination of more specific functions for each of the trichoderma/hypocrea class ii hydrophobins. in view of the strong potential of the hydrophobins in "white" biotechnology, this information may offer their further improvement by molecular evolution  <cit> .
