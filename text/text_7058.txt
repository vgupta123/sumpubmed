BACKGROUND
arthropods, such as arachnids, crustaceans and insects, represent the most abundant phylum in the animal kingdom. they are common throughout marine, freshwater, terrestrial, and aerial environments. the success of arthropods can partly be attributed to the protection offered by their characteristic tough exoskeleton. with the advantage of this protective armour, however, comes the problem of growth restriction; arthropods overcome this through periodic moulting, or shedding of the exoskeleton.

the crustacean moult cycle is divided into four discrete stages; pre-moult, ecdysis, post-moult, and intermoult  <cit> , based on the morphology of the exoskeleton. during pre-moult the underlying epidermis separates from the old cuticle , the old cuticle is partially digested and reabsorbed, and new epi- and exo-cuticle are secreted. the old exoskeleton is shed during ecdysis. after ecdysis, during the post-moult stage, expansion of the partially formed new exoskeleton occurs followed by the tanning and mineralisation of the pre-ecdysial layers, and the deposition and hardening of the endocuticle. at the intermoult stage a mature, fully developed exoskeleton is formed  <cit> .

the crustacean intermoult integument consists of four layers. the thin outermost layer, the epicuticle, is characterised by an absence of chitin and is principally composed of proteins, lipids and calcium salts. beneath it lies the exocuticle, composed of chitin as well as proteins and calcium salts. the epi- and exo-cuticle are both secreted prior to ecdysis. the post-ecdysial endocuticle is divided into two layers, the principle layer consisting of proteins, chitin and calcium salts, and the membranous layer that remains un-calcified  <cit> . table  <dig> summarises the features of arthropod integumental layers.

the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects is formed by cells of the hypodermis, an epithelial layer located beneath the cuticle, during both the pre- and post-moult stages  <cit> . at the beginning of pre-moult, the hypodermis secretes a moulting fluid containing enzymes for digestion of the inner layers of the old cuticle. secretion of a crustacean's new exoskeleton by the hypodermal cells begins during pre-moult, before the old exoskeleton is shed  <cit> . formation of the new exoskeleton occurs in layers. the thin epicuticle is formed first, secreted into the extracellular space between the epidermis and old exoskeleton, and a thicker exocuticle layer then appears beneath the new epicuticle during late pre-moult. at pre-moult the developing integument has invaginations over the entire surface of the animal. this increases the surface area of the new exoskeleton within the restricted space of the old exoskeleton. ecdysis enables the expansion of the new exoskeleton  <cit> . immediately after ecdysis, while the new exoskeleton is still soft, unfolding and expanding to a larger size than the old exoskeleton, the crab continues secreting the endocuticle layer beneath the new exocuticle. mineralisation of the new exoskeleton is initiated after moulting  <cit> . the endocuticle layer continues to increase in thickness, while calcification and sclerotization of the new exoskeleton progresses.

the hypodermis synthesizes almost all of the proteins in the cuticle, however, hemocytes and several hemolymph proteins also contribute to the synthesis of the new exoskeleton  <cit> . crustacean cryptocyanin, a member of the hemocyanin gene family, has been implicated in the transport of hormones, phenols, and some cuticular proteins to the hypodermis. cryptocyanin itself may also be used directly as a structural component of the new exoskeleton  <cit> .

the organic matrix of the crustacean cuticle is a complex structure composed mainly of Î±-chitin microfibrils embedded in a protein matrix  <cit> . the protein matrices contain a large number of proteins with different properties. these proteins can be grouped according to the type of domain that they possess. one domain type, the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain , containing the rebers-riddiford  consensus sequence, has chitin binding properties  <cit> . while another, the cuticle_ <dig> domain , is thought to be associated with calcification as it has been found in proteins isolated from the calcified regions of the crustacean cuticle  <cit> .

many genes that are involved in the formation of the new exoskeleton have been isolated both from insects and crustaceans. however, despite extensive research, the molecular events associated with cuticle formation in crustaceans still remain poorly understood. to investigate and gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, we set out to identify genes associated with cuticle formation, and to study their expression patterns throughout the moult cycle of the blue swimmer crab portunus pelagicus. we used microarray technology, which provides a powerful, holistic approach to study gene expression in relation to changing physiological states.

RESULTS
microarray expression analysis
custom p. pelagicus cdna arrays were created using transcripts isolated from both whole crabs, and the brain, eyestalk, mandibular organ  and y-organ of crabs in the following five moult cycle stages: post-moult, intermoult, early pre-moult, late pre-moult, and ecdysis. dual channel cdna microarray hybridisation experiments, using rna isolated from p. pelagicus crabs in the above mentioned stages, were used to identify differentially expressed genes across consecutive stages of the moult cycle. figure  <dig> shows a depiction of the hybridisation experiments comparing each moult cycle stage. many transcripts were identified within the scope of the microarray experiments described, however only those associated directly with cuticle formation will be discussed here.

nomenclature of differentially expressed cuticle protein transcripts
cluster and subsequent blast analysis revealed  <dig> unique, differentially expressed transcripts encoding arthropod cuticle proteins. these were screened in pfam, and were each found to contain one of four different domain types: cuticle_ <dig>  chitin_bind_ <dig>  pfam b  <dig>  and cbm  <dig>  a total of  <dig> unique cdnas, each displaying differential expression profiles relating to moult stage, contain the cuticle_ <dig> domain. four distinct differentially expressed cdnas contain the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain . additionally, four different cdnas contain a domain associated with cuticle protein cpcp <dig> of the rock crab cancer pagurus , tentatively termed the pfam b  <dig> domain. furthermore one transcript containing the cbm  <dig> domain also known as the peritrophin-a domain  was also differentially expressed. the common factor linking these transcripts lies in the domain type they contain, however, they do not appear to be encoded by the same gene nor code for the same protein. three transcripts of an additional type of cuticular protein that displayed sequence homology to a ldla domain containing chitin binding protein from drosophila , termed vermiform, also displayed moult cycle-related differential expression. apart from the cuticle proteins, cryptocyanin, a hemolymph protein known to be involved in cuticle formation, also displayed differential expression across the moult stages. these transcripts have been named according to the type of protein domain identified in the sequence, and numbered consecutively .

the temporal differential expression patterns for genes relating specifically to cuticle formation are summarised in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , listed according to moult stage. the heat map in table  <dig> summarises the differential expression profiles of transcripts related to cuticle formation isolated in this study.

post-moult  vs intermoult 
the transcripts related to cuticle formation that were up-regulated in the post-moult stage when compared against the intermoult stage, are documented in table  <dig>  two transcripts containing the cuticle_ <dig> domain, ppcut <dig> and ppcut <dig>  were up-regulated in the post-moult stage. each consisted of several cdnas grouped together to form a contig. they were up-regulated by an average of  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold respectively. four unique transcripts possessing the pfamb_ <dig> domain  were also up-regulated in the post-moult stage, they displayed a combined average up-regulation of  <dig> -fold, and represent all of the pfamb_ <dig> domain-containing transcripts isolated in this study. two of these transcripts were also up-regulated in intermoult when compared to pre-moult. no differential expression of transcripts containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain was observed in the comparison between the post-moult and intermoult stages of the moult cycle.

the transcripts that display temporal down-regulation in the post-moult stage, when compared with intermoult, are listed in table  <dig>  four different transcripts containing the cuticle_ <dig> binding domain  were down-regulated in the post-moult stage; they display a combined average of  <dig> -fold down-regulation. these transcripts were also up-regulated in intermoult when compared to early pre-moult. furthermore, ppcut <dig> was also down-regulated in late pre-moult when compared to ecdysis. two cryptocyanin transcripts  were highly down-regulated in the post-moult stage when compared to intermoult. both transcripts consist of several cdnas grouped together to form contigs, the combined average down-regulation for cryptocyanin was  <dig> -fold.

intermoult  vs early pre-moult 
the up-regulated transcripts involved in cuticle formation that were observed for the intermoult stage when compared against early pre-moult, are listed in table  <dig>  briefly,  <dig> unique cdnas, all containing the cuticle_ <dig> domain , were up-regulated  in intermoult. this constitutes the highest number of cuticle_ <dig> domain transcripts up-regulated in any of the moult stages. four cdnas containing the chitin_bind_ <dig>  domain, were up-regulated at a combined average of 12-fold in intermoult. this is also the highest number of chitin_bind_ <dig> domain transcripts up-regulated in any moult stage. additionally, two transcripts containing the pfamb_ <dig> domain , were up-regulated in the intermoult stage, the combined average up-regulation for these was 12-fold.

no temporal down-regulation of transcripts involved in cuticle formation was observed in intermoult when compared to the early pre-moult stage.

early pre-moult  vs late pre-moult 
microarray analysis indicates that no statistically significant differential gene expression can be observed between the early pre-moult and late pre-moult stages.

late pre-moult  vs ecdysis 
two distinct cryptocyanin transcripts, each containing several cdnas that aligned to form a contig, were up-regulated in late pre-moult when compared to ecdysis. the average up-regulation of both cryptocyanin transcripts in the late pre-moult stage was  <dig> -fold. table  <dig> displays the level of up-regulation for each transcript.

six cuticle_ <dig> domain-containing transcripts  were down-regulated in late pre-moult when compared to ecdysis . five of these cuticle_ <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in the intermoult stage of the moult cycle when compared to early pre-moult. two transcripts containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain, ppcb <dig> and ppcb <dig>  were also down-regulated in late pre-moult with a combined average down-regulation of  <dig> -fold. both of these chitin_bind_ <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in intermoult when compared to early pre-moult. all of the transcripts that display temporal down-regulation in late pre-moult when compared to ecdysis are listed in table  <dig> 

ecdysis  vs post-moult 
microarray analysis found no statistically significant differential gene expression between ecdysis and the post-moult stage of the moult cycle.

additional transcripts related to cuticle formation
additional transcripts that displayed homology to other previously isolated cuticle proteins, also containing the above mentioned domains, were identified in this study. these transcripts, however, failed the stringent statistical analysis and cannot be defined as differentially expressed. the details and accession numbers for these transcripts are documented in table  <dig> 

these transcripts were not found to be differentially expressed under the stringent analysis conditions applied to the microarray data.

discussion
moulting is an important biological process in arthropods as it is essential for growth, metamorphosis and reproduction. the formation of the new exoskeleton is integral to the moulting process. although many proteins involved in cuticle synthesis and structural integrity have been previously isolated, little is known about the expression profiles of genes related to cuticle formation across the entire moult cycle. the objective of the current study was to use a p. pelagicus cdna microarray developed in our laboratory to identify genes  that are involved in the formation of the crustacean exoskeleton. the microarrays were produced from  <dig> cdnas expressed in both the entire animal and in specific organs such as the brain, eyestalk, mo and y-organ from all moult cycle stages. thus the arrays were designed to study global gene expression profiles of genes relevant to the moulting process, across all moult stages. microarray technology offers the potential to examine the expression patterns of many genes simultaneously, thus gaining a better understanding of gene function, interaction, and regulation.

crustacean cuticles are composed of chitin rods embedded in a protein matrix  <cit> , the physical properties of which depend, among other things, on the sequence of the constituent proteins and the extent of mineralisation  <cit> . many of the proteins associated specifically with the cuticular matrix of crustaceans can be divided into groups, based on the type of domain that they contain. one group contains a cuticle_ <dig> domain ; proteins with this domain have previously been isolated from the hard, calcified cuticle of crustaceans  <cit> . the restricted occurrence of this domain in calcified crustacean cuticle led to the suggestion that it could be involved in the calcification process, either as a nucleation factor for crystal formation or in regulating the growth and size of the calcium carbonate crystals once they have been formed  <cit> . we have isolated and profiled the differential expression of  <dig> unique transcripts containing such a domain across the moult cycle of p. pelagicus. another group contains the rr consensus sequence , demonstrated to be involved in chitin binding  <cit> . proteins with chitin_bind_ <dig> domains have previously been isolated from both calcified and un-calcified crustacean cuticle  <cit> , and also from the cuticles of insects  <cit> . in the present study, four transcripts with the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain were found to be differentially expressed across the p. pelagicus moult cycle. we have also isolated four unique, differentially expressed transcripts containing a domain that as yet remains unannotated, but has previously been isolated from the cuticle of c. pagurus  <cit> , tentatively termed pfamb_ <dig> . it is likely that the different domain types found in cuticle proteins are functionally relevant to the cuticles in which they occur. the expression of cryptocyanin was also found to be moult-cycle related. unlike the other cuticle proteins, cryptocyanin is a hemolymph protein secreted by the hepatopancreas that has also been implicated in the formation of post-ecdysial cuticle  <cit> .

proteins with the cuticle_ <dig> domain have previously been isolated from the calcified cuticle of two decapod crustaceans; eight from the crab cancer pagurus  <cit>  and  <dig> from the lobster homarus americanus  <cit> . all of the proteins previously isolated contain either  <dig> or  <dig> copies of cuticle_ <dig> domains. in our study, transcripts with up to four cuticle_ <dig> domains  were isolated. six transcripts containing the cuticle_ <dig> domain isolated in this study have a deduced signal peptide, and four of these also contain a deduced transmembrane region, suggesting that they are secreted across the membrane . the lack of a signal peptide in the other transcripts may be due to an incomplete cdna sequence, therefore the presence of a signal peptide in all cuticle_ <dig> domain-containing transcripts cannot be ruled out. each cuticle_ <dig> domain consists of two repeated  <dig> amino acid motifs with a spacer sequence typically  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length. the alignment in figure  <dig> has been created from the cuticle_ <dig> domain-containing proteins, isolated from c. pagurus and h. americanus, and from  <dig> unique differentially expressed cuticle_ <dig> domain-containing transcripts  isolated in this study. figure  <dig> depicts the location of the cuticle_ <dig> domain . while the cuticle_ <dig> domain is common to all the sequences, many regions outside of this domain do not share homology. figure  <dig> is a phylogram of the proteins described above for figure  <dig>  a phylogram is a branching diagram  assumed to be an estimate of a phylogeny, branch lengths are proportional to the amount of inferred evolutionary change  <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts the hypothesised branching order of the cuticle_ <dig> domain-containing sequences where the branch lengths are proportional to the amount of inferred evolutionary change. the tree suggests that the cuticle_ <dig> domain-containing proteins do not group according to species, implying that these sequences have evolved to have distinct functional roles that are conserved between species. the sequence variability seen in figure  <dig> together with the apparent functional grouping viewed in the phylogram, points to a functional variation of the proteins despite their shared domain.

of the  <dig> p. pelagicus transcripts containing the cuticle_ <dig> domain, described above, two transcripts, ppcut <dig> and ppcut <dig>  were up-regulated  in the post-moult stage when compared to intermoult. the  <dig> remaining transcripts, ppcut1- <dig>  displayed a combined average up-regulation of  <dig> -fold in the intermoult stage when compared to crabs in pre-moult. four of these transcripts, ppcut7- <dig>  were also down-regulated in post-moult when compared to intermoult by an average of  <dig> -fold. additionally, six transcripts  were down-regulated in pre-moult when compared to crabs at ecdysis. no differentially expressed transcripts were detected between the early and late pre-moult stages or between ecdysis and post-moult. for a graphical representation of these data see table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  from these data we can deduce that the up-regulation of many transcripts containing the cuticle_ <dig> domain begins at ecdysis; expression then differentiates into two groups, those transcripts up-regulated in post-moult compared to intermoult and those down-regulated in post-moult compared to intermoult . this converse expression profile of transcripts with the cuticle_ <dig> domain further suggests that a functional and perhaps regulatory difference exists, even between transcripts containing the same domain. the proteins represented by these cuticle_ <dig> domain-containing transcripts may have different mechanisms or modes of action that facilitate their respective roles in exoskeleton formation. high levels of expression of all cuticle_ <dig> domain transcripts  in the intermoult stage compared to early pre-moult  indicate that formation and/or repair of the exoskeleton continue well into intermoult while expression of these transcripts then decreases dramatically during pre-moult. multiple proteins containing the cuticle_ <dig> domain have previously been identified in crabs. however, until now, the expression patterns of their corresponding genes across the moult cycle have not been traced. although the functional role of these proteins, or specifically the cuticle_ <dig> domain, has not been postulated, the domain is thought to be associated with calcification as it has only been identified in proteins isolated from the calcified cuticle of crustaceans  <cit> . the high level of expression of ppcut <dig> and ppcut <dig> in post-moult , and the up-regulation of the other transcripts containing cuticle_ <dig> domains in the intermoult stage , further support the proposal that proteins with this domain confer moult cycle related changes to the calcified cuticle of crustaceans.

many proteins containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain have been isolated from the cuticle of both insects and crustaceans. in addition to their role in chitin binding  <cit> , several crustacean proteins containing this domain also appear to participate in the calcification of the exoskeleton. calcification associated peptide   <dig> and  <dig>  isolated from the crayfish procambarus clarkii, are multifunctional peptides with anti-calcification, calcium binding and chitin-binding properties  <cit> . crustocalcin from the prawn penaeus japonicus on the other hand, promotes calcification in addition to having calcium binding properties  <cit> . despite the commonality of the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain in these proteins, the promotory role of crustocalcin in the calcification process contrasts with the inhibitory properties described for cap  <dig> and  <dig>  to investigate the levels of homology between proteins containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain, a phylogram  was constructed from the seven  transcripts isolated in this study , cap  <dig> and  <dig>  crustocalcin, and two cuticle proteins isolated from the crab callinectes sapidus, all containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain. the sequences of the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain-containing proteins appear not to group according to species. variable regions to either side of the conserved chitin_bind_ <dig> domain are apparent in figure  <dig> . this points to functional specificity of the sequence outside the domain that is likely to influence the role of the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain in the calcification process. three of the four differentially expressed transcripts containing chitin_bind_ <dig> domains isolated in this study contained a deduced signal peptide, and two of these also contained a deduced transmembrane region , indicating that they are secreted across the membrane.

moult cycle related differential gene expression was observed in four unique transcripts containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain, ppcb1- <dig>  in this study. these transcripts were highly up-regulated  in the intermoult stage when compared against early pre-moult . we found that only two of these transcripts  were up-regulated in ecdysis when compared to pre-moult . the lack of differential expression of transcripts containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain between the post-moult and intermoult stages indicates that both stages display similar expression levels of these genes. the up-regulation of chitin_bind_ <dig> transcripts in the intermoult stage compared to pre-moult suggests that these genes are also expressed in post-moult, and that expression is significantly reduced in pre-moult. the high level of expression in intermoult is perhaps unexpected, certainly in terms of exoskeleton formation, which is traditionally associated with the pre- and post-moult stages. however, this expression pattern reflects the expression of other chitin_bind_ <dig> domain-containing genes, csamp <dig>  and csamp <dig>  of c. sapidus, whereby their expression in arthrodial membranes continued for  <dig> days post-moult before disappearing  <cit> , apparently due to the late deposition of the un-calcified membranous layer within  <dig> to  <dig> days post-moult. the down-regulation of chitin_bind_ <dig> transcripts in the pre-moult stage of the moult cycle when compared with ecdysis, strongly suggest that at least some members of the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain family of proteins are not involved in the synthesis of pre-ecdysial cuticle in crustaceans but rather, are "switched on" at the time of moulting in preparation for the generation of the post-ecdysial, or the hardening of the pre- and post-ecdysial layers. this is consistent with findings for other chitin_bind_ <dig> domain-containing proteins such as cap  <dig> and  <dig>  and crustocalcin, which show that expression of their genes occurs in the epidermal tissue only during the post-moult stage  <cit> .

four transcripts containing the domain pfamb_ <dig>  which as yet remains unannotated, were found to display moult cycle related differential expression profiles in p. pelagicus. the pfamb_ <dig> domain was previously found in a protein isolated from the calcified cuticle of c. pagurus   <cit> , and also in the calcified cuticle protein of c. sapidus . an alignment of their amino acid sequences , and the phylogram in figure  <dig>  indicates that they do not group according to species, suggesting that they represent distinct genes, perhaps clustering according to function. the sequence homology may result from conserved functionality. ppbd <dig> and  <dig> both contain a deduced signal peptide, while only ppbd <dig> contains a deduced transmembrane region , suggesting possible secretion of these proteins across the membrane. ppbd1- <dig> were up-regulated  in the post-moult stage when compared against intermoult , suggesting that they are relevant to cuticle formation or to changes in the physical properties of the exoskeleton observed after ecdysis. two of these transcripts, ppbd <dig> and  <dig>  were also highly up-regulated  in the intermoult stage when compared against crabs in the pre-moult period , signifying their continued expression well into intermoult followed by a decrease in expression during pre-moult. the difference in expression between transcripts containing the pfamb_ <dig> domain in the intermoult stage when compared to pre-moult is suggestive of a divergence in functionality or regulatory mechanisms. to date, little work has been carried out on proteins containing this domain. however, moult cycle related differential expression evident from the present study, and the previously implied specificity of this domain to the calcified cuticle of crustaceans, signal the importance of proteins carrying this domain to exoskeletal formation.

ppcbm, a transcript sharing sequence homology with a peritrophic membrane chitin binding protein from the cabbage lopper trichoplusia ni , was found to be  <dig> -fold up-regulated exclusively in the post-moult stage when compared to intermoult. this transcript contains one chitin binding peritrophin-a domain  and is found in chitin binding proteins, particularly peritrophic matrix proteins of insects  <cit> . in insects, these proteins are important determinants for the structural formation and function of the peritrophic membrane, which lines the gut of arthropods and protects it from digestive enzymes  <cit> . in crustaceans, the mucus layer that coats the undigested products in the stomach and assists in their movement through the digestive tract is also referred to as the peritrophic membrane  <cit> . within crustaceans, sequences with the cbm  <dig> domain have to date only been found in penaeid prawns. the specific up-regulation of the peritrophic membrane chitin binding protein transcript in post-moult, demonstrates its increase in expression during a period associated with cuticle synthesis and hardening. a chitinous portion of the stomach of crabs, and other higher crustaceans, is shed along with the exoskeleton at ecdysis  <cit> , which necessitates the synthesis of a new chitinous matrix in the stomach post-ecdysis. proteins such as those containing the cbm  <dig> domain, which has been demonstrated to bind chitin  <cit> , may be involved in the formation and/or structural integrity of the digestive tract.

moult cycle related differential expression profiles were also observed for three transcripts, ppver <dig>  ppver <dig> and ppver <dig>  which displayed sequence homology to a ldla domain containing chitin binding protein from drosophila , termed vermiform. ppver <dig> was up-regulated in both the post-moult stage compared to intermoult, and during intermoult when compared to early pre-moult. whereas ppver <dig> was down-regulated in late pre-moult when compared to ecdysis, while ppver <dig> was up-regulated in only in the post-moult stage when compared to intermoult. the specific up-regulation of each of these transcripts during various stages of the moult cycle, points to a functional/regulatory difference between these genes, and implicates their involvement in distinct aspects of cuticle formation. vermiform, a gene involved in chitin modification, was found to affect the structural properties of the chitinous matrix of the trachean cuticle of drosophila  <cit> . the authors demonstrated that this gene is not required for chitin synthesis, secretion, or accumulation but rather for its normal morphology and structure. vermiform codes for a protein with a ldl-receptor ligand binding motif and chitin binding and deacetylation domains. chitin deacetylase modulates the physical and chemical properties of chitin by deacetylation, which converts chitin into chitosan  <cit> , and may influence the structure and orientation of chitin fibrils in the arthropod cuticle. luschnig et al  <cit>  demonstrated that vermiform is expressed in epidermal cells of drosophila, and that mutations in this gene affect body shape, presumably by altering the structure and rigidity of the epidermal cuticle. further cuticular abnormalities such as reduced procuticle deposition and aberrant apical membranes were also observed in drosophila vermiform mutants  <cit> . proteins with chitin binding properties are important in the structural modifications occurring in the post-ecdysial cuticle. this is the first report of vermiform like proteins in crustaceans, and their expression patterns indicate that they have a role in the structural modifications occurring in the post-ecdysial cuticle

in contrast to the cuticle proteins discussed above, cryptocyanin was highly up-regulated in the late pre-moult period  when compared to crabs in ecdysis, but was down-regulated in post-moult  when compared to intermoult. this indicates that levels of cryptocyanin transcript decrease at the time of ecdysis and continue to remain low throughout the post-moult period. cryptocyanin expression then increases in intermoult and remains stable during the pre-moult period. these results concur with those of another study in c. magister, in which mrna levels of cryptocyanin were low immediately post-moult and gradually increased to a peak two thirds into the moult cycle then decreased prior to moulting  <cit> . the authors demonstrated that similar patterns were exhibited by cryptocyanin protein levels in the hemolymph, where levels remained low in intermoult, increased in pre-moult and dropped dramatically in post-moult  <cit> . immunohistochemical and mrna expression studies in c. magister, demonstrated that cryptocyanin is synthesised in the hepatopancreas, secreted into the hemolymph, transferred across the epidermis and incorporated into the extracellular matrix of the new exoskeleton  <cit> . the converse expression profiles of cryptocyanin and cuticle protein transcripts across the p. pelagicus moult cycle observed in this study suggest that they are involved in chronologically different stages of cuticle formation. however this temporal delay is likely due to the different sites of synthesis of each protein, as both protein types play a role in post-ecdysial cuticle formation. the time required between cryptocyanin synthesis and secretion from the hepatopancreas, transportation through the hemolymph and final incorporation into the cuticle, may be responsible for the earlier expression of cryptocyanin mrna compared with that observed for the other cuticle proteins in this study.

our study describes the temporal expression patterns of cuticle protein transcripts containing the cuticle_ <dig>  chitin_bind_ <dig>  pfamb_ <dig>  and cbm <dig> domains, as well as the hemolymph protein cryptocyanin, across the moult cycle of p. pelagicus. most of the differentially expressed cuticle protein transcripts identified in this study were up-regulated in the intermoult period when compared to the pre-moult. this suggests that synthesis and/or repair of the cuticle occurs well into the intermoult stage of the moult cycle, and that these transcripts are down-regulated in the pre-moult stage and hence not involved in the synthesis of the pre-ecdysial layers of the exoskeleton. instead these genes may be involved in the synthesis of the post-ecdysial cuticle, or in the exoskeletal hardening process associated with post-moult. none of the cuticle transcripts identified in this study were up-regulated in the pre-moult period, reinforcing the supposition that they are not involved in pre-ecdysial cuticle formation. only the hemolymph protein cryptocyanin, displayed up-regulation in pre-moult, its involvement in cuticle formation however, also occurs post ecdysis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
temporal variation in individual transcript expression, both within those transcripts that contain the same domain and between transcripts containing different cuticle domains, was observed in the present study. wynn and shafer  <cit>  also demonstrated differential temporal and spatial expression between four genes containing the chitin_bind_ <dig> domain in both calcified and un-calcified cuticle, in c. sapidus. this fluctuation in expression levels between cuticle proteins containing the same domain type and the presence of various domains in cuticular proteins indicates that numerous genes are involved in the formation of the crustacean exoskeleton, that they are not up-regulated simultaneously, and that each may have a distinct role in cuticle formation. the moult cycle-related differential expression observed for transcripts containing the same domain type indicates a difference in functionality and perhaps regulation of the corresponding proteins in the crustacean cuticle. we therefore propose that the identification of cuticle proteins be based on the type of domain contained within the protein, rather than the type of cuticle  from which the protein was isolated. as more information becomes available about the role of these domains in the arthropod exoskeleton, the features present within a cuticle protein will become pivotal in describing its function.

tracing the temporal expression patterns of genes involved in cuticle formation assists in elucidating the mechanisms of cuticle synthesis. expression information about such genes aids in their functional annotation, as differential gene action underlies the regulation of differential protein accumulation in the cuticle  <cit> . the expression data presented here provide a chronological depiction of moult cycle related changes to the synthesis of proteins involved in cuticle formation. we have identified a number of candidate genes, by virtue of domain annotation and differential expression data, that could play an important role in the formation and hardening of the crustacean exoskeleton throughout the moult cycle. the expression pattern of these genes, together with conceptual domain annotation, has enabled the discovery of new genes likely to be important to cuticle formation that contain similar motifs to those identified previously. it is evident that cuticle formation and hardening are complex processes involving many components and requiring strict regulatory mechanisms.
