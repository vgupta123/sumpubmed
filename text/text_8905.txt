BACKGROUND
malaria is a disease that kills up to one million people every year  <cit> . immunity against the life-threatening infection caused by plasmodium falciparum develops slowly and only after repeated exposure  <cit> . humoral immunity, besides cell-mediated immunity, is important in protection against the disease  <cit> , and it has been shown that antibodies from immune individuals can reduce parasitemia and clear clinical symptoms  <cit> . some of the antibodies are directed against merozoite antigens of the parasite, like merozoite surface protein  <dig>  and apical membrane antigen  <dig>  . these antigens have both been considered promising vaccine candidates, but so far no vaccine has been shown to be highly efficacious in phase  <dig> trials  <cit> . a better understanding of the presentation and form of antigens in vaccines, and the affinity and function of antibodies to these antigens is essential to advance the development of effective vaccines.

msp <dig> is a 25–30 kda merozoite membrane protein , which has a central variable region flanked by conserved n- and c-terminal regions . msp <dig> appears to play an important role in erythrocyte invasion, and is rapidly processed immediately post-invasion  <cit> . recombinant msp <dig> is an intrinsically disordered protein. however, the parasite antigen appears more ordered, which may be due to interactions with the merozoite membrane or oligomerization of msp <dig>  <cit> . msp <dig> parasite alleles can be categorized into two major groups, 3d <dig> and fc <dig>  <cit> . studies have shown that msp <dig> can induce both naturally-acquired and vaccine-induced antibodies that appear to be protective, and that the response is strain-specific . a phase  <dig> trial of a msp2-containing vaccine demonstrated some protective efficacy  <cit> . antibodies raised against msp <dig> generally do not directly inhibit invasion  <cit>  but have a growth inhibitory effect in antibody-dependent cellular inhibition  assays .fig.  <dig> schematic drawing showing the different mab binding sites on the msp2-fc <dig> and msp2-3d <dig> proteins



ama <dig> is an 82-kda type  <dig> integral membrane protein that is expressed both at the sporozoite- and merozoite stages. native as well as recombinant forms of the antigen have been shown to induce various levels of protection against challenge from plasmodium parasites in simian  <cit>  and rodent models . in humans, presence of naturally-acquired antibodies against ama <dig> has been associated with protection from disease , and monoclonal antibodies have been shown to inhibit invasion of erythrocytes . a recent phase  <dig> trial demonstrated protective effect against malaria due to vaccine-like alleles during the first season after vaccination, but the effect was lost after the second season  <cit> .

measurement of the affinity or 'functional affinity'  <cit>  of an antibody for its antigen has been shown to be a prominent determinant of the biological efficacy of an antibody  <cit> . for pathogens such as bacteria, affinity of antibodies has been proven to be of importance for protection from disease after vaccination . however, there is limited knowledge of antibody affinity to malaria parasite antigens, how this is influenced by protein structure, how it differs between antigens, and how the presentation of an antigen influences affinity. moreover, there are limited data defining optimum methods to measure affinity, and the affinity of antibodies directed against unstructured proteins  in particular. recently, our group showed that naturally-acquired high affinity antibodies to msp2-3d <dig>  measured by spr, were associated with protection against malaria  <cit> .

in this study, we have focussed on conformational changes of the intrinsically disordered msp <dig> protein, and studied how these changes result in different binding affinities of naturally-acquired as well as mab. for comparison, we have also used ama <dig>  which is a protein with a globular fold and a more stable structure. different ways of binding a protein to a surface can result in different conformations of the protein, rendering different epitopes accessible to binding of antibodies; this may be especially important for an intrinsically disordered protein like msp <dig>  we used msp <dig> proteins with the his-tag bound to different ends of the proteins for immobilization, to further evaluate antibody binding. these studies are important for optimal selection of vaccine candidates, and for choosing how they should be presented to the immune system, since high affinity antibodies are probably one of the criteria for creating long-term immunity.

RESULTS
estimation of affinity of human antibodies using dissociation rates 
for estimation of affinity of antibodies in human plasma, we measured dissociation rates, kd, of antibodies in patient plasma. recombinant antigens were bound using amine n- or c-terminal coupling to cm <dig> sensor chips, or his-tagged coupling to nta chips. plasma was flowed over the chips. one lane was used as reference lane . swedish non-immune plasma was used to determine the cut-off to be considered as background level. dissociation rates were independent of plasma concentrations. at least two different plasma concentrations were used to confirm the same values of kd irrespective of concentration. to test the stability of the bound recombinant proteins, a pool of plasma  was used after every  <dig> samples. the kd values were independent of the loss of protein over time . anti-igg was added directly after the plasma samples for a subset of ten samples, to confirm the presence of bound igg to the recombinant proteins .

to avoid loosing antibodies that might exist only in low concentrations, and to include antibodies of all affinities, plasma was used without prior purification of antibodies. we evaluated the procedure using mixtures of plasma containing antibodies with different affinities. ten different png plasma samples were analyzed with msp2-fc <dig> bound through amine n-terminal coupling. individual kd ranged from  <dig> x10−5- <dig> x10−4 s− <dig> . the theoretically calculated mean for these samples was  <dig> x10−4 s− <dig>  but when an equal mixture of all ten samples together was measured, the experimental kd was  <dig> x10−4 s− <dig>  indicating a tendency for the mixtures to show a slightly higher affinity than the calculated theoretical one. this was also the case for a combination of mab; the individual kd for mab 1 f <dig> and 2 f <dig> were  <dig> x10− <dig> and  <dig> x10− <dig> respectively, whereas the experimental kd for a 50:50-mixture was  <dig> x10−4 s− <dig> fig.  <dig> affinity of antibodies  in plasma from individuals living in png. msp2-fc <dig> was bound to the chip through amine n-terminal coupling. ten different plasma samples were analyzed separately as well as in a mixture . the pooled sample shows an inclination towards higher affinity, when compared with the theoretically calculated mean  for the same sample mixture



different affinities of human antibodies for different proteins
when plasma from individuals in png/uganda  were examined using n-terminal amine coupling of antigens, antibodies against ama <dig> had the highest affinity, followed by anti-msp2-3d <dig> and anti-msp2-fc <dig> antibodies . examples of original spr data is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the results were the same whether png or uganda was analyzed separately, or if all were together . the same pattern  was seen for all ages. to establish that the effects of plasma binding to recombinant proteins on the spr chip was due to antibodies, igg was purified from  <dig> of the png samples and tested against msp2-3d7 + msp2-fc <dig>  there were no significant differences in kd between the purified igg samples and the corresponding plasma , indicating that the majority of the effect measured was due to igg antibodies present in plasma.fig.  <dig> comparison of affinity responses  between amine n- and c- terminal coupling. png and ugandan samples  were used together with recombinant msp2-fc <dig>  msp2-3d <dig> and ama <dig>  the box plot values represent the 25th percentile, median, and the 75th percentile. the whisker range determines the 5th and 95th percentiles



the samples from png were from asymptomatic individuals. we compared parasite positive and parasite negative individuals, and found that there were no differences in age or affinity between parasite positive and negative individuals, however the number of samples in the parasite positive group was limited.

affinity of human antibodies using n-or c-terminal amine coupling of antigens to the chip
after observing variable affinity responses for antibodies against msp <dig> and ama <dig> proteins, we investigated whether the coupling chemistry and/or orientation of the proteins affected the kd values. along with using the more common method of n-terminal amine coupling, the recombinant proteins were immobilized onto cm <dig> chips through a c-terminal amine coupling. higher kd values for antibodies from ugandan and png samples were observed when c-terminal amine coupling of msp2-3d <dig> and ama <dig> proteins were used, compared to n-terminal coupling above, whereas the opposite was seen for msp2-fc <dig> . the overall  and individual differences in responses between n- and c- terminal couplings were significant . when the ugandan and png samples were analyzed separately the results showed similar patterns .

for the png samples, there were no differences in the affinities of antibodies to any of the proteins between parasite positive or negative .

affinity of human antibodies using n- or c-terminally his-tagged coupling of antigens
msp2-fc <dig> and msp2-3d <dig> were bound to ni-nta chips through either n- or c-terminal his-tags. five different png samples were used and flowed over the chips in the same way as for the amine coupling . we used four different ways of binding msp2-fc <dig> , and the only significant difference for binding of the five png samples was between amine n- and c-terminal couplings , with lower affinity for n-terminal coupling. for msp2-3d <dig>  the different methods of coupling resulted in highly significant differences in antibody-binding affinities . the five samples were from individuals aged 5– <dig> years, but no obvious trends could be seen with increasing ages . the most striking finding for the different couplings was the low affinity of antibodies to the his-tagged 3d <dig> proteins, whether coupled through their n- or c-terminal his-tag.fig.  <dig> comparison of affinity response  of five png plasma samples. different bindings to the chip for msp2-3d <dig> or msp2-fc <dig>  n-terminal coupling exploits amine groups in the ligand, c-terminal coupling exploits carboxyl groups. hexa his–n terminal protein coupling uses the capture of his-tagged constructs at the n-terminal end of the protein, and hexa his-c-terminal protein coupling uses the capture of his-tagged constructs at the c-terminal end of the protein. the box plot values represent the 25th percentile, median, and the 75th percentile. the whisker range determines the 5th and 95th percentiles



affinity of mab
the effect of different coupling procedures on the kd values of anti-msp <dig> mab was examined, with msp2-fc27/msp23d <dig> bound using n- or c-terminal amine coupling and n- or c-terminal his-tag coupling . examples of original spr data is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  for msp2-fc <dig>  a pattern could be discerned between binding of antibodies to different parts of the protein. 9g <dig> and 4d <dig>  which bind to the conserved c-terminal part of msp <dig>  generally bound with quite high affinities, but with slightly higher affinities to the his-tagged proteins compared to the amine coupled proteins, and in both cases with similar affinities between n- and c-terminal bindings. 6c <dig>  1 f <dig> and 9h <dig> also bind to the conserved c-terminal part of msp <dig>  but binding is dependent on an intact disulphide bond, and we could see higher affinities when binding to the n-terminally coupled proteins. 6d <dig> and 8g <dig>  which bind towards the n-terminal end of msp <dig>  showed similar, high affinities when using his-tagged coupling but slightly higher affinities when using amine n-terminal coupling compared to amine c-terminal coupling.fig.  <dig> affinity responses measured as kd values of the mab against msp <dig> using different couplings. the msp <dig> proteins  msp2-fc <dig>  msp2-3d <dig> were coupled in four different ways to the chip; either through amine or his-tagged n-terminal or c-terminal coupling. the location of mab binding to msp <dig> is shown in fig. 1




for msp2-3d <dig>  the pattern between different binding sites of the antibodies was less clear. 9g <dig> and 4d <dig>  bound with lower affinity to the n-terminally amine coupled protein compared to the rest of the proteins. 1 f <dig> and 9h <dig>  bound with very high affinity to the n-terminally amine coupled protein, but with lower affinity to the rest of the proteins. 6c <dig>  which is supposed to bind in a similar way as 1 f <dig> and 9h <dig>  was found to bind with lower affinity for the n-terminally amine coupled protein compared to 1 f <dig> and 9h <dig>  the mab 6d <dig>  which recognizes a conserved n-terminal epitope, bound with high affinity whatever way the msp2-3d <dig> protein was coupled to the chip. in general, the antibodies that recognized the variable region of msp2-3d <dig>  bound with the highest affinity to the protein when using the amine c-terminal coupling.

there was no cross reactivity observed between allele-specific mab .

as a comparison to the above msp <dig> proteins, we also tested the monoclonal antibody 1 f <dig>  which bound very strongly to ama <dig> . the kd results were in the 10− <dig> range, but as the off-rate was almost like a straight line due to the very strong binding, it was difficult to estimate a true kd value .

levels of antibodies using elisa and correlations with spr
all individuals had antibodies in elisa to the three recombinant antigens studied, but there was no association with age . for png samples there was no difference in antibody levels between parasite positive and negative individuals.

when the antibody levels in elisa were compared to spr, correlations were seen for the ugandan samples  mainly for ama <dig> .

for the png samples, there were correlations for ama <dig> both when parasite positive and negative samples were included for n-terminal coupling . for elisa-c-terminal amine coupling r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  for all samples, r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  only parasite positive and non-significant r2 =  <dig>  only parasite negative.fig.  <dig> correlation for png samples between elisa and spr results for amine n-terminal coupling of ama <dig>  parasite positive samples indicated with squares, r2 =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; parasite negative samples indicated with triangles, r2 =  <dig>  p <  <dig> ; all samples included r2 =  <dig>  p <  <dig> )



weaker correlations were seen in the png samples between elisa-spr for msp2; msp2-3d <dig> elisa-n-terminal amine coupling r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  all samples, r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  only parasite positive. elisa-c-terminal coupling r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  all samples, r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  only parasite positive. when msp2-fc <dig> was used in n-terminal amine coupling, the only correlation with elisa was for parasite positive .

in conclusion, the analysis showed better correlations between elisa and spr results for ama <dig> compared to the msp <dig> proteins, and better correlations when only parasite positive samples were included in the analysis.

invasion inhibition and correlations with elisa and spr
for the ugandan samples, invasion inhibitory experiments were performed using two clinical isolates . we could see correlations between invasion inhibition and spr results for uam <dig> and amine n-terminal spr results for msp2-3d <dig> , and for both clinical isolates and amine c-terminal spr for ama <dig> . for non-significant correlations, r <dig> were < <dig> . invasion inhibition results were also compared to elisa, and significant correlations were seen for uas <dig> versus ama <dig> , uas31-msp2-fc <dig> r2 =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , and for uam <dig> versus ama <dig> . for the non-significant correlations, r <dig> values ranges were < <dig> .

discussion
for most merozoite surface proteins, the conformation of the native protein located on the surface of the merozoite is not known. a number of proteins, including ama <dig>  have globular domains stabilized by intramolecular disulphide bonds  <cit> . such structures will be relatively stable but protein-protein interactions can result in significant changes in conformation as has been described for ama <dig> when it interacts with ron <dig>  <cit> . for msp <dig>  an intrinsically disordered protein, protein-protein interactions, or interactions with the membrane itself, might have major effects on the conformation of the protein and thereby affect the interaction between msp <dig> and antibodies. both ama <dig> and msp <dig> are known targets of naturally-acquired protective immune responses, as a majority of adults living in malaria endemic regions have high levels of antibodies as measured by elisa  <cit> . however, in vaccine studies, it is important to choose proteins that can generate functionally important antibodies. an antibody that is going to function in vivo probably needs to be of high affinity, including a low off-rate, so that once an antibody is bound to the merozoite surface, it can stay there during the invasion process. it has been shown before that it is of importance with both antibody titer and affinity of the antibodies  <cit> . we tested the monoclonal antibody 1 f <dig>  directed against ama <dig>  and found an extremely kd value, indicating a very strong binding. this is in line with earlier studies of 1 f <dig>  which have shown that 1 f <dig> and ama <dig> interacts with a very large interface, creating an environment suitable for a stable structure  <cit> . in future studies, it would be of interest to include other merozoite proteins, such as msp <dig>  which is also a vaccine candidate, for testing in spr to investigate whether this protein can also induce high affinity antibodies. the part of msp <dig> that is inserted into the erythrocyte consists of two epidermal growth factor-like domains, which  are very stable in their structure due to several disulphide bonds.

our findings demonstrate that there are major differences in antibody affinity  for two leading merozoite vaccine candidates, which may reflect structural differences. we show that the form in which antigens are immobilized significantly influences antibody affinity, which is relevant for understanding how to present antigens in vaccines, and how to measure antibody affinity in vaccine trials and studies of naturally-acquired immunity. antibody affinity also generally increased with increasing antibody levels, consistent with increasing malaria exposure leading ultimately to protective immunity, including both higher affinity of antibodies as well as higher levels of antibodies. it should be noted that kd values are independent of concentration, which is convenient in this case. in general, measuring antibodies by elisa cannot be relied on as a good correlate of antibody affinity. it has been shown before when using guanidine thiocyanate, that high levels of antibodies against msp <dig> is not necessarily related to avidity of the antibodies  <cit> . duration of antibodies is also important, msp <dig> antibodies have been shown to be of shorter half-life than antibodies against ama <dig>  <cit> . in this case it was probably not because of different antibody subclasses, but in other cases this might be a more important reason for differences in half-lives of antibodies as has been shown for eba <dig>  <cit> .

in our studies, we measured kd values of naturally-acquired, human antibodies. we believe that our method is more physiological and more precise than many other methods since we include all antibodies  in our measurements and the net effect is measured. spr is also a method where the measurements are performed under flow, which is the natural situation in vivo. using this method, we could see higher affinity of naturally-acquired antibodies to ama <dig> compared to msp <dig>  and higher affinity for the 3d <dig> allele of msp <dig> compared to fc <dig>  this pattern was consistent whether measured in samples from uganda or png, and for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. the higher affinity for ama <dig> could be due to a more stable structure of the protein, making it easier for antibodies to stay bound to their target, compared to msp <dig> that has a more flexible structure. for msp <dig>  strain-specificity has been noted before to be of importance for formation of a protective response  <cit> . it might be that the 3d <dig> allele has been more common in the studied populations over the years than fc27; 3d <dig> is generally more prevalent globally, and is more prevalent in the png study population <dig>  suggesting that greater exposure may partly explain the greater affinity of antibodies to msp2-3d <dig>  also in the ugandan population, msp2-3d <dig> has been shown to be more common with 96 % of patients with uncomplicated malaria being positive, and 74 % being positive for msp2-fc <dig>  <cit> . however, there could also be intrinsic differences in the tendency to form a stable structure between the allelic forms of the proteins. both forms have central repeat regions that are probably important for formation of antibodies, since many of the antibodies seems to be directed against this part, and not so much against the n- or c- terminal conserved parts . however, this central region is different for the two proteins and when we coupled the proteins to the spr-chips, it was quite clear that there were differences in affinity depending on the way the proteins were bound. for 3d <dig>  the affinity of naturally-acquired antibodies was higher when the protein was bound through its n-terminal part, while for fc <dig> the affinity was higher when bound through its c-terminal part. these results could be explained by antibodies being directed against epitopes that are central, but still more close to the c-terminal region for msp2-3d <dig>  and more close to the n-terminal region in msp2-fc <dig> .

when the results from spr were compared to antibody levels measured by elisa, there were correlations both with results from amine n-terminal and c-terminal coupling, indicating that epitopes at both ends of the protein are available in elisa. correlations were often weak, emphasizing that spr and elisa are two different methods that measure different things, and correlations might therefore not be consistently present. we also compared spr results to invasion inhibition assays, and saw very modest correlations. when elisa was compared to invasion inhibition results, there were stronger correlations between levels of ama <dig> and invasion inhibition compared to levels of msp <dig>  supporting earlier results that have suggested ama <dig> antibodies to be directly inhibitory, while msp <dig> antibodies might need adci to be inhibitory.

for most of the msp <dig> mab, there were clear differences in affinity of bound antibodies depending on which coupling method was used for the proteins. we can’t be sure that what we call “n”-and “c”-terminal coupling is really using those ends of the proteins, but at least we know that it is totally different ways of binding the proteins. the proteins probably form different structures when bound differently, since we know that the mab are homogenous. it has been shown before that alterations in kd values can be caused by conformational changes in immobilized proteins when spr has been applied . because this kind of difference was seen both for mab and for naturally acquired human polyclonal antibodies, we think it is not just an effect of including different antibodies in the polyclonal response, but that antibodies will bind with different affinities depending on how the protein is presented to the antibody. this is important knowledge, since an efficient vaccine should probably be one that induces high affinity antibodies and one has to consider in what way the proteins are presented to the immune system.

for a small number of samples we tried coupling of the msp <dig> proteins through their his-tag. binding of naturally acquired antibodies to msp2-3d <dig> gave lower affinity when bound through the his-tag, whether the his-tag was at the n- or c-terminal end . this might be because the protein itself became more flexible in structure when bound through the his-tag compared to binding with amine coupling, making it more difficult for antibodies to bind. it has been shown before that different environments can affect the structure of msp <dig>  and it has even been suggested that the n-terminal part of msp <dig> can be stabilized by lipid interactions  <cit> . when mab were used, the antibodies directed against the conserved c-terminal part of msp <dig> also showed a lower affinity towards the his-tag coupled proteins. since this pattern was only seen when mab against the conserved c-terminal part of the protein were used, one can speculate that many of the antibodies in plasma were also directed against this part, at least for msp2-3d <dig>  these results point out the potential importance of the exact placement of added tags for creating a more stable structure in proteins, especially when using intrinsically disordered proteins, in forming binding sites for functionally important antibodies. in most spr studies, n-terminal coupling of proteins is used, since this is the easiest to perform. c-terminal coupling includes an extra step of serial dilutions of pdea, and when his-tags are used to bind proteins to the chips, every regeneration induces total loss of the bound protein from the chips, which makes the experiments much more cumbersome to perform. however, one should be aware of possible differences in results that can be induced through different forms of binding of proteins, when using spr. the structure of msp <dig> in the merozoite is not known, and part of the reason for that is probably that it is an unstructured protein, which makes it more challenging to study compared to a protein with a more stable structure, but placing his-tags at different ends might help in facilitating for some specific antibodies to bind. however, further studies are needed to clarify the exact structure of msp <dig> on the surface of the merozoite, and when this is known it should be easier to decide which antibodies are best in protecting patients from malaria.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have measured affinity of both monoclonal and naturally-acquired antibodies in human plasma, and we showed that the measurement of affinity was dependent on how the proteins were bound to surfaces and presented, and in which way the tag was bound to the protein. this information is crucial for vaccine studies, where the goal is to have the best possible conformation of a protein and expose important epitopes to create antibodies that are of high affinity and that can be functional over a long period of time.
