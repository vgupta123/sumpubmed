BACKGROUND
polyamidoamine  dendrimers can serve as biocompatible polymeric nanocarriers of bioactive molecules of interest. they are versatile in that their size, shape and placement of functional groups can be customized for various applications  <cit> . for example, dendrimers have been studied for targeted drug and gene delivery  <cit>  or for use as experimental tools to carry markers to targeted cells that express unique receptors  <cit> . additionally, the attachment of drugs to dendrimers can prevent their premature degradation or even enhance tissue selectivity  <cit> . nucleoside derivatives that activate adenosine receptors  can also be attached to dendrimers, which can greatly improve potency or effectiveness of the nucleoside ligands  <cit> .

in the present study, an agonist of the a3ar conjugated to a pamam dendrimer was characterized pharmacologically and tested for protective effects in an isolated mouse heart model of ischemia/reperfusion  injury. the a3ar is one of four subtypes among a g protein-coupled receptor  family  that responds to extracellular adenosine  <cit> . adenosine levels are significantly increased during ischemic stress, thereby activating ars near the site of injury  <cit> . of the four subtypes, a <dig> and a3ars present in the heart are well known to mediate the cardioprotective effects of adenosine  <cit> . however, unlike the a1ar, when the a3ar is activated by selective agonists, such as cl-ib-meca  <dig> , it does not induce detrimental hemodynamic side effects, such as negative chronotropy, inotropy and dromotropy  <cit> .

there is a medicinal chemical challenge in designing nucleosides that act as selective a3ar agonists across species. we have reported a class of a3ar agonists that are 5'-n-methyl-carboxamido adenosine analogues containing a methanocarba  ring system in place of ribose to maintain a preferred north  conformation, but some of the analogues such as mrs <dig>  <dig> were shown to display > <dig> -fold selectivity for the human  a3ar but not the mouse  and rat a3ars  <cit> . this is because the -methanocarba ring system is better tolerated at the a1ar in rodents than in humans, thereby, reducing selectivity for rodent a3ars  <cit> . thus, these agonists that are otherwise very selective in human are of limited use in rodent models. however, by varying substituents on the n <dig> and c <dig> positions in the same structural series, species independent a3ar selectivity was restored, especially in analogues containing a 2-alkynyl  group  <cit> . in the present study, we have applied the principle of enhancement of ma3ar selectivity of 2-alkynyl analogues to chain extended structures. specifically, the dialkyne  <dig> contains a second alkynyl group at the terminal position for conjugation by click chemistry -catalyzed  <dig> -dipolar cycloaddition reaction) to an azido derivatized pamam dendrimer 4b to produce a gpcr-ligand dendrimer  conjugate. the click precursor  <dig> also served as an intermediate for the model compound  <dig>  both  <dig> and the corresponding multivalent glide conjugate mrs <dig>  <dig> were pharmacologically characterized at mouse ars, and it was determined whether binding and functionality were affected by conjugation. then, the cardioprotective effects of these monomeric and polymeric a3ar agonists were evaluated utilizing isolated mouse hearts in a langendorff-perfusion system.

RESULTS
agonist structures and competition binding
we characterized the mar binding of a glide conjugate, mrs <dig>  and an unconjugated, structurally related monomer agonist, mrs <dig>  <dig>  the glide conjugate mrs <dig> was synthesized, as reported  <cit> , by covalently conjugating a precursor monomer, mrs <dig>  <dig>  onto a fourth generation  fully-substituted azido pamam dendrimer precursor 4b . the monomeric compound, mrs <dig>  <dig>  mimicked the structure of the modification of mrs <dig>  <dig> after conjugation to the dendrimer. thus, the cu-catalyzed click reaction forms a triazole from the combination of an azido group  and a terminal alkyne .

from competition radioligand binding assays, it was determined that the glide conjugate, mrs <dig>  and the monomer, mrs <dig>  both bind with significantly higher affinity to the ma3ar than to the ma1ar by 359- and 169-fold, respectively . when comparing the selectivity of these agonists at the ma3ar, the glide conjugate mrs <dig> showed a  <dig> -fold higher affinity than the monomer mrs <dig> .

camp functional assays
camp assays in hek <dig> cells overexpressing recombinant mars were utilized to determine the potency, expressed as ic <dig>  of mrs <dig> and mrs <dig>  both mrs <dig> and mrs <dig> were full agonists and highly selective for the ma3ar in comparison to the ma1ar . in fact, mrs <dig> at  <dig> μm was inactive at the ma1ar. when the conjugate mrs <dig> was compared to the monomer mrs <dig> in activating the a3ar, the conjugate was 200-fold more potent  .

isolated mouse heart i/r experiments
mrs <dig> and mrs <dig> were tested for effects on functional improvement in isolated mouse hearts subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion. the agonists were infused into the coronary circulation of the hearts for  <dig> min immediately before  <dig> min of global ischemia. the functional recovery parameters  of the hearts were assessed throughout reperfusion and after  <dig> min of reperfusion and compared to those of control hearts.

first, it was confirmed that the nearly fully azide-derivatized pamam dendrimer precursor not bearing any nucleoside moieties, mrs <dig> 4a , did not invoke any functional effects. there was no improvement of functional recovery following i/r after the hearts were exposed to ≤ <dig> nm mrs <dig> . however, the monomeric agonist, mrs <dig>  and glide conjugate, mrs <dig>  evoked improved functional recovery compared to control in a concentration-dependent manner . mrs <dig> provided marginally better improvement compared to mrs <dig> at both  <dig> and  <dig> nm. mrs <dig> at the lower concentration of  <dig> nm produced a statistically significant improvement in the recovery of lvdp throughout reperfusion whereas an equivalent concentration of mrs <dig> did not. thus, mrs <dig> exhibited greater potency at providing ischemic protection.  <dig> nm mrs <dig> was also infused into hearts from a3ko mice and subjected to i/r. there was no effect on functional improvement in these hearts compared to control hearts .

discussion
pamam dendrimers are biocompatible polymers with extensive and advantageous applications in drug delivery in vivo. previous data have shown glide conjugates and other nanoconjugates to acquire beneficial pharmacological characteristics, such as increased receptor affinities, increased potency and/or increased selectivity in comparison to monomeric ligands  <cit> . these nanocarriers may also provide pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages, such as impeded metabolic degradation or tissue selectivity  <cit> . in our case, the drug is not intended for cleavage from the carrier at the site of action. the extracellular intact conjugate holds the relevant biological activity and can benefit from the versatility of the pamam dendrimers for further derivatization or structural modification as needed for the biological application.

for the present studies, an adenosine analogue  selective for the ha3ar, but modified to possess improved selectivity for the a3ar in mouse, was characterized in mouse model experiments  <cit> . this compound was also investigated as a ma3ar agonist pharmacophore for conjugation to a g <dig> pamam dendrimer for the synthesis of the glide conjugate, mrs <dig> 

it was determined that both agonists, mrs <dig> and mrs <dig>  bind with high affinity to the ma3ar with ki values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively. in comparison to other ar subtypes, they are highly selective for the ma3ar. this includes high selectivity over the a1ar, the subtype to which these analogues might be more likely to bind compared to a2a or a2bars. it was further determined that mrs <dig> and mrs <dig> are highly potent in in vitro functional assays to inhibit camp production via a3ar-induced activation of gi proteins compared to that of the a1ar. mrs <dig> showed an ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm at the ma3ar compared to  <dig>  nm at the ma1ar , while mrs <dig> resulted in an ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm at the ma3ar and lacked inhibition at the a1ar up to  <dig>  mm. therefore, these compounds promised to be excellent candidates for the study of cardioprotection by a3ar activation in mouse models.

in comparing the activities of the two compounds, mrs <dig> possessed a much higher affinity to the ma3ar compared to the monomer, mrs <dig>  by  <dig> -fold. the conjugated mrs <dig> was also 200-fold more potent a3ar agonist than the monomer, mrs <dig>  in an in vitro camp assay. these findings are comparable to previous findings with other glide conjugates, which significantly improved affinity and potency over the unconjugated monomeric agonists  <cit> . the ki values of these agonists in binding to hars have been reported and indicate that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are all a3ar-selective  <cit> . for example, the triazole derivative  <dig> displayed ki values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig> ±  <dig> nm at the ha3ar and ha2aar, respectively, and at  <dig> μm inhibited only  <dig> ± 4% of the radioligand binding at the ha1ar  <cit> . thus, the model compound  <dig> binds to the ma3ar with  <dig> -fold greater affinity than to the ha3ar. the conjugate  <dig> binds to the ma3ar with  <dig> -fold greater affinity than to the ha3ar. in comparison to the a1ar, the a3ar selectivity of  <dig> is slightly greater in the mouse  than human .

the binding and in vitro camp assays were performed under unrestricted solution conditions, with no intervening biological barriers such as would be encountered in vivo. there is limited hindrance in these experiments for the pamam dendrimers, which range in size of around ~ <dig> Å in diameter for a g <dig> dendrimer  <cit> . this size estimate does not include the addition of the covalently conjugated agonist moieties, which would further increase the diameter. however, in vivo, the glide conjugates must reach the myocardial targets by extravasation from the coronary microvasculature. it has been determined that the extravasation process of pamams alone is dependent on the size and maybe even charge of the compounds  <cit> . these authors found that with each size-increasing generation of pamam dendrimers, up to the g <dig>  there was a weight- and size-dependent decrease in the extravasation of the dendrimers. there was a steady decrease in the rate of extravasation from the g <dig> to g <dig> dendrimers, but an especially high decrease between g <dig> and g <dig>  <cit> .

however, in light of these intuitive results that greater sizes offer hindrances, the langendorff isolated heart experiments showed that the glide conjugate, mrs <dig>  was just as, maybe even more, effective than the monomeric agonist in generating cardioprotection after i/r. mrs <dig> and mrs <dig> were effective in a concentration-dependent manner, where both showed significant protection starting at one nanomolar, and the effects were greater at  <dig> nm. the percentage of improvements after  <dig> min of reperfusion was marginally greater for the glide conjugate at these concentrations. however, the multivalent conjugate mrs <dig>  was more effective than the monomer mrs <dig> in improving lvdp over control when observing the hearts throughout reperfusion. since we did not obtain a direct measure of cell death, it should be noted that we do not know whether the improvements in functional recovery with agonist treatment observed in the isolated mouse heart studies resulted from protection against reversible injury  and/or necrotic cell injury .

CONCLUSIONS
conjugation of an a3ar-specific agonist to a pamam dendrimer indeed greatly improved its in vitro affinity and potency compared to the monomer itself. however, despite the greatly increased size and bulkiness of the glide conjugate, it retained its potent cardioprotective effects in mouse isolated perfused hearts, and it was more effective than its smaller monomeric counterpart. this implied that the barrier for extravasation from the coronary microvasculature did not prevent passage of at least some of the polymeric conjugate.

these findings provide assurance that glide conjugates warrant further study in vivo of their very important advantages over the unconjugated ligands. because ars are expressed throughout the body and produce different effects, these specific ma3ar dendrimers can be utilized to investigate methods to specifically target them to the myocardium, perhaps on the basis of an antibody complex. it has been determined that there is enhanced stability of ligands when they are conjugated to pamam dendrimers  <cit> . protection of a3ar agonists against early degradation in the form of glide conjugates is essential, especially considering the findings that a3ar agonists may be cardioprotective, but some are very short-lived. it is also becoming evident that gpcrs, including ars, may function more efficiently as homo- or heterodimers  <cit> . these dendrimers, which provide ways to control the dimensions or spacing between the functional groups, will be important for studying ars as oligomers. additionally, other gpcr-binding ligands, such as opioids, also provide cardioprotection, in addition to findings that adenosine and opioid receptors can dimerize  <cit> . these dendrimeric carriers can be utilized to carry multiple agents to targeted tissues as enhanced cardioprotectants.
