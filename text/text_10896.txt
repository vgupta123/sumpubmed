BACKGROUND
species differences in cortical regionalization reflect genetic and epigenetic developmental programs that are presumed adaptations to different ecological niches. for example, krubitzer and kahn  <cit>  review that the mouse, ghost bat, and short-tailed opossum have approximately the same size cortical sheet, but differ substantially in the size of one of three primary sensory cortical areas. the enlarged cortical area in each species reflects a greater behavioral reliance on the represented sensory modality. in the same sensory modality, functional specialization of the sensory periphery is also reflected in the primary cortical area size. catania and remple  <cit>  show that the naked mole-rat, a fossorial species dependent on somatosensation, has a much greater cortical surface area devoted to somatosensation compared to the laboratory rat. as discussed by krubitzer and kahn  <cit> , although differences in genetic determination are well implicated by these species differences, identity of the genes and their developmental actions are not well understood.

recent experimental manipulations in mice have caused striking qualitative and quantitative changes in the cortical area map, identifying several candidate morphogens that affect anteroposterior or mediolateral cortical regionalization as well as mitogenesis  <cit> . for example, fukuchi-shimogori and grove  <cit>  placed an ectopic caudal source of fibroblast growth factor  <dig> into the developing mouse cortex and caused a caudal duplication of part of the primary somatosensory area. hamasaki et al.  <cit>  demonstrated changes in the position and or size of primary sensory visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortical regions in transgenic mice over expressing the transcription factor emx <dig>  these and other discoveries  suggest that arealization of the mammalian cortical sheet develops in a manner consonant with principles established for embryonic patterning of the body. signaling centers release morphogens that determine regional growth and tissue identity by regulating regional expression of transcription factors. grove and fukuchi-shimogori  <cit>  note that such research has provided a starting point for investigating how the cortical area map is generated and modified in a single individual and how maps change in the course of evolution, but that a major step forward would be to identify novel transcription factors involved in cortical area patterning. along these lines, funatsu et al.  <cit>  have employed gene expression array analysis of the dissected embryonic  mouse cerebral cortex to expand the list of genes regionally expressed, and noted that regional differences in expression of genes in the cortical plate should eventually convert into functionally distinct cortical areas with anatomically distinguishable borders after birth.

inbred strains of laboratory mice can be exploited to study and understand complex traits of the nervous system if there is significant phenotypic variation with which to correlate gene polymorphism  <cit>  or expression data  <cit> . as the first step to an integrative and relational discovery program  <cit>  in a model system for mammalian cortical area map formation, here we describe significant differences in the cortex of two common inbred strains of laboratory mice, c57bl/6j and dba/2j.

RESULTS
neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex differ between c57bl/6j and dba/2j
using established histochemical methods to visualize neocortical and primary cortical areas , we estimate that neocortex  is on average 7% larger in c57bl/6j  compared to dba/2j  . while both visual cortex and barrel  cortex areas significantly correlate with total neocortex area , each also uniquely differs between strains. using ancova to control for variation in neocortex size, the adjusted mean visual cortex areas for c57bl/6j and dba/2j are  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm <dig>  respectively, a 12% difference . using ancova, the neocortex adjusted mean barrel cortex areas for dba/2j and c57bl/6j are  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm <dig>  respectively, a 10% difference . these results are shown graphically in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  in figure  <dig>  the ancova plot shows that c57bl/6j mice have more visual cortex; the c57bl/6j linear fit is above the dba/2j linear fit. in figure  <dig>  the ancova plot shows that dba/2j mice have more barrel cortex; the dba/2j linear fit is now above the c57bl/6j linear fit, reversed from figure  <dig>  there is no significant evidence for heterogeneity of slopes in the fitted lines from figure  <dig> or figure  <dig> when interaction terms are added to the ancova models.

cortical field size configuration predicts c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains
given the significant differences in neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex areas between c57bl/6j and dba/2j, we can ask how well these measures collectively predict or discriminate strain identity. in a logistic regression model predicting strain identity from neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex areas, the overall model is significant  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit Ï‡ <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), as is neocortex area  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), visual cortex area  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), and barrel cortex area  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). table  <dig> shows the prediction table for this model, revealing  <dig> out of  <dig> mice  were correctly classified by strain. figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> graphically portray these results. figure  <dig> plots the predicted probabilities from the logistic regression model by strain. figure  <dig> plots a projection from a three dimensional rotating plot for neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex. when rotated to the projection shown, a plane  separates the strains with 90% accuracy.

c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains are not differentiated on other dimensions
neither the area of somatosensory cortex  taken as a whole, nor auditory cortex  area was found to be significantly different between strains. subjectively, we found the dorsal border of s <dig>  and the borders of a <dig> to be more difficult to distinguish in our tissue than either v <dig> or pmbsf. neither s <dig> nor a <dig> area measures added significantly to the ability to predict strain identity.

discussion
grove and fukuchi-shimogori  <cit>  and krubitzer and kahn  <cit>  suggest that the cortical map, at least for primary areas, develops independently of thalamic input, by way of signaling centers releasing morphogens that determine areal identity. this is not a claim that thalamic projections to the cortex do not play a role in cortical area map formation  <cit> , but rather that principles of development observed in body embryogenesis are also active in early cortical area map formation. developmental and genetic manipulations have produced striking evidence for a handful of candidate morphogens in cortical area map formation  <cit> . recent gene array expression studies are expanding the list of genes that may act to pattern the mammalian cortex  <cit> . to date, there is little evidence these candidate morphogens cause individual or species differences. an approach that ties candidate or novel morphogens to cortical area map development and anatomy within the range of normal individual differences would prove complementary. complex trait analysis of the mouse central nervous system  <cit> , allied with gene expression approaches  <cit> , can be used with recombinant inbred strains of mice  <cit>  to provide a cumulative, integrative discovery program  <cit>  that has the potential to tie genomic and transcriptomic variation to variation of the central nervous system and the behaving organism. here we provide evidence that the cortical area map differs significantly even in two inbred strains of laboratory mice, c57bl/6j and dba/2j. importantly, these are the parental strains of the bxd recombinant inbred strains  <cit> , and this study thus provides an empirical basis for using this mammalian neurogenetic resource to study cortical development.

in this paper we have shown that neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex differ in area between c57bl/6j and dba/2j inbred strains of mice, and that collectively, these measures accurately discriminate these strains. the relatively greater barrel cortex representation in dba/2j confirms an earlier abstract reporting greater representation of the barrel field in dba/2j compared to c57bl/6j mice  <cit> . the larger neocortex in c57bl/6j is consistent with the larger brain size in this strain  <cit> . the dimension of area is one way to measure the cortical map. other experimental studies have shown changes in field duplication  <cit> , number  <cit> , or position  <cit> . in future studies of either bxd recombinant inbred lines, or of other commercial inbred strains  <cit>  or their derivatives, we suggest that more powerful statistical descriptions of the size and shape of the cortical area map could be used. borrowing from advances in the field of geometric morphometrics  <cit> , methods that have been applied to the genetic architecture of the drosophila wing shape  <cit> , or mouse mandible shape  <cit> , could be applied to the mouse cortical area map, with landmarks defined by classical histochemical or immunohistological stains or by other molecular markers. landmark-based shape statistics are not a panacea for the measurement of biological form  <cit> , but the point with regard to using isogenic strains is that landmarks can be investigated by replicate measures for reliability and can be correlated with genomic data, or transcriptomic data, at a particular developmental milestone, or across milestones. this is a promising research direction that would complement efforts to answer how the cortex develops, what are the functional or dysfunctional consequences for a particular cortical configuration, and even how the cortex has evolved or can evolve  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
inbred strains of laboratory mice can be used to investigate mammalian cortical area map formation if there is significant phenotypic variation with which to correlate gene polymorphism or expression data. adult c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice are markedly different in cortical area maps, suggesting that inbred strains harbor enough phenotypic variation to encourage a forward genetic approach to understanding cortical development, complementing other approaches.
