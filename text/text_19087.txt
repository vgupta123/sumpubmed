BACKGROUND
the subphylum cephalochordata , one of the basal groups of living chordates  <cit> , appears to have maintained its basic body plan for several hundred million years  <cit> . lancelets are widely distributed in tropical and temperate shallow seas and consist of three genera  with more than  <dig> known living species  <cit> . adults are benthic, inhabiting sandy and shell/sand bottoms of clear seawater, while larvae are planktonic in both inshore and offshore areas   <cit> . for a long time, it has been believed that the lancelets prefer such aerobic conditions, whereas recently a new lancelet asymmetron inferum was discovered in an anaerobic and sulfide-rich bottom  <cit> . this species is only distinguishable morphologically from congeners by the number of myomeres  <cit> .

in july  <dig>  during the hyper-dolphin/natsushima cruise of the japan marine science and technology center ,  <dig> specimens of a. inferum were collected from bottom sand subjacent to the decomposing bones of the sperm whale physeter macrocephalus at a depth of  <dig> m, off cape nomamisaki, kyushu island, southwest japan . twelve dead whales that had been stranded on the southwestern coast of kyushu island were submerged in february  <dig>  and then were observed to study the faunal composition and succession of the biological communities associated with whale-falls  <cit> . the submerged bodies of whales on the floor provided rich pickings that resulted in substantial amounts of organic material, lipids, and sulfides for dense biological community comprising of the mytillid mussels adipicola pacifica and a. crypta  <cit>  and the bone-eating marine worm osedax japonicus  <cit> . a. inferum is also a member of this community  <cit> .

this deep  and sulfide-rich habitat is unique to a. inferum in the lancelets. a sulfide-rich environment – including hydrogen sulfide – is generally toxic to macro-organisms. therefore, the adaptation of this species to such a lethal environment is an intriguing phenomenon, but the phylogenetic framework for understanding its processes has not yet been established. nohara et al.  <cit>  conducted molecular phylogenetic analysis of the intra-relationships of some lancelets using whole mitochondrial genome  sequences, but a. inferum and two congeneric species of a. lucayanum complex  <cit>  were not included. to know the phylogenetic position of the whale-fall lancelet a. inferum, we determined the whole mitogenome sequences from three species of the genus asymmetron including this species  to compare with the published data for nohara's a. lucayanum  <cit>  , epigonichthys maldivensis, branchiostoma belcheri, b. lanceolatum and b. floridae as well as three other deuterostomes as outgroups.

RESULTS
features of a. inferum mitogenome
the nucleotide sequences from the mitogenomes of the three asymmetron species have been deposited in ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession numbers of ap <dig> for a. inferum, ap <dig> for asymmetron sp. a, and ap <dig> for asymmetron sp. c . the total lengths of the a. inferum, asymmetron sp. a, and asymmetron sp. c mitogenomes were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  bp, respectively. mitogenomes of the mentioned species of asymmetron, each contained  <dig> genes for large- and small-subunit ribosomal rnas ,  <dig> transfer rnas , and  <dig> proteins , as is generally the case with metazoan mitogenomes . the mitogenome organization of asymmetron sp. a and asymmetron sp. c was identical to that of asymmetron sp. b , while that of a. inferum was unique among the lancelets.

the mitogenome of a. inferum contained  <dig> protein-coding genes, of which one reading-frame overlapped on the same strand . ten protein-coding genes  started with atg, the other protein genes  with gtg . stop codons of protein-coding genes were taa in the atp <dig>  cob, cox <dig>  nad2- <dig>  and nad6; ta in the cox <dig>  and nad4l; and t in the atp <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig>  and nad <dig>  for those genes with an incomplete stop codon, the transcripts would be modified to form the complete termination signal uaa by polyadenylation after cleavage of the polycistronic rna, as demonstrated for other metazoan mitogenomes  <cit> . there were  <dig> trna genes, which were clustered or individually scattered in the genome. the trna genes ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, large enough for the encoded trnas to fold into the cloverleaf secondary structure characteristic of trnas. the trns and trnc lacked the dhu arm, like branchiostoma floridae  <cit> . the ribosomal genes  of a. inferum were  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. they were located, as in other lancelets, between the trnp and trnl genes, being separated by the trnf and trnv genes. there were two major unassignable regions  longer than  <dig> bp in the a. inferum mitogenome. one of the regions  was located at the identical position to mus in the mitogenomes of the a. lucayanum complex   <cit> . the other region , located between the trnm and nad <dig> genes, was unique among the lancelet mitogenomes.

phylogenetic relationships
partitioned bayesian inference  phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> mitogenomes from the concatenated nucleotide sequences from  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna genes, plus  <dig> rrna genes  under the general time reversible model with gamma correction and invariable-site assumption   <cit>  yielded a topology with resolution of the branching pattern among lancelets. all nodes were supported by higher bayesian posterior probabilities . bi analysis using dataset # <dig>  under mtrev + i + Γ  <cit>   and gtr + i + Γ  models produced the same tree topology . all nodes were supported by higher bayesian posterior probabilities . maximum-likelihood  analysis using dataset # <dig> under the transversional substitution model with gamma correction and invariable-site assumption  produced exactly the same tree topology as that found in the bi analyses . most nodes were supported by high bootstrap probabilities , with the exception of a clade comprising b. lanceolatum and b. floridae . heuristic maximum parsimony  analysis of the dataset # <dig> also produced the identical tree topology as in the above analyses . the mp analysis yielded the single most parsimonious tree, with a length of  <dig>  steps . most nodes were supported by high bootstrap values , with the exception of the same clade  as in ml analysis .

divergence time estimation
as a high rate of heterogeneity among lineages of lancelets was observed by the two-cluster test  <cit> , we used two different molecular dating methods, the penalized likelihood   <cit> ) based on the bi tree  and the nonparametric rate smoothing   <cit>  based on the ml tree . the divergence time between a. inferum and a. lucayanum complex was estimated to be  <dig> mya using pl method  or  <dig> mya using nprs method .

discussion
phylogenetic position of a. inferum
our phylogenetic analyses of mitogenome sequences for eight lancelets using bayesian inference , maximum likelihood , and maximum parsimony  methods show that extant lancelets are clustered into two major clades: the asymmetron clade and the epigonichthys + branchiostoma clade . this result is consistent with the findings of nohara et al.  <cit> . the topology of the resulting trees implies that the asymmetrical arrangement of gonads seen paraphyletically in the genus asymmetron and epigonichthys can be regarded as a plesiomorphic feature, supporting the hypothesis that the gonadal symmetry in the genus branchiostoma was derived from the asymmetric epigonichthys-like ancestor  <cit> . nishikawa  <cit>  recovered the genus asymmetron as a valid genus distinct from another valid genus epigonichthys based on four morphological characters as follows: the elongated urostyloid process, marked metapleuran asymmetry, intercirral membrane with abrupt height change between lateral and ventral ones, and posterior shift of the cirral skeletal ring  <cit>  with its anterodorsal extremity located at  the fourth myomere. the present molecular phylogeny shows that these morphological characters of the asymmetron species are phylogenetically informative, supporting his claim. although the a. lucayanum complex includes deep divergence , a. inferum is placed on the sister group to this species complex, not nested within it . this result indicates that the whale-fall lancelet a. inferum was diverged from the circumtropical lancelet a. lucayanum complex before the ancient separation in this complex  <cit> .

gene rearrangement of a. inferum
we discovered that the a. inferum mitogenome has been subjected to large-scale gene rearrangements. to elucidate the relative timing of these gene rearrangements, we mapped gene orders of the lancelet mitogenome onto the phylogenetic tree . gene orders of epigonichthys and branchiostoma are similar to that of typical vertebrate mitogenomes  <cit> , with the exception of slight differences in the location of four trna genes  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the ancestral lancelet gene order is almost the same as that of the epigonichthys and branchiostoma. the a. inferum mitogenome has three novel gene positions:  an inversion extending from the trnl to nad <dig> genes;  transposition of the cox <dig> and nad <dig> genes from between the atp <dig> and the trnr genes to between the cox <dig> and trns genes; and  an inversion of the trnq gene and its transposition from between the trnm and nad <dig> genes to between the nad <dig> and the trns genes. the gene order of this mitogenome can be parsimoniously explained by the following steps: events  and  occurred in the ancestor of all asymmetron species, event  subsequently occurred in the lineage of a. inferum, and event   occurred in the ancestor of a. lucayanum complex . in other words, novel gene positions  and  represent molecular synapomorphies shared among the asymmetron species, and novel gene position  is the synapomorphy of a. lucayanum species complex.

gene position  and existence of mus <dig> are unique to a. inferum. mus <dig>  located at the identical position of trnq in the mitogenomes of a. lucayanum complex, appears to be a trnq pseudogene because of its sequence similarity to the acceptor and anticodon arm regions of trnq of a. inferum and complement sequences of that of a. lucayanum complex . therefore, gene arrangement pattern  may have resulted from two events as follows: the inversion of trnq gene occurred at the original position by recombination of the mitogenome as a possible cause for pattern   <cit> , followed by transposition, involving a tandem genomic duplication and subsequent random deletions of the duplicated part, as invoked for many cases of gene rearrangement in animal mitogenomes .

when and how did a. inferum become a whale-fall specialist?
a. inferum is considered as whale-fall specialist. this species has been found only in the whale-fall community at the “sulfophilic stage”  and has never been found elsewhere including shallow waters, wood-falls, cold seeps, or hydrothermal vents  <cit> . therefore, it is natural to suppose that this lancelet may make use of the lipid-and-sulfide-rich or the organic material as a food source like other community members  <cit> . so far as the gross anatomy is concerned, there are no significant differences between a. inferum and its shallow-water congeners  <cit> , which indicates that a. inferum may be a filter-feeder like its congeners. the mechanism of feeding of this whale-fall lancelet still remains as an open question.

when did a. inferum adapt to sulfide-rich environment? to examine the timing of a. inferum lineage, we estimated the divergence time between a. inferum and the other species of asymmetron inhabiting coral reefs. with a slight difference between two resultant estimations of  <dig> mya  and  <dig> mya  , these appear far older than the first appearance of large whales, represented by the inshore archeocetacean basilosaulus   <cit> . therefore, an a. inferum-like ancestor seems to have become a member of the whale-fall community after more than  <dig> million years of the emergence of a. inferum lineage . prior to the appearance of large whales, there were the cenozoic or mesozoic large fishes  and the mesozoic reptiles  in the sea  <cit> . these large fishes and reptiles in the mesozoic may have played an ecological role similar to the whales on the sea floor, as suggested by martill et al.  <cit>  and hogler  <cit> . a. inferum may have been a member of these large vertebrate-fall communities before becoming a whale-fall specialist.

another whale-fall specialist, the bone-eating marine worm osedax also shows ancient divergence time  from its sister group  ; however, the divergence time within osedax   <cit>  coincides with the first appearance of the large whales, based on the molecular clock. in the whale-fall bathymodiolin bivalves of the genera adipicola and idas, the divergence time  is synchronous with the major radiation of unequivocally oceanic whales  <cit> , based on molecular age estimation  and the fossil records  <cit> . this synchronicity suggests that high sulfide-rich habitats derived from large whales with oil-rich bones  <cit>  may play an important role in the divergences of osedax, adipicola, and idas. their tolerance and utilization of sulfide may have already been developed at the time of their invasion into whale-fall communities, because their sister groups are chemosymbiotic  <cit> , provided actually or potentially with these abilities.

unlike these whale-fall specialists, the a. inferum-like ancestor might have had a very low sulfide tolerance, because its sister group, a. lucayanum complex, and all the remaining lancelets inhabit aerobic environments  <cit> . this does not necessarily deny our hypothesis that a. inferum lineage may have started its life-mode as a vertebrate-fall specialist in the mesozoic, because, unlike modern whale-falls with oil-rich bones, the mesozoic large vertebrate-falls may possibly have lacked sulfophilic stages during decomposition  <cit> , resulting in a low concentration of sulfide. subsequently, the a. inferum lineage may have come to gain the sulfide tolerance to become a whale-fall specialist.

CONCLUSIONS
the trees based on the whole mitogenome sequences show that the whale-fall specialist a. inferum is the sister group to the coral reef lancelet a. lucayanum complex, supporting the monophyly of the genus asymmetron, assumed on the basis of the morphological characters. furthermore, the features of the a. inferum mitogenome expand our knowledge of variation within cephalochordate mitogenomes, adding new cases of inversion and transposition of the trnq gene. novel gene orders in asymmetron were found to be useful for phylogenetic inference.

the divergence time between a. inferum and its sister group a. lucayanum complex is estimated to be  <dig> mya or  <dig> mya , which is older than the first appearance of large whales . our results raise the possibility that a. inferum lineage was initially a member of the mesozoic and the early cenozoic large vertebrate-fall communities, and subsequently shifting to become a whale-fall specialist.
