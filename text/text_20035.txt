BACKGROUND
high oil prices, growing concerns over national security and climate change are driving investment and innovation in the renewable alternative fuels  <cit> . among various potentially alternatives, butanol has been proposed as an excellent substitute or supplement for gasoline, and has been demonstrated to work in some vehicles designed for use with gasoline without any engine modification  <cit> . in addition to manufacture from petroleum through chemical refinery process, industry production of butanol is typically through a so-called abe fermentation process employing gram-positive, spore forming and anaerobic organism clostridium acetobutylicum  <cit> . c. acetobutylicum is capable of producing a mixture of acetone , butanol  and ethanol  from a variety of carbohydrate substrates such as starch  <cit> . according to an estimate in  <dig>  butanol accounted for a 7- <dig>  billon us dollar market worldwide and has a projected market expansion of 3% per year in the near future  <cit> .

significant efforts have been spent on physiological and genetic characterization of solvent-producing c. acetobutylicum in the past decades  <cit> , and tools for genetic manipulation of c. acetobutylicum were also developed  <cit> . in  <dig>  the whole genome of well studied c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> was sequenced, revealing a  <dig>  mb chromosome which encodes  <dig> open reading frames , and a  <dig> kb megaplasmid which encodes  <dig> orfs  <cit> . afterwards, a series of studies employing global approaches have been performed  <cit> , and the genome-scale metabolic model of c. acetobutylicum was also constructed  <cit> . these efforts have improved the understanding of regulatory and metabolic networks of this industry significant species.

however, most of the c. acetobutylicum strains are not optimized systems for butanol production because their spore-forming life cycle decreases the efficiency of industrial fermentation, and the abe fermentation process also creates a number of by-products, such as h <dig>  acetic, lactic and propionic acids, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol  <cit> . as a result, the butanol yield is difficult to control and a significant amount of energy is wasted in these by-products. moreover, it also increases the cost of downstream butanol purification. to address these issues, various modification approaches, such as mutagenesis by chemical or radiation agents, and genetic engineering, have been performed to improve the butanol production  <cit> . our laboratory has previously obtained a high butanol producing strain, c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig>  through butanol resistance screening of n-methyl-n-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine  treated clostridium strain isolated from soil  <cit> . preliminary results in a 100-ton continuous fermenter showed that butanol ratio and starch conversion rates of ea  <dig> strain were 10% and 5% higher than those reported in recent literature  <cit> . to explore the genetic difference between ea  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  in this study, the c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> genome was sequenced using roche  <dig> pyrosequencing together with traditional sanger sequencing. in addition, comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of ea  <dig> and atcc  <dig> were also performed. the study, for the first time, provides a molecular-level understanding of higher solvent production, enhanced xylose utilization and non-sporulation in the mutant ea  <dig>  the information could be valuable for further genetic modification of c. acetobutylicum for more effective butanol production.

RESULTS
characterization of isolate ea 2018
the original solvent producing strain was isolated by our laboratory previously  <cit> . after several rounds of mutagenesis using ntg , we obtained a hyper butanol-producing strain designated as ea  <dig>  this strain was later identified as clostridium acetobutylicum by the china center for type culture collection  and was kept in cctcc under the preservation no. cctcc m_ <dig>  in this work, the 16s rdna of c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> was cloned and sequenced. the  <dig> bp 16s rdna sequence of c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> was 100% identical to that of the type strain c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, the sol operon involved in butanol production was also cloned from c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> and sequenced, the comparative analysis showed that the sol operon of c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> was also 100% identical to that of c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>   <cit> . the analysis demonstrated that ea  <dig> and atcc  <dig> belong to the same species.

fermentation experiments were performed to compare the solvent production patterns of c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  ea  <dig> exhibited higher solvent formation capacity than atcc  <dig> strain in either 6%  glucose or xylose media . after  <dig> h fermentation,  <dig>  g/l glucose remained in the ea  <dig> culture, while  <dig>  g/l glucose still remained in the atcc  <dig> culture after  <dig> h fermentation . after  <dig> h fermentation,  <dig>  g/l xylose was present in the ea  <dig> culture, while  <dig>  g/l xylose was still remained in the atcc  <dig> culture . in most c. acetobutylicum strains, solvent formation is always coupled with initiation of sporulation  <cit> . however, after fermentation of  <dig> h, there was no spore found in ea  <dig> cultures, while significant spores were found in atcc  <dig>  with its higher solvent production and non-spore forming characteristics, ea  <dig> strain could be an excellent strain for industrial application.

overview of c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> genome
for better understanding of the genetic basis of improved butanol producing characteristics in ea  <dig>  the whole genome of ea  <dig> was sequenced. the genome has a circular chromosome consisting of  <dig> , <dig> bp with an average g+c content of  <dig> % and a circular megaplasmid of  <dig>  bp with an average g+c content of  <dig> %. the genome finishing procedures were listed in additional file  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  a total of  <dig> protein coding sequence  including  <dig>  in chromosome and  <dig> in megaplasmid were indentified in the ea  <dig> genome, representing  <dig> % of the genome and  <dig> % of the megaplasmid, respectively. the functional classification of all ea  <dig> genes was listed in table  <dig>  there are  <dig> copies of rdna operons and a total of  <dig> trna genes scattered over the ea  <dig> genome. genomic comparison with type strain atcc  <dig> revealed the highly conserved gene content and gene order between these two strains. the base numbering start point of ea  <dig> were chosen as the same site in atcc  <dig> .

comparative genomic analysis of ea  <dig> and atcc 824
the size of the ea  <dig> chromosome is  <dig> bp smaller than that of atcc  <dig>  and the size of the ea  <dig> megaplasmid is  <dig> bp smaller than that of atcc  <dig>  compared with atcc  <dig>  a total of  <dig> deletion sites and  <dig> insertion sites were found across the ea  <dig> genome, including  <dig> deletion site in the megaplasmid . among them,  <dig> sites are single nucleotide indel , and only  <dig> indel sites are larger than  <dig> bp. the largest insertion is  <dig> bp in 1276337- <dig> which is located within a hypothetical protein gene , while the largest deletion is  <dig> bp in 1112030- <dig> which is located within a predicted member protein gene . apart from those indels,  <dig> single nucleotide variations  were identified between the two chromosomes, and  <dig> snvs were identified between the megaplasmid of ea  <dig> and atcc  <dig> . the  <dig> variations  affected a total of  <dig> protein encoding genes  and  <dig> predicted promoters  in the ea  <dig> genome. excluding the synonymous substitution, a total of  <dig> proteins had amino acids changes, while  <dig> of those proteins were with similar amino acid variations . the  <dig> genes with their putative promoters affected were listed in additional file  <dig>  in table  <dig> and  <dig>  variations within putative promoters and genes related to solvent formation, xylose utilization, and spore formation  were listed.

comparative transcriptomic analysis of ea  <dig> and atcc 824
to further explore the molecular mechanism of enhanced butanol production in the ea  <dig> strain, dna microarray of c. acetobutylicum were manufactured and used for a comparative analysis between ea  <dig> and atcc  <dig>  the complete set of dna array data was available in additional file  <dig>  microarray analysis showed that a total of  <dig> genes were differentially regulated at transcriptional level in at least  <dig> cultivation time point. among them, differentially regulated genes related to some important metabolic pathways were listed in table  <dig>  and some putative promoter variation genes such as adheii were found with differential expression level in the ea  <dig> strain . the detailed comparative analysis of transcriptomic data, along with genomic data  and biochemical phenotypes will be provided below from three key aspects related to enhanced butanol production .

changes in expression of adheii, spo0a and hydrogenase gene may contribute to enhanced solvent formation in ea 2018
comparative genomic analysis identified a set of solvent-relevant genes with variations within their coding sequences . and most of which were snv variations, such as genes encoding phosphotransacetylase and acetyl-coa acetyltransferase. in addition, comparative genomics analysis also identified some variations up-stream of solvent-relevant genes , which could potentially affect expression level of these genes. for example, a snv site was found  <dig> bases upstream of the start codon of the adheii encoded gene cea_p <dig> , under the s <dig> transcription start point  <cit> . consistent with the variations at genomic level, we also found that transcription level of solvents formation genes, such as adheii were highly expressed in ea  <dig> relative to atcc  <dig> 

spo0a is a central regulator of sporulation and solvent formation in c. acetobutylicum. previous studies showed that c. acetobutylicum spo0a inactivation mutant stops producing spores and solvent, while over-expression of spo0a gene can enhance solvent production since 0a binding boxes have been identified in the promoter regions of solvent formation genes  <cit> . therefore, it is speculative that the higher expression of spo0a could be one of the reasons for the higher butanol formation in ea  <dig>  comparative transcriptomic analysis confirmed our speculation that higher transcriptional level of spo0a was found in ea  <dig> . there were three ways for spo0a to be phosphorylated   <cit> . using trans-membrane domain along with transcriptional analysis, four orphan kinases  were identified as plausible kinases that might phosphorylate spo0a in b. subtilis  <cit> . in our study, we also found that the transcriptional level of an orphan kinase cea_g <dig>  was higher in ea  <dig> , and the result is consistent well with the spo0a gene expression data.

during solvent fermentation process in c. acetobutylicum, a considerable amount of nadh was consumed by hydrogenase via reduced fd  to form hydrogen  <cit> . previous reports showed that butanol production by c. acetobutylicum can be elevated by inhibiting hydrogen formation through adding viologen dyes or increasing hydrogen partial pressure  <cit> , and knockdown of hupcba cluster which encoded hydrogen uptake genes in c. saccharoperbutylacetonicum strain n1- <dig> decreased butanol formation  successfully  <cit> . biochemical analysis showed that hydrogen formation in ea  <dig> was nearly 29% lower than in atcc  <dig> . interestingly, comparative genomic analysis also revealed snvs in nife-hydrogenase coded gene cea_p <dig>  and in the promoter of fe-only hydrogenase coded gene cea_g <dig>  . the variation site of cea_g  <dig> was located on the 12th base upstream of the start codon of hyda and altered the ribosome binding site  of this important gene . in addition, the higher expression level of hydrogen uptake genes mbhs and mbhl were also revealed in ea  <dig> . the result showed that hydrogen uptake could be an important factor for butanol formation, and increased expression level of hydrogen uptake gene mbhs and mbhl was closely correlated to the lower hydrogen formation in ea  <dig>  which can eventually help balance the nadh needed for higher production of butanol.

using non-replicating plasmid po1x, putative solvent formation repressor solr gene was inactivated in attc  <dig>  and its fermentation experiment revealed that more solvent were produced in the solr inactivation mutant  <cit> . although there are different speculations on the function of solr  <cit> , it has been confirmed that low expression of solr will enhance solvent formation  <cit> . transcriptomic analysis revealed a lower expression level of solr, especially in the solventogenic phase in ea  <dig>  which might be related to hyper-butanol formation .

it has been suggested that the onset of solvent production is closely related to the accumulation of acid end products  <cit> , and the addition of acetate and butyrate might result in a rapid induction of solventogenesis  <cit> . for example, it was reported that the concentration of undissociated butyric acid might play an important role in the induction of solventogenesis  <cit> . transcriptomic analysis showed that expression of ack, pta, buk and ptb were all lower in ea  <dig> than in atcc  <dig> , consistent with the biochemical analysis . in addition, the results also suggested that the transition to the solventogenesis took place at a lower acetate and butyrate acid concentration in ea  <dig> compared to atcc  <dig> 

analysis of substrate utilization genes and inactivation of cac <dig> revealed genetic bases of better xylose utilization in ea 2018
solvent production from agriculturally based lignocellulosic substrates  was studied previously and results showed that a large part of the lignocellulosic substrates were hydrolyzed into glucose and xylose  <cit> . therefore, utilization of these substrates, especially xylose, can be important in determining the efficiency of solvent production. comparative genomic analysis identified several mutations in the putative promoters and within the coding region of genes which might be involved in substrates utilization . among them, three out of seven mutated genes encode sugar-binding periplasmic proteins. one interesting gene was cea_g <dig> , which encodes a transcriptional regulator of nagc/xylr family and the sequence variation could cause a putative w90c substitution. the gene is located on the upstream of xylb  gene . since most of the known xylr genes in other at-rich gram-positive species such as b. subtillus and c. difficile were located upstream of xyl operon  <cit> , we speculated that this gene  may function similarly as xylr in ea  <dig> . transcriptomic analysis showed that even in the glucose-based medium, the expression level of xylb was higher in ea  <dig> . however, evidence is still needed to confirm the direct regulatory function of cea_g <dig> on xyl operon. to do so, we disrupted cac <dig> gene in c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  using targetron system . batch fermentation showed that xylose utilization in cac <dig> disrupted mutant was faster than atcc  <dig> . in addition, the time of butanol formation and acids reassimilation in the mutant were  <dig> h earlier than atcc  <dig> strain, although the final concentration of end products and xylose were nearly the same . the similarities, in terms of the time of butanol formation and acid reassimilation, between ea  <dig> and the cac <dig> disrupted atcc  <dig> derived mutant, suggested that better xylose utilization in ea  <dig> could be related to the mutation in cea_g <dig> .

previous study showed that atcc  <dig> harbors extracellular and cell bound xylanase activities when grown under xylose or glucose-based media, and most of the putative xylanase encoded genes were located on the megaplasmid  <cit> . two endoxylanase genes, thermostable xylanase 10a gene  and xylanase 10b gene  located on mega-plasmid were identified in ea  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, transcriptomic analysis showed higher expression level of those two genes in ea  <dig> . xylan is the major component of hemicelluloses. the higher expression level of xylanase in ea  <dig> could make it suitable for hemicellulosic fermentation, and could offer potential economic benefits in the future  <cit> .

among all putative promoter variations, there were  <dig> sites which may affect substrate utilization in ea  <dig> . among them, cea_g <dig>  gene that encodes a catabolite control protein  has a variation site located on  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon. ccpa play an important role in catabolite repression and inactivation of this gene will release catabolic repression in many gram-positive organisms  <cit> . however, no significant regulation was observed for the expression level of ccpa gene in ea  <dig>  and the potential effect of the variation in ccpa promoter region still needs further investigation.

agrc and sigma factor variations may involve in spore formation in ea 2018
comparative genomic analysis identified several genes which may be accounted for difference in terms of spore formation . among these muted genes, cea_g <dig>  encodes a putative sigma factor. it has been known that the transcription of this gene was closely related to spore-formation in atcc  <dig>  <cit> . cea_g <dig> has a single nucleotide  insertion site in 687-688th bases, which altered the c-terminal protein sequence. transcriptomic analysis showed that the transcription level of cea_g <dig> and other  <dig> putative sporulation related sigma factors  <cit>  was lower in ea  <dig> at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h , which might contribute to non-sporulation property in ea  <dig> 

quarum sensing is related to some important characteristics of bacteria, such as sporulation, virulence, and biofilm formation  <cit> . in c. perfringens, the virulence gene was regulated by agr system, and agrbd knockout mutant did not express theta-toxin gene, and transcription of the alpha- and kappa-toxin genes was also significantly decreased in the mutant strain  <cit> . a two-component system gene, cea_g <dig> , encoding a histidine kinase-like atpase , has a single nucleotide  insertion site in 1159-1160th bases when compared with agrc gene in atcc  <dig>  which may truncate the protein encoding sequence. in addition, the expression level of agrb  was constantly lower in ea  <dig> . early studies suggested that deletion of any agr system genes could result in no spore formation in atcc  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, mutation in agrc gene and lower expression of agrb gene in ea  <dig> might be responsible for to the non-sporulation property in ea  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
a hyper-butanol, non spore-forming c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> strain we isolated previously can produce 10% more butanol than the type strain c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  <cit> . to seek molecular basis of these characteristics in ea  <dig> strain, we completed the genome sequencing of this strain using  <dig> gs flx pyrosequceing and performed a detailed genomic comparison with a c. acetobutylicum type strain atcc  <dig>  although ea  <dig> was found more than  <dig> % identical to atcc  <dig>   <dig> indels  and  <dig> snvs were identified, some of which may be related to the enhanced butanol production in ea  <dig>  in addition, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of c. acetobutylicum ea  <dig> and atcc  <dig> using oligonucleotide microarrays. the results showed that increased expression of several key genes related to solvent formation, and decreased expression of the acid formation related genes may be related to the enhanced butanol production in ea  <dig>  furthermore, the results also showed that the variation in cea_g <dig> , a putative transcriptional regulator involved in xylose utilization, may be able to accelerate utilization of substarte xylose. the comparisons of hyper-butanol ea  <dig> and type strain atcc  <dig> at both genomic and transcriptomic levels not only improved our understanding of the hyper butanol-producing, xylose utilization as well as non-spore formation properties in ea  <dig> strain, but also provided some useful clues for the future genetic modification of c. acetobutylicum to produce solvents, especially butanol more effectively.
