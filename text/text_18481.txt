BACKGROUND
hop  plants are mainly cultivated for the brewing industry, as a source of flavor-active secondary metabolites contained in the lupulin glands, i.e. glandular trichomes that develop in the hop female inflorescences . in addition, hop has been known for a long time in traditional medicine and recently several compounds in the lupulin metabolome, including hop bitter acids and prenylated flavonoids, have received particular attention in view of their highly interesting medicinal properties e.g.,  <cit> . xanthohumol , the principal prenylated chalcone in the lupulin glands is a fascinating cancer-chemopreventive compound exhibiting a broad spectrum of inhibition mechanisms at all stages of carcinogenesis  <cit> . although x was shown to be poorly bioavailable  <cit> , interesting anti-inflammatory in vivo results have been obtained in specific target tissues such as the liver  <cit> . another lupulin-derived prenylflavonoid, 8-prenylnaringenin , is one of the most potent phytoestrogens known to date  <cit> . together with its precursor isoxanthohumol which can be metabolized in the body by the gut microbiota to 8-pn  <cit> , these compounds are indicated as the active ingredients of hop extracts targeting relief of menopausal symptoms  <cit> .

the biosynthesis of naringenin chalcone in hop cones as a prenylflavonoid precursor is attributed to the gene encoding the chs_h <dig> protein having a so-called "true" chalcone synthase  activity, by which it efficiently catalyzes the production of naringenin chalcone by condensation of three malonyl-coa units and p-coumaroyl-coa  <cit> . moreover, recombinant chs_h <dig> can utilize isovaleryl and isobutyryl coa substrates, albeit at a low rate, and, therefore, could also be involved in the biosynthesis of hop bitter acids  <cit> . chs_h <dig> is encoded by an oligofamily of genes having very specific expression in hop cones  <cit> . other chalcone synthase-like enzymes associated with lupulin glands have been described. for instance, valerophenone synthase   <cit>  is an enzyme which may be considered as a major component in the biosynthesis of hop bitter acids. the vps-like homologue chs <dig> also shows high expression in lupulin glands, however the enzyme does not catalyze the formation of naringenin chalcone and its function is currently still unknown  <cit> .

the complexity of the promoter elements of the chs_h <dig> genes suggests the involvement of several types of transcription factors , mainly from myb, bhlh, and bzip families  <cit> , in either independent or combinatorial pathways  <cit> . independent or combinatorial activity of tfs in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthetic pathways has been described in several recent reviews  <cit> . three tfs, i.e., r2r3myb , bhlh , and wdr , exert combinatorial activation by formation of ternary complexes  through protein:protein interactions  <cit> . such mbw complexes are highly organized and each subunit fulfills a specific function such as binding to dna, activation of expression of a target gene or stabilization of the transcription factor complex  <cit> . mbw complexes have been clearly identified in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of arabidopsis thaliana and petunia hybrida, respectively, as a tt2/tt8/ttg <dig> complex  driving coloration of the seed coat  <cit>  and a triple combination complex an2/an1/an <dig>  regulating anthocyanin accumulation in the corolla; for reviews, see also  <cit> . the regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway by ternary complexes has also been shown in peas  <cit>  and lotus japonicus  <cit>  and has been proposed for perilla frutescens  <cit> , japanese morning glory  <cit> , grapevine  <cit>  and pyrus  <cit> .

besides triple combinations, numerous examples from classic genetic or molecular genetic studies using ectopic tf expression analysis have documented or predicted enhanced flavonoid biosynthesis by binary complexes composed of two tfs from the r2r3myb, bhlh, and wdr classes  <cit> .

for the hop chs_h <dig> genes, direct promoter activation by the heterologous pap <dig> tf from arabidopsis thaliana and hlbzip <dig> and hlbzip <dig> tfs from hop has been demonstrated previously using a transient expression system  <cit> . two hop r2r3myb tfs, i.e. hlmyb <dig> and hlmyb <dig>  have been characterized in our previous studies  <cit>  and diverse biological effects caused by hlmyb <dig> subvariants have been demonstrated in heterologous transgenotes  <cit> . although these myb tfs were suggested to be involved in the lupulin metabolome production based on sequence similarity and specific expression in hop cones  <cit> , their influence on the activation of chs genes has not been investigated in detail.

in the present work, we cloned novel lupulin-specific tfs and showed by a combinatorial transient expression assay that the hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig> tfs strongly activate the chs_h <dig> genes in combinations with hlmyb <dig> and hlmyb <dig> tfs from hop, suggesting the formation of ternary complexes. this study confirms that the mode of action of the tfs strongly depends on the composition of the chs promoter and that hlmyb <dig> acts as a repressor of activating complexes.

RESULTS
cloning, comparative sequence and genomic analyses of r2r3myb, bhlh and wdr transcription factors from hop
during our previous work, we cloned two authentic r2r3myb tfs having specific expression in cones of the czech hop variety osvald's  <dig>  i.e., hlmyb <dig>   <cit>  and hlmyb <dig>   <cit> . in the present work, we isolated and purified lupulin glands from osvald's  <dig> according to nagel et al.  <cit>  and constructed a lupulin gland-specific cdna library. this cdna library is more specific and more complex  than the previously constructed cdna library from hop inflorescences and cones  <cit> . we used sequence motifs for two r2r3myb tfs available in the genbank database , to amplify hlmyb <dig>  and hlmyb <dig> , respectively, from the cdna library. both clones differed in several point mutations and, in addition, an  <dig> bp deletion was found for the clone hlmyb <dig> in comparison with the original database sequence . the full-length clones of hlbhlh <dig>  were obtained by screening of hop est sequences after pre-selections of 5' and 3' cdna motifs in the trichome database . to get full length cdna clones of hlwdr <dig>  we firstly identified the 5' region from est of the h. lupulus var. phoenix. full-length cdna was obtained from a lupulin gland-specific library of the osvald's  <dig> cv. using a combination of a 5'primer and an oligo-dt anchor primer followed by nested pcr as described in methods. the authenticity of all newly obtained cds sequences was verified by sequencing of the high-fidelity rt-pcr clones.

at present,  <dig> full-length r2r3myb factors from the osvald's  <dig> cultivar are available in the sequence database. from these sequences, the two newly cloned hlmyb <dig> and hlmyb <dig> showed high amino acid identity from  <dig> to 82% within the r2r <dig> domain to a. thaliana atmyb <dig>  and p <dig> tfs from z. mays  involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis. a more wide comparison with various related r2r <dig> myb tfs selected from blast analysis shows the positioning of hlmyb <dig> and hlmyb <dig> in different closely related clusters . the previously cloned hlmyb <dig>  <cit>  is clustering together with hlmyb <dig>  however, this sequence is less related to zmp <dig>  hlmyb <dig> that was found earlier as metabolome regulator  <cit>  is clustering together with c. sativa, v. vinifera, and g. hirsutum mybs as described previously  <cit> . this tf is clustering together with hlmyb <dig>  while two other hop mybs  <dig> and  <dig> are quite unrelated and are not included in the analyzed dataset of myb sequences . within the presented r2r3mybs, some of them were proven to be involved in anthocyanin metabolism or/and trichome development forming ternary bmw complexes such as attt <dig> , atmyb <dig> , atmyb <dig>  and pian <dig> from p. integrifolia .

hlmyb <dig> represents a typical r2r3myb, with a predicted mass of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . hlmyb <dig> is an r2r3myb with a predicted protein mass of  <dig>  kda and pi of  <dig> . these characteristics are close to other myb tfs forming ternary complexes like tt <dig> from a. thaliana  or an <dig> from p. hybrida . in the same range of the molecular mass, but more acidic, are the subvariants of hop myb <dig>  i.e., s-hlmyb <dig>  and l-hlmyb <dig> . in the c-terminal region of hlmyb <dig>  we identified a pdlnlelris motif which conforms to the consensus pdlnld/elxig/s characteristic for plant myb repressors  <cit>  described in a. thaliana and z. mays  <cit>  and showing similarities to ii ap2/erf transcriptional repressors  <cit> . while the r <dig> repeat in hlmyb <dig> perfectly matches the sub-group iiif bhlh interaction motif  l×2×3l×6l×3r  <cit> , the hlmyb <dig> sequence matches this motif only partly  and in hlmyb <dig> this motif is absent . however, the following consensus sequence. lllclhphhgnrwshiath  is characteristic for this interacting region, where most positions of putative interacting residues  are hydrophobic amino acids exposed on the surface.

the cloned hlbhlh <dig> cdna sequence encoded for an acidic  protein having a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. according to analysis of bhlh domains of selected plant bhlh tfs sequences from blast and from the dataset of carretero-paulet et al. <cit> , hlbhlh <dig> shows the highest similarity to bhlh an <dig> from p. hybrida . it is clustering with several bhlh tfs that are involved in the regulation of the anthocyanin pathway, and belongs to wide cluster covering tfs with biological functions connected to flavonoid/anthocyanin metabolism, trichome, stomatal complex and flower development within functional classes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as arranged by carretero-paulet et al. <cit>  . some of the related sequences were described to form mbw complexes . comparisons of the bhlh basic regions revealed the presence of amino acid motif  in the hlbhlh <dig> domain characteristic for g-box binders  <cit> , similarly to well characterized bhlh an <dig> from p. hybrida and bhlh tt <dig> from a. thaliana  <cit>  .

the cloned hlwdr <dig> cdna encodes for a  <dig> kda protein having a pi of  <dig> . phylogenetic analysis of this tf using sequences selected from blast revealed closely related wdr clusters within the group of dicotyledonous plants . most of these tfs were proven to regulate anthocyanin metabolism and some of them to form mbw complexes. hlwdr <dig> showed the highest similarity to recently reported sequences isolated from pear, apple, plum and raspberry . hop wdr <dig> shares  <dig> % of identical amino acid with the an <dig> protein from p. hybrida originally characterized as a plant wdr by de vetten et al.  <cit>  . more detailed comparisons of hlwdr <dig> with phan <dig> identified five polypeptide sequences that constitute the wd-repeats according to  <cit> . only nine non-equivalent positions were identified in the hlwdr <dig> repeats in comparison to phan <dig> .

in order to assess the complexity of the genes encoding the newly cloned hop transcription factors hlmyb <dig>  hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig>  southern blot analysis was carried out on genomic dna isolated from the hop cultivar osvald's  <dig> and digested with several restriction enzymes selected on the basis of the known cdna sequences. hybridization with probes created from cdna fragments of hlmyb <dig>  hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig> genes showed single bands for all tested genes  when digested with ecori , xhoi , xbai , psti , bglii  and bamhi  enzymes. this suggests that the cloned hop transcription factors hlmyb <dig>  hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig> are rather unique in the hop genome of osvald's  <dig>  the occurrence of two bands in the case of hlbhlh <dig> cleaved with ecori  and hlmyb <dig> cleaved with xbai  is likely due to cleavage within some intron.

comparative expression level analyses of the transcription factors hlmyb 2/ <dig>  hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig> in hop tissues show specificity for lupulin glands
myb, bhlh and wdr genes from hop were amplified by the use of sequence motifs preselected from trichome databases and cloned from a cdna library prepared from purified glandular trichomes. this corroborated to an initial specificity for lupulin glands. in order to verify the specificity of the expression of the cloned hop tfs hlmyb <dig>  hlmyb <dig>  hlbhlh <dig>  hlwdr <dig> we analyzed mrna levels in various tissues using real-time quantitative pcr . glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  mrna was selected as a housekeeping gene for normalization based on previous experience and reports from others  <cit> . in order to avoid rna contaminations from hop cone bracts, the lupulin glands of clone osvald's  <dig> were carefully separated and purified as recommended by nagel et al.  <cit> . the gapdh-normalized results show that hlmyb <dig> expression is highly specific for lupulin glands  as the relative expression levels in flowers and young cones only amounted to approximately 5% while in other tissues only traces of the pcr product were found. almost identical results were obtained for hlbhlh <dig> , where expression of only about 1% were detected in tissues other than purified lupulin glands. a 4% relative expression level was detected in whole young cones. the expression of hlwdr <dig> was less specific for lupulin glands . a highly significant relative expression level of this tf, reaching more than 20%, was observed in petioles, flowers and in whole young cones, where maturating lupulin glands comprise only a negligible fraction of total weight of the cone tissues. in addition, immature pollen was found to have hlwdr <dig> mrna relative expression levels of about 10%. furthermore, lower expression of hlwdr <dig> was detected in somatic tissues such as young leaves and roots . the lowest specificity for lupulin glands was observed for hlmyb <dig>  where roots and whole young cones were found to contain a relative expression level of 57% and 35%, respectively, whereas other tissues including leaves, flowers and immature pollen also showed high expression levels of over 15% .

combinatorial transient expression analysis of selected lupulin gland tfs revealed a complex activation of pchs_h <dig> and chs_h1
according to our results, hlmyb <dig> and hlbhlh <dig> exhibited high specific expression in lupulin glands similar to the previously investigated hlmyb <dig>  <cit> . although the expression of hlwdr <dig> and hlmyb <dig> showed a lower specificity, their relative expression levels were still most pronounced in the glandular trichomes. given the high sequence similarity of all these tfs to known regulators of the flavonoid pathway and their specific expression pattern, it is likely that these tfs are involved in the regulation of genes like chs_h <dig>  that are anticipated to be involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in the lupulin glands  <cit> .

to assess the function of the cloned tfs we have used a"combinatorial transient expression"system that was developed previously  <cit> . in this assay the activation of chs_h <dig> promoter  fused to the gus reference gene  is measured after co-infiltration of a. tumefaciens bearing pchs_h <dig> and hop tfs vectors in various combinations into n. benthamiana leaves. only negligible background signal resulting from activation of pchs_h <dig> by internal leaf tfs was detected  <cit> .

pchs_h <dig> contains several myb and bhlh-binding boxes as described previously  <cit>  and analyzed further in this work . according to the place database the sequence tcctacc  containing the consensus of the z. mays p factor binding box ccwacc  <cit>  was identified at position - <dig> to - <dig>  this potential tf binding box was of high interest in relation to the significant similarity of the newly cloned hlmyb <dig> and hlmyb <dig> to this zmp <dig> factor . at position - <dig> to - <dig> a myb-like box was identified using the genomatix database  with a consensus for ga-myb proteins  <cit> . for position - <dig> to - <dig> the sequence caccaaac conforming to the myb-p-related consensus sequence maccwamc was found using the place database  <cit>  and at position - <dig> to - <dig> a plant myb iig-type-like binding site was identified, i.e., taaggtagttga , which is similar to the z. mays c <dig> myb-domain protein   <cit> . in addition, two typical bhlh g-binding boxes with the sequence cacgtg, that could be important for hlbhlh2-mediated activation of pchs_h <dig>  <cit> , were identified at positions - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig> .

the maximum values of transient gus activity was reached at  <dig> to  <dig> h post-infiltration and declined thereafter dependent on the tf or tfs combination co-infiltrated. for example, hlmyb <dig> variants and all complexes containing the hlmyb <dig> gene peaked at  <dig> days post infiltration , whereas the hlmyb <dig> gene reached maximum activity 66- <dig> h dpi, except for the m2w <dig> binary complex.

according to our results, a weak activation of pchs_h <dig> was observed after co-infiltration with hlmyb <dig> . a very weak activation signal on the level of  <dig> pmol mu/mg/min was found for hlmyb <dig> in accordance to our previous study  <cit> . a similar very low activation of pchs_h <dig> was found for hlbhlh <dig>  despite the presence of two bhlh g-boxes , and no activation exceeding the background signal was observed when hlwdr <dig> tf was applied by itself . however, dramatic increases of the activation of pchs_h <dig> were observed both in myb/bhlh binary and ternary combinations of the tfs under investigation . the ternary combination led to  <dig> ±  <dig> pmol mu/mg/min for m3b2w <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> pmol mu/mg/min for m2b2w <dig> . the m2b2w <dig> combination significantly exceeded the activation caused by the strong constitutive 35s promoter of camv .

in order to assay the real activation of transcription of chs_h <dig> genes having very conserved promoter regions  <cit>  we performed the co-infiltration of tfs with the "native" chs_h <dig> gene containing the natural intron sequence  as described earlier  <cit> . the relative expression levels of chs_h <dig> mrna were then measured by rt qpcr and 35s:chs_h <dig> was used as a reference . in correspondence to the previous results, the ternary combinations m3b2w <dig> and m2b2w <dig> were found to strongly activate the natural chs_h <dig> gene construct thereby showing good accordance between both assays.

to enable the characterization of the binding sites responsible for the strong activation observed with both m3b2w <dig> and m2b2w <dig>  a series of truncated variants of pchs_h <dig> lacking the predicted tf-binding boxes were inserted  in the gus reference vector  and assayed in a transient expression system . the majority of promoter activity  was found to depend on the presence of the mybp box, although a significant activity  was still observed in variant  <dig> containing the myb-like box, myb-p like box, myb-c box and two g-boxes . by removal of the boxes, the promoter activity is gradually decreasing in a similar fashion for both ternary combinations to the low activity of construct  <dig> containing a single g-box. in order to confirm the high dependency of pchs_h <dig> on the myb-p box, we changed the sequence tcctacc by a triple mutation to taacacc  . a decrease of about 50% was observed for both ternary combinations. despite the critical role of the myb-p box, a Δpchs_h <dig> variant containing the myb-p box attached upstream of the tata box  was inactive, suggesting the dependence of pchs_h <dig> activation on the length and/or specific order in the promoter sequence.

substitution and complementation of activating complexes with selected h. lupulus- and a. thaliana-derived myb tfs
to investigate a possible functional complementation, related myb tfs from h. lupulus and a. thaliana were compared using the transient expression system. in addition to pchs_h <dig>  also the promoter pchs <dig> of the chalcone synthase-like gene from hop was analyzed. the gene for chs <dig> was cloned previously  by novák et al.  <cit> . the pchs <dig> sequence is  <dig> bp in length and has a different architecture in comparison to pchs_h <dig>  while still containing similar myb and bhlh boxes. using the place database it was possible to identify a mybpzm box core ccwacc   <cit>  at position - <dig> to - <dig>  a myb p-like box corresponding to the consensus sequence maccwamc  at position - <dig> to - <dig>  <cit>  and another potential myb1at box with the consensus sequence waacca  <cit>  at position - <dig> to - <dig> . one bhlh g-binding box  and one e-binding box   <cit>  were found at positions - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  respectively.

the relative activation levels for the individual tf combinations are shown in table  <dig>  it was observed that the pchs_h <dig> promoter is most strongly responding to the ternary combinations, whereas the strongest response of pchs <dig> was found for independent myb action or binary combinations. furthermore, a. thaliana-derived atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  clearly supplemented the m component in the ternary mbw combination, while atmyb <dig> did not cause any enhancement of activation in the mbw combination over the mb or mw combinations. atmyb <dig> also strongly activated pchs <dig> when applied alone or in the mw combination. atmyb <dig> and hlmyb <dig>  the strongest ternary activators of pchs_h <dig>  showed low capability to activate pchs <dig>  interestingly, a clear-cut difference was observed for the subvariants of hlmyb <dig>  <cit> . while l-hlmyb <dig> shows a maximum of activation for pchs <dig> in the mb combination, the maximum of activation of pchs_h <dig> was observed for the shorter variant s-hlmyb <dig> in the mbw combination. both hlmyb <dig> subvariants show a significant effect on both promoters in the mb combinations  which is even more pronounced for pchs <dig> . hlmyb <dig>  <cit>  appeared as the weakest activator of pchs_h <dig>  although still an induction of  <dig> ±  <dig> pmol gus/mg/min was observed for the mbw combination. finally, although hlmyb <dig> shows some similarity to the other investigated mybs , it is not an activator in any combination, neither for pchs_h <dig> nor for pchs <dig>

hlmyb <dig> is a suppressor of promoter activation
although hlmyb <dig> is related to the other investigated mybs, especially to atmyb <dig> and hlmyb <dig>  this hop-derived transcriptional regulator showed no ability to activate the hop chs promoters . as we identified a transcriptional suppressor motif pdlnlelris, in the c terminal region of hlmyb <dig>  the suppressive activity of hlmyb <dig> was investigated by assaying pchs_h <dig> activity in transient expression systems containing mbw × hlmyb <dig> combinations with hlmyb <dig>  s-hlmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  . the addition of hlmyb <dig> was found to significantly decrease the reference gus activity. a similar suppression by hlmyb <dig> in the range of  <dig> to 90% was observed for binary combinations, as well as for the independent action of individual myb genes on both chs promoters , suggesting a more wide suppressive activity of this myb. in order to analyze the possible role of the myb-p boxes in this inhibition, the p2chs_h <dig> construct  was used to analyze the influence of hlmyb <dig> to the promoter activity after co-infiltration with m2b2w <dig> × hlmyb <dig>  s-m3b2w <dig> × hlmyb <dig> and corresponding controls without hlmyb <dig>  as the suppressive activity was also found to reach about 50% , it is most likely that the myb-p box does not play a major role.

influence of cloned tfs on the accumulation of anthocyanins in the heterologous system of petunia hybrida leaves
the hop-derived tfs investigated in this study are all related to known transcription factors involved in regulation of flavonoid pathways. because of the significant activation of chs_h <dig> genes, the hop-derived tfs are expected to increase the pool of naringenin chalcone, whereby they may stimulate downstream anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation. in the lupulin glands, however, colored anthocyanins are not detectable as it is most likely that chalcone isomerase and further downstream enzymes of anthocyanin biosynthesis are not expressed. instead, lupulin glands accumulate prenylated chalcones and other terpenophenolics composing the highly specific lupulin metabolome  <cit> . on the other hand, accumulation of naringenin chalcone in p. hybrida may lead to accumulation of anthocyanins. to further investigate the specificity of the cloned hop tfs in different combinations, as well as their potential to activate anthocyanin pathway, a transient tf expression system in p. hybrida was used. for comparison, atpap <dig> was included as a regulator having the capability to co-activate the anthocyanin biosynthesis in petunia leaves providing co-expression of atpap <dig> and chs_h <dig> genes arranged in tandem  <cit> ). hence, atpap <dig> or/and hop chs_h <dig> activators, e.g., s-hlmyb <dig>  hlmyb <dig>  hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig>  in particular combinations were analyzed for possible anthocyanin induction.

it was shown that only the co-infiltration of the chs_h <dig> gene  with atpap <dig> and hlbhlh <dig> was found to strongly induce an accumulation of blue anthocyanins in the petunia leaves . this may be due to both an increased pool of chalcones and the activation of downstream anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. infiltration of either atpap <dig> or hlbhlh <dig> alone did not result in any detectable level of anthocyanins . based on retention times and uv-vis spectra, the profile of the induced leaf anthocyanin metabolites was found to be qualitatively very similar to the profile of anthocyanins found in the blue corolla tissue of petunia flowers. however, significant differences were found in quantitative composition. it is surprising that only minor amounts of anthocyanin metabolites were observed for the ternary combination atpap1b2w <dig> that led to dramatic activation of pchs_h <dig> as shown above . neither the combinations with hop-derived mybs, hlmyb <dig> or s-hlmyb <dig> that activated pchs_h <dig>  i.e., s-m3b <dig>  s-m3b2w <dig> nor m2b2w <dig> resulted in blue pigmentation in the petunia leaves. the metabolically highly active s-hlmyb <dig>  <cit> , caused yellow spots on the leaves in combination with hlbhlh <dig> . the hop tfs, hlmyb <dig>  s-hlmyb <dig> and wdr <dig> were not able to co-induce anthocyanin biosynthesis in petunia leaves.

discussion
sequences and functional properties of lupulin gland-associated transcription factors and their potential role as regulators of the biosynthesis of the lupulin metabolome
four new transcriptional regulators, i.e., hlmyb <dig>  hlmyb <dig>  hlbhlh <dig>  and hlwdr <dig>  were isolated and cloned from the czech hop variety, osvald's  <dig> in this study. all these tfs show a highly specific expression in the lupulin glands and display high similarity to established myb, bhlh and wdr tfs, that are known regulators of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in various plant species. some of these regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit>  form ternary mbw activation complexes like  in p. hybrida  <cit>  and  in a. thaliana  <cit>  as well as recently described tf complexes in peas  <cit>  and lotus japonicus  <cit> . mbw complexes have been described to regulate not only pigmentation, but also the fate of epidermal cells, including the initiation and further development of trichomes  <cit> . hop lupulin glands are glandular trichomes and, therefore, it was anticipated from the evolutionary point of view, that the combinatorial mbw machinery could be involved in the activation of genes related to the lupulin metabolome biosynthesis. using a combinatorial transient expression system, it was shown that a m2b2w <dig> combination synergistically induced a very strong activation of native chs_h <dig>  this gene is coding for a crucial hop "true" chalcone synthase endowed with the ability to produce naringenin chalcone with a high catalytical rate  <cit>  and, therefore, it is likely playing an important role in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the accumulation of prenylated chalcones in lupulin glands, including xanthohumol and desmethylxanthohumol   <cit> .

the newly isolated hlmyb <dig> shows a typical sequence motif lx2x3lx6lx3r within the r <dig> domain that is characteristic for a possible interaction with a member of the sub-group of iiif bhlhs  <cit> . this finding is in accordance with the ability of hlmyb <dig> to strongly activate pchs_h <dig> in a m2b2w <dig> combination using a combinatorial transient expression system. on the other hand, clear synergistic effects were also observed for subvariants of the polyfunctional hlmyb <dig> , although the bhlh-interacting motif is missing in its amino acid sequence. especially the shorter subvariant s-hlmyb <dig> resulted in a significant activation of the chs_h <dig> gene in both binary s-m3b <dig> and ternary s-m3b2w <dig> combinations. this suggests that hlbhlh <dig> is able to interact with s-hlmyb <dig> by either involving alternative hydrophobic residues in these positions exposed on the protein surface, or some alternative way. according to our unpublished results, electrophoretic mobility shift assay  showed some physical interaction between radioactively labeled pchs_h <dig> and proteins extracted from leaves infiltrated with s-m3b <dig> and s-m3b2w <dig> complexes. more experiments are necessary to clarify this interaction. the different length of the n-terminal domain of hlmyb <dig> has a crucial effect on its ability to activate pchs_h <dig> in m3b <dig> and m3b2w <dig> combinations, as practically no synergism was observed for the l-m3b2w <dig> combination. the divergent effects of overexpressed l- and s-hlmyb <dig> tfs was observed earlier as reflected by changes in the composition of metabolites in petunia leaves, as well as in changes of the morphogenesis of a. thaliana and p. hybrida transgenotes  <cit> . the functional analyses presented in table  <dig> confirmed the complementation of hop lupulin gland-specific mybs by selected a. thaliana mybs in various binary or ternary combinations, suggesting not only sequential but also functional similarity of these tfs. for instance, atpap <dig> in combination with hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig> resulted in a strong synergistic effect. interplay between pap <dig> and other components of mbw complexes in a. thaliana has been described previously  <cit> . in our experiments the highest synergism in the ternary mbw combination was also observed with atmyb <dig>  while the flavonoid regulator atmyb <dig> responded synergistically only to the binary bm and bw combinations, suggesting some specificity of protein:protein interactions among these tfs. in addition to r2r <dig> mybs, we confirmed the functional complementation of hlwdr <dig> by ttg <dig> from a. thaliana .

the newly cloned hlmyb <dig> appears to be a potential negative r2r3myb regulator of both chs_h <dig> and chs <dig> genes in hop as it showed significant suppressor activity in a transient expression system. this is consistent with the identification of a pdlnlelris sequence in the c-terminal part of this protein conforming to the consensus pdlnld/elxig/s sequence characteristic for subgroup  <dig> r2r3mybs  <cit> , which is conserved in repression region of the atmyb <dig> repressor  <cit> . the repression caused by hlmyb <dig> was found to be independent on the myb-p box positioned on the 5'region of pchs_h <dig>  but it remains to be established whether it exerts its repressive activity via an interaction with mbw components, other proteins or binding to other elements in the promoter sequence.

upregulation of chs_h <dig> genes by both s-m3b2w <dig> and m2b2w <dig> combinations may increase the pool of available naringenin chalcone-precursors for further production of lupulin prenylchalcones co-determined by expression of downstream hop genes including prenyltransferase  <cit> , and o-methyl transferase  <dig>  <cit> . while hop transformed by a single atpap <dig> gene was characterized by a significantly higher production of anthocyanins, rutin and isoquercetrin in cones and flowers in comparison to wild type plants  <cit> , anthocyanins were not accumulated in the lupulin glands  <cit> , most likely due to the lack of expression of the specific enzymatic machinery in these specialized structures. conversely, hop tfs in s-m3b2w <dig> and m2b2w <dig> combinations were unable to co-activate the anthocyanin pathway in p. hybrida as found for the atpap1b <dig> combination, thereby supporting the idea about functional specialization of lupulin-specific tfs. according to our unpublished results, neither the s-m3b2w <dig> nor the m2b2w <dig> combination was able to induce other promoters of hop genes like valerophenone synthase or the o-methyl transferase <dig>   <cit> , confirming its specificity for the chs_h <dig> gene.

neither the ternary combinations s-m3b2w <dig>  m2b2w <dig> nor the pchs_h1-activating s-m3b <dig>  m2b <dig> complexes were able to induce anthocyanin pigments in petunia leaves. the significantly elevated level of leaf metabolites and blue anthocyanins resulting from the atpap1b <dig> combination is probably due to an ability of atpap1b <dig> complex to activate also downstream genes in petunia, like chalcone isomerase , flavanone 3-hydroxylase , dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , and anthocyanidin synthase   <cit> . indeed, the metabolome and mrna screenings shown that the overexpression of the atpap <dig> gene is resulting in the activation of at least  <dig> petunia genes and also some new metabolites were produced  <cit> . thus, further investigations are required to clarify the profile of hop genes that may be up-regulated by combinatorial action of isolated hop tfs.

proposed regulation of hop chs genes as predicted from combinatorial analysis
to analyze the functional properties of the newly cloned hop tfs it was opted to use a combinatorial transient expression system because hop transformation  <cit>  and cultivation to reach flowering are very laborious and time-consuming especially for the investigation of the tfs in various combinations. while this transient expression assay is characterized by a negligible background signal i.e. signal originating from endogenous n. benthamiana tfs  <cit> , it enabled us to efficiently compare the activation of different promoter constructs by various combinations of hop tfs. a comparison of truncated promoter constructs revealed a major dependence of pchs_h <dig> activation by s-m3b2w <dig> and m2b2w <dig> combinations on a single myb-p box characteristic for binding the p <dig> tf of zea mays  <cit> . however, other binding boxes such as the myb-like box, the myb-p-related box, the myb iig-like box and the g-binding sites characteristic for bhlh g-box binders driving the flavonoid pathway  <cit>  also contribute to the overall activity. therefore, each component of the promoter seems to impact on the degree of activation and it is the integral composition of the promoter that dictates the involvement of particular tfs in specific combinations. this is apparent on a comparison of two chs promoters both driving chalcone synthases having high expression in lupulin glands, i.e., chs_h <dig> and chs <dig> . a proposed schematic overview of the interactions of the investigated tfs with the different promoters is shown in figure  <dig>  the two promoters having a different spatial composition of similar potential myb and bhlh binding boxes are activated differently by the same transcription factors. pchs_h <dig> is predominantly activated not only by m2b2w1/s-m3b2w <dig> ternary complexes, but also by b2w <dig> and mb binary combinations and by action of hlbhlh <dig> independent on hop b <dig> and w <dig> . single myb and mw binary combinations did not result in activation of pchs_h <dig>  this is in sharp contrast with pchs <dig>  where "direct activation" by hlmyb <dig> or the binary s-m3w <dig> combination is preferred . activation of pchs <dig> by the m2b2w <dig> ternary complex is negligible , as well as any combination including hlbhlh <dig> . interestingly, both promoters can be negatively regulated by the hlmyb <dig> repressor . the general dependence of the combinatorial action of tfs on the specific promoter composition is illustrated in many studies summarized in recent reviews  <cit> . although we did not observe any significant activation of pchs_h <dig> with n. benthamiana tfs, we cannot exclude some influence of endogenous n. benthamiana tfs on the combinatorial regulation of pchs_h <dig> in this heterologous system. further study will be conducted to confirm proposed regulation pattern. the specific co-regulation of the lupulin metabolome biosynthesis genes depends on the steady state levels of individual tfs forming the actual tf balance. it is, therefore, conceivable that misbalancing of such complexes like m2b2w <dig> by the downregulation of a specific tf complex component could lead to a significant decrease in gene expression and thus in the production of the lupulin metabolome. in support of this idea, it should be noticed that we recently detected a misbalanced expression of tfs in decolored petioles of diseased hop plants infected with hop stunt viroid  .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study new tf homologues corresponding to the plant r2r3myb, bhlh and wdr families were cloned using a cdna library derived from hop  lupulin gland tissue. the cloned hlmyb <dig> and - <dig>  hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig> tfs display a high similarity to known tfs regulating the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and were found to be highly specifically expressed in lupulin glands. the functional activity of these tfs was investigated using a combinatorial transient expression system in infiltrated leaf sectors of nicotiana benthamiana. these experiments provided new insight into the complexity of the regulation of chs_h <dig> genes, as well as into the differential activation of chs_h <dig> promoter and the lupulin-specific chalcone synthase  <dig> promoter. the regulation involves variations of ternary, binary and independent tfs action. complementation of hop and a. thaliana tfs was shown in particular combinations. the hop chs-activating tfs, hlmyb <dig> and  <dig>  hlbhlh <dig> and hlwdr <dig> in various combinations did not enable the induction of the anthocyanin pathway in p. hybrida suggesting the specialization of the mbw machinery in the specialized tissue of hop glandular trichomes. hlmyb <dig> was characterized as an r2r <dig> repressor that could act as a potential co-regulator of the lupulin metabolome biosynthesis.
