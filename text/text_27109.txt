BACKGROUND
as species, humans and horses are closely linked, not only because of their historical and cultural backgrounds, but also because they share a natural aptitude for athletic performance. this similarity has prompted some researchers to consider the horse a reference species for comparative studies in human exercise physiology; conversely, knowledge gained from human medicine frequently represents a starting point for research on veterinary exercise medicine  <cit> . this topic is of interest for both species, as evidenced by the number of studies that have reported on efforts to identify genes involved in the response to moderate activity and/or strenuous exercise  <cit> . these previous studies have provided evidence that oxidative stress during exercise is a physiological event that is common among exercising mammals.

recent years have seen an exponential increase in specific molecular information, opening new paths of knowledge and providing interesting results that could be used to optimize physical training and prevent diseases. in particular, studies on the endocrinology of exercise and training have demonstrated the existence of an integrated metabolic network involved in regulating hormones and cytokines  <cit> . among the components of this hormone-regulatory network is the pleiotropic cytokine, interleukin- <dig> , which modulates the function of immune cells in response to exercise and training, thereby playing a major role in the exercise-induced inflammatory process  <cit> .

strenuous, prolonged exercise induces an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α , and dramatically up-regulates the inflammation-responsive cytokine il- <dig>  this response is balanced by the release of cytokine inhibitors, such as il- <dig> receptor antagonist  and the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  <cit> . the effects of il- <dig> are believed to play a dominant role in this context. according to petersen and pederson  <cit> , il- <dig> exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inducing the release of il-1ra and il- <dig>  il- <dig> also inhibits tnf-α production both in vitro and in animal studies  <cit> . on the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that exercise exerts a protective, long-term anti-inflammatory effect  <cit> .

in trained horses, donovan and colleagues  <cit>  found a strong increase in il- <dig> mrna expression in leukocytes after acute exercise. in humans, il- <dig> gene expression after acute exercise has been reported to increase in monocytes  <cit>  or remain unchanged in peripheral blood mononuclear cells   <cit>  . il- <dig> mrna levels in human skeletal muscle is markedly increased by exercise, and contracting muscle appears to be the primary contributor to the exercise-induced increase in circulating levels of il- <dig>  <cit> .

the evidence that baseline il- <dig> plasma concentrations are affected by training is limited, and the results of such studies are often contradictory  <cit> , partly due to differences in experimental design, tissues studied and techniques used. in at least one study, expression of il- <dig> mrna in human muscle at rest did not change in response to training  <cit> .

il- <dig> exerts its action via a specific il- <dig> receptor . in response to physical training, basal il-6r mrna levels in skeletal muscle are increased, suggesting a sensitization of skeletal muscle to il- <dig> at rest  <cit> . to our knowledge, it is not known if enhanced il-6r expression following training also occurs in other tissues. in this regard, because anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> and il-1ra are mainly produced by il-6-stimulated macrophages, lymphocytes and monocytes  <cit> , the role of circulating immunocytes in controlling the inflammatory response to exercise remains crucial.

in a recent case-control study, it was shown that glucocorticoid receptor alpha  mrna levels in pbmcs at rest were much lower in highly trained athletes than in sedentary subjects, suggesting that training may induce an adaptive mechanism that modulates the sensitivity of the target tissue  <cit> . by extension, determining the resting state of il- <dig> and il-6r mrna expression in pbmcs of high-level athletes compared with lightly trained and sedentary subjects can be useful in understanding the modulation of il- <dig> in the adaptive response of circulating immunocytes to exercise training. hence, the aim of the present case-control study was to compare il- <dig> and il-6r mrna expression in pbmcs in highly trained, lightly trained and untrained male humans and in trained and untrained horses.

RESULTS
evaluation of the stability of selected housekeeping genes
humans
two different analytical procedures were used to test the reliability of selected control genes, both of which produced results that were highly similar overall. the genorm and normfinder algorithms were applied to analyze the expression data for the housekeeping genes  β-actin , glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase , cyclophilin b/peptidylprolyl isomerase b , and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase  <dig> , both independently for each of the tested groups and on all the data considered collectively . the results showed that gapdh was always the least stable control; thus, its use to normalize quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  experiments on human pbmcs samples should preferably be avoided. the remaining three hkgs  shared very similar behaviors , and were always classified among the first positions in the stability rankings produced by genorm and normfinder. specifically, hprt <dig> showed the best expression stability within each single group and was always identified as the optimal control gene in this context ; however, it exhibited greater variability in expression in the entire dataset , and was therefore classified as the third-best gene in the comprehensive analysis. actb and ppib showed very similar m-values  and sd-values , always occupying the second or third positions in the stability rankings. these are classified as the best pair of reference genes in the comprehensive analysis .

*denotes the two most stable genes that constitute a couple that cannot be further ranked . m values  and sd values  constitute different measures of the stability of gene expression across samples.

on the basis of the expression stability values collected in this study, an optimal normalization factor for qrt-pcr data could be calculated using the three most stable genes , and excluding the lowest-scoring gapdh.

horses
a previous study employing genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper algorithms  indicated that succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit  <dig>  and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase  were the best housekeeping genes from among a group of nine potential genes tested. mrna transcripts of these genes were used here to calculate an optimal normalization factor for qrt-pcr data.

differences in il- <dig> and il-6r mrna expression
il- <dig> mrna was up-regulated in highly trained subjects in both species. in contrast, il-6r was strongly induced by physical training in horses, but showed little change in response to training in humans.

the scatter plot displayed in figure 1a-b, which shows the correlation between il- <dig> and il-6r expression ratios for each of the individuals tested, clearly reveals the graphic separation of highly trained human athletes from other samples, mainly due to their higher levels of il- <dig> expression . it is also evident that lightly trained athlete- and sedentary-subject groups tended to overlap and were not significantly differentiated on the basis of changes in il- <dig> or il-6r expression. more evident is the separation within horses groups due to higher levels il- <dig> and il-6r expression in trained subjects . this trend in both humans and horses is also evidenced by the reduced standard error in the bar plot of figure 1c-d, which compares the relative expression of il- <dig> and il-6r across all groups.

the bar plot results presented in figure 1c and 1d demonstrate the statistical significance of il- <dig> over-expression in athletes compared with the other groups in both humans and horses, showing  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold inductions  for highly trained human athletes versus sedentary and lightly trained level athletes, respectively, and a  <dig> -fold induction  for athletic compared with sedentary horses. on the other hand, the slight il-6r induction in human athletes was not statistically significant, in contrast with the robust  and highly significant induction of il-6r in athletic horses compared with sedentary horses.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our results show the effect of high-level exercise training on the induction of the il- <dig> and il-6r genes in two species: homo sapiens and equus caballus. in humans, transcription of the il- <dig> gene is clearly higher in highly trained subjects, whereas the expression of il-6r does not differ significantly among the groups. in horses, both transcripts are significantly expressed at higher levels in athletic individuals.

cytokines modulate immune cell function and migration, initiating and amplifying the acute-phase and stress responses; the local production of these molecules coordinates the function of innate and adaptive immune cells  <cit> . in this context, it is widely presumed that il- <dig> could mediate the protective, long-term anti-inflammatory effects of exercise by orchestrating an anti-inflammatory reaction involving macrophages, lymphocytes and monocytes. in fact, il- <dig> stimulates the production of cytokine inhibitors  and anti-inflammatory cytokines  in these immunocytes  <cit> .

endurance races in humans  and in horses  have been shown to induce similar responses in both species  <cit> . after a marathon, there is a dramatic increase in il- <dig>  concomitant with an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-α  and il-1β . this is balanced by the release of cytokine inhibitor il-1ra  and the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> , which restrict the magnitude and duration of the inflammatory response to exercise. in horses, it has been reported that strenuous, long-duration exercise triggers a systemic pro-inflammatory response similar to the events that occur during sepsis, with increased levels of circulating cytokines il- <dig> , tnf-α  and il-1β   <cit> .

in humans, contracting muscle has been reported to contribute most of the circulating il- <dig> elaborated in response to endurance exercise  <cit> , whereas the main source of circulating il- <dig> after exercise in horses remains to be determined. in untrained men, connolly and colleagues  <cit>  found no global increase in the pbmc expression of il- <dig> mrna after  <dig> minutes of exercise. they did, however, note a significant parallel increase in the expression of il-1ra and il-6r in pbmcs after  <dig> hour of recovery from exercise. interestingly, the timing of this increase in the expression of both genes in pbmcs paralleled the increase in circulating levels of il-1ra  <cit> . an increase in the expression of il-1ra in pbmcs after exhaustive exercise was also found by buttner et al.  <cit>  in moderately trained students, and by zieker et al.  <cit>  in well-trained runners. in addition, it was recently shown that il-1ra gene variants are associated with athletic status  <cit> . however, rhind et al.  <cit>  reported that physical exercise triggers increased expression of il-1β, il-1ra, il- <dig> and tnf-α in human pbmcs, and showed that the intracellular up-regulation of inflammation-associated cytokines corresponded with increased serum concentrations. from these observations, the authors concluded that blood monocytes can serve as a source of circulating inflammatory cytokine production with exercise. the extremely fatiguing exercise regimen used by rhind and colleagues  <cit> , consisting of seven days of exhausting exercise, may have provided a stronger stimulus for monocyte activation, and thereby greater cytokine synthesis, compared with previous experiments. in addition, it has been reported that, in highly trained athletes, mononuclear cells appear to be chronically activated to spontaneously release il- <dig>  but have a decreased response to further stimulation  <cit> . consistent with a possible training-induced sensitization of pbmc to release il- <dig>  we found higher levels of il- <dig> mrna in the pbmcs of athletes than in untrained subjects, both in humans and horses.

il- <dig> exerts its action via il-6r, which exists both in a soluble  and a membrane-bound form. complexation of il- <dig> with its soluble receptor, in fact, increases the half-life of il- <dig> and allows signaling to occur in tissues devoid of il-6ra process termed trans-signaling. few studies  have addressed the effect of exercise on sil-6r levels and the findings are conflicting. an increase in sil-6r after exercise has been reported in sedentary middle-aged men  <cit>  and in endurance-trained cyclists  <cit> . however, it has also been reported that, after exercise, il- <dig> mrna expression in muscle increases while il-6r plasma protein remains unaffected, suggesting that il-6r production mainly serves a local role  <cit> .

exercise training could affect il- <dig> and il-6r expression, although few studies have addressed this question. in humans, the magnitude of exercise-induced il- <dig> mrna expression in skeletal muscle in untrained subjects was markedly reduced after  <dig> weeks of endurance training, whereas il- <dig> expression at rest did not change in response to training  <cit> . in horses, a light 8-week training program did not affect il- <dig> or il- <dig>  but did increase il-1ra mrna levels in circulating leukocytes  <cit> . it has been shown that exercise training increases basal levels of il-6r mrna in skeletal muscle. this increase in il-6r gene expression could support the metabolic actions of il- <dig> on skeletal muscle, suggesting that il- <dig> target tissues can be sensitized at rest to il- <dig> after a training period. the il-6r mrna response to exercise in humans, unlike that of il- <dig>  is not affected by training status or energy availability, and the factors that modulate il-6r induction have not been clearly identified  <cit> . however, it has been reported that, in human skeletal muscle, increases in cortisol and il- <dig> after exercise could play a role in exercise-induced il-6r expression  <cit> .

to our knowledge, whether enhanced il-6r expression following training also occurs in other tissues and in other species has not been established. in the present study, il-6r gene expression in pbmcs was found to be higher in endurance-trained athletic horses than in untrained subjects. up-regulation of il-6r expression in pbmcs in horses could reflect a mechanism to maintain an adequate anti-inflammatory environment at rest through ubiquitous production of anti-inflammatory cytokines throughout the body.

these results could be interpreted to mean that the system that controls the inflammatory response in horses is better adapted to respond to exercise than that in humans. further investigation into these differences should provide insight into what types and level of effort are required by these species to reach top condition and peak performance. however, the study design  limits the generalizability of the results. additional studies will be needed to establish if trained horses develop  stronger adaptation mechanisms capable of maintaining an anti-inflammatory body environment at rest.
