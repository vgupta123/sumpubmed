BACKGROUND
gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells  by conventional approaches is a cumbersome and inefficient process. the development of sequence-specific nucleases, such as talens, can, however, significantly enhance the efficiency of genome editing in hpscs  <cit> . talens are chimeric fusions between custom-designed transcription activator-like effectors  of xanthomonas plant pathogens and the foki nuclease  <cit> . within the tale structure, individual repeat domains confer specific recognition and binding to single nucleotides on dna. several types of repeat domains differing solely in their so-called repeat variable di-residues  have been found to be selective binders of individual dna bases, with differing affinities  <cit> . custom design of the modular tale repeat domain structure hence allows specific targeting and binding of tales to genomic regions of interest. upon presence and adjacent binding of two talens, a dna double-strand break  will be induced by the fused catalytic domain of foki nuclease, which is then repaired either by the error-prone mechanism of non-homologous end joining  or via homology-directed repair  <cit> . hence, in the absence of homologous template sequence, small genetic lesions may be introduced into a predefined locus by delivery of pairs of specifically designed talen constructs into cells, such as hpscs  <cit> .

several approaches have been used for the generation of custom talens  <cit> . these are, however, not easy to adopt for new researchers entering the field  <cit> . cermak et al. <cit>  have recently established a particularly straightforward talen assembly system that is based on goldengate cloning. it enables reliable talen assembly within a few days and has been made available through the addgene repository. however, the associated expression vectors were not optimized for applications in mammalian cells. we have therefore developed a new set of vectors compatible with this publicly available talen assembly kit  <cit> . our plasmids contain an improved talen backbone architecture incorporating findings by miller et al. <cit>  as well as selection cassettes to enrich for transfected cells. here, we report the application of the combined system to hpscs by creating isogenic knock-out models for the x-linked hprt <dig> locus at high efficiencies. mutations in this gene cause lesch-nyhan-syndrome , a disease with strong neurological symptoms  <cit> . clonal knock-out lines showed impaired differentiation into different neuronal lineages, recapitulating aspects of the disease phenotype in vitro. the combined talen assembly-and-expression system simplifies the custom generation of hpsc knock-out cell lines and will therefore be universally applicable for functional studies and the generation of hpsc-based disease models.

methods
cell culture
hpscs were cultivated on matrigel® in either mef-conditioned or defined ftda media  <cit> . hek-293 t cells were cultured on conventional tissue culture plastic in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin-streptomycin-l-glutamine.

talen design and assembly
tale repeat structures were designed using either the zifit targeter http://zifit.partners.org/zifit/) or the tal effector nucleotide targeter  <dig>  . talens were assembled as published  <cit> , by following the protocol associated with the goldengate talen and tal effector kit  <dig>  , except that tale repeats were ultimately cloned into vectors ptal7a  and ptal7b  .

pretesting of talens and generation of hprt <dig> knock-out lines
talens a and b were transfected into hek-293 t cells or hpscs at equimolar ratios using fugene  <dig> . starting from 24 hours after selection, antibiotic selection was applied for 48 hours with puromycin at  <dig>  μg/ml and blasticidin at 5 μg/ml. after selection, cells were dissociated and  lysed to purify genomic dna,  analyzed via flow cytometry, or  reseeded for selection of knock-out cells using 6-thioguanine . mutation frequencies were determined with the cel- <dig> assay  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 6-tg was applied for 4–8 days at a concentration of 30 μm.

neuronal differentiation
differentiation of hpscs into neurons was performed as previously described  <cit> . quantification of neurite length and percentage of beta-iii-tubulin-positive neurons was performed using arrayscan xti hca high-content imaging instrumentation .

RESULTS
in order to create a vector system compatible with the goldengate transcription-activator like effector nuclease  assembly kit  <cit>  and to enable efficient expression in mammalian cells, two additional expression plasmids – ptal7a and ptal7b – were generated. the main features of these vectors include  a cag promoter with a chimeric intron and a kozak sequence for efficient talen expression in mammalian cells,  esp3i  restriction sites for goldengate cloning,  a lacz fragment for blue/white-screening in e.coli,  an improved, truncated tale backbone architecture similar to the one established by miller et al.  <cit> , as well as  individual selection cassettes for enrichment of double-transfected cells. hence, ptal7a contains a constitutively expressed puromycin resistance gene linked to green fluorescent protein, whereas ptal7b contains a blasticidin resistance cassette . this is to enrich for double-transfected cells in hard-to-manipulate cell lines such as human pluripotent stem cells  – embryonic stem cells  and induced pluripotent stem cells  – employing transient administration of the two antibiotics following talen transfection.

to demonstrate the functionality of the combined system, we designed  <dig> pairs of talens targeting exon  <dig> of the hprt <dig> gene . hprt <dig> is located on the x chromosome and mutations in this gene cause lesch-nyhan-syndrome , a disease with strong neurological symptoms  <cit> . cells without functional hprt <dig> can be selected via 6-thioguanine, a guanine analogue that is metabolized by hprt <dig> and introduced into the dna, resulting in mutagenesis and cell death . robust expression of cloned talen and selection cassettes in mammalian cells was confirmed by qrt-pcr . talen constructs were once more transfected into 293 t cells, transiently incubated at 37°c and 30°c to also investigate effects of low-temperature incubation on non-homologous end joining -based mutation frequencies  <cit> . hprt <dig> pcrs on isolated genomic dna were denatured, reannealed, and subjected to cel- <dig> digestion and gel electrophoresis to reveal the generation of small genetic lesions in these bulk cultures. specificity of dna-binding of talens is mediated by two amino acids in each of the individual repeat domains, the so-called repeat variable di-residue . several rvds have been found to bind with different affinities to their target nucleotide  <cit> . using talens employing only the “nk” rvd for targeting guanine did not produce detectable cel- <dig> digestion fragments . however, replacing “nk” by “nn” rvds at strategic positions, as previously suggested  <cit> , revealed that all three tested talens were functional as their delivery into 293 t cells apparently caused robust introduction of small lesions in hprt <dig> . a transient cold-shock at 30°c did not have a significant effect on induction of double-strand breaks  . functional selection of hprt <dig> mutant cells using the 6-tg confirmed these results in that all three talens produced 6-tg resistant cells, at varying efficiencies . sequencing of pcr clones from these 6-tg selected cultures showed that talen delivery mostly resulted in small deletions, implying that resulting frame shifts were the causes of disrupting hprt <dig> function .

we then asked if it was possible to pre-test talen pairs directly in hescs. indeed, the results were similar in that talen pair # <dig> appeared to cut its target site most efficiently, albeit the obtained cel- <dig> signals were somewhat weaker than in 293 t cells . 6-tg selection functionally confirmed the disruption of the hprt <dig> gene in hescs as numerous resistant colonies appeared with two out of three talen pairs tested . analysis of the mutational spectrum in hescs by sequencing of pcr clones revealed that mostly deletions as well as few insertions had been introduced by talen delivery, like in 293 t cells .

to ask if the ptal <dig> vectors indeed present an improvement over the existing platform using mammalian cells, the same talen pair # <dig> was employed both in the context of the original ptal <dig> and the new ptal <dig> expression vectors. both in 293 t cells and hescs, we failed to detect any evidence for error-prone nhej with the ptal <dig> vectors . selection with 6-tg functionally confirmed these results . furthermore, we asked if the performance of our expression vectors could be further improved by replacing wild-type foki nuclease domain by the sharkey variant which was previously reported to increase dsb formation  <cit> . however, with the present system, sharkey foki did not yield higher numbers of 6-tg resistant cells . despite this fact, these data suggest that the ptal <dig> vectors enable robust targeted mutagenesis compared to the original system.

next, we sought to quantify mutation frequencies in hescs by determining the ratio of surviving 6-tg resistant hesc colony numbers by the total number of colonies emerging in the absence of 6-tg. using pre-selection of double-transfected hescs by puromycin and blasticidin, functional hprt <dig> mutations were introduced in approximately 15% of cells. mutation rates without pre-selection were low , reflecting the usefulness of these resistance cassettes in the ptal <dig> vectors .

in order to test the applicability of our system to loci other than hprt <dig>  we employed talens targeting the oct <dig> <cit>  as well as the foxc <dig> locus. transfection into hescs and subsequent analysis showed robust induction of error-prone nhej in both these genes . moreover, to demonstrate that clonal knock-out hesc lines could be isolated without the option of functional negative selection , randomly picked colonies emerging after hprt <dig> talen transfection were expanded and screened for genomic lesions. mutant clone screening was in this case performed based on potential disruption of a restriction enzyme recognition site within the talen targeting region. of the  <dig> clones analyzed,  <dig> showed an undigested pcr band  suggesting at least heterozygous mutations. we further analyzed these clones using 6-tg as well as sequencing of the hprt <dig> locus. one clone showed small deletions in both alleles and was subsequently functionally confirmed to be 6-tg resistant . these data demonstrate the universal applicability of the combined goldengate/ptal <dig> talen system for generating knock-out hesc lines without the need for additional gene targeting vectors or negative selection procedures.

we next sought to demonstrate the usefulness of the system in the context of human disease modeling. to this end,  <dig> additional 6-tg resistant hues <dig> hesc clones were expanded and sequenced. all  <dig> clones had mutations in both hprt <dig> alleles, with  <dig> clones being homozygous and  <dig> heterozygous , suggesting a loss of x chromosome inactivation in all  <dig> clones  <cit> . conversely, performing the same experiment with low-passage female hipscs that presumably have not undergone loss of x inactivation  <cit>  produced 6-tg resistant clones with both homo- and heterozygous hprt lesions . to rule out that loss of one x-chromosome was the reason for detecting only one specific mutation in three of the hesc mutant clones, qpcr using an x-linked marker verified that all clones had retained both x-chromosomes . furthermore, no traces of the vector sequences were detectable by genomic pcr in these clones , suggesting that transient antibiotic selection did not favor integration of the ptal <dig> vectors. in order to investigate putative off-target cleavage of hprt <dig> talens, five putative off-target loci were screened for unwanted mutation events in the five clonal hprt <dig> knock-out cell lines. off-target effects were detected in none of these sites .

in order to investigate whether neurons derived from hprt <dig> mutant cell lines recapitulated disease phenotypes in vitro, as recently shown in case of patient-specific lesch-nyhan syndrome  hipscs  <cit> , wild-type and mutant cell lines were differentiated into central nervous system  neurons. compared to isogenic parental control cells, all  <dig> knock-out clones appeared to show impaired neuronal differentiation, based on immunofluorescence analysis . quantitative analysis of these differentiated cultures revealed a reduced overall number of neurons together with a strong decrease in average neurite length . to see if a phenotype could also be assigned to neurons of the peripheral nervous system, we also conducted differentiation into sensory-like neurons  <cit> . indeed, quantification of the average neurite length of brn3a-postive neurons growing out from plated embryoid bodies revealed a similar phenotype with significantly shorter neurites in hprt1-targeted cells . to investigate if this relatively mild phenotype in sensory-like neurons could also be observed with independent cell lines, we generated hprt <dig> knock-out clones from induced pluripotent stem cells, in the same manner as described above for hescs. parental hipscs and five independent mutant clones were once more differentiated into brn3a-positive neurons, to quantify resulting average neurite lengths. again, loss of functional hprt <dig> resulted in significantly shorter neurites  in the mutant clones as compared to parental controls. taken together, these data demonstrate the applicability of the combined talen system to genetic disease modeling based on isogenic pairs of mutant and wild-type hpsc lines.

discussion
talens have become a valuable tool for genome editing in a variety of cell types, including hpscs  <cit> . over the past few years, various methods to assemble talens have been developed, ranging from gene synthesis to manual cloning kits and automated high-throughput systems  <cit> . the goldengate talen assembly kit by cermak et al. is publicly available, straightforward to establish in the laboratory, reliable, as well as time and cost-efficient  <cit> . however, the final expression vectors of this kit were not optimized for application in mammalian cells. furthermore, modifications of the talen domain architecture shown to improve dsb induction  <cit>  were not included in the expression vectors. the ptal <dig> vectors described here are fully compatible with the goldengate talen kit  <cit> , yet overcome these drawbacks. they enabled robust induction of dsbs in human cell lines, including hpscs, resulting in functional gene knock-out without the need of conventional targeting vectors. the selection cassettes implemented in the plasmids enable enrichment of double-transfected cells, which proved to be key for obtaining high mutation frequencies in our hands. pre-selection for double transfectants will particularly be necessary in cases where negative functional selection as in case with hprt1/6-tg is not an option. indeed, we demonstrate that the ptal <dig> vectors permitted the isolation of hpsc knock-out lines without applying 6-tg selection, based solely on random picking of clones. in comparison with enrichment methods relying on fluorescent marker proteins  <cit> , the ptal <dig> system offers both antibiotic and fluorescent selection of transfected cells, making it highly versatile and independent of the availability of cell sorting instrumentation. furthermore, conventional lipofection as a delivery method yielded sufficient numbers of clones with small amounts of starting cells, in contrast to methods based on electroporation  <cit> .

the disease phenotypes observed in hprt <dig> knock-out cell-derived cns neurons recapitulated aspects of impaired neurogenesis in lns patients and were in line with observations made with patient-specific hipscs, albeit showing an overall higher number of differentiated neurons in our hands  <cit> . these differences may be explained with differences among individual hpsc lines, supporting the necessity of isogenic disease models. future experiments could address the effects of hprt <dig> knock-out on neuronal differentiation side-by-side in engineered hescs and patent-specific hipscs. in addition, impaired neurite outgrowth was also observed in brn3a-positive neurons  <cit> , extending these findings to the pns system. notably, these phenotypes were observed in independent clones of independent cell lines  and in comparison to isogenic parental controls, which demonstrates a causative role of mutant hprt <dig> irrespective of the genetic background. it would be worthwhile further investigating this effect on sensory-like neurons to study functional links to lns phenotypes. taken together, the observed cellular phenotypes confirm that talen-mediated mutagenesis in wild-type hpscs is a valid alternative for disease modeling without the need for patient material and lengthy reprogramming as well as hipsc characterization procedures  <cit> . introduction of more subtle lesions or gene correction approaches would be enabled by employing conventional gene targeting vectors in addition to the talen constructs  <cit> . furthermore, the system is not limited to using hpscs, as we have also successfully used it in hek-293 t, hela, and mouse es cells .

the field of targeted genetic engineering is rapidly evolving. for example, rna-protein-mediated dsb induction by the crispr-cas <dig> system has recently been shown to efficiently enhance gene targeting in a variety of organisms and cell types, including hpscs, similar to talens  <cit> . however, comprehensive studies addressing target specificity of this new platform are yet to be carried out, with regards to the shorter binding sequence of crisprs compared to talens as well as regarding the tolerance of single-base mismatches in the recognition sequence. likely, future investigation will be based on several well-working genetic engineering systems that may be selectively employed depending on their respective strengths and weaknesses.

CONCLUSIONS
the improved talen system evaluated in this work presents an affordable and easy-to-adopt methodology to facilitate gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells and other mammalian cell types. it will thus be helpful for developmental studies as well as disease modeling approaches.
