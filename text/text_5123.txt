BACKGROUND
infectious bronchitis  is a highly contagious viral disease of chickens. ibv frequently changes its genotype and antigenic properties, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and eventually the course of the disease  <cit> . due to the high level of antigenic variation among circulating viruses, establishing an effective vaccination schedule against ib has been difficult  <cit> . on the other hand, simultaneous or alternate use of ma <dig> and 4/ <dig>  as commonly employed in the eu, induces high levels of protection against heterologous ibv types such as d <dig> or qx. it has been demonstrated that this protocol doesn’t influence the development of protection against homologous ibvs while inducing high protection against heterologous ibv types such as d <dig> or qx  <cit> .

after ib vaccination and infection, systemic and upper respiratory tract , humoral and cell-mediated immunity , are stimulated. ibv are highly immunogenic and stimulate production of antibodies which can be detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , serum neutralisation  or haemaglutination inhibition  test  <cit> . although, humoral immunity can’t be considered a direct correlate of upper respiratory tract protection against ib, since the level of igs in tears were not in correlation with the resistance to respiratory challenge, specific antibodies inhibit ibv replication in structures other than urt .

systemic cmi is considered as a decisive factor in protection against ib. activation of cytotoxic cells correlated with lung and kidney ibv clearance  <cit> . pei et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that cd8+t cells isolated from spleens of birds, that recovered from ib and used for immunological transfer to naive chicks were capable of alleviating ib clinical course.

little is known about the role of urt immunity in the protection against ibv. several investigations indicated the role of innate immunity in the urt in the course of ib. those mechanisms are not able to cure the infection, but they limit ibv replication and initiate specific immunity stimulation . cd8+ t cells, capable of eliminating virus-infected cells, are mainly involved in the early stages of ib  <cit>  while cd4+ t cells and b lymphocytes are involved in later stages of specific immunity development  <cit> .

considering the above, our own research was carried out in order to determine the development of urt and systemic, cell-mediated and humoral immunity following simultaneous immunization with the heterologous ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> ibv strains in commercial broiler chickens vaccinated at hatch day.

methods
the experimental procedures and animal handling procedures were conducted with the approval of the local ethics committee for animal experiments in olsztyn, poland .

birds and vaccines
experiments were conducted on  <dig> 1-day old ross  <dig> broiler chickens purchased from a commercial hatchery. chickens were vaccinated in-ovo against marek’s disease with bivalent  vaccine. no additional vaccinations were performed at the hatchery. on day one blood samples and tracheal washings  were collected from  <dig> randomly selected birds in order to establish the level of anti-ibv maternally derived antibodies . the rest of the birds were divided into  <dig> group  as follows: control was the group that was not vaccinated against ib, ma <dig> was the group vaccinated against ib at 1st day of life  with the use of ma <dig> strain, 4/ <dig> group was vaccinated at 1st dol with 4/ <dig> strain and v <dig> group was vaccinated at 1st dol with both ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> strain in one diluent . vaccination protocol was identical to the one described previously by cook et al.  <cit>  who  vaccinated spf chickens with ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> strains at 1st dol. all vaccines were prepared according to manufacturer instructions  and the birds were vaccinated oculo-nasally in a dose recommended by the manufacturer. control group received sterile vaccine diluent at 1st dol oculo-nasally.

birds were raised till  <dig> dol in isolated units maintained at pcl  <dig>  facility. water and feed were given to birds ad libitum.

experimental design
birds were raised till  <dig> dol and during that period following samples were collected from birds of all of the experimental groups for laboratory evaluation. on  <dig>   <dig> and 14 days post vaccination   <dig> samples of hgs  and  <dig> spleen samples  were collected for flow cytometry analysis of relative  or absolute  counts of cd4+ and cd8+ t as well as bu1a+ b cells. twenty three blood samples were collected at  <dig> and  <dig> dpv for serological evaluation of anti-ibv igy in the serum. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpv  <dig> samples of tracheal washings were collected for serological evaluation of specific anti-ibv igy and iga levels. tracheal washings were collected by passing 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline  through the lumen of the trachea with a 2 ml syringe. the trachea was massaged gently to intensify the washing effect. tw and serum samples were stored at −20 °c until further analysis. additionally,  <dig> serum samples reacting positive in elisa at  <dig> dpv were subjected for hi analysis of cross-reactivity with different ibv diagnostic strains. experimental design is summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig> experimental design—sampling time point

on different dpv, samples were collected simultaneously from all of the experimental groups


a <dig> dpv  <dig> serum samples reacting possitive in elisa were subjected for hi evaluation




flow cytometry
isolation of mononuclear cells from hgs and spleens were performed as described previously  <cit> . hg and spleen samples  were homogenized in a manual dounce tissue grinder and filtered . cells pellets, obtained after centrifugation , were resuspended in 3 ml of 40% percoll density gradient and gently layered on 3 ml of 60% percoll. mononuclear cells were collected from the interphase after density centrifugation . finally, the obtained mononuclear cells were resuspended in 1 ml of pbs. vi-cell xr  cell counter and cell viability analyzer was used for each sample to calculate the absolute lymphocyte counts  per ml.

half million  or  <dig> ×  <dig>  of viable mononuclear cells were stained  with monoclonal mouse anti-chicken cd <dig> fitc  and mouse anti-chicken cd <dig> rpe  or mouse anti-chicken bu1a fitc  antibodies , incubated for 30 min on ice, washed twice in pbs and analyzed with the facscanto ii  flow cytometer.

further steps of flow cytometry data acquisition and dual platform analysis allowing the calculation of cd4+ and cd8+ t and bu1a+ b rcc in the spleen and cd4+, cd8+ t and bu1a+ b acc in hg samples were performed as described previously  <cit> . acc of t and b cells for hg samples were calculated with the use of the following formula: acc = /100%. data were expressed as mean rcc  or acc  of different t or b cell subpopulations +/− sd.

elisa
elisa evaluation was performed with the use of commercial ibv elisa kit  according to manufacturer recommendation with minor modifications. serum samples collected from birds  <dig> and  <dig> dpv were diluted 1: <dig>  in order to increase low antibody level detection. tw were tested undiluted and the level of specific iga in tw was detected as described previously  <cit>  with minor modifications. anti-ibv iga antibodies were detected by replacing the conjugated antibodies of elisa kit with goat anti-chicken iga hrp antibodies  dilluted 1: <dig>  <dig>  the following steps of elisa procedure were performed with eppendorf epmotion  <dig> lh automated pipetting station , biotek elx <dig> automatic plate washer  and biotek elx <dig> plate reader. based on sample ods the sample to positive -ratios were calculated and used to express the mean serum and tw anti-ibv antibody -ratio +/− sd per group and day post vaccination. mean od values +/− sd per group and day post vaccination were used to express the level of anti-ibv iga antibodies in tw.

hi test
hi test was performed with m <dig>  793b, d <dig>  italy o <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> ha antigens obtained from gd animal health service . the hi test was conducted according to standard procedure  using  <dig> ha units of antigen per well. the result of hi analyzes are express as mean hi antibody titer  +/− sd.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis of flow cytometry results was performed with graphpad prism  <dig>  with the use of student t - test. differences were considered statistically significant if p <  <dig>  and highly significant if p <  <dig> . statistical analysis of serological evaluation  results was performed with statistica pl v. <dig> with the use of nonparametric kruskal-wallis test. differences were considered statistically significant if p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
at the beginning of the experiment chicks had high anti-ibv mda levels both in serum  and tw  and the level of these antibodies declined gradually in the control group . mda have been demonstrated to interfere with immune response after ib vaccination. for example, terregino et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that commercial chickens vaccinated against ib with the use of ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> strains  developed lower titers of hi antibodies in comparison with spf birds. nevertheless, in this trial, both spf and commercial chickens had significantly increased hi antibody titers in comparison with the adequate control groups. additionally, chhabra et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that mda do not influence the production of iga in urt after vaccination  of day old commercial broiler chickens. in this experiment infiltration of different subpopulations of t and b cells in the urt was also unaltered and consistent with spf birds. overall, it seems that maternal immunity, to some extent, may neutralize the vaccine virus  but the general outcome of immune system stimulation after ib vaccination is unaltered by the mda.

both ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> vaccine strains belong to a different, antigenically distinct serotypes. ma <dig> is based on the massachusetts  serotype and the 4/ <dig> strain belongs to 4/ <dig> serotype. wild-types of those viruses are known for their different tissue tropism, pathogenicity and most importantly antigenic structure. ibv serotyping is done based on the s <dig> protein amino acid sequence analysis. the basic hypothesis of protectotype vaccination strategy, presented by cook et al.  <cit> , was that - new ibv serotypes can arise as a result of only a very few changes in the amino acid composition of the s <dig> part of ibv spike protein. on the other hand remaining part of the virus antigen uniform remains unchanged. those shared antigens can induce cross protective immunity against heterologous viruses. as it turned out, the combination of ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> vaccine strains for vaccination of chickens resulted in greater cross protection against heterologous ib viruses in comparison to monovalent vaccination with either ma <dig> or 4/ <dig> strain  <cit> . however, up to date, the underlying immune mechanism that could explain the efficacy of this protocol is unknown.

cellular immune response
considering the fact that cmi associated mainly with cytotoxic t cells is protective against ibv we have performed flow cytometry analysis of both urt and systemic cellular immune response after different ib vaccination protocols.

ma <dig> group
in the ma <dig> group statistically significant increase of cd4+ and cd8+ t acc in hg was recorded  <dig> and  <dig> dpv . additionally, in the ma <dig> group significant or highly significant increase of bu1a+ b acc in hg was recorded  <dig> and  <dig> dpv  respectively in comparison to the control group.fig.  <dig> mean cd4+  and cd8+  t and bu1a+ b  acc +/− sd in hg samples in different groups and day post vaccination. * significant differences at different dpv  in comparison to the control group. ** significant differences at different dpv  in comparison to the control group




statistically significant decrease of cd4+ t rcc was recorded in the spleen  <dig> dpv  in the ma <dig> group. additionally in this group, significant increase of cd8+ t rcc  in the spleen was recorded  <dig> dpv in comparison to the control group.fig.  <dig> mean cd4+  and cd8+  t and bu1a+ b  rcc +/− sd in spleen samples in different groups and day post vaccination. * significant differences at different dpv  in comparison to the control group. ** significant differences at different dpv  in comparison to the control group




4/ <dig> group
in 4/ <dig> group statistically significant increase of cd4+ t acc was recorded  <dig> dpv in hg . in this group we’ve recorded a significant increase of bu1a+ b acc in hg  <dig> and  <dig> dpv  in comparison to the control group.

significant increase of cd4+ t rcc in the spleen was recorded  <dig> dpv in 4/ <dig> group . in this group we’ve recorded a significant and highly significant increase of bu1a+ b rcc,  <dig> and  <dig> dpv , in comparison to the control group.

v <dig> group
in v <dig> group a highly significant increase of both cd4+ t and cd8+ t acc as well as bu1a+ b acc in hg was recorded  <dig> dpv .

in v <dig> group a highly significant increase of cd8+ t rcc in the spleen was recorded  <dig> dpv . additionally, in this group a significant increase of bu1a+ b rcc was recorded  <dig> dpv in spleen .

from presented data it turns out that the fastest stimulation of cmi parameters  in hg was recorded in ma <dig> group. despite the delayed character of this stimulation the highest infiltration of immunocompetent cells in urt was recorded  <dig> dpv in v <dig> group. unfortunately, we did not perform further analyzes to determine the actual level of lymphocytes stimulation but if we consider time dependencies of cd <dig> marker expression we may distinguish early and late cmi stimulation. and while early, probably associated mainly with the activation of nk cells, was most prominently stimulated in ma <dig> group, the late stimulation connected with cytotoxic lymphocytes activity was strongest in v <dig> group.

the results of our study corroborates previous findings of chhabra et al.  <cit>  who demonstrated that cd4+ and cd8+ cells infiltration in the urt takes place in first 2 weeks after ib vaccination of day old broiler chickens and that the overall number of infiltrating cd8+ cells is greater in comparison to the number cd4+ cells. additionally, cited authors demonstrated that broilers with higher number of infiltrating cd8+ cells in the urt  developed greater protection against ibv challenge.

considering time dependencies between cd4+ t cells and b cells contribution in hg we may speculate that mainly th <dig> subpopulation  of t helper cells was stimulated after ib vaccination.

similar time dependencies between cd4+ t cells and b cells was also recorded in the spleens of vaccinated birds. the strongest stimulation of those parameters was recorded in 4/ <dig> group but also v <dig> which may have influenced the results of hi test which will be discussed later.

the contribution of t cd8+ cells in the spleen increased in all of the ib vaccinated groups , but the strongest stimulation of this parameter was recorded in v <dig> group. pei et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that cd8+ t cells isolated from spleens of birds, that recovered from ib and used for immunological transfer to naive chicks were capable of alleviating ib clinical course.

humoral immune response
a statistically significant increase of serum igy level was recorded in all of the vaccinated group   <dig> dpv while the highest mean level of anti-ibv igy was recorded, at this time, in v <dig> group .fig.  <dig> mean igy serum level , igy tw level  and iga tw level  in different groups and day post vaccination. * significant differences at different dpv  in comparison to the control group




similarly, a statistically significant increase of mean tw igy level was recorded in all of the vaccinated group   <dig> and  <dig> dpv, while the highest mean level of anti-ibv igy  <dig> dpv was recorded in ma <dig> group .

in ma <dig> group a significant increase of specific iga mean levels was recorded  <dig> and  <dig> dpv . in comparison, in 4/ <dig> and v <dig> group an increase anti-ibv iga in tw was recorded  <dig> and  <dig> dpv while the highest mean level of anti-ibv iga  <dig> dpv was recorded in v <dig> group .

okino et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a gradual increase of specific iga and igg in the urt washings with simultaneous activation of cmi parameters in the urt after single full-dose vaccination of newly hatched chicks with h- <dig> ibv strain. in addition, these humoral and cmi response evaluated at mucosal sites correlated significantly with tracheal protection against homologous ibv challenge. additionally, our findings demonstrate that there are different patterns of iga levels in tracheal washes after different ib vaccination protocol application, which indicates that 4/ <dig> strain alone or in combination with ma <dig> strain  generates longer lasting and higher iga levels in tw.

hi test results are summarized in table  <dig>  in ma <dig> group no statistical differences was recorded in mean hi antibody titer against any of the homologous or heterologous ibv strains in comparison to the control group. in 4/ <dig> group a statistically significant increase of mean hi antibody titer against  <dig> out of  <dig> ibv strains  was recorded while in two cases  it was also significantly higher in comparison to ma <dig> group. in v <dig> group a statistically significant increase of mean hi antibody titer against d <dig> ibv strain was recorded in comparison to the control group.table  <dig> infectious bronchitis hi mean antibody titre  +/− sd,  <dig> dpv

CONCLUSIONS
it has been demonstrated previously that ma5 + 4/ <dig> ib vaccination protocol doesn’t influence the development of protection against homologous ibv strains  while inducing high protection against heterologous ibv types  <cit> . although 14 days interval between ma <dig>  and 4/ <dig>  vaccination protocol results in even better protection  than ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> vaccines given to birds simultaneously at  <dig> dol  <cit> , we’ve decided to use this protocol in order to:  uniform birds’ age within the experimental groups and to  imitate the widespread use of this protocol under field conditions. it has been demonstrated that both vaccination protocols  generates comparable protection against experimental infection with either homo- or heterologous ibv serotype and in both cases the level of protection was greater and wider against heterologous ibv strains in comparison to ma <dig> or 4/ <dig> alone vaccination protocol  <cit> .

the aim of our study was to evaluate the immune mechanisms that could explain the efficiency of ma5 + 4/ <dig> vaccination protocol. from our research it seems that this protocol combines the benefits of monovalent vaccination with either ma <dig> or 4/ <dig>  both of those strains are immunogenic, but while ma <dig> alone seems to stimulate cmi  more efficiently the 4/ <dig> strain generates a wider spectrum of immune system cross-reactivity and higher urt iga production. eventually, the final answer could be that this efficiency results from additive impact of ma <dig> and 4/ <dig> strains on different levels of both innate and acquired host immune response.
