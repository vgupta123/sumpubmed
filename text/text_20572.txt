BACKGROUND
there have been only a few reports about the enzymatic characterization and the change of the enzymatic properties of shmt by protein engineering  <cit> . currently, l-serine production mainly relies on enzymatic conversion from glycine precursor plus a c <dig> compound  <cit> , and the key enzyme in l-serine enzymatic conversion is shmt. the shmt is coded by the glya genes and act as the first enzyme in the assimilation of c <dig> compounds through the addition of formaldehyde to glycine, producing the principal intermediate in the pathway, serine  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to obtain a shmt with high activity of some new microorganisms and improve the catalytic efficiency through in vitro directed evolution.

shmt , a member of the α-class of pyridoxal phosphate enzymes, catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine, changes the chemical bonding at the cα-cβ bond of the serine side-chain mediated by the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor  <cit> . the crystal structures of shmt from the human and rabbit confirm that shmt belongs to the α-family of enzymes and shares a similar tertiary fold and mechanism  <cit> . shmt is ubiquitous, highly conserved plp-dependent enzyme with tetrahydrofolate  as the c <dig> acceptor  <cit> , purified from the animals  <cit> , plants  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . shmt is widely used in the synthesis of the serine using glycine and formaldehyde, while the activity of the wild-type is not sufficient for industrial production  <cit> .

the degenerate oligonucleotide-primed pcr  has been applied to the characterization of abnormal chromosomes and also in the cloning of new markers for specific chromosome regions  <cit> . based on unknown genome information circumstances, using dop-pcr to obtain glya  can overcome the shortcomings of existing methods, such as cdna library  <cit> , southern-blot hybridization  <cit> , direct pcr amplification according to the known genome information  <cit> , and shotgun technology  <cit> , for their waste time and material under the same conditions. protein engineers redesign proteins in order to improve their biomedical or industrial utility  <cit> . although the crystal structures of shmt from the human, rabbit and escherichia coli  are reported, little is known at present about the structure-function relationship among these enzymes  <cit> . and the exact active-site residues have never been confirmed using kinetic analyses of the wild-type and variant enzymes. structure-based site-directed mutagenesis is usually applied to produce variants with dramatically improved specificities and the residues in or near the active site tend to be chosen as their special roles in the activity of the enzymes  <cit> .

the objectives of the current study were to  clone the glya gene from arthrobacter nicotianae  using degenerate primers,  study characteristics of recombinant shmt by isolating the enzyme with high activity and  improve its catalytic efficiency by site-directed mutagenesis.

RESULTS
cloning of glya gene
using degenerate primers, a fragment was obtained by dop-pcr with the genomic dna of a. nicotianae as the template. the open reading frame  of the glya  fragment encoded a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids, with a deduced molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the phylogenetic analyses of the shmt sequences produced a tree to further verify the evolutionary relationship among anshmt and other known shmts, indicating that the anshmt shared  <dig> % amino acid identity with the known shmt from e. coli .figure  <dig>

discussion
the taxonomy of the bacterium a. nicotianae  was studied in  <dig>  <cit> . while no paper on the characterization of the shmt from arthrobacter was reported. the full-length of the glya gene from a. nicotianae was obtained by dop-pcr  <cit>  with moderate modifications, which represents a rapid, efficient, and species-independent technique for general dna amplification. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of this technique to clone the glya gene, suggesting that its potential application in the cloning of other glya genes. the glya encoding a novel shmt shared  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % similarities to the known enzymes from e. coli, h. methylovorum gm <dig>  c. jejuni, b. japonicum, and rabbit liver mitochondria, respectively.

currently, l-serine is mainly produced through cellular or enzymatic conversion from the precursor glycine plus a c <dig> compound, in which shmt is the key enzyme  <cit> . e. coli shmt forms a tight homodimer similar to that of aat and other α-plp enzymes, with the active site at the interface of the two monomers  <cit> . directed evolution is a technique that can overcome the limitations of natural enzymes used as biocatalysts, for this technique does not only rely on a detailed understanding of the relationship between enzyme structure and function, but on the simple powerful darwinian principles of mutation and selection  <cit> . by targeting mutations to certain amino acids, we can map the enzyme active site, investigate mechanisms, and study structure-function relationships  <cit> . the site-directed mutagenesis methods are usually used to generate cloned dnas with modified sequences to examine the importance of specific residues in the protein structure and function  <cit> . therefore, studying the shmt enzymatic properties and improving the catalytic efficiency can be available for insight into the industrial production of l-serine and further research.

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the characterization of the shmt which comes from arthrobacter. unlike hyphomicrobium methylovorum’s shmt   <cit> , the anshmt exhibited the highest activity at 40°c in the assays of the enzymatic characteristics, and retained 84% and  <dig> % of the maximal activity at 35°c and 45°c, respectively, and less than 40% of the activity after 1 h pre-treatment at 35°c and 45°c. without any stabilizer, the anshmt displayed higher ph stability profiles  than that from hyphomicrobium methylovorum  under alkaline environment. the i249l-shmt showed nearly no loss in activity after 24 h incubation under ph  <dig> , while the anshmt retained about 85% of the maximum activity. the anshmt was not affected by edta, indicating that the metal ions were not appropriate to the enzyme. additionally, the loss of activity of the enzyme in the presence of hg2+ might be attributed to the interaction with thiol groups of cys residue, dry residue, or carboxyl group of amino acid  <cit> .

the replacement of isoleucine with leucine at the  <dig> position resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase of the catalytic efficiency  in the mutant i249l over the wide type, namely a 7% increase in km and a  <dig> -fold increase in kcat indicating that the  <dig> site is vital to improve the enzyme activity. the increase of the 7% for the km may be due to the decreased of enzyme and substrate affinity with the replacement of isoleucine by leucine at the  <dig> position. the results of the site-directed mutagenesis performed by the sequences alignment and bioinformatics analysis indicate that the  <dig> site is vital to improve the enzyme activity. the improvement of the catalytic efficiency could be attributed to four factors:  based on the model structures, the mutant is too far away from the substrate to participate in direct interaction, resulting in no mutation in the catalytic active site , which could be due to the possibility that the occurrence of most mutations in the active site would inactivate the enzyme, because shmt is one of the most highly conserved proteins, and the mutations likely exert their effects by changing the conformation of the active site rather than by interacting directly with substrates  <cit> ;  the three-dimensional structure  of anshmt shows that the isoleucine  is probably located at the end of an active channel and the plp binding region at the other end of the active channel, so the change of the  <dig> site residue has no effect on the plp binding progress;  when plp or other molecules bind the enzyme, the steric hindrance may be reduced by the residue and is altered by leucine; and  as the relative abundance of isoleucine and leucine are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, more steric hindrance is produced by the binding of the substrate to the enzymatic molecules through the cavity of the former. further exploration concerning the structure-activity relationship of shmt is necessary owing to the limited information about the relationship  <cit>  and the interesting site would be useful for these work.

CONCLUSIONS
the anshmt in the present study is a novel one from a. nicotianae, sharing  <dig> % similarity to the known shmt from e. coli. the enzyme showed better stability under weakly alkali conditions  than hyphomicrobium methylovorum’s shmt , and exhibited the optimal activity at ph  <dig>  and 40°c. through site-directed mutagenesis, the catalytic efficiency  of the mutant i249l was  <dig> -fold higher than that of wide type. these characteristics provide useful information about the interesting site, and the application of dop-pcr in cloning a novel glya gene.
