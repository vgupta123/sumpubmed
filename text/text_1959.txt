BACKGROUND
perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan with preferred localization to vascular basement membranes, is comprised of a ~ <dig> kda protein core with five distinct domains . domains ii-v share structural homologies with other protein modules  <cit> . in contrast, n-terminal domain i  is structurally unique. as a ~ <dig> kda protein core, plndi contains  <dig> amino acid residues that give rise to a sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin  module localized downstream of three ser-asp-gly motifs that serve as glycosaminoglycan  attachment sites  <cit> .

through the chondroitin and heparan sulfate gag chains attached to domain i, perlecan functions as a ligand reservoir for storage, release, and protection of heparin-binding growth factors . these interactions allow perlecan to modulate a range of biological functions, including angiogenesis  <cit> . recent studies suggest immobilized forms of perlecan and plndi bind vegf <dig> to coordinate developmental angiogenesis by modulating vegf165/vegfr- <dig> signaling  <cit> . however, a role for soluble forms of plndi and the mechanism by which it modulates vegf165/vegfr- <dig> signaling is unclear.

angiogenic activities of vegfs are mediated primarily through two receptors  <cit> , vegfr- <dig> or fms-like tyrosine kinase  <dig>  <cit>  and vegfr- <dig>  also known as kinase domain receptor, and fetal liver kinase  <dig>  <cit> . although vegfr- <dig> exhibits higher binding affinity for vegfs, vegfr- <dig> dominates vegf induced mitogenic and angiogenic responses on endothelial cells  <cit> . vegfr- <dig> signaling is enhanced by interactions with co-receptors such as heparin/heparan sulfate and neuropilin  <dig>   <cit> . in addition, vegf binding to vegfr- <dig> and nrp- <dig> is enhanced by exogenous heparin  <cit> . although the natural cell surface and basement membrane polysaccharide, in vivo, is heparan sulfate, not heparin, few cell surface or extracellular hspgs have been shown to modulate vegf/vegfr interactions  <cit> .

herein, we tested the hypothesis that soluble forms of recombinant plndi bind and increase vegf165/vegfr- <dig> interactions on human bone marrow endothelial cells, in vitro. observations from this investigation suggests soluble forms of recombinant plndi are biologically active and capable of interacting with components of the vegfr- <dig> signaling complex, enhance activity and downstream signaling related to endothelial cell angiogenic processes.

RESULTS
purification and biochemical characterization of plndi
recombinant plndi was purified from conditioned media of hek  <dig> ebna clones as reported previously  <cit> , and further enriched by passage through a sepharose cl-6b column. this additional step removed high molecular weight contaminants secreted into the serum free media . aliquots of the eluted product were subsequently analyzed by sds-page and western blotting to identify the gag chain composition and preparation purity.

in coomassie blue stained sds-page gels, undigested samples displayed a broad band between ~45- <dig> kda ; whereas aliquots pre-treated with a heparinase cocktail yielded a distinct band at ~ <dig> kda, with a broad band between  <dig> - <dig> kda . chondroitinase abc pre-digestion yielded a distinct band at ~ <dig> kda and broad band between  <dig> - <dig> kda . pre-digestion with both gag lyases yielded a single band at  <dig> kda . the additional bands appearing in figure 1a, lanes 2- <dig>  represent bsa , chondroitinase abc , and heparinases i , ii , and iii .

in alcian blue stained sds-page gels, undigested samples displayed a broad band between ~45- <dig> kda . aliquots pre-treated with a heparinase cocktail yielded a broad band between ~50- <dig> kda . chondroitinase abc pre-digestion yielded a broad band between ~50- <dig> kda . pre-digestion with both gag lyases abolished the majority staining.

the presence of plndi was confirmed by western blotting using anti-plndi specific antibodies  and antibodies  to anti-Δ-heparan sulfate that recognize heparan sulfate neo-epitopes, generated following heparinase cleavage . neither antibody recognized undigested products; however, anti-plndi antibodies recognized partially digested products  and both antibodies recognize a distinct band at  <dig> kda . the  <dig> kda band reflects the domain i core protein adorned with gag chain linkage residues following heparinase digestion.

biochemical analysis of plndi suggests a protein and uronic acid content of 49% and 37%, respectively . hexosamine  compositional analysis revealed plndi gags are composed predominantly of galactosamine  relative to glucosamine  . the disaccharide composition of purified plndi revealed 6-sulfated disaccharide as the major Δdi-cs with lesser amounts of nonsulfated and 4-sulfated disaccharides . the major Δdi-hs derived from plndi was nonsulfated and Δdi-s <dig> with considerable, but lesser amounts of Δdi-s <dig>  -6-sulfated, -n-sulfated, and -tris disaccharides . the hs gag chains on plndi contain approximately  <dig> fold more 6-o- than 2-o-sulfation.

vegf <dig> binds to plndi in a heparan sulfate dependent manner
to identify requirement for vegf <dig> binding to plndi, both solid and solution phase binding assays were performed. in solid phase binding assays, immobilized plndi binds vegf <dig> in a heparan sulfate dependent manner . heparinase cocktail treatment of plndi, prior to immobilization on nitrocellulose, reduced vegf <dig> binding by ~75% . in contrast, pre-digestion with chondroitinase abc did not alter vegf <dig> binding. studies with the plndi protein core, prepared following digestion with a mixture of both enzymes, suggest vegf <dig> poorly binds this region. vegf antibodies do not bind immobilized plndi . in competitive inhibition assays, heparin  prevented ~80% of vegf <dig> binding to plndi .

in solution, requirements for vegf <dig> binding to plndi were similar, but the capacity of binding demonstrated ph dependence . when the ph of solution was reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  then  <dig> , vegf <dig> binding was reduced by 50% and 80%, respectively . to identify vegf <dig> specific binding, the background binding of vegf <dig> to nitrocellulose was subtracted from total bound to plndi  <cit> . employing this approach, plndi-hs chains account for nearly all vegf <dig> binding, and the presence of cs chains masks vegf <dig> interaction with hs . in panel b, neutral ph was chosen to more closely reflect tissue culture conditions of subsequent experiments.

plndi modulation of vegf <dig> bio-activity
to identify a role for plndi in modulating vegf <dig> activity in vitro, human bone marrow endothelial cells were employed in two independent assays: 1) vegf165-enhanced capillary tube-like formation; 2) vegf165-enhanced phosphorylation of vegfr- <dig>  in capillary tube-like formation assays, the ability of bone marrow endothelial cells to form tube-like structures in the presence of exogenous vegf <dig> +/- plndi was quantified. under serum free conditions, the addition of soluble vegf <dig>  and plndi demonstrated dose dependent increases in lengths of tube-like structures formed . optimal concentrations for vegf <dig>  and plndi  increased tube-like formation 35% and 24%, respectively.

studies employing plndi, pre-treated with either chondroitinase abc and/or a heparinase cocktail suggests the ability of plndi to enhance tube-like formation is hs chain dependent . moreover, plndi activity is further enhanced when its cs chains are removed. interestingly, plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures combine to enhance tube-like formation 16% relative to vegf <dig> alone . the synergy between plndi and vegf <dig> is plndi-hs chain dependent . plndi protein core/vegf <dig> mixtures produce tube-like structures indifferent from those by vegf <dig> alone. unexpectedly, heparin/vegf <dig> mixtures do not synergize in this system .

since the presence of endogenous cell surface hs complicates the studies above, experiments employing bone marrow endothelial cells without cell surface hs were performed. under these conditions, vegf <dig> and plndi enhance tube-like formation ; however, plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures did not combine to further enhance the lengths of tube-like structures. subsequent dose response studies suggested elevated concentrations of vegf <dig> and plndi are required for maximal activity. increasing plndi concentration two fold  restored synergy with vegf <dig> in a plndi-hs chain dependent manner .

because the role of hs in heparin-binding growth factor activity may involve interactions between hs, ligand, and cell surface receptors, the ability of plndi-hs to modulate vegf165-induced vegfr- <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated by western blot using vegfr- <dig>  specific antibodies. vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation at tyr- <dig> results in recruitment of several adapter proteins whose subsequent downstream signaling supports endothelial cell survival and migration  <cit> . to perform these studies, we employed bone marrow endothelial cells whose cell surface hs were first removed by exposure to heparinases. under these conditions, the exogenous addition of plndi and vegf <dig>  enhanced vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation at tyr- <dig> . the signal intensity of phosphorylation increased over time, peaked after ten minutes, then returned to control levels after  <dig> minutes . the addition of plndi, adorned with only hs chains, enhances tyr- <dig> phosphorylation ~ <dig> fold relative to intact plndi . studies employing plndi preparations pre-treated with mixtures of chondroitinase abc and heparinase enzymes did not completely attenuate phosphorylation . heparin addition  also enhanced vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation .

relative to either alone, plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures stimulate peak phosphorylation after only  <dig>  minutes . to identify the role of plndi-hs in modulating vegf <dig> induced vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation at tyr- <dig>  plndi preparations adorned with either cs, hs, or without gags were pre-mixed with vegf <dig>  the absence of hs chains on plndi reduced the signal intensity of phosphorylation 43% . in contrast, preparations decorated only with hs chains enhance the signal intensity of phosphorylation ~ <dig> fold . the absence of cs and hs chains did not completely reduce the intensity of phosphorylation relative to control .

to determine if plndi/vegf <dig> enhanced vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation also promotes downstream signaling, blots were stripped then re-probed with antibodies specific for total and phosphorylated forms of akt. plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures enhance the signal intensity of phosphorylated akt ~ <dig> fold, relative to vegf <dig> alone , and ~40% of this activity is plndi-hs chain dependent.

since plndi may modulate phosphorylation via direct interactions with vegfr- <dig> or a candidate co-receptor, we performed binding studies with immobilized recombinant vegfr- <dig> and nrp- <dig>  plndi binds vegfr- <dig> and nrp- <dig> ; however, a higher percentage of plndi binds nrp- <dig>  the presence of vegf <dig> but not vegf <dig>  enhances plndi binding to vegfr- <dig>  and nrp- <dig> . the presence of heparin  reduces plndi binding to nrp- <dig> more than 60%. in contrast, plndi binding to vegfr- <dig> was poorly competed away by heparin .

discussion
for the first time, we have characterized the ability of recombinant plndi to bind vegf <dig> and modulate its angiogenic activity, in vitro. we have shown that soluble forms of plndi are capable of modulating vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation, as well as vegf165-induced phosphorylation of vegfr- <dig>  and that the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains adorning plndi are important for these activities. together, our observations suggest soluble forms of plndi may form and/or stabilize a complex between vegf <dig>  nrp- <dig>  and vegfr- <dig> to enhance angiogenic events and vegfr- <dig> signaling in human bone marrow endothelial cells .

in contrast to our previous reports  <cit> , the purity of plndi employed in the present investigation was enhanced by passage through a sepharose cl-6b column. sds-page, western blot and monosaccharide analysis suggest the molecular weight and gag chain composition of plndi are similar to species previously characterized  <cit> . moreover, these observations predict our preparation contains at least two species of plndi: one adorning predominately cs and the other predominately hs chains. interestingly, the cs and hs disaccharide composition of plndi reported herein is different from species recently characterized by whitelock et al.  <cit> , as well as that reported for full length perlecan purified from bovine rib growth plate cartilage, huaec and rt <dig> cell lines  <cit> . these differences could be due to: 1) cell culture conditions; 2) approaches for purification; and 3) approaches employed for disaccharide analysis. regardless, since fewer 4-sulfated cs residues and more 2-sulfated and 6-sulfated hs residues were identified it is reasonable to conclude that the function of plndi employed herein is distinct from forms previously reported. indeed, subtle variations in hs substructure profoundly affect heparin-binding growth factor and receptor interactions, and thus the activity of perlecan  <cit> .

while the role of hs chains on perlecan have been most widely investigated with regard to regulation of fgf- <dig> activity  <cit> , few studies have reported on perlecan-vegf <dig> interactions  <cit> . moreover, the gag modifications required specifically for perlecan-vegf <dig> interactions have not been described. nevertheless, studies with heparin/hs suggest 2-o- and 6-o- sulfation is important for vegf binding and activity  <cit> . although the abundance of 2-o- and 6-o-sulfation on plndi-hs suggests it harbors the capacity to interact with vegf <dig>  a correlation between vegf <dig> affinity and abundance of a particular disaccharide or the overall level of hs sulfation has not been observed  <cit> . thus, growth factor binding is likely determined by hs domain organization . since hs chains on recombinant plndi are likely to be short  relative to those on tumor-derived perlecan   <cit> , we predict  <dig> residues comprise a single hs chain on plndi . moreover, since six or seven oligosaccharide residues are sufficient to fully occupy the hs binding site for vegf <dig>  <cit> , we further predict that six vegf <dig> binding sites  may be available on each hs chain attached to plndi.

the hs dependent binding of vegf <dig> to immobilized plndi described herein is consistent with recent reports  <cit> . in contrast, a new communication has reported plndi does not bind immobilized vegf <dig>  <cit> . we suspect the concentration and/or the disaccharide composition of plndi employed therein may account for the contrasting observations. our studies with plndi in solution suggest vegf <dig> binding to plndi in solution is not only hs but ph dependent. the marked reduction in vegf <dig> binding to plndi under acidic conditions, a novel observation, is consistent with previous publications describing the attenuation of vegf <dig> binding with low concentrations of heparin under acidic conditions, and its potentiation at neutral ph  <cit> .

to identify the ability of soluble, exogenous plndi to modulate vegf <dig> activity, in vitro, tube-like formation studies were performed with human bone marrow endothelial cells seeded on growth factor reduced  matrigel. we hypothesized that plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures would enhance the lengths of tube-like structures formed over vegf <dig> alone. while our observations support this hypothesis, we were surprised that plndi addition, alone, also enhanced the length of tube-like structures. given our experimental approach, the enhancement of tube-like formation by soluble, exogenous, plndi may also reflect interactions with other matrix molecules  and heparin-binding growth factors present in gfr matrigel reported to interact with plndi  <cit> . this possibility, however, should not discount the ability of exogenous plndi to interact directly with human bone marrow endothelial cells, or the possibility that the presence of heparin-binding molecules and growth factors may even mask the full activity of plndi.

interestingly, under conditions where bone marrow endothelial cells were pre-treated with a heparinase cocktail, the additive effect of plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures on tube-like formation was not observed unless the concentration of plndi was increased two fold. while these observations suggest plndi-hs chains can modulate vegf <dig> activity, in vitro, heparin/vegf <dig> mixtures , did yield similar results. we remain puzzled by this observation since heparin/vegf <dig> mixtures combine to enhance vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation, suggesting heparin is active in our system.

at the cellular/receptor level, we analyzed vegfr- <dig> auto-phosphorylation to identify requirements for plndi modulation of vegf <dig> activity, in vitro. while both vegfr- <dig> and vegfr- <dig> contribute to vegf induced signals, vegfr- <dig> dominates vegf induced mitogenic and angiogenic responses in endothelial cells  <cit> . of the six tyrosine phosphorylation sites identified on the intracellular domain of vegfr- <dig>  we report on one associated with endothelial cell survival and migration  <cit> . together, our observations suggest exogenous soluble plndi, alone, can stimulate vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation at tyr- <dig>  moreover, plndi fragments harboring only hs chains further enhance vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation, suggesting the presence of cs chains masks activity. these studies importantly extend those recently reported for full length perlecan  <cit>  by demonstrating delivery of plndi or co-delivery with vegf <dig> are sufficient to enhance vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation, and promote downstream signaling . given our approach , our observations suggest plndi/vegf <dig> mixtures enhance survival signaling  of human bone marrow endothelial cells, in vitro. consistent with this conclusion, our unpublished observations suggest vegfr- <dig> phosphorylation at tyr- <dig> and tyr  <dig>  and phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk, erk1/ <dig>   <cit> , are unaltered.

finally, to determine if plndi has the capacity to bind and modulate the activity of vegfr- <dig> directly, we performed plndi binding studies against immobilized vegfr- <dig>  and nrp- <dig>  outcomes from these studies suggest plndi-hs chains, similar to heparin/hs, harbor the capacity to interact with vegfrs and co-receptors  <cit> , and enhance vegfr- <dig> signaling  <cit> . we suspect plndi-hs chain binding to nrp- <dig> occurs via its heparin binding domain  <cit> . in contrast, plndi binding to vegfr- <dig> is less dependent on hs chains. heparin concentrations up to  did not appreciably alter binding . interestingly, the presence of vegf <dig> enhances plndi binding to vegfr- <dig>  suggesting the formation of a complex between plndi/vegf165/vegfr- <dig> is possible. our observations also suggest that modulation of vegfr- <dig> signaling by plndi may involve complex interactions with more than one ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings presented herein demonstrate exogenous, soluble, recombinant plndi is sufficient to bind and modulate the activity of the vegfr- <dig> signaling complex via hs interactions, in vitro. moreover, plndi may have activities independent of those with heparin-binding growth factors in supporting tube-like formation, in vitro. figure  <dig> provides a simplified visual depiction of how plndi may impact angiogenic events in the absence or presence of vegf <dig>  plndi unbound or bound to vegf <dig> is liberated via cleavage within its sea module  <cit>  or the single immunoglobulin g-like region of domain ii  <cit>  during matrix turnover, wound healing, or disease progression. in the absence of vegf <dig>  plndi-hs may bind to nrp- <dig>  vegfr- <dig>  or support complex formation with both to signal downstream angiogenic events. when vegf <dig> is present plndi interactions with nrp- <dig> and vegfr- <dig> are optimized, leading to enhanced downstream signaling and angiogenesis.
