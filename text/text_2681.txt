BACKGROUND
salmonella is one of the major causes of food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide and poses a considerable threat to public health. in the united states  alone there are approximately  <dig>  million illnesses,  <dig>  hospitalizations, and  <dig> deaths annually  <cit> . humans generally acquire salmonellosis through consumption of contaminated food or contact with infected animals or a contaminated environment  <cit> . emergence of multidrug-resistant salmonella in human infections is particularly serious due to increased morbidity and mortality  <cit> .

more than  <dig>  serotypes of salmonella have been identified and significant variability has been found in virulence, infectious dose, and host. most human salmonella infections are caused by relatively few salmonella subtypes   <cit> , but all salmonella serotypes are considered potentially pathogenic  <cit> . farm animals are recognized as important reservoirs for salmonella and other food-borne pathogens  <cit> . many salmonella serotypes have been found in samples from dairy animals and their environment, some of which have also been isolated in human cases  <cit> . reduction of salmonella prevalence in farm animals and bacterial loads in the contaminated environment is important to decrease the risk of zoonotic salmonella infection  <cit> .

aiming to ensure a safe food supply through identifying pathogen transmission pathways and subsequent best management practices in dairy farms, the regional dairy quality management alliance  and the agriculture research service  of the usda established a longitudinal observational study on three commercial dairy farms in the northeastern us  <cit> , one of which was located in pennsylvania. fecal samples were intensively collected from all adult animals in this herd beginning in the spring of  <dig>  these samples were tested for salmonella and a number of other food-borne pathogens  <cit> . after an initial outbreak of salmonella cerro, a subsequent outbreak of salmonella kentucky with a high level of prevalence and long-term endemic infection in this farm was found  <cit> . drug-resistant salmonella kentucky  from human cases has recently been identified from a study of national salmonella surveillance systems from france, england and wales, denmark, and the united states  <cit> . the identification of salmonella kentucky is also a common occurrence in poultry  <cit> .

understanding the transmission dynamics that underlie observed shedding patterns from longitudinal field data is essential for the effective design of salmonella prevention and intervention. as the transmission dynamics of salmonella spp. are determined by complex interactions among host, pathogen, and environment, mathematical modeling approaches have been applied to provide insights in the understanding of transmission  <cit> . however, a common problem in mathematical models in epidemiology is how to accurately and reliably estimate the non-observable model parameters such as the transmission rate, given the available longitudinal field data. to solve this problem, a number of bayesian inference approaches for infectious disease transmission models have been developed  <cit> . posterior distributions of parameters can generally be computed using an explicit likelihood function given parameter prior distributions with the help of markov chain monte carlo  methods  <cit> , or using a likelihood-free approach, the approximate bayesian computation  technique  <cit>  with a newly proposed efficient sequential monte carlo algorithm  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to infer from longitudinal field data the key epidemiological parameters that are important to understand the invasion ability and transmission dynamics in an outbreak and subsequent endemicity of salmonella kentucky on a dairy farm. specifically, we estimated the transmission rate , the rate  and shape  parameters of the gamma distribution for the infectious  period, and the basic reproduction ratio  using the approximate bayesian computation technique.

methods
longitudinal field data
the dairy herd  in pennsylvania consisted of approximately 100- <dig> adult cows housed in a free stall barn  <cit> . calves from this herd were transferred to an off-site rearing center at 6 months of age and were returned to the herd as replacement animals within  <dig> to 2 months prior to their first calving. intensive fecal samples were collected for all adult cows in the herd with a sampling interval of  <dig> to 8 weeks during the study period. methods for isolation and serotyping of salmonella were previously described  <cit> .

the longitudinal data used in this study are composed of observed within-herd prevalence  of animals shedding salmonella kentucky for a total of  <dig> time points from january  <dig> to december  <dig>  as the sensitivity of the culture test for salmonella is generally estimated to be imperfect and relatively low, we used a correction to account for likely false-negative culture results. this rule states that a negative test found between two immediate  positive tests in an individual cow was assumed to be a false-negative test and this negative test was corrected to be positive . the specificity of the culture test for salmonella was assumed to be one, so there were no false-positive tests.

the sirs model
multiple episodes of shedding of salmonella kentucky were observed in individual cows’ test result profiles. due to the assumed perfect test specificity and imperfect test sensitivity , at least two or more consecutive negative tests had to appear between these test-positive episodes to define a second or higher shedding  period. on the basis of the shedding pattern of individual cows, we developed a susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible  transmission model with the following assumptions:

 first lactation animals entering the herd as replacement animals were assumed to be susceptible  because no positive tests were found in any heifers leaving for the off-site facility or returning to the herd.

 test-positive animals  were assumed to be in the infectious state .

 the infectious  period was assumed to follow a gamma distribution f = ntn- <dig> exp /Г) with two parameters, the rate  and shape , reflecting that time since infection is important  <cit> . when the shape parameter  is one, the gamma distribution reduces to an exponential distribution.

 susceptible animals  remained in their susceptible state until they became infectious  at rate β i/ n, where the transmission rate is denoted by β.

 the time period covering two or more consecutive negative tests in individual animals between the two neighboring positive tests was relatively long, approximately 3 months or more. within that time period, animals were assumed to build their immunity, becoming recovered . eventually during that period, the recovered animals  lost their immunity and became susceptible  again at rate ϕ.

 susceptible animals were assumed not to be distinguished based on the presence or absence of prior exposure to salmonella .

 direct cow-cow transmission was considered to represent the common fecal-oral transmission route of salmonella kentucky in the herd.

 herd size was assumed to be a constant , reflecting a constant size of the milk producing herd.

 to maintain a constant herd size, we assumed the replacement rate  of the milking herd was the same as the removal rate  of animals from the herd.

there are a total of  <dig> parameters in the sirs model described in figure  <dig>  three of these are unknown and to be estimated: the transmission rate  and the rate  and shape  parameters describing the gamma distribution for the infectious period. the replacement rate  of animals was assumed to be constant and was calculated from the animal movement data to be  <dig>  - <dig>  representing the average duration of survival of cows in the milking herd at approximately  <dig>  years. the rate of immunity loss -1) was also assumed constant and calculated to be around 3 months because it needed to be equal to or less than the time period for at least two consecutive negative tests  state and its next susceptible  state).

the system of ordinary differential equations describing the transmission dynamic model  with a gamma distribution for the infectious period in figure  <dig> is given in additional file 1: appendix a.

method of estimating parameters
we applied the approximate bayesian computation  technique  <cit>  to infer the unknown epidemiological parameters  given the longitudinal data and the sirs model. uniform  prior distributions were assumed for the  <dig> unknown parameters, β ∈ , γ ∈ , and n ∈  <cit> .

unknown parameters  were sampled from their prior distributions and these sampled values were used to numerically solve the system of ordinary differential equations . the sum of squared errors between the fitted and observed prevalence was calculated. if the sum of squared errors was less than a desired tolerance value, then the sampled parameter values were accepted. however this rejection algorithm was not effective and was not able to put into in practice due to high computational demands. an efficient algorithm recently developed for abc using the sequential monte carlo method was implemented for parameter estimate and model selection for nonlinear dynamic systems  <cit> . in this study we used this efficient algorithm for parameter estimation.

to examine the invasion ability, we estimated the basic reproduction ratio , which represents the number of secondary cases caused by the introduction of a primary index case into a fully susceptible population during its whole infectious period. the basic reproduction ratio  of the sirs model in this study is a function of the other three parameters and was obtained using the next-generation matrix  <cit> :

  r0=βμ1-nγnγ+μn 

posterior predictive check and cross-validation
using the estimates from the posterior distributions of parameters , stochastic simulations based on the direct gillespie algorithm for the sirs model were performed  <cit> . the expected prevalence and its  <dig> % and  <dig> % quantiles were compared to the observed prevalence. as we had only one dataset of the observed longitudinal prevalence , cross-validation was performed to check the behavior of the sirs model. a total of  <dig> datasets for cross-validation were formed by removing each data point once from the full observed prevalence data set.

impact of the rate of loss immunity
as the rate at which immunity wanes  was uncertain and partly based on the sampling interval, we repeated the abc analyses with a slower rate,  <dig>  - <dig>  to investigate the effects of varying the rate of immunity loss  on the estimation of the transmission rate , the rate  and shape  parameters for the gamma distribution for the infectious period, and the basic reproduction ratio .

RESULTS
posterior distributions of parameters 
posterior distributions of the transmission rate , and the rate  and shape  parameters of the gamma distribution describing the infectious period are shown in the top row of figure  <dig>  all distributions were unimodal. for the transmission rate  and the rate of recovery  the ranges of these two posterior distributions were relatively narrow. the transmission rate  showed a mean of  <dig>  month- <dig> with a 95% credible interval of  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average recovery rate  was  <dig>  month- <dig> with a 95% credible interval of  <dig>  to  <dig>  month- <dig>  the shape parameter  had large variability with a median of  <dig>  with a 95% credible interval of  <dig> to  <dig> 

the bottom row of figure  <dig> shows scatter plots of paired parameters. each scatter plot illustrates three time snapshots from the start of simulation to the middle and finally to the stable state – the process of how the sequential monte carlo algorithm in abc leading to the convergence posterior distribution.

the infectious period and the basic reproduction ratio 
the distributions of the infectious period and the basic reproduction ratio  using the estimates from the posterior distributions of parameters  are shown in figure 3a and 3b, respectively. the average infectious period had a mean of  <dig>  months  with a 95% credible interval of  <dig>   to  <dig>   months. the r <dig> had a mean of  <dig>  with a 95% credible interval of  <dig>  to  <dig> .

posterior predictive check
comparison between the observed prevalence and the expected  prevalence with the predicted  <dig> % and  <dig> % quantile is demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the expected prevalence exhibited agreed well with the observed prevalence before salmonella kentucky reached endemic prevalence. all of the observed prevalence data points were within the range from the predicted  <dig> % to  <dig> % quantile; two observed prevalence data points, the 12th and 14th, were quite close to the low  <dig> % and high  <dig> % quantiles, respectively.

cross-validation
boxplots of the transmission rate , the recovery rate , the infectious period, and the basic reproduction ratio  are shown for  <dig> sub-datasets in figure  <dig>  the transmission rates  mostly ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  month- <dig>  and the recovery rate parameters  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  month- <dig>  the infectious period was mostly between  <dig> and 9 months, and the r <dig> value was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for almost all datasets.

impact of varying the rate of immunity
we studied the impacts of varying the rate of immunity  on the transmission rate , the rate  and shape  parameters of the gamma distribution for the infectious period, and the basic reproduction ratio . when the rate of immunity  was changed from  <dig>  - <dig> to  <dig>  - <dig>  thereby increased from 3 months to 4 months), the estimated transmission rate  parameter , and the rate of recovery  parameter , and the basic reproduction ratio   changed only slightly, but the shape parameter  had a relatively large change and was well inferred . posterior distributions of these parameters are given in figure b <dig> in additional file 1: appendix b.

discussion
the mean estimate of the basic reproduction ratio  for salmonella kentucky in adult dairy cows from our data is  <dig> , which indicates a relatively mild infectiousness . the relatively modest r <dig> value also indicates that preventative efforts to reduce the reproduction rate to values below  <dig> may be reasonable and even so-called ‘leaky’ vaccines may prove to be sufficiently efficacious to provide herd immunity  <cit> .

the mean duration of the infectious  period is 8 months. this estimated duration is long compared to other salmonella strains causing clinical signs in dairy cattle, such as salmonella typhimurium and salmonella dublin  <cit> . the mild infectiousness and long infectious period together explained the observed dynamic pattern of salmonella kentucky in figure 4; the prevalence of animals shedding salmonella kentucky gradually increased during the epidemic phase and then a relatively stable long-term endemic infection was established in the herd.

the posterior distribution of the shape parameter  of the gamma distribution for the infectious period did not include n = 1; therefore, the conventional assumption that the infectious period is described by an exponential distribution was found to be inappropriate and a more realistic gamma distribution for the infectious period was favored. this indicates that time since infection is important in the transmission dynamics of salmonella kentucky in adult dairy cattle. consequently, strategies for prevention and intervention could be affected by the infection time of animals in the herd  <cit> . although large variability of the shape parameter is observed with an assumption of a 3-month period of immunity loss, it can be significantly reduced if a 4-month period of immunity loss is assumed .

we expect that for many more persistent infections, the assumption of an exponential rate of disappearance from the infectious state will be incorrect. implementation of non-exponential distributions in ode-based parameter estimation is not straightforward. the ability to use distributions other than exponential, with the gamma distribution being an attractive alternative, may be one of the key benefits of using abc for parameter estimation, as no explicit likelihood function needed to be defined. this was especially helpful in this study, where we used a gamma distribution for the infectious period. however, the lack of an explicit likelihood function requires highly demanding computational efforts. therefore, the implementation of an efficient algorithm in abc as shown here became imperative.

posterior distributions of the transmission rate and the rate of recovery  obtained from abc  were relatively narrow. this was also described in a previous study  <cit> , partly due to the use of a deterministic model  in the simulation of abc. if a stochastic sirs model  was used in abc, the credible intervals would be wider due to the addition of stochasticity into the sirs model. the transmission rate  and the recovery rate  parameters had significantly better accuracy than the shape parameter  as shown in the top row of figure  <dig>  which indicated that these two parameters were more sensitive to the model and data than the shape parameter   <cit> .

we did not apply abc to the stochastic sirs model because the estimated values of the transmission rate , the rate of recovery  and the shape parameter  from the deterministic sirs model were sufficient to capture the observed prevalence pattern  using a stochastic sirs model implementing the direct gillespie algorithm. we also did not perform elaborate model selection in this study because the sirs model appears to be capable of explaining the observed transmission dynamics of salmonella kentucky. as mentioned before, the observed intermittent shedding may be explained by the relatively poor sensitivity of culture methods and we therefore corrected for the occasional assumed false-negative result. further research to distinguish between assuming true intermittent shedding  <cit>  and a non-perfect test sensitivity in continuous shedding may be necessary.

the posterior predictive check shown in figure  <dig> indicated that the estimated transmission rate  and the rate  and shape  parameters in figure  <dig> were reasonable, as stochastic simulations for the sirs model with these parameter estimates from their posterior distributions were able to capture the observed dynamic  pattern. the cross validation  suggested that the estimate of the basic reproduction ratio  was fairly consistent. although the shape parameter had large variability , it did not have a substantial effect on the basic reproduction ratio. in other words, neither the basic reproduction ratio  nor the dynamic pattern were sensitive to changes in the shape parameter .

when varying the period of immunity from 3 months to 4 months, no significant changes were found in the transmission rate and the rate of the gamma distribution for the infectious period. however, serological data that are able to distinguish the recovered state  and the susceptible  state would help remove the uncertainty in the rate of immunity loss and increase the accuracy of parameter estimation, especially for the estimation of the shape parameter .

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible  model to describe the transmission of salmonella kentucky in an adult dairy herd. the important epidemiological parameters of the sirs model were estimated from a longitudinal data set using the approximate bayesian computation method. this study shows that salmonella kentucky has a mild invasion ability  and has a long average infectious period  in dairy cattle. these findings together provide an explanation for the observed prevalence pattern after invasion. the transmission rate and the recovery rate parameters are inferred with better accuracy than the shape parameter, therefore these two parameters are more sensitive to the model and the observed data. the estimated shape parameter  has large variability with a minimal value greater than one, indicating that the infectious period of salmonella kentucky in dairy cattle does not follow the conventionally assumed exponential distribution.
