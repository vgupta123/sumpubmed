BACKGROUND
the worldwide cosmetics market reached  <dig>  billion us dollars in  <dig>  which was a  <dig> % increase compared to  <dig>  <cit> . there are many compounds used as cosmetic ingredients, such as phycobiliprotein from natural sources, which is used as a colorant  <cit> , polysaccharides used as emulsifiers  <cit> , and a polymer used for mascara  <cit> .

much research has been conducted to develop appropriate materials for cosmetic ingredients. in particular, these studies focused not only on beauty care, but also on functional aspects. many trials are underway that aim to find ingredients for functional cosmetics, which would have whitening  <cit> , anti-oxidant  <cit>  or anti-ageing  <cit>  effects. any cosmetic ingredient has to satisfy several requirements, such as thermal stability, high dermal absorption rate, and perfume.

gallic acid  is a phenolic acid and a phytochemical derived from herbs. it is found in gallnuts, sumac, witch hazel, tea leaves, oak bark, and other plants  <cit> , and has anti-fungal  <cit> , anti-viral  <cit> , and antioxidant  <cit>  properties, which are useful for a cosmetic ingredient.

with the development of biotechnology, peptides can be now produced on a large scale massively produced, and are used in cosmetic industry as ingredients. peptides used in topical anti-ageing products are classified into  <dig> categories: carrier peptides, signaling peptides, enzyme inhibitors, and neurotransmitter inhibitors  <cit> . carrier peptides can deliver other components of cosmetic preparations when these are applied topically.

in this study, we explored the possibility of synthesis of a phytochemical  and a peptide for use as a cosmetic ingredient. we assessed  <dig> aspects of the novel compound : its safety, stability, functionality as a cosmetic ingredient. to evaluate the safety of galloyl-rgd to the skin, we measured the viability of hacat keratinocytes. to assess its stability, we measured its thermal stability. we also analysed its free radical–scavenging effect, and its ability to inhibit l-dopa formation and l-dopa oxidation.

RESULTS
galloyl-rgd purification using a c <dig> preparative column
we developed a method for synthetic peptide purification by high performance liquid chromatography  on an analytical c <dig> column  in a gradient using  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid in water and  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as solvents. although the purity of synthetic galloyl-rgd was about 70% , it increased up to 95% after hplc purification .

confirmation of galloyl-rgd structure by maldi-tof
galloyl-rgd was synthesized to combine rgd as a peptide to support physiological activity and gallic acid as a phytochemical to scavenge free radicals. a maldi-tof mass spectrometry assay  was conducted to confirm the molecular weight and chemical structure of galloyl-rgd . as shown in figure  <dig>  the galloyl-rgd produced met the quality standards required for a cosmetic material.

galloyl-rgd is stable for 60 days at alternating temperatures
storage conditions of cosmetics may change from low temperature  to room temperature , i.e. they may be subjected to temperature changes of ca. 20°c. for this reason, thermal stability is an important characteristic of cosmetic materials.

both gallic acid and galloyl-rgd were stable at alternating temperatures, but their stabilities were different depending on the storage period. the amounts remaining after storage for 20 days, 40 days, or 60 days were 81 ± 4%, 74 ± 6%, and 66 ± 23%, respectively, for gallic acid, and 94 ± 4%, 92 ± 8%, and 87 ± 29% for galloyl-rgd .

gallic acid was relatively unstable, and was degraded to 66 ± 2% on the end of the experiment, whereas galloyl-rgd was degraded by only 87 ± 2%.

galloyl-rgd is safe to hacat keratinocytes
human body is surrounded by keratinocytes, which protect it from various factors and prevent damage from chemicals, microbes and dehydration  <cit> . thus, development of new cosmetics should include measurements of their effects on keratinocytes.after treatment for 48 h, the viability of hacat keratinocytes was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and 80% in the presence of 10 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 500 ppm, and 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd, respectively . these results indicate that galloyl-rgd is safe to hacat keratinocytes at concentrations of up to 100 ppm.

galloyl-rgd scavenges free radicals produced by dpph and reactive oxygen species by uv irradiation
free radicals have both useful and harmful effects on organisms; they confer protection to host against harmful fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but may also induce host cell damage  <cit> . in the case of cosmetics, damage to epithelial cells in the skin is more important than other effects because most cosmetics are directly applied to the skin. the levels of free radicals are controlled by the balance of their production and elimination in the cells. a reduction in elimination relative to production could destroy epithelial cells of the skin.we found that the free radical –scavenging effect of galloyl-rgd after 48 h incubation was  <dig> % at 10 ppm, and the quantities of free radicals decreased with increasing galloyl-rgd concentrations in a dose-dependent manner . galloyl-rgd scavenged effectively free radical not only in the test tube but also efficiently eliminated ros which was generated by 60 min ultraviolet irradiation in hacat cells . the ros scavenging effect of galloyl-rgd both in 50 ppm and 100 ppm galloyl-rgd treatment groups was higher than in 20 ppm nac treatment.

galloyl-rgd efficiently inhibits l-dopa formation and l-dopa oxidation
tyrosinase converts tyrosine to  <dig> -dihydroxyphenylalanine , and if l-dopa is oxidized it is converted into dopaquinone, which is a precursor of melanin biosynthesis  <cit> . melanin is a pigment related to skin darkening. higher amounts of the above compounds result in larger black spots on the skin. the effect on melanin synthesis is one of the important parameters that need to be tested during development of new cosmetics.we measured l-dopa formation inhibition and suppression of l-dopa oxidation after incubation with galloyl-rgd for 48 h. the l-dopa formation inhibition rate was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % in the presence of 50 ppm, 100 ppm and 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd, respectively . as shown in figure 6b, galloyl-rgd suppressed l-dopa oxidation to  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % at 50 ppm, 100 ppm or 1000 ppm concentrations, respectively, compared to the control group.

discussion
galloyl-rgd is a synthetic conjugate of gallic acid and a peptide, synthesized for intended use as a new cosmetic ingredient, purified using hplc and validated by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. thermal stability of galloyl-rgd was tested at alternating temperatures . it was relatively safe to hacat keratinocytes, as their viability after 48 h incubation was  <dig> % in the presence of 500 ppm galloyl-rgd. in the 50 ppm galloyl-rgd–treated group,  <dig> % of free radical was removed, ros was scavenged more effectively more than by 20 ppm nac-treated group in hacat cells, and treatment with 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd suppressed not only activation-dopa formation  but also l-dopa oxidation .

to pursue the beauty is a basic human instinct, and as people were looking for ways to make themselves more beautiful the cosmetic industry has significantly grown. recently, the number of trials aimed at finding more effective ingredients for cosmetics has increased, especially search for the functional ingredients effective for whitening  <cit> , smoothing the creases  <cit> , scavenging free radicals  <cit> , or anti-ageing  <cit> .

for a long time, natural products have been used for multiple purposes such as remedies, cosmetics, culinary materials, or additives; these various functions are due to multiple phytochemicals in the natural products. a number of recent studies have found that the functions of natural products depend on constituent phytochemicals  <cit> .

gallic acid is a phytochemical, which has been isolated from several plants such as emblica officinalis gaertn  <cit> , phaleria macrocarpa boerl  <cit> , quercus robur  <cit> , and castanea sativa l.  <cit>  and has anti-fungal  <cit> , anti-viral  <cit> , antioxidant  <cit>  properties. however, gallic acid is thermally unstable  <cit> , which makes its use as cosmetic ingredient difficult.

to overcome this weakness, we considered gallic acid conjugation with a peptide. recently, many peptides have been introduced, as they not only have important functions in specific fields, but are also able to improve something more effective. for example, peptides have been used in cosmetic industry to increase skin permeability and duration  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that galloyl-rgd is a promising candidate for a cosmetic ingredient.
