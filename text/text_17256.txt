BACKGROUND
multicellular eukaryotes develop diverse small noncoding rna  mechanisms for gene regulation at both dna and rna levels. in plants, most sncrnas are generated by rnase iii-type endonuclease dicers or dicer-like  proteins, and then incorporated into argonaute  proteins to exert their gene regulatory functions at the transcriptional level through dna methylation and/or histone modification, and at the posttranscriptional level by mrna cleavage, mrna degradation or translational repression .

micrornas  and endogenous small-interfering rnas  are two major classes of sncrnas. mirnas are typically processed from rna polymerase ii transcripts that fold into hairpin structures  <cit> . in plants, such hairpin-structured pre-mirnas are then processed by dcl proteins in the nucleus to release ~22-nt double-stranded rnas with ~2-nt 3′ overhangs, namely mirna/mirna* duplexes. the mature mirnas are then loaded into the ago-containing rna-induced silencing complexes  in the cytoplasm to exert their regulatory effect by guiding the risc to target transcripts through complete or partial complementary base pairing  <cit> .

endo-sirnas have more diverse sources of origin. endo-sirnas arise from long double stranded rnas , which are formed from overlapped antisense transcripts or products of rna-dependent rna polymerases  . in plants, different classes of endo-sirnas have been described based on their distinct characteristics, biogenesis pathways and functions  <cit> . trans-acting sirnas  and sirnas from natural antisense transcripts  are two major classes of endo-sirnas. typically 21-nt in length and arranged in registers of 21-nt long phasing  <cit> , ta-sirnas are generated by phased dicer processing of noncoding tas genes or mrna transcripts initiated by mirnas .

several genic regions have been annotated as ta-sirna-yielding loci. in arabidopsis, for example, a tas <dig> gene has a pair of mir <dig> binding sites, which define and produce a single rna strand that is subsequently turned into a double stranded rna by rdr <dig> polymerase. the double stranded rna is subsequently cleaved by dcl <dig> to release a series of ~21-nt phased ta-sirnas. among these ta-sirnas, one ta-sirna species, named tasiarf, is broadly conserved and targets genes in the arf family in trans
 <cit> . moreover, arabidopsis has three tas <dig> homologues   <cit> , rice carries three tas <dig> loci  <cit> , and p. patens has four   <cit> . besides tas <dig>  three other tas genes  have been reported in arabidopsis, while tas <dig> is the only one broadly conserved, from rice and arabidopsis to p. patens and cassava  <cit> . ta-sirnas may also arise from coding genes; a large number of genes encoding nucleotide binding site–leucine-rich repeat  plant innate immune receptors have been reported to give rise to ta-sirnas, which were triggered by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> .

endo-sirnas can also be generated from cis-natural antisense transcripts  . these sirnas, named as nat-sirnas, can be induced by abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit>  or can accumulate in specific developmental stages  <cit> . the biogenesis of salt- and bacterium-induced nat-sirnas in arabidopsis requires dcl <dig> and/or dcl <dig>  rdr <dig>  and pol iv  <cit> . for example, the expression of ariadne <dig> is de-repressed in dcl <dig>  hen <dig>  hyl <dig>  sde <dig>  rdr <dig> and sgs <dig> mutants, suggesting that the nat-sirnas from the cis-nat pair ariadne <dig> and kokopelli are dependent of dcl <dig>  hen <dig>  hyl <dig>  rdr <dig>  sgs <dig> and poliv  <cit> .

despite the broad existence of ta-sirnas and nat-sirnas in plant species, many of their features remain to be studied. it requires further effort to gain a comprehensive view of the genomic loci where ta-sirnas and nat-sirnas arise and to understand their regulatory roles in adaptation to dynamic environmental conditions. further, little is known about the expression of mirnas and endo-sirnas in euphorbiaceous plants. here, we performed a comprehensive study of mirnas, ta-sirna and nat-sirna in two agri-economic important euphorbiaceous plants, cassava  and castor bean . euphorbiaceae is one of the largest families in angiosperms, consisting of more than  <dig> genera and about  <dig>  species. cassava is the most important crop in africa and southeast asia and a primary source of food in most parts of the regions. castor oil from castor bean has a medical use and is a critical raw material for many industrial products, such as lubricants and paints. cassava and castor bean are capable of high photosynthesis and have complex traits for adapting to dynamic environments, making them ideal for studying small-rna mediated gene regulation in stress response and stress acclimation. in the current study, we focus on identification and characterization of mirnas, ta-sirnas and nat-sirnas in these two plants, particularly in cassava, in response to chilling stress and in the process of chilling acclimation.

RESULTS
experiments to explore chilling response and stress acclimation
the study of mirnas and endo-sirnas in cassava and castor bean was based on an integrative sncrna and mrna expression profiling experiment   <cit> . briefly, sc <dig>  which is sensitive to chilling and is a widely planted cassava cultivar in china, was subjected to three chilling stress treatments. the first was gradual chilling acclimation  at a moderate stress where plants were subjected to a temperature decrease from 24°c to 14°c by -2°c/h and then grew for five days. in the second treatment of chilling stress after chilling acclimation , plants after the ca treatment were transferred further from 14°c to 4°c by -2°c/h and cultivated for another 5 days. in the third experiment, plants were subjected to chilling shock  by a dramatic temperature drop from 24°c to 4°c with a gradient of -4°c/h. for comparison, plants grown under 24°c were taken as the normal control . it is important to note that the three chilling treatments resulted in distinct phenotypes of elevated leaf proline content and/or malondialdehyde content  <cit> .

sncrna and mrna expression profiling by next generation sequencing
four small-rna libraries from the chilling-treated  and the normal  plants of sc <dig> were prepared and sequenced separately using illumina genome analyzer iix  . these libraries contributed to more than  <dig>  million raw small-rna reads total, among which  <dig> , <dig>  were adapter-trimmed, high-quality reads . among the qualified reads,  <dig> % and  <dig> % could map to the cassava reference genome  allowing zero and one mismatch , respectively, indicating a high sequencing quality despite that sc <dig> is different cultivar from the reference genome am <dig>  the qualified and genome mapped reads had lengths peaked at 21-nt and 24-nt, and carried twice more u’s and a’s than g’s and c’s as the first nucleotides . in comparison, the reads from mirnas were dominantly 21-nt or 22-nt and carried preferentially u’s at the first nucleotides .

to appreciate the potential regulatory effects of sncrnas, four mrna libraries, which were prepared using the plants from the same three chilling treatments and the normal condition, were sequenced individually using the illumina rna-seq protocol . briefly, from more than 80% genome-mapped reads of more than  <dig>  million raw reads,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   mrna genes were expressed under the nc, ca, cca, and cs conditions, respectively . among the expressed genes were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in ac, cca and cs in reference to nc . these differentially expressed genes were further analyzed, in addition to sncrnas, in the study.

sncrna species expressed in cca treated and the normal castor bean plants were profiled following the same sequencing protocol as used for cassava. the sequencing data, which have similar percentage of qualified reads and reads mapped to the reference genome and similar distributions of length and first nucleotide bias as those of cassava, with one exception that mirnas were dominantly 21-nt long in castor bean .

novel mirnas in euphorbia and their conservation
novel mirnas
utilizing the sequencing data and a set of stringent criteria , we identified  <dig> and  <dig> novel mirnas in cassava and castor bean, respectively . alignments of novel mirna sequencing reads to the respective genomes are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  if a newly detected mirna has been reported in other plants, e.g., mir <dig>  the same family name was used; otherwise, a temporary new family name, e.g., novel- <dig>  was introduced. the same temporary family names were used for cassava and castor bean to indicate their conservation across the two species. for example, mes-novel- <dig> in cassava  and rco-novel- <dig> in castor bean  belong to the same mirna family. among these novel mirnas, four novel mirnas in cassava, novel- <dig>  novel- <dig>  novel- <dig>  and novel- <dig>  were highly represented as detected by sequencing reads . the sequence reads for these four mirnas counted for 6% of the total reads from cassava mirnas.table  <dig>

experimental validation and analysis of mirnas
we selected  <dig> known, newly reported and novel mirnas to validate and assess mirna’s expression under four conditions in sc <dig> with qualitative real-time rt-pcr  methods. as a result,  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas were detected in at least one of the four conditions, respectively . figure 1b shows examples of known and novel mirnas by qrt-pcr, and figure 1c displays the detailed experimental results on novel mirna novel- <dig> whose hairpin structure is shown in figure 1d.figure  <dig>

for known mirnas, the detected mirnas have a large number of reads , but mirnas that failed to be detected have smaller number of reads . for example, two mirna families , which had more than 7 k reads, can also be detected in qrt-pcr validation . similar to known mirnas, the detected novel mirnas had large numbers of reads , but undetected mirnas typically had small numbers of reads . mature mirnas may arise to an abundant level from both arms. for example, four mirnas , each of which had more than  <dig> reads, had their mature mirnas detected by qrt-pcr . taken together, mirnas with low numbers of sequencing reads were likely not to be detected by qrt-pcr, reflecting that deep sequencing was more sensitive to low abundant transcripts.

conservation of mirnas
the conservation of all known, newly identified and novel mirnas in cassava and castor bean was examined in reference to seven diverse plant species, i.e., populus, medicago, soy bean, arabidopsis, grapes, rice and moss  . eight known mirna families – mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> – were evolutionally conserved across the  <dig> species . another  <dig> annotated mirna families – mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> – were also conserved in at least eight species . the highly expressed report- <dig> had no homologs in castor bean and the other seven plants. the conservation of these mirnas is broad, ranging from the angiosperm lineages to vascular plants, suggesting their essential functions in plants  <cit> .

remarkably, most novel mirna families identified in the current study were euphorbia specific. in these mirna families, five  exist in both cassava and castor bean, while  <dig> and  <dig> novel mirnas were cassava and castor bean specific, respectively . among the highly expressed novel mirnas in cassava , three  had homologs in castor bean, though they did not appear in other plants beyond euphorbia. the existence of lineage/species specific mirnas in cassava and castor bean indicated some specific roles that these mirnas may play in stress response in euphorbiaceous plants.

microrna-triggered secondary sirnas
a genome-wide search of small rnas resembling secondary sirnas  resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> genomic loci enriched with 21-nt long in length in the small-rna libraries of cassava and castor bean, respectively . these genomic loci were targeted by  <dig> mirna families in cassava  and  <dig> mirna families in castor bean . the majority  of these sirna-generating genomic loci in cassava correspond to protein-coding genes . these genes fell into several classes. the first was the set of three loci corresponding to the tas <dig> genes, known hosts of ta-sirnas, despite that only one tas <dig> locus has been annotated in the current cassava reference genome  <cit> . the second and biggest class consisted of  <dig> nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance genes, which are receptors sensing intracellular perturbations  <cit> . the third class contained  <dig> auxin response factors and  <dig> auxin signaling f-box genes.table  <dig>

b. castor bean


many of these sirna-generating loci and their targeting mirna candidates were conserved in castor bean . as expected, the three tas <dig> loci and the targeting mirna ,  <dig> auxin response factors, and auxin signaling f-box genes were targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig> and two gras family transcription factors were targets of mir <dig>  such a strong conservation suggested some common regulatory functions of those sirna-yielding loci in euphorbiaceous plants.

ta-sirnas triggered by mir <dig> and novel tas <dig> genes
a genome-wide homologue search of tas genes in euphorbia concluded that tas <dig> and tas <dig> genes did not exist in the cassava and castor bean genomes. this is consistent with the fact that mir <dig>  which triggers ta-sirnas in homologies of tas <dig> and tas <dig> in arabidopsis, is not conserved in euphorbia  <cit> . tas <dig> did not seem to appear in cassava or castor bean either, although mir <dig>  the initiator of tas4-sirnas in arabidopsis, exists in cassava and castor bean  <cit> . one tas <dig> gene is currently annotated in the cassava reference genome . this is in sharp contrast with three tas <dig> genes in arabidopsis   <cit>  and four tas <dig> genes in p. patens   <cit> .

we identified two novel tas <dig> loci in both cassava and castor bean genomes by searching for a pair of mir- <dig> target sites . the currently annotated tas <dig> gene was thus named as tas3a and the two new tas <dig> genes as tas3b  and tas3c . importantly, a substantial number of sequencing reads, arranged in phasing, appeared in the regions defined by the two mir <dig> target sites . following the standard nomenclature  <cit> , the register of phased sirnas was named as d <dig>  d <dig>  and so on, starting from the 5′-end mirna target site, and the orientation was indicated by suffix “+” for the positive  strand, or “-” for the negative  strand.figure  <dig>

the two binding sites of mir <dig> on tas3c gene have a highly complementary sequence match . moreover, nearly perfect matches around the 10-nt from the 5′-end of mir <dig> binding sites suggested that both binding sites were cleaved, which were further supported by the phased sequencing reads starting at the position of the cleavage sites of both 5′- and 3′-end target sites . these two-cleavage sites have been reported for tas <dig> genes in p. patens
 <cit>  but different from that of arabidopsis tas3a where only the 3′-end target site is cleaved  <cit> . similar cleavage sites of mir <dig> on the tas3c gene appeared in castor bean .

interestingly, the regions between the two pairs of mir <dig> target sites on tas3c in the two euphorbiaceous species had the same length of 190-nt and shared a high sequence identity . the regions around the two target sites had almost identical sequences, suggesting a strong conservation on and near the mir <dig> target sites. importantly, sirna from d4+ register  was highly conserved with tasiarf, a well-studied ta-sirna targeting an arf gene in arabidopsis   <cit> . it is noteworthy that tas3a and tas3b also host tasiarf-like sirnas in euphorbia. however, sequence alignment revealed that there existed three distinct tasiarf-like sirna species encoded by tas3a/b/c; a slight sequence difference near the 3′-ends existed in the three tasiarfs . finally, the three tas <dig> genes encoded different numbers of tasiarf. tas3a and tas3b maintained two tasiarfs adjacent to each other , while tas3c contained a single tasiarf .

a total of  <dig>  reads from the small-rna libraries of cassava were mapped to the tas3c region, among which  <dig> % were 21-nt long. among these small rnas,  <dig>   were arranged in phase with reference to the putative cleavage site at either the 5′ or 3′ target site of mir <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> % of 21-nt small rnas have the first nucleotides at the positions shifted by ~10- or 11-nt from the majority phased small rnas. these shifted sirnas followed the phasing register set by sirna d8-, indicating that sirnas arising from d8- could target and cleave the original transcripts, setting a secondary phasing register different from the register set by mir <dig>  the most prominent example of such shifted sirnas was located at the middle of d5+ and d3- . similarly,  <dig>  sequencing reads, 81% of which were 21-nt long, were derived from tas3c in castor bean. secondary, shifted sirnas  were also observed , similar to that in cassava tas3c, exemplified by the peaks in the middle of d6+, d6- and d5-. taken together, tas3c in cassava and castor bean produced ample ta-sirnas, majority of which were arranged in 21-nt phasing, while a small amount of which had a register shifted half way from the main register.

candidate secondary sirnas triggered by mirnas
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> nbs-lrr genes are annotated in the current cassava and castor bean genomes, respectively  <cit> . however, only one castor bean nbs-lrr genes was predicted to be targeted by mir <dig> to produce enriched sirnas of 21-nt long . this is in contrast to the results in medicago and tomatoes, where a large number of nbs-lrr genes have been reported to be targeted by one or two mirna initiators, such as mir <dig>  <cit> . we were able to identify one locus encoding mir <dig> in cassava genome . however, mir <dig> in cassava was rarely sequenced in the current data sets , indicating that mir <dig> might not be expressed in the tissues we examined. alternatively, it is plausible that mir <dig> did not regulate nbs-lrr genes in euphorbiaceous species, which is consistent with the prediction that few nbs-lrr genes were targeted by mir <dig> in cassava or castor bean, respectively.

ta-sirnas at tas <dig> loci were found to be arranged in phasing. nevertheless, many other sirnas were not arranged in a precise 21-nt phasing pattern . for example, an unannotated genomic locus associated with report- <dig> produced  <dig>  sirna reads in total, 84% of which were 21-nt long , but interestingly, the sirnas were not arranged in phasing , different from the phasing pattern of sirnas from the tas <dig> loci. non-phasing ta-sirnas have also been observed in arabidopsis, where rdr6-dependent sirnas derived from mirna target loci  were found not to be arranged in a phasing pattern either  <cit> . therefore, we reported both phased and non-phased sirna candidates from mirna-targeted genes.

experimental validation of secondary sirnas and their targets
we experimentally validated three ta-sirnas including tasiarf1/ <dig> from tas3a/b genes and the highly sequenced d8+ sirna from the newly identified tas3c gene . the qrt-pcr result showed consistent amplification and sharp dissolution curves as well as clear bands of three sirnas, supporting the genuine presence of the three ta-sirnas .

further, to investigate the effect of sncrnas on target genes, we used 5′-race to assess the cleavage activities of mirnas and secondary sirnas of tas <dig> on their targets. the mirnas that we tested could indeed cleave their targets, as shown by the cleavage sites of mir <dig> on arf <dig> and that of mir <dig> on abf <dig> . the two putative cleavage sites of mir <dig> on tas3c were cleaved , in agreement with the reads from the rna-seq data . moreover, ta-sirnas of tas <dig> were also able to cleave their target genes. the subsequent secondary ta-sirnas – tasiarf <dig>  tasiarf <dig>  and tasiarf <dig> – cleaved their respective targets; specifically, tasiarf <dig> cleaved both arf <dig> and arf <dig>  tasiarf <dig> cleaved nac <dig> and tasiarf <dig> cleaved arf <dig> . interestingly, tasiarf <dig> and tasiarf <dig> degraded the same target  at the same cleavage site  with different cleavage efficiency  under the cs condition . moreover, one putative secondary sirna derived from report- <dig> initiated transcript, i.e., sireport- <dig>  was able to cleave its target gene, cul <dig>  note that some cleavage sites detected by 5′-race were separated by consecutive segments of 21-nt long, e.g., between the cleavages sites at 21-nt and 84-nt downstream from the tasiarf <dig> cleavage sites on arf <dig> .table  <dig>

candidate sirnas originated from natural antisense transcripts
following our method for identifying cis-nats and using the threshold of 25-nt overlapping  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> pairs of cis-nats were identified, respectively, in the cassava and castor bean reference genomes . among the  <dig> cis-nats in cassava,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  pairs were arranged in the convergent , divergent  and enclosed orientations, respectively . note that the percentage of enclosed cis-nats was greater than that in arabidopsis
 <cit> . in castor bean, the same number of  <dig> cis-nat pairs appeared in the enclosed and divergent categories and  <dig> were convergent .

seven and  <dig> cis-nat in cassava and castor bean, respectively, were detected to yield nat-sirnas, each of which gave rise to at least  <dig> reads in the overlapping region . one example of cis-nat-sirnas was from the cis-nat pair of two genes, 013132 m and 020539 m on scaffold <dig> , arranged in a convergent fashion ; a total of  <dig> reads aligned to the overlap region of the two genes. approximately 80% of the mappable reads appeared in the cis-nat overlapping region, showing that cis-nat-sirnas were predominantly derived from the overlapping region. transcription of the two nat genes were confirmed by expressed sequence tags  and directly supported by our rna-seq data of the cassava transcriptome profiling under the four conditions .table  <dig>

unlike mirnas, many of which are highly conserved in plants  <cit> , the majority plant cis-nat-sirnas are not conserved  <cit> . interestingly, one cis-nat pair detected in cassava  was conserved in arabidopsis , which overlap by ~700-nt in the 3′-3′ orientation based on the arabidopsis gene and est annotation . a few small rnas, 85% of which were 21-nt long, arise from the cis-nat region in chilling-stressed arabidopsis shoots  <cit> . in addition, castor bean genome appeared to have one homologous gene of at1g <dig> but no homologous gene for at1g <dig> that was essential for generating cis-nat <dig> .

perturbed sncrnas in response to chilling stress and acclimation
a substantial number of mirnas were de under the chilling stresses with respect to the normal control and were de across different stress conditions. among the  <dig>  mirnas expressed in cassava,  <dig>  had at least  <dig> -fold change under one of the six comparisons . fifteen de mirnas were further experimentally analyzed . note that the mir <dig> and mir <dig> families are well conserved in plants, and mir <dig> is conserved in populus, arabidopsis, grape vine and moss , suggesting their conserved function in plant stress response. as for the novel chilling-responsive, highly de cassava mirnas, three  were up-regulated and one  were down-regulated across the chilling treatments. three novel mirnas  were not differentially expressed in the three chilling treatments in sc <dig> cultivar. in contrast, the four mirnas were all highly up-regulated at 4°c under both cca and cs of the c <dig> cultivar , a more chilling tolerance cultivar. consistently, the expression patterns of novel- <dig> and novel-55-5p were significantly differentially expressed in the three chilling stresses with respect to the control condition, i.e., one was up-regulated and one down-regulated in the ca condition, while both were up-regulated under the cca and cs conditions .figure  <dig>

the  <dig> putative sirna-yielding loci in cassava were further assessed across six comparisons for their potential for producing differentially expressed sirnas. in the loci analyzed,  <dig>  of the  <dig> loci exhibited differential expression with at least 2-fold change under at least one of the six comparisons . the mirnas that initiated sirnas were highly induced in all three chilling stress conditions compared to nc . mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were also differentially expressed under chilling stress; mir <dig> was up-regulated under ca while mir <dig> was up-regulated under cca in reference to the normal condition. some of the ta-sirnas from tas <dig> were validated under the four chilling treatments using qrt-pcr. tasiarf- <dig> and d8+ were down-regulated under the cca vs nc condition , indicating that special function of the ta-sirnas might take part when cassava was transferred from 14°c to 4°c.

the targets of differentially expressed mirnas and sirnas are of special interest, particularly those that have expression patterns that are anti-correlated with that of their regulatory, differentially expressed sirnas because such relationships provide information of sirnas’ potential regulatory function. a total of  <dig> putative targets were recognized to have expression patterns that are anti-correlated with that of differentially expressed targeting sirnas in the six comparisons considered . among the anti-correlated pairs of sirnas and their targets, many were related to genes involved in chilling-stress and chilling-acclimated response. for example, sirnas derived from the auxin signaling f-box  <dig> gene  was down-regulated in the ca condition with respect to nc and the host geneafb <dig> was also down-regulated in ca vs. nc conditions, as determined by rna-seq signals. it has been reported that f-box protein-encoding genes respond to chilling stress in rice  <cit> , leading to changes in gene expression. more importantly, sirnas from afb <dig> were found to target an amino acid permease gene  that was highly up-regulated  in the ca vs nc condition based on rna-seq profiling. the amino acid permease gene, which functions in amino acid translocation, has been found to be up-regulated in leaves of citrus unshiu when it is fully acclimated after exposure to the chilling. the up-regulated level of the amino acid permease in c. unshiu indicates that active transport and metabolism of amino acids are necessary under low temperature conditions, and the roles of the protein has been found to be related to chilling acclimation  <cit> .

while cis-nat-sirnas from one strand are expected to regulate the gene on the antisense strand of a nat pair, the differential expression of cis-nat-sirnas may lead to the anti-correlated expression of their targets  <cit> . two of the seven cis-nat-sirnas were differentially expressed with at least 2-fold changes in at least one of the six comparisons that we considered . one of these cis-nats was a gene  that was annotated as a nac domain transcriptional regulator superfamily protein. nac proteins have been implicated to participate in a wide range of plant developmental processes. numerous nac domain proteins have also been implicated in plant abiotic stress responses such as drought and chilling shock response  <cit> .

discussion
plant mirnas are associated with a variety of biological processes including development and stress responses  <cit> . cold inducible mirnas have been recently studied in variety of plant model species including a. thaliana, o. sativa  and t. aestivum  . the results obtained so far showed that mirnas play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to chilling stress. the results from the current deep-sequencing based study of two euphorbia’s species further supported the roles of mirna in gene regulation upon chilling stress. not only mirnas but also tasiarfs were found to be differentially expressed in chilling-stressed condition, indicating a perturbed small rna system that is potentially associated with the widely altered transcriptome. as a caveat, additional experiments were required to confirm the results from the rna-seq data.

identification of mirnas and sirnas in cassava and castor bean
in addition to an initial set of cassava mirnas we identified  <cit> , a substantial number of mirnas has been reported recently, based on deep-sequencing based profiling or computational prediction . nevertheless, we were able to identify  <dig> novel mirnas in cassava in the current study. importantly, three novel mirnas were highly expressed , indicating their important function in cassava. furthermore, we used qrt-pcr to validate  <dig> of the mirnas that were computationally predicted in previous studies  <cit>  . we also examined the rest of the candidate mirnas reported in  <cit> ; however, only a few passed our mirna identification criteria . we thus expect the total number of mirnas in cassava to be close to what we report here, whereas the previous study has inflated the number of mirnas in cassava.

here, we identified three tas <dig> paralogs in both cassava and castor bean genomes. while tas3a is indicated in  <cit> , tas3b and tas3c were newly identified in the two genomes in the current study. tas3c encodes different tasi-arf sirnas from tas3a and tas3b, and is well conserved in cassava and castor bean . a careful examination of ta-sirnas and cis-nats reported in the previous study  <cit>  showed that the candidates satisfy neither of the two criteria: 1) the enrichment of 21-nt reads within a candidate locus; 2) unique mapping to the candidate locus.

differentially expressed sncrna and auxin response under chilling stress
a recurring theme from our sncrna profiling and analysis was the set of auxin response genes. for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were reported to be dysregulated in cassava of the current study and a. thaliana and wheat  <cit> . more importantly, mir <dig> has been reported to target auxin response factors, important transcription factors that regulate auxin response genes. besides, dysregulated mir <dig> targets auxin signaling f-box, an important auxin receptor gene in the auxin signaling pathway. mir <dig> has been reported to target growth regulating factors , known transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . moreover, in a. thaliana, mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been implicated in regulating a set of targets involved in stress which have enriched functions of vascular development and growth  <cit> . the common theme of these chilling-responsive mirnas is the regulation of auxin response and growth regulating genes, which are central players of many important aspects of plant growth and development as well as response to environmental stresses .

for ta-sirnas, tasiarfs are well known to target auxin response factors in a wide variety of plant species. tasiarfs are derived from well-conserved tas <dig> genes targeted by mir <dig> in plants. as expected, three tas <dig> loci and the targeting mirna, i.e., mir <dig>  were found to be conserved in cassava and castor bean. not only did mirnas target auxin response factors, e.g., mir <dig> targeted arf <dig>  but secondary tasi-arfs originating from the three tas <dig> genes targeted auxin response factors as well, e.g., tasiarf <dig> and tasiarf <dig> targeted arf <dig>  . we showed that tasiarf <dig> also targeted auxin response factor  <dig> . overall, most validated target genes of sirnas were related to receptors of auxin signaling, transcription factors and down-stream receptor of auxin related genes . besides, mir393-mediated auxin signaling f-box  genes in arabidopsis and our current study on cassava can further produce sirnas, which potentially carry out a self regulation on afb genes  <cit> . taken together, both dysregulated mirnas and sirnas triggered by mirnas regulate auxin-related genes, reflecting the robustness and plasticity of small rna-mediated gene expression regulation.

auxin is intimately involved in differential growth and bending. for example, root gravitropic curvature is driven by an asymmetric distribution of auxin response pathway  <cit> . under a biotic stress, repressing of auxin signaling by mir <dig> has been shown to contribute to antibacterial resistance to p. syringae in arabidopsis
 <cit> . under an abitoic stress, it has been shown that chilling stress affects the polar transport of auxin by selective inhibition of intracellular trafficking of auxin efflux carriers  <cit> . the abnormal auxin among cell, shoot or root and other developmental organs might result in the abnormal development during chilling stress, such as growth retardation, reproduction attenuation and a lack of common survival symptoms observed during chilling attack. regulation of various factors by mirnas in the auxin signaling pathway may indicate a conserved role of mirnas in response to abiotic and biotic stress.

cold-responsive mirnas regulate other important cellular processes in response to chilling stress
in the companion publication  <cit> , we identified a large number of anti-correlated pairs of differentially expressed mirnas and de mrnas. the transcriptome analysis has shown that perturbations of small rnas as well as variations of transcriptome were most prominent in the cs condition. mirna-mediated targets were enriched in biosynthetic process, cellular protein modification process, response to stress and metabolic process, consistent with the results from another recent study of cassava chilling-stressed transcriptome  <cit> . particularly, multiple genes in the same enriched processes were regulated by mirnas under multiple stress conditions. for example,  <dig> genes  targeted by mir <dig> function in the same biosynthetic process in ca vs. nc. one gene  was involved in oxidation-reduction process and  <dig> genes  in metabolic process under cca vs. nc, which were potentially targeted by mir396a/b/c/d . surprisingly, one translation-related gene  regulated by mir <dig> was differentially expressed in four comparisons: ca vs. nc, cs vs. nc, cca vs. ca and cs vs. cca. the regulatory roles of mir <dig> in ca and cs, but not in nc and cca, may indicate that chilling-acclimated cassava may reduce energy expense during chilling acclimation and depend on reserved nutrients to combat the adverse effects of chilling stress. in short, mirnas are indispensable regulating factors for low temperature adaptation in cassava.

secondary sirnas from disease-related genes
the current study indicated that the majority of secondary sirna-generating genomic loci correspond to conserved protein-coding genes in cassava and castor bean. recent studies have also revealed that a large number of secondary sirnas, arranged in phasing as ta-sirnas, arise from disease resistance nbs-lrr-encoding genes initiated by mirna binding. in this scenario, several master mirnas regulate a large number of genes in the nbs-lrr gene family. for example, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> in medicago target more than  <dig> nb-lrr-encoding genes to subsequently produce ample sirnas  <cit> . such a sirna-yielding phenomenon has also been observed in a. thaliana and s. lycopersicum  . moreover, different plant species utilize different mirnas to target genes in the same classes  for sirna production. for example, sly-mir <dig> and sly-mir <dig> in tomato and ath-mir <dig> and ath-mir <dig> in arabidopsis all target a large number of nbs-lrr genes.

in addition, cassava mir <dig> targeted dicer-like  <dig> protein and initiated a small amount of sirnas, which is consistent with the observation in arabidopsis
 <cit> . remarkably, a large number of mirna-medicated sirna-generating loci belong to the coding regions of genes of immune and stress response functions, particularly those disease resistant genes containing the nb-arc domain. taken together, a broadly conserved mechanism exists between mirnas and their target genes in plants; moreover, secondary sirnas that are derived from the target genes can accumulate to a prominent level, indicating their important function in plants

natural-antisense sirnas
endo-sirnas derived from cis-nats have been widely reported in animal and plants. in arabidopsis, nat-sirnas from the sro <dig> and p5cdh gene pair is induced by salt stress  <cit> . p5cdh is known as a stress-related gene while the function of sro <dig> remains unknown  <cit> . other nat-sirnas from atgb <dig> and ppr only accumulates in response to a bacterial pathogen infection. in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , genome-wide analysis of nat-sirnas further suggested that the accumulation of many nat-sirnas is condition-specific . therefore, chilling acclimation and chilling shock were anticipated to induce nat-sirnas to negate the damage caused by the stress. in the current study, we identified several candidate cis-nat-sirna loci which yield a few number of small rna reads only within the overlapping regions. one of the cis-nat-sirnas was further found to be differentially expressed under chilling stress compared to the normal condition.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provided the first results on gene regulation by sncrnas in chilling acclimation of euphorbiaceous plants. we identified  <dig>  novel mirnas as well as  <dig>  putative secondary sirna-yielding and  <dig>  nat-sirna-yielding candidate loci in cassava and castor bean, respectively. we showed above three sncrna species and mrna genes in euphorbiaceous plants experienced dramatic change, especially auxin response genes, after severe and moderate chilling stresses. this work laid a foundation to elucidate further function of those sncrna-mediated pathways during chilling stress and acclimation in cassava.
