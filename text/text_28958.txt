BACKGROUND
prenatal development of skeletal muscle, myogenesis, is an ideal model to study cell determination and differentiation. accordingly myogenesis has become an extensively studied process in model animals  <cit> . because muscle regeneration resembles myogenesis the study of myogenesis provides basic knowledge for the development of therapies to treat human muscle disease  <cit> . in farm animal biology the interest in myogenesis is driven mainly by the perception that muscle growth potential is associated with muscle fiber number and muscle structure, i.e. with characteristics that are determined prenatally during myogenesis  <cit> . the relationship between muscle mass and muscle fiber number as well as muscle structure is well illustrated by the observation that domestic pigs selected for muscularity exhibit a higher number of myofibers and an increased proportion of fast twitch glycolytic fibers  compared to their wild ancestor or unimproved breeds  <cit> . morphological studies of myogenesis in the pig are scarce. development of somites takes place approximately between day  <dig> and  <dig> of gestation. around day  <dig> of gestation the formation of primary myotubes starts and proceeds until around day  <dig>  the secondary population of myotubes appears around day  <dig>  on the surface of the primary myotubes, which they use as a scaffold. the number of secondary myotubes increases several fold until day  <dig>  afterwards the number increases only slightly. around days 85â€“ <dig> the fiber formation ceases and the total number of fibers is established. the process of maturation of the myotubes into myofibers is finished in the early postnatal period  <cit> . in the pig, primary myotubes are a minor constituent of muscle fibers. in adult muscle, the ratio of primary to secondary myotubes is about 1: <dig>  however, both populations of myotubes significantly influence fiber number and consequently muscle size. the importance of both primary and secondary myotubes for muscle growth is underscored by the lower number of primary fibers and a lower secondary to primary fiber ratio in small compared to large pig breeds  <cit> .

knowledge of genetic and epigenetic factors that govern formation of both generations of myotubes will facilitate the understanding of the control of muscle growth and structure. application of transcriptome profiling technologies largely enhances our knowledge of these factors and facilitates uncovering the myogenic gene networks. so far transcriptome profiling of myogenesis in livestock was performed using macroarrays  <cit>  or application specific microarrays  <cit> . however, only a limited number of specified genes could be analyzed using these methodologies.

in the present study we employed a complementary methodology, differential display rt-pcr, as an open system that facilitates the identification and the analysis of yet unknown transcripts. we analyzed myogenesis in two breeds differing in muscularity and muscle structure: the pietrain breed with higher muscularity, higher number of muscle fibers and a higher proportion of glycolytic muscle fibers and the duroc breed with lower muscularity and higher proportion of slow twitch muscle fibers  <cit> . the aim of this study was the identification of genes and pathways whose expression profile during development of porcine skeletal muscle implicates their involvement in myogenesis. in addition genes that were found to be differentially expressed between pietrain and duroc represent candidate genes with potential impact on muscle growth and structure.

RESULTS
differential display rt-pcr profiling of the transcriptome during porcine myogenesis
comparison of a total of  <dig> differential display profiles between stages and between breeds revealed  <dig> cdna fragments differing in their presence and/or in their intensity. out of these,  <dig> cdna fragments showed similar stage-associated differences in the expression in both breeds and  <dig> fragments were differentially displayed between breeds. though the essentially binary expression patterns and the inefficient and tedious cloning of the differentially displayed cdna fragments hamper a global view of the expression changes and a comprehensive pathway analysis, we attempted to assign cdna fragments to groups based on their expression patterns and to relate these to functional pathways. stage-associated cdna fragments were classified into five groups of patterns  according to their distribution and/or changes in the intensity between the stages. the first group is related to early development . the second and third groups are related to the first wave  and the second wave  of myogenesis respectively. the fourth group included fragments present at both first and the second wave of myogenesis . the fifth group contained fragments present at all  <dig> stages that showed either steady up- or downregulation . in order to perform a similar grouping of the breed-associated cdna fragments according to their temporal expression across stages one such fragment was called present at a particular stage if it was present in one of the two breeds .

reamplification, cloning and sequencing was successfully performed for  <dig> breed- and  <dig> stage-associated cdna fragments . two breed-associated and four stage-associated differential display bands were found to represent multiple  different cdna fragments of nearly identical length. the sequences of the cdna fragments br21d <dig> and br10d <dig> were embedded in the larger est bs19c <dig> and qr10d <dig>  respectively, thus in total  <dig> unique est  were generated . homology search revealed that  <dig> est represented known genes,  <dig> est showed similarity to other anonymous est/cdna in the database,  <dig> est showed similarity to genomic clones,  <dig> est were homologous to mitochondrial dna  and  <dig> est did not match any database entries. the malat <dig> gene was represented by two different est representing cdna fragments with similar expression patterns . taking advantage of the high homology between pig and human sequences, we could assign  <dig> est similar to anonymous est/cdna and  <dig> est with genome hits to gene loci by blast search of the human genome. in total  <dig> est were assigned to  <dig> genes.

the most frequent functional categories represented genes encoding myofibrillar genes , genes involved in cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling and extracellular matrix synthesis/remodeling , genes regulating gene expression  and metabolism genes . the myofibrillar genes and genes involved in cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling and extracellular matrix synthesis/remodeling were almost exclusively represented in the period  <dig> group .

another functional group enriched in the period  <dig> group were cytoskeletal genes related to assembly of actin filaments . the remaining functional groups showed no obvious enrichment in a specific period group.

regarding the breed-associated cdna fragments,  <dig> were present/more intense in pietrain and  <dig> were present/more intense in duroc . genes related to cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling and extracellular matrix synthesis/remodeling and those from period group  <dig> tended to be enriched among the pietrain differentials and genes related to metabolism and those from period group  <dig> tended to be enriched among the duroc differentials.

analysis of expression profiles of reference genes
the use of reference genes for normalization of real-time quantitative pcr  data requires identification of genes which show constant expression under given experimental conditions. we analyzed expression profile of five potential reference genes, three  widely used and described  <cit> , and two  showing stable expression in microarray studies comparing expression signatures of different tissues and/or developmental stages  <cit> . not unexpectedly, considering the major changes in the cell type composition and the structure of the tissue samples, none of the five genes turned out to be expressed at constant levels across the seven prenatal stages . expression of actb, polr2a, canx showed steady downregulation from  <dig> dpc onwards, whereas expression of rpl <dig> and agpat <dig> peaked at  <dig> dpc and was downregulated thereafter. all three reference genes analyzed in adult muscle  were downregulated compared to prenatal stages. therefore we calculated a normalization factor based on the five reference genes  within stages, thus accounting for technical variation between breeds but not between stages.

validation of stage- and/or breed-associated differential expression of individual genes
in previous expression studies performed in our laboratory using differential display rt-pcr the incidence of false positives was low with about 23%  <cit> , however, in other studies employing differential display rt-pcr the rate of false positives reached as much as ~80% in some cases  <cit> . therefore expression patterns of thirteen genes showing stage- and/or breed-associated differential expression were validated by qpcr. we focused the validation mainly on the breed-associated genes because they represent primary candidates for finding the source of variation in muscularity and meat quality in pigs. all genes were selected so that  different expression patterns and/or  different functional pathways were represented.

three stage-associated genes, namely nme, igsf <dig> and hmga, were validated.

expression of nme <dig> showed steady downregulation from  <dig> dpc onward .

expression of igsf <dig> was low/absent at  <dig> dpc, increased dramatically until  <dig> dpc, stayed at similar level until  <dig> dpc and was downregulated in adult muscle nearly to the starting level at  <dig> dpc . at all stages the differences in expression of nme <dig> and igsf <dig> between pietrain and duroc were lower than twofold.

expression of hmga <dig> was barely detectable at  <dig> dpc, reached maximum at 21â€“ <dig> dpc, decreased substantially at  <dig> dpc, stayed at similar low level until  <dig> dpc and was essentially shut down in adult muscle . the sensitive qpcr revealed a ~ <dig> -fold higher expression of hmga <dig> in pietrain at  <dig> dpc, not detected by differential display rt-pcr.

the expression patterns of ten breed-associated genes and est were validated.

expression of gata <dig> as revealed by qpcr was highest at  <dig> dpc . at  <dig> dpc the expression decreased, with more pronounced downregulation in duroc embryos. in agreement with the results of differential display rt-pcr the expression lasted in duroc embryos/fetuses until  <dig> dpc whereas in pietrain embryos/fetuses the expression ceased already at  <dig> dpc.

the est br24d <dig>  that was found in duroc from  <dig> dpc onward only, was homologous to intron  <dig> of the spp <dig> gene. since we used total rna for differential display rt-pcr we reasoned that this est was derived from heteronuclear rna  and thereby reflected higher active transcription of spp <dig> in duroc. qpcr using exon specific primers showed that expression of spp <dig> peaked at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, i.e. at the time-points of the two myogenic waves, and confirmed consistently higher expression of spp <dig> in duroc at all seven prenatal stages . the difference was highest at  <dig> dpc , afterwards gradually decreased until  <dig> dpc  and remained at similar magnitude until  <dig> dpc. in adult muscle no differences were found.

the smc6l <dig> gene was expressed throughout myogenesis as shown consistently by both, differential display rt-pcr and qpcr . qpcr revealed more than twofold upregulation of smc6l <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc in pietrain in agreement with differential display rt-pcr and additionally at  <dig> dpc, but no difference was found at  <dig> dpc.

for the remaining breed-associated est/genes no clear relationship between profiles obtained using differential display rt-pcr and qpcr respectively could be established.

the expression profile of rab6ip <dig> showed two peaks, one higher at 21â€“ <dig> dpc and another at  <dig> dpc, i.e. at the onset of the two waves of myofiber formation. expression of rab6ip <dig> was consistently upregulated  throughout myogenesis in pietrain compared to duroc with the most pronounced differences at 35â€“ <dig> dpc .

the expression pattern of the est br22b <dig>  homologous to pdgfra, obtained by differential display rt-pcr suggested upregulation of pdgfra in duroc compared to pietrain embryos/fetuses. indeed such upregulation was found by qpcr at all stages but  <dig> and  <dig> dpc when the situation was reversed . the  <dig> â€“ <dig> -fold upregulation of pdgfra detected by qpcr in duroc correlated poorly with the results of differential display rt-pcr. however, qpcr revealed a striking difference in the expression pattern between pietrain and duroc. in pietrain the expression of pdgfra gene showed a peak at  <dig> dpc whereas in duroc two peaks existed, one at  <dig> dpc and another at  <dig> dpc.

for tjp <dig> both, differential display rt-pcr and qpcr indicated upregulation  at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc in pietrain compared to duroc . no difference at  <dig> dpc could be shown by qpcr. the expression of tjp <dig> was highest at  <dig> dpc and in duroc continuously decreased until  <dig> dpc. in pietrain a small peak at  <dig> dpc was observed. from  <dig> dpc onward the expression stayed at a similar level until  <dig> dpc in both breeds.

the expression profile of lxn as revealed by qpcr  was similar to the expression profiles of rpl <dig> and agpat <dig> . the differences in the expression of lxn between breeds were less than twofold, but especially in the early stages 21â€“ <dig> dpc the expression was consistently higher in pietrain.

the expression of nrap, as revealed by qpcr, was barely detectable at  <dig> dpc and continuously increased in the developing muscle until adult age . at  <dig> dpc the expression of nrap was ~2-fold higher in pietrain compared to duroc fetuses.

the expression profile of the est qr15c <dig> obtained using qpcr resembled those of the hmga <dig> gene . a peak was observed at 21â€“ <dig> dpc and from day  <dig> dpc onward the expression was maintained at low level; in pietrain about 2â€“4-fold higher compared to duroc. in adult muscle the expression was essentially switched off. the temporal expression profile of the est qr15c <dig> indicated that the transcript might be involved in early development. unfortunately, the sequence of qr15c <dig> was very short and showed no similarity with transcripts of known genes. we took advantage of the ongoing sequencing of the porcine genome and retrieved a trace sequence  overlapping the est. using this trace we were able to map the est qr15c <dig> to intron  <dig> of the human kinesin family member 26b  gene . thus qr15c <dig> may represent a so far undetected exon of kif26b.

sequencing of the two comigrating cdna fragments br10d <dig> and qr10d <dig> revealed that they represent the same transcript differing only in a  <dig> bp insertion/deletion and that the differences between breeds obtained using differential display rt-pcr were based on different frequencies of the insertion/deletion in duroc and pietrain. nevertheless qpcr revealed that besides allelic variation the transcript represented by the est br10d1/qr10d <dig> differed also in its abundance between the two breeds . in the early duroc embryos at  <dig> dpc the expression was about 4-fold higher compared to pietrain and the situation was reversed during the first wave of myogenesis at 21â€“ <dig> dpc, when the expression was about  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold higher in pietrain embryos/fetuses. the expression profile was very similar to that of spp <dig>  i.e. it peaked at  <dig> dpc and  <dig> dpc respectively.

taken together, qpcr confirmed the differential display rt-pcr derived expression patterns for all three genes showing stage-associated differential expression and three out of ten genes with breed-associated differential expression . furthermore, five of the seven breed-associated genes, whose differential display expression pattern could not be reflected in detail by qpcr, showed more than twofold differences in expression between breeds on at least one stage.

discussion
identification of genes/networks expressed during skeletal muscle development in pigs
myogenesis in mammals is a multistep process that involves commitment of pluripotent mesodermal cells in somites to the myogenic lineage, followed by proliferation/migration of myoblasts and two waves of myoblast fusion resulting in the formation of two morphologically/functionally distinct types of myotubes.

in the present study we performed expression profiling of skeletal muscle development in the pig using embryonic and fetal musculus longissimus dorsi tissue at seven stages covering the whole myogenesis from somitogenesis to maturation of the myotubes into myofibers. recently te pas et al  <cit>  reported results of a similar study analyzing the same breeds and developmental stages using an application specific microarray focused on genes related to myogenic regulatory factors, energy metabolism and structural genes. here we provide complementary data generated using differential display rt-pcr as a hypothesis free, open system. we identified  <dig> transcripts expressed at one or more of these key stages, evidencing their potential involvement in myogenesis. these transcripts represented  <dig> genes from various functional classes and  <dig> anonymous est. several of them were either not yet cloned in the pig , or are completely novel . the identified genes and networks and their relationship with myogenesis are discussed below.

at early developmental stages  it was not feasible to dissect structures giving rise to muscle and so expression profiles of some of the transcripts may have been influenced by the heterogeneous and changing cellular composition. for ~50% of the transcripts the expression profiles derived by differential display rt-pcr and qpcr are not fully compatible. in the case of stage-associated est/genes the consistency of expression patterns in both breeds provides biological replication and thus underscores the reproducibility of the results. on the other hand, the differences in differential display rt-pcr and qpcr profiles of breed-associated est/genes, especially of those displayed in binary fashion, may have resulted from different sensitivity of the two methods  and polymorphisms in some of the est . because for qpcr very short amplicons are usually designed to achieve high amplification efficiency it is also possible that in some cases the differential display cdna fragment and the qpcr amplicon represented different splice forms of the same gene and thus show different profiles.

the differential display patterns revealed on average some  <dig> bands representing either genes with stage- and/or breed-specific expression that were further assigned to groups according to their temporal expression pattern and to categories of biological functions. a subset of genes representing these categories was analysed further by qpcr. these are discussed in the following paragraphs.

genes involved in the regulation of transcription
members of the myogenic regulatory factor  and myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  families of transcription factors play a central role in the regulation of myogenic determination and differentiation; however, their expression during porcine myogenesis changes only marginally  <cit> . recently blais et al  <cit>  identified an extensive network of genes regulating transcription and chromatin architecture that propagate and amplify the myogenic signal initiated by the mrfs in vitro. among the genes we identified, those regulating transcription represented one of the most abundantly detected functional classes, underscoring the important role of transcriptional regulation in the control of myogenesis. for the majority of genes identified, their precise role in this process is largely unknown, but because they were expressed in various 'period' groups they probably have diverse functions. the architectural transcription factor hmga <dig>  for example, was recently shown to promote myogenic differentiation in vitro  <cit> . however, the est bs3d <dig> does not show homology to known cdna sequence of hmga <dig> but to a sequence segment in the intron  <dig> of the human hmga <dig> , that was shown to be transcribed in uterine leiomas. thus, est bs3d <dig> probably represents a novel exon of porcine hmga <dig>  several studies in humans point to the existence of alternative exons in intron  <dig> of hmga <dig> with a complex splicing pattern  <cit> . the porcine est harbours sequence features that support the hypothesis of an alternative exon â€“ an open reading frame  with a stop codon, a polyadenylation signal and a poly-a tail. expression of this exon would generate a hmga <dig> protein with a truncated c-terminal region and lacking the acidic tail. intriguingly, overexpression of a carboxyl-terminally truncated hmga <dig> form in embryonic stem  cells resulted in enhanced myogenic differentiation compared to wild type hmga <dig> cells  <cit> . thus the putative novel exon of porcine hmga <dig> may play a specific function in myogenesis.

another gene of this functional class, rab6ip <dig>  showed consistent upregulation at all seven stages in pietrain compared to duroc samples. the function of rab6ip <dig> is poorly understood. recently, sigala et al  <cit>  proposed rab6ip <dig> as a part of the ikappab kinase complex, involved in activation of the transcription factor nf-kappab. nf-kappab in turn inhibits myogenic differentiation and stimulates proliferation of myoblasts by activation of cyclin d <dig> transcription and suppression of myod  <cit> . hence upregulation of rab6ip <dig> may be an indicator for delayed myogenic differentiation via nf-kappab in pietrain.

genes involved in the control of cell proliferation
proliferation of myoblasts is stimulated by a variety of secreted peptide growth factors including insulin-like growth factors  and platelet derived growth factors . these usually have reverse effect on myogenic differentiation with the exception of igfs that stimulate both proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts  <cit> . we found a new and largely uncharacterized member of the igf system, igfbpl <dig>  among genes expressed during the first wave of myogenesis. the igf binding proteins  serve as modulators of the effects of igfs. igfbpl <dig> shows structural and functional similarity to igfbp <dig>  <cit> , that specifies the proliferative response to igfs in myogenesis  <cit> . taken together the expression pattern and similarity to igfbp <dig> it implies that igfbpl <dig> may also serve as a factor stimulating proliferation and/or inhibiting differentiation of embryonic myoblasts.

the expression profile of pdgfra showed distinct differences between pietrain and duroc at early stages of myogenesis, with pietrain showing a more pronounced but delayed peak. pdgfra plays a vital role in the early myogenesis as evidenced by the pdgfra null mouse showing impaired myotome formation  <cit>  and  complete absence of muscles of the back  <cit> .

cell adhesion and extracellular matrix genes
signals generated by adhesive interactions between myoblasts and between myoblasts and the extracellular matrix represent another essential part of the molecular network governing myogenic differentiation besides secreted factors and transcription factors  <cit> . furthermore, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules serve a structural role in myoblast fusion and migration, and provide physical support for the developing myofibers. consistently, genes involved in cell adhesion, cell-cell signaling, and extracellular matrix synthesis and remodeling were abundantly represented and were enriched in the period  <dig> group, i.e. they were expressed from 21â€“ <dig> dpc onward. several of these, like igsf <dig>  were not yet associated with myogenesis. igsf <dig> encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily  of cell surface proteins mediating cell adhesion and recognition. diverse igsf members have been implicated in cell-contact-based regulation of myogenesis  <cit> . the increasing expression of igsf <dig> towards later stages suggests that it might be involved in the second wave of myogenesis.

expression of spp <dig> shows a more regulated profile with peaks at the two respective myogenic waves and consistent upregulation in duroc compared to pietrain, especially at the early stages. spp <dig> is multifunctional matricellular protein mediating cell-adhesion and cellular signaling via integrin and cd <dig> receptors. several lines of evidence indicate that spp <dig> is involved in myogenesis. spp <dig> is a target of myod and myf <dig>  <cit>  and was shown to be expressed in vitro in myoblasts and myotubes, with higher levels in the later  <cit> . moreover spp <dig> is downregulated in the bc3h <dig> cell line, which is myogenic but do not terminally differentiate, compared to the myogenic c2c <dig> cell line, which differentiate normally  <cit> . considering our in vivo and the in vitro evidences for an association between spp <dig> expression and myogenic differentiation it appears that upregulation of spp <dig> in duroc may be a sign of accelerated myogenesis in this breed compared to pietrain.

differential gene expression as an indicator of cellular reorganization during myogenesis
the abundantly identified myofibrillar, cytoskeletal, and metabolism genes are indicators of the massive structural and functional remodeling occurring during the development of skeletal muscle at the cellular level, including for example formation of the contractile apparatus. another indicator of the ongoing reorganization of cell and tissue architecture might be the expression of the autophagy genes atg <dig> and uvrag that we detected during the first and second wave of myogenesis, respectively. autophagy is a process of bulk degradation of cytoplasmatic components that occurs in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms and in multiple different cell types during nutrient and growth factor deprivation, cellular and tissue remodeling, and cell death. the importance of autophagy for normal development is emphasized by frequent observation of dysregulation of autophagy in cancer  <cit> . to our best knowledge there are no reports describing autophagy and its exact role during myogenesis.

novel transcripts
of the  <dig> est generated,  <dig>  showed no appreciable similarity to transcripts of known genes. remarkably, these est were enriched among the breed-associated cdna-fragments. this finding may indicate that these est represent alternative exons with specific temporo-spatial expression, whose alternative usage may generate transcript diversity and ultimately phenotypic  diversity  <cit> . the expression profiles of several of these est suggest involvement of the corresponding genes in myogenesis or prenatal development in general. one interesting example is the est qr15c <dig>  whose expression is upregulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc. the est qr15c <dig> probably represents a novel exon of kif26b since comparative genome analysis showed similarity to intron  <dig> of the human ortholog. moreover, kif26b showed a similar expression profile as it is preferentially expressed in limb buds and, most notably, in the precursors of hypaxial muscles in somites of mouse embryos  <cit> .

implications for the understanding of the genetic control of muscle growth
genetic and epigenetic factors controlling proliferation, differentiation and cell death affect the number of myoblasts available for myofiber formation and thus are important determinants of muscle growth. we identified several novel genes that may be involved in these processes, e.g. igfbpl <dig>  during myogenesis. particularly interesting are those genes that show differential expression between the two breeds differing in muscularity. taken together, the breed-associated differences in the expression of rab6ip <dig>  pdgfra and spp <dig> suggest that myogenesis is delayed especially during the first wave in pietrain, the more muscular of the two breeds, allowing the generation of a larger pool of muscle precursor cells. this finding is in accordance with results of te pas et al  <cit> , who found that myogenesis genes show lower expression in pietrain compared to duroc at early stages, probably delaying formation of primary myotubes. the number and size of primary myotubes are intrinsic factors affecting secondary fiber number. in contrast to secondary myotubes, whose number is sensitive to exogenous factors, e.g. nutrition, the number of primary myotubes is genetically programmed  <cit> . thus genetic selection may impinge on the first wave of myogenesis, promoting genes active at this stage as primary candidates for manipulation of muscle growth.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study revealed several genes differentially expressed during skeletal muscle development of domestic pig that were not yet associated with myogenesis and thus provide novel insights into molecular pathways employed in mammalian myogenesis  and a foundation for future functional studies. genes that exhibited differences between the divergent breeds represent candidate genes for muscle growth and structure. indeed several of the identified genes map to known porcine qtl regions affecting muscle growth and/or structure and their dna variation is associated with variation in traits related to muscle deposition  <cit> .
