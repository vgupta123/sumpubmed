BACKGROUND
wood cell walls represent highly complex biocomposites that consists of repertoires of polysaccharides and lignins integrated into a three-dimensional conglomerate  <cit> . at the microstructural level, wood cell walls are composed of both primary- and dominating secondary cell wall layers in which the major  and minor  chemical components are heterogeneously dispersed and integrated. understanding the cell wall's complexity is of great interest both for plant biology and for plant processing in food and pulp industry.

one of the key main challenges for an improved understanding of wood cell wall structure especially, in relation to properties, is an ability to specifically localise and visualised the spatial distribution of the major polysaccharide components  in vivo. in lignified cell walls this is quite challenging since the hemicelluloses interface between the cellulose and lignin forming a heterogeneous polymer complex and it is exacting to distinguish between the various components in the different cell wall layers. xylan is the dominant hemicellulose found in hardwoods and depending on species, normally represents 15–30% of the total dry matter content  <cit> ; the major component being an o-acetyl-4-o-methylglucurono-β-d-xylan referred as glucuronoxylan. in softwoods, xylan normally forms 5–10% of the total dry matter as arabinoglucuronxylan and consists of a backbone of  <dig> -linked β-d-xylopyranose units, partially substituted by 4-o-methyl-α-d-glucuronic acid and α-l-arabinofuranose units  <cit> . knowledge on the microdistribution of hemicelluloses  within wood cell walls has come primarily from early gross chemical studies on sections from cambium layers at different stages of cell wall differentiation  <cit> , by the application of xylanase-gold complexes to plant cell walls and pulp fibres  <cit>  and by microscope observations after selective xylan removal  <cit> . more recently monoclonal antibodies specific for xylans have been successfully used as probes on plant fibres  and other non-lignified plant materials  <cit> , but not wood. there has also been great interest to chemically map and assess the removal and sorption of xylans onto fibres during kraft pulping processes in order to develop improved washing and preventive methods thus improving the technical properties of paper products  <cit> . however, apart from these examples very little is known on the microdistribution of xylans across lignified wood cell walls.

a plethora of direct  and indirect methods  have been employed to visualise carbohydrates in plant materials by both light- and electron microscopy  <cit> . historically, antibodies have been the markers of choice and a range of monoclonal probes have been produced for visualising plant cell wall carbohydrates   <cit> . more recently, several non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules  have also been reported to show great potential as specific and versatile markers of carbohydrates in plant materials  <cit> . cbms are a group of natural binders that most often constitute parts of modular glycoside hydrolysing or modifying enzymes. based on their sequences, cbms are classified into  <dig> families http://http:afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/cazy/, however, there are large variations in binding specificities, towards crystalline, amorphous and soluble polysaccharides, both between and within the families  <cit> . cbms represent an attractive alternative to antibody probes not only because of their size  and intrinsic specificity to individual carbohydrates – often different regions of the same substrate may be targeted- but also because of their ease of production and ability for modification with peptides and fluorescent , tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate ) and gold markers for microscopy  <cit> . we have previously developed methods for detection of cellulose in wood cell walls by visualising native cellulose-specific cbms  bound to their target in both light- and electron microscopy  <cit> . although several natural cbms are available for these applications, the numbers are relatively low. it is reasonable to expect that probes showing superior performance in given applications will be available by having a larger population of molecules to choose from. combinatorial library and selection technologies provide a solution to this need. here we further developed this approach and report on the application of a range of engineered xylan-binding cbms for targeting xylan in wood  sections and on the surface of birch kraft pulp fibres. the advantages of using synthetic cbms -which is novel for this study- over native cbms is related to their molecular properties such as stability and binding specificity that can be targeted by engineering. the synthetic xylan-binding cbms utilised in this work for in-situ visualisation of xylan in fresh wood sections and whole fibre materials performed well, clearly demonstrating their usefulness in studies on plant materials.

RESULTS
binding properties of xylan-binding cbms
the wild type  cbm4- <dig> from the xylanase xyn 10a of rhodothermis marinus is a type b cbm  <cit>  displaying a groove-shaped binding site that fits polysaccharide chains well  <cit> . this cbm binds not only to xylan but also other non-crystalline plant carbohydrates  <cit> . in a previous study, we had constructed a combinatorial library of cbm4- <dig>  <cit>  and used the phage-display system to select for cbm-variants specific for different ligands. the binding properties of three cbms, x- <dig>  x- <dig> and x- <dig>  all selected using the insoluble part of birch wood xylan as a selection target were further investigated in this work with the aim of defining the potential to use such modules in analysis of xylans in plant tissues. the sequences of these proteins and a control module unable to bind plant carbohydrates are all very similar and they differ from the wt protein  by only 4– <dig> amino acid substitutions . despite the fact that they originate from the same selection, these cbms have different affinities and specificities for a number of tested carbohydrates. affinity electrophoresis demonstrated that the x- <dig> variant, like wt cbm4- <dig>  binds to a range of carbohydrates . in contrast, both x- <dig> and x- <dig> are substantially more specific for xylans and do not recognise xyloglucan or glucan-containing carbohydrates . in addition, isothermal titration calorimetry studies further confirmed that x- <dig> was much more prone to bind xylans than any other carbohydrate targets investigated further demonstrating its modified specificity  <cit> . relative binding affinities, determined by affinity electrophoresis, revealed a decrease in affinity for xylan of x- <dig> and x- <dig> and a somewhat higher affinity for xylan of x- <dig> compared to the wt cbm4- <dig> . altogether we have demonstrated our access to a range of very sequence-similar cbms with diverse binding properties that can be used as a utility in analysis of the carbohydrate composition in lignocellulose materials.

binding of the cbms to untreated wood sections
in order to assess the ability of the xylan-binding modules to function as analytical probes, we used these proteins for staining tissue samples derived from three wood species known to differ in their content of xylan. a very high content of xylan-based carbohydrates is characteristic for betula verrucosa  wood  <cit> . pinus sylvestris  wood contains approximately 20% of the xylan found in birch wood  <cit> , while wood derived from populus tremuloides  is intermediate  <cit> . moreover birch and poplar tension wood, but not pine wood, contains fibres with a special morphology and chemical composition due to development of a gelatinous layer   <cit> . the g-layer is known to have high cellulose content with a high degree of crystallinity  <cit> . we assume that the combination of almost pure cellulose in the g-layer and hemicelluloses in s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> layers make tension wood an interesting model for assessment of carbohydrate specific probes. we therefore assessed the xylan-binding cbms that displayed different xylan-binding properties, as outlined above in these models.

fluorescent microscopy demonstrated substantial differences in staining patterns of birch, poplar and pine wood sections with wt cbm4- <dig>  x- <dig>  x- <dig> and x- <dig> . all cbms showed binding in comparison to the control samples , wt cbm4- <dig> and x- <dig> displaying the most efficient wood labelling . although less intense, more stable staining was characteristic for x- <dig> staining experiments , where the same intensity of fluorescent signal was retained for at least  <dig> hours giving this module an important advantage as a specific binding probe in assay setups that demand higher labelling stability. the observed  reduced affinity for xylan of some of the engineered modules, in particular x- <dig>  obviously did not prevent their use in these applications. the binding of lower affinity cbms is likely to be facilitated by high local concentration of repetitive structures recognised by them in plant tissues. alternatively, the affinity of e.g. x- <dig> for some specific structures in xylan may be higher than that observed when assessing the affinity for solubilized carbohydrates allowing for its use in staining of plant materials.

in birch and poplar samples, wt cbm4- <dig> and x- <dig> bound to the cell wall but predominantly to g-layers reported to consist of almost pure cellulose  whereas x- <dig> and x- <dig> signals were detected within s <dig>  s <dig> layers and middle lamellar regions . these differential staining patterns are best explained by different affinity and probably more importantly specificity profiles of the cbms, as outlined above. given the inability of these modules to bind crystalline cellulose, it is possible that wt cbm4- <dig> and x- <dig> cbms labelled xyloglucans within the g-layer, possibly in areas with residual lignin  <cit> . to define in more detail the presence of binding sites recognised by these xylan-binding cbms, it was observed that all cbms, i.e. both those that are  and those that are not  cross-reactive to other types of hemicellulose carbohydrates like xyloglucans, stained pine samples in areas of bordered pit chambers  in earlywood and on the inner surface of cells in latewood . there is however no previous evidence for the existence of xyloglucans in bordered pit chambers. it has been shown previously using selective enzyme removal and enzyme-antibody labelling that bordered pit membranes in pine sapwood tracheids are composed of non-lignified pectin and a cellulose-rich region in the centre of the pit called a torus, which is supported by a surrounding margo that contains microfibrils of cellulose  <cit> . the fact that modules that are quite specific for xylose oligomers bind to these structures, suggests presence of at least rudimentary xylan in pine bordered pit chambers.

variation in binding patterns of the different cbm-variants to xylan embedded in the wood cell walls was also observed in the study of mccartney et al.  <cit>  where some natural xylan-binding cbms stained both primary and secondary cell walls while some  only stained secondary walls. apart from the cbm's specificity and the actual presence of particular xylan structures, ligand accessibility is also a determinant factor for specific staining of plant materials using this type of modules. the binding mechanism of many xylan-binding cbms involves sandwiching of the ligand, which then requires access to both faces of the carbohydrate chain that may be a limitation in lignocellulose materials. it is believed that the x- <dig> module has evolved to use only one aromatic residue for interaction with only one face of the xylan chain  <cit> . these binding features of x- <dig> could facilitate its binding to the embedded xylan chains and may explain the very stable x- <dig> staining in the present study. altogether, the availability of following a molecular evolution procedure of sets of cbms with defined binding properties, some members of which are less cross-reactive in comparison to naturally occurring cbms  <cit> , allow assessment and profiling of carbohydrate composition of plant cell walls and define differences observable between various samples.

binding of the cbms to treated wood sections and pulp fibres
as outlined above, cbms derived from the library built on the cbm4- <dig> scaffold  <cit>  can be used to investigate native and normal wood tissues. modification of such material by different means may add additional information concerning their construction. to exploit these possibilities, we investigated the ability of x- <dig> to recognise xylan molecules in birch and pine wood samples modified through biotechnological processing.

staining of delignified tissue samples  with fitc-conjugated x- <dig> resulted in much higher signals in comparison to staining of mature  birch and pine tissues . in normal pine sections, x- <dig> binding was mainly detected in border pit regions  and inner surface of cells   whereas in birch section staining was observed mostly in middle lamellae regions . in contrast, signals from x- <dig> binding were evenly distributed over the surfaces of delignified sections in both wood types . this finding suggests, as expected, that removal of lignin increases the access to the xylan binding sites. staining of delignified samples by various cbms may be beneficially preformed to ensure the efficiency of the delignification procedure and to exploit the access of specific carbohydrate epitopes prior to enzyme treatment  of wood materials. similarly, hemicellulose removal following a bleaching procedure could be efficiently assessed in pulp fibres  further expanding the area of useful applications of these molecularly engineered modules.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have demonstrated that molecularly engineered cbms based on the cbm4- <dig> scaffold can have a wide range of applications in basic wood research. we envisage that such engineered modules will provide the research community with powerful new tools to complement existing detection reagents such as monoclonal antibodies or natural cbms. in addition to the xylan-specific cbms used in this work, we have also reported the successful selection of cbm-variants from the same molecular library for their specificities towards other plant cell wall carbohydrates, such as mannan and xyloglucan  <cit> . the use of engineered cbms in future studies will further expand the potential of these types of synthetic probes for mapping of pulp fibre and wood sections. the binding properties of these modules would also make them useful in the analysis of technological processes including those relevant for quality assessment of industrial processes.
