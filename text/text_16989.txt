BACKGROUND
mirnas are small noncoding rnas that regulate gene expression by causing degradation of mrnas or by inhibiting protein translation  <cit> . the emerging conventional view is that mirnas are deregulated in all human cancers  <cit> . mirnas act by targeting a short sequence  in the 3'utr of targeted mrnas. numerous algorithms have been developed that allow prediction of mirna targets. however, the prediction accuracy is low and includes a large number of false positives and false negatives  <cit> . from our analysis of the mir- <dig> family of mirnas and its biological activities we realized that the combination of differentially expressed genes  can be used to deduce the biological activities of mirnas  <cit> . we and others found that mir- <dig> regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  by suppressing the expression of mesenchymal genes and inducing expression of epithelial genes  <cit> . we recently developed a new method pcc) to better correlate mirnas and gene expression with the goal of predicting biological activities of mirnas. we tested this method by analyzing gene array and mirna expression data sets available for the  <dig> cell lines of the drug screen panel at the national cancer institute   <cit> . by comparing genes that positively correlate with mirnas and mirna families we clustered mirnas into functional groups. one group of mirnas, which was preferentially expressed in epithelial cells, contained all  <dig> members of the mir- <dig> family. another group antagonized the members of the epithelial group of mirnas. in addition, we identified and validated three other mirnas that regulated emt: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> . the data sets are available in a searchable form at mirconnect.org.

multiple studies have reported correlations of mirna and mrna data in nci <dig> cell lines  <cit>  as well as in primary tumors  <cit> . most of these studies identified targets of individual mirnas in a specific cancer background, while some also identified mirna functions across multiple tumor origins  <cit> . however, the primary goal of most studies was to predict targets of individual mirnas and to use this information to predict function. in contrast, our approach is independent of mirna target predictions.

certain mirnas  can act as tumor suppressors or as oncogenes  <cit> . not all oncomirs are deregulated in all cancers suggesting that mirnas have specific activities in different cancers and/or cancer stages. as well, different tumorigenic activities found in cancer could even be antagonistic. a putative example of such antagonistic activities might be cell proliferation and "stemness". thus, we predicted the existence of functionally antagonistic, oncogenic mirnas. to test this hypothesis in a cancer relevant context, we extended our analysis using the spcc method to primary cancer data sets available at the cancer genome atlas : ovarian cancer , glioblastoma multiforme , and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma . the new data have now been incorporated into version  <dig> of mirconnect. using the spcc analysis and by comparing the expression of mirna and mrnas with expression data for  <dig> well described oncogenic signatures, we have identified large groups of mirnas that antagonize each other in cancer cells. two of these antagonizing mirna groups are considered to be oncogenic. one group  is dominated by members of the mir- <dig> gene clusters, the other  contains mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  pathway analysis suggests that both agonists and antagonists are tumorigenic and regulate different cancer relevant signaling pathways. in gbm, we found that patients in whom the expression of the antagonists predominates have poorer overall survival, which suggests that while both mir- <dig> and its relatives and mir-221/ <dig> may be good biomarkers for detecting tumor cells, high mir-221/ <dig> expression maybe a better predictor of poor outcome.

RESULTS
identification of antagonistic mirnas in the nci <dig> cells
we recently used mirna and mrna data sets available for the nci <dig> cells to identify groups of mirnas with similar biological functions  <cit> . for this purpose, we have developed a novel pcc analysis pcc) that mimics an in silico titration assay. using this method, we found that  <dig> mirnas significantly expressed in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> nci <dig> cell lines clustered not only according to their seed sequences, genomic organization, and tissue specific expression but also according to their biological function. when the mirnas were clustered according to the genes with which they were positively correlated, a total of  <dig> clusters were defined  using a threshold of  <dig> % correlating genes to define a cluster as described  <cit> . mirnas in cluster i contained the  <dig> mirnas of the mir- <dig> family known to be strong emt regulators. these data were based on three independent emt signatures: emt signature  <dig>  normal tissue induced to undergo emt by addition of tgfβ, emt signature  <dig>  ras transformed cells induced to undergo emt by addition of tgfβ, and emt signature  <dig>  metaplastic versus ductal breast cancer. since the three signatures were very similar, we based the analysis on the average of the three signatures . again, cluster i was correlated with the epithelial genes in the combined emt signature . in addition to the mir- <dig> family members, the emt signature also contained mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  which we previously identified and validated as novel emt regulating mirnas  <cit> . with the same level of significance, we now identified mirnas in cluster xiii as mirnas that correlated with the expression of mesenchymal genes. these data suggest that the mirnas in cluster xiii in the nci <dig> cell lines may have opposing functions when compared the mirnas in cluster i. in addition, we previously identified the mirnas in cluster v as mirnas that positively correlated with c-myc induced genes and negatively correlated with c-myc repressed genes  <cit> . this was also evident when we plotted the data using a combined factor of c-myc regulation . we also showed recently that mirnas in cluster v are most strongly regulated by c-myc. the most prominent mirna family present in cluster v are family members of the mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster and its related paralogs, the mir-106 ~  <dig> and mir-106 ~  <dig> clusters. all of these clusters of mirnas are known to be regulated by c-myc  <cit> . interestingly, the cluster of mirnas most negatively correlating with c-myc induced genes and strongly correlating with c-myc repressed genes are in cluster xiii, which contains the mirnas that correlated with mesenchymal genes. mir- <dig> and all its homologues are widely recognized as highly oncogenic mirnas  <cit> , while the cluster i epithelial specific mirnas are viewed as tumor suppressive in most solid cancers  <cit> .

so how is it possible that the cluster xiii mirnas can be antagonists to the epithelial mirnas in cluster i and at the same time antagonists to the oncogenic mirnas in cluster v? this result suggested that in the context of cancer mirnas cannot be simply divided into oncogenic and tumor suppressive mirnas. this insight became more evident when we reassessed a principal component  analysis of mirnas based on the genes with which they positively correlated  <cit>  . in this analysis, mirnas grouped in a two dimensional space according to the similarity with which they correlated with the  <dig>  genes available for the nci <dig> cells. of the  <dig> pcs, the combination of the first two described about 50% of all variance among mirnas . all mirnas in the three clusters  in figure 1b are labeled in the colors shown in figure 1a. the pca clustering produced the shape of a three bladed propeller in which the members of the three clusters occupied the tips of the three blades. the first pc separated agonists from mesenchymal antagonists, while the second pc separated epithelial mirnas from both agonists and mesenchymal antagonists. the three fold symmetry of the pca plot suggested that the mirna world is divided in at least three cancer relevant activities whereby epithelial mirnas are antagonized by mesenchymal mirnas, which are c-myc repressed, and epithelial mirnas functionally antagonize c-myc induced mirnas, most notably members of the mir- <dig> family. in order to assess the nature of the correlating cancer specific genes for each mirna cluster, we selected  <dig> different oncogenic gene signatures each containing from five to several hundred different genes . in order to increase the stringency, we then selected the set of overlapping genes and mirnas that either positively  or negatively  correlated with each other. we found that genes in  <dig> oncogenic signatures positively correlated and  <dig> signatures negatively correlated with a group of agonistic mirnas that were dominated by members of the mir- <dig> family  . a number of mirnas belonging to the "mesenchymal" cluster showed a correlation that was exactly opposite to these agonistic mirnas. we called these antagonists. the antagonist mirna cluster  negatively correlated with epithelial genes  and positively correlated with mesenchymal genes. exact functional opposites were found in the mirna group that contained the mir- <dig> families plus mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> . in summary, the data suggest that in cancer cell lines mirnas can be grouped according to their function, and at least three major, mutually antagonistic functions can be assigned.

the primary cancer data sets
while the data obtained from nci <dig> cells identified mirna groups that could function as antagonists, the analysis had a number of limitations: 1) because the analysis was based only on cancer cell lines without comparison to normal tissue, it was uncertain how relevant these connections were to cancer. 2) the data were based on a high quality but limited set of only  <dig> mirna quantified by real time pcr. 3) the relevance of the findings to primary human cancer remained unclear. to address all three shortcomings, we turned to the large database of the cancer genome atlas . at the time of our analysis, the tcga database contained information on  <dig> solid cancers. additional file 4: table s <dig>  column  <dig> lists the number of available tumor samples for each cancer. column  <dig> shows the number of samples for which both mrna and mirna data were available. in order to limit our analysis to high quality data, we elected not to consider any patient sample with a tumor content of less than 70%. tumor content in the tcga samples is determined by a pathologist who evaluates a slice from the top and a slice from the bottom of the tissue block used for rna isolation to quantify the percent tumor content. in additional file 4: table s <dig>  column  <dig>  the number of samples is listed for which information from the bottom and top of the block was available. column  <dig> gives the number of patient samples with more than 70% tumor content . to maintain a robust sample size, we did not further consider cancers with fewer than  <dig> patient samples. only  <dig> cancers remained: breast cancer , glioblastoma , ovarian cancer , and clear cell renal cancer . for each of the cancers, pathology data were available . in order to have a homogenous patient population and to give the analysis sufficient statistical power, we focused on the largest group of patients with similar features for each cancer. in breast cancer, we selected the  <dig> infiltrating ductal er positive brca. for gbm, we included  <dig> patients with untreated primary gbm. in kirc we selected all  <dig> treated patients with tumor grade g2-g <dig> and all tumor stages. in ovca we selected  <dig> untreated patients with primary cancer in the ovaries, grade  <dig> and stages iiib, iiic, and iv. we proceeded with the analysis including these four solid cancers. however, early analysis indicated that the breast cancer data sets were not giving consistent correlations. this was likely because the breast cancer samples corresponded to more than one disease  <cit> . therefore, we elected to perform the analysis on three cancers: ovca, gbm, and kirc.

mirconnect  <dig> : identification of antagonistic mirnas in primary cancers
the number of genes and mirnas for each cancer with expression data provided in the tcga data sets is given in additional file 4: table s <dig>  in additional file 4: table s <dig> column  <dig> the number of normal controls is given. in order to focus only on genes and mirnas that are cancer relevant we excluded for each cancer all genes and mirnas which were less than  <dig>  fold deregulated when their average expression in tumor and normal samples were compared. the number of mirnas/mrnas deregulated for each cancer was 173/ <dig> , 121/ <dig>  and 260/ <dig> . the number of genes and mirnas that were similarly deregulated in all three cancers was low  suggesting major cancer-specific differences. the data and correlation analysis between all mirnas and mrnas deregulated > <dig>  fold in the three cancers can be accessed in a searchable form at mirconnect.org or mirconnect.net. in addition to the data on nci <dig> cells based on a set of real-time pcr mirna data  and lna array data , data on ovarian cancer are found under mirconnect-ovca; gbm is under mirconnect-gbm, and renal cancer is found under mirconnect-kirc.

to test whether the genes and mirnas specifically deregulated in each cancer were functionally connected, we correlated the expression of the deregulated mirnas with expression of the mrnas using the spcc method previously developed to analyze the nci <dig> data. when the cluster analysis of the deregulated mirnas was performed with the positively correlating cancer-specific mrnas using the same  <dig> % threshold to identify clusters , the  <dig> mirnas in ovca fell into  <dig> clusters; for gbm we found  <dig> clusters, and for kirc  <dig> clusters . the same analysis was repeated with all genes that negatively correlated with the expression of the mirnas. the complete lists of mirnas in each of the identified clusters in all analyses  are shown in additional file 6: table s <dig>  the genes that correlated with each cluster of mirnas were compared to the three emt signatures and the signature of c-myc regulated genes, and a number of mirna clusters were found to correlate with emt and c-myc regulated genes .

in contrast to the nci <dig> cell analysis in which all members of the mir- <dig> family correlated with epithelial  genes , the situation in the primary cancers was more complex. in ovca, the cluster most significantly correlating with the e genes was cluster v. while this cluster contained the epithelial mirna mir- <dig>  all  <dig> members of the mir- <dig> family were part of cluster vi, which did not correlate with the e genes as significantly as cluster v mirnas. in gbm, none of the mir- <dig> family members are deregulated in cancer and were not part of the analysis. two clusters  significantly correlated with the expression of e genes suggesting that in gbm mirnas other than mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  or mir- <dig> regulate the epithelial nature of the cancer cells. finally, in kirc all mir- <dig> family members were found to be part of cluster vii, which together with cluster vi mirnas most significantly correlated with e genes. for each of the three cancers, one cluster was found to contain mirnas that significantly correlated with the expression of mesenchymal  genes . for ovca this was cluster i; for gbm it was cluster xi, and for kirc it was cluster i. however, there was no overlap among these mirnas between any of the three cancers , again suggesting that this activity was regulated by different cancer-specific mirnas.

the situation was very different for c-myc induced genes. in all three cancers, the cluster that most significantly correlated with the expression of c-myc induced genes contained a large number of mir- <dig> mirnas: cluster xi in ovca, cluster xi in gbm, and cluster iii in kirc . these significantly overlapped with the agonistic mirnas previously identified in the nci <dig> cell analysis . this raised the question of whether more than two antagonistic mirna cluster occurred in primary cancer cells, as had been observed in nci <dig> cells. therefore, we performed an integrated mirna/mrna analysis to determine if any of the different mirna clusters identified in the three cancers correlated with gene expression profiles associated with the three emt signatures or the  <dig> known oncogenic gene signatures . to increase the stringency, we performed two analyses for each comparison, one in which the clustering was based on positively correlating genes and one based on negatively correlating genes. the goal of this analysis was to identify mirna clusters that were positively correlated with a number of gene signatures  and other clusters that would have an opposite correlation  with the same gene signatures. details on the analysis are found in methods and in additional file 8: table s <dig>  the results of the complete analysis for each cancer are summarized in figure 3a-c. all significantly antagonizing mirna clusters are shown. in all three cancers, the major agonistic mirna group contained members of the mir- <dig> clusters . interestingly, in gbm and kirc this agonistic group antagonized an epithelial mirna group, but in ovca it antagonized a mesenchymal group of mirnas.

the agonistic group of mirnas shares  <dig> members of the mir- <dig> cluster plus mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in all three cancers, based on the analysis of both positively and negatively correlating genes . interestingly, the  <dig> mir- <dig> family members are found in all three mir- <dig> gene clusters and all  <dig> seed families . among the mirnas that antagonize the mir- <dig> group in all three cancers, only two were shared. in all  <dig> analyses  mir- <dig> was present. the highly related mir- <dig> was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> analyses . we therefore conclude that in all three cancers mir-221/ <dig> antagonize the mir- <dig> family.

the mir- <dig> group and mir-221/ <dig> are antagonistic in three cancers
the agonistic group of mirnas  correlated inversely with a number of oncogenic signatures when compared to the antagonistic group . while there were many cancer specific links, we sought to identify correlations that were independent of cancer type. figure 4a presents the mirnas and the oncogenic gene signatures that inversely correlated with the agonists and the antagonists in all three cancers. ten agonistic mirnas  and two antagonistic mirnas  that correlate with genes in six gene signatures  operate in opposition. a number of these oncogenes are known to be connected to the mir- <dig> family. mir- <dig> is known to be regulated by and to regulate c-myc and e2f  <cit> . in addition, dek is regulated by e2f  <cit> . it is at present unknown how mir-221/ <dig> is linked to either c-myc or e2f. while mir- <dig> and mir-221/ <dig> are functionally antagonistic, they are both often upregulated in cancer, and both are considered to be oncogenic in cancer cells  <cit> . functional antagonism does not necessarily mean that they exhibit inverse expression levels. when compared to the expression in normal control tissue, the expression of mir-221/ <dig> in kirc was as high as that of mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster mirnas . these data suggested that the agonistic and antagonistic mirnas, while both potentially oncogenic, may regulate distinct sets of genes associated with different tumorigenic pathways. in order to test this hypothesis, we combined all genes that were part of the six gene signatures antagonized by the two mirna groups. for each of the  <dig> agonistic/antagonistic mirnas and for each of the three cancers, we calculated the spcc for all individual mirna/mrna correlations. the data were subjected to a two-dimensional unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis according to the similarities of spccs . the results of this analysis are shown in form of heat maps in figure 5a. in each cancer, all  <dig> agonistic mirnas  were clustered, as were the antagonistic mirnas . in general, the genes that positively correlated with the agonists negatively correlated with the antagonists and vice versa. this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that agonistic and antagonist mirnas contribute to different activities of cancer cells.

oncogenic agonists and antagonists regulate distinct cancer specific pathways
to identify the genes that are most highly correlated with either the agonists or the antagonists and to perform pathway analysis, we ranked all signature genes according to the difference  between the average spcc of the  <dig> agonists and the average spcc of the  <dig> antagonists . to focus on the most significantly correlating genes, we selected all genes that had a delta >  <dig> or < − <dig>  the lists of agonistic or antagonist genes for each cancer and for all cancers combined are provided in additional file 11: table s <dig>  to explore the possible functions of these genes, we subjected each list to pathway analysis. ingenuity integrated pathway analysis  revealed that genes whose expression positively correlated with expression of the agonists fell into functional networks that were consistent with cell cycle regulation and dna replication . in contrast, genes whose expression positively correlated with expression of the antagonists fell into functional networks that included various forms of developmental processes and cellular growth and metabolism . this was true for each individual cancer as well as for the combination of the three cancers . similar results were found when the same genes were subjected to gene ontology analysis using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  . the top three most highly enriched clusters of genes that correlated with the agonist groups of mirnas  suggested that the agonistic mirnas positively regulate cell cycle and dna replication. in contrast, the top three most highly enriched clusters of genes that correlated with the antagonists  suggested that the antagonistic mirnas are involved in different developmental processes . using the pathway analysis tool in the ingenuity ipa, we analyzed the pathways most prominently aligned with the regulated gene sets. the pathways most prominently positively correlated with the agonistic mirnas were cell cycle regulation and the dna replication complex . in contrast, some of the most prominent pathways that correlated with the antagonists include growth factor receptor signaling pathways consistent with the growth promoting activity assigned to these mirnas . in summary, we have identified two opposing mirna groups, both of which are oncogenic, presumably by regulating different cancer relevant pathways.

different patient populations are dominated by either the agonists or the antagonists
how do we explain the paradox that for each of the three cancers two mirna groups were identified that had opposing activities yet are both considered to be oncogenic, and both are correlated with distinct sets of oncogenic genes? there are three, not necessarily mutually exclusive, possible explanations: 1) the patient population is heterogeneous, and in some patients tumors are driven mostly by mir- <dig> mirnas and in others tumors are driven by mir-221/ <dig>  2) tumors are heterogeneous, and areas within the tumors contain cells that are predominantly regulated by one or the other mirna group. 3) both mirna groups are active in most tumor cells but regulate different sets of tumorigenic genes. to get a preliminary answer, we analyzed the patient data attached to each data set in our analyses. assuming that the expression of either the agonists or the antagonists would differentiate two patient populations, we performed a one-by-one regression analysis for each of the  <dig> agonists with either mir- <dig> or mir- <dig> in each cancer . interestingly, all correlations with p < <dig>  exhibited a negative pcc suggesting that agonists and antagonists within each cancer type were indeed inversely correlated. the most significantly negatively correlated mirna pairs for each cancer are shown in figure 7a. for ovca this was mir-222/mir-20a; for gbm it was mir-222/mir-19a, and for kirc it was mir-221/mir- <dig>  the most significant inverse correlation was seen in the gbm pair. to test whether the predominance of either agonists or antagonists was prognostic, we analyzed patient data for each of the mirna pairs shown in figure 7a and additional file 10: table s <dig>  in each case, a high agonist/antagonist ratio was associated with better overall survival . for kirc this was only a trend, and for ovca it was a strong trend, almost reaching significance, but for gbm it was significant. for gbm we performed a kaplan-meier analysis and again found that patients with a high agonist/antagonist ratio had a more favorable outcome. specifically, we analyzed the effect of the two most significantly inversely correlated mirna pairs . patients with high mir-93/19a expression had a more favorable outcome compared to patients with high mir-221/ <dig> expression . our data suggest that while it cannot be excluded that agonists and antagonists act in the same cells or in different areas of the tumor, patients express different ratios of agonists/antagonists, and the predominance of the mir-221/mir- <dig> oncogenic mirnas results in poorer outcome than does predominance of mir- <dig> family members.

discussion
in this work we have identified groups of mirnas that antagonize each other in cancer cells beyond the simple concept of mirnas as either being tumor suppressors or oncogenes. this became apparent from our analysis of data sets from the nci <dig> cells, which are the basis of the mirconnect.org site. a large group of mirnas containing mostly members of the three mir- <dig> gene clusters  functionally antagonized a group of mirnas whose expression correlated with mesenchymal genes. this group of mesenchymal mirnas, in turn, antagonized mirnas that have been shown to be expressed in epithelial tissues including all members of the mir- <dig> family . the epithelial mirnas also included three mirnas we previously identified as novel epithelial regulators, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> .

we then extended this analysis from the nci <dig> cells to three primary cancers, ovca, gbm, and kirc. we employed the summed pcc analysis we recently developed  <cit> . unlike the nci <dig> cells data sets, normal tissue of similar tissue origin were available for all three cancers. this allowed us to focus the analysis only on mirnas and mrnas that were deregulated  in cancer, thereby making the entire analysis cancer specific. we have updated mirconnect.org to also include the data on the three cancers.

in all analyses, most members of the mir- <dig> family were clustered with mirnas that correlated with c-myc regulated genes and genes that are part of e2f gene signatures. this is consistent with the regulation of mir- <dig> by c-myc and with the fact that mir- <dig> is part of a regulatory network with e2f . because this strong connection was found in the nci <dig> cell based analysis and in the three primary cancers, we labeled these mirnas as agonists. in all analyses the agonistic mirnas were separable from and opposite to a group of mirnas that negatively correlated with c-myc induced genes. in contrast to the agonists, no single mirna was shared by all antagonistic mirna groups in all analyses. however, two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were found in this antagonistic group in all three primary cancers pointing at differences between cell lines and primary cancers. such differences were also evident in comparisons of correlations involving the epithelial mirnas. although all  <dig> mir- <dig> family members, coded by two different gene clusters, were tightly clustered in the nci <dig> cell lines, the situation was much different in the three primary cancers . in ovca, only mir- <dig> was part of the cluster with the strongest epithelial nature. in gbm, none of the mir- <dig> family members or novel emt regulators were found to be deregulated. however, in kirc all  <dig> mir- <dig> family members were found to be part of a highly epithelial mirna cluster, but within this large group they clustered according to their chromosomal localization. there could be a variety of reasons why the mir- <dig> family clustered so tightly in the nci <dig> analysis. for example, it might be a consequence of the fact that the cells have been cultured on plastic for a long time. it could also be that the nci <dig> cell lines represent a more homogeneous group of cells considering that they are all cancer cell lines. however, among the cell lines there is tremendous variation with respect to their epithelial nature. the analysis may simply highlight these biological differences suggesting that the nci <dig> analysis may be more useful for isolating general biological connections rather than cancer specific properties.

the agonist mirnas that we found to correlate with a large number of oncogenic gene signatures were dominated by members of the three mir- <dig> gene clusters . in contrast, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were found in the antagonistic mirna group in all three cancers. paradoxically, both mirnas families are considered to be oncogenic. the mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster of mirnas was originally identified as being amplified in b cell lymphoma patients. consequently, most of the data on mir- <dig> mirnas are in the context of its role as an oncogene in blood cancers. early on, a correlation with c-myc expression was noticed, and enforced expression of mir-17 ~  <dig> accelerated b cell lymphoma formation in mice  <cit> . subsequently, it was recognized that c-myc activates the mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster  <cit> . mir- <dig> was identified as part of an autoregulatory loop with e2f proteins. while all three e2fs can activate the mir-17 ~  <dig> promoter  <cit> , e2f <dig> and e2f <dig> are also targets of mir-17 ~  <dig> mirnas  <cit> . overexpression of mir-17 ~  <dig> has also been reported in solid cancers including lung cancer  <cit> , colon cancer  <cit> , thyroid cancer  <cit> , gastric cancer  <cit> , nasopharyngeal carcinoma  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> , lung squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> , malignant glioma  <cit> , and pancreatic cancer  <cit> . in fact, mir-17 ~  <dig> was reported to be a component of a solid cancer mirna signature  <cit> . of the two non-mir- <dig> family members  among the agonists in our study, mir- <dig> is upregulated in bladder cancer  <cit> , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> , gastric cancer  <cit> , and colon cancer  <cit> . little is known about the role of mir- <dig> in cancer. similar to mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and/or mir- <dig> are highly upregulated, often without concurrent upregulation of mir-17 ~  <dig>  in various cancers including glioblastoma  <cit> , liver cancer  <cit> , pancreatic cancer  <cit> , bladder cancer  <cit> , gastric cancer  <cit> , ovarian cancer  <cit> , urothelial carcinoma  <cit> , nodal marginal zone lymphoma  <cit> , and papillary thyroid carcinoma  <cit> .

our pathway analyses suggest that while both agonists and antagonists are oncogenic, they regulate different oncogenic signaling pathways, each of which may contribute to cancer development or metastases by different mechanisms. different mechanisms of action for the agonists and antagonists are supported by a substantial body of published work. c-myc driven mir-17- <dig> expression has been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis  <cit> , and inhibition of mir-17-5p and mir-20a induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells  <cit>  and leads to induction of apoptosis, cellular senescence, and growth inhibition of thyroid cancer cells  <cit> . mir-17 ~  <dig> drives proliferation by targeting a number of cell cycle regulators of the g/s transition  <cit> . deletion of the mir-17- <dig> cluster in mice resulted in increased levels of the apoptosis inducer bim. the mice died after birth, and exhibited lung hypoplasia and lack of b cell development  <cit> . in humans, a germline deletion of mir-17- <dig> causes skeletal and growth defects  <cit> . mir- <dig> has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis, cell cycle, and cell death regulation, while mir-221/ <dig> has been linked to cell proliferation in cancer. inhibition of endogenous mir-221/ <dig> impaired growth of prostate carcinoma xenografts in mice  <cit> , inhibited the growth of liver cancer  <cit> , and arrested pancreatic cancer cells in cell cycle driving them into apoptosis  <cit> . anti-mir- <dig> treatment in an orthotopic hcc mouse model blocked cancer by reducing proliferation  <cit> . in contrast, overexpression of mir- <dig> in a mouse model of liver cancer stimulated growth of tumorigenic murine hepatic progenitor cells  <cit> , and mir-221/ <dig> increased proliferation of er positive breast cancer cells  <cit> , gastric cancer cells  <cit> , and gbm  <cit> . most significantly, transgenic overexpression of mir- <dig> alone caused hcc, and anti-mir- <dig> treatment reduced tumor load  <cit> . mir-221/ <dig> has been shown to affect cancer proliferation by targeting p <dig> kip <dig>  <cit> . this was specifically shown for prostate cancer  <cit> , melanoma  <cit> , hcc  <cit> , and breast cancer  <cit> . in addition, activation of the akt pathway has also been reported  <cit> . our analysis suggests that mir-221/ <dig> does not regulate proliferation, but plays a role in development. a connection between mir- <dig> and development has been reported; overexpression of anti mir- <dig> in human embryonic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells triggered osteogenic differentiation  <cit> .

our analysis indicates that the distinction between mirnas as oncogenic or tumor suppressive does not adequately describe their functions. in fact in this report, we have identified two mirna groups that are oncogenic and, yet, are functional antagonists across three different human cancers. given the fact that the two groups of mirnas antagonized a large portion of the genes that comprise  <dig> oncogenic signatures included in the analysis, it is possible that the two mirna groups act in the same cells. however, by comparing different patients, we found that in some patients, expression of mir- <dig> family members predominated, whereas in others mir-221/ <dig> predominated. this was especially obvious for gbm. in all three cancers, patients with a high mir-221/ <dig> to mir- <dig> ratio had poorer long term survival. in gbm the difference was significant. in gbm, a high mir-93/mir- <dig> or a high mir-19a/mir- <dig> ratio was predictive of better overall survival. there was no correlation between the mir- <dig> to 221/ <dig> ratio and tumor grade or stage  suggesting that the ratio of agonists to antagonists does not change much during tumor progression, but does suggest that different mirnas are expressed in different patients.

CONCLUSIONS
numerous studies have assigned cancer relevant activities to mirnas using both mirna and mrna profiles in either nci <dig> cell lines or in primary tumors . most of these studies have used pearson’s correlation coefficients and/or target prediction algorithms to identify targets of individual mirnas in a specific cancer background. a few studies have identified common or specific mirna functions across tumors of multiple origins by applying various statistical models  <cit>  or by analyzing oncogenic signatures  <cit> . the primary aim of most of these studies was to predict and validate novel cancer relevant mirna targets. in contrast, our work across the nci <dig> cell lines and three primary cancers has focused on mirna downstream effector genes without considering target prediction, and hence, effectively avoids the highly false positive rate produced by target prediction algorithms. our method permits extraction of statistically solid and biologically relevant mirna-mrna pairs on a genome-wide scale. in so doing, we have identified functionally defined mirna groups which have opposing activities in cancers, yet can both be considered to be oncogenic. these activities are not specific for individual cancers, and suggest that they reflect fundamental activities of mirnas in human cancers.
