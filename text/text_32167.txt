BACKGROUND
an ideal way to describe transcriptome structure would be to elaborate on its composition based on the scale of absolute copy numbers of individual mrnas per cell. absolute quantification would help to precisely grasp the structure of the transcriptome. it would also accelerate exchange and sharing of data, which have remained difficult despite of considerable efforts to standardize the description format of transcriptome data in public databases  <cit> . while a variety of approaches can be undertaken for absolute quantification of individual transcripts, the basic principle of each approach can be classified as tag-counting, hybridization, or pcr.

tag-counting methods include bodymapping  <cit> , sage  <cit> , mpss  <cit> , cage  <cit> , and gis-pet  <cit> . since these methods are random sampling approaches, a large enough number of tags have to be collected to deduce a statistically reliable portrait of the transcriptome, which can be converted to an absolute quantification data using an appropriate calibration. the recent advances in massively parallel sequencing technologies are expected to drastically improve the power of tag-counting approaches  <cit> .

hybridization-based methods include northern blot hybridization and those based on liquid-phase hybridization, such as nuclease protection assay. although these classical methods are of high accuracy and reliability, tedious procedures inherent to them have hampered their applications to large-scale analyses. in terms of comprehensiveness, microarray or dna chip hybridization is extremely powerful. a protocol was reported to measure absolute expression using microarray  <cit> . in this protocol, a cdna sample of interest was hybridized in conjunction with a known amount of an oligonucleotide complementary to every feature on the array, and each signal derived from the sample was corrected by that from the oligonucleotide to be used as the abundance of the mrna corresponding to that feature. although this protocol can control for differences in target dna quantity, spot morphology, and uneven hybridization, it cannot normalize labeling and sequence-specific hybridization differences among transcripts  <cit> . another protocol that uses a set of "spike-in" calibration standards was proposed to estimate, but not to directly measure, endogenous transcript abundance  <cit> .

among the pcr-based approaches, real-time or kinetic pcr and competitive pcr are considered as the most sensitive and accurate ones  <cit> . real-time pcr can be used as a high throughput assay, because it obviates any post-pcr steps such as gel electrophoresis. however, it is heavily influenced by the quality of the template and the stochastic nature of the first phases of amplification. in this context, competitive pcr is more robust than real-time pcr, although its application to a large-scale analysis had been hampered by the need to prepare a competitor standard for each target; a target and its competitor standard have to be co-amplified with a single primer pair to give products that differ in size.

this obstacle can be overcome by a unique method termed adaptor-tagged competitive -pcr  <cit> . in atac-pcr, double-stranded cdnas are synthesized using a biotinylated oligo-dt primer and digested with a restriction enzyme, usually a 4-base cutter. the 3'-end restriction fragment of each cdna is purified using avidin beads and ligated to an adaptor. the two cdna samples to be compared are tagged with different adaptors. notably, these adaptors share a common adaptor-specific primer  sequence, but its location is different between the two adaptors. the adaptor-tagged cdnas are combined in a 1: <dig> ratio and used as a template for pcr using the asp and a gene-specific primer . accordingly, pcr products derived from the two cdna templates differ in size and can be separated by gel electrophoresis. the changes in relative expression can be determined from the ratio of the two peaks. remarkably, atac-pcr is totally free from laborious steps for the preparation of competitor standards, flexibly applicable to any gene set ranging from a small to a genome-wide scale, and proven highly accurate and sensitive in relative quantification of eukaryotic gene expression  <cit> . if an equimolar mixture of all cdnas becomes available, atac-pcr can be readily used for absolute quantification of the transcriptome.

however, it is practically difficult to have such an "abundance-normalized" copy of the transcriptome. we thus pursued an alternative but practical solution that uses genomic dna as a competitor standard in atac-pcr. since genomic dna isolated from non-dividing cells is guaranteed to contain every gene exactly at the same copy number , it can serve as an ideal standard to normalize different amplification efficiencies among amplicons. competitive pcr between genomic dna and cdna on a genome-wide scale would immediately provide stoichiometric composition data of the transcriptome, which can be converted to absolute value with an appropriate calibration.

to achieve this goal, atac-pcr has to be improved so that it can be applied to any restriction fragment derived from either genomic or complementary dnas, since the original protocol is applicable only to the 3'-end restriction fragment of each cdna  <cit> . in addition, to convert the stoichiometric composition data to absolute quantification data, we need an independent method for data calibration. finally, to describe the results in terms of copy number per cell, we have to determine the total amount of rnas per cell.

in this study, we first investigated the methods 1) to fully extract and determine the amount of total rnas, 2) to competitively amplify target gene fragment from genomic and complementary dnas, and 3) to measure internal standards for the calibration of competitive pcr data. then, we integrated these methods to precisely measure absolute expression levels of selected mrnas in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to validate our approach. finally, we constructed a large-scale competitive pcr system for genome-wide absolute quantification of the budding yeast transcriptome. the results revealed that the yeast transcriptome is composed of twice or more as many mrnas as has been believed for the last  <dig> years.

RESULTS
total amount of rna in budding yeast cells
to determine the exact amount of total rnas and to extract them as thoroughly as possible, we tested several methods for rna extraction from the budding yeast s. cerevisiae. a hot-phenol-based method  <cit>  was found to be the best in both its yield and reproducibility. we also tested a classical destructive method to calculate the total amount of cellular rnas  <cit> , in which naoh treatment was employed to hydrolyze all rnas into mononucleotides. both methods indicated that an average amount of cellular rnas is  <dig> ~ <dig>  pg per cell , although the destructive method always showed a slightly higher value than the hot-phenol method, as it did than a method based on radioisotope labeling  <cit> . we used the value obtained by the hot-phenol method hereinafter.

total amount of cellular rnas  was determined for three independent preparations of s288c cells grown in ypd medium using a modified hot-phenol method  <cit>  and naoh/pca method  <cit> .

generalized adaptor-tagged competitive pcr 
to apply the principle of atac-pcr to any restriction fragment derived from either genomic dna or cdna, we employed a y-shaped adaptor  <cit>  . note that this adaptor lacks any sequence complementary to asp. accordingly, priming from the asp never occurs, unless the extended product from a gsp reaches the end of the adaptor to provide the sequence complementary to the asp. thus, in contrast to conventional double-stranded adaptors leading to global amplification of adaptor-tagged templates, the y-shaped adaptor should restrict amplification to occur only from adaptor-tagged fragments to which a gsp hybridizes, thereby ensuring selective amplification dependent on the gsp .

the y-shaped adaptor a/c or b/c was prepared by annealing equal molar amounts of the forward oligonucleotide a or b and the reverse oligonucleotide c, respectively. the sequence shared by the adaptor specific primer  and the adaptors is shown in bold. complementary sequences between the forward and reverse oligonucleotides are underlined.

we succeeded in specific amplification of target genes from y-shaped adaptor-tagged templates . the products were separated and detected using an abi  <dig> multi-capillary dna sequencer. note that we used two y-shaped adaptors to introduce 5-nt artificial fragment length polymorphism between cognate pcr products . furthermore, the amplification was highly reproducible and quantitative from either genomic dna or cdna . these results indicate that the introduction of the y-shaped adaptors does not compromise the highly quantitative nature of atac-pcr. we termed this method as "generalized" adaptor-tagged competitive pcr or gatc-pcr.

we next examined whether gatc-pcr can competitively amplify its target from a mixture of genomic and cdna templates. for this experiment, we spiked different amounts of in vitro transcribed gcn <dig> mrna to total rnas extracted from a strain deleted for gcn <dig>  thereby preparing a series of total rna samples that differ solely in the concentration of gcn <dig> mrna. we converted these rnas into adaptor-tagged cdna templates using the adaptor b/c , mixed each of the cdna templates with genomic dna of the parental gcn <dig> strain tagged with the other adaptor a/c , and amplified a gcn <dig> fragment by gatc-pcr.  the results of amplification from three independent templates are shown in figure 2a. although the assay showed excellent linearity in every case, the levels of output varied. nevertheless, the ratio between the signals for gcn <dig> and endogenous act <dig> was kept constant among the three experiments . we assumed that, although the three templates differ in yield, they share almost identical relative composition. this assumption was later confirmed by a large-scale measurement . thus, it is necessary to calibrate the results of gatc-pcr using an independent method.

calibration of gatc-pcr data
we designed a system to calibrate gatc-pcr data based on a competitive pcr that uses a unique series of standard rnas . the amplicon shared among these standards was made  <dig> nt longer than the one from the target, so that we could separate them by gel electrophoresis for quantification. each standard rna was prepared by in vitro transcription from a template prepared by modifying a full-length cdna clone  <cit> . accordingly, the 3' terminus of the each standard rna including poly tail is likely to be similar to that of target rna, and we can expect a similar efficiency of reverse transcription between the standards and the target. the most prominent feature of the standards is that each of them is differentially 5'-truncated to retain a unique set of priming sites for the forward primers f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig> . pcr with f <dig> and r <dig> primers generates a long product derived solely from standard 1; pcr using f <dig> and r <dig> generates a mid-length product derived from standards  <dig> and 2; pcr using f <dig> and r <dig> generates a short product derived from all of the standards. thus, if the concentrations of the standards  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are set as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> copies per cell, the amounts of the long, mid-length, and short products indicate the expression levels of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> copies per cell, respectively . among these points, one can use those close to the expression level of a target of interest for its quantification.

we used this scheme to measure the amount of gcn <dig> mrna in three independent preparations of yeast cells grown in the rich medium ypd to find that each cell contains approximately  <dig> copies of gcn <dig> mrna on average . these results were consistent with those obtained by northern blot hybridization  and real-time pcr , both using an in vitro transcribed gcn <dig> mrna as a standard. thus, we decided to use the value obtained by this method for calibration of gatc-pcr data hereinafter.

copy number of gcn <dig> mrna per cell was determined for the same samples as those in table  <dig> using the competitive pcr method using a set of in vitro transcribed rna standards shown in figure 2b.

absolute quantification of budding yeast mrnas
to cover the wide expression range of the budding yeast genes  <cit> , we conducted gatc-pcr using three different ratios of genomic dna to cdna , which would be suitable for quantification of mrnas expressed around the levels of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> copies per cell, respectively. the data obtained at these three measuring points were averaged by putting more weight on the one having the smallest absolute value of log-converted cdna/genomic dna signal ratio. for calibration, we used the expression level of gcn <dig> mrna determined as described above . on the other hand, we used the same rna for real-time pcr assays, for which we prepared in vitro transcribed rnas as the standard of each gene to be measured. then, we compared the results of gatc-pcr and real-time pcr for eight genes. as shown in figure 2c, the results of gatc-pcr were found to be highly consistent with those of real-time pcr, providing a proof-of-principle for absolute quantification by gatc-pcr between genomic dna and cdna.

large-scale absolute quantification of the yeast transcriptome
to expand the gatc-pcr to a genome-wide scale, we designed gsps for all of the  <dig>  yeast genes bearing mbo i sites in their open reading frames . for this purpose, we fully exploited the sdss algorithm that we had developed to design highly specific pcr primers based on the stability and uniqueness of 3'-end subsequences  <cit> . to evaluate how each primer can quantitatively work in the assay, we examined all the  <dig>  primers in gatc-pcr using a series of templates, in each of which two genomic dna samples tagged with different adaptors were mixed at a known ratio. we plotted the observed signal ratios against the theoretical ones to evaluate the performance of each primer  to find that  <dig>  primers  worked satisfactorily . we thus decided to use these validated primers for genome-wide quantification.

to accelerate the analysis on the abi  <dig> dna sequencer, we used four fluorescent dyes to label the asp, combined four pcr products obtained using the four differentially labeled asps prior to electrophoresis, and detected them via the four optical channels of the sequencer . we developed a program for automatic detection of peak pairs, each of which consists of a peak derived from the genomic dna and a peak derived from the cdna. note that the former is  <dig> nt shorter than the latter because of the design of the two adaptors used for tagging of genomic and complementary dna templates . we also developed a software tool to reveal the identity of each peak.

we used the same rna sample twice for genome-wide measurement to examine overall reproducibility of gatc-pcr as a technical replicate. as shown in figure 3a, the gatc-pcr system reproducibly measured the expression levels for most genes . from inspection of individual off-diagonal data points, we learned that error in peak identification was the major cause of irreproducibility . when the signal ratio between the longer and shorter amplicons was high, a fraction of the former occasionally renatured and migrated faster or very closely to the latter, thereby making the quantification inaccurate.

we used the three independent rna preparations from the cells grown in ypd medium for genome-wide quantification as biological replicates . we successfully measured more than 90% of the  <dig>  genes, for which we could design validated gsps, each time and 97% of them  at least once in the three measurements. for the remaining  <dig> genes, we failed to detect their expression in all of the three measurements. total copy number of mrnas for these  <dig>  genes was estimated to be  <dig>  per cell. if we assume no expression of the  <dig> genes and extrapolate the result to all of the  <dig>  yeast genes, which include  <dig>  verified and  <dig>  uncharacterized orfs but not  <dig> dubious ones  <cit> , the total copy number of mrnas is estimated to be  <dig>  per cell. this is remarkably different from the prevailing estimate or  <dig>  copies per cell, which is based on a classical r0t analysis of the cells grown in a rich medium  <cit>  . the data also illustrate a skewed composition of the yeast transcriptome : transcripts ranked within the top  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and 59% in terms of abundance exist at the level exceeding  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> copies per cell to share 43%, 73%, and 96% of total mrnas, respectively.

total copy number of mrnas was calculated for the  <dig>  genes whose gsps were validated for quantification . the same rna samples as those shown in table  <dig> were used for gatc-pcr quantification. note that we excluded the genes whose expression levels were called to be zero from the calculation, because we could not distinguish between the genes that we failed to amplify from the cdna template and those that were expressed at undetectable levels. thus, the number of "genes quantified" in the table should be regarded as the most conservative or minimum estimate. to minimize the effect of failed assays, we merged the three datasets to cover  <dig>  genes measured at least once in the three measurements and calculated the total copy number from the average copy number of each of these genes.

we next intended to measure the absolute levels of mrnas in the same strain grown in the minimum medium sd. however, we found that the amount of total rnas extracted with the hot-phenol procedure  from these cells was much smaller than the one measured by the naoh/pca method  for unknown reasons. since none of the methods that we tested improved the yield, we used rnas extracted with the hot-phenol method for the experiment but used the value obtained by the naoh/pca method for the calculation of copy number. we successfully measured the expression levels of  <dig>  genes and calibrated the data to conclude that the total copy number of mrnas for these genes was  <dig>  per cell .

we compared the absolute expression levels of  <dig>  genes between the cells grown in ypd and sd media . as expected from the total copy numbers, most genes were less abundantly expressed in cells grown in sd medium than in those grown in ypd medium. the down-regulation was particularly prominent for a group of genes that were expressed above the level of  <dig> copies per cell under the rich condition , which could account for the decrease of ~ <dig>  copies per cell, or ~40% of the transcripts measured in the cells grown in ypd medium. these genes could also be recognized as a shoulder in the plot between the number of genes and absolute expression levels in the cells under the rich condition . the majority of these genes are, as expected, those encoding ribosomal proteins . on the other hand, a group of genes were more abundantly expressed under the poor condition than the rich condition. genes involved in biosynthesis of amino acids were significantly enriched in this group.

discussion
the absolute copy number of each macromolecule can be considered a gold standard for the description of a biological system. it is thus ideal to describe the composition of a transcriptome on the scale of absolute number of each rna species. this would not only accelerate data exchange and integration but provide a precise picture of the transcriptome, which may be overlooked in a ratiometric or relative quantification analysis. for instance, global mrna changes occur in heat-shocked mammalian cells, those under serum-starvation, and yeast cells at the stationary phase. in these cases, conventional microarray analysis, which usually assumes no changes in the total amount of mrna, resulted in the false classification of thousands of genes as differentially expressed  <cit> . even small global shifts in mrna populations were shown to mislead the interpretation of ratiometric expression data, unless carefully designed external controls are included  <cit> . by contrast, absolute quantification is highly sensitive to global changes and totally free from these concerns, thereby greatly helping one to precisely grasp and properly interpret the transcriptome.

for absolute quantification of transcriptome, an equimolar mixture of mrnas for all genes would serve as an ideal standard. although theoretically possible, it is practically difficult to prepare such an "abundance-normalized transcriptome" from expression-ready full-length cdna clones. thus, we employed an alternative method that uses genomic dna isolated from non-dividing cells as a standard, since every gene is contained in exactly the same copy number or abundance-normalized in the genome.

we used an atac-pcr approach as the method of quantification, because it is highly accurate, robust, totally free from tedious steps for the preparation of individual competitor standards, and hence applicable to various scales of quantification. since the original atac-pcr can be applied only to the 3'-end restriction fragment, we introduced y-shaped adaptors in the protocol to develop gatc-pcr that can analyze any restriction fragment derived from either genomic or complementary dnas with high accuracy . using the gatc-pcr and a unique competitive pcr assay for data calibration, we succeeded in accurate absolute quantification of yeast mrnas .

genomic dna has been used as a cohybridization standard in ratiometric microarrays to accelerate data comparison  <cit> . however, it has remained unclear whether single-stranded cdnas and double-stranded genomic dnas can be labeled and hybridized with the same efficiency. no rigorous examination of accuracy has thus far been provided in terms of absolute quantification. by contrast, dna fragments to be compared in gatc-pcr, one from genomic dna and the other from cdna, share the same structure except for a subtle sequence difference in the tagged adaptors , thereby being free from the problems of differential efficiency in labeling and hybridization. indeed, the accuracy of this approach was demonstrated in this study.

gatc-pcr can be flexibly applied to quantification experiments of any gene set ranging from a small to a genome-wide scale. however, its application to a genome-wide analysis has several practical drawbacks: it requires a large number of primers to be designed and synthesized, pcr, and capillary electrophoresis runs. in terms of cost, it is desirable to reduce the volume in current pcr , because it is too much for detection by the dna sequencer, which requires only  <dig> nl of the reaction. however, we failed to reduce the volume further, while maintaining a sufficient success rate of pcr. in addition, current throughput of the capillary dna sequencer is not sufficient for multiple measurements. another concern would be its applicability to organisms bearing larger and intron-rich genomes. we assume it plausible, at least, for genes bearing appropriate exonic restriction sites, since we confirmed that highly specific primers designed by appropriate algorithms  <cit>  enabled gatc-pcr between human genomic dna and cdna . it should be noted that, beside absolute quantification of mrnas, gatc-pcr would also be applicable to relative quantification of splicing variants as well as copy number variation in genomic dnas.

we applied the gatc-pcr to absolute quantification of the budding yeast transcriptome. the results indicate that the transcriptome contains ~ <dig>  mrnas under a nutrient-rich condition . this result was striking, because the yeast has been generally believed to contain  <dig>  copies of poly+ rna molecules per cell based on the result of r0t analysis  <cit> . why do these two estimates differ so greatly?

to answer this question, we revisited the process in which the previous estimate was obtained  <cit> . the study divided mass quantity of poly+ rnas by that of an average mrna to obtain the total copy number. the amount of poly+ rnas was assumed to be  <dig> % of total rnas from the result of r0t analysis, and the average length of mrnas was assumed to be  <dig>  nt. notably, the amount of total rnas used for the calculation was not experimentally determined but deduced from the total amount of dna by using an assumption that the ratio of rna to dna in the yeast is  <dig>  <cit> . according to this classical assumption, the amount of total rnas per cell was calculated to be  <dig>  pg, which is remarkably smaller than the  <dig>  pg reported in recent literature  <cit>  and obtained by our measurements . we also examined the average length of mrna. the average length of budding yeast orfs in the saccharomyces genome database  <cit>  is  <dig>  nt. the median lengths of 5'/3'-untranslated regions revealed by tiling array hybridization  <cit>  and rna-seq  <cit>  were reported to be  <dig> nt/ <dig> nt and  <dig> nt/ <dig> nt, respectively. thus, the average length of mrna is  <dig>  nt, coincident with the previous estimate  <cit> . however, it should be noted that a significant negative correlation was observed between expression level and orf length in the budding yeast  <cit> . indeed, the average size of the yeast orfs can be as short as  <dig>  nt and  <dig>  nt when weighted by the copy numbers calculated from signal intensity of high-density dna microarray  <cit>  and gatc-pcr results, respectively. thus, the average length of mrna should be regarded as ~ <dig>  nt rather than  <dig>  nt.

taken together, the previous study used  <dig> -fold smaller mass amount of mrnas and  <dig> -fold larger mrna size, thereby leading to an approximately 2-fold underestimation of total copy number. in other words, interpretation of the classical r0t results with correct parameters led to an estimated total copy number of ~ <dig> , which is in good agreement with the estimate from gatc-pcr or ~ <dig> .

it is intriguing to note that the total number of mrnas in the yeast transcriptome can be larger than the current estimate, because recent studies uncovered the presence of unannotated rna species including intergenic transcripts, antisense transcripts, and those starting from inside the orfs  <cit> . a single gsp conceivably quantifies not only the target mrna but its antisense and/or internally primed transcripts, although these rnas are generally several-fold less abundant than mrna. for more accurate quantification or, at least, careful interpretation of the data, it is crucial to elucidate the structure of each transcription unit in the yeast genome.

we used the gatc-pcr to compare transcriptome between the yeast cells grown under rich and poor conditions or in ypd and sd media, respectively . notably, the sizes of the transcriptome differ significantly between the two conditions: the total copy number of mrna under the poor condition is approximately half of that under the rich condition, largely because of a drastic decrease in a group of the most abundant mrnas encoding ribosomal proteins. these results well illustrate how dynamically the yeast transcriptome can be reorganized upon environmental changes. absolute quantification would precisely detect such changes, thereby leading to proper interpretation of the transcriptome.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a method termed gatc-pcr to accurately measure absolute expression levels of mrnas by means of competitive amplification of genomic and cdna copies of each gene fragment. absolute quantification of mrnas using a large-scale gatc-pcr analysis indicated that the budding yeast transcriptome is composed of twice or more as many mrnas as previously estimated. the method would be flexibly applicable to both targeted and genome-wide analyses of absolute expression levels of mrnas.
