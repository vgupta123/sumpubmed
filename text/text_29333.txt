BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. in addition to causing disease in humans, this microorganism can colonize a variety of domestic animals, common and exotic pets, and domestic and wild birds; some of these alternate hosts experience disease  <cit> . successful experimental colonization of several mouse strains with c. jejuni has been reported, but disease does not occur unless mice are immunodeficient or wild type mice are experimentally manipulated  <cit> .

clinical presentation of campylobacteriosis in human patients in industrialized countries usually varies from mild watery diarrhea to severe bloody diarrhea; in developing countries, milder diarrhea and asymptomatic infections are also seen  <cit> . bacteremia can occur. antecedent c. jejuni infection has been associated with the development of reactive arthritis and the autoimmune neuropathies guillain barré and miller fisher syndromes. disease expression in humans is likely the result of complex interactions between pathogen genetic properties, host genetic properties, host physiological state and immune response, and the host intestinal microbiota  <cit> . environmental factors such as host diet may affect one or more of these factors; diet variables may act through mechanisms such as modulation of the host immune system by fatty acids or alteration of the composition of the complex microbial populations of the lower gi tract  <cit> .

c. jejuni is a genetically variable organism  <cit> . over  <dig> sequence types are cataloged in the campylobacter jejuni multi locus sequence typing  database  <cit> , and numerous studies employing other typing methods such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms  in an array of genes, amplified fragment length polymorphisms, and microarray-based comparisons of entire genomes have consistently revealed substantial genetic variation  <cit> . furthermore, genetic variation has been documented in a number of virulence determinants, including genes involved in motility, iron metabolism, toxin synthesis and secretion, adherence to and invasion of eukaryotic cells, and capsule and lipo-oligosaccharide  synthesis  <cit> . genetic variation affecting gene expression has been directly linked to in vivo variation in pathogenicity of two otherwise very similar strains from poultry  <cit> .

c. jejuni also possesses mechanisms that could be expected to generate genetic diversity in vivo. mlst data, based on analysis of dna sequences of genes for proteins of central metabolic pathways, have been used to deduce that recombination occurs in natural c. jejuni populations, both within c. jejuni and between c. jejuni and the closely related c. coli  <cit> , although estimates of the frequency of recombination vary with the method of analysis used and/or with the type of population studied. de boer et al.  <cit>  demonstrated in vivo genetic exchange between c. jejuni strains coinfecting chickens. phase variation via slip-strand mutagenesis in homopolymeric tracts has been demonstrated in a motility-related gene  <cit> , a capsular synthesis gene  <cit> , and a lipo-oligosaccharide  synthesis gene  <cit> . in the latter case, phase variation results in switching the genes encoding the los structure between forms mimicking gm <dig> or gm <dig> gangliosides found in neural tissue; it is thought that the reaction with neural tissue of autoimmune antibodies directed against los molecules that mimic neural gangliosides underlies the development of guillain-barré and miller fisher syndromes. prendergast et al. demonstrated in vivo phase variation in the los genes in experimentally infected human volunteers  <cit> .

evolutionary changes in pathogenicity of pathogens  are thought to be the result of trade-offs between host mortality and probability of transmission to a new host, although immunopathology resulting from damage caused by the immune response may modulate the selective process  <cit> . both host and pathogen genetic factors may be important in the evolutionary process  <cit> . serial passage experiments that explore virulence evolution have usually resulted in increased pathogen-induced damage to the host  <cit> . a few serial passage experiments have been conducted with c. jejuni. fernández et al.  <cit>  showed that serial intraperitoneal passage in mice of ten c. jejuni strains that could not invade hep <dig> cells in culture restored and then enhanced this ability, but pathogenicity of the passaged strains in intestinal infections of mice was not determined. chickens are commensally colonized by c. jejuni and are an important reservoir for human infection. ringoir and korolik  <cit>  showed that serial passage of four c. jejuni strains in chickens reduced the minimum infectious dose required for colonization. jones et al.  <cit>  showed that passage of a poorly motile variant of c. jejuni  <dig> in chickens increased the ability of this strain to colonize and persist in chickens; this change was accompanied by an increase in motility.

development of a murine model of c. jejuni infection in which c57bl/ <dig> il-10+/+ mice are colonized by c. jejuni  <dig> while c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice are both colonized and experience enteritis allowed us to explore the relationship between genetic variation in c. jejuni and disease expression in a model in which host genetic factors are close to identical and host environmental factors can be either standardized or varied in a controlled way  <cit> . our first hypothesis was that c. jejuni strains from humans, chickens, and cattle vary in their ability to colonize and cause enteritis in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice. our second hypothesis was that serial passage of c. jejuni strains in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice would increase the ability of the passaged strains to cause enteritis in mice. the data obtained supported both of these hypotheses. furthermore, during the course of these experiments, it became apparent that dietary factors can also influence disease expression in this mouse model.

RESULTS
five experiments are reported here. experiment  <dig> comprised genetic comparisons of seven c. jejuni strains by multilocus sequence typing and restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of known and putative virulence loci. experiment  <dig> comprised four serial passages of each of five c. jejuni strains in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice. the final passage in experiment  <dig> also included  a comparison of passaged strains with unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig> and  a comparison of mice infected with unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig> kept on an ~12% fat breeder diet and mice infected with unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig> experiencing a transition from the ~12% fat breeder diet to an ~6% fat maintenance diet just prior to inoculation. experiment  <dig> was suggested by the results of experiment  <dig> and comprised a whole orf microarray comparison of the gene content of c. jejuni strains  <dig> and nw. experiment  <dig> was also suggested by the results of experiment  <dig> and comprised a short term  infection study of passaged and unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig> strains to determine whether there were any differences in ability of the strains to cause enteritis immediately after infection. experiment  <dig> was suggested by the results of the dietary comparison included in the final passage of experiment  <dig> and comprised a comparison of mice infected with unpassaged c. jejuni 11168; mice were kept on the ~12% fat diet throughout the experiment, were kept on the ~6% fat diet throughout the experiment, or were subjected to a transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet just prior to inoculation.

c. jejuni strains used in this study were genetically variable in both housekeeping genes and virulence determinants 
the seven c. jejuni strains used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  they represent six mlst sequence types in six clonal complexes and were chosen in part so as to span the genetic diversity of the strains characterized by mlst by sails et al.  <cit> . an mlst-based neighbor-joining tree displaying the genetic relationships of these strains to each other and to reference strains for the major c. jejuni clonal complexes is shown in figure 1a; the tree includes mlst sequences for reference strains of major clonal complexes established by wareing et al.  <cit> . sequences for the reference strains and all strains used in this study except strain nw were obtained from the campylobacter jejuni mlst database  <cit> . mlst typing of strain nw was carried out in our laboratory  and the clonal complex determined using the campylobacter jejuni mlst database. the two strains that were unable to colonize the mice at levels detectable by culture  both clustered at a distance from each other and from the colonizing strains; the colonizing strains clustered together with the strain that colonized but did not produce disease.

the seven strains were assayed by polymerase chain reaction  with gene-specific primers for the presence of a number of known or putative virulence determinants for which presence/absence variation had previously been documented in epidemiological studies . none of the strains were pcr-positive for the plasmid-borne virb <dig> gene; as a control for the pcr assay, we verified the presence of the virb <dig> gene in strain 81– <dig>  which carries the pvir plasmid  <cit> . strains d <dig>  d <dig>  and nw were pcr-negative for the iam marker; strain d <dig> was also pcr-negative for the wlan gene. restriction fragment polymorphism  analysis was performed on pcr products of the flaa, los, cdtabc, ceue, plda, ciab, dnaj, and cgtb genes of these strains. the resulting banding patterns were used to generate the neighbor-joining tree shown in figure 1b. the two strains that were unable to colonize the mice at levels detectable by culture again clustered at a distance from each other and from the colonizing strains. strains  <dig> and d <dig> were identical in the rflp analysis of virulence-associated loci but rather different in mlst. similarly, strains d <dig> and d <dig> had very similar rflp patterns but appeared in different mlst clusters.

c. jejuni strains differed in their ability to colonize and cause enteritis in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice in the initial passage of experiment  <dig> 
mice were infected with total doses of ~ <dig> ×  <dig> cfu c. jejuni, housed individually for 30– <dig> days, and then euthanized and necropsied as previously described  <cit> . c. jejuni cells in wet mounts of all suspensions used to inoculate mice were highly motile. mice were evaluated twice daily for clinical signs of disease and euthanized promptly if severe clinical signs were observed. fecal samples were taken on days  <dig> or  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  and at necropsy and spread on medium selective for c. jejuni . additional detailed colonization data are presented in additional file  <dig> . as shown in the summary in table  <dig>  five of the seven strains were able to colonize the mice;c. jejuni could be cultured from the feces of 5/ <dig> mice inoculated with strains  <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  and nw on all days of sampling and from tissue and fecal samples obtained at necropsy . strains  <dig> and d <dig> were never recovered by culture from fecal samples taken during the course of infection  or from tissues or feces collected at necropsy . strain  <dig> dna was present at low levels in multiple tissues collected at necropsy as shown by pcr assay for the c. jejuni gyra gene  <cit>  performed on dna extracted from tissues, but strain d <dig> was only weakly detected in two tissue samples by pcr assay . cultures were verified using the same pcr assay.

* the following gross pathological changes were recorded: enlarged ileocecocolic lymph nodes, thickened colon wall, and presence of blood in the intestinal lumen.

further evidence that strains  <dig> and d <dig> were unable to persistently colonize the mice is provided by the fact that while all five of the colonizing strains evoked circulating igg2b antibody responses, the two non-colonizing strains evoked little or no antibody as shown in figure  <dig>  igg2b accounts for the bulk of the antibody response of c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice to c. jejuni  <cit> .

all five colonizing strains were able to cause some gross pathological changes observed at necropsy, including enlarged ileocecocolic lymph nodes, thickened colon wall, and bloody contents in the intestinal lumen . the most common gross pathological change was the occurrence of enlarged ileocecocolic lymph nodes. in previous experiments, in about one-third of c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice infected with non-adapted c. jejuni  <dig>  the only gross pathological change observed was an enlarged ileocecocolic lymph node and the histopathology score at the ileocecocolic junction was ≤  <dig> . four of the five colonizing strains were able to produce histopathological changes at the ileocecocolic junction that resulted in a histopathology score ≥  <dig> in at least one mouse in the initial passage .  were evaluated separately for indicators of inflammation such as excess mucus, tissue hyperplasia, tissue architecture and integrity, infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils, edema, fibrosis, and vasculitis. characters contributed to a score that ranged from  <dig> to 44; scores less than  <dig> were considered normal.)

three c. jejuni strains caused more severe enteritis following serial passage 
for colonizing c. jejuni strains, the initial results described above were obtained in the first of four serial passages. for subsequent passages, c. jejuni growth from cecal tissue of each individual mouse was harvested and used as the inoculum for the next serial passage. all of the c. jejuni growth from the ceca of all mice inoculated with a single strain was pooled to produce the inoculum for the next passage. in passages  <dig> through  <dig>  five mice were inoculated with each c. jejuni strain; ten mice were inoculated with each strain in passage  <dig> 

as noted below , in this series of experiments, mice in the first passage were inadvertently shifted from diets containing ~12% fat to ~6% fat just prior to c. jejuni infection for the first passage. this error was not discovered until after the mice had been infected. a previous experiment that allowed a direct comparison of c. jejuni  <dig> infected c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice on the ~12% fat diet and adapted to the ~6% fat diet for at least two weeks prior to infection did not reveal a statistically significant difference in survival, gross pathology or histopathology . therefore, all subsequent passages included a similar dietary shift prior to inoculation in order to maintain constant dietary conditions in the mice across the four serial passages.

during the first three passages of the serial passage experiment, fecal c. jejuni populations were monitored by plating on c. jejuni selective medium; population sizes were scored on a semi-quantitative scale with ranks from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  . briefly, colonization was scored as  <dig> if plates had no c. jejuni cfu, level  <dig> if plates had <  <dig> cfu, level  <dig> if plates had >  <dig> but <  <dig> cfu, level  <dig> if plates had >  <dig> cfu, and level  <dig> if plates were covered with a lawn of c. jejuni. two-way anova was performed on the ranked colonization data from the first three passages with the holm-Šidák test for post hoc comparisons. for all strains except d <dig>  ranked population sizes varied with the day of sampling . in the four strains where significant differences were found, populations at the time of necropsy in almost all passages were larger than those on days  <dig> or  <dig> and sometimes larger than those on days  <dig> or  <dig>  for strain  <dig>  population sizes on day  <dig> or  <dig> were significantly different from those both on day  <dig> or  <dig> and at the time of necropsy ; population sizes on day  <dig> or  <dig> were not significantly different from those at the time of necropsy. furthermore, significant differences in fecal population sizes between passages were found for strains  <dig>  d <dig>  and nw. for strain  <dig>  the comparison between passages was significant for the comparison of passage  <dig> to both passages  <dig> and  <dig>  and for the comparison of passages  <dig> and  <dig> . for strains d <dig> and nw, only the comparison between passages  <dig> and  <dig> was significant .

the fraction of mice harboring c. jejuni in the jejunum also increased over the serial passage experiments for strains  <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> . for strains  <dig> and d <dig>  this fraction increased from 60% and 40%, respectively, to 100% after one passage in mice; for strain d <dig>  this fraction increased from 60% to 100% between the third and final passages. the changes in these proportions were significant by fisher's exact test . in previous experiments, the jejunum was colonized in 30–60% of mice infected for 28– <dig> days with unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig>  <cit> . at the time of necropsy, levels of c. jejuni colonization in the cecum, the site where c. jejuni populations are highest and most consistent, were estimated on a semi-quantitative scale  <cit>  and were similar for all five colonizing strains in all passages .

in the first passage, all mice inoculated with all c. jejuni strains survived through the entire  <dig> days of the experiment. in the second passage, some mice inoculated with strains  <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> required early euthanasia due to severe clinical disease .  microbiology research unit food and waterborne diseases integrated research network-sponsored animal model phenome database website http://www.shigatox.net/cgi-bin/mru/mi004). in the third passage, some mice inoculated with these strains and with strain d <dig> required early euthanasia. in addition, the time between inoculation and the development of severe clinical disease requiring euthanasia decreased steadily over the second and third passages for strains  <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig>  in all passages, all mice inoculated with strain nw survived for the full duration of the experiment . kaplan meier log-rank survival analysis was conducted on the data for each strain from the four passages, although the number of animals  in each data set was low. results were significant for strain d <dig>  but not for strains  <dig>  d <dig>  or d <dig> . no mice infected with strain nw required early euthanasia.

the fraction of mice exhibiting gross pathology in the gastrointestinal tract on necropsy  increased during serial passage of three of the five strains. the increased occurrence of bloody contents in the gi tract lumen was a significant change from our observations in previous experiments . the severity of gross pathology, particularly the fraction of mice exhibiting bloody contents in the intestinal lumen , increased in passaged strains  <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> but not in passaged strains d <dig> or nw . in previous experiments, one of  <dig> c. jejuni  <dig> infected c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice had bloody contents in the intestinal lumen , whereas in the second and subsequent passages in this experiment,  <dig> of  <dig>  mice infected with passaged strains had this pathology. the single control mouse  having gross pathology and a high histopathology score tested negative for c. jejuni by both culture and pcr; it was thus a case of spontaneous colitis, which sometimes occurs in il-10-deficient mice  <cit> . none of the  <dig> uninfected c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice with spontaneous colitis that we have observed in either our breeding colony or in experiments have exhibited bloody contents in the gut lumen. for each passaged c. jejuni strain, kruskal wallis anova was performed to determine whether differences in the level of gross pathology in mice from the four different passages of that strain were statistically significant; results were significant for strain d <dig>  but not for strains  <dig>  d <dig>  or d <dig> .

median histopathology scores increased during serial passage of strains  <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig>  but not strains d <dig> and nw. this increase occurred after the first passage in strains  <dig> and d <dig> and after the third passage in strain d <dig>  the median histopathology score rose to over  <dig> in mice infected with strains  <dig>  d <dig>  and d2600; in previous experiments, the median histopathology score for mice infected with non-mouse-adapted c. jejuni  <dig> ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . strain d <dig> produced high histology scores in a few mice in the first, third and fourth passages, but the median score did not rise above  <dig>  for each passaged c. jejuni strain, kruskal wallis anova on ranks was performed to determine whether differences in the level of gross pathology in mice from the four different passages of that strain were statistically significant; results were significant for strain d <dig>  but not for strains  <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  or nw . when post hoc multiple comparisons on the data for strain d <dig> were done using the holm-Šidák procedure, the result was significant for the comparison of histopathology scores of mice in passage  <dig> compared to the scores of mice in passage  <dig> .

histopathology scores were also analyzed using the mantel test for trends with correction for continuity  <cit> ; for this test, data were cast in a two-way table for each c. jejuni strain according to the number of the serial passage of the strain and the number of animals exhibiting lesions of grades  <dig> and  <dig> combined  compared to the number of animals exhibiting lesions of grade  <dig> . the choice to divide the data in this way for this analysis was made because of the marked increase noted above in the median histopathology scores of c. jejuni  <dig> infected mice: from grade  <dig> in previous experiments to grade  <dig> after serial passage. the tests for trends were statistically significant for strains  <dig> , d <dig> , and d <dig> . the test was not significant for strain d <dig>  and could not be conducted for strain nw since there were no nw-infected mice having histopathology scores in grade  <dig> 

dna:dna microarrray comparison of c. jejuni strains  <dig> and nw  revealed differences between the strains
because strain nw was able to colonize c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice but did not cause severe enteritis in the initial infection and did not evolve to a higher level of pathogenicity during repeated passages, we elected to examine its genetic content more closely by comparing it to the highly pathogenic strain  <dig> using an in-house full open reading frame  microarray with coverage of 95% of the c. jejuni  <dig> genome  <cit> . the microarray was constructed using pcr products synthesized using primers for sequence-validated orfs developed by parrish et al.  <cit>  and genomic dna from strain  <dig>  we hypothesized that known virulence determinants would be among the genes present in strain  <dig> but absent from strain nw.

sixty-nine c. jejuni  <dig> orfs were identified as possibly absent in strain nw by genomotyping  analysis of microarray data  <cit> . fifty-four of the  <dig> orfs were confirmed to be absent or strongly divergent by pcr assay ; pcr products of the appropriate size were obtained for thirteen of the remaining orfs. many of the orfs missing in strain nw belong to complex loci encoding surface structures known both to be involved in c. jejuni pathogenesis and to be highly variable in gene content ;  <cit> ). nine additional orfs may encode membrane proteins; three may encode dna restriction and modification proteins. four periplasmic proteins were absent or strongly divergent in strain nw, along with seven orfs having other known or putative functions and  <dig> orfs encoding hypothetical proteins for which no function could be suggested  <cit> .

for two orfs, cj 0987c  and cj0874c , strain nw dna yielded pcr products smaller than those produced from strain  <dig> dna. sequencing of the pcr products from strain nw showed that cj0987c had a  <dig> bp deletion  compared to strain  <dig>  orf cj0874c in strain nw had a  <dig> bp deletion  compared to strain  <dig>  genbank accession numbers for these sequences are fj <dig> and fj <dig> 

early course of infection was not altered by serial passage of c. jejuni  <dig> 
the observation that fecal c. jejuni  <dig> population sizes increased during the course of infection, the significant increase in fecal population sizes of this strain with passage, and the earlier onset of severe enteritis that occurred during passage of c. jejuni strain  <dig> led us to hypothesize that serial passage might have selected for variants that were more proficient in growth in the host immediately after infection and/or in early initiation of the disease process. therefore, we infected mice with passaged and unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig> and compared levels of colonization, gross pathology, and histopathology in the two groups  <dig> hours after infection. the results did not support the hypothesis. mice infected with the two strains did not differ in colonization at different sites in the gi tract  or in colonizing population sizes . four of ten mice infected with unpassaged and four of ten mice infected with passaged c. jejuni  <dig> exhibited slightly enlarged lymph nodes; all mice had minimal histopathology scores between  <dig> and  <dig> .

adaptive humoral immune responses were not consistently affected by passage of c. jejuni strains 
elisa tests were performed to characterize the adaptive immune responses of the mice to the evolving strains ; the antigen for all of these assays was prepared from non-adapted  c. jejuni  <dig>  the response of c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice to c. jejuni was previously shown to be dominated by th1-associated antibodies, predominantly igg2b  <cit> ; the same result was obtained for the other colonizing strains. there were a few cases in which anti-c. jejuni igg subclass antibody titers were significantly decreased in the serum of mice infected with the passaged strain in the last passage compared to the initial passage. anti-c. jejuni iga titers were significantly lower in mice infected with three of the five passaged strains  in the last passage compared to the initial passage; however, of those three strains, only c. jejuni  <dig> increased in pathogenicity during passage. also, anti-c. jejuni  <dig> specific iga responses of the mice challenged with non-colonizing strains  <dig> and d <dig> were high and low, respectively, suggesting that these responses did not correlate with clearance of the organism from the gi tract. although mucosal iga responses were not measured, these may better correlate with clearance of a particular c. jejuni strain from the gi tract.

percentage of fat in and/or fatty acid composition of diet influenced disease expression during infection with unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig> 
the two diets fed to the mice in these studies differed principally in fat composition  and linoleic acid content , although a number of other constituents were also different. both diets contained wheat, corn, and soybean meal. the ~12% fat diet also contained porcine fat, whey, casein, lecithin, and soybean meal and hulls, whereas the ~6% fat diet contained oats, wheat middlings, fish meal, soybean oil, alfalfa meal, and corn gluten meal. results from a previous unrelated experiment did not show any significant differences in survival, gross pathology, or histopathology between groups of c. jejuni  <dig> infected c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice kept on the ~12% fat diet and mice kept on the ~6% fat diet throughout the experiment . however, since mice in that previous experiment were shifted from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet at least two weeks prior to inoculation, the dietary conditions were not exactly comparable to those experienced by mice undergoing the dietary transition just prior to inoculation. therefore we compared mice infected with non-adapted c. jejuni  <dig> on the ~12% fat diet and mice experiencing the transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet in conjunction with the final phase of the serial passage experiment.

in the diet comparison conducted in the final phase of experiment  <dig> , six of ten mice infected with non-adapted c. jejuni  <dig> that experienced the transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet required early euthanasia due to disease but no mice infected with non-adapted c. jejuni  <dig> and kept on the ~12% fat diet throughout the experiment did so . kaplan meier log rank survival analysis showed that the difference in survival was statistically significant . post hoc comparisons were significant for comparisons of  infected mice on the two diets and  control mice experiencing the transition from the 12% fat diet to the 6% fat diet to infected mice experiencing the transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet at the time of inoculation . in addition, in the diet comparison conducted in the final phase of experiment  <dig> , there were significant differences in gross pathology . however, while mice infected with non-adapted c. jejuni  <dig> that experienced the transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet were significantly different in gross pathology from controls experiencing the dietary transition , the post hoc comparisons of  infected mice on the ~12% fat diet to control mice and  infected mice on the two diets were not significant . finally, there were also significant differences in histopathology  in the diet comparison conducted in the final phase of experiment  <dig> . in post hoc comparisons, infected mice experiencing the transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet at the time of inoculation experienced significantly greater histopathology  than control mice experiencing the dietary transition. however, post hoc comparisons of infected mice on the ~12% fat diet to  infected mice experiencing the dietary transition and  control mice experiencing the dietary transition were not significant .

since different outcomes were observed in two experiments, we conducted another experiment  with a balanced design that allowed a full comparison of mice infected with non-adapted c. jejuni  <dig> on three diet regimes  and control mice on each of the three diet regimes. three infected mice kept on the ~6% fat diet throughout required early euthanasia, as did four mice that experienced the transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet . no mice kept on the ~12% fat diet throughout required early euthanasia. when the survival curves of the three groups of infected mice were compared, the kaplan meier statistic was not significant .

in experiment  <dig> , levels of gross pathology in infected mice were similar in all groups of mice ; no control mice exhibited gross pathology. when gross pathology scores of the six groups of mice were analyzed using two-way anova on ranked data, differences among the groups due to infection status were significant , but there was no statistically significant difference due to diet , nor was there a statistically significant interaction between infection status and diet .

histopathology scores were elevated both in infected mice kept on the ~6% fat diet throughout and in infected mice experiencing the transition from the ~12% fat diet to the ~6% fat diet . when histopathology scores of the six groups of mice were analyzed using two-way anova on ranked data, differences among the groups due to infection status were significant , but there was no statistically significant difference due to diet . nor was there a statistically significant interaction between infection status and diet .

humoral immune responses to c. jejuni infection of mice on the different dietary regimes in experiment  <dig>  are shown in figure  <dig>  when two-way anova was conducted on these data, the effect of infection status  was significant for plasma levels of anti-c. jejuni igg2b, igg2c, igg <dig>  and iga  but not for igg <dig> . there was no statistically significant effect of diet on levels of anti-c. jejuni igg2b, igg2c, igg <dig>  or igg <dig> . there was no statistically significant interaction between diet and infection status for anti-c. jejuni igg2b, igg2c, igg <dig>  or igg <dig> . however, for plasma anti-c. jejuni iga, there was a statistically significant effect of diet  as well as a significant interaction between diet and infection status . plasma iga levels were significantly different in mice on the ~6% fat diet compared to mice on the ~12% fat diet  and in mice on the ~6% fat diet compared to mice experiencing the transition between the two diets at the time of inoculation . plasma iga levels in mice experiencing the dietary transition were not significantly different from those of mice on ~12% fat diet .

discussion
outcome of infection was influenced by genetic differences between c. jejuni strains
mlst analysis of over  <dig> strains has provided a comprehensive picture of genetic relationships among c. jejuni strains . the seven strains used in this study represent six different mlst sequence types with varying degrees of genetic relatedness among them. genetic relationships of the seven strains derived from pathogenicity gene rflp analysis were roughly consistent with those derived from mlst data. however, only a small number of strains were examined, and this congruence may not be substantiated when more strains are examined. disease outcomes were consistent with genetic relationships in that the two strains that failed to colonize c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice clustered at a distance from the colonizing strains in both mlst and pathogenicity gene rflp analyses. however, strains  <dig> and d <dig> were identical in the rflp analysis of virulence loci, and while strain d <dig> was able to colonize the mice at high levels and cause some disease, it did not increase in pathogenicity in the course of four serial passages.  these results support the hypothesis that there are genetic differences between c. jejuni strains that can influence the ability of a given strain to interact with the host. furthermore, the observation that there are differences between c. jejuni strains in the ability to produce enteritis in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice shows that the development of severe disease cannot be solely attributed to the immune alterations of the mice.

all strains used in these experiments possessed twelve known and putative virulence loci for which presence/absence polymorphisms have been reported in the literature. two putative c. jejuni virulence determinants, iam and wlan, which were absent in one or more of the strains used in this study, are probably not required for pathogenicity in mice. the iam marker was first identified as a dna fragment obtained in a random amplified fragment polymorphism analysis; this fragment was epidemiologically linked to c. jejuni associated disease  <cit> . however, another epidemiological study did not reveal a high prevalence of this marker in c. jejuni strains from diseased patients  <cit> , and it has recently been shown that the iam gene makes little or no contribution to invasion of cultured int <dig> cells by c. jejuni strains possessing it  <cit> . our results are in accordance with these findings in that strains d <dig> and d <dig>  which were able to cause enteritis in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice, were iam-. both the cgtb and the wlan genes encode β- <dig> - galactosyltransferases thought to be involved in synthesis of the c. jejuni outer membrane lipo-oligosaccharide. all strains in this study possessed cgtb, and all except d <dig> possessed wlan. muller et al.  <cit>  studied the associations of these genes with the ability to invade caco- <dig> cells in culture and to colonize chickens; their results suggest that possession of one or both genes is associated with the ability to invade eukaryotic cells and to colonize the chicken gi tract, but one strain that lacked both loci was fully invasive.

adaptation to the host by serial passage altered the outcome of infection for three of five c. jejuni strains
three of five c. jejuni strains  became more virulent during serial passage in mice as shown by increased colonization of the jejunum, decreased time to develop clinical disease, and increased levels of both gross pathology  and histopathology. fecal population sizes of two of the three strains that became more virulent increased during serial passage. the change toward increased pathogenicity in the three evolving strains occurred after one passage in two strains and after three passages in one strain. this observation suggests that the strain that increased in pathogenicity only after three passages may have had to undergo more extensive genetic change than the other two strains. an increase in pathogenicity is consistent both with a large body of theoretical work and with previous experimental studies of pathogenicity evolution; in this case, since the mice were individually housed, virulence trade-offs with transmission dynamics between hosts would not be expected to occur. since all mice in all passages of the serial passage experiment experienced the same dietary conditions , differences in the behavior of a c. jejuni strain in different passages cannot be attributed to differences in diet, particularly for strain d <dig>  which did not show increased colonization of the jejunum or marked increases in pathology until after the third passage.

two c. jejuni strains, d <dig> and nw, did not increase in pathogenicity during four serial passages. although we cannot rule out the possibility that continued passage might have produced an increase in pathogenicity in these strains, this result shows that the initial genetic complements of the two strains affected their ability to respond to the selection pressure imposed by the novel host environment of the mouse gi tract.

microarray comparison of the gene content of strain nw to that of strain  <dig> revealed that strain nw did not possess a detectable homologue of c. jejuni gmha, a gene involved in los/lps synthesis encoding sedoheptulose-7-phosphate isomerase. this enzyme is essential for production of the heptose residues of the inner core of the los/lps structure. in haemophilus ducreyi, inactivation of the gmha gene has been shown to result in a truncated los and to reduce the ability of the organism to produce skin lesions in rabbits  <cit> . in addition, the ability of salmonella enterica to kill caenorhabditis elegans was impaired by insertional inactivation of the gmha gene  <cit> . mutation of another c. jejuni gene involved in synthesis of the los inner core, waac, markedly impaired the ability of c. jejuni 81– <dig> to invade the intestinal cell line int <dig> in vitro  <cit> . strain nw was also missing a number of c. jejuni  <dig> genes in complex loci involved in capsule synthesis and o-linked glycosylation of the flagellin protein. extensive variation in these loci has been reported in other microarray comparisons of c. jejuni strains  <cit> . both flagella and capsule have been reported to affect virulence in c. jejuni  <cit> . the reason for the inability of strain d <dig> to increase in virulence is not known, but a similar approach could be taken to examine gene content in comparison to strain  <dig> 

the degree and complexity of the phenotypic changes we observed – increased fecal population sizes, increased colonization of the jejunum, decreased time to develop severe disease, shift from watery to bloody diarrhea – suggest that the three evolving strains underwent genetic change at multiple loci, including loci that influence growth and loci that influence interaction with and damage to host tissues. we have no information on any specific genetic changes that led to these phenotypic changes at the present time; further studies on these strains will utilize gene expression microarrays to focus on the hypothesis that the changes in pathogenicity are due to changes in gene expression levels or patterns; experimental infection of c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice with c. jejuni  <dig> derivatives containing targeted gene knockouts will be used to determine whether corresponding genes contribute to virulence in c. jejuni  <dig> 

outcome of c. jejuni infection and host immune response were influenced by diet
results from two of three trials  of the effect of diet on the outcome of c. jejuni infection) did not indicate that there was an effect of diet on survival, gross pathology, or histopathology in mice infected with unpassaged c. jejuni  <dig>  on the other hand, results from the diet comparison conducted in the final phase of experiment  <dig>  did indicate such an effect. in addition, there was a significant effect of diet on plasma iga levels in the full, balanced design experiment . the latter result indicates that some constituent of the diet, possibly the amount and/or isomeric composition of linoleic acid, could have affected the immune responses of the mice. linoleic acid, which is known to affect the immune response, was present at ~ <dig> % in the 12% fat diet and ~ <dig> % in the 6% fat diet.

the latter results – taken together with the considerable body of literature implicating specific isomeric forms of various dietary lipids, including linoleic acid, as immune system modulators  <cit>  at levels comparable to those in the mouse diets we used  <cit>  and with findings that different dietary lipids can affect the process of infection with listeria monocytogenes  <cit>  – suggest that dietary factors, possibly lipid composition, may affect the outcome of c. jejuni infection in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice. the manufacturer of the mouse chow we used does not report the isomeric composition of the total linoleic acid, which is derived from fish meal, soybean, and grains, and which might be expected to vary from batch to batch. it would therefore be difficult or impossible to determine retrospectively whether the chow fed to the mice in the three experiments was different in composition. finally, it is also possible that the differing constituents of the two diets influenced either the host immune system or the indigenous intestinal microbiota or both in such a way as to affect the pattern or level of disease expression due to c. jejuni infection. experiments using mice fed defined diets would be required to explore these effects.

there was no indication from the elisa results that antibody responses were protective in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice against infection with any of the tested strains of c. jejuni used for challenge. the majority of infected mice produced robust th <dig> associated igg2b responses to all c. jejuni strains tested; this response was associated with disease except in strains d <dig> and nw. infected non-colonized mice did not produce strong igg2b responses. also, other antibody responses in plasma of all infected mice were low. however, there were some significant differences between the first and last passage in levels of anti-c. jejuni  <dig> igg2b antibodies detected by elisa in mice challenged with various c. jejuni strains. we suspect that these differences reflected changing surface antigenic structures of the c. jejuni strains during repeated passage that made them more or less similar to antigen from the unadapted  <dig> strain used to coat the elisa plates. thus, strain  <dig> changed over passage so that mice in the last passage had significantly less anti-non-adapted  <dig> igg2b antibodies than mice in the first passage. this speculation would have to be followed up with further experiments to test this hypothesis. in contrast, mice challenged with strain d <dig> in the fourth passage produced igg2b antibodies that recognized non-adapted strain  <dig> elisa antigens better than mice in the first passage experiment. in addition, there was no correlation between any immunoglobulin isotype and colonization  of any c. jejuni strain at day  <dig> after infection. this result is in contrast to those of fox et al. where c57bl <dig> mice infected with c. jejuni 81– <dig> cleared their infections  <dig> days after challenge and clearance was correlated with lower th <dig> associated igg2a responses  <cit> . furthermore, in our dataset it was interesting that in the first round of c. jejuni challenges the highest  th <dig> associated igg <dig> responses were seen in mice receiving the colonizing strains that caused little or no disease or lesions. a similar pattern was observed in iga responses. in mice in groups receiving the nonpathogenic c. jejuni strains nw and d <dig>  continued adaptation of the strain elicited significantly less iga and, in the case of d <dig>  less igg <dig>  taken together these results suggest that there is variability in ability of c. jejuni strains to elicit th <dig> associated immunoglobulins and that this variability is affected by adaptation to the host, although the impact of this change on colonization and disease status is not clear. further work is needed to examine anti-c. jejuni strain specific iga levels in the gastrointestinal tract where iga exerts its main effect.

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported here show that c. jejuni strains from humans, chickens, and cattle vary in their ability to colonize and cause enteritis in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice. furthermore, serial passage of c. jejuni strains in c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mice as well as dietary factors increase disease expression in this mouse model. thus, the c57bl/ <dig> il-10-/- mouse model can be used to detect differences in pathogenicity of different c. jejuni strains and is suitable for screening clinical isolates from different human disease states or for screening c. jejuni strains carrying disrupted putative virulence genes. the orfs identified here as present in c. jejuni strain  <dig> and absent in strain nw will be disrupted and screened for their role in pathogenicity. furthermore, the model offers the opportunity to dissect the complex interactions between host genetics, host immune responses, pathogen genetics, and environmental factors such as diet and the indigenous microbiota that ultimately determine the course and outcome of infection. such studies would clearly enhance investigations of c. jejuni virulence mechanisms and perhaps lead to improved options for prevention and treatment of this common disease.
