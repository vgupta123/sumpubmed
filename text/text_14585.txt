BACKGROUND
small noncoding rnas  were first identified and described in the 1960s, but remained largely ignored until recently when they were recognized as important post-transcriptional regulators in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms  <cit> . these srnas have been found in a number of pathogenic bacteria belonging to family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . for example, helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of chronic active, chronic persistent, and atrophic gastritis in adults and children, and implicated in a majority of duodenal and gastric ulcers, carries a repertoire of at least one anti-sense transcriptional start site on approximately 46 % of its open-reading frames, 28 % of trnas, and the 5′ leader sequences for both 16s rrna and 23s rrna  <cit> . barring a few exceptions, srnas are typically  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length and do not code for proteins . regulatory functions can predominantly be attributed to their interactions with proteins or target mrna transcripts  <cit> . the srnas in the latter category manipulate rna transcription through either cis-acting or trans-acting mechanisms  <cit> . by definition, cis-acting srnas are encoded on the anti-sense strand and generally display perfect nucleotide complementarity with the target sequence in the open reading frame. trans-acting srnas, on the other hand, are encoded within the intergenic regions, act on the targets elsewhere in the genome, and possess short segments of partial nucleotide complementarity to their target genes . accordingly, they require a known rna chaperone, namely hfq, encoded by nearly 50 % of all bacterial species to facilitate their binding interactions with an mrna transcript  <cit> . in other organisms such as listeria monocytogenes, however, most trans-acting small rnas function independent of the chaperone activity of hfq  <cit> .

the genus rickettsia includes obligate, intracellular gram-negative bacteria belonging to the class alphaproteobacteria. based on the transmitting natural vector, disease presentation, and antigenicity, this genus was traditionally divided into spotted fever and typhus as two major groups, but sophisticated molecular phylogenetic analysis now classifies rickettsiae into four groups, namely ancestral , typhus , transitional , and spotted fever   <cit> . upon transmission into humans from the arthropod vector, vascular endothelial cells are the primary targets of rickettsial infections, with the notable exception of r. akari, which primarily invades macrophages  <cit> . among well-known human rickettsioses, rocky mountain spotted fever  due to r. rickettsii and epidemic typhus caused by r. prowazekii are considered to be the most severe forms of disease. without proper antibiotic treatment, mortality rate for rmsf is approximately 20 %  <cit> , while the same for epidemic typhus reportedly ranges from 10 % to 60 %  <cit> . also, r. prowazekii is unique in that patients can harbor sub-clinical infections after successful treatment of the primary infection and later develop recrudescent typhus, also known as brill-zinsser disease, despite being symptom-free for years  <cit> . on the other hand, mediterranean spotted fever and endemic typhus, caused respectively by r. conorii and r. typhi, generally represent relatively milder forms of spotted fever and typhus  <cit> .

due to the historic importance of rickettsial diseases, their global distribution and associated morbidity or mortality, and potential implications in bioterrorism, the genome of r. prowazekii was the first to be sequenced and published  <cit> . unlike other intracellular bacteria, whose genomes have very high coding densities, r. prowazekii was found to have 24 % non-coding dna  <cit> . such large amount of non-coding dna was projected to be the consequence of genomic reduction and pseudogenization due to the loss or degradation of genes involved in several mechanisms leading to obligate intracellular lifestyle of this pathogen. a number of other rickettsial genomes, including those of r. rickettsii, r. conorii, r. typhi, and other notable species have since been sequenced and either published or made available in biomedical databases . however, the presence of small, non-coding rnas in different rickettsia species still remains undetermined. with an aim to address this important knowledge gap, we used sipht/srnapredict <dig> to identify candidate novel srnas within the intergenic regions of all four rickettsial groups, leading to the prediction of a total of  <dig>  novel srnas within  <dig> different strains representing  <dig> rickettsial species. we further analyzed the predicted srnas in r. prowazekii strain brienl using other bioinformatic tools and experimentally validated their expression using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  and deep sequencing approaches. in tandem, these analyses constitute the very first evidence documenting the presence of srnas in rickettsial genomes.

RESULTS
bioinformatic prediction of small rnas
ready availability of complete genome sequences render computational approaches a widely acceptable first step for identification of srnas . such bioinformatic approaches search the intergenic regions  of a bacterial genome for specific srna features. in general, the strategy involves an in-depth search of igrs for the presence of rho-independent terminators, promoters, and transcription factor binding sites, followed by the analysis of their secondary structure and comparison of such igrs with closely related species  <cit> . in this study, we employed the web-based program sipht to examine the genomes of  <dig> rickettsial strains, which represent a total of  <dig> species spanning all four rickettsial groups. four known plasmids, representing three from the spotted fever group strains and one from a transitional group strain, were also included. the r. felis prfdelta plasmid  was excluded from the analysis as it was found to be an artifact from genome assembly  <cit> . we primarily employed recommended default settings to identify most srna features. to perform a more stringent search, however, we chose to decrease the expectation value  from the default 5e− <dig> to 1e− <dig> to minimize false positives. as a result, we identified a total of  <dig>  candidate rickettsial srnas . on average, we predicted  <dig> candidates per ancestral strain,  <dig> candidates per typhus strain,  <dig> candidates per transitional strain, and  <dig> candidates per spotted fever strain. table  <dig> categorizes the number of predictions by nucleotide size and rickettsial strain. of the four plasmids examined, r. peacockii plasmid rpr had a single srna prediction.table  <dig> srna predictions categorized by nucleotide size

computational analysis of srna predictions
based on the predictive analysis suggesting srnas in all rickettsial groups, we set out to analyze each of the candidate srnas. in order to examine a common set of bacterial srnas within rickettsia species, we first investigated five well-known bacterial srnas, namely 6s rna , α-tmrna , rnasep_bact_a, rpsl_ricks, and  <dig> s rna , and confirmed their presence in r. prowazekii. using blast with an e-value cut-off of 1e− <dig>  we compared the prediction for each strain against others included in the study to find shared srna candidates  <cit> . as expected, we noted that rickettsial strains closely related to each other phylogenetically had a greater number of shared srna candidates when compared to those that are distantly related . for example, r. rickettsii strain sheila smith  and strain iowa , which share  <dig>  % homology  <cit> , had  <dig> srnas in addition to ten other srna predictions in iowa, and  <dig> present only in sheila smith.table  <dig> srna comparison

we next employed the web-based program, bprom, to determine promoter motifs for predicted srnas in the spotted fever and typhus group of rickettsiae, since they represent the most prominent groups of human pathogens. while it is still undetermined whether the ancestral group causes human disease, the transitional group species are established pathogens, but they account for a small fraction of reported rickettsiosis cases. using all srna predictions within the typhus group  and the spotted fever group , we searched  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the predicted srna start site for the - <dig> and - <dig> promoter motifs because nearly 80 % of known σ <dig> promoters in e. coli, considered to be a model organism, fall within  <dig> bp of the transcription start site  <cit> . while bprom successfully predicted the - <dig> and - <dig> promoter sites for all candidate typhus group srnas, it was unable to predict a promoter site for one srna candidate  belonging to r. rickettsii strain sheila smith.

using the data obtained from the bprom software, we calculated the average distance for the predicted - <dig> motif and - <dig> motif for both spotted fever and typhus groups of rickettsiae. for the typhus group, - <dig> and - <dig> motifs were an average of  <dig> and  <dig>  nucleotides upstream of the srna start site, respectively. the spotted fever group had similar nucleotide distances at  <dig> and  <dig>  nucleotides upstream. the average distance between the - <dig> and - <dig> motifs was  <dig> nucleotides for both groups, slightly longer than the reported 17 ±  <dig> nucleotide distance optimal for escherichia coli genes  <cit> . typhus group and spotted fever nucleotide frequencies for the - <dig> and - <dig> motifs were plotted using weblogo <dig> . the known consensus sequences of e. coli open reading frames  for the - <dig> motif and - <dig> motif are tataat  and ttgaca , respectively  <cit> . both rickettsial groups favored a - <dig> motif similar to the consensus sequence. interestingly, the − <dig> motif differed between the groups, as well as from the e. coli consensus sequence, at the fifth nucleotide. in e. coli, this position is cytosine in 54 % of tested sequences. however, it is adenosine  or thymine  in spotted fever and thymine  or adenosine  in typhus. in addition, the second nucleotide position in typhus is most conserved with a thymine in nearly 100 % of predicted sites, while it is approximately 90 % for spotted fever. this is in contrast to e. coli, which has a thymine with 79 % probability at the same nucleotide position.fig.  <dig> srna promoter frequencies. conservation diagrams illustrating the probability of a nucleotide in a specific promoter motif position. the left side demonstrates the − <dig> promoter motif, while the right side is the − <dig> promoter motif. the upper portion displays the typhus group, while the lower displays the spotted fever group. both groups have − <dig> motifs similar to the e. coli consensus sequence . on the other hand, the − <dig> motifs vary when compared to the e. coli consensus sequence 



in an attempt to explain the differences in srna predictions between sheila smith and iowa strains of r. rickettsii, we performed a comparative analysis by mapping the srnas present only in one of the strain but absent in another. accordingly, we compared  <dig> predictions from sheila smith strain and their corresponding 150bp up- and downstream sequences to the strain iowa genome. all “prediction ±  <dig> bp” sequences were >99 % identical with the exception of two  srnas. for instance, srna candidate # <dig> had a  <dig> bp sequence absent from the predicted srna sequence in the iowa genome . the same analysis was conducted for the  <dig> predictions present only in r. rickettsii strain iowa but absent in strain sheila smith. again, all but two “prediction ±  <dig> bp” sequences were nearly identical . in this case, prediction # <dig> for strain iowa had a  <dig> bp sequence that was absent in strain sheila smith . also, an orf was annotated in corresponding genomic regions in strain sheila smith for nearly 30 % of srnas predicted only in strain iowa, while two srnas had snps and indels in the sheila smith sequences potentially leading to altered thermostability of secondary structures. similar observations were made for srnas present only on sheila smith but absent in iowa strain. since sipht relies on the conserved intergenic regions, secondary structures, presence of promoters, and terminator sequences, it is likely that the srnas predicted only in one strain, but not the other, result from these stringent criteria.fig.  <dig> alignment of r. rickettsii strain sheila smith srna candidate # <dig>  the srna candidate # <dig>  predicted only in r. rickettsii strain sheila smith but not in strain iowa and the upstream  <dig> bp region of predicted srna were aligned with the corresponding genomic region from strain iowa. the predicted − <dig> box , − <dig> box , and srna sequence  are highlighted. a 20bp deletion observed in the genomic sequence of strain iowa is shown by the dotted line

candidate srna target identification
although spotted fever rickettsiae cause disease worldwide, we chose to initially focus on r. prowazekii due to the high public health threat. in addition, due to bioweapon testing during world war ii and the development of antibiotic resistant strains during the cold war, r. prowazekii remains on the list of select agents with potential for bioterrorism  <cit> . to identify potential mrna targets for predicted srnas within the r. prowazekii genome, we chose two independent web-based programs, targetrna <dig> and coprarna, to predict srna:mrna interactions by assessing the base pairing potential based on a smith-waterman dynamic and conservation profile, respectively . the search parameters were set to default and a p-value threshold of ≤ <dig> . a total of  <dig> potential targets were identified by targetrna <dig>  whereas coprarna predicted  <dig> protein coding genes to be regulated by srnas. a detailed comparative analysis revealed that  <dig> srna candidates had common target genes predicted by both programs and the remaining  <dig> candidates had independent predictions . two srna candidates  had the highest number of  <dig> common targets predicted by targetrna <dig> and coprarna, in contrast to only one commonly predicted target for candidates # <dig> and # <dig>  in summary, a total of  <dig> target genes were predicted by both programs, of which only  <dig> were categorized as hypothetical proteins. of note, target genes such as virb <dig>  ftsl, ftsq, seca, ruvb, and 190kda antigen were commonly predicted, indicating the potential role of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in type iv secretion, cell division, and dna repair. table  <dig> lists the number of predicted target transcripts for each predicted srna. interestingly, targetrna <dig> failed to predict targets for candidate # <dig>  but coprarna predicted  <dig> target genes . nevertheless, if the lack of target prediction by targetrna <dig> holds true for candidate # <dig>  this may be due to a srna:protein interaction, as is the case with 6s rna, or it may simply represent a degraded orf with an active promoter and terminator. using this information, we parsed the predicted mrna targets based on their respective protein function. we selected eight categories, including a category for ‘other’  and ‘hypothetical proteins’ , and separated the  <dig> predictions into different categories. the categories included cell division, cell wall, metabolism, ribosomal functions, virulence, type iv secretion system, transport proteins, and phagosomal escape . our targetrna <dig> and coprarna results demonstrate that the majority of known targets for srnas are involved in metabolism , ribosomal functions , and cell division . however, both the programs predicted a large number of target genes potentially regulated by srnas that were categorized as ‘other’  and ‘hypothetical proteins’ , respectively . while targetrna <dig> uses smith-waterman dynamic based base pairing, coprarna predictions are largely based on conservation between different genomes, possibly resulting in the differences in the number of predicted targets.table  <dig> srna target predictions

target genes are classified into ten categories based on either known or hypothetical function for r. prowazekii strain breinl



rna sequencing
next, we set out to confirm the expression of rickettsial srnas during infection of cultured human microvascular endothelial cells  with r. prowazekii. we infected hmecs with r. prowazekii strain breinl and extracted total rna at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection. our rationale for choosing these durations was to allow ample time for rickettsial entry and establishment of infection within the host cells and sufficient time for at least two replication cycles keeping in mind that replication time for intracellular rickettsiae ranges from  <dig> to 11h. after removal of rrnas and eukaryotic mrna, the enriched bacterial rna was reverse transcribed into cdna libraries and subjected to next generation sequencing using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> system. the resulting rna reads were mapped onto the r. prowazekii strain breinl  genome. our deep sequencing resulted in approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  million total reads for rna isolated at  <dig> h and  <dig>  to  <dig>  million total reads at  <dig> h post-infection. out of these, an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads mapped to the r. prowazekii genome at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively. rickettsia species include obligate intracellular bacteria with fastidious growth requirements in a host cell and cannot yet be cultured in a cell-free environment. recently, it has been reported that intracellular organisms such as rickettsia represent only 5 % of the extracted total rna, while the remaining 95 % belongs to the eukaryotic host. out of approximately 5 % bacterial total rna, 95 % is composed of ribosomal and transfer rna, while the remaining 5 % of the transcripts correspond to bacterial mrna and srna, yielding a ratio of ~1: <dig> bacterial mrna and srna in total rna extracted during the infection  <cit> . although microbe enrichment is aimed at removing most of the polyadenylated eukaryotic transcripts and ribosomal rnas, the process often accomplishes only limited removal of other interfering eukaryotic rnas such trnas, noncoding rnas, and mitochondrial rna. furthermore, high abundance of rrnas in the host cells also interferes with the efficacy of their removal from the sample preparations. supporting our results, a recent study has reported that only 2–5 % of the total reads mapped to the intracellular bacterial genomes despite enrichment of the total rna  <cit> . by analyzing the sequencing data at the genome locations predicted by sipht, we found that twelve out of  <dig> predicted srna had a mean expression value  that was ≥ <dig>  times compared to their respective  <dig> nucleotide upstream and downstream flanking regions . as expected, all five well known srnas, namely 6s rna, α-tmrna, rnasep_bact_a, rpsl_ricks, and  <dig> s rna were found to be expressed in vitro and exhibited an mev of > <dig> . the read coverage plots of 6s rna, rnasep_bact_a and α-tmrna are presented in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> srna predicted promoter locations

this table outlines those r. prowazekii strain breinl srna predictions that had an mev ≥ <dig> . it includes the sipht predicted start and stop positions as well as the predicted strand. in addition, it contains the bprom predicted − <dig> box and − <dig> box for the σ <dig> promoters



validation of srna predictions via rt-pcr
prior to validating our predicted srnas, we decided to investigate the expression of 6s rna within r. prowazekii. the underlying rationale for choosing 6s rna to begin with was its particularly high abundance in e. coli, which can reach ~ <dig>  copies during late stationary phase  <cit> . using 16s rrna as the endogenous control and infection for  <dig>  h as baseline, we demonstrated a significant  increase in its expression from  <dig> to  <dig> h post-infection  using taqman-based real-time rt-pcr . after confirming expression of 6s rna, we chose nine srna candidates  to verify their expression in r. prowazekii str. brienl during infection of hmecs. these were chosen based on their location within the genome, orientation comparative to the neighboring genes, and potential mrna targets . candidates # <dig> and # <dig> were not detected using rt-pcr. however, the remaining seven candidates were detected using rt-pcr  with an amplicon near the expected size.fig.  <dig> 6s rna  expression during host cell infection. r. prowazekii strain brienl 6s rna  expression was measured during the infection of hmecs over a course of  <dig> h . the expression was normalized to 16s rrna  and baselined to  <dig> h post infection. significant increase was observed starting at 6h post infection. data is represented as mean ± sem. **p

discussion
in this study, we report on a genome wide computational analysis to identify novel srnas within the genus rickettsia. we have identified  <dig>  srnas in  <dig> rickettsial strains belonging to  <dig> different species and spanning across all rickettsial groups. to further confirm our srna predictions, we have validated the expression of six predicted trans-acting srnas in r. prowazekii strain breinl using high throughput sequencing and rt-pcr approaches. since the initial discovery of srnas in 1960s, e. coli has been shown to harbor nearly  <dig> to  <dig> small rnas, while salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium genome encodes for ~ <dig> small rnas  <cit> . abundant evidence now demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of srnas in bacterial genomes and implicates them to play an important role in virulence, quorum sensing, survival, plasmid expression, and primary and secondary metabolism in addition to several other housekeeping functions . in vibrio cholerae and v. harveyi, quorum-sensing genes hapr and luxr are under the regulatory control of four and five srnas, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, the deletion of three srnas in listeria monocytogenes results in an attenuated phenotype in mouse models and the mutant strain is unable to grow in murine macrophages  <cit> . similarly, rli <dig> knockout mutants of listeria were found to be attenuated in orally infected mice, suggesting a role in the pathogen’s virulence  <cit> , and the deletion of lhra in l. monocytogenes was capable of altering the expression of over  <dig> genes  <cit> . in salmonella enterica, the amgr small rna controls the expression of the mgtcbr mrna required for survival in macrophages and its over expression leads to decreased virulence in mouse models  <cit> . however, studies examining the potential regulatory roles of srnas in obligate intracellular bacteria remain rather limited. in addition to an srna that regulates hcta,  <dig> trans-acting and  <dig> cis-acting srnas have been identified in chlamydia trachomatis, an intracellular human pathogen  <cit> . more recently, coxiella burnetii and buchnera aphidicola genomes are shown to encode for  <dig> and  <dig> srnas, respectively, and coxiella srnas exhibit differential expression at different growth stages . here, we report on the existence of novel small rnas in rickettsial genomes and their potential roles as determinants of pathogen virulence, host adaptation, and metabolism.

several prediction programs using parameters such as comparative genomics, rna structure, and thermodynamic stability, have been developed and utilized to identify bacterial small rnas . in this study, we have chosen sipht to predict trans-acting srnas in rickettsial genomes as this prediction tool uses several other well established and widely used programs to identify potential transcription factor binding sites ; rho-independent terminators using rnamotif  <cit> , transtermhp  <cit> , and findterm  <cit> ; conserved secondary structures by qrna  <cit> ; and conserved nucleotide sequences by blastn  <dig>   <cit> . further, this program has been widely applied for srna predictions in several other bacteria attesting to its potential for accurately predicting bacterial srnas and its web-based availability makes it both user-friendly and easily accessible. additionally, unlike its counterparts such as eqrna and rnaz, sipht specifically searches for rho-independent terminators and conserved intergenic structures significantly eliminating the chances of false-positive predictions  <cit> . using sipht, we have predicted an average of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> srnas in typhus, ancestral, transitional, and spotted fever groups of rickettsia species, respectively. to test if predicted srnas have upstream transcription factor binding sites and downstream rho-independent terminator , we have further analyzed all r. prowazekii srnas using bprom  <cit>  and transtermhp  <cit> . all r. prowazekii srnas have a predicted upstream σ <dig> promoter and a rho-independent termination confirming the results retrieved from sipht .

our genus-wide global analysis suggests that the repertoire of predicted srnas is independent of the size of respective rickettsial genomes. this is exemplified by the presence of  <dig> srnas in  <dig> mbp genome of r. peacocki , in contrast to only  <dig> srnas in  <dig> mbp genome of ancestral r. bellii. the number of srnas among rickettsiae in different groups, however, tends to directly correlate with their respective genome size, while the average number of srnas per mbp of the genome within a particular group varies depending on the rickettsia species/strain. for example, r. bellii and r. canadensis, belonging to the ancestral group and carrying the genomes of  <dig> mbp and  <dig> mbp, respectively, encode for  <dig> and  <dig> srnas. on the other hand, r. canadensis has only  <dig> srnas/mbp, while r. bellii has 65 srnas/mbp, indicating the impact of genomic content and organization on the prediction of srnas. also, although the average length of srnas in r. bellii and r. canadensis are fairly similar , a detailed analysis of the length of intergenic regions  in r. bellii and r. canadensis revealed that r. bellii has ~63 % more igrs ranging from 1– <dig> bp. it is, therefore, possible that the lower number of srnas in r. canadensis is due to the differences in the number of igrs included in the sipht analysis. another notable difference is evident between r. akari and r. felis in the transitional group. while both had over  <dig> predictions, the coding density of srnas in r. akari  was 22 % lower in comparison to r. felis . rickettsia are generally presumed to exhibit limited horizontal gene transfer  due to their obligate intracellular life-style. however, recent reports document the dynamic nature of their genomes and transposable elements, palindromic repeats, and horizontally acquired genes have been identified in several rickettsia species  <cit> . for example, the transposable elements in r. felis cause inactivation of genes or integration of foreign dna resulting in changes to both genomic content and arrangement  <cit> . in this regard, at least  <dig> genes in r. felis have been suggested to be acquired through horizontal gene transfer from other proteobacteria or amoebae  <cit> . additionally, r. prowazekii and r. typhi, despite having similar size genomes, encode for  <dig> and  <dig> srnas, respectively. again, the number of igrs included in the sipht analysis varies between r. prowazekii strain brienl and r. typhi strain wilmington , which may explain the differences in the total number of predicted srnas in these typhus rickettsiae genomes.

although computational approaches yield convincing evidence for the existence of srnas in rickettsia, it is critical to validate the expression of predicted srnas during host-pathogen interactions via experimental strategies. in this context, we first attempted to confirm the expression of 6s rna , a well-characterized small, noncoding rna ubiquitously present in most bacterial lineages, including gammaproteobacteria and bacillales  <cit> . although most bacteria encode a single copy of the ssrs gene, some bacterial species including bacillus subtilis reportedly encode for two copies that are differentially expressed depending on the stage of growth  <cit> . 6s rna is most abundantly expressed during late stationary phase, where it interacts with rna polymerase and regulates σ <dig> function. these data further support possible roles of 6s rna in long-term survival and nutrient uptake  <cit> . also, 6s rna is potentially involved in intracellular stress response in c. burnetii and legionella pneumophila  <cit> . we report a significant increase in the 6s rna expression from  <dig> to  <dig> h post-infection when compared to the basal expression level at  <dig>  h. also, based on our mev calculations, we observed an increase of 2- and 5-fold in the expression of 6s rna at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection, respectively. this is in agreement with earlier findings from other pathogenic bacteria. specifically, a 2-fold up-regulation in its expression at  <dig> h appears to correspond to a similar increase seen in c. burnetii  <cit> . our data further suggest that the highest expression at  <dig> h post-infection coincides with the intracellular growth kinetics of rickettsiae  <cit> . a comprehensive analysis to elucidate its mechanisms of action and regulatory functions in intracellular rickettsiae is warranted and currently in progress.

because rna sequencing is a novel and robust methodology, which provides valuable insights into the global transcriptome  <cit> , we subjected total rna from r. prowazekii-infected endothelial cells to validate the presence of srnas and their expression during host-pathogen interactions. since the major focus of this study was the identification and validation of intergenic trans-acting srnas, additional information on the cis-acting expressed by r. prowazekii strain breinl during infection of hmecs was excluded to perform a direct comparative and confirmatory analysis of sipht based srna predictions versus their expression in vitro. furthermore, none of the web based srna prediction tools have the ability to identify cis-acting srnas in the genomes. mev based identification of srnas in bacterial genomes is a widely utilized approach that exploits the expression profile of srnas and their respective flanking regions to determine the biogenesis of srnas  <cit> . to this end, the reads mapping to each nucleotide of the srnas and their respective  <dig> bp flanking regions were normalized using the total number of reads mapping to the rickettsial genome  and then to their length, and mevs were determined to decipher the expression of srnas from potential read-throughs attributed to flanking orfs due to leaky transcriptional termination in r. prowazekii  <cit> . nearly 50 % of predicted srnas in r. prowazekii exhibited an mev of ≥ <dig>  when compared to respective flanking regions indicating their biogenesis and expression independent of neighboring genes. the reads’ coverage plots for 6s rna, rnasep_bact_a, and α-tmrna clearly demonstrate the independent expression of these srnas .

during invasion of epithelial cells and intracellular replication within macrophages, salmonella expresses isrm rna encoded in salmonella pathogenicity islands  <cit> . l. monocytogenes encodes a thermosensor srna, which upon encountering human body temperature  forms an alternative secondary structure and activates adhesins, phagosome escape mechanisms, and other immune-regulating factors  <cit> . further assessment of the expression profile of five srnas  showing an mev of ≥ <dig>  revealed their steady-state expression of these srnas from  <dig>  to  <dig> h post-infection indicating potential roles in pathogenesis. interestingly, despite an mev of < <dig> , candidate # <dig> was expressed between  <dig> to  <dig> h and its expression increased over time, most notably after  <dig> h. since our in-depth transcriptome analysis was performed at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection, we hypothesize that the relative expression of candidate # <dig> is likely inadequate to generate sufficient reads to achieve an mev greater than  <dig>  fold. alternatively, the sequencing depth may not have been high enough to achieve a  <dig> -fold difference. even though 50 % of the predicted srnas were either not detected or expressed below the cut-off mev in our rna-seq analysis, it is plausible that they are bonafide srnas conditionally expressed during other conditions such as stress and host-vector interactions. previous studies have shown that different environments induce specific srnas. small rna ryhb, known to down-regulate genes involved in iron storage in e. coli, is induced mainly during low iron conditions  <cit> . in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, isrj srna is induced under low oxygen and magnesium environments and elevated levels of isre are observed in iron responsive environment  <cit> . similarly, h. pylori is known to induce the expression of six small rnas  associated with acid stress  <cit> . alternatively, it is also plausible that sipht may have identified degraded orfs  <cit> . rickettsial genomes are known to evolve by reductive evolution  and transposons are known to play a pivotal role in gene inactivation  <cit> . r. prowazekii is known to have pseudogenes potentially resulting from gene inactivation  <cit> . since sipht uses the presence of an upstream promoter and downstream transcriptional terminator as the main criteria for predicting srnas, it is possible that some of srna transcripts predicted by sipht potentially map to the degrading orfs, which still retain conserved promoter and terminator regions.

despite the abundance of srnas in all bacterial lineages, little is known about their function and mechanism of action within the bacterial genomes and only a few srnas have been assigned with functions till date  <cit> . using targetrna <dig> and coprarna, we have predicted the target mrnas regulated by r. prowazekii srnas. functional categorization of the target genes regulated by srnas resulted in identification of genes involved in key pathways of cell division, transport, phagosomal escape, virulence, type iv secretion system, and metabolism. a majority of these pathways are critical for the growth and survival of rickettsia in the host cytoplasm. for example, we have identified  <dig> genes involved in transport mechanisms and potentially regulated by srnas, a function important for rickettsial survival in vivo as they encode for translocases required for the exchange of adp with atp from host cell cytosol  <cit> . following invasion into host cell, rickettsiae quickly escape escape into the host cytosol by phagosome degradation and published studies have implicated a role of rickettsial hemolysin c  and phospholipase d  in phagosomal escape  <cit> . we have identified two srnas, # <dig> and  <dig>  with the potential to regulate tlyc and pld, respectively, suggesting an important role for these srna in the establishment of infection. a significant number  of predicted target genes were categorized as ‘hypothetical proteins’, which is not surprising considering that nearly 26 % of the  <dig> r. prowazekii genes are still reported as uncharacterized orfs. as rickettsial genes are further investigated for their functional roles, we anticipate that most of these hypothetical proteins will likely be assigned a role in virulence, survival, and pathogenesis during host-pathogen and vector-pathogen interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
bacterial small rnas are now well appreciated as the major post-transcriptional regulators involved in key processes such as virulence, quorum sensing, survival, plasmid expression, and primary and secondary metabolism. rickettsia species, despite undergoing reductive evolution, generally harbor ~25–30 % intergenic regions and presumably encode for trans-acting srnas. this study was aimed at identifying trans-acting srnas in rickettsial genomes and their possible roles in host-pathogen interactions. we have identified  <dig> srnas in  <dig> rickettsial species spanning across all four rickettsial groups, and validated the expression of r. prowazekii srnas by rt-pcr and high throughput transcriptome analysis. furthermore, using taqman assay, we have quantified the expression of r. prowazekii 6s rna, a small rna known to regulate the housekeeping transcription factor σ <dig>  during host cell infection. our study is the first to report on the existence of small rnas in the genus rickettsia. further studies are required to validate candidate trans-acting and identify cis-acting srnas as well as determine their functions in rickettsial physiology and pathogenesis.
