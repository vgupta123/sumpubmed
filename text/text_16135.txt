BACKGROUND
c <dig> photosynthesis is more complex than the ancestral c <dig> pathway of carbon fixation and involves morphological and biochemical modifications leading to a significant reduction in photorespiration. this is achieved by compartmentalization of the processes of carbon dioxide  fixation and reduction between physiologically distinct mesophyll  and bundle sheath  cells. the resulting increase in the photosynthesis rate allows c <dig> plants to achieve high biomass yields under adverse conditions, such as drought, high temperature, and co <dig> or nitrogen limitation. it also favours their use for the production of biofuels  <cit>  and as ‘green’ chemical biofactories  <cit>  to produce replacements for petroleum-derived products.

polyhydroxyalkanoates , linear polyesters produced naturally in bacteria as a means of storing carbon  <cit> , are an ideal molecule to produce in c <dig> plants. when extracted and processed they have similar properties to many common plastics but are fully biodegradable. large-scale production of phas in high biomass yielding crops would provide a sustainable supply of bioplastics and energy from one plant feedstock that could be processed economically in a biorefinery  <cit> . the simplest pha, polyhydroxybutyrate , has been successfully produced in a number of plant species  <cit>  and has potential applications not only as a bioplastic, but also for the production of chemicals and improved animal feeds  <cit> . in plants, phb is produced by the heterologous expression of three bacterial genes encoding a β-ketothiolase , an acetoacetyl-coa reductase  and a phb polymerase   <cit> . the ketothiolase condenses two molecules of acetyl-coa to form acetoacetyl-coa which is reduced to 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa by the acetoacetyl-coa reductase. phb polymerase then incorporates 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa into the growing polymer chain. thus, appropriate targeting of the phb biosynthesis enzymes to subcellular compartments where sufficient acetyl-coa and reducing power are available is necessary.

in c <dig> plants, phb has been successfully produced in the plastids  <cit>  and peroxisomes  <cit> . although phb accumulation in the chloroplasts of the c <dig> crops maize  <cit>  , sugarcane  <cit>   and switchgrass  <cit>   has reached more than 5% of leaf dry weight  in individual leaves, these levels are not yet commercially viable  <cit> . the highest phb levels to date have been reported in chloroplasts of c <dig> plants upon nuclear expression of plastid-targeted enzymes in arabidopsis thaliana <cit>   or direct expression of transgenes from the plastome in tobacco  <cit>  . thus the compartmentalization of c <dig> photosynthesis between two distinct cell types, i.e. m and bs cells appears to affect polymer production in high yielding c <dig> biomass crops. in maize, sugarcane and switchgrass  <cit>  less phb is produced in the chloroplasts of m cells than in bs cells. while the cause of this disparity in product accumulation between cell types is unknown, this presents a significant loss in yield potential for phb in these c <dig> plants. mesophyll cells occupy on average 79% and 66% of the total chlorenchyma area per vein for the c <dig> subtypes nadp-dependent malic enzyme  and nad-dependent malic enzyme , respectively  <cit> . significant increases in phb production are thus theoretically possible if polymer levels in chloroplasts of m cells can be elevated.

the present study explored the distribution of phb production between m and bs cells in both sugarcane and switchgrass. we also measured some key metabolites to determine if further insight could be gained into the low m production of phb. we examined the effect of polymer synthesis on the content of fatty acids, starch and soluble sugars . while de novo fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in both types of photosynthetic cells in c <dig> plants  <cit>  starch is produced preferentially in bs where the benson-calvin cycle is localized  <cit> . the cellular localization of sucrose synthesis varies between c <dig> grasses  <cit> .

RESULTS
plant material
sugarcane lines identified in our previous reports are relabelled as follows with phb values reported earlier  <cit>  as the mean ± standard error: wild-type q <dig> , ta <dig> , 4 f <dig> , 8c <dig>  and 7c <dig> . these phb values reflect data measured in whole-leaf blades from the oldest green leaf. the expression of genes encoding phb pathway enzymes phaa, phab and phac in sugarcane is driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter in lp, the rice ubiquitin promoter in mp <dig>  and the maize cab-m <dig> promoter in mp <dig> and hp. sugarcane plants were grown from cuttings taken from the original transgenic plant material and grown in a physical containment glasshouse under ambient lighting conditions. switchgrass lines identified as wt, lp , mp <dig> , hp  represent independent transformation events expressing the phb biosynthesis genes phaa, phab and phac, under the control of the maize cab-m <dig> promoter  <cit> . these phb values reflect data measured in segments approximately 15 cm from the tip of leaf blades adjacent to the node at the base of the stem. switchgrass plants were grown in a glasshouse at 28°c with supplemental lighting  and maintained by repotting every six months.

distribution of phb enzymes between m and bs chloroplasts
immunolocalization of phaa and phab in transverse leaf sections of sugarcane and switchgrass showed that these two proteins are targeted to the chloroplasts of both m and bs cells . our highest producing sugarcane plants and all of the switchgrass plants contain a hybrid phac  <cit>  for which antiserum was not available and so immunolocalization of phac was not conducted.

activity of phb enzymes in m and bs
enzyme activities were measured in total protein extracted from whole leaf and from m and bs chloroplast fractions. both phaa and phab activity could be detected in the whole leaf extracts from sugarcane  and switchgrass . in all samples analysed, phaa  and phab  activities were either equal or higher in m than bs chloroplasts. detection of phab activity in sugarcane bs protein fractions did not yield consistent results. this could be due to the instability of the phab enzyme in crude extracts during prolonged and difficult procedures to isolate chloroplasts from bs strands.

effects on fatty acid synthesis 
the observed correct targeting of phaa and phab enzymes to m and bs chloroplasts prompted additional studies to examine differences in carbon availability between the two cell types for phb synthesis. plastids are the site of fas, a process that consumes acetyl-coa as substrate. acetyl-coa carboxylase  catalyses the first committed step in fas by converting acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa and phaa would therefore compete with it for the common substrate.to determine if phb production affects fas in our transgenic lines, the total fatty acid content was measured in leaves of low , medium  and high polymer-producing  and wild type switchgrass plants grown in soil for two months. no statistically significant differences in total fatty acid content were observed between the wild type and transgenic lines hp, mp <dig> and mp <dig> . the leaves of transgenic line lp, however, contained slightly less fatty acids  than the other samples. this may be due to a position effect of the transgene insertion since all the transgenic lines analysed in the present study are independent transformation events.

we have shown previously that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis results in increased production of phb in sugarcane  <cit>  but did not determine if this was due to increased production in m chloroplasts. to gain an understanding of how this affects the distribution of the polymer between bs and m, switchgrass plants in tissue culture were treated with quizalofop, a herbicide from the aryloxyphenoxypropionate group which inhibits accase activity  <cit> . the plants were regenerated from immature inflorescence-derived callus cultures initiated from two high producers, one of which was also used for other experiments in this study . a concentration-dependent increase in polymer levels accompanied by a reduction in the content of total fatty acids  in plants treated with the highest quizalofop concentrations tested) was measured in the herbicide-treated plants compared to the non-treated plants from both lines . a pronounced increase in the abundance of phb granules was observed in both bs and m cells of treated leaves as visualized by nile blue a staining .

possible differences in the effect of inhibiting fas on polymer production in developing leaf tissue, where demand for fatty acids is high  <cit> , and in mature leaf tissue, where the highest phb levels are measured  <cit> , were also investigated. whole sugarcane leaves of line lp at increasing stages of maturity, starting from the 1st fully unfurled leaf with visible dewlap down to the fifth and oldest leaf , were analysed for phb content two weeks post-treatment with fluazifop-p-butyl, a structural analogue of quizalofop. in the non-treated transgenic plants, phb content was lowest in the youngest leaves and increased with leaf age until l <dig>  while in l <dig> no significant increase in phb was observed . fluazifop-p-butyl applied at a concentration of 100 μm caused a significant increase in phb content in l <dig> and l <dig> , l <dig> , and l <dig>  with the largest increases in phb accumulation observed in the younger leaves . phb content increased in l <dig> from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % dw, a  <dig>  fold increase. the polymer content increased  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold in l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig>  respectively. the increase in phb in l <dig>  the oldest leaf, from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % dw was not statistically significant. as in switchgrass, the abundance of phb granules increased in both bs and m cells in treated sugarcane leaves .

starch and sucrose accumulation
the previously observed lack of starch granules in the bs plastids of polymer producing switchgrass as visualized by tem  <cit>  suggested that phb biosynthesis causes a significant reduction in starch accumulation. in this study, starch, sucrose, and glucose contents were measured in four month old phb producing switchgrass and sugarcane plants . in general, both the starch and sucrose levels measured in leaves at approximately midday were inversely correlated to phb accumulation in transgenic lines . while the content of these two carbohydrates was unaffected in the lowest phb-producing lines, it was significantly reduced in lines accumulating polymer above 1% dw. in sugarcane leaves, the sucrose content dropped from approximately 5% leaf dw in wild type to about 1% dw in the high phb-producing lines. starch levels in these plants decreased by as much as ten-fold. in switchgrass, sucrose levels decreased from 3% dw to  <dig> % dw and starch content showed a four-fold decrease in the highest phb-producing line compared to the wild-type control. in sugarcane, glucose also dropped significantly with increased phb production whereas glucose content in switchgrass leaves was not significantly affected by phb production. the sugarcane line mp <dig> and the switchgrass medium producers mp <dig> and mp <dig> with significantly lower sugar and starch contents were similar to wild type plants in terms of leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and biomass yield .

discussion
phb enzymes are equally abundant and active in m and bs cells
in our first study of plastid-targeted phb production in sugarcane, where the phb pathway genes were all driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter, both fluorescent staining patterns and tems demonstrated the lack of phb accumulation in m chloroplasts  <cit> . this cell specific pattern of polymer accumulation appears to be promoter independent as it did not occur when pha production was targeted to the peroxisomes using the same promoter  <cit> . more recently, we used the maize cab-m <dig> promoter to express the phb genes in switchgrass and sugarcane and although some phb accumulated in m plastids, it was much less than the polymer detected in bs cells  <cit> . differential expression of transgenes in m and bs cells is not thought to contribute to this disparity in product accumulation  <cit>  since the cab-m <dig> gene is known to be expressed in both types of cells in maize yielding more abundant transcripts in m cells  <cit> . greater phb production in bs chloroplasts has also been observed with the rice ubiquitin  <dig> promoter  <cit>  in both switchgrass  <cit>  and sugarcane  <cit> . in the present study, we have confirmed that the signal peptide of the small subunit of rubisco from pea effectively targets the phb biosynthesis enzymes to both m and bs chloroplasts of sugarcane and switchgrass  as previously shown in maize  <cit> . enzyme assays also showed that phb enzyme activity is retained following targeting to m plastids and that it is equivalent to that found in the bs plastids . together these results suggest that anomalous targeting of the phb biosynthesis enzymes to m plastids is not a contributing factor to low levels of polymer accumulation in this cell type as previously speculated  <cit> .

diversion of acetyl-coa to phb does not affect total fatty acid content
in chloroplasts, phb biosynthesis competes directly with de novo fatty acid biosynthesis for substrate since both pathways use acetyl-coa. despite this competition, phb production in in switchgrass leaves did not reduce the total fatty acid content . this has also been observed in transgenic arabidopsis where substantial production of phb up to ~40% dw resulted in no net changes in total fatty acids  <cit> . nawrath et al.  <cit>  reported that high polymer producing arabidopsis plants  grew normally leading the authors to speculate that a significant increase in the net flux through the plastidic acetyl-coa pool might occur in response to the introduction of a phb carbon sink and that mechanisms might exist to enhance synthesis of acetyl-coa in response to demand.

inhibition of fatty acid synthesis enhances phb biosynthesis in m cells
acetyl-coa carboxylase , which catalyses the first committed step of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and thus is the major flux-controlling enzyme of the pathway  <cit> , competes directly with the thiolase for acetyl-coa. chemical inhibition of accase has previously been shown to increase phb production in both c <dig> <cit>  and c <dig> plants  <cit> . when fatty acid biosynthesis was inhibited in developing sugarcane leaves, phb production increased four-fold  indicating that substantial flux can be redirected to polymer synthesis. a significant increase in polymer accumulation was most apparent in m chloroplasts as visualized by fluorescence microscopy, but was also detected in bs chloroplasts in both sugarcane and switchgrass . this supports our hypothesis that access to substrate is the main contributing factor to low levels of phb accumulation in mesophyll chloroplasts.

we found that the rate of polymer accumulation in the leaves of non-treated phb producing sugarcane is greatest during leaf maturation and plateaus as the leaf completes development . the state of leaf maturity also affects interaction between fatty acid and phb biosynthetic pathways. in developing leaves, a large flux of carbon through fatty acid synthesis supports the formation and elongation of new cells  <cit> . indeed, accase protein abundance was recently shown to peak sharply in the elongating zone of the developing maize leaf, where maximum rates of fatty acid synthesis are required to support plant growth  <cit> . inhibition of this pathway during leaf development in phb-producing transgenic sugarcane allows a large flux of carbon to be diverted to phb synthesis which normally would not be readilly accessible due to substrate competition. in the fully differentiated leaf, where the fatty acid synthesis is lower, its inhibition does not significantly improve phb production.

phb production affects gluconeogenesis and starch biosynthesis
the previously reported absence of starch granules in bs chloroplasts of high phb producing switchgrass plants  <cit>  suggested that polymer synthesis affects carbon partitioning. the results presented here demonstrated significantly decreased levels of starch and sucrose in high phb producers  suggesting reduced synthesis rate and/or premature degradation. glucose levels in sugarcane were also significantly decreased with high levels of phb production, whereas switchgrass retained its low glucose content independent of polymer synthesis.

taken together, the experimental data suggests that the phb producing plants have to readjust carbon fluxes to account for the added sink, and that this adjustment comes at the expense of starch, not fatty acids. reducing the starch pool, that is likely not vital for growth in c <dig> plants  <cit>  is a preferable strategy for obtaining the carbon needed to supply the novel carbon sink than limiting fatty acid biosynthesis in leaves, which is critical for plant growth. since the primary location of starch in differentiated leaves of c <dig> plants is bs plastids, this may account, in part, for the difference in phb synthesis in m and bs cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the low production rate of phb in m is not due to poor targeting or activity of the phb biosynthetic pathway in m chloroplasts. evidence suggests that phb synthesis may not compete effectively with fatty acid synthesis for substrate in m cells as evidenced by increased polymer formation in m cells following chemical inhibition of accase. although sucrose and starch levels are greatly decreased in high phb producing plants, redirection of carbon from carbohydrates to phb is probably not substantial enough to account for this decrease. new strategies are required to increase phb production in c <dig> grasses to commercially relevant levels. one strategy could be to enhance the ability of the phb pathway to capture substrate under competitive conditions. a novel acetoactyl-coa synthase was recently discovered which could fill the same role as the ketothiolase in the phb pathway and has properties which suggest it may be a superior catalyst for initiation of phb production  <cit> . this might help solve the substrate accessibility issue in m plastids. another strategy could be to increase flux through c <dig> photosynthesis to produce increased levels of polymer while limiting agronomic penalties. we have recently made progress in this area  <cit>  by introducing a cyanobacterial gene encoding a bifunctional enzyme with both fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  and sedoheptulose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  activities  <cit>  into well characterized phb producing switchgrass lines by re-transformation. engineering central carbon metabolism is, however, a non-trivial exercise and requires a detailed understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of the plant system at hand. a systems biology approach to phb biosynthesis in c <dig> crops would provide new information about the regulation and function of the c <dig> and c <dig> photosynthetic pathways in m and bs cells and provide insights on cell-specific strategies to further increase carbon flow to polymer production. this knowledge is critical for optimising plant biofactories for the production of industrial materials, chemicals, and energy.
