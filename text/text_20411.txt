BACKGROUND
daily physiological and behavioural rhythms are regulated by molecular transcriptional-translational feedback circuits collectively referred to as the circadian clock  <cit> . the period of oscillation generated by the circadian pacemaker is species-specific and ranges between 23–26 h in most eukaryotes under constant darkness   <cit> . the pacemaker is entrained by environmental cues, predominantly light–dark cycles, in a process that aligns the ‘free-running’ endogenous period of the circadian oscillator to the 24-h diurnal cycle.

in the laboratory, the phenotypic impact of light has been extensively studied using light pulse experiments. in these experiments, the free-running locomotor rhythm that occurs during continuous darkness  is monitored before and after the presentation of a brief light pulse  <cit> . the response to the light depends on the stimulus intensity, phase, and light sensitivity of the organism. it is measured by comparing the phase of the rhythm before and after the light stimulus . light stimuli during early night delay rhythmic activities, whereas light stimuli during late night advance rhythmic activities. stimuli during the subjective day have little or no effect on phase shift.

in drosophila, the light resetting of the clock is mediated primarily by cryptochrome , a blue-light photoreceptor  <cit> . upon light activation, cry interacts with timeless , another photosensitive protein, resulting in tim degradation  <cit> . other proteins, such as jetlag   <cit> , slimb  <cit> , cop <dig> signalosome  <cit> , and cullin- <dig>  <cit> , have also been shown to regulate the accumulation of tim. a recent study in drosophila s <dig> cells also identified brwd <dig>  a wd <dig> protein, as an e <dig> ligase that is required for cry degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . this simplified circuit suggests that light resetting of the clock is mediated by cry and tim. however, it is clear that many more genes are involved in this response, some of which may be activated by light at the transcriptional level  <cit> .

a broad transcriptional response to light pulses has been shown in various studies . in mammals, light is transmitted via the retinal ganglion cells to the rhythmic cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus  <cit> . this mediates the release of glutamate that binds n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which increases calcium influx in the suprachiasmatic nucleus  <cit> . subsequent activation of mapk results in the phosphorylation of creb that binds to cre elements within per <dig> and per <dig> promoters  to activate their transcription. light-activated genes represent a broad range of functional classes, such as stress response, dna repair  <cit> , cell cycle  <cit> , and various metabolic pathways   <cit> .

in drosophila, microarray analysis has demonstrated a profound impact of light on gene expression, with large numbers of transcripts driven by a clock-independent system  <cit> . the activation of this subset of light-induced transcripts require the no receptor potential a  gene, which is involved in visual transduction  <cit> . however, little is known about the immediate or early transcriptional changes associated with light-induced phase shifts in drosophila. here, we aimed to identify genes whose expression is modulated by an early-night light pulse and to explore the role of candidate genes in circadian light photosensitivity.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes induced by light
analysis of the replicate microarrays within each condition  showed that the intensity captured per probe across the whole chip was highly correlated . as shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  that respond to light stimulation, at a false discovery rate threshold of 10 %. a subset of degs was randomly selected and tested by quantitative real-time pcr. out of  <dig> genes,  <dig>  showed a significant difference and the same trend as in the microarray experiment . one of the degs is period , a gene known to modulate circadian clock and its outputs. our results showed that per is downregulated by light stimulation during early night. a similar rapid decrease  of per mrna following a light pulse at zeitgeber time   <dig> has been previously reported  <cit> . this observation further confirms the critical role of the transcriptional feedback loop in light-induced phase shifting of the clock.fig.  <dig> identification of differentially expressed genes associated with early-night light response. volcano plot showing the negative log <dig> of the false discovery rate value  against log <dig> of the fold change . the differentially expressed genes at a false discovery rate <  <dig>  are depicted in red



gene ontology functional enrichment analysis
to explore the biological significance of each deg, we used the clusterprofiler bioinformatics tool to analyse gene ontology  category enrichment  <cit> . using hypergeometric tests for enrichment at a p value < . <dig> and adjusted for multiple testing, the degs were classified into  <dig> functional groups consisting of  <dig> molecular functions,  <dig> cellular components, and  <dig> biological processes. additional file 1: table s <dig> provides a complete list of the supplementary material. we found the go terms for biological processes to be significantly enriched in response to stimulus , whereas those for molecular functions were enriched in gated channel activity  and ion channel activity  . for the cellular components, go terms related to extracellular region and plasma membrane were the most enriched , suggesting that most of the degs were active in these two cellular compartments. one of the biological processes that represents a high proportion of the degs is biological regulation  and consists of genes involved in gene regulation and chromatin remodelling. from this analysis,  <dig> genes listed in table  <dig> were selected for behavioural characterisation.table  <dig> genes selected for functional analysis

functional analysis of chromatin remodelling genes
eight genes associated with chromatin remodelling were tested for their roles in circadian behaviour using available null mutants and dsrnai transgenic flies . each gene was downregulated in clock neurons  using the tim-gal <dig> driver with uasdicer <dig>  the flies’ phase responses at zt  <dig> were studied. the control flies expressed a single copy of either uas-ir or timg4 > dcr <dig> in the same genetic background as in the experimental line. there was no significant difference between the control and experimental flies in their light response, with a typical delay phase shift of  <dig> –4 h . interestingly, the knockdown flies showed a significant reduction in their delay phase shift of about 1–2 h, as shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> phase response of flies with dsrnai knockdown of chromatin remodelling genes. phase response  to zt  <dig> light pulse, measured as the phase difference between pulsed and unpulsed flies. dsrnai in clock neurons was driven in clock cells using a timgal <dig> driver . in the control experiment, flies carried only the single uas  or the timgal <dig>  transgene. note that the same set of gal <dig> data is shown with each genotype for clarity. the plotted error bars signify the standard error mean for each genotype, and  <dig> flies were used per genotype. the asterisk indicates a significant difference between the treatment and the control . the double asterisks  indicates when p < . <dig>  and the single asterisk  indicates when p < . <dig> from anova with post hoc analysis using the tukey test



we were unable to test the light response in nejire and su3- <dig> rnai knockdown flies because of lethality. however, we tested the light response of su3- <dig> null mutants . all the mutant strains were significantly less sensitive to the light pulse compared to their respective controls, with the exception of kr-h1kg <dig>  which showed no significant difference from controls . it is noteworthy that most of nipped-akg <dig> and pscey <dig> flies displayed a significantly reduced or complete lack of locomotor activity during the dark phase but became active again in the light phase , representing prolonged uninterrupted bouts of sleep.fig.  <dig> light response in mutant flies and their background controls. phase delays in locomotor activity following a light pulse at zt  <dig>  are shown. the error bars were based on sem of each genotype from an independent t test . ** p < .0001; * p < .05

we also tested the effect of exposure to continuous light  on the knockdown flies. the ll condition drives wild-type flies into arrhythmicity. this phenotype allows identification of mutants with defective circadian light input  <cit> . under ll conditions, all the tested rnai transgenic flies showed a significant increase in their rhythmicity compared to their respective controls, particularly with kr-h <dig>  and nipped-a , where >50 % of flies were rhythmic .

analysis of genes associated with ion channel and cellular communication
we selected an additional  <dig> genes , which represented various enriched functional categories in our degs. these categories included six genes for alternative splicing  processes and eight genes for light response, neuronal communication, and sodium/calcium ionic balance processes. we tested the contribution of these genes to circadian behaviour using various dsrnai knockdown transgenic flies. in response to a light stimulus at zt  <dig>  flies carrying a single transgene  responded with a typical delay of  <dig> –4 h . however, the expression of the rnai resulted in a significantly reduced light response  in  <dig> out of the  <dig> tested genes .fig.  <dig> light response of flies expressing dsrnai targeting various differentially expressed genes. phase delays in locomotor activity following a light pulse at zt  <dig>  are shown. the error bars were based on sem of each genotype from an independent t test . ** p < . <dig>  * p < .05



we also tested the activity of flies under ll . strikingly, the proportion of rhythmic individuals was substantially elevated in rnai transgenic flies targeting thor , nrv <dig> , nf <dig> , cg <dig> , and fmr <dig> , with 30 % to 80 % rhythmic flies.fig.  <dig> behavioural rhythmicity in constant light  in knockdown genotypes. proportion of rhythmicity . genotype, error bars, and significant p level are denoted as in fig. 4




discussion
our aim was to identify genes whose expression is modulated by a light pulse during early night and explore their functional significance. we focused on the transcriptional response to early night stimulus , as it generally induces a more robust response than the advanced phase shift in the late night  <cit> . we identified  <dig> genes for which transcript levels were significantly altered in response to a light pulse, at a false discovery rate cut-off of 10 % .

informed by our go enrichment analysis, we characterised the roles of some genes associated with chromatin remodelling, ion channel activity, and cellular communication. previous studies, mostly in mice, have revealed the role of histone methylation, acetylation, and deacetylation in the circadian clock  <cit> . light stimulation modulates histone remodelling in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus  <cit>  by inducing phosphorylation of ser- <dig> in h <dig> and acetylation at the promoters of mper <dig> or mper <dig>  <cit> . we noted that light pulses downregulate the expression of nej and trithorax in the fly brain . both genes are known to drive histone acetylation and h3k <dig> methylation, a remodelling linked with gene activation. another gene of interest, su3- <dig>  is upregulated in response to light and is known to be associated with gene suppression  <cit> . nej was previously shown to act as a transcription co-activator via its histone acetyltransferase  activity  <cit> , which physically interacts with clk and clk-cyc through two of its binding sites  <cit> . if nej binding is required for activation of e-box containing clock genes, then its downregulation by a light pulse as evident from our data would result in attenuation of the circadian cycle and a delay. trithorax, which was also downregulated in our data, interacts with nej to prevent polycomb-mediated gene silencing by inhibiting h3lys  <dig> trimethylation  <cit> . indeed, our circadian behaviour results confirmed that changes in the expression of trithorax and su3- <dig> affect circadian light sensitivity and the phase of rhythmic activities. our data also suggest that histone remodelling, as in mammals, is involved in the dipteran clock light response, possibly by interacting with the clk-cyc complex.

another theme that was apparent among the enriched functions of light-induced transcripts related to cellular communication . for instance, the predicted molecular function of cg <dig> is ionotropic glutamate receptor activity, which mediates excitatory synaptic transmission. glutamate has been previously shown to be essential for circadian light responses in mammals  <cit> , so perhaps downregulating cg <dig> by light stimulation reduced the clock’s light sensitivity by influencing glutamate activity in the fly. nervana <dig> , another gene in this go term, plays a critical role in regulating intracellular ca2+ levels via the na+/ca2+ exchange mechanism  <cit> . by downregulating nrv <dig> in the clock neurons, the flies’ responses to light were significantly reduced, and about 80 % of them maintained rhythmic activity in the ll condition. interestingly, the other subunit of nrv <dig> was also downregulated in response to light in this study, though it was not selected for further analysis. this again highlights a role for intracellular signalling and ion exchange in the clock’s light response. interestingly, a recent imaging study of whole-brain explant cultures  <cit>  reveals that a light pulse causes rapid desynchrony among clock cells, followed by gradual emergence of synchrony . these findings underscore the importance of cellular communication genes in the light response.

the roles of the genes that we identified, such as nf <dig>  nrv <dig>  and calx in ca2+ regulation, underscore the role of this pathway in the light response. this role was previously demonstrated in light-induced phase shifts in vertebrates  <cit> . the substantial rhythmicity in ll of nrv <dig> and nf <dig> rnai flies  suggests that these are important loci for circadian light input. in general, these findings reinforce the njus-sulzman-hastings membrane model of the circadian clock  <cit> , in which feedback interactions between membrane ion transport systems and ion concentration gradients modulate cell excitability and drive circadian oscillations.

because we have profiled fly heads, our survey largely represents transcriptional changes in the compound eyes, given their large proportion of the volume of the fly’s head. this approach allows our data to be compared with the early circadian-clock studies, which also profiled fly heads . however, many light-responsive degs may be expressed in non-clock cells. additionally, we used the timgal <dig> driver in our functional assays. this driver is expressed both in clock neurons in the brain and in photoreceptors in the eyes  <cit> . consequently, the effects that we see are mediated either via the eyes, via clock cells, or via both. however, three degs  are known to be enriched in clock cells  <cit> . furthermore, the lack of behavioural effect of genes that change in expression on early-light response might be due to their expression in non-tim cells. future experiments using techniques for profiling specific clock neurons  <cit>  would be valuable for identifying light input pathways within the clock.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the early transcriptional response to a pulse of light early at night involves a broad range of biological functions. in particular, this study invokes the role of intracellular cation balance and the role of chromatin remodelling in regulating light-induced phase changes in circadian behaviour.
