BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is recognized to play a causative role in the pathogenesis of various gastroduodenal diseases including gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue  lymphoma  <cit> . however, only a minority of h. pylori-infected patients will develop severe manifestations, indicating that the clinical outcome is dependent on interactions between bacterial virulence, and host-related and environmental factors.

gastric cancer is still a significant health problem in asian countries. more than 56% of newly diagnosed gastric cancers arise in asia, of which 42% are reported from china and 12% from japan . however the incidence of gastric cancer varies greatly, even among different regions of asia. based on the age-standardized incidence rate  of gastric cancer, asian countries can be categorized as high-risk , intermediate-risk  or low-risk . in contrast, the prevalence of h. pylori infection is similar among these countries, being relatively high in the elderly population  <cit> . thus, although the association between h. pylori infection and the development of gastric cancer has been well established, it is still unclear why there is such a wide variation in the incidence of gastric cancer among asian countries, an issue that has been referred to as the "asian enigma" or "asian paradox"  <cit> .

recent molecular epidemiologic data suggest that genetic diversity of h. pylori might be partly responsible for this phenomenon. a large number of studies have investigated the roles of putative virulence factors of h. pylori, the best studied being the caga and vaca genes. the structure of the 3' repeat region of the caga gene varies between strains from western countries and those from east asian countries  <cit> ; east asian type caga strains are reported to be more virulent than their western counterparts  <cit> .

h. pylori can be divided into five subtypes based on the structure of the right-end junction motif of the cag pathogenicity island , which can be a useful molecular marker for distinguishing isolates from different geographical areas  <cit> . generally, type i is common in isolates from western countries, type ii in east asian countries, and type iii mainly in south asia  <cit> . types iv and v are relatively rare compared with the other types, but type v has been found in a few strains from india and thailand  <cit> .

there is considerable variation in vacuolation activity among h. pylori strains  <cit> , primarily due to differences of vaca gene structure in the signal region  and the middle region   <cit> . among the s <dig> genotype, s1/m <dig> is toxic for a wider range of epithelial cells than s1/m <dig>  <cit> . the vaca s2/m <dig> strains are virtually non-toxic  <cit>  and are rarely associated with diseases  <cit> . importantly, most of the h. pylori strains isolated from countries with a high incidence of gastric cancer such as japan and south korea concurrently possess virulent genotypes such as vaca s1/m <dig> and east asian type caga  <cit> . in contrast, in countries with a low incidence of gastric cancer such as thailand and india, a considerable proportion of h. pylori isolates have less virulent genotypes, such as vaca m <dig> and western type caga  <cit> .

vietnam is located on the borderline between regions with high and low risk of gastric cancer. interestingly, the asr of gastric cancer in vietnam was  <dig>  in  <dig>  which is considered to be intermediate  http://www-dep.iarc.fr/. moreover, despite the similarity in ethnicity and dietary factors, as well as the prevalence of h. pylori infection, the asr of gastric cancer in the northern city of hanoi is approximately  <dig>  times higher than that in the southern city of ho chi minh http://www-dep.iarc.fr/. we hypothesized that the h. pylori genotypes would differ between strains isolated from the two cities. currently, however, there are few data about h. pylori genotypes isolated from vietnam  <cit> . we therefore attempted to investigate several h. pylori genetic factors regarded as virulence or molecular epidemiologic markers in h. pylori isolates from vietnam.

RESULTS
patients and h. pylori
we recruited a total of  <dig> vietnamese patients , aged  <dig> to  <dig> years , of whom  <dig> were from hanoi and  <dig> were from ho chi minh. twenty-five patients were judged to have peptic ulcer disease  and  <dig> had chronic gastritis .

classification of the caga gene according to the pre-epiya region
we analyzed the sequences of the caga glu-pro-ile-tyr-ala  repeat region and upstream sequence of the epiya region of h. pylori isolated from ho chi minh and hanoi, located in the southern and northern parts of vietnam, respectively. except for five cases associated with caga-negative strains, the epiya repeat region and pre-epiya region of the remaining  <dig> strains were successfully sequenced. the majority of vietnamese strains  had an east asian type epiya repeat with three epiya motifs , and only  <dig> strains  had a western type epiya repeat with three epiya motifs  .

n.d.: could not be determined.

* both s <dig> and s <dig> were detected in one case.

â€  the prevalence of vaca m <dig> is significantly higher in hanoi than in ho chi minh, p <  <dig> 

interestingly, about  <dig> bp upstream of the first epiya motif, we found that several strains carried a 39-bp or 18-bp deletion . all strains with the 39-bp and 18-bp deletion had an east asian type epiya repeat and  <dig> of  <dig>  strains without the deletion had a western type epiya repeat. thus, the east asian type was subdivisible into two groups according to the upstream sequence of the epiya repeat region: the 39-bp and 18-bp deletion types. importantly, the majority of vietnamese strains  had the 18-bp deletion, irrespective of geographical location  . in contrast, only 13%  of the isolates carried the 39-bp deletion. in this study, we designated the 18-bp deletion type as the vietnamese pre-epiya type, and the 39-bp deletion type as the east asian pre-epiya type. three types of pre-epiya region were distinguishable by simple pcr  using primer sets covering the caga pre-epiya region, as described in methods. however, there was no relationship between pre-epiya types and clinical outcome in this vietnamese population .

genotypes of the cag right-end junction
it has been reported that the cag right-end junction motif can be classified into five groups  <cit> . we found that type ii was the most common , followed by type i  and type iii  . the remaining three strains could not be categorized into any genotype. this result was consistent with previous data showing that type ii was the most common among h. pylori isolates from east asian countries  <cit> . interestingly, type i, which was considered to be specific for western strains, was significantly more common in strains isolated in ho chi minh  than in those originating from hanoi  . in contrast, type ii was significantly more common in hanoi  than in ho chi minh  . there was no significant relationship between the cag right-end junction types and clinical outcome in this vietnamese population .

type ii was very common in h. pylori strains carried by vietnamese  and also in the east asian pre-epiya type  . in contrast, among strains with a western pre-epiya type, type ii accounted for 40%  and type i for the remaining 60% .

n.d.: not determined

genotypes of the vaca genotypes
all vietnamese strains possessed the vaca s <dig> genotype and only one case from hanoi possessed both the s <dig> and s <dig> genotypes, suggesting mixed infection with two strains. the m <dig> genotype was significantly more common in strains isolated in hanoi than in those originating from ho chi minh   .

the prevalence of the vaca m <dig> genotype was significantly higher in strains isolated from peptic ulcer patients  than in those from gastritis patients  . no significant relationship was observed between m region genotypes and pre-epiya deletion types .

h. pylori genotypes and histology
we examined whether the vaca genotypes and the caga pre-epiya types were related to histological score. the five caga-negative cases were excluded from histological analysis. univariate analysis showed that the antral mononuclear cell infiltration scores were significantly higher in tissue infected with vietnamese or east asian pre-epiya types than in those infected with the western type . the east asian caga repeat type was highly associated with severe mononuclear cell infiltration  and the type iii cag right-end junction was associated with mild neutrophil infiltration  . in contrast, there was no relationship between vaca middle-region genotypes and histological score . there was no significant relationship between caga genotypes and scores for atrophy and intestinal metaplasia .

multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine which factor was related to severity of histology. in the antrum, the cag end junction type iii was significantly associated with milder neutrophil infiltration  and more severe intestinal metaplasia  . the prc of - <dig>  for the cag end junction type iii for neutrophil infiltration suggests that the neutrophil infiltration score associated with cag end junction type iii strains would be expected to be  <dig>  points lower than with type i strains. the western pre-epiya type was significantly associated with milder antral neutrophil infiltration .

prc: partial regression coefficient

in the corpus and upper corpus, there were no significant differences between h. pylori genotypes and histological features, using either univariate analysis or multiple linear regression analysis .

discussion
in this study, we identified three types of deletion located upstream of the caga 3' epiya repeat region: a 39-bp deletion, an 18-bp deletion, and lack of deletion. as of march,  <dig>  the genbank database contained  <dig> caga sequences of h. pylori that covered the pre-epiya region. alignment of these sequences revealed that several strains carried a 39-bp or 18-bp deletion. as expected, the 39-bp deletion was present in most strains isolated from east asia, but was absent in most strains from western countries . moreover, all  <dig> caga sequences with a unique 18-bp deletion type were present in asian strains , suggesting that the deletion patterns might be applicable as markers of genomic diversity among asian h. pylori isolates. although the 18-bp deletion type appears to be specific to asian strains, the precise distribution was unclear because of the small number of cases examined. among four vietnamese caga sequences deposited in genbank, three had the 18-bp deletion type and one had the 39-bp deletion type , suggesting that the 18-bp deletion type might be common in vietnamese strains. genbank data showed that the 18-bp deletion type also seemed to be common in hong kong and thailand, in addition to vietnam. however, our preliminary data showed that the prevalence of strains with the 18-bp deletion type was less than 10% in both hong kong and thailand . these data suggest that the 18-bp deletion type could be applicable as a new marker for vietnamese h. pylori strains.

through an extensive search of the genbank database in combination with our data, we showed that these types, which were designated as the western, east asian and vietnamese pre-epiya types, appear to be specific for each corresponding geographic region, and thus could be applicable as a new genetic marker for the genomic diversity of h. pylori. interestingly, there was a close relationship between the caga repeat region genotypes and the pre-epiya type. the great majority of the east asian caga repeat region type contained either the east asian or vietnamese pre-epiya type, whereas almost all of the western caga repeat region type had the western pre-epiya type. vietnamese strains could not be distinguished from other east asian strains on the basis of previous genotyping including the caga repeat region genotypes. in contrast, the novel pre-epiya types were able to distinguish vietnamese strains from other east asian strains with high sensitivity and specificity . therefore, this novel system will be useful for epidemiological studies of the distribution of vietnamese strains. notably, the vietnamese pre-epiya type is predominant in vietnam, where the incidence of gastric cancer is lower than in other east asian countries such as japan and south korea, suggesting that the pre-epiya region might have some biological functions that partly contribute to the differences in incidence of gastric cancer, although we were unable to find any differences in the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease and histological findings between east asian and vietnamese pre-epiya types in this study. further studies will be necessary to investigate the function of the pre-epiya region.

on the basis of structure, the cag right-end junction is classifiable into five subtypes  <cit> . generally, type i is common in isolates from western countries, type ii in east asian countries, and type iii mainly in south asia  <cit> . in agreement with previous data  <cit> , the majority of vietnamese strains we studied were type ii strains. interestingly, 16% of strains isolated in ho chi minh possessed type i, which was a much higher prevalence than in other east asian strains . this might explain the relatively higher frequencies of east asian-type caga amongst hanoi isolates , and hence the higher incidence of gastric cancer in that population. however, the reason for the high prevalence of type i in ho chi minh is currently unknown. there is no evidence for a greater level of interracial mixing with europeans in ho chi minh than in hanoi, particularly during the latter half of the 20th century. extensive surveys will be necessary to elucidate the geographical distribution in east asian countries. interestingly, histological data from the antrum showed that the cag end junction type iii was significantly associated with mild neutrophil infiltration and severe intestinal metaplasia. this is the first study to have demonstrated a relationship between cag end junction type and histological features; however the number of type iii strains in this study was very small  and further work will be necessary to clarify the importance of type iii genotypes in countries where the prevalence of type iii is high .

the multifactorial model of gastric malignant transformation is currently accepted, and not only h. pylori virulence factors, but also other factors such as host genetic susceptibility and environmental factors will undoubtedly play certain roles. in vietnam, the incidence of gastric cancer in the northern city of hanoi is reported to be  <dig>  times higher than that in the southern city of ho chi minh. importantly, the two cities share a lot of similarity in terms of ethnicity, living standards, lifestyle and dietary habits. therefore, these two cities can serve as a good model for understanding the role h. pylori virulence factors in the development of gastric cancer. in this study, the prevalence of the vaca m <dig> type, which is currently considered to be more toxic and more closely associated with the development of gastric cancer than the m <dig> type, was significantly higher in strains isolated in hanoi than those originating from ho chi minh. interestingly, compared with other east asian countries such as japan and korea, where the incidence of gastric cancer is high, the prevalence of the vaca m <dig> type in vietnam is much lower  <cit> . taken together, our data support the hypothesis that the vaca m <dig> genotype is closely associated with gastric carcinogenesis and may provide a partial explanation for the asian paradox. in addition, we have also found that the vaca m <dig> genotype was related to the development of peptic ulcers in the vietnamese population. although we failed to obtain evidence that m <dig> strains induced more severe gastric injury in terms of histology, our current data support the hypothesis that m <dig> strains are more toxic than m <dig> strains, and that the m <dig> genotype play a major role in countries where other factors are relatively homogeneous. overall, we propose that examination of h. pylori genotypes in strains isolated from two cities in vietnam, ho chi minh and hanoi, would be useful for investigating the roles of h. pylori-related factors in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal disease.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found three types of deletion in the pre-epiya region of the caga gene: a 39-bp deletion, an 18-bp deletion, and no deletion, and demonstrated that the caga genotype could be applicable as a new genetic marker of genomic diversity in h. pylori. in fact, the 18-bp deletion type appeared to be a marker of vietnamese h. pylori. comparison of two geographically distant cities in vietnam, hanoi and ho chi minh, showed that the vaca m <dig> genotype, thought to be more toxic than the vaca m <dig> type, is more prevalent in hanoi, where the incidence of gastric cancer is higher than in ho chi minh. our data support the hypothesis that the vaca m <dig> type is closely associated with gastric carcinogenesis.
