BACKGROUND
taxonomy of the genus cebus is a controversial subject. members of this genus display intense variations in fur color and pattern depending on age, gender and geographical location  <cit> . despite these variations, most authors agree that cebus comprises five species: c. apella, c. albifrons, c. capucinus, c. olivaceus and c. kaapori  <cit> . groves   <cit>  published a new taxonomy for the genus, where he recognizes four species with subspecies: cebus apella , c. libidinosus , c. nigritus  and c. xanthosternos. silva j√∫nior   <cit>  classification has some differences. for instance, groves   <cit>  recognizes robustus as a subspecies of c. nigritus while silva junior   <cit>  recognizes it as a full species.

cytogenetic studies on cebus have shown that the diploid number ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> chromosomes. the species of this genus have large blocks of constitutive heterochromatin, mainly found in interstitial and distal regions, which displays intraspecific variation, few biarmed chromosomes and secondary constrictions in two acrocentric pairs  <cit> . to date, human chromosomal painting has been used to analyze three species of cebus: c. capucinus  <cit> c. apella  <cit>  and c. nigrivittatus  <cit> .

interspecies chromosomal comparisons of cebus have been performed using g- and q-banding patterns. these comparisons  <cit>  suggest that c. capucinus, c. albifrons and c. apella share  <dig> chromosome pairs, c. capucinus and c. albifrons share  <dig> pairs and c. capucinus and c. apella share  <dig> pairs. among these three species, the karyotype of c. capucinus most resembles the putative ancestor, as all chromosomes found in c. capucinus are observed in c. albifrons and c. apella. furthermore, c. albifrons and c. apella seem to have been independently derived from an ancestor with a karyotype similar to c. capucinus. the c. capucinus karyotype is closer to c. albifrons than to c. apella.

zoo-fish comparative chromosome painting is a powerful method for detecting chromosome homologies between species and for resolving phylogenetic controversies. this study compared the chromosome homologies present among cebus apella paraguayanus , cebus apella robustus , cebus albifrons  and cebus olivaceus  using g-banding and chromosome painting with whole chromosome probes derived from humans and saguinus oedipus. our results were compared with previous reports to propose a phylogeny for these species, using chromosomal characters in a parsimony analysis.

methods
metaphasic chromosomes from four cebus taxa  were obtained by lymphocyte  <cit>  and fibroblast culture. karyotypes were organized following the protocol of matayoshi et al.   <cit> .

g-banding was performed using the methods of seabright   <cit> . fish experiments were performed in all species using s. oedipus whole chromosome probes  <cit>  and  <dig> different whole chromosome probes taken from humans . probes were organized into four pools  as previously described  <cit> . the probes were then labeled by dop-pcr  <cit>  using biotin-dutp, digoxigenin-dutp  and tamra-dutp . in situ hybridization and detection were performed using the protocols of neusser et al.   <cit>  and de oliveira et al.   <cit> . nomenclatures of chromosomes and chromosome segments were consistent with neusser et al.   <cit>  and de oliveira et al.   <cit> . human and s. oedipus probes were applied to all of the taxa except c. olivaceus, which was analyzed solely using human probes.

g-banded metaphases were captured using a zeiss iii photomicroscope with imagelink hq film manufactured by kodak. fish/dapi metaphases were captured with a ccd camera under a zeiss axiophot microscope. images were analyzed using adobe photoshop  <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis was performed by applying a cladistic method with parsimony criteria. a basic data matrix was built by comparing chromosomal differences among species, as determined by fish or g-banding. previously reported chromosome painting data was used for c. apella sp.  <cit>  and c. capucinus  <cit> . saimiri sciureus and callithrix jacchus were used as outgroups. paup  software was used to build the cladogram, which was then tested using the bootstrap method  <cit> .

RESULTS
cytogenetic analysis
diploid number analysis confirmed a range of  <dig> to  <dig> chromosomes in the genus cebus. cebus apella paraguayanus and c. a. robustus had  <dig> chromosomes . cebus albifrons had  <dig> chromosomes , as did c. olivaceus . sex chromosomes were similar in all the species, with submetacentric x chromosome and a small acrocentric chromosomes y chromosome.

with the exception of the human y chromosome paint, all human and s. oedipus probes painted chromosomes of c. a. paraguayanus , c. a. robustus , c. albifrons . constitutive heterochromatin regions did not show any signal of hybridization on any of the species. representative results from fish experiments with human probes are shown in figures 1a1;a2;b1;2;c1;c <dig> and d, while experiments using s. oedipus probes are shown in figures 1a3;b <dig> and 1c <dig> 

cebus apella paraguayanus and cebus apella robustus
cebus apella paraguayanus and c. a. robustus displayed similar karyotypes. human probes revealed  <dig> homologous segments. synteny was conserved in  <dig> human chromosomes: hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig>  hsa  <dig> and hsa x, which corresponded to cap  <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap  <dig>  cap  <dig> and cap x in cebus, respectively. human associations commonly found in other species of platyrrhini were found in these taxa, including 2b/16b, 3a/ <dig>  5/7a, 8a/ <dig>  10a/16a and 14/15a. soe painting probes revealed  <dig> homologous segments. eighteen conserved segments were identified between these c. apella subspecies and s. oedipus.

the soe x and y probes hybridized to the respective sex chromosomes of both cebus species. the g-banded karyotype of c. a. paraguayanus, together with a summary of the chromosome painting results, is shown in figure 2a. figure 2b shows the karyotype of c. a. robustus. the c. a. paraguayanus male displayed a reciprocal translocation of segments homologous to hsa 2a e 10a, which was confirmed using the soe  <dig> and soe  <dig> probes . the two species differed in the distribution of constitutive heterochromatin, where the most obvious difference was the absence of the distal heterochromatic block in chromosome  <dig> of c. a. robustus .

cebus albifrons
results of this study revealed the conservation of  <dig> human chromosomes , corresponding to c. albifrons chromosomes cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig>  cal  <dig> and cal x. four human chromosomes  hybridized to a single chromosome of c. albifrons, but associated with other segments. we found seven human associations that were previously identified in platyrrhini . s. oedipus probes revealed  <dig> homologous segments .

cebus olivaceus
results of this study revealed the conservation of nine human chromosomes , corresponding to c. olivaceus chromosomes cgr  <dig>  cgr  <dig>  cgr  <dig>  cgr  <dig>  cgr  <dig>  cgr  <dig>  cgr  <dig>  cgr  <dig> and cgr  <dig>  we did not use human sex chromosome probes on this species. four human probes  hybridized to a single chromosome of c. olivaceus, but associated with other segments. seven associations were found: 2/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  5/16/ <dig>  8/ <dig>  10a/ <dig>  14/15/ <dig> and 15/ <dig> . of these, 5/16/ <dig> and 15/ <dig> corresponded to autapomorphies.

comparative analysis and phylogeny
human and saguinus oedipus painting results, in combination with the g-banding results, allowed for a detailed comparison of chromosome homologies among members of the genus cebus. a basic data matrix  was built using alternative forms of the chromosomes as characters . these characters were then used in a binary matrix . in this matrix the data of cebus apella sp are from garcia et al.   <cit>  and of c. capucinus are from richard et al.   <cit> . paup analysis resulted in a single cladogram  with  <dig> steps, a consistency index of  <dig> , a retention index of  <dig>  and a homoplasy index of  <dig> .

discussion
many reports use morphological  <cit> , molecular  <cit>  or chromosomal  <cit>  data to dissect the phylogenetic relationships among new world monkeys at the family level. however, ordering the species below the genus level is a fundamental step toward reorganizing the phylogenetic relationships among these taxa. this realization prompted us to analyze taxa from the genus cebus to better understand their chromosomal divergences and to clarify their phylogenetic positions.

all of the syntenies in the putative ancestral platyrrhini karyotype  were conserved in the cebus species, consistent with previous reports on c. apella sp.  <cit>  and c. capucinus  <cit> . our data in c. a. paraguayanus are quite similar with the one described by garcia et al.   <cit>  on c. apella sp. interestingly, the 5/7a association was found in all but one member of the genus cebus. in c. olivaceus, this association possessed an additional segment homologous to hsa <dig>  this segment probably fused in tandem with chromosome hsa <dig>  followed by a paracentric inversion that resulted in the association cgr 7/16/ <dig>  which has not been reported before in new world primates. the association 5/ <dig> is found in saimiri but not in the other members of the genus cebus. however, the segment homologous to hsa <dig> has different sizes in these species, which strongly supports the occurrence of a homoplasy. garcia et al.   <cit>  described human chromosomal painting in c. nigrivittatus, a synonymy for c. olivaceus. they did not find the hsa <dig> fragment in pair  <dig> and also the morphology of pair  <dig> is slightly different, with a short arm in our sample. this can be a consequence of a pericentric inversion or a heterochromatin heteromorphism.

associations 2b/16b and 8a/ <dig> were present without any alterations in members of the genus cebus. the association 14/15a is inverted in all cebus species, revealing a synapomorphy. in c. a. paraguayanus and c. a. robustus, this association exists in a submetacentric pair. in c. albifrons, this association exists in a metacentric chromosome due to a second inversion that gave rise to the association 15a/14/15a/ <dig>  a different inversion of hsa15a was found in c. olivaceus, changing the morphology of hsa15a from acrocentric to metacentric.

associations 12/ <dig> in c. olivaceus and 8/15/ <dig> in c. albifrons, which was confirmed by the s. oedipus association 18/10/ <dig>  explain the reduction in diploid number from  <dig> to  <dig>  an in tandem fusion, followed by a pericentric inversion, occurred in c. albifrons. conversely, a robertsonian rearrangement occurred in c. olivaceus.

chromosomal data were used to obtain a cladogram that reconstructed a possible sequence of chromosome rearrangements leading to karyotypical differentiation into the cebus genus . the cladogram supports the notion that the monophyly of cebus. c. apella sp., c. a. paraguayanus and c. a. robustus are closely related, sharing two synapomorphic traits . c. capucinus occupies a more basal position, with a chromosomal composition very similar to the putative ancestral platyrrhini karyotype, consistent with previous reports by richard et al.   <cit> . the phylogenetic relationships of c. capucinus and c. albifrons, in relation to the ancestral karyotype, are not clearly defined. however, it is clear that the karyotype of c. albifrons differs from that of c. capucinus by a pericentric inversion in the 14/ <dig> association, which results in a metacentric association 15/14/15/ <dig>  we also identified an in tandem fusion, followed by a pericentric inversion involving the homologous human chromosomes hsa15b and hsa8b, in c. albifrons. as c. olivaceus is closely related to c. apella, these species share the chromosomal inversion homologous to hsa <dig>  differentiation between c. olivaceus and c. apella is possible via a pericentric inversion in the association 14/15/ <dig> and a robertsonian rearrangement in the chromosomes homologous to hsa <dig> and hsa15b on their figure 2c. garcia et al.   <cit>  left open two possibilities for chromosome  <dig> in the cebus ancestral karyotype: the ancestral form could be a metacentric like in cal, cca, and cni karyotypes or a submetacentric like in cap. our cladistic analysis has shown that the ancestral form is the metacentric.

this study used chromosome painting in conjunction with g-banding to confirm the ability of these techniques to generate consistent and reliable data. these data were interpreted using a cladistic analysis capable of generating a cladogram with a high degree of consistency. future studies should use molecular markers to further explore the phylogeny described here.

CONCLUSIONS
chromosome painting in several species of cebus allowed us to define all the rearrangements that ocurred during its speciation. it was also possible to use fish and g-banding data, both from our results and from literature, to build a cladogram that reconstructed a possible sequence of chromosome rearrangements leading to karyotypical differentiation into the cebus genus.
