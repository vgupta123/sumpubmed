BACKGROUND
domestic dogs exhibit a tremendous amount of phenotypic diversity in coat colour, skeletal proportion, and behaviour  <cit> . understanding the underlying causes of this diversity has been a prime motivation for studies on the evolutionary history of domestic dogs and the genetic basis for phenotypic traits. the common ancestor of the domestic dog is the grey wolf  <cit> . however, molecular genetic evidence suggests that there were multiple domestication and/or interbreeding events between domestic dogs and grey wolves  <cit> . the timing and location of the dog's origin remains uncertain. mitochondrial dna sequencing studies suggest an east asian origin with dates ranging from ~ <dig> to  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . in contrast, archaeological studies suggest a middle eastern, western russian or european origin approximately  <dig> - <dig>  years ago  <cit> .

in order to understand the molecular mechanism by which domestic dogs have rapidly diversified in body size, we previously identified a haplotype shared by small dogs that underlies the major-effect quantitative trait locus for size on dog chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . a ~ <dig> kb selectively swept haplotype was found spanning the promoter, exon and introns of the igf <dig> gene and was strongly associated with skeletal size. fine-mapping demonstrated that a ~ <dig> kb interval spanning intron  <dig> is most strongly associated with size variation. a short interspersed element sinec_cf integration and single nucleotide polymorphism  are in perfect linkage disequilibrium  in this interval. these markers are fixed in the majority of small distantly related dog breeds which suggests that small size evolved early in the history of domestication. our previous study showed that, with the exception of a few giant breeds , the derived 'small' snp allele was rarely observed in large dog breeds  <cit> . interestingly, the small size-associated haplotype was not observed in any wild canid surveyed, ranging from grey wolf  to island fox . however, no extensive characterization of variation across igf <dig> in grey wolf, the wild progenitor of domestic dogs, was done. this characterization is critical to the understanding of the evolutionary history of the igf <dig> gene and its role in the history of domestic dogs. in this study, we survey a variety of grey wolf populations to better understand the ancestral pattern of variation at igf <dig> with a particular focus on the distribution of the small dog haplotype and its relationship to the origin of the dog.

RESULTS
microsatellite, snp and sine  markers within igf1
the microsatellite located within the promoter region of igf <dig>  displayed a significant association with body size in the domestic dog   <cit> . specifically, the  <dig> base pair  allele is associated with large sized and the  <dig> bp allele is associated with small sized domestic dogs. the microsatellite is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the sine element and diagnostic snp  <cit> . although microsatellite alleles found in grey wolf spanned the entire range observed in dogs, the  <dig> bp allele, which is intermediate in length to the two alleles associated with body size in dogs, was found to have the highest frequency  in  <dig> grey wolves worldwide . the completely overlapping allele sizes of grey wolves and small and large domestic dogs suggest this locus is not the causal mutation for small body size in dogs.

dna sequence data confirmed the observation that no grey wolf had the diagnostic snp allele  found in the intron  <dig> region of igf <dig> in small dogs. furthermore, we genotyped  <dig> grey wolves from  <dig> populations and  <dig> individuals from five distantly related wild canids  and found that no wild canid possessed the sine element. the retrotransposon insertion and the diagnostic snp allele appear to be unique to small domestic dogs. therefore, these markers evolved uniquely in the domestic dog and are unlikely to have been segregating in the wolf ancestors of dogs.

snp genotypes
in order to investigate the evolutionary history of the igf <dig> locus and the origin of the haplotypes found in domestic dogs, we performed principal components analysis  on genotypes from  <dig> dog-derived snp markers spanning the igf <dig> interval . consistent with species level classification, domestic dogs were distinct from grey wolves and coyotes on the first pca axis . on the second pca axis, we observed separation between small and large domestic dogs and to a lesser extent between new world and old world grey wolves. furthermore, grey wolves of middle east origin were slightly closer to domestic dogs than other grey wolf populations on the first pca axis. several akita individuals, which is an ancient domestic dog breed  <cit> , were positioned between grey wolves and the main cluster of domestic dogs . outliers such as large bodied rottweiler and mastiff dog breeds were observed within the small dog cluster. these breeds were previously found to have unexpected genetic similarity to small dogs in the igf <dig> region  <cit> . the boston terrier, which is the largest breed in our 'small dog' category, was the breed most associated with the large breed cluster. however, a few individuals from other small breeds were found there as well: cavalier king charles spaniel, chihuahua, toy fox terrier, miniature schnauzer, norwich terrier and shih tzu. moreover, all except the chihuahua were previously found to exhibit some genetic similarity with large domestic dogs across the igf <dig> locus  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the snp data defined a domestic dog cluster distinct from grey wolves . further, the majority of small and large domestic dogs grouped separately from one another. no further resolution within each species was observed.

individuals homozygous for the four most common of the igf <dig>  <dig> snp marker haplotypes  were compared to homologous grey wolf and coyote haplotypes. however, haplotypes for only  <dig> of the  <dig> snps could be compared due to non-amplification of three snps in grey wolves. the wolf haplotypes most similar to the common small dog haplotype b are found in spanish  and israeli  wolves and differ from haplotype b by 3- <dig> substitutions . however, such a comparison is intrinsically limited, since these snps were ascertained in a restricted panel of domestic dogs. therefore, grey wolves may have additional variation that is undetected when using domestic dogs as a reference that could be informative for understanding the evolutionary history of the igf <dig> gene. nonetheless, this result supports the hypothesis that middle east and spanish wolves have haplotypes closest to those of small dogs.

long sequence 
in order to further characterize igf <dig> variation across grey wolf populations, we sequenced  <dig> base pairs  of intron  <dig> that directly surrounded the diagnostic 'small' snp locus and the sine element . fourteen phased haplotypes were identified from  <dig> snps and four indels . we identified  <dig> private alleles in grey wolves and  <dig> polymorphic loci. in the coyote, we identified  <dig> private alleles and  <dig> polymorphic loci. domestic dogs exhibited two private alleles and two polymorphic loci. however, these individuals were selected to be homozygous for the common and minor snp haplotypes . in this analysis, grey wolf haplotypes from israel  were most similar to haplotypes in small domestic dogs and differed from the common small dog haplotype  <dig> by 3- <dig> substitutions . the presence of the sine element and 'small' snp allele in domestic dogs was responsible for two of the observed differences. a minimum spanning network constructed from pairwise nucleotide differences also exhibited a close relationship between the small dog haplotypes  and haplotypes from israel wolves . two haplotypes  were shared between domestic dogs and grey wolves . one chinese and two italian grey wolves were homozygous for hap  <dig>  which was shared with great danes and saint bernards. one alaskan and two yellowstone grey wolf individuals possessed hap  <dig> which was shared with shih tzu and mastiff. nucleotide diversity was highest in coyote  followed by european grey wolves , and israeli grey wolves .

a neighbour-joining tree was constructed from the sequence data, which revealed that the common small haplotype clustered with haplotypes from israeli grey wolves . no other grey wolf population or domestic dog breed was included in this cluster. furthermore, the small dog and all israeli grey wolf haplotypes were ancestral to the large domestic dog haplotypes and all other grey wolf haplotypes. haplotypes from large domestic dogs clustered with grey wolves from alaska, yellowstone, italy, spain and china . based on complete dna sequence information, these results support a close affinity between the small dog haplotype and those of middle eastern grey wolves.

short sequence 
in order to verify that the tree topology was not influenced by limited sampling of wild canids, eight additional grey wolf populations were sequenced for a subset of the amplicons . amplicons were chosen to minimize cost but maximize the number of previously discovered markers that could be sequenced . based on  <dig> snps and two indels,  <dig> haplotypes and three novel snps were identified . one was private to coyotes , one was private to israeli grey wolves  and another was found in alaskan, mexican, israeli and russian grey wolves . grey wolf haplotypes from israel  as well as india and iran  were closest to the common small dog haplotype  <dig> and differed from it by 1- <dig> substitutions . a minimum spanning network constructed from pairwise nucleotide differences also exhibited a close relationship between the small dog haplotype  and haplotypes from israel, indian and iranian wolves . only two haplotypes  were shared between grey wolves and domestic dogs. several grey wolf populations shared haplotype  <dig> with the great dane. these populations included alaska, belarus, bulgaria, china, india, iran, israel, italy and ukraine. dachshunds, shih tzu and mastiff breeds shared haplotype  <dig> with alaskan, mexican, yellowstone, chinese and russian grey wolves. nucleotide diversity was highest in coyote  followed by grey wolves from the middle east . the middle east sample set included israel, iran and india. however, because israeli grey wolf samples dominated the sample set , we also estimated nucleotide diversity for each population . iranian grey wolf nucleotide diversity was  <dig>   and indian grey wolf was  <dig>  . israeli grey wolf nucleotide diversity was  <dig>  . additionally, in order to account for sampling bias in the israeli grey wolves, two individuals were sampled  <dig> times and the median nucleotide diversity was estimated to be  <dig>  . in all cases, wolves of middle eastern origin had the highest nucleotide diversity, second only to coyote.

a neighbour-joining tree showed that the common small dog haplotype clustered with israeli grey wolf haplotypes as well as india and iran. this cluster was distinct from the haplotypes associated with large dogs . the large dog-associated haplotypes were found to cluster with grey wolves from all populations except bulgaria, which fell just outside of this cluster. we also observed five israeli, one indian and one iranian grey wolf to be heterozygous for the large dog haplotype  <dig> and one of several haplotype variants  that clustered with the common small dog-associated haplotype . again, we observe a close kinship between the small dog-associated haplotype and haplotypes observed in the middle eastern grey wolves.

constraint trees
in order to further verify the topology of the phylogenetic trees that placed the common small dog haplotype with israeli grey wolf haplotypes, constraint trees were constructed for the long and short sequence data. in these trees, the common small dog-associated haplotype was constrained to cluster with each of the large dog haplotypes . for the  <dig> bp dataset, three constraint trees were constructed in which the small dog-associated common haplotype  was placed as a sister to hap  <dig>  to  and to . for the  <dig> bp dataset, three constraint trees were also constructed, in which hap  <dig> was constrained to be sister to , to hap  <dig> and to . maximum likelihood analyses of the constraint trees confirm that the likelihoods of the unconstrained trees were significantly better in all comparisons .

recombination
previously, a recombination point just 5' of the diagnostic snp locus  was identified as a critical recombination locus between the common and minor small dog-associated haplotypes   <cit> . ancestral recombination graphs from the present study suggest a similar recombination point between canfam <dig> position  <dig> and  <dig> . we note that 3' of this recombination point the two small haplotypes have identical sequences, whereas the 5' side exhibits several snp differences. in order to explore the effect recombination may have had on tree topology, we constructed neighbour-joining trees for sequences on each side of the recombination point for both sequence datasets . the topology was similar across data sets from each side of the recombination point. on the 3' side, which contains the diagnostic small dog snp locus and sine element, the large dog haplotypes clustered with haplotypes from all grey wolf populations, except red wolves with bootstrap support of 65%  and 64% . israeli haplotypes were ancestral, or sister to, small dog haplotypes in the  <dig> bp dataset  and small dog haplotypes were ancestral to those in all dogs in the  <dig> bp dataset . on the 5' side of the recombination point, many of the grey wolf haplotypes and large domestic dog haplotypes were identical. all but the common small dog haplotype, and several of the israeli  grey wolf haplotypes, clustered with support values of 97%  and 88% .

discussion
previous research identified igf <dig> as a major gene affecting skeletal size in domestic dogs  <cit> . in this study, we examined genetic variation surrounding the igf <dig> gene in the progenitor of domestic dogs in order to uncover the evolutionary history of the gene. this study confirms the absence of the derived small snp allele in the intron  <dig> region of igf <dig>  in a large sample of grey wolves and further establishes the absence of a small dog associated sine element in all wild canids and most large dog breeds. thus, the absence of both the sine element and snp allele in wild canids suggests that the mutation for small body size post-dates the domestication of dogs. presumably, the absence of these two loci in wolves may reflect a unique recombination event in domestic dogs. however, we find no evidence of recombination between the sine element and derived snp allele in domestic dogs and the derived snp allele distinguishes the associated common small  and large  haplotypes. additionally, because all small dogs possess these diagnostic mutations, the small size phenotype likely arose early in the history of domestic dogs.

although the alleles distinguishing small domestic dogs from large domestic dogs have been identified, the causal mutation for small body size has not been definitively determined. microsatellite mutations have been suggested as a potential source for rapid morphological evolution in domestic dogs and the microsatellite located in the promoter region of igf <dig> could conceivably be the causal mutation  <cit> . however, we found that the allelic range observed in large and small domestic dogs was similar to that in grey wolves and coyotes, which does not support this hypothesis. synonymous mutations in coding regions have been proposed to regulate gene expression and splicing  <cit> . from analysis of sequencing data, we found that the synonymous snp mutation within exon  <dig> was segregating in both large and small domestic dogs as well as grey wolves, which does not support this hypothesis. although additional sequencing is needed in order to identify other possible variants, the unique derived sine element and the snp allele in intron  <dig> cannot be ruled out as candidates for the causative mutation. sine elements have been found to be widely distributed throughout the dog genome and segregating in some breeds while fixed in others  <cit> . previous studies in domestic dogs have identified sine elements affecting coat colour variation, hearing and sight disorders, narcolepsy, and myopathy  <cit> . additionally, alu elements, the most frequent sine retrotransposon in humans, have been shown to affect gene regulation and splicing of mrna  <cit> . however, in the absence of any functional studies, any conclusions about the role of the snp allele and the sine element in size variation are speculative. furthermore, the snp allele and sine element are not known to be associated with any regulatory elements or splicing site.

we investigated the progenitor population for the small body size mutation by examining the pca of  <dig> dog-derived snp genotypes in a range of potential ancestral grey wolf populations. the patterns observed on the first two axes of variation were consistent with known evolutionary history. on the first axis of variation, we observed separation of domestic dogs and grey wolves, whereas along the second axis of variation we observed a large separation between large and small domestic dogs and a smaller separation between old world and new world wolves. we also observed a slightly closer kinship of middle eastern grey wolves with domestic dogs. thus, snp genotype data reveal ancient and recent evolutionary relationships in wild and domestic canids.

in order to explore this relationship further, we analysed sequence data directly spanning the diagnostic sine element and snp locus. nucleotide diversity estimates in grey wolf populations were highest in middle eastern grey wolves for the  <dig> bp dataset and european grey wolves for the  <dig> bp dataset. however, the  <dig> bp dataset contained the greatest number of samples per group, which should more accurately represent diversity estimates. in this dataset, middle eastern grey wolves had the greatest nucleotide diversity even when sampling variation was taken into account by equalizing the number of samples in the population. haplotypes from middle eastern grey wolves were consistently found to have the greatest similarity to those in small domestic dogs for both the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp datasets. additionally, phylogenetic analyses suggested a closer kinship of the common small domestic dog haplotype with middle eastern grey wolf haplotypes. although bootstrap support values are not high, snp pca and sequence analysis all are concordant with a middle eastern origin for the small domestic dog haplotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
the middle east includes part of the fertile crescent where farming began and was the origin of many domesticated plants and animals including cereals, cats and goats  <cit> . the region has been suggested as the site of dog domestication based on archeological data  <cit> . specifically, several archaeological sites in the middle east have some of the earliest domestic dog remains, dating to  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . however, sites in belgium, germany and western russia contain older remains   <cit> . many of the domestic dogs from middle eastern sites are small whereas those from belgium, germany and western russia are larger in size, which supports our hypothesis that small body size evolved early in the history of domestic dogs and probably in the middle east. reduction in body size is a common feature of domestication and appears early in other domesticated taxa including cattle, pigs and goats  <cit> . indeed it is a morphological attribute researchers have used to distinguish early domestic dogs from their grey wolf progenitor  <cit> . other features include shortening of the muzzle, large crowned teeth and paedomorphic characteristics. therefore, in concordance with past archeological studies, our molecular analysis provides strong evidence for the early evolution of small size in dogs in the middle east, more than  <dig>  years ago.

genetic studies exploring the evolutionary history of domestic dogs have focused primarily on mtdna  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis and haplotype diversity of mtdna sequence data from a global sampling of grey wolves and domestic dogs specifically suggested an east asian origin for domestic dogs  <cit> . by contrast, our results show that the small dog haplotype is closely related to haplotypes in wolves from the middle east and is consistent with an ancient origin in this region of small domestic dogs. small dogs have been recorded in  <dig>  to  <dig>  year old burial sites in the levant  <cit>  and new snp data further suggest it as a primary centre for dog domestication  <cit> . the lack of concordance between mtdna and nuclear analysis could reflect differences in sampling, a female/male bias in dispersal or breed specific bias in inbreeding and population size  <cit> . as well as providing information about population history, genes controlling morphological traits can provide direct information about the selective and cultural context of domestication. small size could have been more desirable in more densely packed agrarian societies where dogs may have lived partly indoors or in confined outdoor spaces. this study provides further evidence for the importance of a major size gene early in the evolutionary history of dogs and implicates the levant culture as an initial source and selective agent for small size in domestic dogs.
