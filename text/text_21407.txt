BACKGROUND
ca_c <dig> from clostridium acetobutylicum  is a novel 434-residue protein of unknown function. initial sequence analysis suggested that this protein could be a metallopeptidase. a psi-blast  <cit>  search against uniprot revealed that there are over  <dig> other similar proteins of unknown function. pairwise sequence identities of these proteins to ca_c <dig> vary between 40-60%. we present here the crystal structure of ca_c <dig>  determined as part of the protein structure initiative program to extend structural coverage of novel protein sequence space to provide structure-based function assignment  <cit> . ca_c <dig> was specifically targeted by the joint center for structural genomics  in an effort to increase the structural coverage of proteins in pfam  <cit>  clan cl <dig> of metallopeptidases , which has ~ <dig> protein sequences  in  <dig> families  but with only limited , biased structural coverage. the families that form this clan contain many sequences, are functionally diverse, and are important in numerous biological processes. for example, recombinant bacterial carboxypeptidase g <dig> is used in cancer therapy to hydrolyze methotrexate  <cit>  and is being tested in prodrug therapy; and human aspartoacylase is implicated in canavan’s disease in the brain  <cit> . there are also non-peptidase homologs of these proteins: some of these have active catalytic domains, but perform distinct albeit related enzymatic functions, such as the glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase. in other cases the homologous domains are not catalytically active and they perform protein-protein interaction based functions, such as the transferrin receptor proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  jcsg has determined ~ <dig> structures to date from clan cl <dig> . proteins in these families  <cit>  have a broad phylogenetic spread across all kingdoms of life and show substantial sequence divergence.

the structure of ca_c <dig> revealed that it is composed of three domains. our sequence and structure analysis led to the assignment of these three domains of ca_c <dig> and its homologs to new pfam families   <cit> , to be released in the next pfam update, version  <dig> : the n-terminal metallopeptidase-like domain to duf <dig> , which is distantly related by sequence to the peptidase_m <dig> family  in clan cl <dig> ; the insert domain to duf <dig>  ; and the c-terminal whth to hth_ <dig> . we believe that our results may aid in the design of structure-based biochemical experiments to further explore the biology of these proteins similar to other recent efforts on proteins of unknown function  <cit> . based on a recent study, many duf proteins are likely essential proteins  <cit> .

RESULTS
overall structure
the protein production and crystallization of ca_c <dig> was performed by standard protocols in the jcsg high-throughput structural biology pipeline  as briefly described in methods. the crystal structure was determined to  <dig>  Å by multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction  phasing and atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors have been deposited in the protein data bank  with pdb accession code 3k9t. data collection, model and refinement statistics are summarized in table  <dig> <cit> . there is one molecule of ca_c <dig> in the crystallographic asymmetric unit , which contains  <dig> of the  <dig> residues in the entire protein as well as gly <dig> that remains after cleavage of the protein expression and purification tag. residues 374– <dig> were disordered in the structure and were excluded from the protein model. a zinc ion  was modeled at the putative peptidase active site based on presence in the crystallization condition as well as an anomalous difference fourier map. an imidazole molecule  from the crystallization condition was also modeled based on electron density to coordinate with the zn. other solvent molecules include two chloride ions and four -2-methylpentane- <dig> -diol  molecules from the crystallization condition as well as water molecules. sequencing of the cloned construct indicated that residue pro <dig> was substituted with a serine residue, which was supported by electron density. based on crystal packing analysis, using the ‘;protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies’ service pisa   <cit>  at the european bioinformatics institute , the predicted biological assembly of ca_c <dig> is a trimer. size-exclusion chromatography coupled with static light scattering, performed during protein production and crystallization screening, also supports a protein trimer in solution. a search for other proteins that may share overall structural similarity to ca_c <dig>  using the protein structure comparison service fold at ebi   <cit>  produced no significant hits. examination of the structure revealed three distinct domains: a peptidase_m28-like metallopeptidase domain with a small α + β domain inserted into it and a c-terminal whth domain  <cit> .

n-terminal metallopeptidase-like domain 
out of the  <dig> residues in ca_c <dig>  approximately residues 1– <dig> and 165– <dig> form the metallopeptidase-like domain, forming the portion that is related to the peptidase_m <dig> family . a search for other structurally related proteins using fold produces significant hits to several aminopeptidases  ~ <dig>  Å between cα atoms over the entire domain) with pdb codes  , ,  and , all structures from the peptidase_m <dig> family. however, despite the degree of structural conservation, the level of sequence identity is very low . the putative active site includes a zn coordinated with residues asp <dig>  his <dig>  his <dig> and the n <dig> atom from the imd. it is possible that imd mimics a portion of the physiological ligand. to identify conserved residues and any potential clustering of such residues, we aligned  <dig> homologs  and used the conservation profile to mark-up the structure corresponding to duf <dig> . this sequence conservation analysis identified a cluster of conserved residues located within a cleft of the structure, which include asp <dig>  his <dig> and his <dig> that coordinate to the zn, and together form a putative active site.

all known peptidase_m <dig> members bind two zn ions, which are described as “co-catalytic” as both zn ions participate in the catalytic activity. in contrast, ca_c <dig> has one bound zn ion. in an earlier study, it was found that hmra   <cit> , a peptidase_m <dig>  protein , also contained only one zn ion and that this might have been enough to change its specificity from that of an exopeptidase  to that of an endopeptidase. despite only one zn ion in hmra , all five zn-coordinating residues expected in peptidase_m <dig> are conserved, which is not the case with ca_c <dig>  in ca_c <dig> only the residues that bind the single zn ion have been retained.

ca_c <dig> does not possess conventional peptidase_m <dig> active site residues, as both of the essential, invariant, active site residues have been replaced: ser <dig> replaces the conserved asp and pro <dig> replaces the conserved glu. ser <dig> is conserved as ser in  <dig> of the  <dig> homologs that were aligned and present as either ala or gly in the remaining  <dig> homologs. pro <dig> is conserved as pro in  <dig> of the homologs and present as val in  <dig> homolog. all enzymes in peptidase_m <dig>  the closest known peptidase family by structure and sequence, have these residues conserved. there are over  <dig> non-peptidase m <dig> homologs in merops, but only a few have been characterized. those that have been characterized have evolved different functions, for example, the transferrin receptor proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase. the glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase also has all five zn-binding and both active site asp and glu residues conserved  <cit> , therefore, ca_c <dig> is unlikely to have comparable catalytic activity. transferrin in blood serum binds iron, which is internalized once transferrin docks to its receptor  <cit> .

insert domain 
residues 56– <dig>  in ca_c <dig> form a separate globular domain inserted into the duf <dig> domain. this insert domain adopts an α+β fold that does not closely match any other known structures. however, careful visual inspection shows  that the insert domain bears a resemblance to the “protease-associated” domain  in terms of gross structure and orientation of insertion. a comparison of the ca_c <dig> structure with the structure of an aminopeptidase from aneurinibacillus sp. strain am- <dig> , suggests that its duf <dig> domain is very likely derived from the pa protein domain family . the pa domain is similarly found inserted within several other peptidase domains, which are catalytically unrelated to each other. interestingly, the pa domain is found inserted in some peptidase_m <dig> domains at a structurally equivalent site to that of duf <dig> in duf <dig>  it has been suggested that the pa domain may act as a lid, which covers the active site and may be involved in protein recognition in vacuolar sorting receptors  <cit> . the pa domain of aminopeptidase has a characteristic “swivelling” β/β/α domain fold  <cit> . in the duf <dig> domain in ca_c <dig>  there is a turn of an α-helix instead of a large β‒α‒β‒α‒β substructure on one side of the pa domain fold, whereas the remaining structures of the two domains retain overall similarity and differ only by a few minor insertion or deletions . given their equivalent location relative to the peptidase domain, we propose that the duf <dig> domain has probably evolved from the pa domain in a pre-existing multi-domain context, that is, after its merger with the catalytic domain.

to study sequence conservation in duf <dig> homologs, thereby allowing the identification of residues that may be functionally important,  <dig> sequences ranging in identity from 47-66% were aligned and the conservation profile used to mark-up the structure corresponding to duf <dig> . numerous aromatic amino acid residues appear to be the most conserved in this domain: trp <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  speculatively, these residues might be important in binding to target proteins if, like the pa domain, this domain is involved in protein recognition.

c-terminal whth domain 
one of the most interesting aspects of ca_c <dig> and its homologs is the presence of a unique c-terminal circularly permuted whth domain in conjunction with the metallopeptidase domain. a search for other proteins using fold that are similar to this domain  results in very significant hits  with other whth domains, although the sequence identities of these hits are in the 15-19% range . a jackhmmer  <cit>  search using default search parameters identifies matches on the third iteration to sequences corresponding to the position of marr_ <dig>  transcription factors. structures of sequences belonging to marr_ <dig> also adopt a whth topology, supporting the structure-based search at the sequence level, but clearly show that this whth has diverged in terms of sequence from other known whth domains. to identify residues that may be functionally important based on sequence conservation,  <dig> homologs ranging in sequence identity from 36%-79% were used, out of which only one sequence had higher than 53% sequence identity . this revealed that residues with the highest conservation are surface exposed in this domain, suggesting that their role may be in surface-mediated contacts.

the juxtaposition of a metallopeptidase with a whth domain is not common, although a similar domain architecture has been observed previously in methionine aminopeptidase- <dig> . the whth domain in met-ap <dig> is inserted within a distinct peptidase domain belonging to the peptidase_m <dig> family , which includes the creatinases and prolidases. in met-ap <dig>  the inserted whth domain has been shown to be important for the recognition and specificity of the substrate, namely, the amino-termini of proteins processed by the enzyme  <cit>  . interestingly, comparison of the ca_c <dig> and met-ap <dig> whth domains indicates that they have a similar permutation of the whth domain . furthermore, as in the case in the met-ap <dig>  the ca_c <dig> whth domain is spatially located as a distinct module, which points away from the core catalytic domain. thus, by analogy to the met-ap <dig>  we propose that the permuted whth might serve in a similar capacity in substrate recognition and specificity in ca_c <dig> and its homologs. in a more general sense, the recognition of circularly permuted domains independently fused to two distinct classes of peptidases raises the possibility that these domains may have been more generally recruited as potential peptide-recognition modules early in the history of proteins.

oligomeric assembly
as mentioned above, crystal packing analysis predicts a trimer as the oligomeric form in solution, which is supported by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with static light scattering. the trimeric assembly is formed by the interaction of residues in the whth domain  with loop residues 62– <dig> in the insert domain and loop residues 302– <dig> and 293– <dig> in the metallopeptidase-like domain. some of these residues forming the assembly in all  <dig> domains show high conservation, indicating that these are likely to be the key binding residues in the protein interaction interface. in particular, a substantial portion of the surface on one side of the whth appears to be responsible for mediating the monomer protein interactions in the oligomeric state, covering the majority of the highly conserved residues. these observations strongly suggest that the whth functions in mediating protein interactions in the oligomeric state.

conserved gene neighborhoods point to a potential role in modified carbohydrate biosynthesis
as described above, the sequence and structural analysis indicates that the conserved residue pattern does not conform to any known peptidase active site. therefore, to better understand the possible biochemical function of ca_c <dig>  we used contextual information gleaned from conserved gene neighborhoods. several studies have shown that genome context or conserved gene-neighborhoods provide information in terms of functionally interacting partners or complexes to which particular proteins belong  <cit> . interestingly, we found a strong gene-neighborhood association  between ca_c <dig> and its homologs with several genes involved in biosynthesis of a modified carbohydrate across several phylogenetically distinct bacterial taxa, namely actinobacteria, firmicutes, cyanobacteria, bacteroidetes, planctomycetes . this wide phyletic spread of the association suggests that the co-occurrence is likely to be of functional importance for these enzymes. among the strongly linked genes we found those coding for a sugar epimerase/dehydratase, a sugar phosphate nucleotidyltransferase, a glycosyl transferase, an aminosugar n-acetyltransferase and a sam-dependent sugar methylase. these enzymes are all associated with carbohydrate metabolism, and are indicative that a modified sugar is being synthesized by the action of multiple enzymes and converted to a nucleotide diphosphate linked sugar by the action of the nucleotidyltransferase. this ndp-sugar then probably serves as the substrate for the glycosyltransferase that transfers it to a target moiety. however, examination of the predicted operons also reveals variability especially in terms of the numbers of genes encoding for glycosyltransferases, sugar methylases and other auxiliary modifying enzymes such as those that act on sugars to add acyl groups .

this linkage between a gene coding for a peptidase-like protein with a carbohydrate biosynthetic system could be explained in at least three alternative ways: 1) ca_c <dig> protein and its homologs are post-translationally glycosylated; 2) the duf <dig> domain cleaves target proteins alongside their modification by glycosylation; 3) the duf <dig> domain actually participates in the biosynthesis of a sugar-derived metabolite by catalyzing a reaction biochemically distinct from the classical peptidase reaction. circumstantial evidence supports the third alternative. first, as discussed above, the ca_c2195-like genes do not seem to preserve the conventional metallopeptidase active site. moreover, these genes are usually embedded in the middle of an operon with genes for carbohydrate-modifying enzymes on either side. second, these operons do not show any linked genes coding for other potential target proteins. third, in several cases these operons contain genes for a transmembrane carbohydrate export protein  and transmembrane sugar pyruvyltransferase . these proteins suggest that the modified carbohydrate is unlikely to be used to modify intracellular proteins; rather it is likely to be translocated to the cell-surface and used as part of a surface polysaccharide/lipopolysaccharide. in light of these observations it is possible that duf <dig> is involved in modification of the sugar-derived metabolites, perhaps via transacylation of a peptide/glutamine to an amino sugar. in principle, they could also be used in an amidase reaction for deacylation of a sugar amide, but this would imply that they utilize distinctive active site residues . tmpred  predicts one significant transmembrane helix in ca_c <dig> , which is buried in the metallopeptidase-like domain , and phobius  <cit>  predicts most of the protein to be extracellular, with a dip where the possible transmembrane helix might be. signalp  <cit>  fails to predict a signal peptide and so it is unknown how this protein gets into the periplasm or if it is extracellular.

CONCLUSIONS
the crystal structure of ca_c <dig> and subsequent sequence-structure-function analysis shows that ca_c <dig>  is a three-domain protein, which includes a c-terminal whth domain and a duf <dig> domain inserted in the duf <dig> metallopeptidase-like domain. the presence of the pa domain-like duf <dig> domain shows similarity in domain architecture to some members of the peptidase_m <dig> family . however, the presences of a c-terminal whth domain in ca_c <dig>  shows similarity to domain architectures found in peptidase_m <dig> . analysis of sequence conservation reveals a cluster of non-sequential, highly conserved residues on the surface of the structure of ca_c <dig>  which are likely to be functionally important, some of which in the whth are involved in forming the protein interaction interface in the oligomeric form. it is possible that these proteins do not have any metallopeptidase activity because of the absence of all the catalytic residues that are expected from other characterized members of this peptidase clan. based on gene neighborhood analysis, we propose that ca_c <dig> and its homologs could be involved in the biosynthesis of modified carbohydrates. given the importance of cell surface polysaccharides in inter-organismal interactions, further characterization of the biochemical activity of this protein is likely to be of interest in the case of pathogens that encode a ca_c <dig> like gene, such as brucella and campylobacter.
