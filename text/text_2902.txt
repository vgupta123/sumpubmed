BACKGROUND
topoisomerase  ii alpha  is a nuclear protein which regulates dna architecture during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . studies in xenopus have shown that its function in chromatin condensation is tightly coupled to prior dna replication  <cit> . the expression of top2a is cell cycle regulated, reaching a peak in the g2/m phase  <cit> . thus, up-regulated levels of top2a protein are found in proliferating cancer cells, and top2a is essential for the viability of these dividing cells. consistent with its role in cell proliferation, genetic aberrations in top2a are linked to numerous human cancers  <cit> . to facilitate proper separation of chromatids and dna replication, top2a generates transient double-stranded breaks in dna  <cit> . pharmacological targeting of top2a, which is extensively applied in cancer treatment, exploits this mechanism  <cit> .

vertebrate genomes contain two topoisomerases ii paralogues. human top2a and top2b have similar molecular masses  and share ~70% amino acid similarity, with the greatest divergence occurring in the c-terminal domain  <cit> . despite structural similarities, these topoisomerases ii isoforms have different expression patterns and functions  <cit> . in contrast to the expression of mammalian top2a which peaks at g2/m, mammalian top2b is expressed in differentiated tissues and its expression is not cell cycle regulated  <cit> . several in vitro models have been utilised to study the loss-of-function effects associated with topoisomerase ii genes. however, the critical role of top2a genes for cell proliferation and survival necessitates conditional knockout models  <cit> . in vivo, genetic elimination of top2a is dramatic, with mouse knockouts not developing beyond the 4- <dig> cell stage  <cit> . underlying a distinct role, top2b knockouts are not embryonic lethal. instead top2b is required during neuronal differentiation, for survival of some neural cells and neurite outgrowth  <cit> . top2b null mice have defects in cerebral stratification and motor axons fail to contact skeletal muscles resulting in death soon after birth due to breathing impairment  <cit> . the topoisomerases ii paralogues are also important as targets of anti-cancer drugs. icrf- <dig>  a catalytic inhibitor, blocks topoisomerase ii-mediated atp hydrolysis which is required to regenerate its active enzymatic form  <cit> . etoposide, a topoisomerase ii poison, inhibits the ability of topoisomerase ii to re-ligate dna molecules and therefore stabilises cleavable complexes of the enzyme leading to extensive fragmentation of dna and cell death  <cit> . topoisomerase ii poisons are reported to mediate their cytotoxic effects through top2a, while double strand breaks and dna rearrangements associated with secondary malignancies are due to top2b  <cit> .

two top2a mutant alleles have previously been documented in zebrafish: hi <dig> generated by viral insertion  <cit>  and can <dig> by enu mutagenesis  <cit> . these mutants present with similar phenotypes including brain necrosis, abnormal tail curvature and death at 4- <dig> dpf. the can <dig> mutants have been studied more thoroughly and display reduced cell proliferation, mitotic spindle defects and increased dna content. recently, a zebrafish top2b mutant was reported with a phenotype distinct to top2a mutants, including defects in neurite targeting within the retinal inner plexiform layer and tectal neuropil  <cit> . these distinct phenotypes indicate separate functions of the zebrafish top2a and top2b isoforms.

previous studies, however, do not explain the viability of zebrafish top2a mutants up to larval stages, in contrast to the early embryonic lethality of mouse top2a knockouts. one explanation could relate to differential requirements of teleost and mammalian embryos for the timing of initiation of zygotic transcription, i.e. transcription from the embryo's own genome. the mid-blastula transition  refers to the moment during the blastula stage of embryonic development when expression of the zygotic genome starts, cell cycles lengthen, and cells acquire the ability to migrate  <cit> . the original term mbt  was expanded to include a phase of elimination of maternal transcripts and proteins starting before the activation of zygotic transcription  <cit> . this developmental event is referred as maternal-to-zygotic-transition  in recent studies  <cit> . in zebrafish, zygotic transcription increases gradually from the 10th  to 13th cycle   <cit> .

here, we describe a novel zebrafish top2a mutant named "bloody minded"  which was identified in an enu mutagenesis screen. mutant larvae can survive to ~ <dig> dpf, although abnormal embryo morphology is discernable at ~ <dig> hpf. we tested the hypotheses that the advanced development of zebrafish top2a mutants is due to either the presence of maternal top2a or redundancy with the top2b isoform. our results are consistent with early embryonic development depending on maternal transcripts of zebrafish top2a. the absence of zygotic top2a is not fully compensated for by maternal, zygotic or ectopic top2b mrna suggesting distinct functions of top2a and top2b in embryonic development.

RESULTS
blm is a lethal recessive zebrafish mutant
during f <dig> mutagenesis screens we recovered a recessive-lethal mutant named bloody-minded . the blm phenotype is first visible at ~ <dig> hpf when forebrain and midbrain atrophy is apparent and occasionally accompanied with cns haemorrhage . increased cell death is prominent in the blm head, retina and lens at ~ <dig> hpf . the eyes fail to develop further so that at 2- <dig> dpf, blm eyes are significantly smaller than wildtype siblings and blm lenses protrude from the eye. at this stage, blm retinae fail to properly laminate and dying cells are visible. the body axes of blm mutants curves dorsally, cardiac oedema develops and blm mutants die at 4- <dig> dpf.

blm arises from a nonsense mutation in the top2a gene
to determine the genetic locus of the blm mutation we performed bulk segregant analysis. linkage to the blm phenotype was found on chromosome  <dig> with flanking z-markers z <dig> and z <dig> . several new simple sequence repeat  markers were designed to narrow the critical interval of which zc13b10-ssr <dig> was most closely linked . analyses of the genetic maps in this interval revealed that a viral insertion mutant hi <dig>  with gross morphology similar to blm, co-segregated with the blm interval  <cit> . as hi <dig> arises from an insertion in exon  <dig> of the gene encoding topoisomerase iia , we chose top2a as a candidate gene for blm. sequencing of whole larval cdna from blm mutants reveals a point mutation  which introduces a premature stop codon at lys residue  <dig>  . the resulting truncated protein lacks the enzymatic domain .

to confirm that the blm phenotype arises from a mutation in the top2a gene we performed complementation assays . matings of blm carriers and hi <dig> carriers fail to complement. matings of blm+/- with hi3635+/- generated ~30% embryos with the blm phenotype, whereas outcrosses to wildtype fish did not. thus, genomic and genetic data confirm that the blm mutant results from a nonsense mutation in the zebrafish top2a gene.

top2a mutants exhibit defects in cell cycle progression
topoisomerase ii alpha genes are known to be critical for cell cycle progression. therefore, we quantified, by flow cytometry, the distribution of blm cells within the major phases of the cell cycle. at  <dig> hpf, the proportion of dissociated blm cells in the g2/m phase  is approximately double that of wildtype siblings  consistent with defects in mitosis . by immunohistochemistry, the total number of cells in the blm eye that express the g2/m marker phospho-histone h <dig> is lower than wildtype siblings . however, consistent with the flow cytometry analyses , the proportion of cells expressing the g2/m marker, normalized to the total number of nuclei, is significantly higher in blm mutants  than in wildtype siblings  . at the transcript level, no significant difference is observed at  <dig> hpf for p21-like or ccnb <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> phase markers respectively, in blm mutants compared to siblings . equivalent levels of the post-mitotic retinal marker atoh <dig> were observed in blm and siblings indicating that retinogenesis had initiated in blm mutants . with regards to cell death, a higher degree of apoptosis was observed in blm mutants at  <dig> hpf . in summary, blm mutants exhibit an increased proportion of cells in g2/m phase, consistent with delayed cell cycle progression.

maternal top2a but not top2b is expressed pre-mzt
the fact that cell cycle progression is occurring in blm larvae contrasts dramatically with the essential requirement of top2a for mammalian embryo development beyond the 4- <dig> cell stage. therefore, we hypothesised that top2a-/- cells can proliferate in zebrafish blm mutants due to the presence of maternal top2a or functional redundancy with its top2b paralogue. the amino acid sequences of the zebrafish paralogues are 65% identical with the greatest divergence at the c-terminal end . rt-pcr of rna extracted from pre-  and post-mzt  wildtype embryos demonstrates that maternal top2a transcript is abundant pre-mzt, whereas top2b transcript is not significantly expressed until after the onset of zygotic transcription . quantitative analysis by real-time pcr confirms these results .

real-time pcr also demonstrates a reduced level of top2a transcript in blm embryos compared to wildtype siblings at 1- <dig> dpf . zebrafish top2b transcript is negligible before  <dig> hpf, but is abundantly expressed at  <dig> hpf, a stage after mzt and before blm phenotypes are detected . at  <dig> hpf, top2b levels are similar in blm mutants and widtype siblings. in siblings, top2b levels remain high at  <dig> dpf. in contrast, top2b levels decrease by ~50% in blm mutants by  <dig> dpf, consistent with the morphological defects observed at this developmental stage. in summary, maternal top2a could account for the extended pre- and/or post-mzt development of blm mutants whereas zygotic top2b could only account for the extended post-mzt development.

no evidence of functional redundancy between top2a and top2b in vivo
rt-pcr analyses confirm that top2a and top2b are co-expressed in the eye at 2- <dig> dpf . wholemount in-situ hybridisation in  <dig> hpf wildtype larvae reveals predominant zygotic expression of top2b in the forebrain and eyes, organs that display severe morphological abnormalities from  <dig> hpf in blm mutants . at  <dig> dpf, top2b is expressed in the forebrain, midbrain, branchial arches and eyes . t-pcr confirms that top2b is expressed in the blm eyes and body at  <dig> dpf . although the size of the eyes and head is reduced, the spatial expression of top2b in blm mutants at  <dig> dpf is not affected . overall, this suggests that top2b has biological potential to rescue affected tissues in blm mutants but cannot do so due to functional divergences between the top2a and top2b paralogues. in agreement, ectopic expression of top2b mrna in blm mutants shows no evidence of rescuing the blm phenotype . larvae overexpressing top2b by ~ <dig>  fold still exhibit the blm phenotype . morphologically, the average eye diameter of blm larvae overexpressing top2b is not significantly different from uninjected blm larvae . thus, overexpression of top2b in blm larvae at non-toxic levels shows no evidence of rescuing the blm phenotype. in summary, our data suggests that top2a and top2b are not functionally redundant during embryo development.

chemical inhibition of top2a delays development of pre-mzt embryos
to evaluate if maternal topoisomerase ii proteins present in zebrafish embryos are required for early development, we chemically inhibited their function. icrf- <dig> is a chemical inhibitor of top2a and top2b. with the goal of targeting the drug to maternal top2a, and avoiding effects on zygotic top2b, 1- <dig> cell stage embryos from matings of blm carriers were treated with icrf- <dig> for ~ <dig>  hours, the drug removed before mzt and the embryos allowed to develop to  <dig> hpf. no discernible morphological defects were observed in icrf- <dig> treated embryos compared to controls . in replicate experiments, the cell cycle profile of treated embryos was analysed at  <dig> hpf . compared to their dmso-treated controls, transient inhibition does not dramatically affect the percentage of sibling- or blm-treated cells in g0/g <dig>  s, g2/m or polyploid categories . a slight increase in the subg <dig> population of treated embryos is observed. thus, transient treatment of pre-mzt embryos with a topoisomerase inhibitor causes no obvious morphological or cell cycle defects at a later developmental stage.

in an alternative approach , focusing specifically on earlier cell divisions, zebrafish embryos at the 1- <dig> cell stage were treated for ~ <dig>  hours with a topoisomerase ii inhibitor  or poison  and their developmental progression quantified according to established developmental staging series . in embryo medium alone or in the presence of a drug not targeting topoisomerase ii , ~60-70% of embryos are staged at  <dig> cells . in vehicle-treated controls , performed concurrently with siblings, embryos are distributed equivalently across the 8-32+ cell stages . in contrast, in icrf- <dig> and etoposide-treated siblings there is an altered distribution peaking in the 8- <dig> cell stages . these differences are statistically significant  when compared to dmso controls .  <dig> mm icrf- <dig> demonstrates a ~26% increase in the numbers of embryos ≤  <dig> cell stage, and up to a ~35% reduction in the number of embryos >  <dig> cell stage . the reduced number of cell divisions in over one quarter of the population is significant, considering the short treatment duration, the necessity for the drugs to penetrate the chorion, and the very high concentration of top2a in zebrafish embryos ,  <cit> . in summary, we conclude that maternal top2a is required for the normal rate of embryonic cell division in developing zebrafish.

inhibition of xenopus top2a results in an extended m-phase in cycling extracts
to further analyze the effect of top2a inhibition on pre-mzt cell cycle progression we utilized cycling extracts prepared from activated xenopus laevis eggs. these extracts recapitulate, in vitro, the cell cycle of the intact fertilized egg, with extracts oscillating between s phase and mitosis as in pre-mbt embryos  <cit> . in control extracts the first mitotic peak of phosphohistone h <dig> expression was observed after  <dig> minutes, with a subsequent mitotic peak observed at  <dig> minutes, thus recapitulating the  <dig> minute cycling interval observed in whole embryos . addition of icrf- <dig> to extracts at time  <dig> resulted in a much longer m phase compared to control extracts . results from two different cycling extracts indicate a ~40% lengthened m phase following topoisomerase ii inhibition . additionally, there was no evidence of a subsequent mitotic cycle in the following  <dig> minutes. in summary, we conclude that inhibiting maternal top2a with icrf- <dig> delays early embryonic cell cycle progression in m phase and may interfere with subsequent s phase entry.

discussion
top2a mutagenic susceptibility
vertebrate topoisomerase ii alpha genes appear particularly susceptible to somatic and germline mutations. amplifications of the human top2a locus is associated with somatic mutations in subsets of breast, bladder and gastric cancers  <cit> . notably, three genetically-distinct zebrafish top2a mutant alleles have now been uncovered  in independent mutagenesis screens, suggesting that the top2a locus is also particularly susceptible to germline dna perturbations  <cit> . all zebrafish top2a mutants display equivalent gross morphological phenotypes: small eye and brain, cns necrosis, abnormal tail curvature and death at 4- <dig> dpf. although, no further characterisation of the hi <dig> insertion mutant has been reported, can <dig> and blm top2a-/- alleles display similar cell cycle defects, including accumulation of mutant cells in g2/m and altered phosphohistone h <dig> expression ,  <cit> .

the blm phenotype
our interpretation of the blm mutant phenotype is as follows . a nonsense mutation in the zebrafish top2a gene results in the expression of non-functional top2a protein post mzt in blm mutants. the lower rna expression levels may be due to lower transcription or increased decay of mutant top2a mrna. the extensive embryonic and larval development of blm mutants arises from maternal expression of top2a, and not top2b which is negligible pre-mzt. depletion of the maternal top2a transcript and top2a protein results in the morphological phenotype of blm mutants at  <dig> hpf. intracellular levels of top2a/top2a diminish as daughter cells divide and as mrna/protein degrades. for example, after only  <dig> divisions the level of top2a per daughter cell is expected to deplete by >  <dig> fold relative to dna content. thus, tissues that are actively proliferating in later stages of development  are preferentially affected. in those cells, top2a depletion would likely perturb dna decatenation during replication resulting in genomic instability and cell cycle checkpoint activation. the augmented levels of g2/m and apoptotic cells observed in blm mutants at ~ <dig> hpf are consistent with activation of the known g2/m decatenation checkpoint present in adult cells leading to apoptosis.

overall our data lead us to conclusion that zebrafish top2a and top2b are not functionally redundant in vivo. the zebrafish paralogs are ~65% identical at the protein level; both containing n-terminal atp-binding sites and a central domain tyrosine required for dna cleavage and ligation . only the c-terminal domains, containing nuclear localization sequences and phosphorylation sites, are highly divergent  <cit> . previous studies in human cell lines suggested that top2b can compensate for depleted top2a  <cit> . in contrast, abundant zebrafish top2b transcript at stages post-mzt is not sufficient to prevent the blm phenotype, despite extensive temporal expression in tissues that develop morphological abnormalities in blm mutants. the onset of the blm phenotype correlates with depletion of maternal top2a, at a stage when zygotic top2b is abundant, and we identify embryos overexpressing ectopic top2b that retain the blm phenotype. furthermore, in contrast to top2a mutants, the recently described top2b mutant displays a distinct phenotype in post-mitotic cells and not in proliferating cells  <cit> . there is a potential compensatory role for maternal top2b in pre-mzt stages that we cannot directly exclude. however, pre-mzt top2b expression is negligible  <cit>  and we have not found evidence of maternal deposition of top2b in the literature. notably, the functional divergence we observe in vivo between zebrafish top2a and top2b is in agreement with other in vitro studies reporting that the unique cell cycle functions of the top2a isoform are dependent on specific c-terminal sequences  <cit> . overall, our in vivo studies support that top2a and top2b do not exhibit complete functional redundancy during zebrafish embryo development.

role of maternal top2a pre-mzt
previous genetic approaches to analyse maternal top2a function using morpholino knockdowns have proven unsuccessful, probably because of the abundance of top2a/top2a  <cit> . therefore, to confirm that maternal top2a enables pre-mzt development, we pharmacologically targeted maternal top2a protein using icrf- <dig>  a topoisomerase ii catalytic inhibitor and etoposide, a topoisomerase ii poison  <cit> .

our data supports the conclusion that maternal top2a is needed for the normal progression of pre-mzt embryos through developmental divisions. both icrf- <dig> and etoposide delay the progression of embryos through hierarchical developmental stages. this delay is reversible as washing out the drug results in the vast majority of zebrafish embryos proceeding beyond the  <dig> hpf, segmentation stage. it is likely that we are only partially inhibiting top2a protein as complete inhibition is expected to arrest development earlier.

to explore the mechanism underlying the impaired developmental cell divisions in icrf- <dig> treated embryos we utilised xenopus cycling extracts which recapitulate in vitro the cell cycle of pre-mbt embryos  <cit> . only topoisomerase ii α is expressed in xenopus eggs and embryos as demonstrated by the fact that depletion of top2a from egg extracts abolishes topoisomerase ii activity  <cit> . our molecular analysis of xenopus extracts treated with icrf- <dig> indicates a lengthening of m phase. this is consistent with the previous morphological studies that observed anaphase stalling of pre-mzt zebrafish treated with etoposide  <cit> .

we propose that the mechanism underlying delayed pre-mzt development and m phase lengthening following top <dig> inhibition reflects activation of a cell cycle decatenation checkpoint. in the pre-mzt embryos lacking gap phases, top2a inhibition results in a stoichiometric decrease in dna decatenation during cell division activating a dna decatenation checkpoint  <cit> . the m phase lengthening observed in icrf- <dig> treated cycling extracts are consistent with defects in chromosome condensation and segregation most likely slowing the cycle and possibly activating a checkpoint in mitosis.

inhibition of top2a could be impacting on one or more phases of the cell division cycle and its effects in the simple early embryonic cell cycle and later somatic cycles where gap phases are present may be the result of different cell cycle processes being impeded. icrf- <dig> is known to activate a g <dig> decatenation checkpoint in adult cells  <cit> . interestingly, top2a, but not top2b, is required for activation of the decatenation checkpoint  <cit> . catalytically inhibited top2a exposes a c-terminal phospho-serine that recruits mdc <dig> to chromatin and activates the decatenation checkpoint  <cit> . as shown by our data, etoposide, which induces dna damage in adult cells, phenocopies icrf- <dig> in pre-mzt embryos. the likely explanation is the absence of top2b and the absence of a dna damage checkpoint in pre-mzt embryos  <cit> . this also suggests that etoposide alters top2a topology to activate the decatenation checkpoint. in summary, we propose that inhibition of maternal top2a activates a dna decatenation checkpoint that delays mitosis and results in delayed embryonic development.

phenotypic differences between mouse and zebrafish top2a mutants
why does maternal top2a enable zebrafish top2a-/- mutants to progress to stages comprising of hundreds of thousands of cells, whilst mouse top2a-/- knockouts fail to divide beyond the 4- <dig> cell stage? one possibility is that maternal top2a is not expressed in mammalian embryos. this is not the case, as studies show that catalytically active top2a is functional at the 1-cell stage in mouse embryos  <cit> . alternatively, maternal topoisomerase ii alpha may have differential stability in mice and zebrafish due to the timing of mzt which occurs between embryonic day  <dig>  and  <dig>   in mouse but between  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours after fertilization  in zebrafish  <cit> . although some maternal transcripts are still present in embryonic day  <dig>  murine morulas  <cit> , previous reports demonstrate that newly synthesised mouse top2a at the 2-cell stage is essential for cell cycle progression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the ability of zebrafish top2a-/- mutants to proceed through thousands of developmental cell divisions starkly contrasts with mammalian top2a-/- knockouts which fail to divide beyond the 4- <dig> cell stage  <cit> . our analyses reveal that pre-mzt, maternal top2a is sufficient to enable zebrafish top2a-/- mutants to progress through early development. post-mzt, zebrafish top2b expression is insufficient to fully compensate for the absence of top2a in vivo and blm mutants die at ~ <dig> dpf . top2a inhibition or loss results in clear cell cycle defects in early embryonic cell cycles of both zebrafish and xenopus, as well as in later somatic cell cycles where blm mutants show evidence of g2/m decatenation checkpoint activation.
