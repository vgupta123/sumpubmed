BACKGROUND
the maintenance of skin as a barrier that protects the host from the external environment requires a vigilant state in order to respond immediately to external, often unexpected, insults. following injury, skin can heal by regenerative  or reparative  processes. regenerative skin healing, so common among lower vertebrates , is almost absent in adult mammals. in  <dig>  rowlatt reported in his seminal paper that human fetuses are capable of regenerative  response to skin wounds  <cit> . follow-up studies showed that mammalian fetuses heal skin injuries in a scar-free way, if the injury occurs during first two trimesters of gestation. thereafter, skin lesions heal with scar formation . the transition from scarless, fetal-type repair to adult-type repair with scarring occurs between days  <dig>  and  <dig>  of gestation for mice and rats  <cit>  and 24 weeks for humans  <cit> . comprehensive studies on regeneration in fetal skin have uncovered important differences between fetal and adult skin and identified factors that are prerequisites for scar-free healing; however, key pathways responsible for regenerative healing remain to be determined  <cit> .

recently, our laboratory introduced a genetic mouse model to determine the underlying mechanisms of scar-free healing by showing that adult nude  mice, similar to mammalian fetuses, are able to heal their skin injuries in a scar-free way . to explore the possible mechanisms of skin regeneration, mouse models with variable immune-competency were examined to assess whether the immunodeficiency of nude mice involving the lack of thymus or t-lymphocytes could explain scar-free skin healing  <cit> . although the results of the studies do not challenge the contribution of inflammatory response in the outcome of skin wound healing, they showed that the lack of thymus and/or t-cells was not a condition for scarless healing  <cit> .

the nude phenotype is the consequence of a spontaneous point mutation in the forkhead box n <dig>  gene which encodes a transcriptional factor expressed in epithelial cells of the thymus, a distinct population of keratinocytes in the epidermis, and hair follicles. the pleiotropic effects of the foxn <dig> mutation are manifested by a lack of thymus, primary t-cell deficiency and hairless skin in mice, rats and humans. studies on the role of foxn <dig> in skin and hair development, although not as extensive as on the thymus, indicate that foxn <dig> participates in hair follicle development, promotes keratinocyte differentiation and stimulates signal transduction between melanocytes and keratinocytes participating in the pigmentation process. developmental studies by brissette et al. showed that in the skin, foxn <dig> expression begins around the mouth and nose area at day  <dig>  then spreads over the entire skin by days 16– <dig> of embryonic development in mice  <cit> . this pattern of expression coincides with the transition from scar-free to scar-forming skin healing in mouse fetuses at day  <dig> of gestation. it is conceivable that a loss-of-function mutation in foxn <dig> in nude mice and the lack of normal foxn <dig> expression during the scar-free healing phase in mammalian fetuses provide conditions favorable to regeneration. moreover, our recent data revealed that foxn <dig> can act as a regulator of the skin wound healing process. the experiments performed on foxn1::egfp transgenic mice showed that foxn1-bearing cells participate in the wound healing process through engagement in re-epithelialization and possible involvement in scar formation due to foxn <dig> activity during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition   <cit> . in the present study using next-generation high-throughput dna sequencing techniques, we aimed to test the hypothesis that foxn <dig> expression in the skin is an essential condition for establishing the adult skin phenotype and that a lack of foxn <dig> maintains skin in a neoteny stage . we predict that foxn1- null mice  are neotenic in the transcriptomic signature of their skin.

RESULTS
in the present study, we have used two unique models of true regeneration among mammals, mouse fetuses at the 14th day of embryonic development  and nude mice, and genome-wide analysis of gene expression to uncover the transcriptional signature of scar-free skin healing. we hypothesize that uninjured skin of e <dig> fetuses and nude mice share a transcriptomic signature that predisposes them to regenerative skin healing when wounding occurs. in order to establish gene expression profiles in nude and e <dig> mice, we performed rna-seq analysis of uninjured skin and epidermis from 6-week old c57bl/6j  and b <dig> cg-foxn <dig> nu , and skin from b <dig> fetuses at e <dig> and e <dig> day of embryonic development. to exclude differences that can arise from different genetic backgrounds, we used mice on c57bl/6j genetic background. previous microarray studies, including a comparison of gene expression between cultured dermal fibroblasts isolated from e <dig>  and e <dig>  fetuses and cultured keratinocytes transfected with foxn <dig>  provided important insight into regenerative response genes  <cit> . however, the obtained results are highly influenced by culture conditions and the manipulation of foxn <dig> transfection  <cit> . in contrast to previous studies, we performed the analysis on intact skin to avoid in vitro culture artifacts. we are aware that our analyses are complicated due to the mixture of cellular skin components, such as keratinocytes, melanocytes, and langerhans cells in the epidermis and dermal fibroblasts; endothelial cells; preadipocytes/adipocytes; and inflammatory cells in the dermis, among others. nevertheless, wound healing is undoubtedly a process that involves multiple cell types interacting.

differential gene expression in skin and epidermis among: nude, b <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> mice
in the first step of analysis, we compared the transcriptomes from the skin of nude mice  to transcriptomes from both adult b <dig>  and e <dig>  mice. subsequently, the transcriptomes from e <dig>  skin samples were compared with transcriptomes from both e <dig>  and adult b <dig>  skin .fig.  <dig> comparison of the numbers of genes differentially regulated in skin  and epidermis . genes that are up- and down-regulated in common for nude and e <dig> . b <dig> , nude , e <dig>  and e <dig> . numbers next to arrows specify the number of genes that are differentially expressed . length of arrows indicates the relative abundance of differently regulated genes between groups  and . the analysis was performed as an overlay of gene lists from two tested sets of genes: nude vs b <dig> and e <dig> vs e <dig> 




in this manner, we generated lists of genes showing statistically significant differences in expression .

for further analysis we used genes considered as a differentially expressed when changes in the expression were greater than or equal to two-fold. the comparison of skin gene expression between nude  and b <dig>  showed  <dig> genes that were variably expressed  . similarly,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated  in the comparison between the skin from e <dig>  and e <dig>  fetuses . these numbers clearly demonstrate huge differences in gene expression between regenerative  vs reparative  models of healing. in contrast to these data, the diversity in the number of differentially expressed genes between mice displaying similar characteristics of healing is smaller. the expression profile of e <dig> fetuses shows much higher similarity to the profile of adult 6 week-old b <dig> mice; as only  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed . interestingly, the number of differentially expressed genes in adult nude vs e <dig> fetuses  is considerably lower than the number of genes that differed between adult nude  vs adult b <dig>   .

the nude phenotype results from the inactivity of transcription factor foxn <dig> whose expression in the skin is restricted to epidermis. therefore, we performed further analysis to identify the differentially regulated genes in the epidermis isolated from nude and b <dig> skin . the comparison revealed that  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes were up-regulated 2-fold and higher in nude epidermis. such a substantial number of differentially regulated genes that are potent direct and indirect targets of foxn <dig> suggests that this transcription factor broadly influences epidermis at the molecular and consequently physiological levels.

since a number of differentially regulated genes in the first analysis  may be partially due to the induction and repression of genes associated with developmental processes for e <dig>  in the next step we sought to identify genes that are similarly regulated for nude and e <dig> mice . for this purpose we compared data from two analyses: nude vs b <dig>  to e <dig> vs e <dig> . we found that among the up-regulated genes in nude vs b <dig>  and e <dig> vs e <dig> ,  <dig> are common for nude and e <dig> . the analysis showed that among  <dig> genes down-regulated for nude vs b <dig> and  <dig> for e <dig> vs e <dig>   <dig> genes were common for nude and e <dig> . the greater number of down-regulated vs up-regulated genes in regenerative skin tissues supports the concept proposed by mercer et al. that the large number of down-regulated genes suggests that the loss of their activity plays significant roles in induction and maintenance of regeneration  <cit> .

functional annotation terms grouped according to their biological meaning enriched in nude and e <dig> skin and nude epidermis
in the next step of the analysis, we focused on the list of differentially expressed genes shared between nude and e <dig> mice . genes associated with tissue remodeling, cytoskeletal rearrangements, wound healing and the immune response showed up-regulation in nude and e <dig> skin tissues, while those related to differentiation were down-regulated . similar gene categories associated with matched molecular and cellular functions have been suggested to influence the outcome of injury in other models of regeneration: lower vertebrates  <cit>  and the mrl mouse  <cit> .table  <dig> selected genes enriched in differentially expressed transcripts nude and e <dig> skin and relevant functional categories. for epidermis the analysis relays on the comparison of genes differently regulated between nude and b6

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



among the most commonly up-regulated genes that were involved in tissue remodeling and extracellular matrix composition in common for nude and e <dig> are kallikreins and kallikrein-related peptidases including klk <dig>  klk <dig> and klk <dig> and protease serine  <dig>  . it has been suggested that klk <dig> stimulates keratinocyte proliferation or differentiation depending on the stage of wound healing and its up-regulation in nude mouse skin was previously detected  <cit> . li et al. observed that prss <dig>  which is also up-regulated in nude and e <dig> according to our analysis , was found in skin only during epidermal hyperproliferation associated with wound closure  <cit> . they suggested that prss <dig> function is associated with re-epithelialization and terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. it is reported that prss <dig> and foxn <dig> are localized to the suprabasal layer of the epidermis  <cit> . considering that foxn <dig> acts as a transcriptional activator and it is responsible for the initial stages of differentiation in keratinocytes, the upregulation of prss <dig> in the nude skin seems to be an indirect consequence of foxn <dig> deficiency  <cit> .

a number of extracellular factors and stimuli  alter cell behaviors that are mirrored by changes in keratinocyte cytoskeleton and the architecture of the epidermis. e <dig> and nude mice exhibit prominent up-regulation of keratin  genes  in the skin and krt6a and -6b in nude epidermis . krt <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are biomarkers of keratinocytes in an activated  state  <cit> . interestingly, elevated levels of krt6a, - 6b and - <dig> were also detected in uninjured digital tips of the mrl mouse, the strain which displays features of enhanced regenerative abilities  <cit> . moreover, mouse embryos and post-injured skin of acomys  mice exhibit elevated levels of keratins transcripts   <cit> .

as keratinocytes switch from proliferation to differentiation, they begin to synthesize cornified envelope protein precursors  <cit> . involucrin , filaggrin , small proline-rich protein 2d  and repetin  belong to this class of peptides and all are significantly up-regulated in e <dig>  and nude  tissues . it was showed that over-expression of foxn <dig> results in increased expression of early differentiation markers  and reduced expression of late differentiation markers, such as ivl and flg <dig>  <cit> . it is not surprising that lack of foxn <dig> in the nude mouse skin caused higher levels of ivl and flg <dig> expression  <cit> . high levels of ivl and flg <dig> expression in the nude and e <dig> skin detected in our study can indicate premature differentiation upon the loss of foxn <dig> function. a similar observation of premature differentiation of interfollicular epidermal stem cells was made upon loss of function due to wnt mutation  <cit> . these deductions are supported by the data showing that wnt regulates foxn <dig> expression in thymus and in the skin  <cit> .

surprisingly, in the uninjured skin  and epidermis , transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of genes associated with wound healing and its essential inflammation phase . fibronectin  <dig> , which is a component of the provisional matrix of embryos enabling migration and action of cells at the place of injury, is also up-regulated in uninjured nude and e <dig> skin   <cit> . moreover, the skin of nude and e <dig> samples exhibited a significant elevation in levels of interleukin 1α  mrna, a pro-inflammatory interleukin that triggers keratinocyte activation upon injury. similarly, il-1 f <dig> and il-1 f <dig>  novel players in the il- <dig> family signaling system are characteristic for activated  keratinocytes and are up-regulated in uninjured skin of nude and e <dig> mice . it should be noted that these two cytokines were shown to influence tissue remodeling  and fibronectin expression). additionally, proinflamatory cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> , which are normally rapidly translated in response to injury, are already up-regulated in un-injured skin of nude and e <dig> . slightly up-regulated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines can be beneficial for regenerative resolving of wound healing process, as cytokines attract and stimulate cells  at the place of injury. moreover, the mrl mouse possess increased populations of inflammatory cells during regenerative ear wound closure  <cit> . on the contrary, the robust inflammatory response in the adult-type repair is consider to be responsible for scar-forming healing usually associated with fibrosis and enhanced deposition of ecm  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that fine-tuned inflammation, together with a proper balance between cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and ecm deposition define whether the final outcome of injury is a chronic/non-healing ulcer, regenerated tissue, or a usual or hypertrophic scar. on the other hand, nude mice are severely immune-compromised, because non-active foxn <dig> leads to thymus agenesis and a deficiency of t-cells  <cit> . therefore, up-regulated transcripts of pro-inflammatory molecules and enhanced kallikreins activity suggest that the skin of nude mice, particularly the epidermal layer  can act as an immune, compensatory organ  <cit> .

it is remarkable that nude and e <dig> mice displayed elevated expression of genes that have been reported to be induced upon injury in scar healing models. this conclusion compromises ecm ; additional file 3: table s3), fn <dig> , serine proteases  cytoskeletal molecules , and proinflammatory cytokines . this predisposition to respond immediately, which is common between regenerative nude and e <dig> mice, is also partially true for the mrl mouse  <cit> . therefore, we assume that e <dig> and nude mice share a transcriptomic milieu that predisposes them to regenerative skin healing when wounding occurs.

functionally, foxn <dig> is considered to be a transcription factor that activates and stimulates the first stages of keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> . the analysis of genes in common for nude and e <dig> revealed down-regulation of a set of genes connected with differentiation and development processes . since nude and e <dig> do not have an active foxn <dig> gene the list of down-regulated genes may contain potential targets of foxn <dig>  among these possible targets are the genes coding transcription factors associated with the homeodomain: hox genes , extended hox genes , paired domain , paired-like domain , six/sine homeobox  and atypical hox genes  . these homeodomain-containing transcriptional regulators specify cell fate during embryonic development and promote embryonic stem cells differentiation  <cit>  and they are known to undergo dynamic repression by polycomb group  proteins during development  <cit> .

there is a concept that “cutaneous wound repair recapitulates embryonic skin development in numerous aspects, in an attempt to restore the integrity of the injured tissue”  <cit> . our data supports this, suggesting that the transcriptomic profile of uninjured nude skin resembles that of regenerative uninjured fetuses’ skin, that is, a neotenic relationship. similar retained features of embryonic metabolism were described in adult mrl mice  <cit> . in our regenerative models, we detected down-regulation of some transcription factors that promote differentiation and block proliferation of epidermal progeny cells . this can lead to an increase in the number of undifferentiated, presumably epidermal stem cells   <cit> . previously, it was shown that a local population of esc exerts a positive impact on skin regenerative capacity  <cit> . correspondingly, our previous data showed that large populations of nude dermal fibroblasts display stem cell biomarkers compared to wild type b <dig> dermal fibroblasts  <cit> . therefore, we assume that the lack of foxn <dig> activity prevents the final stages of differentiation  <cit>  and keeps cells in an immature progenitor-like state  <cit> .

genes enriched in nude skin but not shared with e <dig> fetuses
from the total of  <dig> genes that are differently regulated between nude vs b <dig> and not expressed in the e <dig> skin , we selected genes that are possibly related to foxn <dig> deficiency and provide a transcriptomic signature for regeneration . among these genes, members of the wnt, bmp and notch families were significantly altered . it has been shown that genes belonging to these families are responsible for the maintenance of skin homeostasis by playing a role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in the skin wound healing process . moreover, it is thought that they take part in regeneration and scarless skin wound healing  <cit> .table  <dig> selected group of genes characteristic for nude mice

agenes that are down regulated in e <dig> skin 




the analysis of differentially regulated genes revealed that wnt family genes are generally up-regulated in nude skin. elevated gene expression in nude skin was observed for wnt ligands wisp <dig>  wnt10a and wnt11; wnt mediator β-catenin  and wnt receptors frizzled  <dig>  and frizzled  <dig> . concurrently, wnt pathway inhibitors, dickkopf  <dig> , frizzled-related protein  and secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig>  were down-regulated. among the wnt family genes altered in the nude mouse, the expression of ctnnb <dig> mrna was up-regulated in the epidermis but not in the skin . in contrast, wnt7a and catenin β-like <dig>  were down-regulated in the skin of nude mice as was mmp- <dig>  a component of the wnt signaling pathway and the target gene for β-catenin in both nude and e <dig> skin .

in contrast to the genes of the wnt family, the genes related to notch and bmp are down-regulated in the nude skin . the notch group of genes includes the notch receptors , notch ligands  and its transcription factor targets, hes  and hey , are down-regulated. similar to notch, several genes in the bmp family are down-regulated in the nude skin, including bmp ligands , their receptor , and an intracellular component of the bmp pathway, smad <dig> .

the next group of genes enriched in nude skin but not shared with e <dig> is matrix metalloproteinases  together with metalloproteinases tissue inhibitors  . the products of these genes are indispensable for skin wound healing process resolution particularly during the final remodeling phase of healing  <cit>  and they are required for the regeneration process  <cit> . the present analysis confirmed our previous study showing high levels of mmps in the uninjured and post-injured skin of nude mice . it has been proposed that high levels of mmps  during the regeneration process can prevent scar formation  <cit> . our analysis revealed that mmp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> together with timp <dig> are up-regulated in the skin tissues of nude mice . the analysis of entire skin tissues as well as enzymatically separated epidermal part of the skin allowed us to detect an unusual pattern of mmp- <dig> expression. whereas mmp- <dig> expression was up-regulated in the skin , it was down-regulated in the epidermis .

changes in genes and protein expression– validation of sequencing data
to confirm and validate sequencing data we performed qrt-pcr, western blot and immunohistochemical detection experiments using independent biological samples from nude, b <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> skin. first, in order to establish and verify the levels of foxn <dig> mrna expression in the examined skin tissues, we performed qrt-pcr analysis . we detected no foxn <dig> transcripts in e <dig> skin samples, whereas its expression was detected in e <dig> and adult skin . foxn <dig> mrna expression was observed not only in b <dig> but also in foxn <dig> deficient nude mice although at lower levels. the highest levels of foxn <dig> transcripts were detected in enzymatically separated epidermis, the host tissue for the foxn <dig> expression . foxn <dig> mrna was detected in the nude skin tissue because a single base pair  deletion in the exon  <dig> introduces a frameshift and a premature stop codon causing the encoded protein to terminate upstream of the dna-binding domain .fig.  <dig> validation of sequencing data by qrt-pcr for foxn <dig> , mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig> . histological , immunohistochemical  analyses of skin tissues from e <dig> , e <dig> , nude  and b <dig>  skin. hematoxylin and eosin stained sections , and immunohistochemical detection of mmp- <dig> protein expression . figure l-o are the higher magnifications of figures h-k. arrows indicate positive reaction for mmp- <dig> in epidermis: e <dig>  and b <dig> ; dermis: e <dig>  and subcutenous tissues in nude . immunohistochemical sections  were counterstained with hematoxylin. e - epidermis. scale bar = 50 μm , 100 μm , 20 μm 




one of the characteristic features of nude skin is a robust up-regulation of mmp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> . qrt-pcr validation  confirmed that mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are up-regulated in the skin of nude mice as shown by rna-seq analysis . however, rna-seq results showed a discrepancy in mmp- <dig> expression between the whole skin samples and the enzymatically separated epidermis. in contrast to the skin, the epidermis from the nude skin showed significant down-regulation of mmp- <dig> expression . qrt-pcr examination of an independent set of samples from nude and b <dig> confirmed sequencing rna-seq results indicating differences between mmp- <dig> expression in epidermis . since the expression and regulation of mmp- <dig> seems to be of particular importance in skin we performed immunohistochemical detection of mmp- <dig> protein expression . whereas the mmp- <dig> protein in the nude skin tissue was localized to subcutaneous tissues and dermis with no expression in the epidermis , b <dig> skin showed strong mmp- <dig> expression in the epidermis . skin samples from e <dig>  and e <dig>  show mmp- <dig> protein expression in the epidermis  and dermis . the high levels of mmp- <dig> expression in nude dermis  could be partially explained by the differences in dermal fibroblasts phenotype between nude and wild type mice  <cit> . our previous studies showed the ability of nude dermal fibroblasts to synthesize higher than wild type mrna and protein levels of mmp- <dig>  <cit> . the transcriptomic data for ivl expression showed an increase in ivl transcript levels in e <dig> skin and in the nude skin and epidermis . western blot  and immunohistology  analyses showed higher levels of ivl protein in e <dig> than e <dig> . moreover, we observed strong ivl immunoreactivity in the entire epidermis of nude  but only at outer layer of b <dig>  epidermis.fig.  <dig> involucrin protein expression in nude, b <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> skin samples. representative western blots , densitometric analysis  and immunodetection  of involucrin protein expression in e <dig> , e <dig> , nude , b <dig>  skin samples. arrows indicate positive reaction for involucrin . immunohistochemical sections  were counterstained with hematoxylin. e – epidermis, hf – hair follicles. scale bar = 20 μm




foxn <dig> deficiency in epidermis affects dermal part of the skin
although the mechanism of foxn <dig> action is largely unknown, recent data point to fgf <dig> as a mediator of foxn <dig> function in the epidermis  <cit> . the present analysis showing the differences in gene expression between b <dig> and nude mice in epidermal and dermal skin parts  may indicate that foxn <dig> elicits its action not only within the epidermis but it participates in dermal cell functionality. moreover, our previous data clearly showed phenotypic differences between the nude and b <dig> dermal fibroblasts, indicating a population of immature  dermal fibroblasts in the nude dermis  <cit> . furthermore, the nude skin, as well as the nude dermal fibroblasts, expressed higher levels of mmps than in b <dig> mice  <cit> . consequently, we reasoned that foxn <dig> expression in the epidermis may affect dermal fibroblasts via fgf <dig>  to evaluate this concept, we measured the effect of fgf <dig> on mmps expression in the dermal fibroblasts from nude and b <dig> mice. isolated and cultured cells were treated for 24 h with increasing doses of fgf <dig> . the analysis of mmps mrna expression showed that fgf <dig> increased mmp- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> expression in both nude and b <dig> dermal fibroblasts but had no effect on mmp- <dig> expression. interestingly, the stimulatory effect of fgf <dig> was profound for the nude dermal fibroblasts. the increase in mmp- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> expression in nude dermal fibroblasts was already observed at a lower dose  of fgf <dig> to achieve the highest impact on mmp expression at 10 ng/ml . the profound effect of fgf <dig> on mmp- <dig> expression in the dermal fibroblasts from nude mice was confirmed by western blot analysis of protein isolates from nude and b <dig> dermal fibroblasts . collectively, we propose that b <dig> dermal fibroblasts achieve the adult/mature state through the first wave of foxn <dig> expression during embryonic development, whereas nude dermal fibroblasts, which respond much more strongly to fgf <dig> stimulation, are sustained in a fetal  stage. these data, together with our previous reports, support the concept that foxn <dig> activity is an essential condition to establish the adult skin phenotype. further on, foxn <dig> as a key component of skin maturation, could be responsible for scar-forming healing and its deficiency sustains skin in neoteny, which can lead to scar-free skin healing as it is observed in e <dig> and nude mice.fig.  <dig> in vitro analysis of fgf <dig> effects on mmp- <dig> , mmp- <dig> , mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>  expression in dermal fibroblasts from nude and b <dig> mice. quantitative rt-pcr for mmp- <dig> , mmp- <dig> , mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>  mrna expression and western blot for mmp- <dig>  protein are presented




CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report showing that two models of skin regeneration, nude mice and e <dig> fetuses, share similarities that comprise expression patterns associated with genes having specific biological and cellular functions . the genes associated with these functional terms may be considered as a signature for regeneration. moreover, based on the down-regulation of transcription factors, which promote differentiation instead of proliferation , we provide a theory that the retarded development of the skin of nude mice leads to the retention of a large population of immature, progenitor-like stem cells. foxn <dig> appears to be a pivotal control element of the developmental program and skin maturation. therefore, nude mice may be considered as a unique example of neoteny among mammals. in addition, nude and e <dig> mice can be viewed as genetically programmed to immediately respond to injury, since elevated levels of critical transcripts are already in place. the consequences of foxn <dig> deficiency suggest an interplay of foxn <dig> with wnt, bmp and notch signaling. moreover, foxn <dig> appears to be a regulator of mmp- <dig> expression in the skin.
