BACKGROUND
peanut  is an important crop grown world widely for both oil and protein production. the development of peanut embryo is inhibited by light above ground, and the development of embryo and pod resumes after the elongated ovaries are buried into soil . this special developmental process of peanut fruit is a complex, genetically programmed process involving many gene regulatory networks at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. dissecting the molecular mechanism governing peanut embryo and early pod development is helpful to broaden our knowledge on plant embryogenesis. previous studies demonstrated that peanut embryogenesis and pod development were affected by different wavelengths of light. for example, continuous irradiation with white, red or blue light inhibited embryogenesis and pod development whereas darkness or far red light promoted this process . gynophore elongation responded to light in the opposite manner, which was stimulated when grown in white, red or blue and inhibited when grown in darkness or far red light  <cit> . besides, plant endogenous hormones such as auxin , gibberellic acid , ethylene, abscisic acid  and brassinolides  are well known to play critical roles in embryo and fruit development  <cit> . in peanut, it was reported that either the content or the distribution patterns of hormones significantly changed during peanut early pod development . it has been shown that low concentration of iaa promotes peanut pod development, whereas high level inhibits peanut gynophore elongation  <cit> . gas can also promote the growth of gynophores in peanut. however, how light regulates hormone biosynthesis and signaling to initiate this interesting biological process is unknown.

micrornas  are a class of small non-coding rnas with approximately 20– <dig> nt in length. mirnas regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in almost all eukaryotes  <cit> . in general, mirnas specifically target messenger rnas  to inhibit their translation or induce their cleavage through partially or fully sequence complementary with their targets  <cit> . the past decade has witnessed an explosion in our knowledge on mirna regulation in various biological processes in plants. mir <dig> and mir <dig> coordinately regulate the timing of juvenile-to-adult transition during shoot development  <cit> . overexpression of mir <dig> in wild tomato causes a defect in flower development and female sterility through suppressing auxin response factor  <dig>  and auxin response factor  <dig>   <cit> . both mir <dig> and mir <dig> are involved in the regulation of seed development by controlling grain size and shape in rice  <cit> . increasing evidence indicated that mirna and hormone signaling interact to regulate those physiological processes. for examples, ga was shown to modulate mir <dig> levels during arabidopsis seed germination  <cit> . however, our knowledge on mirna functions controlling the species-specific biological processes in plants is quite limited.

our previous report has identified mirnas from peanut root, leaf and stem using deep sequencing approach  <cit> . however, there is no report on mirna regulation in peanut embryogenesis and early pod development and no functional mirna-mrna modules have been identified from peanut pod. to gain a better understanding of the function of mirna in peanut embryogenesis and early pod development, the current study characterized the expression profiles of mirnas in gynophores of three developmental stages during which the repressed embryo and ovary reactivate for further development. additionally, the degradome library sequencing for global identification of mirna targets in peanut was performed and new target genes were discovered., many of which involved in plant hormone signal transduction processes. these findings hinted at the important roles of mirnas in regulating peanut embryogenesis and early pod development and constructed an outline for the interaction between light signal, hormone and mirnas during peanut embryo and early pod development.

RESULTS
overview of small rna profiles in peanut gynophores
to assess the regulatory roles of mirnas in peanut embryogenesis and early pod development, we profiled srna accumulation in s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> gynophores . more than  <dig> million total reads and  <dig> million unique reads  were produced from each sample. about 78% of the total reads and 81% of the unique reads were perfectly mapped to peanut genome, and the rates of genomic match were similar across these three stages . the correlation coefficients were more than  <dig>  between two biological replicates . as shown in fig.  <dig>   <dig> nt class of srnas showed the highest abundance . the secondly abundant class of total reads was  <dig> nt srnas . this result was consistent with that found in rice  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and a previous study in peanut  <cit> , but different from that of wheat and grapevine  <cit> . the proportion of unique reads has no obvious difference among three stages. interestingly, the proportion of  <dig> nt total reads decreased slightly and the proportion of  <dig> nt total reads increased at s <dig> compared with s <dig> and s <dig> . the size distribution of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt total reads has no obvious difference among three stages. after removal of rrna, trna, snrna, snorna, repeats sequence and exon sequence , the remaining unique reads that present in two biological replicates were used to identify mirnas subsequently.fig.  <dig> length distribution of small rna reads in s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> gynophores. a the distribution of unique small rnas that present in two biological replicates. b the distribution of total small rnas that present in two biological replicates




identification of known and novel mirnas in peanut gynophore
to identify known mirnas in peanut, all the unannotated unique reads that perfectly mapped to peanut genome were aligned to plant mirnas in mirbase . a total of  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> families were identified . among them,  <dig> families were known and well conserved that present in two or more plant species. in addition,  <dig> families were also known but less conserved that present only in one plant species including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and others. furthermore,  <dig> peanut-specific mirna families loaded in mirbase were also detected in our study, for example, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  after identification of known mirnas, the remaining unique reads were used to identify novel mirnas by predicting the hairpin structures of their precursor sequences.  <dig> novel mirnas belonging to  <dig> families were identified in this study and were named as mirn <dig> to mir <dig> . the corresponding mirna* sequences of  <dig> novel mirnas were detected, further supporting the existence of these mirnas. most novel mirnas could only be produced from one locus, except mirn <dig> and mirn <dig>  which were produced from three and four loci, respectively . stem-loop rt-pcr was performed to validate the predicted new mirnas and  <dig> predicted mirnas were found to be expressed in peanut gynophore .table  <dig> known and novel mirna families identified in peanut gynorphore

differential expression of mirnas during peanut pod development
after normalization, we analyzed the expression pattern of all mirnas identified in this study . in total,  <dig> mirna families exhibited differential accumulation during early pod development. of them,  <dig> known mirna families and four novel mirna families were differentially expressed between s <dig> and s <dig>  whereas  <dig> known mirna families and seven novel mirna families showed different expression between s <dig> and s <dig> .  <dig> known mirna families and nine novel mirna families showed differential accumulation between stages s <dig> and s <dig> . to validate the sequencing data, qrt-pcr was performed to examine the expression of several mirnas that maybe related to early pod development and the results were in agreement with the sequencing data except for mirn <dig> where the sequencing result and qrt-pcr showed different patterns . as shown in fig. 3c, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were up-regulated significantly, while mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mirn <dig> were significantly down-regulated during early pod development . different accumulation levels of mirnas between different developmental stages suggested a possible mirna-mediated regulation of gene expression during peanut embryo and early pod development in a temporal manner.fig.  <dig> clustering and differential expression analysis of mirnas across s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> using deep sequencing data. data was presented as log2fold change by comparing mirna abundances  between s <dig> and s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  s <dig> and s1

degradome sequence analysis and target gene identification
to gain a better understanding of the regulatory role of mirnas during peanut early pod development, it is necessary to identify their target genes that could provide valuable information for mirna function during this process. two degradome libraries from gynophores that unburied and buried in soil for about three days  were constructed separately. by sequencing these two libraries,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million clean reads were obtained and more than 99% of the sequences were  <dig> or  <dig> nt in length. in total,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  unique reads were mapped to peanut cdnas which were subjected to target identification . the cleaved transcripts were categorized into three classes , as reported previously  <cit> . class  <dig> transcripts contained only one maximum peak from mirna-directed cleavage, representing perfect data with no other contamination. class  <dig> transcripts contained more than one maximum peaks and the mirna cleaved peaks are equal to the maximum. class  <dig> was transcripts with the peaks from mirna-directed cleavage lower than the maximum. in this study, a total of  <dig> target genes for  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> target genes for seven novel mirna families were identified . among the  <dig> identified targets,  <dig> targets  belonging to class  <dig>  whereas  <dig> and  <dig> were classified into class  <dig> and class  <dig>  respectively. most of the cleavage sites were located in cds region, and only a few cleavage sites were located in 5′-utr or 3′-utr . the abundance of cleaved transcripts was normalized using ‘reads per  <dig> million’  method. interestingly, the cleaved transcripts of many target genes were differently accumulated between these two libraries , providing important evidence for mirna function during early pod development in peanut.table  <dig> mirna-mrna target pairs identified in at least one library of peanut gynorphore with p-value ≤  <dig>

most targets of the conserved mirnas were transcription factors such as the squamosa promoter binding-like , teosinte branched1/cycloidea/pro-liferating cell factor <dig> , myb, arf, nac, gras and ap <dig>  which have been identified previously in diverse plant species  <cit> . mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been found to target disease resistance protein genes, and mir <dig> was found to target gene encoding ago <dig>  a key component of rna-induced silencing complex . additionally, one tas <dig> was identified as target of mir <dig> that give rise to the production of phased ta-sirnas from that precursor. for the less conserved mirnas, the targets were not enriched in transcription factors and were more likely to be involved in metabolic and signal transduction. most peanut-specific mirnas did not have detectable sliced targets in the degradome libraries. only two genes encoding pentatricopeptide repeat protein  were detected as mir <dig> targets. this may be explained by the low abundance of these mirnas or their sliced targets in peanut gynophore. in addition to the previously identified conserved targets we also identified many new targets in peanut for the known mirnas. these putative novel targets include digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase and solute carrier , heat shock protein , serine/threonine kinase , pprp , dna methyltransferase  and others . interestingly, one embryogenesis abundant protein gene was shown to be target of mir <dig>  one ga receptor gene and one br receptor kinase gene were shown to be target of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  these results were independently verified by rlm 5′-race analysis . these conserved mirnas regulated non-conserved targets in addition to the conserved targets may be specific to peanut and play important roles in pod development. as shown previously in soybean and tomato, the targets of novel mirnas were not enriched in transcription factors  <cit> . the present data confirmed these results. among the  <dig> targets of novel mirnas, only one target encoding transcriptional factor . two targets of mirn <dig> are involved in disease resistance . meanwhile, novel mirnas targeted a number of functional genes, such as e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase gene , major intrinsic protein gene , dna-directed dna polymerase gene  and cytochrome p <dig> gene . however, the function of these newly identified targets, and their regulation by mirna in peanut pod remains to be determined.fig.  <dig> target plots of newly identified target genes for known mirnas and target validation by rlm 5′-race. peaks in red are the signatures produced by mirna-directed cleavage. a cleavage features in gibberellin receptor mrna by mir <dig>  b cleavage features in embryogenesis abundant protein mrna by mir <dig>  c cleavage features in brassinosteroid receptor kinase mrna by mir <dig>  rlm 5′-race was used to verify the cleavage sites in gibberellin receptor gene, embryogenesis abundant protein gene and brassinosteroid receptor kinase gene by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the numbers above the vertical arrow indicate the number of sequences found at the exact cleavage site

all  <dig> target genes identified in this study were subjected to gene ontology  functional classification and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis to perceive their biological roles using wego toolkit  <cit> . a total number of  <dig> mirna targets could be annotated by go classification. it was determined that these target genes were involved in seven types of cellular component, six types of molecular function and  <dig> types of biological process with the cell part, binding and metabolic process were the most abundant groups in each category . according to kegg analysis,  <dig> target genes were significantly enriched in  <dig> pathways including plant hormone signal transduction, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, plant-pathogen interaction, metabolic pathways and ribosome biogenesis . plant hormone signal transduction pathway and the corresponding mirnas are shown in fig.  <dig>  in this pathway,  <dig> genes are targeted by seven mirnas. in addition, mir <dig> targets arf genes indirectly by giving rise to the formation of ta-sirnas  <cit> . moreover, three mirnas  are involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis process by targeting e <dig> ubiquitin ligase gene, through which control the protein accumulation levels of aux and della in iaa and ga pathways, respectively. these findings highlight the significant regulation of mirnas on peanut early pod development by effecting hormone signaling transduction pathways.fig.  <dig> kegg pathways related to plant hormone signal transduction targeted by peanut mirnas




correlated analysis between mirnas and target mrnas during early pod development
integrated analysis of mirnas and their targets expression can help to understand the regulatory pathways of mirnas and identify functional mirna-mrna modules involved in peanut embryo and early pod development. here, we profiled the accumulation of six target mrnas validated by degradome sequencing in peanut gynophore using qrt-pcr. to determine exactly how much of the mrna were cleaved by mirna, we detected the total mrna and the intact mrna that uncleaved by mirna using two pairs of primers designed in the 3′-utr region and spanning the mirna target site, respectively  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the total mrna of all the target genes increased during early pod development and the intact mrna were also increased except for ap <dig> which is targeted by mir <dig>  meanwhile, increased cleavage of the nac, pprp and ap <dig> transcripts  and decreased cleavage of the grf and another pprp transcripts  were observed at s <dig> and s <dig> compared with s <dig> stage, which in agreement with the mirna expression profiling that mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were up-regulated while mir <dig> and mir <dig> were decreased during peanut early pod development. these results suggested that mirna significantly modulate their intact target mrnas accumulation at the post-transcriptional level to regulate them at appropriate expression levels, controlling peanut early pod development.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of total and intact mrna levels in peanut gynophore using two different primers sets. error bars indicate the sd of three biological replicates. the asterisk indicated a statistically significant difference 




discussion
roles of mirnas during peanut embryogenesis and early pod development
the early stage of peanut pod development including gynophore elongation, pod enlargement, cell differentiation and embryogenesis is a complicated biological process regulated by coordinated gene expression. increasing evidence indicated that mirnas play important regulatory roles in cell differentiation and plant development. however, the function of mirnas during peanut embryogenesis and early pod development has not been addressed. in previous reports, zhao and chi identified  <dig> and  <dig> known mirna families from libraries constructed using mixed rnas from peanut root, stem, leave and seed, respectively  <cit> . in the current study, deep sequencing of small rna libraries constructed using peanut s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> gynophore rnas led to the discovery of  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> novel mirna families. interestingly,  <dig> known mirna families were first identified in peanut, suggesting that they were preferentially expressed and specific to peanut gynophore or young pod. among them,  <dig> known but less conserved mirnas were only identified in leguminous plants  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> known but non-conserved mirnas were also detected in peanut gynophore with a lower abundance than that of conserved mirnas. it has been proposed that conserved mirnas are probably responsible for regulation of the basic cellular and developmental processes, while the species-specific mirnas are involved in the regulation of species-specific regulatory pathways  <cit> . these legume- or peanut-specific mirnas may function in regulation of gene expression during peanut- or pod-specific processes. interestingly, mirn <dig> accumulated only in s <dig> stage and peanut-specific mir <dig> expressed only in s <dig> and s <dig> stages, indicating that they act in a tissue- or cell- specific manner and may play essential roles in peanut embryo and early pod formation.

putative mrna-mirna modules involved in peanut early pod development
to further explore the regulatory roles of mirnas during peanut embryogenesis and early pod development, we profiled their differential expression among three developmental stages. based on the normalized abundance of high-throughput sequencing data,  <dig> mirna families were differentially accumulated during early pod development which may contribute to cell proliferation and differentiation during embryogenesis and early developmental stage of peanut pod. a large number of conserved target genes for differentially expressed mirnas were identified, such as spl, myb, arf, nac, nf-y, gras, ap <dig> and tcp type transcription factors, which have been experimentally validated by previous studies  <cit> . based on the normalized abundance of degradome sequencing data, mir156-mediated cleavage of spl , mir164-mediated cleavage of nac , mir167-mediated cleavage of pprp , mir171-mediated cleavage of grsa , mir172-mediated cleavage of ap <dig> , mir393-mediated cleavage of f-box gene , mir396-mediated cleavage of grf  and mir1088-mediated cleavage of another pprp  were the most abundant and differently accumulated between the two degradome libraries. these mirna-mrna modules might be involved in regulating biological processes that facilitate peanut embryogenesis and pod development. indeed, mir156-mediated regulation of spl transcripts has been proved to play critical roles in regulating zygotic embryo development in arabidopsis  <cit> . mir164-mediated suppression of nac is required for embryogenesis, shoot meristem development, lateral root formation, senescence and other developmental processes  <cit> . our results showed that mir156-directed cleavage of spl declined whereas mir164-directed cleavage of nac transcripts increased during early pod development , which consists with the earlier observed expression profiles of mir <dig> and mir <dig> determined by qrt-pcr . moreover, a large number of new targets were also detected for conserved as well as non-conserved mirnas, although splicing frequency of these new targets was very low. for example, one embryogenesis abundant protein gene emerged as the target of mir <dig>  three mirnas  target genes encoding pprp. pprp has been demonstrated to play important roles in the first mitotic division during gametogenesis and in cell proliferation during embryogenesis  <cit> . these results suggested the present of non-conserved mirna-mrna modules that were specific to peanut and play crucial roles in regulating peanut-specific biological processes that promote embryo and early pod development.

network consist of hormone, light signal and mirnas in regulating peanut embryo and early pod development
peanut is a typical ‘aerial flower and subterranean fruit’ plant, and peanut fruit completes the development process under ground. after fertilization, peanut zygote divides few times and then the embryonic development stops when exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. along with the elongation of gynophore, the tip region  of gynophore is buried into soil, peanut embryogenesis and pod development resumes in the darkness, indicating that light is an important environmental signal that regulates pod formation and development. physiological studies demonstrated that red light and white light inhibited the growth of peanut ovules  <cit> . besides, multiple hormonal pathways are often modulated by light signal to control diverse developmental processes. given that the critical roles of mirna on plant embryogenesis, dissect the crosstalk among light signal, endogenous hormones and mirnas would be of great interest. our results showed that the expression of many known and novel mirnas that involved in embryo development was affected by light signal through profiling analysis between s <dig>  and s <dig>  such as mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> mediated pprp cleavage as well as mir <dig> mediated arf cleavage were known to participate in embryogenesis  <cit> . this result suggests that mirna might be a molecular integrator that link light signaling to the multiple hormone pathways such as auxin.fig.  <dig> regulatory network consist of light, mirnas and hormone during peanut embryo and early pod development. in green ovals are up-regulated mirnas and in red ovals are down-regulated mirnas under dark condition




plant endogenous hormones play vital roles in diverse developmental processes. for instance, ga can regulate gene expression to control stem elongation, seed germination and embryo development in plants . auxin is considered to be the main hormone involved in plant differentiation through controlling cell polarity, cell division and cell elongation  <cit> . furthermore, mirna regulation of auxin pathway plays an important role during cotton somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . in peanut gynophore, either the content or the distribution patterns of iaa, ga and br significantly changed from s <dig> to s <dig>  suggesting that these hormones are key regulators of peanut embryo development and pod formation  <cit> . here, it was found that eight target genes that participate in auxin signal transduction, two genes that participate in ga signal transduction and one gene that participates in br signal transduction were identified as mirna targets through degradome sequencing analysis . in addition, we also found that mir <dig> could mediate the cleavage of tas <dig> in peanut. the cleavage of tas <dig> by mir <dig> could induce the formation of phased ta-sirnas that mediate the regulation of auxin signal and in turn influence diverse developmental processes in flowering plants  <cit> . profiling analysis showed that several mirnas  participating in auxin and ga signal transduction pathways were differentially accumulated during peanut pod development. these differentially expressed mirnas and their hormone-related targets might be essential components of the regulatory networks in peanut embryogenesis and early pod development . collectively, mirnas, hormones and light signal comprises a complex network regulating specific biological processes controlling peanut embryo and pod development.

CONCLUSIONS
high-throughput sequencing together with bioinformatics and experimental approaches were used to explore the function of mirnas in peanut embryogenesis and early pod development. a total of  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirna families were discovered. among them, many mirnas were legume-specific or peanut-specific and differentially expressed during early pod development. in addition,  <dig> target genes were identified for  <dig> mirna families. several new targets that might be specific to peanut were found and further validated by rlm 5′-race. these peanut-specific and differentially expressed mirnas and their corresponding target genes might be essential components of the regulatory networks controlling in peanut embryogenesis and early pod development.
