BACKGROUND
ctcf  was originally identified as a transcriptional repressor in studies of the chicken lysozyme silencer  <cit>  and the regulation of the chicken c-myc gene  <cit> . since that time, ctcf has been extensively characterized in vertebrates as a ubiquitously-expressed, highly-conserved, multivalent transcription factor that utilizes different zinc finger  combinations to specifically bind diverse nucleotide sequences, resulting in the repression or activation of target genes, creation of hormone-responsive silencers and the formation of enhancer-blocking boundary elements . multiple, independent studies have established vertebrate ctcf as a central player in the regulation of gene expression via its association with every known vertebrate insulator  <cit> . further characterization of these proteins revealed their insulator function to be central in three contexts:  constitutive insulation of the chicken β-globin gene at the 5'hs <dig> site  <cit>  and the human apolipoprotein b gene at the 5' boundary  <cit> ,  imprinted insulation via methylation-sensitive binding to the igfr2-h <dig> control locus  <cit> , the dm <dig> locus  <cit>  and the dlk1/gtl <dig> locus  <cit> , and  as part of a more complex, multipartite insulator regulated by ligand binding  <cit> . most recently, ctcf-dependent insulators have been identified in transitional chromatin, with high levels of h <dig> acetylation and essentially no cpg methylation, between escape and inactivated genes on both mouse and human inactivated x chromosomes  <cit> . finally, tsix and ctcf have been proposed to comprise a regulated epigenetic switch for x-inactivation in mammals  <cit> . clearly, ctcf plays a pivotal role at multiple levels of gene regulation and genome organization in vertebrate organisms.

long thought to be exclusive to vertebrates, a ctcf orthologue was recently characterized in drosophila melanogaster with domain structure, binding site specificity and transcriptional repressor activity similar to that of vertebrate ctcf  <cit> . significantly, these researchers also demonstrated that a known drosophila insulator, fab <dig>  mediates enhancer-blocking via ctcf in both drosophila and vertebrate cell lines. we have cloned and characterized two mosquito ctcf-like cdnas encoding polypeptides with significant similarity and insulator binding properties to both the vertebrate and drosophila ctcfs. analysis of available genome sequence from numerous invertebrate species yields promising candidates for additional ctcf orthologues. clearly, this versatile protein has much more ancient roots than once thought.

RESULTS
cloning of ae. aegypti and an. gambiae ctcf-like cdnas
a blast search using the human ctcf protein sequence  <cit>  as a query uncovered a cdna from d. melanogaster , subsequently characterized by moon et al.  <cit>  as an orthologous ctcf factor. this sequence was then used to query the an. gambiae genome assembly at the ensembl database  <cit> , resulting in a highly significant hit of the predicted novel gene ensangg <dig> . these two dipteran sequences were aligned with known vertebrate ctcf sequences from gallus gallus  <cit> , mus musculus and homo sapiens  <cit> , rattus norvegicus  and xenopus laevis  <cit>  using the clustalw algorithm . this multiple sequence alignment was used for degenerate pcr primer design. degenerate pcr amplification, using ae. aegypti larval cdna as a template, yielded a single pcr product of  <dig> base pairs, corresponding to a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide containing six of the eleven predicted zinc-finger domains. pcr amplification was initially performed with an an. gambiae larval cdna template and primers corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the predicted novel coding sequence. this yielded a single product of  <dig> base pairs, corresponding to a translated polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues. subsequent 5' and 3' race  in both species yielded putative full-length cdnas of  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs for ae. aegypti  and an. gambiae , respectively. alignment of the corresponding polypeptide sequences with both the d. melanogaster and h. sapiens ctcfs revealed significant differences in the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of the protein, however there was 38% identity and 56% similarity across all eleven zinc finger domains . furthermore, 68% of the critical binding residues were conserved, despite at least  <dig> million years of divergence between invertebrate and vertebrate species  <cit> .

ctcf appears widespread in drosophila species
available genome sequence for multiple drosophilid species was queried at flybase  <cit>  using the an. gambiae amino acid sequence and the tblastx algorithm. all species searched produced single hits of very high significance, ≤ e- <dig>  each of these was submitted as a blastp query of the non-redundant database at ncbi  <cit>  and confirmed to be a significant match to known ctcfs. sequences with complete zinc finger regions were trimmed to the zinc-finger region plus five flanking amino acid residues and aligned with the corresponding region of ctcfs from h. sapiens, g. gallus, x. laevis, danio rerio , tetraodon nigroviridis , and fugu rubripes . the corresponding region of zinc finger protein  <dig> from caenorhabditis elegans , a protein that contains  <dig> c2h <dig> zinc finger domains, a coil-coil region and predicted nuclear localization sequence, was also included in the alignment and used as an outgroup in the subsequent phylogenetic analysis. two consensus distance-based trees, neighbor-joining  <cit>   and fitch-margoliash  <cit>  , were generated with  <dig> bootstrap replicates using the phylip software package  <cit> . additionally, a maximum-likelihood tree generated by  <dig>  iterations of tree-puzzle  <cit>   and a bayesian analysis tree generated by  <dig>  cycles of bambe  <cit>  with  <dig>  cycles of burn-in , yielded identical branch topologies.

mosquito ctcf is expressed constitutively in all developmental stages and is upregulated in early embryos and the ovaries of blood-fed females
reverse-transcriptase -pcr amplifications of rna isolated from embryos, ovaries, larvae, pupae and adults shows ctcf expression across all stages of development and in the ovarian tissues of both ae. aegypti and d. melanogaster . early ae. aegypti embryos and ovarian tissues from both species clearly show increased expression levels.

polyclonal antisera raised against an. gambiae ctcf recognizes a single protein band in lysates from an. gambiae sua <dig> cultured cells
immunoblotting of total cell lysate from an. gambiae sua <dig> cultured cells with rabbit antisera raised against a c-terminal fragment of an. gambiae ctcf results in identification of a single band migrating at ~ <dig> kd .

mosquito ctcf binds in-vitro to both the chicken 5'hs <dig> and the drosophila fab <dig> insulators
as we were unable to express the full-length mosquito ctcf protein in bacteria, whole cell lysates were prepared from the an. gambiae sua <dig>  <cit>  cell line and used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  to assess whether mosquito ctcf could bind known ctcf-associated insulator sequences . the intensity of the shifted bands increased with application of greater amounts of protein lysate. the detectable complex was competed by cold, unlabeled probe, indicating that binding was indeed specific. in addition, all reactions contained a 1200-fold excess of cold, non-specific c/g-rich sequences, further illustrating specificity. finally, the complex could be partially shifted by polyclonal anti-sera generated against the c-terminal region of the an. gambiae ctcf protein.

discussion
vertebrate ctcfs, from fish to human, are ≥ 98% identical across the entire zinc finger core of the protein. comparison of the three dipteran ctcfs reveals 54% identity and 68% similarity within this same region. in addition, amino acid residues considered critical for dna binding  <cit>  are 89% conserved among these three insect species. this apparent discrepancy can be partially addressed by investigating the molecular substitution rate heterogeneity among vertebrates and invertebrates. recent maximum likelihood analysis of a set of  <dig> nuclear genes for vertebrates and dipterans, with arabidopsis as an outgroup, suggests that the rate of vertebrate molecular evolution slowed considerably with respect to that of dipterans, prior to the origin of the crown-group, osteichthyes  <cit> . the much shorter generation times of dipterans have undoubtedly facilitated significant differences in their genome sizes  and gene organization patterns, attributable primarily to the number and distribution of repetitive sequences  <cit> . this would perhaps result in predictions of even greater sequence divergence than is observed in the ctcf genes. it seems likely that at least some of the many attributed vertebrate functions of ctcf are ancestral.

each of the species examined yielded a single, extremely significant match followed by numerous matches of lesser significance, suggesting a single copy locus. significant divergence in available n-terminal or c-terminal sequence supports the earlier observation that dipteran genomes have evolved very quickly, and thus these regions may not be critical to the conserved ancestral function of this gene. additionally, these regions may be more directly involved in protein-protein interactions with other proteins having likewise undergone evolutionary adaptation. high bootstrap support and essentially identical trees generated by four independent methods establishes the tree presented in fig.  <dig> as representative of the evolution of this gene sequence. less bootstrap support in the vertebrate clade is more indicative of the homogeneity of the sequence, rather than uncertainty as to where these species should be located in the tree. clearly, ctcf is present in vertebrates from fish through mammals and is highly conserved. of interest is its consistent presence in all drosophila species queried. the relatedness of the protein sequences mirror the accepted taxonomic relationships among these species as presented at flybase  <cit> , likely indicative of a conserved critical function. significant est evidence from the flour beetle, tribolium castaneum, the honey bee, apis mellifera, and the silkworm moth, bombyx mori, suggests the presence of ctcf-like genes in multiple insect orders.

the rt-pcr data from both mosquito and fly are consistent with one another, repeatable, and in agreement with both in-situ hybridization data  <cit>  posted for the fly at the berkeley drosophila genome project website  <cit>  and fly microarray data summarized at yale university's drosophila developmental gene expression timecourse website  <cit> . in-situ hybridization shows high-levels of drosophila ctcf transcript ubiquitously distributed throughout stage 1– <dig> embryos. mrna levels then decrease until approximately stage  <dig> where they then increase primarily in the developing nervous and sensory tissues. the neural-specific expression pattern also corresponds to findings in x. laevis where in-situ hybridization with staged embryos revealed weak homogeneous staining prior to stage  <dig>  with subsequent upregulation in neural tissues and the sensory organs of the head  <cit> . furthermore, over-expression of ctcf in mice during early embryogenesis resulted in decreased expression of the highly conserved homeobox gene pax <dig>  causing ocular defects  <cit> . microarray data analysis clusters fly ctcf  with genes exhibiting a single peak in expression during development, those showing significant expression increases in early embryogenesis, genes with expression changes of at least four-fold across development, and those expressed in the female germline  <cit> . taken together, these expression data and the corresponding functional data from vertebrates suggest that ctcf may indeed also be multi-functional in insects. some possible roles include the regulation of homeobox genes like pax <dig>  the facilitation of chromatin organization during early development and the establishment and/or maintenance of heterochromatic and euchromatic regions.

the emsa data support a role for ctcf in endogenous mosquito insulator function and confirm recent findings that the insulator function of ctcf is conserved from invertebrate to vertebrate species  <cit> . currently, position effect and position-effect variegation complicate efforts to establish stable transgenic lines in ae. aegypti and other mosquitoes. particularly problematic is the highly repetitive nature of much of the intergenic sequence, as well as the compact nature of the genome, which places regulatory elements from neighboring genes in close proximity to one another, where they may inappropriately impact the transgene of interest. the ability to flank transgenes with short, conserved endogenous insulator sequences could significantly improve observed expression levels, and possibly increase the frequency of recovery of transgenic individuals.

CONCLUSIONS
we have cloned the cdnas for two putative mosquito ctcf proteins. we have presented bioinformatics evidence that ctcf is likely present in many arthropod species and that the ancestral portion of the protein is clearly the zinc-finger region. constitutively expressed in all life stages, mosquito ctcfs are highly upregulated in early embryos and in the ovarian tissues of blood-fed female mosquitoes. finally, mosquito ctcf specifically binds both the chicken 5'hs <dig> β-globin and the fly fab <dig> insulator sequences. further characterization of these ctcfs and their binding sites will provide a promising avenue for insulating transgenes in these medically-important mosquito species.
