BACKGROUND
timely activation as well as termination of inflammatory responses is essential for proper functioning of the immune system. a balanced output of the vertebrate immune response is dependent on several regulatory mechanisms, in which micrornas  have recently emerged as new players with critical importance
 <cit> . several human diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders, have been associated with dysregulation of mirna expression both in a positive or negative regulatory manner
 <cit> . mirnas are evolutionary conserved, genome-encoded small rnas  that down-regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by either translational repression or by mrna degradation through binding to the 3′-utr of their target mrnas
 <cit> . mirnas were found to have roles in a diverse range of processes ranging from development, cellular differentiation, hematopoiesis, apoptosis, and growth, to the functioning of the immune system
 <cit> .

the role of host mirnas in bacterial infections has been addressed in several previous studies. mirnas were observed to be differentially regulated by toll-like receptor -mediated recognition of bacterial molecules. for instance, lipopolysaccharide  stimulation of tlr <dig> and downstream nfκb activity induced mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-155
 <cit> . mice deficient in mir- <dig> could not be protected by vaccination against salmonella typhimurium infection and showed strong defects in t-cell cytokine production
 <cit> . in another study, salmonella typhimurium infection was found to induce rapid down-regulation of let- <dig> mirna family members in macrophages, thereby leading to an upregulation of let- <dig> targets, the il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokines
 <cit> . il- <dig> production in lps-stimulated macrophages was also found to be regulated by mir-98
 <cit> . furthermore, mir- <dig> was found to suppress immune responses to listeria monocytogenes and mycobacterium tuberculosis by targeting ifn-γ
 <cit> .

the lps-inducible mir- <dig> family comprises two members in human, mir-146a and mir-146b, which are transcribed from different genes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . they have the same seed sequence  and differ in their mature sequence by only two nucleotides at the 3′end. dysregulation of mir-146a and mir-146b has been observed in many types of malignant tumors and several studies implicate these mirnas as metastasis suppressors
 <cit> . mir-146a has also been implicated in different autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and sjögren’s syndrome
 <cit> . the first indication of the role of mir-146a/b in innate immunity came from work of taganov et al.
 <cit> , showing increased expression of these mirnas in the human monocytic thp- <dig> cell line when triggered by lps. promoter analysis revealed that induction of the mir-146a gene by lps, tnfα, and il- <dig> is mediated by the nfκb transcription factor
 <cit> . in addition, 3′-utr luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the tlr signalling intermediates irak <dig> and traf <dig> are potential targets of mir-146a and mir-146b
 <cit> . these data suggested that the mir- <dig> mirnas function in a negative feedback pathway of tlr and cytokine signalling by targeting irak <dig> and traf <dig> mrnas for down-regulation, a conclusion supported by recent analysis of mir-146a knockout mice
 <cit> . mir-146a has also been shown to function as a negative regulator of interferon  signalling by targeting the irf <dig> and stat- <dig> transcription factors
 <cit>  and to control the resolution of t-cell responses in mice
 <cit> .

the zebrafish provides a useful model to study innate immunity, which is the primary line of defence against infections during the first few weeks of development, when functional adaptive immunity is not yet present
 <cit> . the zebrafish model combines an efficient genetic toolbox with excellent possibilities for high resolution imaging of host-microbe interactions at the early life stages , when zebrafish are transparent
 <cit> . many zebrafish infection models for bacterial pathogens have recently been developed, among which the s. typhimurium and m. marinum models are the best characterized
 <cit> . the major signalling pathways of the innate immune system are conserved within all vertebrates
 <cit>  and the repertoire of zebrafish mirnas is well described
 <cit> . since mirnas are strongly conserved among all vertebrates, the advantages of the zebrafish model organism may be exploited to elucidate mirna functions in the vertebrate host response to bacterial infections. as in mammals, the zebrafish mir- <dig> family has two members, named dre-mir-146a and dre-mir-146b, which are present within genes located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the irak <dig> and traf <dig> homologs of both zebrafish and human contain putative target sites for mir- <dig> in their 3′-utrs, suggesting that mir- <dig> feedback control of tlr signalling is evolutionary conserved. here we report on a microarray study of mirna expression, which showed that mir-146a and mir-146b are commonly induced by infection of zebrafish embryos with salmonella typhimurium and by infection of adult fish with mycobacterium marinum. we demonstrate the requirement of the myd88-traf <dig> pathway for the infection-triggered induction of mir-146a/b in the zebrafish embryo model. furthermore, we used morpholino knockdown to suppress the function of mir-146a and mir-146b and analyzed the effects of this down-regulation by rna deep sequencing  of embryos infected with salmonella typhimurium. while no major effects on known targets of the myd88-traf <dig> pathway were observed, apolipoprotein-mediated lipid transport emerged as a novel infection-inducible pathway under control of mir-146a/b.

RESULTS
microarray analysis identifies infection-inducible mirnas in zebrafish embryos and adults
in order to study the effects of bacterial infection on mirna expression profiles in zebrafish we examined two infection conditions that are known from previous mrna transcriptome studies to elicit a strong proinflammatory immune response: embryos at 8 hours post infection  with the s. typhimurium sl <dig> strain and adult fish that were in the end stage of disease at 6 days post infection  with the m. marinum mma <dig> strain
 <cit> . since embryos rely solely on innate immunity and adults also have adaptive immunity, the combination of these infection models allows determining the contribution of the two arms of the immune system to the induction of mirnas
 <cit> . to quantify microrna gene expression profiles we used a custom designed 8× <dig> k agilent zebrafish array. s. typhimurium infection of one-day old embryos resulted in differential expression of probes for  <dig> mirnas annotated in mirbase , while the m. marinum-infected adults showed differential expression of probes for  <dig> mirnas  . the mirna platform also contains probes for predicted hairpin structures in the zebrafish genome that might cover additional mirnas. a large number of these probes showed differentially expression in the adult infection study , while a much lower number was affected by infection of embryos . since the biological relevance of these predicted small rnas is currently unknown, we did not consider them further in this study, but focused on the known mirnas annotated in mirbase. several of these mirnas were commonly up-regulated by both of the infection conditions, including mir- <dig> , mir-29a, mir-29b, mir-146a, and mir-146b . since zebrafish embryos have not yet developed adaptive immunity, it can be concluded that the context of innate immunity is sufficient to induce the expression of these mirnas.

mir-146a and mir-146b are induced during zebrafish infection with s. typhimurium and m. marinum
mirnas of the mir- <dig> family, which emerged as infection-inducible mirnas from the microarray analysis of embryonic and adult zebrafish, have previously been linked to the innate immune response in mammalian systems
 <cit> . to confirm the induction of these mir- <dig> family members we analyzed mir-146a and mir-146b expression by taqman qpcr analysis. mir- <dig>  which showed unaltered expression in the microarray study, was used as a control for normalization. in agreement with the microarray data, mir-146a and b were specifically induced in embryos at 8 hours post injection  with the s. typhimurium sl <dig> strain . their induction was also observed in infections with an attenuated lps mutant  strain, sf <dig> . furthermore, induction of mir-146a and mir-146b was detected in zebrafish larvae at an advanced stage of m. marinum mma <dig> infection . the increase of mir-146a expression in embryos infected with s. typhimurium could be completely blocked with a morpholino targeting this mirna  and this morpholino was effective even up to the larval stage in reducing m. marinum-induced mir-146a expression . the s. typhimurium-induction of mir-146b in embryos could also be reduced by morpholino treatment, , but the mir-146b morpholino was no longer effective at the larval stage where m. marinum infection was analyzed. in agreement with the microarray data, induction of mir-146a and mir-146b was also confirmed in adult zebrafish infected with m. marinum .
 <cit> . data are the mean ± sem of three fish per condition. expression levels in all experiments were determined by taqman qpcr and relative expression levels are shown with the mock control set at  <dig>  asterisks indicate significant differences  tested by one-way anova analysis with tukey’s method as post-hoc test  or by an unpaired t-test .

infection-inducible expression of mir-146a and mir-146b is affected by defects in signalling via the myd88-traf <dig> pathway
we used the s. typhimurium embryo infection model to investigate the dependency of mir-146a and mir-146b induction on tlr pathway genes. first, we used a previously described morpholino knockdown model for traf <dig>  a central intermediate in tlr and tnf receptor signalling
 <cit> . the s. typhimurium-induced expression levels of mir-146a and mir-146b were significantly lower in traf <dig> knockdown embryos compared to controls . next, we analyzed mir-146a and mir-146b induction in a myd <dig> mutant line
 <cit> . similar as under traf <dig> knockdown conditions, mir-146a and mir-146b were still infection-inducible in myd <dig> mutant embryos, but their expression levels were significantly higher in infected wild type siblings . therefore, we conclude that mir-146a and mir-146b induction is at least partially dependent on myd <dig> and traf <dig> 

mir-146a and mir-146b knockdown does not affect leukocyte development in zebrafish embryos
loss of function studies in mice and zebrafish suggested a possible role of mir-146a in the development of myeloid cells, in addition to its proposed inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory signalling
 <cit> . to investigate the possible requirement of mir-146a and mir-146b for leukocyte development in zebrafish embryos, we designed two different morpholinos for each mirna . the efficiency of the knockdown was confirmed by taqman qpcr analysis, showing that basal expression of mir-146a and mir-146b  as well as their infection inducibility  was reduced by morpholino treatments. both of the morpholinos designed for mir-146a  did not affect mir-146b expression, therefore showing specific knockdown of mir-146a only . however, one of the mir-146b morpholinos  showed knockdown of both mir-146a and mir146b expression . to assess leukocyte numbers we performed immunostaining for the pan-leukocytic marker l-plastin and histochemical staining for myeloperoxidase  activity, a specific enzyme of neutrophils. first, we analyzed the effect of combined knockdown of mir-146a and mir-146b at  <dig> dpf. no differences were observed between controls and morphants in the numbers of l-plastin-stained leukocytes  or mpx-positive neutrophils  at this stage. since another study had reported an inhibitory effect of mir-146a knockdown on leukocyte development at  <dig> dpf
 <cit> , we next analyzed the separate effects of mir-146a and mir-146b knockdown in more detail over a critical period of leukocyte development from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf. during this period primitive myeloid cells first appear over the yolk sac, and subsequently invade the head. this first wave of primitive myeloid cells is rapidly followed by differentiation of the first erythro-myeloid precursor cells in the caudal blood island region. we performed l-plastin immunostaining with 2 h intervals over the period from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf. the total number of l-plastin-positive leukocytes showed a similar increase over this time course between control embryos and embryos injected with 146amo <dig>  146amo <dig>  or 146bmo <dig> . 146bmo <dig> could not be included in this quantitative analysis because it affected embryo development. nevertheless, l-plastin positive immune cells were still present in 146bmo <dig> morphants with mild  or severe phenotypes . based on these results, we conclude that mir-146a and mir-146b are not required for leukocyte differentiation during zebrafish embryo development.

combined knockdown of mir-146a and mir-146b does not have a major effect on pro-inflammatory gene expression during s. typhimurium infection
in previous work, we observed that knockdown of a negative regulator of the immune response, the ptpn <dig> phosphatase gene, resulted in a hyperinduction of pro-inflammatory gene expression during s. typhimurium infection
 <cit> . since mir- <dig> has also been proposed as a negative regulator of innate immunity
 <cit> , we hypothesized that mir- <dig> knockdown might have a similar effect. to test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of the combination of mir-146a and mir-146b morpholinos on gene expression in infected and mock-injected embryos by rna deep sequencing  . first we analyzed the basal expression differences between morpholino knockdown and the control in mock-injected embryos. only  <dig> genes were affected by knockdown of mir-146a and mir-146b, among which  <dig> genes are members of the p <dig> signalling pathway . this might reflect a non-specific effect of the mir- <dig> knockdown procedure, since morpholino effects on the p <dig> pathway are relatively common
 <cit> . s. typhimurium infection had a much different effect than morpholino treatment  and resulted in significant alteration of kegg pathways related to the immune response and metabolism , in agreement with previous studies
 <cit> . in statistical comparison between uninfected and infected groups, the total number of infection-regulated genes was higher in mir- <dig> morphants  than in control embryos  . direct statistical comparison between the infected control and morpholino groups also showed a higher number of infection-regulated genes in mir- <dig> morphants . however, the only pro-inflammatory marker that was induced by infection to higher levels in mir- <dig> morphants compared with the controls was the matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  gene . rnaseq showed a  <dig> -fold higher infection-induction of this gene in mir- <dig> morphants, which was confirmed by qpcr analysis . other pro-inflammatory genes, such as interleukin 1b , cxcl and ccl family chemokines, and transcriptional regulators of the immune response were induced to similar levels in mir- <dig> morphants and controls. in conclusion, knockdown of mir-146a and mir-146b in zebrafish embryos did not have a strong effect on innate immunity signalling in the first 8 hours of the response to s. typhimurium infection, despite the increased expression of these mirnas during this phase.
 <cit> . pathways linked with innate immunity and metabolism were significantly enriched by infection in both the control and morpholino treatment groups . pathways for p <dig> signalling and apoptosis were enriched due to 146mo treatment both in the absence and presence of infection . a set of apolipoprotein genes was significantly up-regulated by infection only in the 146mo treatment group .

combined knockdown of mir-146a and mir-146b leads to increased infection-inducibility of apolipoprotein genes
instead of a significant effect on known innate immune response genes, the rnaseq analysis revealed a possible effect on lipid transport pathways in s. typhimurium-infected mir- <dig> morphants. six members of the apolipoprotein family  were significantly induced upon s. typhimurium infection of mir- <dig> morphants but not in infected control embryos. to confirm this observation we performed qpcr analysis for the apolipoprotein gene family members . only s. typhimurium-infected embryos were analyzed, since rnaseq analysis  showed an effect of mir- <dig> morpholinos on apolipoprotein gene expression levels in infected embryos but not in mock-injected controls. results showed that under conditions of s. typhimurium infection, the expression levels of genes apoa1a, apoa <dig>  apoba, apobb, apoc1l, apoeb were between  <dig> - and 3- fold higher in mir- <dig> morphants compared with control embryos. therefore, mir- <dig> mirnas may be involved in fine-tuning of lipid-mediated inflammatory responses of the zebrafish embryo.
 <dig>  gene expression levels of six apolipoprotein genes, apoa1a, apoa <dig>  apoba, apobb, apoc1l, and apoeb, were analyzed by qpcr in two replicate infection experiments  and relative expression levels are shown with the lowest expression level set at  <dig>  data are the mean ± sem of triplicate qpcr measurements. asterisks indicate significant differences  determined by an un-paired t-test.

discussion
by microarray analysis of mirna expression in zebrafish we found that mirnas of the mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> families were commonly induced by infection of embryos with s. typhimurium and by infection of adult fish with m. marinum. the induction of members of the mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> families was in line with earlier microarray studies, which reported these along with some other mirnas, like mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> as infection-inducible
 <cit> . we did not detect altered expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which were found to be inducible during zebrafish infection with vibrio harveyi <cit> . we focused our study on the mir- <dig> family, which is strongly linked with immune-related diseases in human. we used zebrafish at the embryo stage, when only innate immunity is functional, as an in vivo model to study the role of mir- <dig> during bacterial infection.

the mir-146a and mir-146b sequences are conserved between zebrafish and human as well as target sites in the 3′-utr of mrnas of innate immune pathway genes such as irak <dig> and traf <dig>  which are experimentally validated targets of mir-146
 <cit> . therefore, mir-146a and mir-146b of zebrafish may function in feedback control of tlr signalling, like the human and murine counterparts
 <cit> . to study the pathway by which mir- <dig> expression is induced in zebrafish embryos upon infection we used embryos in which tlr signalling was disrupted by morpholino knockdown of traf <dig> or by mutation of myd <dig>  the induction levels of mir-146a and mir-146b upon s. typhimurium infection were reduced under conditions of traf <dig> or myd <dig> deficiency, but induction was not completely abolished. in the case of traf <dig> deficiency, the residual induction of mirna expression may be due to a partial morpholino knockdown effect. we have previously shown that mutation of myd <dig> strongly affects the innate immune response to s. typhimurium infection, but that innate immune genes can still be induced to lower levels in the absence of functional myd88
 <cit> . therefore, it is likely that both the myd88-traf6-dependent pathway and parallel myd88-independent signalling routes contribute to the infection-induced expression of mir- <dig> 

a recent study by ghani et al.
 <cit>  suggested mir-146a to be required for myeloid cell differentiation in mouse and zebrafish. they reported that mir-146a morpholino knockdown caused an almost complete absence of myeloid cells in zebrafish embryos at  <dig> dpf. however, in our analysis we found no evidence for an inhibitory effect of mir- <dig> deficiency on myeloid cell development. we used two morpholinos for mir-146a , and verified the knockdown effect by taqman qpcr, which showed that the morpholinos effectively inhibited both the basal expression and the infection-induced expression. by immunostaining for the pan-leukocytic marker l-plastin we detected no differences in myeloid cell development between mir-146a morphants and controls over an elaborate time course between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, which comprises the critical embryonic stages when myeloid cells differentiate and enter the circulation. furthermore, no effect on neutrophil differentiation at  <dig> dpf was detected. for mir-146b we also did not observe an effect on leukocyte development with two different morpholinos targeting this mirna. ghani et al.
 <cit>  used mrna in situ hybridization for detection of l-plastin, which might explain the difference with our study in which we used a sensitive immunolabelling method, which is widely used for detection and quantification of myeloid cells in zebrafish embryos
 <cit> . our conclusion that myeloid development in zebrafish embryos is not inhibited by mir-146a or mir-146b deficiencies is in line with the phenotype of mir-146a knockout mice, which also were not impaired in myeloid differentiation but in fact showed hyperproliferation of myeloid cells leading to autoimmunity
 <cit> .

knockout mice of mir-146a are hyperresponsive to lps, showing increased up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf and il-6
 <cit> . we used s. typhimurium infection of zebrafish embryos, which results in strong pro-inflammatory gene induction, to analyze the knockdown effect of mir-146a and mir146b by rnaseq analysis. we used a combination of morpholinos against mir-146a and mir-146b in the rnaseq study to avoid that the two mirnas might compensate for each other’s loss-of-function, as their mature sequences differ only by two nucleotides. several genes in the p <dig> pathway, including p <dig> itself, were up-regulated in mir- <dig> morphants as compared to controls under infected as well as non-infected conditions. this might be attributed to the well known off target effects of morpholino oligonucleotides
 <cit> . however, as mir- <dig> has been frequently linked with cancer, a direct effect on the p <dig> pathway cannot be excluded
 <cit> . in fact, one of the p <dig> pathway genes up-regulated by mir- <dig> knockdown, cdkn1a , is an experimentally validated target of mir-146a in human
 <cit> . in total we found  <dig> genes which were significantly up-regulated in mir- <dig> infection as compared to control infection. besides cdkn1a, only one other gene, fibrinogen beta chain , showed an overlap with the predicted targets of zebrafish mir-146a and mir-146b in mirbase. fibrinogen has roles in cell adhesion, hematopoiesis, and in coagulation and complement cascades associated with primary defence against bacterial infections
 <cit> . expression levels of other known targets of mir- <dig> involved in innate immunity, such as irak <dig>  traf <dig>  irf <dig> and stat <dig>  were not affected, but this was not unexpected since mirnas can act by translational inhibition.

the matrix metalloproteinase gene mmp <dig> is one of the most strongly induced pro-inflammatory markers in s. typhimurium infection
 <cit> . the combined morpholino knockdown of mir-146a and mir-146b led to slightly increased induction of this gene during s. typhimurium infection; however, this induction of mmp <dig> was not accompanied by a general hyperinduction of other pro-inflammatory markers in the rnaseq analysis. mmp <dig> is not a predicted target gene of mir- <dig> in human or zebrafish, but human mmp <dig> was found to be down-regulated upon mir-146a/b overexpression in mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells and in thp- <dig> macrophages
 <cit> . this down-regulation was suggested to occur via tlr-mediated and nfκb-dependent pathways rather than by direct targeting of mmp <dig> <cit> . likewise, the induction of zebrafish mmp <dig> under mir-146a/b knockdown conditions might be an indirect consequence of effects on upstream signalling proteins. in agreement, we have previously shown that mmp <dig> induction by s. typhimurium infection is mediated by traf <dig>  which is a known target of mir-146
 <cit> .

by targeting components of tlr signalling, mir- <dig> has been shown to function as a negative regulator of the innate immune response in mammals
 <cit> . however, in our study of s. typhimurium infection in zebrafish embryos, mir- <dig> knockdown did not have a strong impact on the induction of proinflammatory genes. notably, the effect of mir- <dig> knockdown was minor in comparison with knockdown analysis of ptpn <dig>  which encodes a sh2-domain phosphatase that functions as a negative regulator of innate immunity
 <cit> . in the same experimental set-up, s. typhimurium infection of zebrafish embryos after knockdown of ptpn <dig> resulted in hyperinduction of mmp <dig> and a wide range of cytokines, other immune effectors genes, and transcriptional regulators of the immune response
 <cit> , while in the case of mir- <dig> knockdown only mmp <dig> was slightly higher induced. furthermore, hyperinflammation in ptpn <dig> morphants impaired control of s. typhimurium infection
 <cit> , while mir- <dig> knockdown had no such effect . these results support that in the early response of zebrafish embryos to s. typhimurium infection ptpn <dig> functions as a much stronger negative feedback regulator than mir- <dig>  this would be consistent with the idea that mirnas function in a subtle fine-tuning of the immune response
 <cit> .

while the overall knockdown effect observed in our rnaseq analysis was relatively minor, apolipoprotein-mediated lipid transport emerged as an infection-inducible pathway under mir- <dig> knockdown conditions. numerous studies have linked apolipoproteins to immunoregulation and host defence
 <cit> . mir-146a has been suggested to be involved in negative regulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein- accumulation in macrophages
 <cit> . lipid accumulation in macrophages is associated with the inflammatory processes that lead to atherosclerosis. the expression of mir-146a was found to be down-regulated when thp- <dig> macrophages were stimulated with oxidized ldl. furthermore, mir- <dig> overexpression reduced intracellular ldl cholesterol content and secretion of il <dig>  il <dig>  and mmp <dig> via tlr4-mediated signalling. a similar effect on ldl accumulation was observed by silencing mir- <dig>  another important mirna regulator of immune processes
 <cit> . based on its regulatory role in lipid accumulation mir-146a has been proposed as a potential therapeutic candidate for atherosclerosis treatment
 <cit> . our results support the inhibitory function of mir- <dig> in lipid-mediated inflammatory responses and the proposed application as a therapeutic target.

CONCLUSIONS
recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of mirnas in immune processes and their link to inflammatory disorders and have increased interest to find the molecular pathways responsible for mirna action
 <cit> . mir- <dig> has been recognized as a modulator of the innate and adaptive immune responses in mammals
 <cit> . in a microarray analysis of mirna expression in zebrafish, both of the mir- <dig> family members, mir-146a and mir-146b, were found to be inducible by s. typhimurium and m. marinum infections. the mir- <dig> family members were commonly induced during infections of embryos and adult fish, along with mirnas of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families, which also have been implicated in immunity and infection. the induction of these mirnas in embryo infection models links them specifically with the innate immune response, as adaptive immunity is not yet functional at early developmental stages. we exploited the embryo model as an in vivo system to investigate the role of mir- <dig> in the innate immune response to s. typhimurium infection. induction of mir-146a and mir-146b by infection was shown to be affected by deficiencies in traf <dig> and myd <dig>  which are central intermediates of toll-like receptor and cytokine signalling pathways. mir- <dig> has previously been implicated in negative feed-back regulation of these pathways
 <cit> , similar to a number of signalling proteins, including the protein-tyrosine phosphatase ptpn6
 <cit> . however, whereas knockdown of the ptpn <dig> gene caused hyperinflammation in zebrafish embryos
 <cit> , knockdown of mir- <dig> in the s. typhimurium embryo infection model had no major effect on pro-inflammatory gene expression or on the expression of transcriptional regulators and signal transduction components of known immune response mediators. in contrast, several members of the apolipoprotein gene family  were infection inducible only under mir- <dig> knockdown conditions. the apolipoprotein family has been linked to immunoregulation and host defence in many studies
 <cit> . consistent with a previous report proposing mir-146a as a negative regulator of ldl accumulation in human macrophages and a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis treatment
 <cit> , our results suggest a possible function of mir- <dig> in regulating apolipoprotein-mediated lipid transport under the inflammatory conditions of s. typhimurium infection.
