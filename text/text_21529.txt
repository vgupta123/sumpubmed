BACKGROUND
the class of genes encoding multiple zinc finger  domains is very large in mammals and appears to have expanded on the primate lineage . an accurate picture of patterns of gene duplication and divergence and gene loss is critical for understanding evolution in this gene superfamily. the zf gene complement in the human genome is fairly well established as a result of intensive est and mrna sequencing in humans and detailed hand-curation of a major part of the zf superfamily  <cit> . all other mammalian genomes currently lack both of these advantages, and yet preliminary gene prediction sets are widely available, for example at ncbi and ensembl  and . in the zf superfamily, our unpublished studies show that these predictions frequently miss genes entirely or are obviously incorrect. in the recent paper by tadepally et al.  <cit> , we were struck by some remarkable claims about gene content in the zf family. among these claims are the complete absence of  <dig> human zf genes in the chimpanzee genome  and some dog zf gene predictions encoding huge numbers of zf domains. further investigation showed that the results in the paper appear to be based on available zf gene predictions, and that these predictions are badly flawed.

over half of the zf genes in the human genome also contain an n-terminal krab or scan domain, or both. the krab domain is tetrapod-specific  <cit>  and is nearly always found in zf proteins. the scan domain has a broad distribution in vertebrates and is sometimes present in non-zf proteins  <cit> . tadepally et al.  <cit>  present evidence that addition of the scan domain to zf genes occurred first, followed later by addition of the krab domain to a scan-zf gene. since the large majority of mammalian krab-zf genes lack a scan domain, this inference requires that the scan domain was secondarily lost in most genes.

RESULTS
zf orthologs in chimpanzee
tadepally et al.  <cit>  report that  <dig> of  <dig> human zf genes are missing in the chimpanzee genome assembly and that many others are pseudogenes. given the generally high conservation between human and chimpanzee, this is an extremely surprising result  <cit> . we investigated this pattern for two of the large zf gene clusters on chromosome  <dig>  including the gene cluster analyzed in detail in their figure five. using their nomenclature, these are cluster  <dig>   and cluster  <dig>  . according to our analysis, nearly all of the human proteins in these clusters contain a krab domain . the krab containing subset of the zf superfamily has been carefully hand-curated in the human genome  <cit> . nearly all kznf  genes in humans have a similar exon structure: the entire set of zf domains is encoded on a single long 3' exon and the krab domain is split among one or more short 5' exons  <cit> . typically, 80â€“90% of the final protein is encoded by the zf exon. we took advantage of this fact to identify putative chimpanzee genes based on a simple tblastn method, which works independently of gene predictions. combining results from the two gene clusters, we identified probable chimpanzee orthologs for  <dig> of  <dig> human kznf genes . it is possible that the single missing gene is a result of incomplete sequence coverage in the current chimpanzee genome assembly. our results for cluster  <dig>  are summarized in figure  <dig> and tabular results for both clusters are given in additional file  <dig>  including predicted domain content and genome positions of the putative chimpanzee genes. candidate orthologs for nearly all the human genes were also found in the orangutan genome but were not analyzed in detail . the  <dig> putative chimpanzee orthologs were identified based only on their zf-encoding exon. to test whether these exons are plausibly part of full krab-containing zf genes, we used tblastn to search for orfs that encode the most conserved part of the krab domain.  <dig> of the  <dig> putative chimpanzee zf exons had a potential krab-encoding exon within  <dig> kb upstream . most of the chimpanzee predictions that lacked a nearby krab exon correspond to human genes that are also predicted to lack a krab domain . we also derived full gene models for  <dig> of the chimpanzee genes from cluster  <dig> , nine of which are given as missing in chimpanzee in tadepally et al.  <cit> . all  <dig> predictions aligned with their human counterparts with only a few amino acid changes; one is shown in figure  <dig>  finally, ensembl chimpanzee gene predictions exist for  <dig> of the genes from cluster  <dig>  given as missing or defective in tadepally et al.  <cit> . though we remain uncertain about how many of the  <dig> putative chimpanzee genes from these two gene clusters will prove to be functional, our results are in much better accord with the high degree of overall similarity of the human and chimpanzee genomes. at the very least, sequence corresponding to no more than one of the  <dig> human genes is entirely missing in chimpanzee. we conclude that it remains possible that there is a perfect one-to-one correspondence of zf genes between human and chimpanzee. to facilitate viewing potential zf genes in the chimpanzee genome, we conducted a whole genome profile search and compiled the results as a bed format text file that can be loaded into the ucsc genome browser . the positions of all genomic matches to common zf-associated domains  appear in this track regardless of prediction status. with this track displayed in full, inspection of the chimpanzee genome in the regions corresponding to human zf gene clusters reveals multiple potential zf genes that are currently unpredicted and unannotated.

we used the same methods in a global search for putative chimpanzee orthologs to the zf exon from all  <dig> human kznf genes with good experimental support. strong candidate orthologs were identified for  <dig> of  <dig> genes and incompletely assembled orthologs were identified for another  <dig> genes . the human and chimpanzee proteins encoded by all of these zf exons are provided in additional file  <dig>  including genome coordinates and putative orthology assignments.

zinc finger counts and other genomes
tadepally et al.  <cit>  also report the presence of a zf gene in the dog genome that encodes  <dig> tandem zinc fingers, far more than in any known human gene. further investigation indicated that a number of other dog predictions similarly included unusually large numbers of zf domains . inspection and analysis of the corresponding gene predictions in entrez gene reports showed that these predictions included two or more large zf-encoding exons . for example, the  <dig> zf prediction  spans a  <dig> kb genomic region that includes  <dig> long zf-encoding orfs,  <dig> on the minus strand and  <dig> on the plus strand . parts of most of the minus strand orfs are incorporated into the  <dig> zf prediction, joined by long introns. genome searches with the krab domain revealed that all  <dig> zf-encoding orfs in the region have a potential krab-containing orf close upstream . finally, two of the zf orfs appear to be orthologous to two human kznf genes . we conclude that the single loc <dig> prediction spans a region that likely encodes  <dig> distinct kznf genes. though this degree of inaccuracy in predictions is probably an extreme, it is clear that the dog prediction set cannot be used meaningfully to compare with other genomes. similar problems are likely to affect the mouse and rat prediction sets .

krab and scan domains
in order to assess the evolutionary history of the krab and scan domains with respect to the zf gene family, we used hmmer software  <cit>  to search all proteins in the ensembl prediction sets for takifugu rubripes, xenopus tropicalis, gallus gallus and homo sapiens. figure  <dig> shows the numbers and overlaps of proteins containing these three domains in each species. the scan domain is present in each species except for chicken, consistent with previous evidence suggesting that scan arose in the ancestor of vertebrates and has been lost in chicken  <cit> . in the fish and frog we analyzed, the scan domain is present but is not found in proteins that also contain zf domains. this suggests that the fish, frog and chicken genomes contain no scan-zf genes, although we cannot rule out unpredicted genes with this structure.

the krab domain is present in all three tetrapod species, x. tropicalis, g. gallus and h. sapiens, consistent with previous findings suggesting that the krab domain arose in the ancestor of tetrapod vertebrates  <cit> . among the three species that contain krab domains, all three also contain many krab-zf proteins. the large majority of predicted krab-containing proteins in chicken  and x. tropicalis  are krab-zf proteins that lack a scan domain. we conclude that the association of the krab domain with zf proteins arose in the ancestor of tetrapod vertebrates and therefore predates the association of the scan domain with zf and krab-zf proteins, which is observed only in mammals. this conclusion also parsimoniously explains why the large majority of human krab-zf proteins do not have a scan domain.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that two of the main conclusions of tadepally et al.  <cit>  are questionable. first, we show that the zinc finger gene content of chimpanzee was inadequately assessed, resulting in dramatic overestimates of the number of gene losses on the chimpanzee lineage following its divergence from human. similar difficulties may apply to assessed gene contents of the mouse, dog, and rat genomes. second, we show that the krab domain was probably added to zinc finger genes before the scan domain.
