BACKGROUND
clinically, heating of certain organs or tissues to temperatures between 41°c-46°c  has been effective in tumor therapy. presently, traditional thermotherapy protocols utilize radiofrequency waves, microwaves, or lasers, each of which has many limitations. with the development of nanotechnology, magnetic nanoparticles have been used not only as drug carriers but also in tumor hyperthermia, as such particles absorb energy from high frequency amf. nanoscaled magnetic fluid has been found to absorb much more energy than conventional materials, and this energy is further transferred to tumor cells resulting in tumor temperatures of 42°c-45°c. this process, termed "magnetic fluid hyperthermia " can be used for the treatment of either non-cancer diseases or tumors  <cit> . magnetic nanoparticles may be good thermoseeds for localized hyperthermia treatment of cancers  <cit> , permitting the heating of and damage to normal tissue to be avoided, thus overcoming the limitations of conventional heat treatment. fe2o <dig> magnetic nanoparticles used in mfh were reported to have a significant therapeutic effect on xenograft liver cancer in nude mice  <cit> . depending on the applied temperature and the duration of heating this treatment either results in direct tumor cell killing or makes the cells more susceptible to concomitant radio- or chemotherapy. numerous groups are working in this field worldwide, but only one approach has been tested in clinical trials so far.

metastatic spread of the solid tumor depends on a critical cascade of events, which includes tumor cell adhesion to a distant site, extracellular matrix degradation, migration, proliferation, and ultimately neovascularization. tumors that produce higher levels of metastasis-related factors, such as proteins encoded by the "cluster of differentiation 44v6"  gene, and the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor-c  and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> , may show more aggressive behavior than do tumors negative for these factors. thus, a treatment that could inhibit the expression of these tumor metastasis-related factors would be of great interest.

arsenic is a well-documented carcinogen that also appears to be a valuable therapeutic tool in cancer treatment  <cit> . the first use of as2o <dig> in cancer therapy was to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia   <cit> . the results of in vitro research and clinical trials have shown that as2o <dig> is effective in inhibiting tumor growth, and in inducing the differentiation and apoptosis of apl cells. because of its significant anti-cancer effects, as2o <dig> has been tested in patients with other tumor types, including gastric cancer  <cit> , neuroblastoma  <cit> , esophageal carcinoma  <cit> , and head and neck cancers  <cit> . moreover, as2o <dig> was shown to inhibit tumor metastasis by reducing the expression of metastasis-related genes  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to prepare nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex for tumor thermochemotherapy and validate its effect on xenograft tumor in nude mice as a premature treatment. we also tested the ability of a nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex combined with mfh to inhibit the expression of metastasis-associated genes.

semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chainreaction 
total rna was denaturated for  <dig> min at 70°c. each rt reaction  contained  <dig> μl of total rna, <dig> μl of oligo dt <dig>   <dig> μl of each dntp ,  <dig>  μl rnasin,  <dig> μl amv retroviridase,  <dig> μl  <dig> × amv buffer, and  <dig>  μl of depc water. each reaction mixture was incubated for  <dig> hour at 42°c, and the reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating at 95°c for  <dig> min. each cdna product was frozen at -20°c until use.

RESULTS
characteristics of the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex
the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex particles were approximately spherical, uniform in size, and had good dispersibility, with an average diameter by tem of about  <dig> nm   <cit> . upon dispersion in  <dig> %  nacl and exposure to high frequency amf  for  <dig> min, the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complexes increased the temperature of magnetic fluid  from 42°c to 65°c, depending on the concentration of fe3o <dig> , with a permanent change seen after  <dig> min of electromagnetic exposure. as a  <dig> mg/ml concentration of fe3o <dig> in the as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex increased the mf temperature to 47°c, we chose this fe3o <dig> concentration for further experiments.

in vivo inhibitory effects of the as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex and amf exposure on xenograft cervical cancer in nude mice
following intratumor injection of simple fe3o <dig> magnetic nanoparticles or nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complexes, and exposure to high frequency amf  for  <dig> min, almost the entire tumor got heated by the nanoparticles and the temperature of tumors rose to 44°c-45°c. compared with control tumors, the tumors of all experimental groups were smaller . the mass and volume inhibition rates in the as2o3/fe3o <dig> group were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, significantly higher than observed in the control, the as2o <dig>  and the fe3o <dig> groups . histological examination revealed that, in both the as2o3/fe3o <dig> and fe3o <dig> groups, many black nanoparticles accumulated in the stroma of the tumors, with widespread tumour necrosis surrounding the nanoparticles. the necrotic areas of the as2o <dig> group were larger than those of the control group .

presently, clinical thermotherapy induces substantial damage to surrounding healthy tissues. we applied a multipoint injection strategy, injecting nanoparticles into the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> o'clock points of each tumor, to ensure almost whole tumor to get homogeneously heated and minimize damage to surrounding tissue. thus, because of the targeted and localized thermogenic activity of mfh, normal tissue without magnetic particles should not be damaged. we found that, because of the dual activity  of the nanoparticles, the therapeutic effect of fe3o <dig> magnetic nano-microspheres containing as2o <dig>  in combination with amf exposure, was greater than that of fe3o <dig> magnetic nanoparticles combined with amf exposure, and that of as2o <dig> treatment alone.

discussion
heat therapies such as hyperthermia and thermoablation are very promising approaches in the treatment of cancer. compared with available hyperthermia modalities, mfh yields better results in uniform heating of the deeply situated tumors. in this approach, fluid consisting of superparamagnetic nanoparticles  is delivered to the tumor. an amf is then used to heat the particles and the corresponding tumor, thereby ablating it <cit> . interstitial hyperthermia following direct injection of nanoparticles has also been proven successful in many animal models. jordan a et al. reported good effects of mfh on c3h mammary carcinoma in vivo <cit> . a variety of magnetic fluids have been applied using related techniques , but so far only few of these approaches has been successfully translated from research to clinical stage.

all magnetic nanoparticles used so far in vivo are composed of the iron oxides magnetite  and maghemite  due to their low toxicity and their known pathways of metabolism. as demonstrated by x-ray diffraction, fe3o <dig> nanoparticles are of the spinel type and magnetic fe3o <dig>  <cit>  can absorb a considerable amount of energy and transform this energy into heat when exposed to amf. we successfully prepared nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complexes using co-precipitation and impregnation processes. these particles were successful in the warming of tumors upon exposure to high frequency amf, suggesting their usefulness in hyperthermia protocols. by adjusting the concentration of fe3o <dig>  we could select a suitable temperature  for tumor hyperthermia. at a  <dig> mg/ml fe3o <dig> concentration in the as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex, the temperature of the magnetic fluid rose to 47°c after exposure to high frequency amf for  <dig> min.

nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complexes, combined with mfh, had a significant therapeutic effect on xenograft tumor in nude mice, by inducing tumor cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell growth. we injected complexes directly into the tumor tissue, rather than into healthy tissue at the tumor boundary, thus delivering nanoparticles to the desired regions. such nanoparticles may be internalized into tumor cells and organelles  <cit> , and transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complex particles were indeed so internalized, both into cells and into organelles such as the nucleoli and lysosomes  <cit> . although the mechanism by which nanoparticles enter tumor cells is not yet known, pinocytosis or penetration may be in play, as the nanoparticle diameter is small. moreover, hyperthermia may increase the permeability of biological membranes. these findings suggest that the as2o3/fe3o <dig> composite nanoparticles may be useful as thermoseeds for localized hyperthermia treatment of cancers, without damaging normal tissue, thus overcoming the limitations of conventional heat treatment. moreover, by using these complexes, as2o <dig> can be localized to tumor tissue, thus reducing the as2o <dig> toxicity to normal tissue. this method may therefore allow a combination of localized thermogenic and chemotherapeutic activity, even in tumors located deep inside the body, simultaneously minimizing damage caused by heat and toxicity to normal tissue surrounding the tumor. the mfh also can act as a temperature control switch in vivo by controlling the concentration of fe3o <dig>  thus minimizing the risk of overheating during therapy. in comparison with traditional hyperthermia, the double function  and targeted activity of the combination of nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complexes and mfh are most important characteristics. based on the data in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  although the tumor inhibition appears to be primarily due to the heat, we can still see that the combination was more effective than either fe3o <dig> magnetic nanoparticles plus mfh, or as2o <dig> treatment alone. in addition, the heat created during thermotherapy may directly damage tumor cells or may make cells more susceptible to accompanying chemotherapy  <cit> .

mfh has been undergoing clinical testing. in three clinical studies the safety and the feasibility of the technique has been proven. in march  <dig>  the first clinical feasibility study on magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia was started with  <dig> patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme  <cit> . all patients received a neuro-navigationally guided injection of the magnetic fluid into the tumor. the amount of fluid and the spatial distribution of the depots were planned in advance by means of a specially developed treatment planning software following magnetic resonance imaging . the actually achieved magnetic fluid distribution was measured by computed tomography .

in prostate cancer, a direct injection technique of mfh was investigated in phase-i-study. the feasibility and good tolerability was shown in the trial <cit> . this novel approach requires specific tools for planning, quality control and thermal monitoring, based on appropriate imaging and modelling techniques. treatment planning was carried out using ct of the prostate. nanoparticle suspensions were injected transperineally into the prostate under transrectal ultrasound and flouroscopy guidance.

another prospective feasibility study enrolled  <dig> patients with proven recurrences and residual tumors  <cit> . three implantation methods were established: infiltration under ct fluoroscopy , trus --guided implantation with x-fluoroscopy  and intra-operative infiltration under visual control . in group a and b the distribution of the nanoparticles can be planned prior to implantation on the basis of three-dimensional image datasets. these approaches of mfh above were well tolerated by patients.

mfh is suitable for treatment of superficial tumors by direct injection of nanoparticle suspension, which was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> . for deep tumors, the feasibility and good tolerability of different injection techniques  were shown. endoscope such as oesophagoscope and vaginoscope can be respectively used as guiding devices for esophageal cancer and cervical cancer. a different approach of using magnetic nanoparticles for heating tumor cells is termed ferromagnetic embolization hyperthermia. this technique, which uses a feeding artery to carry nanoparticles into the tumor, seems to be especially well suited for the treatment of hepatic malignancies due to the differences in blood supply between hepatic tumor cells and normal liver parenchyma. several preclinical studies on arterial embolization hyperthermia of liver cancer were reported  <cit> , and granov reported this treatment on clinical use <cit> .

metastasis, a unique characteristic of malignant tumors, is the most difficult issue in the clinical treatment of cancer and the major cause of death. hyperthermia may trigger immune responses that inhibit the metastasis of graft tumors  <cit> .

"cluster of differentiation 44"  is a cell surface adhesion molecule that recognizes hyaluronate and mediates diverse functions, such as cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, lymphocyte homing, and t-cell adhesion and activation. cd <dig> exists as a standard form  and as multiple isoforms, each generated by alternative splicing of up to  <dig> variant exons encoding parts of the extracellular domain. cd <dig>  especially the cd44v <dig> variant, has a role in tumor progression and metastasis in human cancers  <cit> . expression of cd44v <dig> has been found to correlate significantly with lymphatic and/or hematogenous metastasis. following the administration of as2o <dig> to sgc <dig> cells, expression of cd <dig> decreased, suggesting that as2o <dig> inhibited cd <dig> expression  <cit> .

in the vascular endothelial growth factor  family, vegf-c is a ligand for vegf receptor - <dig>  a tyrosine kinase receptor that is predominantly expressed in the endothelium of lymphatic vessels. vegf-c plays an important role in tumor metastasis by mediating the formation of lymphatic vessels. most cancer cells express vegf-c, and such expression positively correlates with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis  <cit> . as2o <dig> has been reported to inhibit vegf expression, preventing the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of solid tumors  <cit> . in addition, expression of vegf mrna and protein by fibrosarcomas was significantly inhibited after thermotherapy at 42°c  <cit> . moreover, the density of tumor vessels in gliomas was reduced after thermotherapy and even more after thermochemotherapy, indicating that thermotherapy may inhibit the expression of vegf mrna and protein  <cit> .

matrix metalloproteinases  are a family of zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagen. mmps mediate the invasive properties of most malignant cells and promote angiogenesis through their ability to degrade basement membranes and to remodel extracellular matrix architecture. in particular, mmp- <dig> specifically degrades collagen iv, the major component of the basement membrane. expression of mmp- <dig> has been found to correlate with tumor invasiveness and metastasis, including lymph node metastasis <cit> . as2o <dig> reduced the expression of mmp- <dig> by nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells in vitro, and decreased their invasive and metastatic properties  <cit> . using as2o3/fe3o <dig> nanoparticles, we found that as2o <dig> dose-dependently inhibited the expression of cd44v <dig>  vegf-c, and mmp- <dig> mrna. moreover, thermotherapy alone inhibited the expression of vegf-c mrna to some extent.

CONCLUSIONS
the nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complexes described here possess not only the chemotherapeutic activity of as2o <dig> but also the characteristic of strong magnetic responsiveness arising from the presence of fe3o <dig>  these particles are suitable for treating superficial tumors by direct injection and for deep tumors by using different injection techniques , because they absorb energy from high frequency amf and also have chemotherapeutic effects. for early stage tumors, thermochemotherapy of nanosized as2o3/fe3o <dig> complexes could be used as preoperative treatment because of reducing tumor volume and intraoperative bleeding, creating better conditions for latter surgery. in addition, it may be can inhibit tumor metastasis to some extent.

most researches of mfh in this field applied so far have only been evaluated in preclinical studies. in spite of some phase i trials have been carried out, it is still too early to claim therapeutic advantages for the applied method because survival benefit or time to progression were not defined endpoints of the finished feasibility studies. however, the ongoing phase ii trials will provide an initial indication whether mfh can improve survival and/or quality of life.
