BACKGROUND
influenza viruses occur all over the world and cause significant morbidity and mortality  <cit> . the surface proteins hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase  are the primary targets of the protective immune system. in circulating influenza viruses, gradually accumulated mutations on the ha, which interacts with infectivity-neutralizing antibodies, lead to the escape of immune system . the antibody recognition of ha is highly correlated to the conformation changes on the antigenic sites . to quantify a changed epitope escaping from neutralizing antibodies is the basis to study the antigenic drift for the vaccine development  <cit> .

most of methods measuring the antigenic variances on ha focused on amino acid position mutations, such as hamming distance  <cit>  or phylogenic distance  <cit> . an antibody often utilized complementarily-determining regions  to bind two specific sites  on the antigen   <cit> . the ha consists of five epitopes and each epitope has ~ <dig> structural neighbour amino acids locating on the protein surface  <cit> . recently, few studies discussed the relationships between the epitopes and vaccine efficiency  <cit> .

here, we have proposed a method to identify the antigenic drift of influenza a by quantifying the conformation change of an epitope. our method is able to predict antigenic variants of a given pair ha sequences which are often a vaccine strain and a circulating strain. our model was evaluated to measure the antigenic drifts and vaccine updates on  <dig>  circulating strains  and to predict the antigenic variants on two data sets . these results demonstrate that our model is able to reflect the biological meanings and can explain the selections of who vaccine strains.

materials and methods
changed epitopes
the changed epitope is the core of our method. here, we defined a changed epitope as follows: an antigenic site  on ha with accumulated amino acid mutations induces the conformation change to escape from the neutralizing antibody. the conformation change of a mutation depends on its position on ha structure and the mutation rate during  <dig> years. a changed epitope can be considered as a "key feature" for measuring antigenic variants of a pair ha sequences. here, a changed epitope can be used to predict antigenic variants and antigenic drifts for the selections of vaccine strains. the definition of five epitopes including  <dig> positions was proposed by wilson et al. <cit>  and bush et al. <cit> .

data sets
to describe and evaluate the ability of the changed epitopes for predicting antigenic variants, we collected hemagglutination inhibition  assays, describing the antigenic variants and similar viruses of the current global influenza surveillance system. the hi assay describes whether one  strain will be recognized by an antibody against the vaccine strain. we collected  <dig> h3n <dig> virus hi assays  with  <dig> ha sequences from weekly epidemiological record   <cit> , world health organization  collaborating center  <cit>  and related publications  <cit>  . each pair includes the hi assay value  and a pair of ha sequences . in general, an influenza vaccine should be updated if an antigenic distance is more than  <dig>  between the current vaccine strain and the circulating strain in next season  <cit>  <cit> . among  <dig> pairs of ha sequences,  <dig> pairs with antigenic distance ≥  <dig> are considered as "antigenic variants" and  <dig> pairs are considered as "similar viruses". for example, the antigenic distance of the pair ha sequences, a/england/42/ <dig> and a/portchalmers/1/ <dig>  is  <dig> and this pair is considered as "antigenic variants". conversely, the antigenic distance of the pair ha sequences, a/wuhan/359/ <dig> and a/nanchang/933/ <dig>  is  <dig> and this pair is considered as "similar viruses". in addition, we prepared another hi assay data set to independently evaluate our model for predicting antigenic variants proposed by smith et al. <cit> . we assume that a virus-pair in the same antigenic group is considered as a "similar viruses" pair and a virus-pair in different groups is considered as "antigenic variants" pair. finally, we yielded  <dig>  hi measurements from the supporting materials  <cit> .

to study the antigenic drifts and who vaccine updates, we collected  <dig>  ha sequences  from influenza virus resource  <cit>  and influenza sequence database  <cit> . these sequences were assigned into  <dig> influenza seasons according to their collection dates.

identify antigenic critical positions on ha
recently, we proposed a method to identify antigenic critical positions  <cit>  by utilizing both antigenic variants and genetic diversity. the shannon entropy and information gain  were used to measure genetic diversity and antigenic discriminating score for amino acid positions on ha, respectively. here, we based on these rules to select  <dig> amino acid positions as the critical positions .

models for antigenic variants based on changed epitopes
to address the issue of measuring accumulated mutations on an epitope to escape from neutralizing antibody, we proposed  <dig> models considering the number of amino acid mutations on  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> selected critical positions of ha . models one and two regarded an epitope as "changed" if there are more than  <dig> and  <dig> mutations within an epitope, respectively, based on  <dig> amino acids. a changed epitope of model three is defined as two amino acid mutations on  <dig> critical positions. models one, two, and three regarded a pair ha sequences as "antigenic variants" if there are more than two changed epitopes. conversely, one changed epitope is viewed as "similar viruses".

model four treated one changed epitope  as "antigenic variants". epitopes a and b, which are near to the receptor binding site, often play the key role for escaping from neutralizing antibody. here, the epitopes a and b  were regarded as "changed" if there are more than  <dig> and  <dig> mutations, respectively. for the pair a/mississippi/1/ <dig> and a/leningrad/360/ <dig> , the numbers of mutations were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> on epitopes a, b, c, d and e, respectively. the numbers of changed epitopes for models one and two are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. models three and four regarded the epitope b as a changed epitope because these three mutations  were the selected critical positions.

 <dig> bold is the antigenic critical position.

finally, we compared our models with two related methods  <cit>  for predicting antigenic variants. wilson & cox  <cit>  suggested that a viral variant usually contains more than  <dig> residue mutations located on at least two of the five epitopes. lee & chen  <cit>  proposed a model based on the hamming distance  of  <dig> positions on five epitopes to predict antigenic variants. their models predicted a pair of ha sequences as "antigenic variants" if the number of mutation is more than  <dig> 

variant ratio for measuring the antigenic drift
we used the variant ratio  to measure the vaccine efficiency on year y. the vr is defined as , where ny is total number of circulating strains in the year y and vy is the number of circulating strains which are "antigenic variants" against the vaccine strain in the year. here, we considered an influenza vaccine should be updated and the antigenic variants are emerging if the vr value is ≥  <dig> .

RESULTS
antigenic critical positions
in this study, we followed our previous work to select the critical positions  <cit>  having high igs, statistically derived from  <dig> hi assays, and high entropies, which were calculated using  <dig> ha sequences.  <dig> positions on ha were selected as critical positions . among these  <dig> critical positions,  <dig> positions locate on the epitopes  and  <dig> positions locate on the ha surface . additionally,  <dig> and  <dig> of these  <dig> critical positions were the positive selections  <cit>  and cluster substitutions  <cit> , respectively.

changed epitopes for antigenic variants
currently, several methods measured a changed epitope to escape from neutralizing antibody  <cit> . here, we utilized the degree of accumulated mutations within an epitope to evaluate a changed epitope according to  <dig> positions and  <dig> selected positions. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the relationships between changed epitopes and antigenic variants on  <dig> models.

models one and two: changed epitopes on  <dig> positions
figures 2a  and 2b  show the relationships between number of changed epitopes and "antigenic variants" on  <dig> pair ha sequences with hi assays. among these  <dig> pairs for model one, the changed epitopes of  <dig> "antigenic variants" pairs range from  <dig> to  <dig> and the changed epitopes of  <dig> "similar viruses" pairs range from  <dig> to  <dig>  among  <dig> similar viruses with more than  <dig> changed epitopes for model one, we observed the following results:  the average number of changed epitopes was  <dig> ;  the average number of changed epitopes with only one mutation was  <dig>  and  <dig> pairs have more than one changed epitope with only one mutation. for example, the virus pair, a/portchalmers/1/ <dig> and a/singapore/4/ <dig>  has four changed epitopes with one mutation  . in general, these  <dig> similar viruses should be regarded as "antigenic variants" because there are more than four changed epitopes. this result shows that the model one is not reasonable.

for model two, the average number of changed epitopes was  <dig>  for these  <dig> similar viruses.  according to the distribution , model two achieved the highest accuract if more that two changed epitopes was considered as "antigenic variants".  the accuracies were  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for predicting antigenic variants on the training set and independent set, respectively.  this result was similar to the previous work  <cit> .

model three: changed epitopes on  <dig> selected positions
model three considered a changed epitope when the number of mutations on the  <dig> selected critical positions is more than  <dig>  in model two, the numbers of "antigenic variants" and "similar viruses" with ≥  <dig> changed epitopes were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the averages of changed epitopes with ≥  <dig> mutations on  <dig> positions for "antigenic variants" and "similar viruses" were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the averages of changed epitopes with ≥  <dig> mutations on  <dig> selected critical positions for "antigenic variants" and "similar viruses" were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . these results show that model three using mutations on  <dig> critical positions is better than model two to discriminate "antigenic variants" from "similar viruses". for the "similar viruses", a/alaska/10/ <dig> and a/france/75/ <dig>  there are  <dig> mutations to drive zero changed epitope because no epitope with ≥  <dig> mutations on selected  <dig> positions .

three ha/antibody complex structures can be used to provide structural evidences for the changed epitopes  <cit>  . among these complexes, two antibodies bind to epitopes a and b , while the third binds to epitopes c and e . the antibodies consistently bind to two epitopes and this result agrees to models two and three. ha/antibody structures and models two and three show that two position mutations often induce the conformational change of an epitope to escape from the antibody recognition. however, the numbers of changed epitopes of  <dig> "similar viruses" pairs are  <dig>  and  <dig>  for model two . conversely,  <dig> "similar viruses" pairs have more than  <dig> changed epitopes for model three .

model four
among  <dig> "antigenic variants" pairs with one changed epitope based on model three,  <dig> pairs change on epitopes a or b. the single changed epitope on a or b, which can cause "antigenic variants", agreed to ha/antibody complex structures and the experiments. the receptor binding site, surrounded by epitopes a and b, is a basis for ha protein for the neutralizing mechanism  <cit>  .

based on this observation, the epitopes a and b play a key role for neutralizing antibodies. model four based on model three considered a pair ha sequences as "antigenic variants" when ≥  <dig> changed epitopes or ≥  <dig> changed epitope on a or b. in model four, a pair ha sequences with ≥  <dig> mutations on  <dig> critical positions for the epitope b is regarded as "antigenic variants". thus, we annotated a virus-pairs with single changed epitope on a or b as "1+" type . for example, the pair, a/guizhou/54/ <dig> and a/beijing/353/ <dig>  occurs the changed epitope on a  . the accuracies of model four were  <dig> % and  <dig> % on the training set and independent set, respectively. this model outperformed two compared methods, i.e. wilson & cox   <cit>  and lee & chen   <cit> , on the independent data set .

in the ha/antibody structure complex , the antibody binds on epitopes a and b using two cdrs  on the heavy chain and one cdr  on the light chain . the interface of antibody and ha consists of  <dig> and  <dig> contacted residues locating on epitopes b and a, respectively. among these  <dig> positions,  <dig> positions were selected as critical positions. based on model four,  <dig> "antigenic variants" pairs have one changed epitope b with  <dig> mutations on epitope b, denoted as "b+". this result suggested a single changed epitope b can cause antigenic variants. for example, the pair virus strains, a/newyork/55/ <dig> and a/anhui/1239/ <dig>  have three critical mutations on epitope b  . according to the ha/antibody structure , the residue  <dig> interacts to cdr <dig>  and the residue  <dig> interacts with three residues on cdr <dig>  and one residue on cdr <dig> . this structure suggested that mutations on residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> can induce the conformation change on epitope b to escape from cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> of the neutralizing antibody.

antigenic drift and epitope evolution
we utilized the changed epitopes to study the antigenic drift on  <dig>  circulating strains ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . one of who surveillance network's purposes is to detect the emergence and spread of antigenic variants that may signal a need to update the composition of influenza vaccine  <cit> . here, we considered an emerging antigenic variant according to wer strain, which was the dominant strain in each influenza season  <cit>  . for a selected season, we applied model four, measuring changed epitopes for the pairs between the vaccine and circulating strains for "antigenic variants", and the variant ratio  to detect the emerging antigenic variants.

among  <dig> seasons , our model detected  <dig> seasons with emerging antigenic variants  and  <dig> of them followed by the update of wer strain in the next season . for example, the 85- <dig> season, 80% of the circulating strains with changed epitope "b+" , is the first emerging antigenic variants and the wer strain updated in the next season . in addition, among seven "emerging antigenic variants" seasons , four seasons  matched the antigenic cluster transitions proposed by smith et al.  <cit> . the other three seasons, which were detected by one changed epitope on a or b, are consistent to the wer strain updates . these results suggested that "emerging antigenic variants" with ≥  <dig> changed epitopes may cause the major antigenic drift while "emerging antigenic variants" with one changed epitope on a or b may cause the minor antigenic drift.

to observe the epitope evolution, figure 5b illustrates the hamming distance  on  <dig> critical positions of five epitopes. for example, the vr of the season 85- <dig> was  <dig>   and the epitope with the largest hd was epitope b . for  <dig> seasons with wer strain updates, the average hds of epitopes a, b, c, d and e were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. these results showed that epitopes a and b change more frequently in vaccine update seasons and they play a key role for antigenic drift.

discussion
according to the distribution of antigenic variants of model four , it is interesting that the major pairs  of the antigenic variants have the changed epitope on epitopes a or b which are closed to the receptor binding site. furthermore, many experiments suggested that the occlusion of the receptor binding site by antibodies bound to the ha molecule forms the dominant neutralizing mechanism  <cit> . these results implied that a pair of viruses often is "similar virus" if the epitopes a and b are not changed.

among  <dig> "antigenic variants" pairs,  <dig> pairs have no changed epitopes .  <dig> pairs of these  <dig> pairs have contradict antigenic types by two antiseras, which suggested a more powerful experimental assay is required to verify the antigenic types. for example, the antibody against the a/alaska/10/ <dig> strain can't inhibit the a/idaho/4/ <dig> strain; while the antibody against the a/idaho/4/ <dig> strain inhibits the a/alaska/10/ <dig> strain.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates our model is robust and feasible for quantifying the changed epitopes. according to the distribution of antigenic variants in hi assays and ha/antibody complex structures, we found that two critical position mutations with high genetic diversity and antigenic scores can induce the conformation change of an epitope. epitopes a and b, closing the receptor binding site of ha, play a key role for neutralizing antibodies. in addition, two changed epitopes often drive the antigenic drift and can be used to explain the selections of  <dig> who vaccine strains. we believe that our method is useful for the vaccine development and studying the evolution of human influenza a virus.
