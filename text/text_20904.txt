BACKGROUND
anopheles funestus and anopheles gambiae are the major malaria vectors in africa. due to the difficulty of laboratory colonization, an. funestus has not received the same attention as an. gambiae and as a consequence there are few molecular markers for this species. however, the recent successful colonization of two strains of an. funestus  <cit>  and the identification of a number of microsatellite markers  <cit>  have facilitated more detailed studies of this species. microsatellite markers particularly have been used to study population structure and gene flow between an. funestus populations  <cit>  and a subset of these microsatellite markers were used to build the first linkage map of this species  <cit> . however, microsatellite markers are not evenly distributed across the genome, and their low number so far is an obstacle to the development of high resolution linkage maps needed for qtl mapping or association studies in an. funestus. therefore, this study was initiated to increase the availability of characterized and mapped markers for an. funestus. physically mapped ests were used to identify snps. such ests have been used to study the genetic variability in a number of species such as aedes aegypti, drosophila melanogaster or homo sapiens  <cit>  and should be a source of dna polymorphisms for an. funestus as well.

single nucleotide polymorphisms  are by far the most common type of molecular variation in all organisms. they are extremely abundant with an occurrence of about one snp per kb in human  <cit>  and about one snp every  <dig> bp in an. gambiae  <cit> . significant progress has been made in the development of tools for detection and genotyping of snps and they are now becoming the markers of choice for association studies, high-resolution linkage mapping and population genomics studies  <cit> . snps located in non-coding regions of the genome and synonymous snps  in coding regions, which have no impact on the phenotype, may provide useful markers for population genetics studies. non-synonymous snps  which alter the structure  and potentially the function of encoded proteins are useful markers for association studies to detect genetic variations linked with phenotypic traits.

patterns of genetic diversity in an. funestus have not been studied to the same extent as in an. gambiae or drosophila species. nucleotide diversity in these species has been used to compare patterns of nucleotide variation, such as the relative occurrence of transitions/tranversions in different regions of the genome  <cit> . these surveys have established codon usage and usage bias patterns in many species, with bias hypothesized to occur as a result of selection for efficient translation  <cit> .

the sequencing of the  <dig> million base pairs  constituting the an. gambiae genome has revealed more than  <dig>  snps indicating a high level of polymorphism in mosquito species  <cit> . we hypothesize that by sequencing dna fragments of different genes of an. funestus, a similar level of polymorphism should be encountered and will allow the identification of a significant set of snps.

here, we describe the detection and characterization of a set of genome-wide snp markers from  <dig> nuclear genes using two laboratory strains and field samples of an. funestus. we also examined patterns of polymorphism and nucleotide diversity in coding and non-coding regions of the genome and define the pattern of codon usage in an. funestus. the utility of the snps was assessed by genotyping a subset of these snps during a linkage mapping study.

RESULTS
gene amplification
in total,  <dig> primer pairs were tested by pcr,  <dig> of which gave reliable amplification with pcr products ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. sequence data from a total of  <dig> specimens of an. funestus was obtained for  <dig> of these genes  from laboratory and field samples. overall, we sequenced a total of  <dig>  bp consisting of  <dig>  bp of coding region and  <dig>  bp of non-coding region. we identified  <dig> snps consisting of  <dig> coding snps  and  <dig> non-coding snps. each gene contained at least one polymorphism with bu <dig> having one and bu <dig> having  <dig>  the distribution of snps among the  <dig> genes is presented in table  <dig>  all information concerning the location and the nature of each individual snp have been submitted to dbsnp, the snp database of genbank. these snps with their respective reference snp number  are publicly available in dbsnp build n° <dig>  the ncbi ss  numbers of these snps are ss <dig> to ss <dig> 

type of polymorphism
for all sequenced dna fragments, transition substitutions were more predominant than transversions . transitions c↔t and a↔g are over-represented with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total substitutions respectively while the four transversion classes occurred at similar levels . the higher frequency of c↔t and a↔g snps is probably partly related to 5-methylcytosine deamination reactions that occur frequently, particularly at cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . the preponderance of transitions is more obvious for coding regions where out of the  <dig> snps identified,  <dig> were transitions  and  <dig> were transversions . the ratio of transitions/transversions observed here is close to the  <dig> :  <dig> ratio observed for drosophila and humans  <cit> . for polymorphism in non-coding regions, transitions accounted for 55%  and transversion for 45% . the frequency of transitions between coding and non-coding regions were significantly different . this confirms that snps occur more frequently as transitions in coding regions than in non-coding regions. there is also a higher frequency of snps occurring at the third codon position  than at the 1st or 2nd position . similar results have been observed for aedes aegypti  <cit>  and in three species of drosophila  <cit> . the degeneracy of the genetic code and the selective pressure for gene conservation have been suggested as the main reasons for the preponderance of transitions over transversions  <cit> . synonymous or silent substitutions are more often transitions than transversions and there is a stronger selection against replacement substitutions than against synonymous, leading to an increase of the relative frequency of transitions  <cit> . for fourfold degenerate codons, selection should be neutral, since no amino acid change is induced by a nucleotide substitution at the third position, and each of the  <dig> codons will produce the same amino acid. we tested this hypothesis by comparing the proportions of transversions at fourfold degenerate codon positions and at non-coding positions for all the  <dig> genes . the result shows that there is no significant difference between the frequency of transversions at fourfold degenerate codon positions  and at non-coding regions  , while this difference is significant between coding and non-coding regions . the fact that fourfold degenerate sites have a similar ratio of transitions/tranversions to non-coding regions is consistent with an hypothesis that the structure of the genetic code and selection against replacement polymorphisms accounts for the preponderance of transition substitutions in coding regions.

five insertion/deletion polymorphisms  were observed in four genes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in coding, intronic and 5'utr regions . two indels of  <dig> and  <dig> bp were observed in the bu <dig> intron. the frequency of indels  is lower than that reported in ae aegypti of 24%  <cit>  or 25% in an. gambiae  <cit> . only one indel, in the bu <dig> gene, was located in a coding region. this indel was a triplet that did not cause a frame shift. the four indels identified can serve as molecular makers for mapping studies.

approximately 2/ <dig>  of the  <dig> csnps were synonymous substitutions  while around 1/ <dig>  were non-synonymous or replacement snps leading to a change of amino acid. as approximately two-thirds of random coding substitutions change an amino acid, the fact that only 1/ <dig> of csnps are non-synonymous implies strong selection against changes that alter amino acid. this ratio of synonymous and replacement csnps is similar to that observed in an. gambiae  <cit>  and ae. aegypti  <cit> .

genetic diversity
we estimated the nucleotide diversity for each of the  <dig> genes in coding and non-coding regions . the average nucleotide diversity per gene in coding regions was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> or around  <dig> snp every  <dig> bp similar to that observed in an. gambiae   <cit>  but much higher than the frequency of  <dig> snp/kb observed in humans  <cit> . snps were observed in non-coding regions at a frequency of  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp, corresponding to π =  <dig> × 10- <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that there is a positive correlation in the level of polymorphism between coding and non coding regions of an. funestus genome within a gene . this positive correlation may be the consequence of many factors notably the correlated genealogies existing between coding regions and their surrounding non-coding regions. this correlation may also be strengthened by the presence of indirect selection  and probably by variable recombination rate, as it is the case in drosophila  <cit> . mutational effect of recombination or biased gene conversion can also operate, but this needs to be confirmed as even in drosophila, the effect of biased gene conversion is only suspected but unwarranted  <cit> . the average nucleotide diversity in non-coding dna  was lower than in synonymous sites of the coding regions , p <  <dig> . this pattern was also observed in an gambiae, ae aegypti and drosophila species  <cit> . this is an indication that non-coding regions are under greater purifying selection than synonymous sites within coding regions. this is not surprising, given that non-coding regions may be involved in gene regulation. the non-coding 5'-flanking sequence of a gene may contain regulatory elements such as the promoter that control the expression of that gene, and single-base mutations can affect essential structures for splicing and processing  <cit> .

nucleotide diversity varies greatly from one gene to another  and this is likely related to individual gene function and potentially to differences in selective constraints. however, non-synonymous diversities need to be compared in order to definitely estimate the influence of differences in selective constraints. among the most polymorphic genes sequenced were cytochrome p <dig> genes, lysozyme, translation initiation factor and ubiquitin conjugating genes. the non-synonymous nucleotide diversity of these genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  most of these genes are involved in specific mechanisms that evolve very rapidly, such as detoxification of xenobiotics for cytochrome p450s or defense mechanisms against bacteria like lysozyme. for example, p450s present a high level of redundancy with less genetic constraints and therefore more polymorphism. in contrast some genes showed very low level of variation particularly those involved in transcriptional or translational regulation  or in signaling processes . examples of selective constraints have been observed as well in drosophila spp. where substitution rate between conservative genes and fast evolving genes differ by around 10-fold  <cit> . nucleotide diversity was not statistically different between laboratory strains and field collected mosquitoes , despite an apparent low level of heterozygosity  observed in the two laboratory strains compared to the field sample. this result could be due to the fact that fumoz and fang , were only recently colonized in laboratory and therefore still largely retain the polymorphism of natural populations of an. funestus.

the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous changes  gives an indication of the magnitude of the purifying selection against deleterious mutations in a species. the rate of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per non-synonymous site  is generally expected to be much lower than the rate of synonymous substitution per synonymous site , because random amino acid changes are usually deleterious, whereas synonymous changes are likely to be neutral or nearly so  <cit> . thus, the expectation is ka << ks, except when positive selection is involved favouring particular amino acid replacements, in which case ka will increase. for an. funestus the ka/ks ratio was equal to  <dig>  and is similar to the ratio of  <dig>  observed in an. gambiae  <cit>  or  <dig>  in ae. aegypti  <cit>  but, higher than the ratio of  <dig>  reported in d. melanogaster  <cit> . this result indicates that the purifying selection against deleterious mutations is acting in an. funestus. indeed species with large effective population size such drosophila or anopheles species are generally more effective at purging deleterious mutations  <cit> .

clustering pattern of the snps
we analyzed the distribution of snps identified in this study. we found  <dig> clusters of two directly neighboring snps, one cluster of  <dig> consecutive snps and  <dig> clusters of two snps separated by just  <dig> bp. for some snp genotyping methods based on allele-specific amplification, ligation or single base extension principles for which primers need to be designed immediately adjacent to the snp, it is important that the snps are not too close together to prevent primer designing. the presence of a polymorphism within approximately  <dig> bp will limit the possibilities for designing a robust primer. most of the  <dig> snps identified in this study do not have a snp within  <dig> bp on either or one side thus, and should be easily genotyped by one of these methods.

genomic position of the snps
among the  <dig> genes amplified for snp detection in this study,  <dig> are already physically mapped to the an. funestus genome by in situ hybridization  <cit> , and the remaining  <dig> genes were genetically located to their respective chromosome by linkage mapping  <cit> . overall,  <dig> snps were located on the x chromosome,  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  the higher number of snps observed on chromosome  <dig> is also a consequence of the fact that most of the studied genes are located on that chromosome. table  <dig> gives the chromosomal location of the  <dig> genes across the genome of an. funestus.

polymorphism reliability
to assess the validity of the snps identified in this study,  <dig> snps were tested for segregation in isofemale lines. these snps were tested using different methods   <cit> . the mendelian segregation ratio of each of these snp loci at f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> generations was examined in four families from reciprocal crosses between a pyrethroid resistant strain  and a susceptible strain . homozygous and heterozygous genotypes for each of these snps were observed. importantly, the expected mendelian ratio of 1:2: <dig> was respected in  <dig> of these  <dig> snps  <cit> , confirming the polymorphism observed at these different positions. we can conclude from this result that the snps described in this study are then likely to be true polymorphisms rather than sequence artifacts and our scoring results indicate that they are suitable for use as genetic markers.

relevance of the snps
the set of snps identified in this study provide a very useful tool for future genetic studies in an. funestus. these markers are of immediate use for association and qtl mapping studies. some of these snps have been used for linkage mapping and identification of qtl involved in pyrethroid resistance in an. funestus  <cit> . this set of snps can be used as tools for population genetic studies in an. funestus. genotyping large number of snp markers will facilitate the study of genetic structure of natural populations and provide independent estimates of gene flow. it may provide additional markers to study the speciation process observed between the folonzo and kiribina chromosomal forms of an. funestus  <cit> . these markers may also be invaluable in monitoring insecticide resistance genes or genes involved in vector competence.

CONCLUSIONS
through the sequencing of dna fragments from  <dig> genes of an. funestus, we identified a set of  <dig> snp markers and studied the pattern of genetic variability in this species. the distribution of snps in an. funestus was not neutral but under the influence of regional factors such as recombination, the degeneracy of the genetic code and selective constraints for gene conservation. the snp markers described constitutes an important resource for more genetic studies in this important malaria vector.
