BACKGROUND
thermophilic microorganisms are gaining big industrial and biotechnological interest due to their enzymes  remaining active in harsh industrial processes  <cit> . the industrial demand for the thermozymes continues to stimulate the search for novel thermophilic microorganisms from various unexplored regions of the earth, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, terrestrial geothermal springs and mudpots  <cit> .

one of the important groups of biotechnologically relevant enzymes are lipases , which have found large applications in food, diary, detergent, and pharmaceutical industries  <cit> . lipases catalyse the hydrolysis of ester bonds of triacylglycerol at the interface between an insoluble substrate and water. in non-aqueous media these reactions are reversed due to a hydrophobic domain , covering the active site of the lipase. the three-dimensional structures of lipases have shown their association with the α/β hydrolase family which contain terminal α-helices and a central β-sheet including the active ser placed in a loop termed the catalytic elbow  <cit> . most of α/β hydrolases contain consensus sequence gly-x-ser-x-gly around the active site serine, with a catalytic triad .

lipase coding genes have been reported in wide range of microorganisms, however lipases derived from thermophiles have privileges compared to the mesophilic lipases due to their unique attributes  <cit> . thermophilic bacilli are the natural source of many thermostable enzymes, among them the thermostable lipases which have received great attention in both structural studies and industrial applications as they show high stability at elevated temperatures and in organic solvents  <cit> . however, only a small numbers of lipase producing thermophilic microbes have been reported in the last decade. thus, the screening for new thermostable lipase producers has become a very important task  <cit> .

thermophilic microorganisms appear in a big list of taxonomic groups and are located on different phylogenetic distances throughout the taxonomic trees of microorganisms  <cit> . among the huge diversity of thermophilic bacteria mainly bacilli have been reported as active thermostable lipase producers . number of thermophilic bacilli species belonging to the genera bacillus, geobacillus and anoxybacillus have been isolated from different geotherms and reported as thermostable lipase producers .

it is shown recently that armenian geothermal springs harboured thermophilic microbes from different taxonomic groups including thermophilic endospore-forming bacteria . despite this progress very little is known about the diversity of lipase producers thriving in armenian geothermal springs.

the present study focuses on isolation and identification lipase-producing thermophilic bacilli from geothermal springs of armenia  and nagorno-karabakh  as well as comparative analysis of their lipase encoding genes’ sequences.

RESULTS
isolation and phenotypic characterisation
collected three sediment samples were analysed to evaluate the lipase producing aerobic thermophilic endospore-forming bacterial abundance in armenian geothermal springs. in total forty-one chemoorganotrophic thermophilic aerobic lipase-producer bacilli strains were isolated from akhourik, tatev and karvachar geothermal springs. three most active producers of which designated as akhourik  <dig>  tatev  <dig> and karvachar qb <dig> were selected and further characterized. all of the isolates were routinely maintained at 4 °c on nb agar slants.

selected lipase-producing isolates were characterized by their phenotypic properties. on solid nb medium isolates differ by colony form, colour and surface, thus they form light yellow, white or creamy, circular, smooth or transparent colonies with  <dig> –2 mm diameter. the isolates were gram positive, endospore forming motile rods varying in length between  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm and in width between  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm .table  <dig> some phenotypic characteristics of the studied isolates

all isolates were facultative anaerobic and have shown ability to grow in wide range of temperature and ph. the optimal growth temperature values of studied isolates varied from 55 °c – 65 °c. isolate akhourik  <dig> is also able to grow under 37 °c which clearly shows the strain to be thermotolerant. bacterial isolates grow optimally at ph  <dig>  except for karvachar qb <dig>  which grows optimally at ph  <dig> .

the highest tolerance towards nacl content in the media was measured for akhurik  <dig> . other isolates have tolerated 2– <dig> % of sodium chloride concentrations and have shown optimal growth in 0–3% nacl content in media.

the strain akhourik  <dig> was positive according to voges-proskauer test, while others were negative. the isolates of akhourik  <dig> formed dihydroxyacetone and reduced nitrate to nitrite.

the isolates  hydrolysed starch and gelatine, the isolate tatev  <dig> utilized citrate as a carbon source. a list of phenotypic characteristics of the isolates is displayed in the table  <dig> morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics of isolates were showed their similarity to the bacillus and related genera. further molecular identification of bacterial isolates using 16s rdna sequencing method was carried out in order to recover the phylogenetic relationship between the isolates.

phylogenetic analysis of the isolates
for further identification of the strains, genomic dna was purified and 16s rdna was amplified using 16sf and 16sr primers. the near full-length 16s rdna nucleotide sequences were aligned against the 16s rrna sequences in genbank by using the ncbi blastn program. blast results for the isolates based on 16s rdna sequences for identification of the closest relatives in the genbank database are reported in table  <dig> table  <dig> closest phylogenetic affiliation of strains’ 16s rdna based on blast comparison to the genbank database

the phylogenetic tree confirms that isolate tatev  <dig> constitute a part of the cluster within one of the thermophilic groups of bacilli . another thermophilic bacilli cluster contains isolate karvachar qb <dig> with an affiliation of specie from genus anoxybacillus. a separate cluster contains isolate akhourik  <dig>  which was affiliated with genera bacillus .

the phylogenetic tree illustrates facts that were not visible on the closest affiliation analysis  results. even though the blast has shown the qb <dig> to be 99% similar to anoxybacillus flavithermus strain ak <dig>  the neighbour-joining method used has demonstrated that the qb <dig> is relatively further located on the tree in the closer with anoxybacillus flavithermus strain ak <dig>  in the case of tatev  <dig> strain the blast has shown their similarity with geobacillus sp., but in the phylogenetic tree it closely located with g. galactosicus in the same cluster.

discussion
the geology of the region where armenia and nagorno-karabakh are situated is complex, owing to accretion of terrains through plate-tectonic processes, and to ongoing tectonic activity and volcanism. a belt of quaternary volcanism led formation of the numerous low-temperature and medium hot springs in the territories of armenia. the studies of the geothermal springs in the territory of armenia indicated that compared with the upland some springs have much higher temperatures at deeper levels, where water temperature can reach up to 99 °c  <cit> . the diversity of microbes including endospore-forming bacteria have been studied in the armenian geothermal springs . however, the diversity of lipase producers thriving in armenian geothermal springs is little known.

in order to fill in the gap of knowledge about the lipase producing bacilli found in the geotherms on the territory of armenia and nagorno karabakh,  <dig> chemoorganotrophic bacilli strains were isolated from sediment samples of akhurik, tatev and karvachar geothermal springs on the enrichment media containing tween  <dig> or olive oil as a substrate. three isolates were selected as potential lipase producers and were characterized. it is particularly interesting that the isolates from tatev and akhurik geothermal springs are optimally growing at temperature of  <dig> and 55 °c, correspondingly , even though the native geothermal springs temperature in the outlet is around 28–30 °c. geological studies of the region have shown that the wells are characterized by relatively low temperatures , but have high artesian flow rates . the hotter wells  range from 700 m to 1150 m in depth  <cit> . the comparison of the optimum growth temperature of the isolates to the water temperature of geothermal spring in the deep suggests that most of the detected microorganisms are likely able to grow at reservoir temperatures and, therefore, should not be regarded as contaminants.

the properties of the isolates to utilize several mono- and disaccharides as carbon sources , digestion of gelatine, starch and casein showed some differences compared with reference strains . the isolate akhurik  <dig> is not able to utilize citrate, but can grow anaerobically and form dihydroxyacetone which is not described for b. subtilis atcc <dig> strain. the isolate tatev  <dig> compared with g. toebii sk- <dig> strain is not able to utilize glucose as carbon source, although can metabolize citrate . the phenotype of the isolate karvachar qb <dig> differed from the phenotype of the a. flavithermus dsm  <dig> type strain showing high hydrolase activities, while not being able to utilise the studied sugars as carbon sources .

the blast analysis of 16s rdna sequences revealed the close relationship of akhourik  <dig> to b. licheniformis   and the position of the isolate akhurik  <dig> in the phylogenetic tree next to b. licheniformis |km226946| strain  clearly indicate that the studied isolate is one of the b. licheniformis species. the blast analysis of 16s rdna sequences of tatev  <dig> and karvachar qb <dig> have shown the similarities with the geobacillus sp. c <dig>  and a. flavithermus ak <dig> . the phylogenetic analysis has shown the close relationship between the isolate tatev  <dig> and g. galactosidasius |am408559|. more detailed studies are necessary to confirm taxonomic affiliation of the isolates.

number of thermophilic bacilli species belonging to the genera bacillus, geobacillus and anoxybacillus have been isolated from different geothermal springs and reported as thermostable lipase producers . previous studies report that b. thermoamylovorans ch6b lipolytic enzyme-producing thermophilic microorganism have been isolated from a hot spring in galicia   <cit> . olusesan a. t. et al.  <cit>  isolated a. kamchatkensis starin kw  <dig> from malaysian hot spring and characterized as lipase producers. it seems that the bacilli genera mentioned are the dominating lipase-producing bacterial groups found in different hot springs. therefore, the potential of bacillus, geobacillus, anoxybacillus and brevibacillus species, as candidates for commercial production of thermostable lipases should be considered.

in the presented work, the lipase gene specific primer sets were constructed to determine the lipase genes in the genome of the newly isolated lipase active bacilli of anoxybacillus, bacillus and geobacillus genera. based on the gene sequences, the lipase amino acid sequences were constructed and analysed. the putative lipases of a. flavithermus karvachar qb <dig>  b.licheniformis akhurik  <dig> and geobacillus sp. tatev  <dig> consist of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues correspondingly. the deduced amino acid sequences of lipa, lipb and lipg proteins showed the highest similarity with lipases from anoxybacillus sp. ku2– <dig> , esterase from bacillus sp. , and lipase from geobacillus sp. ghh <dig>  respectively . the high sequence similarity has shown the close relationship between the proteins and made it easy to consider the association of the proteins to the same subfamilies  <cit> .

the most similar sequences with identity scores between 99% and 96% were used for the multiple alignment analysis. figure.  <dig> shows the lipa, lipb and lipg protein sequences alignments with related carboxylases. multiple alignments generated for lipa and close related lipase protein sequences displayed conserved motifs containing the active site serine residue . the revealed conserved sequence block is typical for gdsl esterase family  , which is reportedly characterized to be highly thermostable and active within 6– <dig> ph range  <cit> .

various bacillus lipases are known to have the first gliycine residue replaced with alanine in the conserved pentapeptide: ala-x-ser-x-gly as a common feature . however, the lipase form b. licheniformise akhurik  <dig> does not exhibit the typical pentapeptide and rather display a gly-asp-ser motif, characterising the enzymes grouped in family ii.

even though lipa and lipb are close to the esterases in the phylogenetic tree, these proteins are located in separate clusters in fig.  <dig>  which indicates the purposed structural/functional differences between two lipolytic enzymes.

the multiple alignments of lipg protein and closely related lipases contain blocks of conserved sequences intrinsic for true lipases from family i . lipg protein is characterised with the presence of aspartic residues involved in ca2+- binding site .

the result of phylogenetic analysis of the lipase proteins derived from the isolated bacillus, anoxybacillus and geobacillus strains and the most similar sequences with identity scores between 96% and 99% in blast analysis showed that lipa is situated in the same cluster with the lipase  <dig>  lipase  <dig> is a lipase obtained from a. flavithermus wk <dig> strain, which has been isolated from the waste water drain it the wairakei geothermal power station, new zealand  <cit> . lipg and lipb are forming a cluster with lipase  <dig> and lipase  <dig> to  <dig>  correspondingly. lipase  <dig> is a thermostable lipase protein synthesised by geobacillus sp. strain ntu  <dig> isolated from compost of on the area of taiwan  <cit> . lipase  <dig> and  <dig> are esterases which are obtained from bacillus licheniformis . considering the obtained results, a conclusion was made that independent from the environment, whether it is a geothermal spring in armenia, in new zealand or compost in taiwan, the evolution of the thermostability of the lipases has a very similar pattern.

the studied lipolytic proteins differ with their structure and therefore by functions and should be further analysed as prospects for different biotechnological applications.

CONCLUSIONS
the results widely extended the previously acquired information regarding the thermophilic lipase producing bacilli diversity of geothermal springs in armenia and nagorno karabakh while showing the importance of further investigation of the microbial community structure in armenian geothermal springs to discover and isolate new thermophilic lipase producing species. the novel thermophilic bacilli isolates serve as potential source for thermostable lipases and have promising application in biotechnology and industry. obviously, the geothermal springs contain a strong potential for further exploration of new thermozymes producing bacteria.
