BACKGROUND
common bean  is a member of the legume family  and is one out of the five cultivated species from the phaseolus genus that was domesticated by native american populations  <cit> . in the case of common bean, domestication occurred in two different regions, namely mesoamerica and the andes of south america which resulted in the andean and mesoamerican gene pools  <cit> . broad adaptation, consumer-acceptability and genetic diversity has made common bean the most widely grown legume for direct human consumption, with a worldwide distribution and presence in tropical, subtropical and temperate countries and many different environments. furthermore, common bean is the third most commonly-grown grain legume behind only the protein and oil crops soybean  and peanut . common bean is highly nutritious with almost twice the protein levels of cereals, lower fats than soybean or peanut and higher amounts of lysine, phosphorus, iron, zinc, magnesium, copper and calcium than cereals  <cit> . in many developing countries, especially those of latin america and eastern and southern africa, common bean is a principal staple to the diets of the rural and urban poor  <cit> .

microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats  are tandem repeats made up of motifs of up to six bp and are favored for the development of pcr based molecular markers due to their high rate of polymorphism  <cit> . microsatellite loci can be classified according to their motif or to the number of repeats they contain: ssrs can be perfect having only one repeat type, or imperfect characterized by having repetitions interrupted by one or more nucleotides differing from the ones of the repetition. other ssrs are compound with different combinations of perfect and imperfect repeats  <cit>  or simple, when they are not compound. when considering the number of repeats, ssrs can also be classified into two types: class i with more than  <dig> repeats and class ii with fewer than  <dig> repeats  <cit> . in common bean, microsatellites have been used for molecular characterization of cultivated and wild accessions as well as for genetic diversity analysis and anchoring of genetic maps .

genetic maps based on molecular markers have been a standard of molecular biology studies in plants since the late 1980s and primarily since the start of the millennium these have been complemented by physical maps based on assembly of large-insert libraries. physical maps were first constructed with yeast artificial chromosome clones but due to ease of dna cloning and manipulation, bacterial artificial chromosome  clones are now preferred  <cit> . a physical map is a linear arrangement of dna fragments that can be constructed using various methodologies. the most common are based on bac fingerprinting and consist of complete digestion of the clones with one or more restriction enzyme, separation on agarose or polyacrylamide and bioinformatic assembly of overlapping clones through software programs such as fpc  <cit> . shotgun clones are also used for physical map construction but are less robust than bac-by-bac characterization. physical and genetic maps are not directly comparable because each uses a different distance measure. in the case of a physical map, distance is given in kilobases  or megabases  while for the genetic map it is given in cm and is related to genetic recombination rates in a reference mapping population. furthermore, the kb/cm ratio is not constant and varies between species' genomes  <cit>  and each plant chromosome  <cit> . a physical map was constructed for common bean with a 12× coverage bac library from ciat, automated fingerprinting and fpc assembly at agi/purdue  <cit> .

different methods have been used to integrate the physical and genetic maps and can be grouped into the following: 1) in silico comparison of marker sequences to a whole genome sequence, as done for rice  <cit> ; 2) bac pooling and pcr screening as done for sorghum   <cit>  and soybean   <cit> ; 3) hybridization using overgo probes as done for various crops  <cit>  and 4) mapping of molecular markers from bac-end sequences as performed in soybean  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and grape  <cit> . in this last method, the most common and useful molecular markers have been microsatellites, which can be found in bac-end sequences  and used for genetic mapping to link bacs from a physical map. the objectives in this study were 1) to develop bes-ssr markers from the bac-end sequences for the g <dig> bac library, 2) to use these as microsatellite markers or sequence tagged connectors  on the genetic map of the recombinant inbred line population dor <dig> × g <dig> where one parent matched the library source, and 3) to produce an integrated genetic/physical map for the species.

RESULTS
identification of ssr motifs in the bac-ends
a total of  <dig> microsatellites were identified in the  <dig>  bac-end sequences from the physical mapping project presented in schlueter et al.  <cit> . these microsatellites were named using a combination of the series name bmb with a sequential number, and organized according to the contig or singletons they were derived from, their repetition type and the motif they contained . among the microsatellites identified in the bes evaluation,  <dig> were associated with bac contigs and were considered further while  <dig> were from singletons and were not used. all the microsatellites were perfect, meaning they had just one motif.

in the  <dig> contigged ssrs identified, di-nucleotide  and tri-nucleotide  motifs were more common than tetra-nucleotide  and penta-nucleotide  motifs. the most common di-nucleotide motif was at/ta , followed by ag/tc  while ac/tg microsatellites were uncommon. among the tri-nucleotides, the most frequent motifs were a/t rich, especially ata/tat  and aga/tct . in contrast, the act/tga, agc/tcg and cgc/gcg motifs were much less frequent and all together accounted for only 6% of the ssrs found. among all the motif types, most of the ssrs  belonged to class ii  with the remainder of ssrs were from class i, these being mainly of the motifs at/ta , ag/tc  and ata/tat .

bes-ssr polymorphism screening
prior to the screening of the parental genotypes dor <dig> and g <dig>  a group of  <dig> microsatellites were selected from the bac-end ssrs identified above so as to focus on the ssr motifs that were most likely to show polymorphism and to be useful in linking the greatest number of bac clones to the genetic map. selection was based on repeat type with priority given to di-nucleotides and tri-nucleotides that were a/t rich and had five or more repetitions; and on the ssrs being located in bac contigs rather than in singletons. in addition, an effort was made to select only one ssr locus per contig from the physical map. as a result, the subgroup of  <dig> selected ssrs covered an equal number of contigs with 75% of the bes-ssrs selected corresponding to at/ta and ata/tat motifs, 19% to ag/tc or aga/tct motifs and the rest having the motifs ac/tg, tca/agt, ggt/cca and agc/tcg. in terms of microsatellite class,  <dig> bes-ssrs belonged to class i and  <dig> to class ii.

in the molecular characterization of the new ssrs in the parental survey, all the ssrs were single copy and the amplified products had the expected size, the amplification success rate was  <dig> %  and the calculated polymorphism rate was 65% . the  <dig> ssr primer pairs that presented amplification problems such as lack of amplification, multiple banding, stuttering or unexpected size amplification products were not used for further analysis. no relation was found between these amplification difficulties and the repeat motifs. furthermore the  <dig> successful primer pairs represented all the ssr motifs described above. when microsatellites of different motif sizes were compared for their polymorphism rate , the di-nucleotide based loci were somewhat more polymorphic at 70% than tri-nucleotides based loci at 47%. similarly, class i microsatellites were more polymorphic on average  with  <dig> out of  <dig> ssrs showing allelic difference compared to class ii microsatellites  with only  <dig> out of  <dig> with allele differences. in terms of the individual motifs, at/ta motif microsatellites were highly polymorphic .

genetic mapping of bes-ssrs
the  <dig> polymorphic bmb markers identified in the parental screening were scored in the recombinant inbred line mapping population based on the cross dor <dig> × g <dig>  and integrated into the genetic map for this population from blair et al.  <cit> . integration was successful with a total of  <dig> new bmb markers mapped into the genetic map with a high lod score. molecular markers mapping with a lod below  <dig>  or unassigned to established linkage group were excluded from the map. for example, the ssr markers bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig> and bmb <dig> could not be mapped since they were assigned to more than one linkage group with equivalent lod scores. the markers bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig> were assigned to only one linkage group but their lod scores were lower than  <dig> . finally another set of markers  presented distances from neighboring markers longer than  <dig> cm and therefore were not included given the high saturation of the map.

the new genetic map which included  <dig> previously mapped ssr loci from blair et al.  <cit>  was found to cover  <dig>  cm and had a total of  <dig> ssrs all together with an average distance between neighboring loci of  <dig>  cm . linkage group lengths ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  and a greater number of bmb loci were placed on b08f , and b02d  and a lower number on b06g  compared to other linkage groups. despite this, the distribution of the bmb loci was found to be random across all linkage groups according to a chi-square test . while most linkage groups had close to the average of  <dig> bmb loci per linkage group, bmb loci were predominant on linkage groups b01h, b08f and b10j compared to previous ssr loci. finally, segregation distortion was observed for  <dig> out of the  <dig> newly-mapped loci, this means that the expected ratio of 1: <dig> was not observed in the progeny for these markers with chi-square tests at p =  <dig> . most of these loci with segregation distortion were mapped on linkage groups b08f, b03c or b02d. segregation distortion was towards the parental genotype g <dig> on linkage group b01h, b02d, b06g and b08f, while in b03c, b07a and b09k segregation distortion was towards dor <dig> 

integrated genetic/physical map for common bean
the information from genetic mapping of the bes-ssrs was then used to create an integrated genetic and physical map for the common bean genome. this integrated map is presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> with various components shown diagrammatically: for example to the far left of the figure is the genetic map shown as a continuous line with genetic distances in cm. the physical map is shown as a series of smaller lines adjacent to the genetic map, representing anchored bac clones and their corresponding contigs. anchoring points between both maps are depicted as grey squares representing mapped ssr loci on the genetic map and bac-ends. integration points are numbered sequentially from the top to the bottom of the linkage group and orientation of the linkage groups follows blair et al.  <cit> . the bac clones and corresponding contigs associated with each anchoring microsatellite marker are given for the  <dig> linkage points throughout the genome .

to facilitate interpretation of the physical linkages with the genetic map, we represented each bac clone as a line that is proportional to its length and showed whether the bes-ssr was anchored to the forward/5' or reverse/3' bac-end by orientation of the grey box at the top or bottom of the line, respectively. finally, for consistency between new bmb markers and the bm, bmc and bmd markers mapped by blair et al.  <cit> , the ata rich markers from blair et al.  <cit>  are re-named as bma markers with the same numerical identity as in that previous study. additionally, some of these bma markers were remapped to their ideal locations based on the higher saturation of this genetic map. in terms of the physical coverage of the integrated genetic map, a total of  <dig>  individual bac clones were represented by the  <dig> contigs linked to the genetic map. the average number of contigged bacs per bes-ssr anchor point was  <dig> 

discussion
ssr motif prevalence and repeat length in common bean
a large number of ssrs were identified in the bac-end sequences in this study with the most common microsatellites having di-nucleotide repeats rather than tri-, tetra- or penta-nucleotide repeats. the most common motifs were those rich on adenine and thymine especially at/ta and ata/tat. the prevalence of di-nucleotide over tri-nucleotide or other ssrs was observed previously in the common bean genome by various authors  <cit>  and also may be characteristic of cowpea   <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and chickpea   <cit> . similarly, the high frequency of a/t rich motifs among ssrs in common bean agrees with results of métais et al.  <cit>  and blair et al.  <cit>  and appears to be characteristic of legumes. in other plants, the microsatellites n, n, n and n are prevalent  <cit> .

in terms of the predominant microsatellite class, most di-nucleotides were class i  as seen in other legumes species such as medicago, lotus and soybean  <cit>  but most tri-nucleotide based loci were class ii. repeat length may be constrained by evolutionary forces as has been seen in the human genome where deleterious mutations can occur as a consequence of the expansion or contraction of very long ssr repeats  <cit> . the maximum repeat length for the bes-ssrs in this study even among class i at/ta di-nucleotide loci was  <dig> bp suggesting that ultra-long ssrs are uncommon in bac-end sequences from p. vulgaris. this is in agreement with previously results for genomic microsatellites obtained by hanai et al.  <cit>  and blair et al.  <cit>  with at rich microsatellites with the exception of bma <dig> which was longer than  <dig> nt. the rate of mutation in n microsatellites was found to be higher than for n microsatellites in drosophila melanogaster due to a bias in the mismatch repair mechanism against at motifs which led to more variable and longer ssrs for this motif  <cit> . a similar situation could take place in plants, although more specific studies are necessary.

ssr polymorphism was related to motif type rather than to motif length
overall polymorphism rate in this study was related in the first place to ssr motif and secondly to ssr length. higher polymorphism was seen in di-nucleotides in comparison with tri-nucleotides, while there was some tendency for long class i ssrs to be more polymorphic although this was not as pronounced as expected. this suggests that longer microsatellite are not necessarily preferential targets for replication slippage, unequal crossing-over or higher mutation rates compared to shorter microsatellites as has been suggested by previous studies  <cit> . it is also possible that tri-nucleotide or shorter motifs were preferentially found in gene-coding regions that would be more conserved but this was not analyzed for the bes since these are generally non-coding according to schlueter et al.  <cit> .

in an attempt to select highly polymorphic markers, we concentrated on a/t rich motif loci based on our success with this type of microsatellite in previous genetic mapping  <cit> . in general, at/ta and ata/tat microsatellites were highly prevalent and highly polymorphic in the inter-genepool population, however, some amplification problems of these microsatellites may have been attributable to their palindromic sequences, low alignment temperature or high probability of self complementarity. further studies could use ag/tc or ac/ga based microsatellites, but these have lower polymorphism rates in common bean than the at rich microsatellites  <cit> .

uniform distribution of bes-ssr loci across the common bean genome
in the genetic mapping phase of this project, we found the bes-ssr loci to be distributed across all linkage groups with no significant bias towards any specific chromosome although a slightly larger number of bes-ssr loci were found on linkage groups b02d and b08f. the good coverage of the bmb markers is in contrast to other ssr mapping studies in common beans especially for the n-based bm markers, the gene-based bmd markers  <cit>  the at-rich bma markers  <cit>  and to some extent other pv markers  <cit> , all of which have tended to be more clustered. one of the goals of including new microsatellites in a previously constructed genetic map was to fill in map coverage especially in gaps from this previous mapping  <cit> . as a result, we wanted molecular markers that did not map together but rather mapped uniformly across the genome. the complementarities of the bes-ssr markers with previous mapping allowed us to supplement coverage on nearly all the linkage groups, but especially on b01h, b03c, b05e, b06g, b08f and b10j. as a result, the average number of microsatellites per linkage group in the dor <dig> × g <dig> map stands at  <dig>  with all linkage groups having more than  <dig> ssr loci except for b06g. for some unknown reason linkage group b02d was heavily populated by microsatellites in this study as well as previously  <cit> .

the uniformity of the bes-ssr loci across the genome may be related to the fact that the bac-ends were a representative sample of the entire genome and to the similar and uniform physical size of common bean chromosomes, based on cytogenetic study by pedrosa-harand  <cit> . in that study, the authors assigned linkage groups to common bean chromosomes based on previously mapped single copy rflp sequences used as fish probes. the authors determined chromosome size based on fish signal strength assuming a genome size of  <dig> mb, and found that b01h, b03c, b07a and b08f all had similar sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> mb, while b06g  had a smaller size and the rest were intermediate with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> mb. tight correlation was not found between the physical length for each chromosome and the number of bes-ssr markers mapped for each linkage group in our study or the genetic length of the linkage group, meaning that the largest chromosomes did not have more ssrs or longer length as a genetic map. however, we have observed in the past that microsatellites from enriched libraries that target only a few motifs such as long ga/ct, ca/gt or ata/tat repeats  <cit>  were biased towards certain chromosomes such as b02d and b04b  <cit>  and towards specific chromosomal regions  <cit> .

the uniform distribution of the bes-ssr markers would be the result of different factors. for example, the fact that we targeted various ssr motifs may have helped increase the chances of having randomly distributed markers  <cit> . in addition, the restriction enzyme used to generate the bac library in the physical mapping project may have helped ensure an even genomic distribution. in our case, the bac clones and resulting bes were from a hindiii derived bac library for the andean genotype g <dig>  <cit> . notably, hindiii is a type ii site-specific enzyme with a fairly common restriction site therefore it is likely that distribution of the enzyme digestion sites may have contributed to eliminating biases in the bac contigs generated. likewise, the bes we sampled were from the entire library and therefore the eventual map location of bes-ssrs was random. these results also suggest, as previously postulated by pedrosa-harand et al.  <cit> , that repeats can be interspersed with single copy sequences in regions different from pericentromeric heterochromatin.

despite the random distribution, segregation distortion toward a specific genotype and assignment of distorted markers in a few clusters was observed. segregation distortion is quite often observed in common bean as described by blair et al.  <cit> , checa and blair  <cit>  and frei et al.  <cit>  and suggests the existence of incompatibility genes, or genes for sporophytic selection and gamete elimination in the species. in this study segregation distortion was observed for the linkage groups b02d, b03c and b08f, principally. for linkage group b02d the distorted loci were in the middle of the linkage group, while for b03c and b08f they were located distally.

integration of the genetic and physical maps
in the integration phase of this study, we used a method based on the use of bes-ssr anchoring points which was expected to be highly precise and accurate if the contig assembly had been performed well  <cit> . the bes-ssr markers used as anchor points allowed us to integrate  <dig>  bac clones through  <dig> contigs which together had a physical length of  <dig>  mb based on the fpc assembly, thus corresponding to  <dig> % of the bean genome based on a genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> .

the genome coverage of the integrated map of common bean could be increased by using a larger number of contig-based bes-ssr markers as was done for the integrated map of medicago truncatula  <cit> . for example, if the  <dig> bes-ssr microsatellite loci had been screened, they potentially would have linked  <dig>  bac clones, almost half the library, while the  <dig> selected bes-ssrs represented contigs with  <dig>  bac clones from the fingerprinting described in schlueter et al.  <cit> . the integrated common bean genetic/physical map is saturated enough to map qtl or genes to physical regions of the genome.

the integrated map, apart from being a resource for genetic mapping or positional cloning, could be used to find new linkages between contigs. in this case, only two bmb markers  were close enough  to postulate the possible overlap or close proximity of their constituent bac clones. for the other bes-ssr markers, clear genetic separation showed that none of the assembled contigs overlapped with each other. despite this, these results do not preclude the possibility of merging contigs through further genetic mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
apart from our objective of saturating the dor <dig> × g <dig> genetic map with bes-ssr markers, our other main goal was the integration of the physical map of common bean with this genetic map. the importance of an integrated physical and genetic map is in its ability to physically locate loci that are known to be polymorphic between mapping parents with a high degree of precision and accuracy to a set of contigged large-insert clones or sequences.

in silico method used for ssr identification in bac-end sequences was a good option for obtaining widespread and evenly distributed markers of adequate polymorphism. the genetic map was saturated in ssrs and was easily linked to the physical map. it is pertinent to take into account the robustness of the integrated map obtained because the same genotype used for the physical map construction was one of the parents of the mapping populations used to place bes-ssr markers.
