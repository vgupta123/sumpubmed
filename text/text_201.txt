BACKGROUND
technological developments in chromosome engineering are essential for the manipulation and functional analysis of genomic dna fragments. artificial chromosomes, such as bacterial artificial chromosomes   <cit>  and yeast artificial chromosomes   <cit> , have been used for these purposes in combination with transgenesis. bac and yac transgenesis techniques have contributed greatly to genome research. however, there are several technological limitations in their cloning size, genetic modification and insert stability. bac clones are easy to manipulate and retrieve due to their plasmid form and the stability of the cloned dna. the methods for modifying bac inserts require additional recombination components, e.g., reca or phage-derived recombination proteins  <cit> . the bac system can generally accommodate up to 300 kb genomic inserts. in contrast to the bac system, genomic dna inserts of up to 2 mb can be used with the yac system. although the inserts can be easily modified by homologous recombination, yacs often suffer from insert chimerism and unwanted rearrangements due to potent and constitutive yeast recombination activity  <cit> . generally, the isolation of intact yacs is difficult because of their linear form and contamination with endogenous yeast chromosomes. thus, these two systems have complementary advantages over each other in terms of cloning capacity and insert stability.

the bacillus subtilis genome  vector system has been developed as a novel cloning system using a unique concept in which the entire  <dig>  mb genome of b. subtilis functions as a vector  <cit> . the cloning strategy for this vector system is based on unique b. subtilis features  <cit> . b. subtilis expresses competence-related genes at the late stage of cell growth, and their products, transformation machinery molecules, are assembled in the cell membrane. the transformation machinery non-specifically binds and imports extracellular dna fragments into the cytoplasm in single-stranded form. the recombinogenic dna is incorporated into the b. subtilis genome by homologous recombination. therefore, if the b. subtilis genome is engineered to have homologous cloning site sequences, a target dna fragment flanked by homologous sequences is easily cloned into the bgm. special handling of the bgm vector system is not required  <cit> . b. subtilis can be cultivated under the same conditions as escherichia coli in lb broth at 37°c. the competency of b. subtilis enables easy transformation procedures and efficient recombination reactions. for instance, competent b. subtilis cells can be prepared by merely cultivating the cells in a special medium for several hours, and these cells are transformed by simply mixing in dna fragments without additional heat-shock or electroporation  <cit> .

the specific features of the bgm vector system include a cloning capacity over 3 mb  <cit> , the stable propagation of cloned dna fragments in a single copy per cell and the amenability of various modification strategies based on reca-mediated homologous recombination  <cit> . these advantages make the bgm vector system an attractive alternative for the manipulation of large dna. it has been used to clone genomic dna from several species, including cyanobacteria  <cit> , arabidopsis <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . modifications consisting of deleting and fusing cloned inserts have also been achieved  <cit> . however, genetic modification methods have not been fully established in the bgm vector system; targeted insertion and inversion modifications remain to be demonstrated, and the fusion of two contiguous dna fragments is limited to clones that are orientated in the same direction. in addition, the bgm system has not been applied to transgenesis. thus, the bgm vector system is a developing technology with attractive potential, which includes its megabase-cloning capacity and homologous recombination-based genetic modification.

in this study, we have added two new genetic modifications to the bgm system tool kit. one is targeted insertion of a reporter gene without introducing an unwanted selectable marker at the target site when constructing the transgene. another is inversion of the cloned insert to align its orientation so that two contiguous bac clones in opposite directions can be used to reconstruct the genomic structure. in fact, inversion of a cloned insert has not been reported in any other system. to explore the potential utility of the bgm vector in mouse transgenesis, we focused on the fish-like odorant receptor  gene family. this or family is a phylogenetically ancient mammalian or family  <cit> . the mouse class i or gene family consists of  <dig> genes, forming an approximately 3 mb gene cluster  <cit> . although a cis-acting locus control region is expected to regulate transcription, such a region has not been found. in this study, we not only demonstrated the ability to use the bgm vector system to manipulate and reconstruct mouse genomic dna fragments and perform mouse transgenesis , but we also found evidence of a cis-acting regulatory element for class i or gene expression.

RESULTS
cloning of genomic dna fragments into the bgm vector
mouse genomic bac libraries have been constructed that cover nearly the entire mouse genome, and each clone contains a genomic dna fragment with an average size of approximately 150 kb  <cit> . the bgm vector system can utilize these valuable dna resources in a one-step transfer  <cit> . we prepared two bac clones, designated bac <dig> and bac <dig>  which overlapped each other via 82 kb region and carried 114 kb and 220 kb mouse genomic dna fragments containing two and ten class i or genes, respectively . we transferred these bac inserts into bgm vectors, which harbor bac vector sequences, to clone the bac inserts by homologous recombination   <cit> . briefly, the original bgm vector is resistant to spectinomycin  and sensitive to neomycin  due to repression of the pr-neo cassette by the ci repressor. the bac inserts taken up by the b. subtilis are integrated directly into the genome  via double crossings-over recombination with the bac vector sequences of the bgm vector. once a bac insert is cloned into the bgm vector, the recombinants become resistant to nm and sensitive to spc, because the bac insert replaces the ci-spc cassette. this selection mechanism can be used in ci cassette-mediating modifications, such as the targeted insertion technique. because two 23-bp sequences “atgactctcttaa/ggtagccaaa” recognized by the rare-cutting endonuclease, i-ppoi are introduced at the both sides of the bac cloning site, i-ppoi digestion enables to excise out the cloned insert from the bgm vector. the inserts were evaluated by digesting the genomic dna of the recombinant vectors with i-ppoi followed by contour-clamped homologous electric field  gel electrophoresis . three of seven candidate clones  in bac <dig> and one of  <dig> candidate clones in bac <dig> contained bac inserts. the efficiency of cloning the bac insert into the bgm vector differs between bac clones used . we cloned  <dig> different bac clones with  <dig> to 100% efficiency . the cloned inserts were further confirmed by southern blot analyses using the original bac clones as probes; the results indicated that the digest patterns of the bgm recombinants were identical to those of the original bac clones, except for the fragments derived from the ends of the insert . thus, the bgm vector system imported the bac insert by simple transformation, which enabled the use of already established valuable bac resources.

targeted insertion of a reporter gene
to construct transgenes for the analysis of cis-acting elements of class i or genes, we inserted an ires-tauegfp reporter gene cassette  <cit> , which consisted of an internal ribosome entry site and the tauegfp fusion protein coding sequence, into the class i or gene mor42- <dig> locus by two-step recombination using the ci-spc cassette . in the first step, the bgm clones containing the bac inserts were transformed with a reporter cassette with the selection marker ci-spc flanked by  <dig>  kb homology regions to the target or locus  to generate tg-110cisp and tg-220cisp. four of  <dig> spc-resistant tg-110cisp clones and six of  <dig> spc-resistant tg-220cisp clones were sensitive to nm. in the second step, the counterselection was performed to remove selection marker using a reporter gene cassette without a ci-spc cassette to generate two transgenes, tg- <dig> and tg- <dig>  nm-resistant and spc-sensitive clones were screened by pcr to amplify the region between egfp and r arm. the ci-spc cassettes were correctly removed in four of  <dig> tested clones for tg- <dig> and two of  <dig> clones for tg- <dig>  negative clones were no pcr product, suggesting that insert dna sequences had been also deleted along with the ci-spc cassettes. relatively low success of the recombination events in the counterselection was previously reported in the bgm system  <cit>  as well as the bac system  <cit> . accordingly, two transgenes, tg- <dig> and tg- <dig>  which were derived from bac <dig> and bac <dig>  respectively, were constructed by inserting ires-tauegfp 3 bp downstream of the mor42- <dig> stop codon. southern blot analysis of representative clones with the r arm probe indicated the correct insertion of the reporter cassette . thus, we established a targeted insertion method using the bgm vector system with homologous recombination using several antibiotic resistance genes and the ci gene without leaving any trace of selection markers or site-specific recombination sites, such as loxp and frt, in the target sequence   <cit> .

inversion of the insert in the bgm vector
tg- <dig> and tg- <dig> shared approximately 82 kb of overlapping sequence , which would enable the fusion of these two fragments to create a longer transgenic construct in the bgm vector system if the two clones were cloned in the same direction. this technique extends one insert by homologous recombination between the overlapping region of another insert and the common vector region  <cit> . however, the tg- <dig> and tg- <dig> inserts were cloned in opposite directions in the bgm vector. in this case, the two clones could not be used to extend the insert by the double crossing-over recombination. insert inversion techniques have not been reported in the bgm or other conventional systems. to fuse these two fragments, we first inverted the tg- <dig> insert to orient it in the same direction as tg- <dig> using two incomplete fragments of the tetracycline resistance gene , te  and et , which shared an approximately  <dig>  kb overlap region designated e <cit> . the erythromycin resistance  and phleomycin resistance  genes were added as selection markers to the te and et fragments, respectively. the two inversion cassettes, te-erm and phl-et, were sequentially inserted at the ends of the tg- <dig> insert in the reverse direction . briefly, phl-et cassette was inserted to the right end of the tg- <dig> insert by transforming tg- <dig> with the linearized bac plasmid containing the phl-et cassette and a  <dig>  kb homology region. the phl-et cassette was inserted in all five phl-resistant clones assessed by pcr. subsequently, we inserted the te-erm to the left end of the insert using the linearized bac plasmid containing the te-erm cassette with a  <dig>  kb homology region, and obtained tg-110 t/p . intrachromosomal homologous recombination between te and et via the overlapping region e  resulted in an inversion of the insert and the formation of a complete tet gene, enabling the selection of the inverted clone  using tet . we obtained over  <dig> tet-resistant colonies from 20 μl of tg-110 t/p overnight culture. the formation of tet and erm-e-phl cassettes was confirmed by pcr in all four randomly picked clones from these colonies. as expected, southern blot analysis using a tet probe revealed changes in size of the tet cassette fragments, indicating the successful inversion of the tg- <dig> insert . because the direction of the inserts is not coordinated in the bac library, the inversion technique for insert fragments is essential to fuse and reconstruct genomic structures using bac clones.

fusing two inserts to reconstruct genomic structures
we then fused tg- <dig> and the inverted tg- <dig> to enlarge the mouse genomic dna fragment . the ci-spc and ci-bsr marker gene cassettes were inserted into the left end of the tg- <dig> insert and the right end of the inverted tg- <dig> insert, respectively. we transformed tg- <dig> with the linearized bac plasmid containing the ci-spc and a  <dig>  kb homology region, and obtained tg-220cisp clones . tg-110-inverted was similarly transformed with the ci-bsr cassette fragment containing a  <dig>  kb homology region, and obtained tg-110cibs clones . the two transgenes were fused by genetic transformation of tg-220cisp with the purified genomic dna of tg-110cibs. homologous recombination of the 82 kb overlapping region and the common sequence of the bgm vectors resulted in the extension of the insert to generate tg-250sb. twenty-six of  <dig> spc- and bs-resistant colony recombinants were sensitive to nm. we selected two representative clones for further examinations. the two tg-250sb clones turned to be sensitive to tet, whose resistance gene exists in the left end of the tg-110-inverted insert and was removed by the fusion, suggesting correct recombination occurs to extend the insert. i-ppoi/chef analyses of the tg-250sb genomic dna demonstrated a larger band corresponding to the 252 kb fused insert fragment . southern blot analysis showed that tg-250sb was composed of two transgenes, tg- <dig> and tg- <dig> , indicating that the two inserts were successfully fused to extend the insert size.

dna sequencing of modified and reconstructed bgm clones
to verify the reliability of the bgm vector system in manipulating genomic dna fragments and its accuracy in genetic engineering, we performed dna sequencing of the original bac clones , the modified bgm clones  and the fused bgm clone . the read mapping results are summarized in table  <dig>  no mutation was observed in the cloned and modified mouse genomic inserts during manipulations of the bgm vector, and all targeted modifications were accurately introduced. a few nucleotides differed from the reference sequence data in both bac <dig> and bac <dig>  two single-nucleotide differences were found between bac <dig> and the reference sequence : the replacement of g at positions  <dig> and  <dig> by a and t, respectively. four differences were found between bac <dig> and the reference data : g at  <dig>  g at  <dig>  a at  <dig> and g at  <dig> were replaced by a, a, g and a, respectively. therefore, starting from targeted insertion, all possible genetic modifications, i.e., insertion, deletion, inversion and fusion to the targeted site, could now be introduced using the bgm system without leaving unnecessary sequences in the insert dna.

reads obtained from the illumina genome analyzer iix were analyzed and mapped to each reference sequence using clc genomics workbench  <dig>  . the number of mapped reads in each sample was enough to evaluate mutations. analyzed dna samples are follows: original bac clones of bac <dig> and bac <dig> and bgm clones of tg110cibs, tg220cisp and tg250sb.

generation of bgm transgenic mice
other cloning tools for large dna fragments, such as bacs and yacs, in combination with transgenesis, have greatly contributed to life science research, including functional analyses of genomic dna, the study of gene regulation mechanisms and disease research  <cit> . however, the bgm vector system has not yet been applied to transgenesis. thus, we attempted to generate transgenic mice carrying the modified and reconstructed transgenes, tg- <dig> and tg-250sb, to demonstrate the potency of the bgm vector system in transgenesis . in contrast to other systems, the bgm vector system utilizes the entire endogenous genome as a vector. therefore, the transgene can be obtained by digesting the genome with i-ppoi, whose recognition sites are introduced to flank the bac vector sequence . but its concentration is expected to be low because of the single copy of the transgene per genome/cell. thus, we prepared linearized transgenes by excision from the bgm vector using i-ppoi digestion and chef and concentrated the transgenes by conventional electrophoresis followed by electroelution and dialysis with a high-salt injection buffer . using the method established in this study, linearized microinjection-grade transgenes were readily prepared from the bgm clones. the purified transgenes were microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs to obtain founder transgenic mice. new born mice were genotyped by pcr to amplify transgene-specific sequences. we designed three primer sets to amplify bac vector sequences  and egfp  to assess the integration of the transgene into chromosome. assuming that all three pcr positive mouse would carry an intact transgene, we obtained six tg- <dig> founders from  <dig> newborn mice. partial integrations of the transgene were also observed in  <dig> mice, which were pcr positive for the left end of the transgene only. for tg-250sb, four of  <dig> pups carried an intact transgene, and one lacked the left end sequence. these transgenic ratios are comparable to a conventional bac transgenesis  <cit> . germline transmission of the transgenes was obtained in  <dig> transgenic founders for tg- <dig>  and two for tg-250sb .

experimental evidence of a cis-acting element for a class i or gene
an individual olfactory sensory neuron  expresses only one or gene in a monoallelic and mutually exclusive manner  <cit> . class i ors are expressed almost exclusively by osns in the dorsal main olfactory epithelium , and these osns project their axons to a specific subset of glomeruli in the dorsal domain of the olfactory bulb   <cit> . the transgenes of the mor42- <dig> locus are designed to activate the bicistronic expression of mor42- <dig> and tauegfp, a fusion of the microtubule-associated protein tau with egfp, to visualize the mor42- <dig> transgene expression and osn axonal projections. thus, if the transgenes contain a mor42- <dig> cis-acting element, mor42- <dig> expression can be monitored by egfp fluorescence. for tg- <dig>  we analyzed  <dig> transgenic lines and  <dig> founder. none of the tg- <dig> transgenic mice displayed labeled osns. for tg-250sb, two transgenic lines established from two founders were egfp positive , indicating expression of mor42- <dig> transgene. remaining two founders were egfp negative. whole-mount images of the moe and the ob of tg-250sb showed a punctate egfp expression pattern within the dorsal region of the moe and axonal projections into the dorsomedial and dorsolateral glomerulus of each ob . to assess the copy number and integrity of the transgene, we analyzed tg-250sb by southern blot using mor42- <dig> coding region as a probe , which cross-hybridizes to highly homologous gene mor42- <dig> . southern blot analysis showed that the specific band corresponding to the transgene was observed in expected size and the bands corresponding to endogenous mor42- <dig> were the same between control and tg-250sb, indicating that the intact transgenes were integrated into chromosome, and this is not due to a gene targeting event. ratio of signal intensities  were  <dig>  for line # <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for line # <dig> , indicating the copy number of transgene of two and one for line# <dig> and line# <dig>  respectively. because the tg-250sb transgene carries mor42- <dig>  intensities of the band corresponding to mor42- <dig> increased  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold in tg-250sb line # <dig> with reference to the control, confirming one copy of the transgene was integrated.

osns expressing highly homologous ors tend to project their axons to near but distinct subsets of glomeruli in the ob  <cit> . because mor42- <dig> and mor42- <dig>  members of the mor <dig> subfamily, share 97% amino acid similarity in their coding sequences, the axonal projection site of mor42-3-expressing osns was expected to be close to that of mor42- <dig>  using axonal projection of osns expressing endogenous mor42- <dig> as control, we examined the mor42-1-itg gene-targeted mouse  <cit>  in which an ires-tauegfp reporter was inserted downstream of mor42- <dig>  the glomerular positions of transgenic-mor42- <dig>  in tg-250sb transgenic mice were similar to those of endogenous mor42- <dig> . we further analyzed the detailed structure of the tg-mor42- <dig> glomeruli. glomeruli are innervated exclusively by axons from osns expressing the same or  <cit> . we performed double-label immunohistochemistry on coronal cryosections with antibodies against olfactory marker protein  to stain all mature osn and antibodies against egfp to label mor42- <dig> transgene- or mor42- <dig> endogenous gene-expressing osns. tg-mor42- <dig> glomeruli contained a mixture of egfp-negative and egfp-positive axons, whereas mor42- <dig> glomeruli of homozygous mor42-1-itg mice were completely egfp positive , suggesting that axons of osns expressing tg-mor42- <dig> formed glomeruli together with those of osns expressing endogenous mor42- <dig> <cit> . the projection site and converged glomerular structure of osns expressing the egfp reporter suggest proper expression of the mor42- <dig> transgene. taken together, these results indicate that a cis-acting element for mor42- <dig> is present in the extended region from tg- <dig> and provide the first experimental evidence of a cis-acting element for a class i or gene.

discussion
the bgm vector system is a unique and developing technology for propagation of very large fragments of heterologous dna. in this study, we have demonstrated that the bgm vector system enables the complete genetic modification of large genomic dna fragments, including targeted insertion, deletion, inversion and fusion. in addition, we demonstrated the existence of a cis-acting element of a mouse class i or gene by combining the bgm vector system with mouse transgenesis.

the bgm vector has several specific features that create advantages over the bac and yac systems. first, the megabase-scale cloning capacity of the bgm vector is greater than that of conventional systems. the bgm vector system is capable of cloning the entire  <dig>  mb synechocystis genome  <cit> , and the upper limit of clone size has not yet been determined. second, cloned dna inserts show high structural and genetic stability  <cit>  because of their direct insertion into the single circular host genome. in fact, dna sequencing of modified and reconstructed genomic dna fragments confirmed the structural stability of inserts in the bgm vector even though genome inserts included many repetitive sequences and several similar class i or genes. however, it should be noted that, similar to the yac system, recombination is active in b. subtilis; thus, unwanted rearrangements may occur. this issue can be solved by introducing an inducible reca system into the bgm vector. third, various accurate modification approaches are available. the ci repressor cassette-mediating modification technique provides desired gene modifications without leaving any traces in the dna, enabling the repetitive modification of bgm inserts. in addition to insertion and deletion modifications, we demonstrated the elongation of inserts via the fusion of two dna fragments even though they were initially oriented in opposite directions in the bac vector, thus providing a method for the construction of giant recombinant dna fragments. considering with maximum cloning capacity of the bgm vector of  <dig> mbp  <cit> , the fusion of contiguous genomic fragments is a powerful technique for the reconstruction of gene structures surrounding intergenic regulatory elements  <cit> . in addition, our sequencing analyses confirmed that these targeted genetic modifications were accurate and reliable. fourth, bgm inserts can be simply retrieved by i-ppoi digestion because a single host cell contains a single genome composed of the recombinant insert and the  <dig>  mb bgm vector. as we demonstrated, bac clones are easily transferred, modified and reconstructed in the bgm vector. it is noteworthy that modified bgm inserts can be restored to a circular bac form  <cit> , enabling this “shuttle genetic modification” of bac clones to enhance the utility of bgm vector system.

finally, we have used mouse genomic dna to demonstrate the suitability of the bgm system for genetic manipulation and transgenesis. many bac libraries have been already established and/or are under construction for diverse species, including mammals, other vertebrates and plants  <cit> . because the bgm vector harbors bac vector sequences for cloning bac inserts, this system can be applied to other species. moreover, the bgm vector can be designed to clone other library resources by introducing cloning vector sequences from other systems, e.g., yacs and human artificial chromosomes. because the bgm vector system can provide large cloning capacity in size and various accurate gene manipulation approaches, the bgm vector system is an attractive cloning tool for the manipulation of large dna fragments, such as in the functional analysis of genomic dna and recombinant genomes in synthetic biology  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated targeted insertion and inversion methods in the bgm system to add to its repertoire of genetic modification approaches. using these techniques, a 252 kb transgene was reconstructed from two bac clones whose inserts were initially oriented in opposite direction with reference to the bac vector sequence. dna sequence analysis of modified bgm clones demonstrated the genetic stability of inserts and correct modifications. furthermore, we established and applied bgm-based mouse transgenesis. by analyzing the generated transgenic mice, a cis-acting element for a mouse class i or gene was experimentally demonstrated for the first time. the bgm vector is a new platform that provides a complete genetic modification approach for large genomic dna fragments without leaving selection markers or dispensable sequences. the bgm vector system and its application to transgenesis offer a new genetic approach for not only systems and synthetic biology but also other life science research fields.
