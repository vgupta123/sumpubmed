BACKGROUND
a wide variety of intracellular events are initiated via temporal change of ligand concentrations. one of the most important ligands in many cells is calcium . calcium interacts with and regulates the activities of a large number of calcium-binding proteins as well as numerous effectors. the number of functional calcium binding sites within these proteins can range from one or two to ten or more . the most common number of calcium binding sites is four: as observed in the most ubiquitous protein, calmodulin as well as troponin and other ef-hand containing proteins  <cit> . temporal elevation of intracellular free ca2+ is the key regulatory factor of the ca2+-dependent protein activity . the characteristics of the induced signal are not fully understood. it remains to be determined how a single ligand is able to govern numerous intracellular properties.

whilst the multisite ligand binding is not limited to ca2+ signaling, ca2+ is probably the most versatile ion, regulating the largest number of cellular events. several ca2+-binding proteins can be considered as examples of multisite ligand protein interactions. structural biology investigations of calcium binding proteins in complexes with target protein peptides have suggested that the specificity in ca2+-cam binding protein-dependent target activation arises from the diversity of interaction interfaces between the ca2+-regulated protein and its target proteins . the most ubiquitous protein, calmodulin , consists of two globular domains, each domain containing a pair of helix-loop-helix ca2+-binding motifs called ef-hands  <cit> . in earlier studies the authors demonstrated that in addition to the diversity of cam-target interfaces; the cam selectivity emerges from its target specific ca2+-affinity; the number of ca2+ ions bound and the target specific cooperativity .

another major factor that contributes to the selectivity of seemingly simultaneous regulation of several multisite ca2+ binding proteins and ca2+-mediated processes is the temporal alterations of ca2+ . the remarkable variety of ca2+ signals in cells, ranging from infrequent spikes to sustained oscillations and plateaus, requires an understanding of how fast intracellular calcium changes regulate the kinetics of multiple multisite ca2+ binding proteins. therefore mathematical modeling of ca2+ jump induced responses could prove to be invaluable in the interpretation of transient kinetic experiments.

cooperative binding is a special case of molecular interactions where ligand binding to one site of a molecule depends on the ligand binding to the other sites. the first quantitative determination of the dynamic properties of cooperative binding was proposed by  <cit> . in this work the authors emphasized the significance of the cooperativity by studying the fast dynamics of ca2+ binding to calretenin , which has one independent and four cooperative binding sites. the investigation of cooperative effects of ca2+ binding to cr was performed both experimentally and using mathematical modeling. the authors employed the simplified version of the adair-klotz model  <cit>  to describe the dynamics of the interactions involved in ca2+ binding to cr. this approach was then extended to the binding of ca2+ to cam  <cit> . the models proposed in these studies  <cit>  demonstrated excellent fitting results to the experimental data, in comparison with the previously published models. however, the described approach is rather limited, as it describes fitting instead of providing a mechanistic description. an alternative methodology offered by  <cit>  is not directly applicable from the physical and chemical point of view because the adair-klotz model for sequential ligand binding was utilized  <cit>  whereas binding of ca2+ to ef-hand proteins  is non-sequential  <cit> . given the importance of studying fast ca2+ binding kinetics and the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms, we developed a detailed mathematical model for ligand binding to multisite proteins with both cooperative and independent binding sites.

mathematical modelling of multisite protein kinetics in response to rapid ligand changes presented in this paper provide new insights into the mechanism of conformational kinetics of multisite proteins in complex with variable number of bound ligands for the two distinct physiological situations described:i) when the ligand concentration significantly exceeds protein concentration,

ii) when the total amount of ligand is conserved and comparable with the protein concentration.



in the first case, the buffering effects are negligible whereas in the latter, the ligand-protein interactions have a significant impact on the amount of available ligand and the binding kinetics. in this work, the equations for the dependence of the characteristic time constants and the temporal distribution of individual conformations as a function of the ligand concentration, the number of binding sites and the binding affinities have been derived. the impact of the number of binding sites, temporal effects on conformations, and regulation by multisite proteins of their effector proteins have been investigated by employing the developed models. the analysis of the ligand-multisite protein mediated regulation of effector proteins suggests that significant degree of selectivity in regulation can be achieved by a single ligand by employing mechanisms described in this study.

RESULTS
a new model for multisite protein ligand binding kinetics
the majority of studies of the activation of multisite proteins consider only the ligand concentration-dependent profiles. one of the interesting questions about these multisite proteins is how temporal alterations of ligand concentration contribute to their function. the shape of distribution of multisite proteins in complex with variable numbers of bound ligand is known or can be experimentally elucidated in many cases . however, the role of temporal transitions caused by fast alteration of ligand concentration on multisite proteins and on multisite protein-regulated target proteins remains unclear. it is reasonable to assume that there can be at least two distinct mechanisms of fast ligand alteration-mediated effects exhibited in two distinct system scenarios: i) the ligand concentration is significantly greater than the multisite protein concentration, ii) the ligand is comparable with the multisite protein concentration. in the first scenario ligand binding to multisite protein leads to insignificant changes of free ligand, whereas in the second case, free ligand concentration can vary substantially when ligand molecules bind to the multisite proteins. this paper describes the development of the two models, which address these distinct physiological situations.

the model for abundant ligand concentration
in this model we describe physiological situations where the ligand concentration significantly exceeds the multisite protein concentration. in a previous study  <cit>  the authors analyzed functions for the probability of an individual site being in the bound or non-bound state and a function giving the probability of a multisite protein being in a complex with different number of bound ligands  and  in methods)  <cit> . to investigate the kinetics of the multisite protein ligand interactions the present study extends the previous model to consider the ligand concentration as a function of time  and  in methods). the solutions for the individual sites to be in a particular state were obtained for those cases where ligands are subject to rapid changes between steady-states  and  in methods). due to the large number of sites involved, knowledge of the state probability distribution for individual binding sites allows accurate estimation of the dynamics of the total concentration of bound ligand in response to a jump in free ligand concentration  in methods).

in order to gain more insights into the distribution of the intermediate protein conformations  we investigated the case of a multisite protein with identical binding sites  in methods). while this case is a relatively rare occurrence in living cells, it enables insight into the role that the number of binding sites plays in cellular signalling. there are several examples of protein families that have variable number of ligand binding sites either due to their structural properties or by them forming large tertiary complexes. for example members of the ca2+ family of binding proteins can differ in the number of ligand binding sites  <cit> . the most ubiquitous ca2+-binding protein, calmodulin , contains four ca2+ binding sites as does troponin   <cit>  and calcineurin phosphatase   <cit> . however the number of functional ca2+ binding sites can vary from two to ten as in the protease, calpain  <cit>  or even more in other cases  <cit> . to investigate the role that the number of ligand binding sites plays in multisite kinetics, the ligand concentrations, at which the intermediate conformations reach their maximum values,  in methods) and the corresponding magnitudes for those conformations  in methods) were estimated.

figure  <dig> shows the maximum protein conformations in complex with one, two and three ligands as a function of the number of binding sites  in methods). the graph demonstrates that the magnitude of the ligand-multisite complexes decreases dramatically as the number of binding sites increases. the presented results suggest that the relative magnitude of individual intermediate conformations decreases as the number of binding sites increases. this in turn results in subtler regulatory effects of those proteins with larger number of ligand binding sites. for example, in cam that has four binding sites for calcium  <cit> , the presence of four sites leads to the increased multifunctionality of this protein due to the additional regulatory properties of intermediate conformations  <cit> . however, as an exception some forms of cam have six binding sites  <cit> . in this case, according to fig.  <dig> the magnitude of intermediate conformations significantly decreases compared to the case of four binding sites, resulting in decreased regulatory properties of the protein. the presence of more than one binding site results in increased multifunctionality of the protein but at the same time leads the decrease of the regulatory effects. thus, it seems that there is an “optimal” number of binding sites, which have been developed during the evolution, for instance four calcium binding sites in cam.fig.  <dig> the effect of the number of binding sites on intermediate conformations. the maximum magnitude of protein conformations in complex with one, two and three ligand molecules are shown as a function of the total number of binding sites. the relative amount of ligand binding by conformations bound to a specific number of sites clearly diminishes as the number of sites grow



next, the ligand concentrations for half maximum effective ligand concentrations, u <dig>  and un <dig> , for the apo- and saturated multisite protein conformations when the protein species equals 50 % of the total concentration were estimated  in methods). this solution shows that the ligand concentration for the half maximal protein activity, known as ec <dig>  would be equal to the equilibrium dissociation constant k  for proteins with one binding site only . figure 2a shows the dependence of u <dig> /k and un <dig> /k, on the number of binding sites. the model predicts that there is a significant change in the required ligand concentration un <dig> /k for the fully bound conformation, while u <dig> /k does not change with time.fig.  <dig> model predictions for the half-maximal effective ligand concentrations as a function of the number of binding sites and ligand concentration. a. the dependence of the half-maximal effective ligand concentration, u

in the previous study the authors reported on the regulatory importance of the distribution of individual multisite protein conformations  <cit> . here calculations  in methods) are presented for the half-width between the half-maximal effective ligand concentrations u <dig> /k as a function of the ligand concentration for the intermediate conformations  of the proteins with different number of binding sites . the observation of the half-width for the concentrations of intermediate conformations that have a bell-shaped dependence on ligand concentration, enables the range of physiologically plausible concentrations of ligand, where protein functions can be regulated by intermediate conformations to be obtained. for example, in fig. 2b the half-width range of calcium concentrations is approximately from - <dig> to  <dig> on the logarithmic scale, which corresponds to 10-7m-10-5m due to the fact that the affinity of calcium binding sites in cam is approximately 10-6m  <cit> . interestingly, the range 10-7m-10-5m corresponds to the physiological range of intracellular calcium concentrations in cardiac muscle cells  <cit> . within this range of calcium concentrations, the switching between calcium channel opening and closure takes place  <cit> .

the difference an between ligand concentrations u <dig> /k and u <dig> /k for the saturated multisite protein conformations, when the protein species are equal to 90 % and 10 % of the total concentration, as a function of the ligand concentration for proteins with different number of binding sites is shown in fig. 2c and d respectively. the determination of an allows an understanding as to how an increase of the number of binding sites n affects the steepness of the dose-response curve . it can be seen from fig. 2c and d that with an increase of n, the width an decreases while the steepness increases and shifts to the range of higher ligand concentrations u/k. the greater steepness of the dose-response curve caused by the presence of increasing number of binding sites  may result in the switch-like response and ultrasensitivity of the protein activation  <cit> . for instance, the steepness of cam activation defines the threshold properties for the switching of erythrocyte aggregation and deformability from one steady-state to another  <cit> .

equation  for the total amount of bound ligand in the case of multisite protein with identical binding sites, can be used to estimate the amount of bound ligand when the ligand concentration is equal to the equilibrium dissociation constant . our model predicts that the ligand concentration for the half maximal protein activation, ec <dig>  is equal to the equilibrium dissociation constant k for any number of bound sites for a multisite protein with identical binding sites.

figure  <dig> shows the calculations for the temporal characteristics of the apo- and fully bound species. figure 3a and b show that the temporal shapes of the apo- and fully bound conformations  in methods) in response to a ligand change are similar to the steady-state dependence of the same conformations on ligand concentration  <cit> . the kinetic parameters, τ <dig>  and τ <dig>  can be estimated as the time required to reach 50 % of the total concentration . the described kinetic parameters have been investigated as a function of the initial and final ligand concentrations  in methods). our analysis reveals a reduction of the time constant, τ <dig> , of the apo- conformation with the reduction of the initial ligand concentration and an increase of the final ligand concentration. however, the dependence of the characteristic time τ <dig>   showed an unexpected bell shaped dependence on the final ligand concentration compared to the simpler monotonic dependence for τ <dig>  . the model predicts that there is an “optimal” ligand concentration for the saturation effect to take the longest time .fig.  <dig> temporal characteristics of the apo- and fully bound species in response to a ligand jump. the dynamics of the concentration of proteins was investigated for apo-  and fully bound  forms in response to the non-dimensional ligand concentration change from u

t, to gain half of the growth in concentration. these kinetic parameters then were subject to the investigation as a function of the initial  and final  ligand concentrations. the presented analysis clearly demonstrates the bell shaped dependence of τ
 <dig>  on the final ligand concentration



the bell shaped dependence of τ <dig>  for a protein with four binding sites, for example cam  <cit> , on final ligand concentration shown in fig. 3d appears to be related to the presence of intermediate conformations with one, two and three bound sites. in a single site molecule , for example crystalline bovine β-trypsin  <cit>  that is characterized by the absence of intermediate forms, τ <dig>  depends on u1/k monotonically, i.e. there is no bell shaped dependence, as is evident from eqs. . in cam , the activation of intermediate conformations takes extra time, which affects τ <dig> . this activation precedes the activation of the saturated form in time, and also as u1/k increases, i.e. the intermediate conformations are more prevalent for smaller values of u1/k, and the stationary distribution shifts towards the saturated form for larger u1/k. as a result, an increase of u1/k leads to an increase of the contribution of the kinetics of the intermediate complexes to the overall dynamics, and hence to an increase of τ <dig> . for larger u1/k the role of the intermediate conformations is less important and overall speed-up dominates, hence τ <dig>  decreases. thus the model predicts that there is an intermediate ligand concentration, at which the kinetics of the fully saturated form, represented by τ <dig> , is the slowest.

the affinities of binding sites differentially affect the kinetic responses of intermediate conformations
the proposed model has been employed to investigate the ligand jump-dependent kinetics of both saturated and non-saturated conformations. initially, an idealized model of a multisite protein with identical binding sites was used to investigate the impact of ligand concentrations on the multisite protein kinetics. however, in living cells there are very few proteins  that have identical ligand binding sites. therefore the model was extended to examine the implications of variations in binding site affinities on the predicted concentration-response profiles.

figure  <dig> shows the dependence of the time point τmmaxk− when the intermediate protein conformations reach the maximum as a function of magnitude of ligand jump  in methods). it can be seen from eqs.  that τ1maxk−, τ2maxk− and τ3maxk− do not exist for u1/k< <dig>  u1/k <  <dig> and u1/k <  <dig>  respectively. under these special cases, where the ligand concentration u1/k is not sufficient for the concentrations of the intermediate conformations to reach their maximal values, these concentrations monotonously grow to their respective steady-state levels. according to eq. , the values u1/k< <dig> u1/k <  <dig> and u1/k <  <dig> correspond to the three individual intermediate conformations with one, two and three bound sites respectively.fig.  <dig> characteristic time required for intermediate conformations to reach their maximum levels as a function of the step change magnitude. the analysis shows that the non-dimensional time  required for reaching the maximum level of the intermediate species, is inversely proportional to the concentration of the applied ligand u
1/k. this effect is due to the growing abundance of the free ligand concentration available for faster interaction with the multisite protein



to investigate the impact of the dissociation constants of individual binding sites we employed the multisite protein model  with marginally  and significantly different association constants . the main result that follows from the analysis of the intermediate conformation curves is that the affinities of the different binding sites mainly affect the magnitudes of corresponding protein conformation. for example, the conformation of a multisite protein corresponding to the one ligand bound state is present in lower concentration if the affinity of the binding centre is lower. however the overall shape of the concentration dependent profile has not changed. this property is very similar to the case of steady-state dependence on the ligand concentration. the only difference is that the bell shape dependence on time during the kinetic response is partially skewed. however, significant variation in affinities changes the magnitude, and also leads to the asynchronous kinetics of the intermediate conformations.fig.  <dig> kinetics predictions for multisite protein species with marginally different association constants. the kinetics of multisite protein species was investigated for the intermediate  and fully bound  forms. the calculations show that the final level of the multisite protein species are defined by the ligand concentration after the step change. it is very clear that the fully bound species are not saturated and most of the ligand is distributed among species bound to fewer ligands. however, step change application of ligand with much higher concentration from u

the effects of cooperativity in ca2+ binding to cam
in order to investigate the influence of cooperativity, we chose a well-characterized protein, cam, as the model object. the cam protein contains two independent ef-hand globular domains, with two binding sites  <cit> . the sites within each of the domains cooperatively influence each other. it has been reported that cooperative binding occurs between two neighbouring sites within the n- and c- terminal domains of cam  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the model predictions for cam where we assume that the molecule has two independent domains, with two identical cooperative sites. in the first domain the affinity of one site changes from k1 =  <dig>  μm to k1c =  <dig>  μm if the other site is occupied and in the second domain the affinity changes from k2 =  <dig>  μm to k2c =  <dig>  μm  in methods)  <cit> . figure 7a and b show the influence of cooperativity on the steady-state concentrations of cam with certain number of bound sites. the presence of cooperativity shifts the dose-response characteristics along the ligand concentration axis and changes the magnitude of intermediate conformations allowing more developed selective regulation of the activity of cam. the investigation of the dynamic properties of co-operativity in cam  for intermediate, apo- and saturated species revealed that the cooperativity influences the magnitudes of time-dependent characteristics. the proposed model predicts that the cooperative binding leads to more pronounced selective effects for intermediate conformations and higher differences between the initial and steady-state levels for the apo- and saturated forms.fig.  <dig> comparative analysis of cooperative versus non-cooperative ca2+ binding to cam. two mathematical models for ca2+-cam interactions are compared under the assumptions for the presence and absence of cooperative binding. the comparison between the two scenarios was performed under steady state conditions ,  and in response to a step change in ca2+ concentration , . the model predicts that the cooperativity influences the maximums of the concentrations for the intermediate forms  as well as the steady-state levels of apo-  and fully saturated forms . however, the difference observed in the distribution of the conformation species in the presence and absence of the cooperative binding is quantitative while the overall shape of the distributions remains unchanged. due to this finding the following model analysis was performed without cooperative binding assumptions



the results of the present analysis suggest that cooperativity plays an important role in the regulation of the activity of multisite proteins by allowing wider possibilities for selectivity. however, the presence of cooperativity leads to quantitative rather than qualitative changes in the system. the introduction of cooperative binding is crucial for the experimental data fitting but at the same time brings further complexity to the system, which does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. as a result of this, further analysis was carried out without considering this effect.

the model for comparable ligand and protein concentrations
the previous sections considered the physiological case where the ligand concentration was above saturation level meaning that the ligand-multisite protein interactions did not affect the availability of the ligand. here the case when the amount of ligand is limited is considered. this can occur in cases when the ligand concentration level is comparable to the multisite protein availability. the model predictions show the relative redistribution of the ligand in the free and bound states. the responses of a multisite protein with four identical binding sites to ligand concentration step change  and  in methods) for two different protein concentrations, lt/k =  <dig> and lt/k =  <dig>  were studied . instead of considering absolute ligand concentrations, the approach considered ratios of the ligand concentration to the affinities of the binding sites. a borderline case where the free ligand concentration is barely affected by interaction was considered  as well as a smaller total ligand concentration where the free ligand is nearly exhausted as a result of buffering by the multisite protein . the comparison of the free ligand concentration  and  in methods) for these two cases is shown in fig. 8e. the model predicts that the strongest effect of the ligand availability can be observed for the multisite protein conformations with three and four  bound ligands. a possible explanation for this phenomenon may be that the multisite protein conformations, which form complexes with smaller number of ligand molecules by definition, do not require significant amount of ligand and as a result are not strongly affected under conditions when the free ligand is limited. whereas the multisite protein interactions with the larger number of ions occur after the significant amount of ligand is “used up” to form the intermediate conformations, however is still required for conformations with larger number of ions. as a result the final levels of the conformations with three and four ions are affected. it can also be seen from fig.  <dig> that the shapes of the intermediate conformations time lines are skewed.fig.  <dig> the comparison between the cases where the free ligand concentration is barely affected by interaction and exhausted as a result of buffering. the kinetics of multisite protein species alterations in response to step change in ligand concentration from u

figure 9a shows the model predictions for the characteristic time required for intermediate protein conformations with one, two and three bound ligands to reach their highest concentrations in response to a step change in ligand concentration  in methods). the model predicts that the characteristic time τ <dig> , required for the apo- form to reach its half growth level monotonically decreases with the increase of the total ligand concentration. however, the characteristic time constant τ <dig> , which represents the saturated conformation reveals a distorted bell shaped dependence on ligand concentration  in methods). this bell shaped dependence, which was also observed in fig. 3d, can also be explained by the presence of intermediate conformations. the distortion of the bell shape in fig. 9b appears to be due to the ligand consumption that is included into the consideration in this section and was not considered in fig. 3d. this result may be significant for the dynamics of cam activation as our model predicts that with an increase of the total ligand concentration, the limited amount of ligand leads to an additional increase of τ <dig>  compared to the case without the ligand consumption. the model, therefore, predicts possible transient differences in multisite protein signal transduction in response to fast transient kinetics of multisite proteins.fig.  <dig> model predictions for the time required for multisite protein conformations to reach their maximal and half growth concentrations. the non-dimensional characteristic times, τ

discussion
in this paper we analysed multisite protein kinetics in response to rapid changes in ligand concentrations. the model for multisite protein kinetics for variable number of bound ligands was developed for two physiological cases: when the concentration of ligand is much higher  <cit>  and when it is comparable with the concentration of the multisite protein  <cit> . the results obtained by the proposed model allow for an accurate interpretation of the experimental data for the concentration of multisite proteins such as cam, tnc, can and other ca2+ dependent secondary messengers regulated by ca2+ ions. the kinetic effects in response to ligand binding  <cit> , required for understanding of pathway regulation, can be interpreted by the presented model.

the approach developed in this project is applicable to a number of areas of kinetic experiments. one of them is widely used techniques to study chemical kinetics using the pressure jump technique  <cit> . according to our model, the effects induced by rapid change in pressure leading to the change in protein-ligand interactions  <cit> , can be interpreted and explained by the alteration in the affinities of the binding constants of multisite proteins. the time dynamics of the individual multisite protein species can offer new insights into the underlying biophysical mechanism of ligand-protein interactions in response to fast change.

our model shows that the concentration of intermediate conformations as a function of time represents skewed bell shapes. we found that as the protein concentration rises, free ligand concentration becomes exhausted  <cit> . this result is consistent with experimentally observed ca2+-cam-dependent inhibition of myosin motor function  <cit> . the results obtained by this model increase our understanding of differential activation of protein phosphatase 2b   <cit>  and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii   <cit>  kinetics. pp2b binding increases the affinity of cam for its targets  <cit>  and, therefore, is likely be activated by low amounts of calcium.

the presented model offers a new tool for the interpretation of transient kinetics experiments performed by the flash photolysis and stopped-flow techniques . availability of a caged analogue of the necessary reactant is considered as one of the biggest problems of flash photolysis  <cit> , which can be overcome by employing the proposed model with the low amount of protein. a less obvious area of application for this methodology is the kinetics of proteins with multiple phosphorylation sites . this work shows that the highly versatile intracellular multifunctionality of multisite proteins is achieved not only by the order of ligand-protein interaction and the number of bound ligands, but also by temporal regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the developed in this study models for the kinetics of the multisite ligand-receptor binding for the two physiological cases, where the ligand concentration is abundant and comparable with the protein concentration, make universal predictions for the temporal distribution of multisite protein conformations in complex with variable numbers of ligands. the strongest effect of the ligand availability is observed for the multisite protein conformations with larger numbers of bound ligands. the two models show that the concentration of individual multisite protein conformations changes with time nonlinearly and that the temporal distribution for the concentrations of the intermediate conformations represents skewed bell shapes. the models derive the characteristic times and the dynamics for the kinetic responses elicited by a ligand concentration change as a function of ligand concentration and the number of ligand binding sites. the developed models allow for a novel and accurate interpretation of concentration and pressure jump-dependent kinetic experiments. our models are applied to study the kinetics of calmodulin, however the models also provide universal predictions and allow us to extend the understanding of a large number of multisite binding-regulated circuits and the mechanisms underlying dynamic ligand-dependent regulation of multisite proteins.
