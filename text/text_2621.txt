BACKGROUND
the emergence of novel gene functions is an essential driving force behind the evolution of species. many molecular mechanisms have been described that contribute to this process including gene duplication, exon shuffling, retroposition, transposable element insertion, lateral  gene transfer, and gene fusion/fission events  <cit> .

one of these mechanisms, transposable or mobile elements, are segments of dna encoding genes that assist in dna excision, replication and integration of the elements into new regions of the genome. until recently transposable elements  have been considered parasitic or selfish dnas that contribute little to the host organism  <cit> . these elements generally exist as neutrally evolving inactive dna remnants that are epigenetically silenced by the host genome to prevent transcription and subsequent transposition  <cit> . such elements are therefore subject to little selective pressure and subsequently acquire sequence variation  over time. however, it has recently been shown that some tes escape host cell silencing to become 'domesticated' by host genomes resulting in the formation of novel genes  <cit> . such domesticated elements are involved in many cellular and developmental functions including placental development, viral resistance, chromatin structure, dna recombination and repair, gene regulation, apoptosis and brain development  <cit> . given these facts, it appears that a complex evolutionary interplay exists between genomic silencing of transposon elements to prevent their proliferation, and co-option of transposon-encoded proteins to provide novel cellular functions in higher eukaryotic genomes.

in an attempt to understand and identify the molecular mechanism/s of domestication we have examined the number of such genes in the human and mouse genomes and analysed the features of their genomic insertions sites. we classified each according to gene/promoter structure, degree of conservation, expression profile, and transposable element type.

whereas previous studies have suggested that the majority of transposable element domestication arises via a gene fusion event or genomic insertion in close proximity to a cryptic promoter  <cit> , our analysis has revealed that only a small proportion of co-opted te-derived genes arise from such events. rather, we have identified a significant number of domesticated tes that share a promoter with a neighbouring gene in a head-to-head, or bidirectional arrangement. we have further examined the role of cpg rich 'inherently bidirectional' promoters in the insertion of foreign elements in recently evolved genes and experimental systems.

RESULTS
domestication of protein-coding transposable elements in mammalian genomes
recent studies have surveyed eukaryotic genomes for the presence of tes that have been co-opted by their host genome  <cit> . in the human genome it has been estimated that approximately  <dig> % of all protein-coding genes contain  part of a te, however little data are available related to the potential mechanisms leading to te co-option  <cit> . we have utilised updated genome annotation and genome-wide expression data to expand this analysis to further examine the co-option status of inserted transposable elements by mammalian genomes . since a high proportion of protein-coding genes in both humans and mouse contain small insertions from common tes such as alu and b <dig> type elements, we limited our survey to genes with protein coding regions of at least 30% sequence length homology to a known te .

using these selection criteria, we identified a total of  <dig> transcribed protein-coding genes within the human genome derived from previously characterised tes. these can be grouped into three main classes: dna transposons, retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses. the most abundant group are dna transposons  followed by retrotransposons  and endogenous retroviruses  . of note, all of these elements contain intact open reading frames and evidence of transcriptional activity, suggesting production of functional proteins. . fewer te-derived genes were identified in the mouse genome . however, a similar distribution of te classes was observed for mouse with  <dig> dna transposons,  <dig> retrotransposons and  <dig> endogenous retroviruses.

a link between te domestication and bidirectional promoters?
te insertion into downstream regions  of annotated genes to create a chimeric gene has previously been reported   <cit> . of the  <dig> potential domesticated te genes we have identified in the human genome, only  <dig>  are likely to have arisen in this manner. thus, 84% of the domesticated genes show an alternative mechanism of insertion. further analysis of the genomic landscape associated with this subclass revealed a disproportionate number that appear to share a common promoter arranged in an antisense orientation .

to test the frequency of this arrangement we compared the incidence of te-associated bidirectionality with the human genome average of bidirectional gene pairs. exact estimates of the number of bidirectional genes in the human and mouse genomes vary, between  <dig> %  and 11% of human genes , and  <dig> % of mouse transcriptional units  exist as part of a bidirectional pair, with transcription start sites less than  <dig> kb apart  <cit> . using similar criteria we observed that  <dig> of the  <dig>  co-opted te genes exist as part of a bidirectional pair in humans which is significantly greater than the genome average of such an arrangement; Ï‡ <dig> =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  . the mouse genome also contains a significantly higher proportion of co-opted genes in bidirectional pairs  when compared with the genome average  . in order to test whether the 30% te similarity cut off used in our analysis preferentially identified genes with a reduced cdna length relative to the genomic average, we calculated the mean cdna length of bidirectional gene pairs relative to the genome-wide average. no significant difference between the two data sets was observed with a genome-wide mean cdna length of  <dig> bp   <cit>  and a mean cdna length of bidirectional pairs of  <dig> bp .

between 77%  <cit>  and 94%  <cit>  of bidirectional promoters in the human genome contain a classical cpg island, defined as a stretch of dna over  <dig> bp, with a g + c content of over 50%, and an observed/expected ratio of cg dinucleotides of over  <dig>   <cit> . this appears to be a specific feature of mammalian genomes  <cit> . the corresponding proportion for unidirectional promoters in the human genome is between 38%  <cit>  and 60%  <cit>  depending on whether annotated genes or transcriptional units are used as a reference. cpg island length of bidirectional promoters appears significantly longer than unidirectional promoters  <cit> . however cpg island size is not strictly a determinant of bidirectionality status  <cit> . in human and mouse genomes we found that all cases of bidirectional promoters associated with a domesticated te contain a cpg island that shows some overlap of the first exons of both the host and domesticated te genes .

inherent bidirectionality and open chromatin of cpg islands - a chink in the defensive armour
most cpg islands within the human genome exist in an unmethylated state and are associated with constitutively active genes  <cit> . such a state is invariably associated with an open chromatin structure that is anticipated to render the underlying dna accessible to chromatin-associated proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation. we postulated that the majority of promoters containing cpg islands within mammalian genomes show inherent bidirectional capacity which, coupled with their open chromatin state, renders them ideal target sites for the integration and subsequent transcription of tes arranged in an antisense direction to the endogenous partner gene. we anticipated that the constitutive transcriptional state of the promoter region of the founding member of the pair has the additional effect of protecting the incoming parasitic dna element from the endogenous gene silencing machinery that would normally render such insertions inactive and prevent their expression following integration.

to test whether cpg islands associated with unidirectional transcription units have inherent properties permissive for bidirectional transcription, we investigated the nature of trapped loci that have been characterised as part of the international gene trap consortium  in mouse embryonic stem cell lines  <cit> . we screened the database for the presence of anti-sense transcripts which overlapped or were upstream of exon  <dig> of an annotated gene. these were aligned for position and direction within the mouse genome. we selected anti-sense gene-trap tags according to the following selection criteria; overlapping with exon  <dig> or the predicted promoter, and within  <dig> kb upstream of the annotated transcription start site or cpg island. sequence tags located downstream of the annotated transcription start sites and known bidirectional genes were excluded from analysis.

from a total of  <dig> ensembl genes trapped by the igtc as of 8-may- <dig> we identified  <dig>  annotated genes or transcriptional units  associated with anti-sense trap-tags . of these, seven contain more than one tag in the anti-sense direction, and two loci are tagged with more than one type of gene-trap vector. similar to the bi-directionally co-opted human and mouse tes, all of the genes associated with anti-sense trap tags have an associated cpg island. further evidence in support of antibiotic resistance gene cassette rescue by anti-sense transcription is the splicing of the resulting anti-sense transcript tags or rare ests, as observed for the daxx, kif2a and uba <dig> genes. cap analysis gene expression  tags indicative of potential anti-sense transcription start sites  <cit>  were also found at most sites of bidirectional gene-trap insertions .

a see additional file  <dig> for more details.

b cap analysis of gene expression  tags were scored within  <dig> kb of the consensus start site of transcription. sense and anti-sense cage tags are orientated with respect to the listed trapped gene.

further data supporting an inherent bidirectionality of 'unidirectional' gene promoters in the human genome has also been described  <cit> . of  <dig> random nonbidirectional promoters assayed for transcriptional activity in vitro, 52% were active in both directions. in contrast, 90% of  <dig> assayed bidirectional promoters were active in both directions. data from this study also suggests that bidirectional promoters share a common dna region necessary for transcription in both directions and therefore exist as inseparable functional units  <cit> .

in combination, these data demonstrate the inherent capacity for bidirectional transcription of cpg island-associated promoters in mammals, adding support to our hypothesis that such sites are suitable for the opportunistic insertion and expression of foreign te transcriptional units into mammalian genomes.

tigd <dig>  a recently domesticated dna-based transposable element
tigd <dig> is an example of a recent co-opted transposable element present in human and chimp genomes as part of a bidirectional gene pair. dna sequence analysis reveals that tigd <dig> retains the conserved catalytic dde/d core but lacks one of the terminal inverted repeats necessary for transposition   <cit> . to further delineate the extent of conservation and estimate the time of acquisition of this element in evolution, we searched available genomic sequence datasets or performed pcr analysis on the intergenic junction region between the tigd <dig> and eif4e <dig> genes in a panel of primate and other mammalian genomic dnas. tigd <dig> was detected in all primate species including human, pan troglodytes , pan paniscus , gorilla gorilla, pongo pygmaeus , macaca mulata , macaca nemestrina , saguinus labiatus , ateles geoffroyi , otolemur garnetti  and lemur catta  . however, tigd <dig> is absent in other mammalian groups examined including the tree shrew, tupaia belangeri  and the little brown bat, myotis lucifugus , the next closet representative orders to primates. therefore tigd <dig> domestication occurred concurrently with the divergence of the primate lineage between  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

murine bidirectional endogenous retroviruses
the friend virus susceptibility gene  confers resistance against the murine leukaemia virus in mice  <cit> . this endogenous retrovirus appears to have been a recent co-option event, since it is not present in the rat genome. it shares homology with the gag domain of other endogenous mammalian retroviruses, especially the mouse muerv-l . fv <dig> exists in a bidirectional pairing with the d4wsu114e gene . although endogenous retroviruses are generally flanked by 5' and 3' ltr sequences , no such promoter ltr elements appear to have contributed to the insertion and retention of this endogenous retroviral element.

another mouse-specific endogenous retrovirus of unknown function that has recently been co-opted is the 4632419i22rik gene. this exists as part of a bidirectional pair with brip <dig>  . pcr amplification of a panel of rodent species revealed the presence of this gene in all mus species including; m. musculus, m. musculus castaneus, m. spretus, m. famulus, m. caroli, m. pahari, and m. saxicola . these results suggest that 4632419i22rik appeared with the mus lineage, after the divergence of the rattus sensu lato and praomyini  clades  <cit> . similar to the fv <dig> insertion, 4632419i22rik does not include a 5'ltr sequence .

retroposed genes
retroposed genes usually arise from the reverse transcription of a host cell rna with subsequent integration of the intronless cdna into the host genome at a new location, usually in the absence of any upstream regulatory elements. this process is thought to be mediated by the by the reverse transcriptase enzyme of the l <dig> family of retrotransposons  <cit> . to investigate the degree to which transcribed retroposed genes are inserted and maintained through inherent bidirectional activity of cpg island promoters, we examined the genomic location of the top  <dig> transcribed retroposed genes in the human genome  <cit>  . of these, six  were found to be bidirectional  and associated with a cpg island. when we extended our analysis to include the top  <dig> transcribed retrogenes, no additional instances of bidirectionality were observed suggesting a possible link between bidirectionality and transcriptional activity.

genomic environment - pre and post insertion
to examine the genomic landscape before and after gene insertion we chose a group of recently domesticated genes that exist as part of novel bidirectional pairings with a common cpg island promoter. this list comprised two primate-specific genes  and two mouse-specific genes . each ancestral gene promoter was anticipated to be unidirectional. however, two of the four genes display some degree of bidirectional activity as evidenced by cage and/or est tags in species lacking the te insertion element . te insertion and maintenance of coding capacity appears to be associated with an increase in cpg island length for the tigd1-eif4e <dig>  4632419i22rik-brip <dig> and fv1-d4wsu114e promoter regions, whereas the cpg island associated with pgbd4-2900064a13rik/c15orf <dig> remained unchanged following te insertion . increasing size is associated with an increase in the number of cpg dinucleotides in the region closest to the newly co-opted gene. interestingly, this is also associated with an increase in the ratio of antisense: sense  cage tags associated with each cpg island region post te insertion, suggesting an increasing capacity for antisense transcription or increasing transcript stability following te insertion .

co-expression of human te-bidirectional gene pairs
to examine whether the human te-derived bidirectional gene pairs exhibit coordinate expression we performed a correlation analysis using publicly available gnf gene expression atlas  <dig> data on  <dig> human tissues  <cit> . a pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for nine gene pairs where both were included on the array and at least one of which exhibited detectable expression levels following array analysis . of the pairs examined 56%  showed a correlation coefficient of greater than  <dig>  with 33%  showing a correlation value of over  <dig> . this supports previous data showing bidirectional gene pairs are more likely to be co-expressed when compared with random gene pairs  <cit> .

discussion
most of the dna that makes up complex genomes is parasitic in nature, derived from transposable elements acquired throughout evolution. generally, these elements exist as neutrally evolving inactive dna remnants  silenced by the host genome over time. relatively little attention has been paid to a minority of conserved tes that retain protein coding capacity, and are expressed with varying degrees of cell-type specificities. many of these are conserved across phylogeny, suggesting a degree of selective pressure over time that may be indicative of functional importance  <cit> .

the process of "domestication" of such transposable element-encoded proteins is just beginning to be appreciated and begins with a co-option  of a te into the host genome. numerous examples of such elements contributing to the acquisition of specific novel host cell functions have been described in a variety of organisms. some of these examples include regulation of light signalling in arabidopsis  <cit> , mammalian neuronal development  <cit>  and resistance to viruses in mice  <cit> . a recent study highlighting this phenomenon demonstrated that inactivation of a retrotransposon-like element in mice leads to embryonic lethality due to placental defects  <cit> . thus, a complex evolutionary interplay appears to exist between genomic silencing of transposon elements to prevent their proliferation, and co-option of transposon-encoded proteins to provide novel cellular functions in higher eukaryotic genomes.

previous studies have implicated downstream insertion of tes into functional genes as a major mechanism for te rescue , co-option and the formation of chimeric proteins of novel function. there are numerous examples of such insertions in mammalian genomes. however, our analysis suggests that a more common mechanism of genomic te co-option involves insertion of an incoming te upstream of a host gene, oriented in an antisense direction, to form novel bidirectional gene pairs. further, this appears to occur primarily at genes regulated by cpg-containing promoters, with expression and maintenance of te integrity facilitated by the inherent bidirectional transcriptional capacity of cpg promoter regions.

permissive chromatin environment for insertion and transcription of transposable elements
the majority of cpg islands within mammalian genomes exist in an unmethylated state and are associated with constitutively active genes  <cit> . this state is associated with an open chromatin structure that is thought to render the underlying dna accessible to various chromatin associated proteins involved in the transcriptional process. we postulated that the majority of cpg islands within mammalian genomes show inherent bidirectional capacity, which coupled with their open chromatin state, make them ideal target sites for the integration and ectopic transcription of opportunistic parasitic transposable elements. in support of this supposition, our analysis of co-opted tes and rescued gene-trap cassettes revealed that all such insertion events occurred within the vicinity of cpg island regulatory regions. additional support comes from the use of a synthetic dna transposon, sleeping beauty, as a mutagenesis tool in mammalian genomes. from over  <dig>  insertion events mapped in human and mouse cell lines, a small but significant insertion bias towards the 5' upstream regions of genes has been reported  <cit> .

cage tag and other expression analyses have shown that cpg island promoters display a broad and complex distribution of transcription start sites when compared to non-cpg island promoters  <cit>  possibly contributing to the observed inherent bidirectional potential. transcription factors like sp <dig> can bind at multiple sites and protect the cpg island promoter from being silenced  <cit> . in contrast, when a te inserts into a non-cpg island or inactive chromatin region, then it is usually silenced via the cis-spreading of silencing factors and/or the homology-dependent rnai silencing machinery thereby protecting the host genome from the mutagenic potential of subsequent te insertions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have described a major molecular mechanism for co-option of transposable elements by host mammalian genomes involving the antisense insertion upstream of inherently bidirectional promoters. this does not affect the integrity of the ancestral gene partner unlike the related gene fusion events that involve downstream dna insertion into existing genes in the same orientation  <cit> . the net effect of the events we have identified is the acquisition of an additional  gene, predicted to acquire a specific gene expression profile dependent of the nature of the associated cpg-containing promoter. often, the resulting tissue specificity of expression from the incoming dna element is correlated with its bidirectional partner gene. in many instances such genes carry out essential functions within host organisms and have therefore been 'domesticated' by the host during evolution  <cit> . this appears to be frequently associated with the divergence of specific mammalian lineages during evolution. further studies on the role of co-opted tes are warranted to determine the exact roles each plays in mammalian development and speciation.
