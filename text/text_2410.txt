BACKGROUND
choanoflagellates are colourless, free-living, exclusively heterotrophic protists that are characterized by a single anterior flagellum surrounded by a collar of microvilli; and flat cristae in the mitochondria
 <cit> . these unikont flagellates form the sister taxon of metazoans as seen by sequence analyses
 <cit> . within the choanoflagellates, three families were originally distinguished based on morphology: acanthoecidae norris, 1965; salpingoecidae kent, 1880; and codonosigidae kent,  <dig> . recent taxonomic revision based on multigene analysis states that the class choanoflagellatea kent,  <dig> comprises two orders: 1) craspedida, with a single family salpingoecidae ; and 2) acanthoecida, with the families acanthoecidae and stephanoecidae
 <cit> . choanoflagellates normally constitute  <dig> to 40% of the average heterotrophic nanoflagellates  biomass in oxygenated pelagic habitats
 <cit> . they have also been detected in hypoxic  water masses
 <cit>  and can constitute a significant proportion of total hnf biomass, reaching for example 10–40% in hypoxic water masses of the baltic sea
 <cit> . especially in gotland deep, the biomass of exclusively aloricate choanoflagellates can clearly exceed 40%
 <cit> . however, to date, few choanoflagellate species have been successfully cultured
 <cit> , and none for hypoxic environments, limiting knowledge on the ecology of this ecologically relevant protist group.

clone library based approaches have produced many novel sequence types during the last decade, enhancing our knowledge of protist species richness and diversity
 <cit> . however, morphological and quantitative data of microscopical life observations and cell counts are often hard to match with such environmental sequences. in some recent cases it has been possible to assign new described species to novel protistan lineages only known from culture-independent sequence investigations
 <cit> . many environmental sequences  in public databases cluster within the choanoflagellates. a recent re-analysis of published environmental sequences belonging to this group
 <cit>  provided evidence for only a low correspondence between these sequences and sequences obtained from cultures. clonal sequences from hypoxic environments  have also been found to often cluster within the choanoflagellates. for instance, sequences from the anoxic framvaren fjord
 <cit>  branch off near diaphanoeca grandis ; and clonal sequences found in the hypersaline mediterranean l’atalante basin constitute the novel cluster f within the acanthoecidae
 <cit> . stock et al.
 <cit>  also detected novel sequences in the redoxcline of the periodically anoxic gotland deep , which branched within the craspedida cluster a
 <cit> . however, only a small fraction of choanoflagellates known at a sequence level have been isolated and maintained in culture to date, and none so far was derived from hypoxic marine environments. thus, the morphology, ultrastructure and physiological strategies of these choanoflagellates from hypoxic environments remain unexplored.

the baltic sea is one of the largest brackish water basins in the world. a stable halocline separates the water column into an upper oxygenated layer and underlying oxygen deficient and anoxic/sulfidic layers in the deeper basins . protist communities inhabiting these oxygen depleted layers have been characterized so far by microscopical counting of stained specimens
 <cit>  and clone library investigations
 <cit> . however, in contrast to well characterized prokaryotic communities inhabiting these zones
 <cit> , little is known on the ecology and ultrastructure of individual protist groups living there.

the aim of this survey was to successfully isolate and cultivate ecologically relevant protist strains from hypoxic water masses of the baltic sea and characterize the morphological and ultrastructural traits that could allow them to succeed in these environments. in the present study we present two successfully cultured choanoflagellate isolates of the genus codosiga, which present mitochondria with tubular cristae and endobiotic bacteria, never seen before for choanoflagellates, which could represent an adaptation to life in an environment with fluctuating oxygen content.

RESULTS
vertical distribution and abundance of choanoflagellates
in  <dig>  an analysis of codosiga spp. and its vertical distribution was conducted through light and electron microscopy  for the whole water column of landsort and gotland deep . the detected codosiga specimens showed a preference for suboxic and anoxic water layers in both sites. in gotland deep the cells were mainly detected in sulfidic waters below the chemocline . the hnf cell counts from the redoxclines in  <dig> and  <dig>  are shown as the abundance of total heterotrophic flagellates and the relative proportion of aloricate choanoflagellates . choanoflagellates were numerically important components in gotland deep, but represented only a small fraction of total hnf in landsort deep . their abundance was highest at suboxic and interface depths ranging from  <dig> to 30% of total hnf counts in gotland deep and about 5% landsort deep.

phylogenetic reconstructions using ribosomal gene sequences
nearly complete 18s rrna gene sequences were obtained for both strain iow <dig> , and strain iow <dig> . additionally, we generated partial 28s rrna sequences for both strains to enable comparison with codosiga gracilis from genbank . the 28s sequences obtained, including the divergent d1-d <dig> regions, possessed a length of  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs for strain iow <dig> and strain iow <dig>  respectively.

strains iow <dig> and iow <dig> belong to the salpingoecidae according to
 <cit>  and branched off with clade  <dig> by carr et al.
 <cit> , and clade a by del campo & massana
 <cit> . the 18s rrna tree  additionally contains environmental sequences from different habitats closely related to clade a. the codosiga sequences form a well supported clade with sequences from hypoxic habitats such as the baltic sea , framvaren fjord, the black sea and sagami bay, japan. the only exceptional sequence in this clade, that was not isolated from hypoxic environment, is aj <dig> from the pacific
 <cit>  which forms the basal branch. we were able to establish cultures for two further strains, iow <dig>  and iow <dig> , whose short 18s rrna sequence fragments are identical to strain iow <dig> .

the phylogenetic tree based on partial 28s rrna gene sequences, excluding the highly divergent d <dig> region, shows a well established branching order in the craspedida and acanthoecida . sequences of our new isolates are closely related to codosiga gracilis atcc <dig>  rendering the genus codosiga monophyletic. strain iow <dig> is more closely related to c. gracilis  than iow <dig> .

cultivation and morphology
choanoflagellate cultures were maintained under oxic conditions. the culture development in both strains was similar during the first 4– <dig> days after inoculation to fresh medium, though strain iow <dig> proliferated one to two days slower under the same conditions, and tends to aggregate to clumps of bacteria. on days  <dig> to  <dig>  strains demonstrated solitary cells on a stalk of different lengths . on days  <dig> to  <dig>  the development of two-cell colonies appeared . such colony types were common for iow <dig>  and are also typical for codosiga gracilis de saedeleer,  <dig> , but with larger cell dimensions. strain iow <dig> normally produced 2– <dig> cell colonies, though occasionally largely colonies were formed.

strain iow <dig> was present as sedentary stalked solitary cells and as colonies. it has a flask-shaped cell with a broad and short neck covered with a very delicate, tightly enveloping, theca . the inconspicuous profile of the theca opening is visible in some cells as “whiskers” at the base of the collar . length of the body is 3– <dig>  μm, width -  <dig> μm . the length of the collar is equal to the body length, the flagellum is approx.  <dig> times longer than the body and the stalk covers up to  <dig> body lengths.

strain iow <dig> was present as sedentary stalked solitary cells and as colonies of 2– <dig> cells . the most typical colonies were two cells on a rather long stalk . the strain has an elongated vase-shaped cell with a narrow and prominent neck, surrounded with a delicate, tightly enveloping, theca  with visible whisker. the body length is 2– <dig> μm, width -  <dig> μm . the length of the collar is equal to the body; the flagellum is  <dig> - <dig> times longer than the body.

the cell shape of both strains is similar to c. gracilis, studied by leadbeater and morton
 <cit> . a contractile vacuole was not visible for cells cultivated at  <dig> ‰ but appeared when the salinity was reduced to 8– <dig> ‰ .

ultrastructure
the electron microscopical investigations revealed an in general typical choanoflagellate cell structure for both strains . as in many others colonial choanoflagellates:  the cells were covered with a thin sheath, which envelopes the whole body and the base of the collar ;  the collar was composed of approximately  <dig> microvilli in both isolates ;  the golgi apparatus lies under the base of flagellum ;  the flagellar apparatus has a long transition zone, a flagellar kinetosome with radiating microtubules, and a non-flagellar centriole, all typical for choanoflagellates ;  a nucleus of vesicular type  is located in the anterior-middle part of the cell; and  other organelles and inclusions are also those common for choanoflagellates. additionally, food vacuoles with bacteria in different stages of digestion were found in the posterior half of the cell, and a contractile vacuole is located at the cell posterior. this latter structure has the typical appearance of a folded reservoir with coated pits and vesicles around it . finally, lipid droplets occur in the cytoplasm of some cells .

in contrast to these similarities, the internal structure of mitochondria—the shape of the cristae—is cardinally different from all other choanoflagellates investigated to date. the cells in both strains have mitochondria with tubular or sac-like cristae . in both types the cristae have tubular or saccular shape . in the strain iow <dig> mitochondria of two types can be seen: with normal matrix and developed cristae , and with light matrix and rare cristae .

another peculiarity is the presence of many intracellular, potentially symbiotic bacteria in the cytoplasm of strain iow <dig>  predominantly in the cell posterior . these prokaryotes are not limited with membranes, instead lying freely in the cytosol, and seem to belong to gram-negative bacteria  due to the two covering membranes . they are represented by at least two types: long narrow  and big flagellated bacteria . the bfb have a set of rather long flagella which are tubular in cross section  and tend to associate with lipid globules .

mode of feeding
live observations of both strains revealed a typical monosiga-type mode of feeding
 <cit> . the feeding pseudopodium arises from the top of the neck outside the collar, grows towards the bacterium on the outer surface of the collar and engulfs the prey producing a food vacuole. these observations were confirmed by cross sections through the collar base . additionally, feeding pseudopodia arising from the side of the neck were found for both strains . this mode of engulfment is typical for codosiga and some other colonial choanoflagellates with a thin sheath around the cell
 <cit> . the presence of two feeding modes is easily explained by the combination of solitary and colonial life styles for both strains: solitary cells feed in monosiga-type mode, and colonial cells feed as other colonial choanoflagellates .

remarks. the species described here could easily be separated from c. gracilis based on their size , the shorter flagellum , the flagellar root microtubules  and the shape of mitochondrial cristae. c. balthica differs from c. minima by possessing intracellular bacteria and based on 18s and partial 28s rrna gene sequences. no 18s rrna sequence of codosiga cultures exists , but the clustering of the 28s rrna tree supports the separation of both our strains from their nearest neighbour, c. gracilis . both species descriptions are deposited in zoobank under urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:8ea52c91-58ce-4ff9-9007-ac9ded267dd <dig>  and urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:df26a642-bd7a-4819-be8c-40b01a1e <dig> .

discussion
putative anaerobic choanoflagellate species have been occasionally detected using microscopical methods
 <cit> . for example, diaphanoeca sp. and acanthocorbis sp. were found in fixed samples from suboxic to anoxic/sulfidic waters of the mariager fjord
 <cit>  but did not grow in anaerobic incubations. in contrast, codosiga species had not been described to date for hypoxic environments.

as shown here, aloricate choanoflagellates  in general are numerically important members of the baltic redoxcline protistan community with a peak at the suboxic zone above the chemocline. their relative abundance was higher in gotland deep  than in landsort deep . the gotland deep is characterized by periodical small-scale mixing events
 <cit>  and frequent lateral intrusions of oxygenated water
 <cit> , which lead to a less stable redoxcline than in landsort deep. nevertheless, both deeps are rather similar concerning salinity, oxygen and sulfide content and should principally be colonized by both species if they are tolerant to anoxic and sulfidic conditions and it requires more samplings to reveal consistent differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of the two species.

the single cell isolations, conducted in  <dig>  gave us the opportunity to isolate and describe strains from these abundant choanoflagellates. on the same cruise, redoxcline samples from gotland deep were collected for rna-based clone library investigations of oxic-anoxic transition zone and sulfidic water depths
 <cit>  which resulted in several 18s rrna clonal sequences highly similar to our c. balthica isolate . rna-based clone libraries can be influenced by different numbers of ribosomal rna molecules depending on cell size, trophic state or rather metabolic activity. because of the small cell size of codosiga spp. we would expect that its contribution in clone libraries of the total protistan community is only minor. however, the high amount of clonal sequences closely related to c. balthica found by stock et al.
 <cit>   indicates in our opinion a high abundance of the corresponding cells at the sampling site. the 18s rrna sequence of c. balthica also was reported via dgge fingerprint techniques from the same habitat in  <dig>  the relevant dgge band was detected only in water depths below the chemocline, representing anoxic/sulfidic water layers until concentrations of  <dig> μm hydrogen sulfide
 <cit> . these data correspond to the vertical distribution of codosiga spp. at the sampling time , where they were mainly found in anoxic depths. additionally, an identical sequence was detected from a dgge fingerprint from landsort deep permanent redoxcline collected at the oxic/anoxic interface in  <dig>  <dig>  overall, our results indicate that at least c. balthica is a permanent and prominent member of the protistan community of gotland and landsort deep redoxclines.

in contrast to this taxon, c. minima was isolated for cultivation from three different redoxcline samples during a cruise in  <dig>  two of these cultures were obtained from gotland deep  while the third isolate came from landsort deep . in contrast to c. balthica, no closely related environmental sequence for c. minima was found in genbank, which is typical for several isolated and cultivated protistan taxa with presumably only minor ecological relevance
 <cit> .

the general ultrastructure of both species described here is similar to that of other investigated “naked” craspedids
 <cit> . however, the singular adaptation of their mitochondria, and, in the case of c. balthica, the acquisition of intracellular bacteria, are very likely strategies gained both species to deal with oxygen depletion.

the cells of c. minima have mitochondria with tubular but developed cristae, while c. balthica has mitochondria of two types: m <dig> and m <dig> . both types of mitochondria have predominantly cristae with a tubular shape, but the type m <dig> shows a reduced number of cristae and an electron translucent matrix. tubular cristae have never been found before in choanoflagellates, even in specially designed experiments to change the shape of mitochondrial cristae with steroids, conducted unsuccessfully on a m. ovata culture
 <cit> . mitochondria with reduced number of cristae were recently classified as anaerobically functioning mitochondria of the class 2
 <cit> . such mitochondria have a reduced enzyme inventory with regard to oxidative phosphorylation and are able to use other electron acceptors than oxygen . the routine growth of our strains under normoxic circumstances in the laboratory shows that the mitochondria of both species can use oxygen without any difficulty. it is not clear at the moment whether the two types/classes of mitochondria in c. balthica coexist permanently or if some of the mitochondria transformed into aerobically functioning ones  during the cultivation under oxic condition. higher numerical reduction of cristae  in c. balthica mitochondria class  <dig> and the abundance of this taxon in oxygen depleted waters support the possibility to use other electron acceptors in response to decreasing oxygen levels in the environment.

prokaryotic endosymbionts are common in protists, particularly in ciliates and dinoflagellates
 <cit> , but had never been observed previously for choanoflagellates
 <cit> . anaerobic ciliates often harbour methanogenic archaeans in close connection to their hydrogenosomes, and eubacteria without connections to the hydrogenosomes
 <cit> . c. balthica clearly does not possess hydrogenosomes and its endobionts are of bacterial nature as recognizable by the second enveloping membrane instead of a cell wall like archaeans . interestingly, the intracellular prokaryotes were not lost during nearly seven years of cultivation under oxic conditions, indicating that this is likely an obligate symbiosis for the choanoflagellate. similar to observations in anaerobic ciliates, the endobionts likely support the choanoflagellate host  during anaerobic metabolism and thus allowed them to colonize oxygen depleted zones that supply high food availability. however, at this time we can not further specify the identity and role of these intracellular prokaryotes.

as noted in the introduction, environmental choanoflagellate sequences are typical constituents of pelagic redoxcline protist communities and have been frequently detected in hypoxic waters via clone libraries
 <cit> . one environment in particular is worthy of mention: although the cariaco basin is globally the most comprehensively sampled redoxcline environment , no sequences belonging to c. balthica or c. minima have been found there. this could be deeply rooted in methodological limitations . alternatively, the higher salinity of the cariaco basin, or other physico-chemical or hydrological parameters, could exclude the two baltic codosiga species from this environment with fully saline conditions. however, these species seem to be relatively insensitive to salinity variations and are highly tolerant to the presence of oxygen and sulfide. they were able to grow in culture at  <dig> ‰  and one sequence related to strain c. balthica comes from deeper hypoxic water layers of the framvaren fjord at about  <dig> ‰,
 <cit> . thus, the possibility that these species represent endemic taxa of the baltic sea region should be taken into consideration and will be tested in further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
both isolated species described here, c. minima and c. balthica, were found within suboxic to anoxic water layers, in the latter case using different approaches and in several years. the species are of interest due to their habitat, from which no choanoflagellate cultures could be obtained yet, their unusual mitochondrial cristae and presence of intracellular prokaryotes in one species. our isolation effort is important in view of the complexity of isolation and cultivation of choanoflagellates species
 <cit>  and of protists that can survive in hypoxic environments in general. the novel c. balthica is ecologically relevant component of the protist community at the sampling sites tested. with its interior , at least c. balthica is potentially able to outcompete less adaptable heterotrophic nanoflagellates and to become abundant in hypoxic parts of the baltic sea. preliminary investigations have shown that c. balthica is able to grow successfully under suboxic conditions in the laboratory, but not c. minima . our next challenges would be  to identify and characterize the functional role of the intracellular prokaryotes of c. balthica, and  to determine the quantitative contribution of both species to the baltic protistan community via fluorescently labelled specific probes. moreover, both cultivated species are ideal model organisms for future studies on temporary anaerobic metabolism using derived mitochondria.
