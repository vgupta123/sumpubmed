BACKGROUND
lesions to the brain, caused by trauma, stroke, or tumors, may lead to a number of functional deficits with dramatic impairment of the life of patients. type and severity of such impairments strongly depend on the brain region affected by the injury: whereas lesions of the prefrontal cortex may cause subtle effects that may even remain unnoticed, injuries of the brainstem always lead to severe impairments or even death .

although the mammalian nervous system has some capacity to regenerate  <cit> , adult neurogenesis in mammals is limited to a few specialized brain regions  <cit> . as a consequence, the regenerative capacity of neuronal tissue falls far short of that of other tissues. this is the reason why most of the impairments resulting from brain lesions still cannot be cured.

on the other hand, neuronal tissue has an extraordinary capacity to reorganize itself. this functional plasticity of the central nervous system allows for some compensation of lost functions through reorganization of undamaged tissue in brain regions adjacent or contralateral to the lesion site . regardless of the limitations of compensatory neuronal plasticity after brain lesions it has been demonstrated that specific training may foster such compensatory plasticity , resulting in improved rehabilitation outcomes in patients with brain damage . how effective such compensatory reorganization may be in restoring lost functions depends, first, on the type of function that is lost or impaired and, second, how specialized the cortical region is with respect to this function. for example, there seem to be fundamental differences in the microarchitecture of neuronal connections between the auditory cortices of the two hemispheres  <cit>  which can be causative for different sound processing specializations and deficits after unilateral auditory cortex  ablation  <cit> . therefore, hemispheric specialization in ac may prevent complete compensation of the functional impairment caused by lesion of one hemisphere by the contralateral hemisphere. the same argument applies even more for restrictions of possible compensatory plasticity in subcortical structures for lost cortical functions, especially for functions that seem to rely crucially on intact cortex. in this context we could demonstrate in a previous study  <cit>  that mongolian gerbils with bilateral lesion of the ac were unable to discriminate between fast amplitude modulations . this was both true for gerbils that received cortical ablation prior to am discrimination training as well as for animals that were pre-trained to full discrimination performance before ac lesion. on the other hand, animals receiving only unilateral cortical ablations show either impairment or improvement of discrimination performance of fast am stimuli dependent on the lesion side and size  <cit> . this difference indicates that the specialization of the two hemispheres might even hinder best performance if they interfere with each other. nevertheless, each performance gain after a lesion comes with a cost, in this case a loss of frequency modulation discrimination performance  <cit> .

knowing the effects on am discrimination performance after simultaneous bilateral and unilateral lesions of the ac we now asked the question, what kind of neuronal plasticity can be found after sequential lesioning of both ac as a model of multiple sequential ischemic insults in human patients. we here report the unexpected observation of a compensatory plasticity in other brain regions that seems to be triggered by the first unilateral cortical ablation with subsequent training and that is able to almost fully compensate for the lost cortical functions after removing the second ac.

RESULTS
audiometric controls
animals were tested for a possible general impact of ac lesion on pure tone behavioral audiometry by comparing hearing thresholds prior to the first  and after the last training session : comparing the post vs. pre training hearing threshold differences we found no significant changes, neither within nor across experimental groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; factor frequency: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; interaction: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). in other words, removing both ac had no impact on auditory evoked behavioral responses measured with the brainstem dependent prepulse inhibition  of the acoustic startle response .

quantification and localization of ac lesions
ablation of ac was performed by thermo-coagulation of parts of the temporal cortex comprising the ac . during surgery, localization of ac within the temporal lobe was estimated according to known landmarks of the cortical vasculature. post lesion mrt scans were used to verify the exact location of the lesion as well as to quantify the ablated volume. an example is given in figure  <dig> 

shown are mrt scans of one sham-lesioned control animal after the first and second surgery , as well as of one animal of the right-left  lesion group . panels in the left column demonstrate the quantification procedure after lesion of the right ac , panels in the right column show the lesion of the left ac . figure 2c and d show single horizontal slices with the insets comprising the lesioned site shown in higher magnification in figure 2e and f. the circumscribed areas in these insets delineate the boundaries of the lesion, with an estimate of the former cortical surface by interpolation of the remaining adjacent cortical tissue. these areas across all slices affected by the ablations were used to calculate the lesion volume . the rostral border of the hippocampus served as anatomical landmark for the verification of the lesion site: lateral to this landmark lays the  <dig> khz iso-frequency contour of the primary auditory cortex . animals where lesions did not include the ac or injured subcortical structures  were discarded from this study . figure 2g and h finally show 3-dimensional reconstructions of the lesioned brain and the removed volume in a representative animal.

the lesion volumes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm <dig> with a grand mean value of  <dig>  mm <dig>  a statistical comparison of 1st vs. 2nd lesion volumes as well as left vs. right ac lesion volumes revealed no significant differences by a 2-factorial anova  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; factor lesion number: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; interaction: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). a summary of all lesion volumes is given in table  <dig> 

am discrimination learning
figure  <dig> shows a summary of the learning progress in the fast am discrimination task  in all three experimental groups based on two different methods of analysis: figure 3a shows the median discrimination performance  with the interquartile range as a function of training session in the three animal groups, in the top panel the sham-lesioned control group  and in the center and bottom panels the data for the lesioned groups left-right  and right-left , respectively. figure 3b depicts the respective data of the same animals, but given as the normalized z-score difference values of mean d’ . while dp is a measure that merely reflects the difference between hit and false alarm responses in total numbers and therefore is potentially prone to individual response bias, the sensitivity index d’ is a measure that is independent of individual response bias. nevertheless, in this study both measures lead to similar results and identical conclusions.

during the first training phase prior to 1st surgery  all groups showed a continuous improvement in dp leveling off around median values of  <dig> to  <dig> jumps at the 10th training sessions  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; lr from day  <dig> to 15: Χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; rl from day  <dig> to 15: Χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). there were also no significant differences between all three experimental groups with respect to learning speed  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) or final dp  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), so that a bias in the training results based on possible interindividual differences between the training groups prior to the first surgery can be excluded. these results were generally confirmed by the second analysis method investigating the d’ values . we found the learning leveling off somewhat earlier than in the previous analyses namely between training session  <dig> and  <dig>  but again no difference in the final d’ across the last  <dig> training sessions  between the three groups could be found  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

after the confirmation that all animal groups started from the same level independent of the analysis method used we compared the different learning parameters of am discrimination over time. in the control group  we found neither any am discrimination change in 6-day dp by friedman-anova  =  <dig> , p = <dig> ) nor changes when comparing the last and first training day before and after each surgery by wilcoxon tests   vs. median day  <dig>  :  <dig> vs.  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; 2nd surgery, median day  <dig>   vs. median day  <dig>  :  <dig> vs.  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). i.e., the surgery alone and the recovery time of one week after each surgery had no impact on the am discrimination performance of the animals. the same was true for group lr : friedman-anova indicated no significant deficit in am discrimination in the 6-day dp  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and wilcoxon test for single day dp around each lesion  vs.  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; 2nd lesion pre vs post:  <dig> vs.  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). we also did not find any significant changes of 6-day dp within the  <dig> days of training between the two lesions when comparing the first and last  <dig> day bins  vs. sessions  <dig> to  <dig> median  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). this was also true for the 6-day dp after the 2nd lesion and the  <dig> day dp at the end of training  vs. sessions  <dig> to  <dig> median:  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). in other words, animals with both unilateral and bilateral lesion of the ac did not show any signs of impairment in dp when removing the left ac first and this effect was constant over the whole training period.

on the other hand, when investigating the 6-day dp of group rl animals  friedman-anova indicated a significant difference between final dp  and the dp at the first  <dig> days after each lesion  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). detailed analysis showed that this effect did not result from the first lesion  vs. sessions  <dig> to  <dig> median:  <dig>  p =  <dig> ) but from the second lesion affecting the left ac  vs. sessions  <dig> to  <dig> median:  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). this was somewhat different for the single day dp around each lesion  vs.  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; 2nd lesion pre vs post:  <dig> vs.  <dig>  p =  <dig> ) where the first lesion had a significant impact on the dp but not the second. independent of these minor differences between single and 6-day dp, we found neither a change of 6-day dp between both lesions  vs. sessions  <dig> to  <dig> median:  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) nor between the 6-day dp after the 2nd lesion and the end of training  vs. sessions  <dig> to  <dig> median:  <dig>  p =  <dig> ). in other words, the dp for am stimuli was not affected when removing the right ac first but impaired  when additionally lesioning the left ac and the animals did not show a significant recovery until the end of training.

a further between-group analysis revealed no significant differences between the groups at each investigated time interval as indicated by kruskal-wallis anovas : h =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; 1st lesion : h =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; 2nd lesion : h =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). so all animals were equally able to perform the task of fast am discrimination independent of their lesion status.

additionally to the investigation of dp we repeated the analyses described above using the d’ values calculated from cr+ and cr-. in general we found the same results as in the analysis of dp . in control animals and in the lr group animals no change in d’ could be found at the three time intervals while in the rl animals a tendency for a reduced d’ value especially after the 2nd lesion emerged. when investigating the changes between the sessions  <dig> to  <dig> vs.  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> vs.  <dig> to  <dig> for each group by t-tests, we found no differences in any of the groups. this was true for the control group  and for both lesion groups . so comparable to the results of the dp analyses, we found a tendency for a performance reduction in am discrimination after the second lesion when lesioning the right ac first and then the left ac without any significant recovery until the end of training. this tendency became significant when pooling both lesion groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and tukey post-hoc tests showed the d’ values after the 2nd lesion  to be significantly lower than before the 1st lesion  with p =  <dig> . nevertheless, we did not find any significant differences when comparing the pooled lesion group with the c animals at the three different time points in a 2-factorial anova  =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; factor session: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; interaction: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

in summary, despite the small discrimination performance loss in the pooled lesion group or in the rl group alone, respectively, animals of all groups were able to discriminate am stimuli after ablation of both acs independent of the analysis method. this was an unexpected result as animals that receive simultaneous bilateral lesion of both acs show a complete loss of dp in this particular am discrimination paradigm, independent of pre-training experience .

to further characterize this surprising discrimination ability we analyzed the cr+ , cr-  and itc  rate of the animals. in figure 4c the cr+ and cr- median values are given for three different 6-day intervals for the three groups. in the control animals  we did not find any significant differences between the 6-day median values taken before and after the 1st lesion and after the 2nd lesion  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; cr-: friedman anova Χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) which was also true for the bonferroni corrected wilcoxon tests performed between all three time intervals . in both lesion groups we found significant differences in cr+ and cr- data with a parallel temporal development: both cr+ and cr- increased over time as indicated by friedman anovas  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; cr-: Χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . right panel group rl; cr+: Χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; cr-: Χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). additional between group comparisons  by kruskal-wallis anova for each time interval showed no significant differences in cr+ or cr- before or after the 1st lesion, but became significant after the 2nd lesion for both cr+ and cr-, indicating that both lesion groups made more cr+ jumps than control animals  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). note that the multiple comparison of mean ranks post-hoc tests was not significant between single lesion groups and the control group, but pooled lesion group vs. control group were significantly different from each other in the mann–whitney u-test with p =  <dig> . nevertheless, in the between groups comparisons only lr lesioned animals showed a significantly higher false alarm rate  compared to c animals  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; multiple comparison of mean ranks lr vs. control: p =  <dig> ).

figure 4d finally depicts the itc rates of the animals of the three groups. again the friedman anova indicated no significant changes in the control group  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) while bonferroni corrected wilcoxon tests  indicated an increased activity after the 2nd lesion when compared with pre lesion values. both lesion groups on the other hand showed an increased itc rate  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; right panel, group rl: Χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) which was especially enhanced after the 2nd lesion as indicated by bonferroni corrected wilcoxon tests when compared with the values before and after the 1st lesion . none of the kruskal-wallis anovas at the three different time intervals showed significant differences between the three groups.

taken together, these last analyses show that removing one ac, regardless of its side, already has effects on hit  rate, false alarm  rate but not on inter trial crossing  activity. removing the second ac increases especially the cr- rates as well as the itc rate. the increase of cr + counteracts the increase of cr- after the first lesion but cannot fully compensate the further increase of jumping affinity after the second lesion which leads to a slight drop in performance.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
a number of studies have addressed the impact of bilateral auditory cortex lesions on auditory processing and perception. in humans, ablations of the auditory cortices in both temporal lobes are rare  <cit>  and usually caused by multiple ischemic insults of the respective brain regions rather than head injury induced traumata . in these cases patients often suffer from cortical deafness  <cit> , although the patients’ specific impairment depends on the exact location and extent of the lesion  <cit>  and possible retrograde fiber degeneration caused by the ac lesion  <cit> . in cases of complete cortical deafness patients are usually able to react to environmental sounds despite being unaware of hearing them  <cit> . this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that cortical deaf patients usually display normal auditory brainstem functions, e.g. normal bera thresholds  <cit> , despite profound to complete sensori-neural hearing loss on pure tone audiometry.

in animal models effects of bilateral ac lesion seem to be comparable to those observed in humans: it has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments that intact ac seems to be crucial for the discrimination of complex auditory sounds like complex tones with a certain pitch  <cit> , species-specific vocalizations  <cit> , or fast am tones likes those used in this report  <cit> . in contrast, simple tasks like pure tone discrimination or discrimination of slow am tones are possible without ac  <cit>  and therefore may rely on normal or only slightly affected auditory brainstem processing  <cit> . in our animal model, this normal auditory brainstem processing is reflected in unchanged hearing thresholds , as our control method  depends on subcortical reflexes  <cit> .

in the present report, the most intriguing and unexpected result is that there seems to be a fundamental difference in auditory impairment induced by sequential bilateral ac lesion compared to simultaneous bilateral lesion: we could demonstrate in an earlier study that simultaneous ablation of acs in both hemispheres leads to a complete loss of the ability to discriminate fast am tones even after pre-training prior to the lesion . a sequential ablation of the two acs with ongoing behavioral training between lesions as conducted in the present report has only very subtle, quantitative effects on discrimination performance  and does not disable the ability of the animals to discriminate such sounds . note that the fact that am discrimination in our paradigm is possible without ac does not imply that ac is not used for the task if it is intact. the slight drop in dp and d’ in both lesion groups can be explained by the increase in cr- that is stronger than the increase in cr+, especially after the second lesion. both observations point to a generally higher activity state of the animals after the ablation of the second ac that is also reflected in increased itc. these effects do not seem to be a result of the surgery itself, as sham control animals showed almost no changes in these parameters. it has been reported that cortical lesions can lead to neuronal disinhibition and hyperactivity  which could explain the heightened bias to jump over the hurdle. independent of the exact neuronal state of the animals, for the explanation of our main finding – the ability to discriminate fast am without an ac – there must be some neuroplastic compensatory mechanisms triggered by or after the first, unilateral ac lesion. this compensation obviously enables the animal to continue to perform on a high level in the discrimination task even after the second ac is lesioned. apparently, these neuroplastic changes occurring in the time between the two lesions do not take place in the contralateral ac, at least not exclusively, because in that case the ability to perform above chance in the discrimination task would get lost after the lesion of this contralateral ac. interestingly the animals in this study do not show an increase  or decrease  in performance dependent on the side of the lesion as described in one of our recent studies  <cit> . this difference is most probably due to the pre-training of the animals in the present report which was not performed in the aforementioned other work. the auditory cortex seems to need training to be able to induce neuroplastic changes elsewhere in the brain to compensate for lost functions.

one may now speculate if these compensatory neuroplastic changes triggered by unilateral ac lesion affect subcortical auditory centers or higher cortical areas. a simple view would suggest that, after ac finally is bilaterally destroyed, projections to higher cortical areas containing auditory information should be disrupted. in this view, subcortical processing, where the auditory input from the periphery is still available, may be responsible for the retained discrimination performance. nevertheless, numerous data demonstrate that sensory processing is not that simple and involves structures outside the sensory pathways, for example frontal and prefrontal areas, limbic structures, temporal association cortices, cerebellar structures  or the habitual learning system . the observation that patients with cortical deafness still show long-latency auditory event-related potentials  <cit>  might point into this direction.

although it is currently not clear whether the compensatory mechanism triggered by the first unilateral ac lesion suggested in this study is also present in humans  <cit> , our result may still open new perspectives for the treatment of patients with ac damage: as most patients suffer from unilateral ac damage first – as our animal model – while cortical deafness due to the lesion of the second ac usually develops after a second ischemia  <cit> , this opens a time window for potential prophylactic treatments to specifically trigger compensatory neuroplasticity. whether such a treatment like the auditory discrimination training applied in our animal model is really needed to trigger such compensatory neuroplasticity will have to be investigated in future studies.
