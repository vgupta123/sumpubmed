BACKGROUND
interest in salicylates has prompted their use for lowering blood glucose in patients with diabetes since  <dig>  <cit> . although salicylate treatment of diabetes never gained wide application, the molecular mechanism of the hypoglycemic activity of aspirin has acquired renewed interest because it inhibits iκb kinase-β   <cit> . from these results, schulman hypothesized that salicylates might prevent lipid-induced activation of the serine kinase cascade involving ikk-β  <cit> : serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate - <dig> by activated ikk-β will decrease the ability of irs- <dig> to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , an important mediator of insulin signaling and action, thus leading to insulin resistance. by reversing ikk-β kinase activation, salicylates might enhance insulin sensitivity. results supporting this proposal include the prevention of lipid-induced insulin resistance by salicylates in ikk-β heterozygous mice and in ikk-β knockout mice without salicylate treatment  <cit> . furthermore, aspirin-treated mice bearing an heterozygous deletion in the gene for the ikk-β exhibited improved insulin sensitivity and reduced plasma glucose levels  <cit> . activation of additional serine kinases promotes the development of insulin resistance by a similar mechanism  and, for some of these kinases, salicylates inhibited their activation and improved the effects of insulin  <cit> . this paper presents evidence of an alternative pathway employed by aspirin and other nsaid to enhance insulin action, by impairing the physiological activation of a specific protein kinase. in cell-free extracts of isolated adipocytes, we have shown that aspirin, naproxen, nimesulide, and piroxicam inhibited camp-mediated pka activation, decreasing pka activity and reducing translocation of hormone-sensitive lipase from cytosol to fat droplets  <cit> .

a number of insulin effects on adipocytes are mimicked by h2o <dig> <cit> , including inhibition of stimulated lipolysis  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that insulin activates nadph oxidase, which produces superoxide that spontaneously dismutates to h2o <dig> <cit> , transiently increasing the concentration of cellular h2o <dig> <cit> , and a role of h2o <dig> as a second messenger has been hypothesized since  <dig> –  <dig>  <cit> . a new wave of data to enlarge the same topic appeared years later, i.e., h2o <dig> is produced by an nadph oxidase  isoenzyme during physiological insulin transduction in adipose cells  <cit> . a substantial advance was made by goldstein’s group, who showed that insulin causes rapid formation of h2o <dig> in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes, a redox signal that enhances the early insulin-stimulated cascade of tyrosine phosphorylation by reversible oxidative inactivation of thiol-dependent protein-tyrosine phosphatase  1b  <cit>  and other enzymes  <cit> , which pointed to a novel regulatory mechanism complementing the early steps in insulin amplification signaling. a more recent report on insulin signaling via h2o <dig> during lipolysis showed that h2o2—either generated by insulin or added—reversibly inhibited the lipolysis rates activated by epinephrine or bt2camp  <cit> . this effect took place by means of the h2o <dig> mediated oxidation of two sulfhydryl groups from the pka holoenzyme: cys  <dig> from regulatory iiα or iiβ subunits, and cys  <dig> from the catalytic α subunit, which formed a disulfide bond that impaired camp activation of the holoenzyme, thus preventing pka-stimulated lipolysis  <cit> . this information together with the inhibition of stimulated lipolysis by nsaid  <cit>  led us to propose h2o <dig> as the missing molecule generated by nsaid in adipocyte plasma membranes. thus, the aim of this paper was to get insight on the molecular bases of insulin-like actions of nsaids.

adipocyte isolation and measurement of lipolysis
to isolate adipocytes with low camp endogenous levels, animals were fasted for  <dig> h as recommended by londos  <cit> . animals were sacrificed by decapitation and the epididymal fat pads were immediately removed. fat pads from two rats were used in each experiment. in brief, krebs-ringer buffer was enriched with  <dig> mm hepes,  <dig>  mm cacl <dig>   <dig> mm glucose,  <dig> nm adenosine, and fatty acid-free bsa either at  <dig> or 4%, as detailed later; ph was adjusted to  <dig> . one gram of minced fat pads was digested in  <dig> ml of collagenase  for  <dig> min at 37°c, with shaking at  <dig> cycles/min in the krebs-ringer-enriched buffer supplemented with 1% bsa. cells were filtered through nylon cloth and washed three times by centrifugation  at  <dig> × g. wet-packed adipocytes were weighed to report glycerol release by wet weight as an index of lipolysis, which was assayed using  <dig> μl of packed adipocytes incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c in a total volume of  <dig> ml of krebs-ringer-enriched buffer supplemented with 4% bsa, in which bt2camp, isoproterenol, catalase, insulin, nsaid, dpi, anti-nox <dig> antibody, cyt c, and agno <dig>  were dissolved to reach the final concentrations indicated in the figures. adipocytes were maintained dispersed during incubation by shaking at  <dig> cycles/min. lipolysis was stopped by transferring tubes from 37°c to an ice bath for  <dig> min. tubes were immediately centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 4°c for  <dig> min. a 300-μl aliquot from the solution lying below the fat cake was utilized to measure released glycerol  <cit> .

measurement of h2o <dig> generation in isolated adipocytes
one hundred μl of packed rat adipocytes were incubated for  <dig> min  at 37°c, with shaking at  <dig> cycles/min in a total 1-ml volume of krebs-ringer-enriched buffer supplemented with 4% bsa in which insulin, nsaid, dpi, cyt c, anti-nox <dig> antibody, and agno <dig> were dissolved to reach the final concentrations indicated in the figures. h2o <dig> generation was stopped by the addition of  <dig> μl of tca  <dig> m, and the tubes were immediately centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 4°c for  <dig> min to measure h2o <dig> with the method of zhou et al.  <cit> , utilizing the amplex red hydrogen peroxide assay kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

nadph-dependent h2o <dig> generation system activity
the procedure described to measure nadph oxidase system activity in adipocytes was followed  <cit> . in brief,  <dig> μl of packed rat adipocytes were suspended in  <dig> μl of ice-cold lysis medium containing  <dig> mm mes ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm cacl <dig>   <dig> mm kcl, and  <dig> μl of protease inhibitor cocktail. cells were lysed after vigorous mixing for  <dig> min in a vortex. lysed cells were spun at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min at 4°c, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate with plasma membrane was suspended in the activation buffer containing  <dig> mm mops, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  mm cacl <dig>   <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  and  <dig> mm nahco <dig>  centrifugation was repeated, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was suspended in the activation buffer supplemented or not with mncl <dig>  guanosine 5′-3-o-triphosphate , nsaid, or insulin, as detailed in the figure legends. adipocyte plasma membranes containing the nadph oxidase system were incubated in activation buffer at 25°c for  <dig> min. then, the samples were centrifuged under the same conditions, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was suspended and washed twice in catalysis buffer containing  <dig> mm mes, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm kh2po <dig>   <dig> mm nan <dig>   <dig> mm fad, and supplemented when indicated with dpi, cyt c, anti-nox <dig> antibody, and agno <dig>  samples were spun again, the supernatant was discarded, and these were suspended in the same buffer without supplements; the catalytic reaction was started with  <dig> μm nadph and incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c. the reaction was stopped by placing tubes in an ice bath for  <dig> min, and a 5-μl aliquot from the mix reaction was employed to measure h2o <dig> using the amplex red hydrogen peroxide assay kit.

RESULTS
role of h2o <dig> on the inhibitory action of nsaid
on the basis of the data available, we propose that the h2o <dig> generated by nsaid is the intermediary that prevents pka-stimulated lipolysis. this putative role of h2o <dig> was explored by adding exogenous catalase to intact isolated adipocytes challenged with bt2camp to activate lipolysis . as expected, the results showed that aspirin, naproxen, nimesulide, and piroxicam at 10– <dig> m inhibited bt2camp-activated lipolysis  . in contrast, catalase significantly enhanced bt2camp-activated lipolysis, either in the absence of the cyclic nucleotide or in its presence, at all concentrations tested . because lipolysis inhibition elicited by the four selected nsaid at 10– <dig> m was observed when glycerol release was activated by 10– <dig> to 10– <dig> m bt2camp, i.e., at concentrations  <dig> –  <dig> -fold higher than the concentration of the aspirin-like drugs  , direct interaction between nsaid and bt2camp can be discarded. furthermore, in all cases, the addition of exogenous catalase impaired nsaid-mediated inhibition of lipolysis .

nsaid increased h2o <dig> generation through a nox system
the next experiment was to test the ability of nsaid to generate sufficient h2o <dig> in isolated adipocytes, in order to amplify and substantiate the inhibitory action of aspirin-like drugs on stimulated lipolysis  <cit> . the selected nsaid employed at 10– <dig> m produced a linear but transient rise in the content of h2o <dig>  reaching a maximum concentration at  <dig> min of incubation followed by its rapid disappearance , indicative of a rapid turnover in the h2o <dig> pool, as expected for a regulatory signal. based on these data, the 10-min incubation period was chosen to conduct further experiments. isolated adipocytes generated h2o <dig> with a similar concentration-response pattern and with a peak at 10– <dig> m for each nsaid . the transient rise in h2o <dig> induced by nsaid is quantitatively similar to that observed with 10– <dig> m insulin , a hormone that follows a redox signal transduction pathway, which reversibly inhibited lipolysis  <cit> . cell membranes prepared from adipocytes were incubated in an enriched medium with nadph to generate h2o <dig> by the nox; under these experimental conditions, nsaid increased the production of h2o <dig> . a concentration-response curve of these compounds in the presence of mn2+ showed an increase in the endogenous synthesis of h2o <dig>  with a peak at 10− <dig> m for nsaid, except for aspirin, for which a value of 10− <dig> m was observed; higher concentrations of nsaid failed to increase h2o <dig> generation further. we have no explanation for this last observation; however, bell-shaped dose response relationships have been previously reported for other nsaid effects , pointing out the diverse and complex action mechanisms of nsaids. on the other hand, the decrease in h2o <dig> production at higher concentrations of nsaids cannot be explained by a toxic effect of nsaids on the cells, since the same type of response is obtained in both, whole cells  and isolated plasma membranes . thus, the data suggest that nsaids effect is on nadph oxidase system. an estimated ic <dig> near 10− <dig> m was obtained for these aspirin-like drugs  <cit>  . the enzymatic system responsible for h2o <dig> generation in adipocytes has been identified previously as a nox <dig> isoform  <cit> , which can be activated by mn2+ or gtp prior to interaction with hormones  <cit> . besides nox <dig>  no other isoforms have been detected in adipocytes  <cit> . results in isolated membranes of rat adipocytes showed that nox activity was low in the absence of mn2+, but that it was stimulated by all four nsaid . after nox activation by mn2+ or gtpγs , nsaid produced greater stimulation . the response observed with nsaid is similar to the response pattern obtained with insulin-challenged adipocyte plasma membranes , which utilizes h2o <dig> as a second messenger  <cit> .

nsaid-activated nox <dig> impairs bt2camp-stimulated lipolysis
experiments were designed to identify the source of the pool of h2o <dig> impairing bt2camp-activated lipolysis in adipocytes. figure  <dig> shows that the stimulatory action of insulin and nsaid on nox to raise h2o <dig> in isolated plasma membranes was prevented by dpi, a non-specific nox inhibitor  <cit> , by the anti-nox <dig> antibody, and by oxidized cyt c, which traps the electron from the superoxide ion  <cit>  produced by nox, which in turn might dismutate spontaneously to form h2o <dig> in a non-enzymatic reaction. based on the fact that specific aquaporins facilitate h2o <dig> diffusion across membranes  <cit>  and that ag+ ions are potent inhibitors of these transporters  <cit> , agno <dig> was tested to prevent h2o <dig> transport across the plasma cell membrane. indeed, as can be observed in figure  <dig>  agno <dig> did not modify h2o <dig> synthesis by nox. figure  <dig> shows that inhibition of glycerol release by aspirin-like drugs disappeared with the three compounds, impairing h2o <dig> synthesis, as well as with agno <dig> , which allows h2o <dig> generation but interferes with its uptake by aquaporins  <cit> . in all of these experiments, bt2camp-activating glycerol release prevailed over the antilipolytic action of nsaid .

aspirin inhibition of isoproterenol-activated lipolysis
since insulin inhibits adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis  <cit> , the effect of aspirin  on isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in rat adipocytes was studied. as expected, isoproterenol-mediated lipolysis was blunted by both insulin and aspirin . this agrees with previously published results showing that nsaids inhibit adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis in isolated adipocytes  <cit> . because nsaids did not modify the binding of adrenergic agonist to their receptor  <cit> , and inhibited bt2camp-activated lipolysis , it is clear that the antagonistic effect of nsaids on isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis is located downstream the camp production.

discussion
nsaid are the most widely used drugs  <cit> . their canonical molecular action inhibiting cyclooxygenases  has been enlarged by numerous cox-independent actions; among these, we reported an inhibition of camp-mediated pka activation in adipocytes  <cit> . results in this paper supply details on the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, which was obtained with nsaid concentrations within the micromolar range, near or even below the reported levels found in human blood after administration of these compounds for therapeutic purposes  <cit> . however, the goal of this paper was not to study nsaid antidiabetic actions  <cit> , but to gain insights into the molecular bases of insulin-like actions of nsaids on the metabolic regulation in adipose cells. sufficient information hinted at h2o <dig> as the intermediate molecule between aspirin and the inhibition of stimulated lipolysis  <cit> . results in figure  <dig> not only show that bt2camp-stimulated lipolysis was decreased with aspirin, but that this inhibitory action was shared by naproxen, nimesulide, and piroxicam, and, therefore, this action might be considered as a common property of nsaids. results also suggest a physiological role of h2o <dig> in the regulation of stimulated lipolysis, because h2o <dig> disappearance by supplementation with catalase permitted extra synthesis of glycerol at all doses of bt2camp . the proposal that h2o <dig> is produced by nox after its activation with nsaid was inspired by the reported action of insulin on adipocytes  <cit> . indeed, submicromolar concentrations of four selected nsaid raised the h2o <dig> pool, either in isolated adipocytes  or in plasma membranes from adipocytes . products generated by nox activation—o2•– and h2o2—have multiple actions in signaling processes . currently, specific nox inhibitors are not available  <cit> . however, our experiments strongly support that h2o <dig> was generated by the nsaid-activated nox <dig> isoform based on the following pieces of independent direct or indirect evidence: i) nox <dig> is the only nox isoform expressed in adipocytes  <cit> , ii) the enzymatic system responsible for h2o <dig> generation was inhibited with dpi , the classical and most frequently used nox inhibitor  <cit> ; iii) h2o <dig> synthesis blockade and subsequent inhibition of the antilipolytic action of nsaids was observed after the addition of either exogenous catalase or exogenous cyt c , agents that decrease the h2o <dig> concentration resulting from nox catalytic activity  <cit> ; iv) mn2+ and gtpγs-activated h2o <dig> synthesis in the membranes of rat adipocytes , as shown previously for activation of nox in human adipocytes by mn2+ and gtpγs  <cit> ; v) agno <dig> which allows h2o <dig> generation , interferes with its antilipolytic action in whole adipocytes by inhibiting aquaporins , showing that the enzymatic system responsible for h2o <dig> generation  is located in the plasma membrane and releases h2o <dig> outside the cell, and vi) a very diluted solution of nox <dig> antibody impaired h2o <dig> synthesis . this last inhibitory action of nox <dig> antibodies over nadph oxidase activity has been previously reported in both cell-free  <cit>  and intact cells assays  <cit> . thus, although none of the experiments described above by itself provides conclusive evidence of nox <dig> activation by nsaids, to our knowledge there is no enzymatic system, besides nox <dig>  responsible for h2o <dig> generation at the plasma membranes of isolated adipocytes that could explain simultaneously all the results described above.

the association of h2o <dig> with the lipolysis in adipocytes can be supported by abundant experimental evidence. an elevated pool of h2o <dig> in adipocytes—as observed after incubation with insulin  <cit> , added h2o <dig> <cit> , monoamine oxidase substrates  <cit> , and nsaid —resulted in inhibition of stimulated lipolysis. this inhibition of stimulated lipolysis disappeared when the pool of h2o <dig> was lowered with catalase  <cit>  , dpi, anti-nox <dig> antibody, or cyt c . one exception merits special mention. it was shown that elevated production of h2o <dig> in agno3-treated rat adipocytes  was not followed by inhibition of the stimulated lipolysis . these results suggest that the production of h2o <dig> by nox occurs outside the cell and that its subsequent uptake into the cell requires the participation of aqp <dig>  <cit> . these facts are in complete agreement with previous findings by miller et al., who showed that the downstream intracellular effects of h2o <dig> can be regulated across cell membranes  <cit> . our results with catalase  and cyt c  in preventing nsaid-mediated inhibition of lipolysis  support this proposal. it is noteworthy within this context that three different aquaporins, aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  and aqp <dig>  are expressed in adipose tissue and that all of these are upregulated by insulin  <cit> . interestingly, one of these aquaporins  is capable of mediating h2o <dig> uptake  <cit> .

we reported previously that h2o <dig> generated by insulin in adipose cells oxidizes two cys residues in the type ii pka holoenzyme  <cit> . in fact, formation of a disulfide bond between cys- <dig> in the catalytic α subunit and cys- <dig> in the regulatory β subunit produces an inactive holoenzyme resistant to activation by camp, and the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system is responsible for the disulfide bond reduction  <cit> . therefore, with the results obtained in this work it is possible to propose as hypothesis that h2o <dig> generated by nsaids impairs pka catalytic function in the same way as occurs in insulin-treated adipocytes  <cit> .

a recognized action of nsaid on phagocytic cells is the antagonizing effect on the production of reactive oxygen species  during the inflammatory process  <cit> . the effect described here for nsaid, i.e., nox <dig> activation and higher production of h2o <dig>  was observed in a non-phagocytic cell in which h2o <dig> mediates the physiological response to insulin  <cit> ; the significance of this action might be enhanced in such cells because, as shown in this paper, pka is an additional target molecule for h2o <dig>  opposite results have been described for the h2o2-mediated oxidation of other pka types, i.e., whereas oxidation of type i pka in skeletal muscle resulted in its activation  <cit>  and type ii pka oxidation of rat adipocyte and bovine heart holoenzyme resulted in a lack of activation, even in the presence of activators  <cit> . of great significance is the fact described in this paper that nsaid actions include the physiological amplification cascades utilized by hormones. here we described two hormonal second messengers—h2o <dig> and camp—that are associated with nsaid effects.

within a broad context, a synergistic role can be hypothesized for h2o <dig> by the convergence of two sets of facts: on the one hand, the h2o <dig> inhibitory effect on ptpase and other phosphatases as documented by the goldstein group  <cit> , and on the other hand, h2o2-mediated prevention of kinase activation, as shown for pka in this paper and for kinases that might be inactivated by salicylates  <cit> ; when taken together, all of these explain the nsaid effect that enhances insulin action in adipose tissue and the hypoglycemic effect of high doses of salicylates in the treatment of diabetes  <cit> . also, this allows a reassessment of previously described antagonism between epinephrine and nsaid actions in rat hepatocytes  <cit> . furthermore, nox <dig>  aqp <dig>  and type ii pka  possess wide tissue distribution according to microarray expression data found in the gene atlas project  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
nsaids activate nox <dig> in adipocytes to produce h2o <dig>  which impairs camp-dependent pka-ii activation, preventing isoproterenol-activated lipolysis. h2o <dig> production for signaling in adipocytes is a novel cox-independent effect of nsaid, which opens a wide horizon to decipher some of their multiple molecular actions.
