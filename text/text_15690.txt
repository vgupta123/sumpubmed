BACKGROUND
infection with entamoeba histolytica results in  <dig> million to  <dig> million symptomatic cases of amoebiasis worldwide each year, causing  <dig> thousand to  <dig> thousand deaths annually  <cit> . e. histolytica, the pathogenic amoeba, is indistinguishable in its cyst and trophozoite stages from those of non-pathogenic e. dispar  <cit>  and e. moshkovskii  <cit> , except in rare cases of invasive disease when e. histolytica trophozoite may contain ingested red blood cells  <cit> . estimates of intestinal e. histolytica infections have been primarily based on microscopic examination of stools, which has a sensitivity of only 60%, even under optimal standards  <cit> . the microscopic examination of stool alone, however, fails to differentiate e. histolytica from those of morphologically similar non-pathogenic species such as e. dispar and e. moshkovskii. stool culture followed by isoenzyme analysis enables the differentiation of e. histolytica from e. dispar  <cit> . however, this method of culture when followed by isoenzyme analysis requires one to several weeks to obtain the result and also special laboratory facilities, making it impractical for use in the routine diagnosis of intestinal amoebiasis.

various approaches are being followed for specific identification and detection of e. histolytica in stool specimens such as detection of e. histolytica coproantigen in stool samples by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay  and detection of e. histolytica dna in stool samples by polymerase chain reaction . currently few commercial elisa kits are available for detection of e. histolytica/e. dispar coproantigen in stool. these include techlab entamoeba test to detect e. histolytica/e. dispar  <cit> , alexon prospect elisa to detect e. histolytica/e. dispar and giardia lamblia  <cit>  and triage parasite panel to detect antigen of e. histolytica/e. dispar, giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium parvum in stool specimens  <cit> . the main limitation of all these elisa kits is that they can identify the amoebae only as e. histolytica-e. dispar complex but not specifically as e. histolytica, e. dispar or e. moshkovskii. however, a monoclonal antibody based tech lab e. histolytica ii elisa is commercially available for the specific detection of e. histolytica antigen directly in stool specimen  <cit> , but this kit can neither detect e. dispar nor e. moshkovskii in stool specimen.

recently, a nested pcr targeting 16s-like rrna gene has been reported from the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, dhaka, bangladesh   <cit>  as well as from our laboratory at jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research  hospital, puducherry, india  <cit>  to detect and differentiate e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii directly in stool specimens. but the identification of the amoeba in the stool specimens either as e. histolytica, e. dispar or e. moshkovskii was carried out by performing nested pcr each time separately for individual species which was tedious. to overcome this disadvantage, the main objective of the present study was to develop and evaluate a nested multiplex pcr targeting the 16s- like rrna gene for simultaneous detection and differentiation of e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar directly in stool samples.

RESULTS
microscopy and culture of stool
a total of  <dig> out of  <dig>  stool samples screened were positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii by microscopy and/or culture. these included  <dig> specimens positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii by both microscopy and culture,  <dig> positive by microscopy and  <dig> positive by culture . all the  <dig> negative control stool samples were negative for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii by microscopy and culture.

nested multiplex pcr
quantification of dna in stool specimen
the dna yield was found to be approximately  <dig> μg/ml. the purity of dna extract from stool specimen was found to be satisfactory as the value of ratio of readings at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm  was approximately  <dig> .

primer validation
the sequencing result of pcr product of e. dispar, e. histolytica and e. moshkovskii laredo showed 99% to 100% identity to the sequences of e. dispar, e. histolytica and e. moshkovskii laredo, deposited in genbank with accession number ,  and  respectively.

assessment of competition for non-target dna
the assessment of competition of other non-target dna present in stool dna extract with a target dna in nested multiplex pcr showed expected amplification without any non-specific amplification.

estimation of minimum number of entamoeba cells detectable by nested multiplex pcr
the nested multiplex pcr detected e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii dna, even at the minimum parasite concentration tested . the detection limit of nested multiplex pcr for e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii was found to be approximately  <dig> entamoeba protozoa cells, since  <dig>  μl of template dna  gave positive signal .

estimation of nested multiplex pcr to detect mixed infections with e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii species
 <dig> cells of e. dispar and e. moshkovskii species as the background allowed for the detection of a  <dig>  cell of e. histolytica;  <dig> cells of e. histolytica and e. moshkovskii species as the background allowed for the detection of a  <dig>  cell of e. dispar ; and  <dig> cells of e. histolytica and e. dispar species as the background allowed for the detection of a  <dig>  cell of e. moshkovskii .

cross checking the results of nested multiplex pcr
the cross checking of the results of nested multiplex pcr was satisfactory as the same results were reproduced in randomly selected samples showing a mixed infection when subjected to individual species specific pcr in separate tubes.

nested multiplex pcr
the nested multiplex pcr developed and evaluated in the present study showed that the size of diagnostic fragments of pcr products was clearly different for all the three entamoeba species, the species-specific product size for e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively .

the nested multiplex pcr was performed on a total of  <dig> stool specimens including  <dig> stool specimens positive for e. histolytica, e. dispar, or e. moshkovskii by microscopy and/or culture, and  <dig> amoebae-negative control stool specimens. the nested multiplex pcr was positive in  <dig> out of  <dig> stool specimens that were positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii complex trophozoites/cysts by microscopy and/or culture, thus showing a sensitivity of 94%. all the  <dig> negative control stool samples were negative by nested multiplex pcr thus showing a specificity of 100%.

the probability of negative nested multiplex pcr results in  <dig> control stool samples due to pcr inhibitors was ruled out by spiking the dna of negative stool specimens with standard dna of entamoeba followed by nested multiplex pcr amplification.

the nested multiplex pcr detected mono-infection with e. histolytica in  <dig> % , e. dispar in  <dig> %  and e. moshkovskii in  <dig> %  of stool samples. the pcr also detected mixed infections by both e. dispar and e. moshkovskii in  <dig> % , e. dispar and e. histolytica in  <dig> % , and e. histolytica and e. moshkovskii in  <dig> %  of stool samples. the test also detected mixed infections by all the three species  in  <dig> %  of stool samples . the result of the nested multiplex pcr as compared with microscopy and culture is also summarized in table  <dig> 

pcr positivity of e. dispar, e. histolytica and e. moshkovskii among the stool samples that were positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii by microscopy and/or culture is presented in table  <dig> 

techlab e. histolytica ii elisa
the techlab e. histolytica ii elisa test was performed to detect e. histolytica coproantigen in  <dig> randomly selected stool samples that were positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii complex by microscopy and/or culture.

the techlab e. histolytica ii elisa detected coproantigen in  <dig> out of  <dig>  stool specimens positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar/e. moshkovskii complex by microscopy and/or culture. these  <dig> amoebic antigen positive stool specimens included  <dig> specimens positive for e. histolytica as mono-infection,  <dig> specimens positive for e. histolytica and e. dispar as mixed-infection,  <dig> specimen positive for e. histolytica and e. moshkovskii as mixed-infection, and  <dig> specimens positive for all the three species namely e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar as mixed-infection by the nested multiplex pcr .

comparison of results of nested multiplex pcr and techlab e. histolytica ii elisa test performed on  <dig> stool specimens is summarised in the table  <dig> 

discussion
to be able to detect and distinguish e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii in stool samples is extremely important for accurate diagnosis of intestinal amoebiasis and for knowing the true prevalence of pathogenic e. histolytica in the community. various dna based molecular methods have been evaluated for accurate detection of e. histolytica, e. dispar or e. moshkovskii  <cit> .

the present study, describes a new nested multiplex pcr strategy for species-specific detection and differentiation of e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii dna directly in the stool samples of patients.

recently a single round pcr to detect e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii in stool samples has been reported by hamzah et al  <cit> , the study reported that out of  <dig> stool samples positive for entamoeba spp. by microscopy only  <dig> were successfully identified at species level by pcr, which included  <dig> positive for e. histolytica and  <dig> for e. dispar, but no amplification of e. moshkovskii was observed in a thai population  <cit> . in contrast, our study has shown the presence of e. moshkovskii in the indian population. the negative result for e. moshkovskii in thai population may be attributed to the small sample size used in the study. a detailed comparative study between these two newly described pcr techniques may yield useful information especially in the field of molecular-based diagnosis of intestinal amoebiasis.

nested pcr was used in the present study because it increases sensitivity  <cit> . clinical specimens such as stool often contain pcr inhibitors even after purification steps. the two rounds of pcr might have assisted in compensating the effects of inhibitors present in clinical specimens. the first pcr product may be in too low concentration for detection with ethidium bromide stained gels using a uv transilluminator. the detection limit of agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide stain using an uv transilluminator is approximately  <dig> ng of dna  <cit> . the product of first pcr may be just enough to provide adequate templates for the synthesis of second pcr product in the nested reaction to be detected by ethidium bromide staining.

the nested multiplex pcr was negative in  <dig> out of  <dig> stool specimens that were positive for e. histolytica/e. dispar /e. moshkovskii complex trophozoites/cysts by microscopy and/or culture. the negative result due to inhibition of pcr in all these  <dig> stool samples was ruled out by spiking with standard dna of entamoeba followed by nested multiplex pcr amplification.

the negative pcr result in these  <dig> stool samples may be due to the presence of other entamoeba species. however, we feel that this supposition needs to be proven by further development of molecular tools to confirm the presence of other entamoeba species commonly found in humans, such as e. coli, e. hartmanni or other similar looking entamoeba species. till then these negative results may be imputed to the sensitivity limitation of the nested multiplex pcr technique.

in the present study by using nested multiplex pcr it was shown that the rate of mono infection with e. dispar was the highest. e. dispar was demonstrated in  <dig> out of  <dig> stool samples  amongst patients attending jipmer hospital. the study also shows that the rate of co-infection with e. histolytica and e. dispar was the highest  as compared to both, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii , and e. histolytica and e. moshkovskii . the occurrence of co-infection with e. dispar and e. histolytica in the stool specimens has been documented by several studies reported earlier  <cit> .

nested multiplex pcr was positive for e. histolytica dna in  <dig> stool specimens which were negative for coproantigen by techlab elisa. the possible reason for such occult infection  may be due to degradation of lectin antigen in stool specimen due to prolonged storage  at -20°c prior to testing; thus resulting in a negative test for amoebic coproantigen by the elisa.

in the present study the overall correlation between the results of nested multiplex pcr and that of techlab e. histolytica ii elisa to detect e. histolytica in stool specimen was greater than 90%. this agreement between these two techniques shows clearly that either of the techniques may be used alone to yield an accurate assessment of the presence of e. histolytica in a stool specimen, but not for the detection of either e. dispar or e. moshkovskii in stool specimens by techlab e. histolytica ii elisa.

the inability of techlab e. histolytica ii elisa to detect either e. dispar or e. moshkovskii in stool specimens is the noted disadvantage of the test. the nested multiplex pcr, on the other hand appears to be more useful for simultaneous detection of all the three species,e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar when performed directly on the stool specimens. this is the main advantage of this test, and is of importance due to the fact that there is an increasing documentation of both e. moshkovskii and e. dispar from different parts of the world  <cit> , including from puducherry, the southern union territory of india  <cit> . the coexistence of non-pathogenic e. dispar and e. moshkovskii as mixed infection or solely as mono-infection amongst the patients showed an increased possibility of faulty diagnosis when the identification of e. histolytica was based primarily on morphology by microscopic examination of stool. the high pcr positivity of e. moshkovskii among the study population supports the view that humans are a true host for this free-living amoeba  <cit> .

the inability to distinguish e. histolytica from those of morphologically similar e. dispar or e. moshkovskii in the stool samples is the main limitation of microscopy or culture. as shown in the present study only  <dig> % of  <dig> stool specimens positive for e. histolytica, e. dispar or e. moshkovskii complextrophozoites/cysts by either microscopy or culture were actually e. histolytica and the remaining majority of stool specimens were positive for e. dispar and/or e. moshkovskii. in the absence of tests such as the nested multiplex pcr or elisa for specific detection of e. histolytica, the majority of suspected infections would have been wrongly diagnosed as e. histolytica infection and treated unnecessarily with anti-amoebic drugs. we therefore, recommend the use of the nested multiplex pcr for simultaneous detection and accurate identification of all the three entamoeba species in stool specimens.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study reports a new nested multiplex pcr strategy for species specific detection and differentiation of e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii dna in stool specimens. the test is highly specific, sensitive and also rapid; results of the test are available within  <dig> hours of receipt of stool specimens.
