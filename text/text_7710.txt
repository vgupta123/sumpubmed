BACKGROUND
most vesicular stomatitis viruses have broad host ranges, infecting a large number of vertebrate and insect species  <cit> . in the united states, vesicular stomatitis new jersey virus  is one of the causative agents of vesicular stomatitis  in domestic livestock. clinically affected animals typically present with vesicular lesions on the muzzle, tongue, lips, or coronary band, and occasionally the teats  <cit> . vesicles usually rupture within 24- <dig> hr, leaving reddish ulcerations, which begin healing in 6- <dig> d  <cit> . excessive salivation and a loss of appetite can occur when lesions are around the muzzle or in the oral cavity. in experimental settings, virus transmission by various biologically relevant routes including biological  <cit>  and mechanical  <cit>  insect transmission and animal-to-animal contact  <cit>  has been demonstrated.

vesicular stomatitis has been described as sporadically epidemic in the western united states  <cit> , with outbreaks occurring in 1982- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  2004- <dig>  and most recently in  <dig>  horses and cattle are the primary livestock hosts affected during outbreaks, although swine can be affected as well. during the 1982- <dig> vsnjv epidemic, vsnjv infected livestock were confirmed in  <dig> states. of the  <dig> animals confirmed to be infected during this epidemic, 68% were cattle  <cit> . in contrast, during the  <dig> vsnjv epidemic in which clinically affected livestock were identified in six states, 71% of the foreign animal disease investigations and 78% of the positive premises involved horses  <cit> . during the 2004- <dig> vsnjv epidemic, horses accounted for 78% of the  <dig>  animals confirmed to be infected with vsnjv  <cit> . vsnjv infected animals were reported in nine states.

phylogenetic analyses of vsnjv isolates obtained during these epidemics demonstrate that the virus lineage associated with each epidemic is distinct from that associated with a different epidemic   <cit> . when this is examined in conjunction with epidemiologic data collected during outbreaks, it appears that individual vsnjv strains have distinct host predilections. this theory is supported by reports of previous unsuccessful attempts to produce vs in cattle by experimental inoculation with swine and equine vsnjv strains  <cit> , and by a report of decreased virulence of a  <dig> bovine vsnjv strain in experimentally infected pigs  <cit> . if real, such host predilections could have a profound impact on the current understanding of transmission, both animal-to-animal and vector-borne, as well as the overall epidemiology of vsnjv.

laboratory challenge of domestic livestock with homologous and heterologous vsnjv strains transmitted through black fly bite to investigate potential viral predilections has not been thoroughly investigated. here, our objective was to more closely evaluate vsnjv host predilection in cattle experimentally infected with homologous and heterologous vsnjv strains and in swine infected with heterologous vsnjv strains. swine have previously been infected with homologous strains  <cit>  and this was not repeated in the current study. differences in clinical presentation and extent and duration of viral shedding were monitored. contact transmission in cattle was evaluated because this is thought to have been the route responsible for continued livestock infection during the winter of the 1982â€“ <dig> epidemic  <cit> .

RESULTS
host predilection
cattle
clinical disease  was detected when feeding occurred on the lower lip or coronary band for all viruses tested . virus was detected from neck bite site swabs of the nj82azb and nj06wye neck inoculated  animals at  <dig> hr post-infection; vesicular lesions were not present on group  <dig> animals. the highest viral swab titer detected on an animal bitten on the lower lip by black flies infected with nj82azb  was  <dig>  tcid50/ml. the highest maximum swab titer observed from animals infected with either nj82cob or njosf was  <dig>  tcid50/ml. there was no significant difference between viruses with respect to maximum viral titer or duration of shedding, although the estimated mean duration of shedding was 2- <dig> days longer for nj82azb than for any other strain . cattle infected with nj82azb also had the highest mean clinical score, which was significantly greater than that of cattle infected with njosf. the positive control animal in the nj82azb group failed to become infected via scarification of the lip or coronary band, and did not seroconvert against the virus. lameness and behavioral changes were only observed in animals inoculated with nj82cob and nj82azb. steers bitten on the coronary band by black flies infected with nj82azb developed severe secondary lesions that spread from the initial inoculation site on the lateral claw, across the inter-digital space and around the entire circumference of the hoof . these animals would remain lying down unless forced to rise, and when standing would avoid bearing weight on the affected hoof and limp severely when moving. two of the three animals inoculated on the lower lip with this virus developed large secondary lesions on the tongue, which in one case resulted in sloughing of the entire epithelial layer, leaving a raw, reddened surface, which had begun healing by pid  <dig>  steers inoculated on the lower lip with nj82cob similarly developed secondary lesions on the tongue and exhibited obvious care when feeding, although a decrease in feed consumption was not observed. obvious physical discomfort or lameness was not observed for any animals infected with either nj06wye or njosf.

swine
clinical disease was detected in all swine infected on the planum rostrale  for both viruses tested. these animals developed large, vesicular lesions that coalesced to cover the entire planum surface, receiving the maximum clinical scores of  <dig>  extent and duration of viral shedding were similar between the two viral strains . one animal infected on the coronary band with nj82azb developed a vesicle on the coronary band and vsnjv was isolated from both the coronary band and the mouth of this animal. this animal would limp noticeably when moving around in its enclosure. the animal infected on the abdomen did not develop any clinical signs of disease, but seroconversion was detected .

animal-to-animal contact
in the initial contact-transmission experiment , primary animals inoculated by the bite of infected black flies with nj82azb developed lesions on the lip and vsnjv was detected on pid  <dig>  and  <dig>  maximum viral titers from swabs of each of these two animals were  <dig>  tcid50/ml and  <dig>  tcid50/ml, respectively from lip swabs of both animals on pid  <dig>  positive swab samples were not recovered from any of the contact animals for this virus, and all animals remained seronegative throughout the experiment. one primary animal infected with the nj95coe yielded a maximum virus titer of  <dig>  tcid50/ml on pid  <dig>  and positive swab samples were collected on pid  <dig> and  <dig>  virus was not collected from swab samples of the second primary animal. again, no positive vsnjv isolates were detected from any of the contact animals, and all remained seronegative throughout the experiment .

in experiment  <dig>  swab samples were only collected on pids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in experiment  <dig> swab samples were collected daily.

in the second contact experiment, where only nj82azb was examined, peak viral shedding varied among the primary animals . contact animals did not develop clinical signs; however, positive nasal and tonsil swabs were collected on pid  <dig> from one contact animal, and a positive tonsil swab was collected from a second contact animal on pid  <dig>  serology of the first animal indicated seroconversion, to a dilution of 1: <dig>  while the second animal remained seronegative.

discussion
an in depth discussion of vsnjv ecology in livestock populations has been previously described  <cit> . results of the current study and the impacts on vsnjv ecology are included here. the results of the current study, when considered with the results of phylogenetic analysis of vsnjv strains, support the theory of vsnjv host predilection in a cattle model. clinical disease scores were significantly greater in cattle inoculated with nj82azb, njcob, and njwye, than those infected with a swine strain . though clinical scores were not significantly different between cattle infected with vsnjv isolated from an outbreak primarily affecting cattle  and those infected with vsnjv isolated during an outbreak primarily affecting horses  it is important to note that lameness and discomfort was only observed when experimental animals were infected with a homologous virus strain. when compared to previous results  <cit> , clinical severity and shedding patterns of animals infected with nj06wye were more similar to cattle infected by black fly bite with a  <dig> vsnjv strain, which was isolated during an outbreak that primarily affected horses.

animal  <dig> became infected and presented with clinical disease even though a blood meal was not detected in any of the infected black flies used to inoculate this animal. during inoculation, flies were observed biting the coronary band of this animal though, apparently, a blood meal was not taken. this was also seen in a previous study involving pigs, and indicates that probing by infected flies is sufficient for animal infection  <cit> .

the failure of the positive control in the nj82azb trial to become infected following scarification of the lip and coronary band must be addressed. it would be expected that a more virulent strain of virus would cause infection especially since all other positive controls became infected. it is not known why this result was observed, but previous studies have indicated that infection of cattle via the bite of infected black flies is more efficient than scarification  <cit> . this animal was also the smallest of any utilized in the study . disease is usually absent in antibody free cattle less than  <dig> year old as observed during early outbreaks in the united states  <cit> . the size of the control animal may indicate an age less than  <dig> year old and that it is not susceptible to infection.

the results in swine are less conclusive. extent and duration of viral shedding for both nj82azb and nj06wye after exposure to infected black flies was comparable to what has been observed in previous studies of swine infected by the same route with a vsnjv strain isolated during the  <dig> outbreak, which primarily affected horses. previous studies demonstrated similar levels of viral shedding in swine after infection with a swine isolate of vsnjv  <cit> . collectively, these results do not indicate host predilections for vsnjv strains in swine, and are dissimilar to previous results which demonstrated a decreased virulence of nj82azb in swine  <cit> . it must be noted that direct comparisons cannot be made between these studies, since inoculation routes and inoculation doses were different. application of vsnjv to scarified mucosa or by intradermal injection requires much higher doses of virus to achieve consistent infection than in the black fly inoculation model. previous studies have inoculated with approximately 105- <dig> tcid <dig> vsnjv  <cit> . in the current study, saliva collected from infected black flies contained a maximum of  <dig>  plaque forming units/ml. even when considering multiple fly bites, the dose of vsnjv is much lower in the current study, yet extent and duration of virus shedding are comparable or greater. this may indicate that while virus strain does not appear to impact clinical severity, inoculation route might.

the results presented here indicate that infection with different strains of vsnjv result in differences in clinical severity in cattle, but not in swine. the impact of viral strain on clinical severity in other hosts, such as horses, is not known. clinical severity of vsnjv infection is important because detection of vs in us livestock populations largely depends on observation of clinical disease in infected animals. clinical disease in livestock can range from severe to unapparent  <cit> . viral host predilections, which result in variable disease severity, may result in an underestimation of viral prevalence in livestock populations during outbreaks. unapparent or mild clinical cases may be missed, resulting in further spread of the virus during an outbreak. mild or unapparent infections due to viral predilections may contribute to the unequal numbers of investigations and identifications of vsnjv infections in one species over another during epidemics of vsnjv.

severity of clinical disease has added significance because of its potential impact on transmission of the virus, as well as detection in vertebrate hosts. transmission of vsnjv in livestock models has recently been investigated, and multiple routes, consistent with vector-borne, mechanical, and contact transmission have been validated  <cit> . most routes of vsnjv transmission utilize vesicular fluid or infected saliva of the vertebrate host as the source of inoculum, because viremia is not present in infected livestock  <cit> .

with clinical vertebrate hosts serving as a primary source of virus for transmission of vsnjv, clinical severity and extent and duration of viral shedding should be considered when examining the epidemiology of the virus. animal-to-animal contact transmission, as well as virus acquisition by insect vectors, relies upon the amount of virus present. it was previously demonstrated that consistent infection via scarification, which mimics contact transmission or infection via contaminated feed or equipment, requires a dose of 106- <dig> tcid <dig> of virus  <cit> . although it has not been examined, it is expected that the efficiency of vsnjv transmission to potential vectors feeding on or near vesicular lesions would increase along with viral concentration. increases in duration of viral shedding would allow for increased duration of contact among infected and naive animals, as well as a larger time window for vectors to acquire virus from an infected host.

CONCLUSIONS
during an outbreak, host predilection of vsnjv strains could result in more severe clinical disease in one host, over another. in populations of hosts with severe clinical signs, higher rates of detection and virus transmission would be expected. in populations of livestock where clinical signs are unapparent or mild, virus transmission rates may be lower, yet detection could be lower as well, allowing undetected virus spread to occur. in the contact transmission experiments, animal-to-animal contact transmission was observed with nj82azb, but not with nj95coe. virus titers for animals infected with nj82azb were at least one log <dig> higher and present through pid  <dig>  whereas those infected with nj95coe did not yield positive swab samples after pid  <dig>  peak titers were observed at pid  <dig> and  <dig> for nj82azb animals and on pid  <dig> for nj95coe animals, suggesting that virus was present at higher concentrations and for a longer period from animals infected with the nj82azb. although contact transmission in cattle was not observed with experimental animals infected with a heterologous vsnjv strain, it cannot be concluded that contact transmission of this virus would not occur among cattle in a natural setting. it is likely that after introduction of a heterologous strain of vsnjv into a population, contact transmission would occur when population densities are high, but at a lower rate than if infected with a homologous strain.

further work is needed to examine vsnjv strain host predilections in additional hosts. experimental verification of the trends observed in the current study in other livestock hosts, such as horses, would add to the understanding of vsnjv epidemiology. additionally, fine scale genetic analysis of isolates obtained during outbreaks may provide additional information that may be used to identify virulence factors associated with vsnjv. this information could further illuminate the ecology of vsnjv during epidemics in livestock. monitoring and control efforts during epidemics could be modified to better track and isolate vsnjv in livestock populations.
