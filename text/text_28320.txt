BACKGROUND
self-incompatibility  is a widely distributed mechanism to prevent self-fertilization in flowering plants 
 <cit> . classic genetic studies revealed two major classes of homomorphic si, gametophytic  and sporophytic  systems 
 <cit> . recent studies have focused on identifying molecules that mediate si events. in solanaceae, rosaceae and plantaginaceae gsi species, the stylar inhibition of incompatible pollen is mediated through an interaction between a stylar s-rnase  and the pollen tube-borne f-box protein, slf 
 <cit> . gsi in poppies  is mediated by a calcium-based signaling pathway that is most likely triggered by an interaction between a stigma-expressed s-glycoprotein ligand  and its cognate plasma membrane receptor, which is a pollen-expressed ca2+-channeled protein 
 <cit> . ssi in brassicaceae is regulated by an s-haplotype-specific protein interaction between a stigma-specific s-receptor kinase  and its cognate ligand s-locus cysteine-rich  
 <cit> .

poaceae exhibit a gsi system controlled by at least two independent and multiallelic loci  
 <cit> . an incompatibility reaction occurs when both the s and z alleles of the haploid pollen are matched in the pistil. the mechanisms of the grass gsi are poorly understood relative to the well-characterized single-locus gsi system mentioned above. numerous efforts to identify the genes of the s and z loci have been performed, but currently, the genes for s or z on either the pollen or pistil side remain unknown 
 <cit> .

li et al. 
 <cit>  reported the putative pollen s-gene bm <dig> identified from phalaris coerulescens, which is a grass si species. this gene was originally observed to co-segregate with the s genotype. later studies indicated that bm <dig> encodes a functional thioredoxin protein, which is possibly involved in post-translational protein modification and is located at ca. 1 cm from the s-locus 
 <cit> . hackauf and wehling 
 <cit>  identified a putative ubiquitin-specific protease  gene with a pistil-specific expression pattern and co-segregation with the z-locus, thus suggesting the potential involvement of protein ubiquitination in the grass si system. however, whether the ubp gene is a component of the z-locus or a linked gene with suppression recombination around the z locus is unknown 
 <cit> . kakeda 
 <cit>  isolated two f-box genes in hordeum bulbosum based on the partial clone has <dig>  which is an anther-derived marker showing complete linkage to the s locus. yang et al. 
 <cit>  constructed subtractive hybridization cdna libraries to enrich the si expressed genes in lolium perenne.

there are certain physiological characteristics of grass si that resemble features of the papaver system and brassica ssi including the dry stigma type and a rapid response to stigma-pollen interactions 
 <cit> . in these three si systems, the stigmas critically discriminate between compatible and incompatible pollen grains and promote compatible pollen growth while preventing incompatible pollen adhesion, hydration, germination or invasion. to fulfill these unique functions, stigmas should express genes that encode the proteins required for appropriate development of and accomplishment in pollen-stigma interactions. it is likely that many of these genes are stigma-specific or preferential. to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of stigma development and pollen-stigma interactions, it is important to generate a near-complete catalog of genes expressed specifically or preferentially in stigma cells.

currently, genome-wide transcriptome analyses of wet, dry and semidry stigmas have been conducted on tobacco 
 <cit> , arabidopsis 
 <cit> , rice 
 <cit> , maize 
 <cit>  and senecio squalidus <cit> . however, stigma transcriptome data sets are not available in si species of the poaceae, the fourth largest family of flowering plants, which includes all cereal crops and major cultivated forage crops 
 <cit> . to develop insight into the conserved and diverse aspects of stigma development and functions across multiple species, it is useful to expand the available transcriptomic resources for incompatible species to allow comparative analysis.

leymus chinensis  tzvel. , a member of the tribe triticeae, is a key dominant species of typical grassland communities in the eurasian steppe region with economic and ecological value. the species is one of most important forage crops for grazing animals in china and is important in environmental protection, including soil and water conservation 
 <cit> . l. chinensis is a gsi species with incompatibility responses occurring on the stigma surface before or immediately after pollen germination 
 <cit> .

the aims of the present study were to search for genes expressed specifically or preferentially in the stigma of the incompatible grass plant at the entire genome level using high-throughput next generation sequencing technology to perform an rna-seq analysis on the stigmas, leaves and ovaries of l. chinensis. here, the gene expression profiling of various tissues identified  <dig>  genes that were predicted to be specifically or preferentially expressed in the stigma. the stigma gene sets were significantly enriched in cell-cell communication and signal transduction mechanisms, intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport. our results also indicated that the sheepgrass stigmas shared common si candidate genes, such as kinase genes, identified in lolium. to our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale survey of gene expression in the stigmas of an si grass species. the availability of a pool of stigma-specific or preferential genes for l. chinensis offers an opportunity to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of pollen-stigma interactions and si in poaceae.

RESULTS
the identification of stigma-specific or preferential genes
to identify the genes involved in stigma development and required for unique stigma functions, we performed an rna-seq analysis on the stigmas, leaves and ovaries of leymus chinensis. these three samples enabled us to distinguish stigma-specific transcripts from transcripts that contribute to common cellular activities and functions. mature stigmas, which were unpollinated and reached the largest expansion, were collected from the pistils just before anther dehiscence to avoid contamination with pollen grains . the stigmas were excised by cutting the pistil just below the base of the plumose stigma, and the remainder of the pistil was used as an ovary sample. approximately  <dig>  stigmas,  <dig>  ovaries and  <dig> leaves of 10-day old seedlings were collected for each rna preparation. the mrna from the three tissues was used to construct cdna libraries, which were then sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> system. paired-end 100-bp sequence reads were then generated. after quality control,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads were obtained from the stigmas, ovaries and leaves libraries, respectively.figure  <dig>

in previous studies, we performed long-read transcriptome sequencing of several cdna libraries from different tissues of sheepgrass, including flowers before and after pollination and leaves, using a roche  <dig> gs flx sequencer 
 <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were obtained, including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the mean contig size was 607 bp. to identify the genes that corresponded to the sequencing reads in each library of the present study, the purity-filtered high-quality reads were mapped against the reference transcriptome dataset, which was generated using roche  <dig> pyrosequencing technology. altogether,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs were detected at the stigmas, ovaries and leaves, respectively . the stigma contigs, ovary contigs and leaf contigs represent about  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total contigs of the roche  <dig> sequencing dataset, respectively. of these unigenes,  <dig>  were common to all three tissues . a substantial number of genes showed tissue-specific expression:  <dig> in the stigma,  <dig> in the ovary, and  <dig>  in the leaves.figure  <dig>

using a fold change of > <dig>  false discovery rate  of <1e- <dig> as a cutoff to identify differentially expressed genes,  <dig> contigs were up-regulated in the stigma compared to the ovary and leaf . these contigs were considered to be preferentially expressed in the sheepgrass stigma. thus,  <dig>   contigs were specifically or preferentially expressed in the stigma  .

confirmation of stigma-specific or preferential genes by real time pcr analysis
to validate the expression of the genes detected by the rna-seq analysis,  <dig> genes with different expression patterns in the stigmas and leaves were selected for real-time pcr analysis . scatterplots were generated by comparing the log <dig> fold change determined by the transcriptome analysis and real time pcr. the correlation between these two analyses was then evaluated. the results showed that the expression patterns of these genes examined by real time pcr were well correlated with those by rna-seq , thus supporting the reliability of our rna-seq data .figure  <dig>

kog annotation of the stigma-specific or preferential genes
from the  <dig>  contigs specifically or preferentially expressed in the stigma,  <dig> contigs had putative functions and  <dig> contigs were assigned as hypothetical proteins  based on blastx similarity searches against the swiss-prot and ncbi non-redundant protein sequences  databases. the  <dig> contigs were further annotated and classified based on eukaryotic orthologous groups  categories. altogether,  <dig> contigs were assigned kog functional annotations  and grouped into  <dig> functional categories . among the kog categories, “signal transduction mechanisms”  was the most abundant .figure  <dig>

gene ontology  annotation
gene ontology  assignment programs were utilized for the functional categorization of annotated unigenes of the sheepgrass stigma dataset. in many cases, multiple terms were assigned to the shared contig. a total of  <dig> contigs were categorized into  <dig> main functional groups belonging to  <dig> categories . the go terms of their subcategories are presented in figure

a comparison of the go classification of stigma-specific or preferential genes in sheepgrass, rice and arabidopsis
the stigma-specific or preferential expressed gene datasets of rice 
 <cit>  and arabidopsis 
 <cit> , two compatible species, are available to provide the opportunity to compare the diversity and conservation of stigma-specific or preferential genes in species of mono- and dicotyledons. a total of  <dig> unigenes of rice stigmas and  <dig> of arabidopsis stigmas were categorized into functional groups using the go assignments. the wego online tool 
 <cit>  was used to classify the go functions for all genes of the sheepgrass, rice and arabidopsis stigma-specific or preferential datasets to understand the distribution of gene functions at the macro level. the comparative analysis showed that these three stigma transcriptomes shared broad similarities in the proportion of genes in the three main categories and many subcategories . however, differences were also detected among the three species. the high proportions of genes involved in the go terms “protein tag”, “translation regulators”, “cell killing”, and “rhythmic process” were only represented in the sheepgrass stigma dataset. the genes of the go term “symplast” were only observed in arabidopsis. these results suggest that despite the differences in the relationship and gross stigma morphology among these three diverse species, certain conserved mechanisms of structural development and the pollen-stigma interaction process appear to be common. conserved stigma-specific genes may be evidence of the convergent evolution of classes of genes to acquire stigma-specific functions in diverse angiosperm species. unique genes in the sheepgrass stigma dataset may imply intrinsic differences in stigma development and the pollination process between compatible and incompatible species.

go enrichment analysis
a singular enrichment analysis  
 <cit>  was performed to identify the significantly enriched go terms in genes specifically or preferentially expressed in sheepgrass stigma. the results showed that  <dig> go terms were overrepresented in the stigma based on a p-value <  <dig>  and the fdr ≤  <dig>  cutoffs, which were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the cellular components, biological processes, molecular functions categories, respectively. the detailed results of the go enrichment analysis are presented in table

putative transcription factors in the sheepgrass stigma dataset
understanding transcription factors  patterns of expression is of particular interest because the expression and activity of these regulatory proteins is crucial for controlling the expression of numerous genes, and thus, their ability to regulate biological pathways and developmental processes. we searched the tfs in the sheepgrass stigma dataset using a blastx search against the plntfdb   . we identified  <dig> putative tf unigenes from the sheepgrass stigma dataset. these unigenes were clustered into  <dig> tf families. the top  <dig> tf families in the sheepgrass stigma dataset are shown in figure

sheepgrass stigmas share certain potential si candidate genes identified in other grasses
yang et al. 
 <cit>  identified  <dig> expressed si candidate genes for the s and z loci in l. perenne from the si cdna libraries. we compared gene sequences from lolium with the sheepgrass unigene set to reveal the conservation of stigma preferential genes among different si grass stigmas. the nucleotide sequences of  <dig> lolium si candidate genes  were extracted from genbank and blasted against the sheepgrass dataset containing  <dig>  unigenes. significantly similar sequences  were identified for all  <dig> lolium si candidate genes. nine of the ten best hits were included in the sheepgrass stigma dataset and four  were included in the  <dig>  specific or preferential unigenes dataset . an rt-pcr analysis confirmed the stigma-preferential expression for these four contigs . the lolium si candidate genes that had the best hits in the sheepgrass stigma gene dataset included all three predicted kinase genes and a kinase-partner gene of the  <dig> si candidate genes, i.e., can <dig> , can <dig> , can <dig> , and can <dig> . two  of the three predicted kinase genes and the kinase-partner gene showed significant similarities to the unigenes of the specific and preferential sheepgrass stigma gene set, thus indicating a potential role for kinase activity and conserved functional mechanisms in the grass si response.table  <dig>

it was proposed that bm <dig> identified from p. coerulescens was involved in the si response through the post-translational modification of other proteins by thioredoxin proteins 
 <cit> . to detect whether the bm <dig> gene was expressed in sheepgrass, we blasted the gene sequence of bm <dig>  against the sheepgrass unigene set. the result indicated that bm <dig> matched three unigenes  with significantly similar sequences . the rt-pcr experiments validated that contig <dig> was expressed in mature sheepgrass stigmas, thus suggesting that the bm <dig> gene plays an important role in the si process.

discussion
the present studies have identified  <dig>  genes predicted to be specifically or preferentially expressed in the stigmas of sheepgrass using high-throughput next generation sequencing technology to perform an rna-seq analysis. this is a minimium estimate because of stringent filtering process we used in analyzing hiseq  <dig> sequencing data, incomplete detection of the expressed genes based on roche  <dig> sequencing, decrease in the number of identifed genes mapped against the roche  <dig> reference dataset compared to those of actually expressed genes in each tissue. it is likely that at least some of the specific or preferential sheepgrass stigma genes identified in this study function in development of the stigma papillary cells and pollen-stigma interactions. our analysis of the stigma transcriptome demonstrates the unique features of the stigma transcriptional profile. the functional specialization of the stigma for extracellular interactions is reflected by an increased number of stigma-specific or preferential expressed genes involved in signal transduction, such as kinases, receptor-like kinases and calcineurin b-like proteins , the manufacturing of enzymes that most likely facilitate the entry of the pollen tube into the stigma, transcription factors that are possibly implicated in the pollination process, and defense-related genes that function in the defense against pathogens or potentially in response to pollination. it is hypothesized that some of these genes are potentially involved in the pollination response and si mechanisms.

cell-cell communication and signal transduction
genes predicted to function in cell-cell communication and signal transduction are particularly notable in the context of pollen-stigma interactions and si. the sheepgrass stigma dataset contained a significant proportion of genes consistent with the primary recognition role of the stigma in discriminating genotypes of pollen grains. the most noteworthy are genes encoding various putative protein kinases, including probable receptor-like protein kinases , mitogen-activated protein kinases , serine/threonine-protein kinase, cbl-interacting protein kinases, and calcium-dependent protein kinase.

a stigma-specific receptor kinase, srk, which was most extensively studied in brassicaceae, interacts with the ligand  held on the pollen coat and initiates a signal transduction cascade that inhibits the growth of self-pollen and the pollen tube 
 <cit> . in the papaver gsi mechanism, the female s-determinant  is a small stigma-secreted signal peptideand acts as a signaling ligand. the male s-determinant  has a small predicted extracellular domain that has been shown to be involved in both binding to prss and mediating si 
 <cit> . a model for the operation of si in papaver has proposed that prss acts as a signaling ligand that interacts with prps. the sheepgrass stigma dataset contained  <dig> contigs, i.e., contig <dig>  contig <dig>  and contig <dig>  which are predicted to encode probable receptor-like protein kinase at2g <dig>  a probable lrr receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase at1g <dig>  and somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  <dig>  respectively. a homologous gene encoding receptor-like protein kinase at1g <dig> was also identified in the senecio squalidus ssi stigma preferential gene dataset. the contig <dig>  contig <dig> and contig24154-encoded proteins may have a potentially important role in cell-cell communication and signal transduction in the context of pollen-stigma interactions and are therefore notable candidates for further studies of sheepgrass stigma si mechanisms.

mapks are key contributors in signal transduction mechanisms and regulate important cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and death in eukaryotes 
 <cit> . in addition, mapks are known to be involved in the activation of plant defense responses and result in programmed cell death  and pathogen resistance 
 <cit> . a mapk, p <dig>  is responsible for mediating si induced pcd in papaver <cit> . p <dig> is involved in the loss of pollen viability, stimulation of caspase  <dig> like  activity and later dna fragmentation in incompatible pollen 
 <cit> . we also identified two contigs, contig <dig> and contig <dig>  in the sheepgrass stigma dataset that are predicted to encode for mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> and mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  respectively. the presence of mapks in the sheepgrass stigma gene dataset implies that they are likely involved in the early steps of pollination and si responses.

temporal and spatial changes in cytosolic ca2+ concentrations generate specific ca2+ signals, which are decoded by ca2+ sensors 
 <cit> . as a class of calcium-sensing proteins, calcineurin b-like proteins  specifically target a group of sucrose non-fermenting-related serine/threonine kinases , named cbl-interacting protein kinases , to mediate the sensed calcium signal 
. the cbl-cipk system is involved in a wide range of signaling pathways, including abiotic stress responses to drought and salt, innate immunity, plant hormone responses and k+ channel regulation 
 <cit> . no cbls or cipks have been implicated as signaling components in plant si mechanisms. it is particularly notable that four contigs encoding cbl were observed in the analysis of the sheepgrass stigma dataset. these novel genes were not previously identified as pistil-specific or preferential in other species. it was previously mentioned that the can <dig>  gene, which putatively interacts with cbl, was identified in l. perenne stigma 
 <cit> . these results provide new insights into the function of cbl during pollen-pistil interactions in plants and suggest that cbls are potentially involved in si mechanisms.

in addition, the sheepgrass stigma dataset also contained many notable unigenes that encode calcium-related proteins, such as calmodulin-like proteins, probable calcium-binding proteins , and calcium-dependent protein kinases. the role of cytosolic free ca2+ in the regulation of pollen tube growth has been well characterized 
 <cit> . it has been shown that calcium signaling is involved in the self-incompatibility response of papaver and brassica <cit> . in analogy to papaver and brassica si, there is some evidence for the involvement of ca2+-mediated signaling in grass si. the application of ca2+ antagonists to isolated stigmas resulted in the inhibition or delay of the si response on self-pollination in s. cereale and l. perenne <cit> . it is tempting to hypothesize that stigma s and z determinants act as signal molecules in grass by interacting with the “self” pollen s and z partners at the tube plasma membrane, thus inducing a ca2+-mediated signal cascade that results in pollen tube inhibition. however, whether a ca2+-mediated signaling cascade is involved in grass si is unknown.

many recent studies have also implicated ros/h2o <dig> as signaling molecules involved in plant reproductive processes such as pollen tube growth 
 and pollen–stigma interactions 
 <cit> . because peroxidases can generate and consume h2o <dig> <cit> , they should be considered as potentially important components of signal transduction pathways. senecio squalidus stigmas accumulate high amounts of ros, particularly h2o <dig>  in their epidermal cells . the first plant peroxidase gene, ssp , expressed specifically in stigma papillae was identified in s. squalidus <cit> . in the sheepgrass stigma dataset, we detected two contigs that encode peroxidase. the potential signaling role of these interesting genes deserves further investigation.

enzymes most likely facilitating entry of the pollen tube into the stigma
in flowering plants with dry stigmas, the stigmatic surface is covered by a continuous layer of cuticle, which is a significant barrier to pollen tube entry 
 <cit> . for successful pollination and subsequent fertilization, this barrier must be breached by cutinases from the pollen grain surface and stigma pellicle 
 <cit> .

cutinase is an esterase that degrades cutin 
. active cutinases have been detected in the pollen of brassica <cit>  and tropaeolum <cit> , in which they predominantly localize to the intine region of the pollen wall. knox et al. 
 <cit>  has suggested that esterases from the pollen and stigmatic pellicle combine to form an “active cutinase complex” which degrades the cuticle in the region of penetration. although cutinases have been implicated in the process of pollen tube penetration in many species with dry stigmas, none have been fully characterized at the molecular level 
 <cit> . the identification of the genes that encode plant cutinases is important for elucidating the digestion mechanism of the stigmatic cuticle during pollen–stigma interactions. the sheepgrass stigma dataset contains three contigs that were predicted to encode gdsl esterase, two contigs for probable pectin esterase, and four contigs for pectin esterase inhibitor. these unigenes are very interesting candidates for further studies on enzymatic degradation of the stigmatic cuticle during pollination.

when the cuticle has been breached, pollen tubes invade the stigmatic papillary cell wall by growing between its outer and inner layers. the pollen tube then continues to grow through the intercellular spaces  of the transmitting tissue towards the ovary 
 <cit> . much evidence has indicated that pollen- and stigma-derived enzymes and proteins most likely facilitate the entry of the pollen tube into the stigma by loosening the papillary cell wall and the ecm and/or modifying the growing pollen tube wall. these enzymes and proteins included expansins 
 <cit> , pectin esterases 
 <cit> , polygalacturonases 
 <cit> , glucanases 
 <cit> , xylanases 
 <cit> , pectate lyases, pectin methylesterases 
 <cit> , and peroxidases 
 <cit> . lipid transfer proteins , one of the most abundant proteins present in the stigma of several species, have cell wall-loosening activity that is similar to expansion, despite its assumed role in lipid metabolism.

the sheepgrass stigma dataset contained many unigenes for putative cell wall-localized proteins that might function in regulating the expansion or loosening of the stigmatic papillary cell wall and ecm, thus regulating the entry of the pollen tube into the stigma. among these proteins are two expansins, five pectinesterase, a pectin esterase inhibitor, two peroxidases, five polygalacturonases, three pectate lyases, and seven lipid transfer proteins. because their better studied relatives exhibit cell wall-loosening activity and have been implicated in ecm remodeling and the disassembly of ecm structural components, some of these proteins  may facilitate the penetration of the pollen tube into the stigma by modifying the papillary cell wall and ecm.

expansins are cell wall-loosening proteins that regulate cell wall expansion and cell enlargement in a ph-dependent manner 
 <cit> . the expansin superfamily  comprises four distinct families: expansin a , expansin b , expansin-like a  and expansin-like b  
 <cit> . experimental evidence has indicated that expa and expb proteins function in the loosening and extension of cell walls, whereas the exact functions of exla and exlb remain unknown 
 <cit> . the sheepgrass stigma dataset contained a and b expansins. the latter have been suggested to act as cell wall-loosening agents to facilitate pollen adhesion and pistil penetration 
 <cit> . yang et al. 
 <cit>  also identified a prominent si candidate, can <dig>  representing a putative expb protein in l. perenne stigmas. because the assumed functions of expansins have been implicated in the process of pollen tube penetration, it is possible that the expansins expressed preferentially in sheepgrass stigmas might be related to pollen-stigma interactions and si.

transcription factors possibly implicated in the pollination process
the processes underlying pollen recognition and pollen tube growth require the concerted action of genes that are regulated by transcription factors 
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> unigenes encoding the transcription factors of  <dig> families were identified in mature sheepgrass stigmas. most tfs  belonged to seven families: myb, c2h <dig>  c3h, far <dig>  mads, ap2-erebp, and hb. among these families, the myb genes form the largest category. most plant myb genes encode proteins of the r2r3-myb class 
 <cit> . numerous r2r3-myb proteins are involved in the control of plant-specific processes including: primary and secondary metabolism, cell fate and identity, developmental processes, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses 
 <cit> . for example, several r2r3-myb proteins encoded by atmyb0/gl <dig>  atmyb <dig> and atmyb66/wer are involved in the determination of epidermal cell type. atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> control trichome initiation in shoots, whereas atmyb <dig> controls root hair patterning 
 <cit> . two closely related r2r3-mybs, atmyb <dig> and atmyb124/flp regulate stomatal differentiation and patterning. atmyb <dig> regulates synergid cell differentiation during female gametophyte development, pollen tube guidance and the formation of the filiform apparatus 
 <cit> . can <dig>  which is an important si candidate gene that represents a putative myb-like protein, was identified in l. perenne stigmas 
 <cit> . myb transcription factors were also detected in the stigmas of many other species, such as arabidopsis 
 <cit> , rice 
 <cit> , tobacco 
 <cit> , maize 
 <cit> , and crocus 
 <cit> . similar to our studies, the transcriptome analysis of mature maize stigmas also indicated that the myb genes represented the largest category of transcription factors. the preferential expression of myb family genes in the mature or pollinated stigma of many species implicates its possible role in the pollination process and pollen-stigma interactions. recently, gómez-gómez et al. 
 <cit>  isolated csmyb <dig>  which is a transcription factor belonging to the r2r <dig> family gene, from crocus sativus. csmyb <dig> is highly expressed in stigma tissues and poorly expressed in tepals, whereas no transcript was detected in either anthers or leaves. csmyb1’s expression is developmentally regulated with no transcript detected in early stage stigmas but high levels occurring in later stages. it was assumed that csmyb <dig> is possibly involved in the control of stigma morphological development. although myb genes have been identified and isolated in the stigma of many species, the precise functions of these ubiquitous stigma tfs in the pollination process are uncharacterized.

defense-related genes
the stigmas of flowering plants are stubbornly resistant to pathogen invasion. both wet and dry stigmas possess an effective pathogen defense system 
 <cit>  and express a wide range of pathogenesis-related genes that presumably contribute to this stigmatic defense system 
 <cit> . these defense-related genes might function not only in defense against pathogens, but also in response to pollination. the mechanisms originally evolved in defense against pathogens may have been recruited to identify and reject self-pollen in an si response 
 <cit> . the evidence indicated many striking similarities in the process of epidermal cell penetration by fungal spores and the pollen tube, including parallels in cell wall modification, the presence of phenolic derivatives, the accumulation of high levels of extracellular calcium, and the synthesis of β1- <dig> glucan callose 
 <cit> .

our transcriptome analyses have identified several stigma-specific or preferential genes that encode proteins potentially involved in defense responses, such as dihydroflavonol-4-reductase  and bax inhibitor  <dig> . dfr are key regulatory enzymes of flavonoid biosynthesis 
 <cit> . flavonoids are ubiquitous plant secondary metabolites and are accumulated in different organs and tissues of plants 
 <cit> . flavonoids are mainly involved in protecting plants against predation and pathogens  
 <cit> . high amounts of stigmatic flavonoids may be toxic to potential pathogens but are not toxic to pollen. it can be speculated that an unknown signaling mechanism identifies a pollen grain as a pollen grain and not a fungal spore or bacteria.

plant cells can respond to various stimuli, including fungal toxins and biotic and abiotic stresses, by initiating programmed cell death. bax inhibitor  <dig> proteins act as negative regulators of stress-related programmed cell death in plants and animals 
 <cit> . the stable overexpression of this cell death inhibitor in barley reduces susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus fusarium graminearum <cit> . the transient or stable overexpression of bi- <dig> strongly supports the penetration of blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei into barley epidermal cells 
 <cit> . here, we present the first report that genes encoding bi- <dig> proteins were expressed in the stigma of flowering plants. however, further analysis is necessary to better understand the involvement of these notable proteins in pathogen defense and pollen-stigma interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, we present a large-scale investigation of gene expression in the stigmas of sheepgrass , a poaceae gsi species, using a high-throughput rna-seq analysis. altogether,  <dig>  contigs were detected in the stigmas. of these contigs,  <dig>  showed specific or preferential expression. quantitative real-time pcr confirmed the expression patterns of the genes examined by rna-seq. this large-scale survey represents an efficient approach to identify the genes involved in the stigma pollination process. the functional specialization of the stigma for pollination behavior is reflected by unique features of its transcriptional profile. many identified stigma-specific or preferential genes were potentially involved in encoding signaling molecules, such as protein kinases and receptor-like kinases, proteins and enzymes modifying the cell wall, cuticle or ecm to facilitate the entry of the pollen tube into the stigma, and defense-related proteins that function to defend against pathogens or in response to pollination. most of the genes identified by the rna-seq analysis were not previously studied or reported to be expressed in stigmas, and their potential involvement in stigma development and pollen-stigma interactions opens new avenues to better understand the grass gsi system in terms of function and evolution. the future functional characterization of these genes promises to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie incompatible pollen-stigma interactions in grass gsi systems.
