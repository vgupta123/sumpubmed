BACKGROUND
the hematopoietic growth factor erythropoietin  increases erythrocyte numbers by preventing apoptosis of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. recombinant human epo  is a clinically widely used drug, approved for the treatment of anemia worldwide. the surprising clinical observation that rhepo improves cognitive function has always been attributed to the increase in hemoglobin levels and thus enhanced tissue oxygenation . even after the discovery of epo and epo receptor  in the brain  <cit> , it took years until direct epo effects on the central nervous system were first explored by in vivo experiments  <cit> . in the following, epo turned out to have potent antiapoptotic, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in the brain . downstream signaling pathways of epo in cells of the nervous system were extensively explored, showing an involvement of signal transducers and activators of transcription , phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase /akt, ras/extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase , nuclear factor kappa b  and calcium  <cit> . a large number of preclinical studies followed, devoted to the employment of epo as a neuroprotective agent . recent clinical trials on patients with schizophrenia  <cit>  or chronic progressive multiple sclerosis  <cit>  as well as a trial involving extremely preterm infants  <cit> , which all demonstrated improved cognitive outcome upon epo treatment, strongly suggested that this growth factor should be considered as a candidate neuroprotective drug counteracting cognitive decline. nevertheless, the relevant mechanisms of action remained unclear and difficult to formally separate from blood oxygenation effects.

as compared to neuroprotection studies in disease models , work on the function of the epo system in normal brain is scarce. based on the prominent effects of epo on cognition, we hypothesized that an important physiological role of epo in postnatal life or adulthood might be the modulation of neuroplasticity and of higher cognitive functions. we showed previously that in healthy young mice high-dose epo treatment over three weeks enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation  and memory  <cit> , as well as executive and attentional functions  <cit> . a recent functional magnetic resonance imaging  study on healthy volunteers reported enhancement of the hippocampal response during memory retrieval after only one high dose of epo  <cit> . in all of these cases, epo was applied peripherally, penetrated an intact blood-brain-barrier  <cit> , and likely bound to all major classes of brain cells expressing epor, making it impossible to delineate the cell type responsible for enhanced cognition.

to explore whether active epor in cortical neurons has a direct impact on cognitive functions in the non-injured brain, we chose a transgenic strategy. to be independent of rhepo and to genetically define the neuronal target cells, we expressed a constitutively active form, eporr129c in the postnatal mouse forebrain, using a transgene driven by the α-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii  promoter. the substitution in eporr129c  confers growth factor-independent survival and tumorigenicity to hematopoietic ba/f <dig> cells that are normally dependent on interleukin- <dig> for growth and survival  <cit> . the constitutive activity results from the formation of a disulfide-linked receptor homodimer, mimicking the epo-bound form  <cit> . expression of cepor thus activates epor signaling without requirement of a ligand  <cit> .

we show here that cepor expression in pyramidal neurons of cortex and hippocampus of transgenic  mice prominently enhances higher cognitive performance. superior cognition is correlated with enhanced paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation at the schaffer collateral ca <dig> synapse, indicative of increased short- and long-term plasticity. cognitive augmentation in this genetic model is different from that observed in mice receiving rhepo injections and comes at the price of higher impulsivity and reduced behavioral control under strong cognitive challenge. we conclude that active epor stimulates neuronal plasticity independent of any hematopoietic effects and in addition to its neuroprotective properties.

RESULTS
transgenic cepor expression in cortical and hippocampal neurons
to systematically investigate the role of the epo system in learning, memory and attention, we generated a tg mouse line expressing a constitutively active form of epor  under control of the α-camkii promoter , which restricts expression of cepor to forebrain pyramidal neurons of postnatal mice. a hemagglutinin  tag at the amino terminus of cepor allowed monitoring of transgene expression. of three independent lines produced, we analyzed two  in detail, which showed a similar spatio-temporal expression pattern of the mutant receptor . in fact, cepor expression was enriched in cortex and hippocampus  but not in cerebellum and peripheral tissues . western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a  <dig> kda mutant receptor in the brains of tg animals that was regulated developmentally over time and augmented in early postnatal days . mice lacked any signs of neuropathology, were long-lived, and reproduced well. animals in both lines showed normal growth and development, body weight, mating behavior and gross brain morphology, virtually identical to that of wt mice . moreover, hematocrit levels were comparable between wt and tg mice . thus, behavioral differences would not be secondary to developmental changes of the brain or hyperoxygenation.

slight hyperactivity but normal basic behavior of cepor tg mice
we first assessed basic behavioral functions, such as locomotor and exploratory activity, anxiety, and motor performance, in cepor tg mice in comparison to wt littermates. in the elevated plus maze, there was the expected significant effect of arms  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ), but neither a genotype  nor an interaction effect , indicating comparable anxiety levels between tg and wt mice . in the open field test, mice did not differ with respect to the time spent in zones  . however, tg mice showed increased velocity   as well as distance travelled . there were no differences between groups in exploratory activity, locomotor coordination, motor learning and acoustic startle response .

enhanced spatial learning and cognitive flexibility
morris water maze, a sensitive test for hippocampus-dependent learning/memory processes  <cit> , yielded comparable performance of tg and wt in the visible platform task . in contrast, in the hidden platform task, a significant effect of days  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) as well as a significant effect of genotype  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) and no interaction effect  were observed . the tendency of a different starting point on day one of the hidden platform task made us analyze the four trials of this day separately. the pattern obtained explains the tendency, even though 2-way anova for repeated measures failed to yield a significant genotype effect of the within-day curve . this pattern of faster within-day learning is lost with increased overall level of performance . to exclude hyperactivity as a potential confounding variable, we evaluated the distance travelled for locating the hidden platform, a parameter independent of swimming speed. again, there was a significant effect of genotype  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; figure 2g), indicating enhanced hippocampus-dependent learning and memory function in cepor tg mice. the similar performance level of both groups on day eight of the hidden platform paradigm  may explain the negative result in the probe trial  and allowed us to further assess cognitive flexibility of cepor tg mice using the reversal paradigm. again, 2-way anova for repeated measures revealed a significant effect of days  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), significant effect of genotype  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and a significant interaction effect  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). post-hoc analysis indicated a significant difference on day one . to further delineate performance of both groups on this critical day one, we applied a 2-way anova for repeated measures over the four trials of this day. both groups significantly improved over time  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). however, there was a significant genotype effect  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), pointing to faster adaptation of cepor tg mice to the new platform position .

enhanced synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus
we hypothesized that the improvements of hippocampal learning are associated with a higher degree of synaptic plasticity. to assess changes in synaptic function and plasticity at the schaffer collateral-ca <dig> synapse, extracellular field potential recordings were performed in stratum radiatum of the ca <dig> subfield of acute hippocampal tissue slices. basal synaptic function and neuronal excitability were judged on the basis of input-output curves and synaptic plasticity was tested by paired-pulse stimulation and long-term potentiation -inducing trains of tetanic stimuli. the absolute amplitudes and slopes of orthodromically evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials  did not differ significantly among wt and tg mice. however, the normalized input-output curves  were slightly right-shifted for cepor mice at low stimulation intensities . on average, half maximum response amplitudes were obtained with  <dig> μa and  <dig> μa stimuli in wt  and tg mice , respectively.

clear differences were observed in response to twin-pulse stimulation. in cepor tg mice, paired-pulse facilitation with interpulse durations of up to  <dig> ms was significantly increased as compared to wt mice . at the shortest interpulse interval tested , the fepsp amplitudes increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for wt  and tg mice , respectively, and fepsp slopes increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %.

ltp-inducing stimuli  also resulted in a more pronounced potentiation of fepsps in cepor mice. this augmentation was already evident during the initial phase of ltp right after high frequency stimulation and remained stable for the following  <dig> minutes analyzed, that is the phase considered as early ltp . immediately after tetanic stimulation, that is the phase being referred to as post-tetanic potentiation , fepsp amplitudes were increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for wt and tg mice, respectively, and fepsp slopes increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . this initial post-tetanic potentiation decayed over the course of three to five minutes and the evoked responses stabilized. one hour after ltp induction, fepsp amplitudes were still increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and fepsp slopes were elevated by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % .

social memory, attention and higher cognitive capacities
would epo-epor signaling also affect higher cortical functions that cannot be easily correlated with electrophysiological readouts? we first addressed social functions in cepor tg mice. while there were no differences in social interaction and social approach , cepor tg mice showed enhanced social memory . this behavior was not due to increased exploratory activity, since performance in the hole board test did not differ between groups . additionally, no differences in olfaction were detected between groups  indicating that this finding reflects improved memory function in the area of social interaction.

we next assessed attention and behavioral control in these mice using the 5-choice serial reaction time task   in this test, mice are trained on an everyday basis over many months to adequately respond to a short  light stimulus. light stimuli appear pseudorandomly in one of five equally distant stimulus holes. mice are only rewarded if they make a nose poke in the location where the light shows up. to be considered correct, responses have to occur in a short limited-time window after stimulus presentation. after reaching stable performance, this trained behavior is challenged via different interfering manipulations .

training under baseline conditions for  <dig> days revealed enhanced attentional abilities in cepor mice demonstrated by significantly lower reaction times  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , figure 4b). post-hoc analysis indicated a significant difference in the first trial block  . this pattern remained robust even in face of higher cognitive challenges in intervention phase  <dig>   =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; effect of inter-trial interval  f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; effect of interaction f =  <dig> ), p =  <dig> , figure 4c). post-hoc evaluation revealed significantly lower reaction times in cepor tg mice in iti <dig> and iti <dig> . furthermore, cepor tg mice tended to show less premature responses in int <dig> compared to wt littermates  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , figure 4d). since progression until 'recovery4' is performance-dependent, unifying various aspects of learning and cognitive control, we analyzed the proportion of mice finishing this phase until experimental day  <dig>  survival analysis showed a significant difference between groups , indicating overall faster task progression in cepor tg mice .

resistance to behavioral distracters
having obtained a consistently superior performance of tg mice in the whole series of consecutive 5-csrtt attentional challenges, we exposed the mice to interfering acoustic stimuli. in the intervention phase  <dig> , mice were randomly confronted either with trials, where a sound distracter was simultaneously applied with a short light stimulus, or with trials lacking such distracting auditory stimulus. the effect of the sound distracter on attentional accuracy was investigated. in cepor tg mice, the sound distracter did not affect attentional accuracy  in contrast to wt littermates where sound distraction led to a decrease in accuracy . reaction times showed here only borderline significance . sound distraction led to a similar increase in reaction times in both groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , figure 4g).

increased impulsivity and reduced behavioral control under challenge
experimental cepor transgene expression was not ubiquitous in all epo responsive cells in the brain, but restricted to forebrain pyramidal neurons, suggesting that a natural balance of stimulatory and inhibitory circuits may have been perturbed. we therefore wondered whether overall superior cognitive performance would come at a 'price' and searched for subtle behavioral defects. indeed, an interesting behavioral abnormality was impulsivity. under conditions of long inter-trial intervals  in combination with variable, short stimulus duration, cepor tg mice tended to have more omissions compared to wt littermates . in contrast to their resistance towards attentional distractions, cepor tg mice had more premature responses in the task where they were confronted with sound distracters, that is responses that occurred before the light-coupled sound appeared . to address whether signs of increased impulsivity are also detectable in simpler readouts of this behavioral feature, we performed the marble burying test. indeed, cepor tg mice buried more marbles compared to wt littermates . thus, confining enhanced epor activity to glutamatergic cortical projection neurons in the reported experiment may have specific disadvantages, and it will be interesting to compare the here obtained behavioral pattern with the in vivo effects of enhanced epo-epor signaling in other neuronal subpopulations.

discussion
in order to investigate how the epo system influences cognitive performance and synaptic plasticity, and to experimentally prove that previously reported effects of rhepo on cognition in patients are independent of epo effects on hematopoiesis/brain oxygen supply, we created a novel mouse model with constitutive epor expression in cortical and hippocampal neurons that are defined by α-camkii promoter activity. this way, we were able to specifically mimic epo system function independent of any ligand in pyramidal neurons of cortex and hippocampus, that is regions pivotal for learning and memory processes. in other words, we 'over-accentuated' the endogenous action of the epo system in specific cortical and hippocampal layers, particularly the ca <dig> subregion  <cit> , to delineate the contribution of these neuronal subpopulations to the epo effects on cognition. we found that selective constitutive expression of epor in forebrain neurons leads to a phenotype with superior performance in higher cognitive tasks. behaviorally, this phenotype is accompanied by slightly increased activity and impulsivity. electrophysiologically, both short- and long-term plasticity at the schaffer collateral ca <dig> synapses are significantly increased in cepor expressing tg mice.

field potential recordings revealed augmented paired-pulse facilitation, short-term potentiation and ltp in cepor tg mice. one possible cause for the differences observed in the twin-pulse stimulation results might be the slight right shift of the input-output curves which suggests somewhat reduced baseline excitability and thus leaves more room for potentiated response. even though the detailed underlying molecular mechanisms cannot be determined on the basis of our extracellular recordings, the enhanced paired-pulse facilitation confirms that an increased number of transmitter quanta can be released in cepor tg mice . accordingly, the dynamic range of synaptic plasticity  is clearly extended as compared to wt mice.

the gain in paired-pulse facilitation is comparable to changes observed earlier in mice receiving epo injections  <cit> . however, in cepor tg mice, ltp stabilized at higher levels. since both paired-pulse facilitation and ltp are augmented, both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms seem to contribute to the improved synaptic plasticity. upon high frequency stimulation , the immediate phase of post tetanic potentiation is known to be independent of kinase activity  <cit> . the following  <dig> minutes of ltp reflect 'early ltp', which at the schaffer collateral ca <dig> synapse is nmda receptor dependent, involves activation of various kinases leading to ampa receptor phosphorylation, but is independent of protein synthesis and/or gene transcription  <cit> . interestingly, some of the kinases involved in the phosphorylation events during early ltp  are indeed part of the epo signaling cascades  <cit>  and thus might constitute putative sites of signal convergence. nevertheless, the enhanced spatial learning and cognitive flexibility observed in cepor tg mice suggest that, even though not evaluated electrophysiologically, the late phase of ltp, that is the phase requiring gene transcription and protein synthesis, is augmented as well  <cit> .

a detailed and comprehensive behavioral-cognitive analysis of cepor tg mice was performed to demonstrate that increased epo signaling in cortex and hippocampus enhances a whole array of learning and memory processes, as well as cognitive flexibility and attentional capacities, reflected by shorter reaction times and reduced distractibility through competing irrelevant auditory stimuli. very similar higher cognitive tasks were found improved in human patients upon several months of weekly high-dose intravenous epo treatment  <cit> , pointing to specific targets of epo action on cognition that are common to both mice and humans. augmented epor signaling in cepor tg mice also improved social memory, which is partly dependent on hippocampal functions  <cit> . we note that a recent study reported on better facial recognition performance in patients with major depression following high-dose epo application  <cit> , supporting social cognition as another selective target of epo effects across species.

it is important to point out that there are clear differences between epo effects on higher cognition upon systemic administration to healthy mice  <cit>  as compared to the selective and specific stimulation of the epo system in forebrain pyramidal neurons reported here. in contrast to mice receiving intraperitoneal epo injections  <cit> , the cepor tg mice did not show improved performance in the  initial 5-csrtt training phases. their superiority, however, was pronounced in the highest cognitive challenge tasks, demanding tremendous attentional capacities.

surprisingly, under cognitively most challenging conditions, cepor tg mice demonstrated more premature responses as readout of impaired behavioral impulse control  <cit> . the slightly hyperactive and impulsive phenotype of cepor tg mice was further confirmed by a simple additional assay - the marble burying test. behavioral consequences of this kind were not noted upon high-dose epo treatment where the cellular target is defined by the almost ubiquitous presence of epor throughout the brain. a potential explanation for the cepor tg phenotype of impulsivity and hyperactivity might be the continuous stimulation of the epo system exclusively in cortical projection neurons. since the frontal cortex has reciprocal projections to subcortical and basal brain regions , responsible for locomotion, motivation and impulsivity , the excitation of frontal pyramidal neurons might lead to a relative deficit in the simultaneous inhibitory regulation of these areas, consistent with a disturbance of the homeostatic balance within neuronal networks, resulting in impulsivity and hyperactivity of tg mice. this hypothesis is presently under systematic investigation in our laboratory through selected cepor expression in subpopulations of inhibitory interneurons.

interestingly, there is an ongoing debate regarding the nature of brain epor. the fact that non-hematopoietic but neuroprotective epo variants have been identified makes the additional existence of a different epor in the brain very likely . indeed, the work of xiong and others  <cit>  may well be interpreted along these lines. these authors demonstrated in a traumatic brain injury model worse outcome of neural epor-deficient mice, but, surprisingly, beneficial effects of epo treatment even in the absence of the 'classical' neural epor. moreover, they found that epor null mice per se are not impaired in spatial learning, indicating that the 'classical' brain epor may not be crucial for this task. this again emphasizes that the superior performance of cepor tg mice in spatial learning and memory, induced by over-activation of one selected population of neurons only, is partly explained by the provoked dysbalance in neuronal networks. in fact, some of the cognitive phenotypes observed here may also be derived from over-activation of downstream signaling cascades in neurons which are not endogenously triggered by epo, thereby creating a somewhat 'artificial' scenario. nevertheless, the cepor approach taken here may ultimately help to delineate the role of discrete neuronal subpopulations in cognitive processes.

epo and epor are expressed at very high levels in the developing central nervous system  <cit> . in contrast, their expression is markedly reduced postnatally and remains low in the normal adult brain  <cit> . both genes are upregulated under disease conditions in various different cell types in the brain, possibly to exert neuroprotective effects  <cit> . our present data indicate that activated epor serves a role in neuroplasticity, independent of and in addition to its anti-apoptotic neuroprotective tasks. since the steady-state level of both receptor and ligand is nevertheless low in the uninjured brain, we suggest that this function may also be disease-relevant. we propose a model in which epo-epor induction under disease conditions not only prevents neuronal cell death, but also triggers the enhanced neuronal plasticity that is required to functionally compensate for lost neuronal functions. it is intriguing that this could indicate a strategy of the neocortex, which is known to provide striking functional compensations after injury.

CONCLUSIONS
this study, together with our previous work, strongly supports a biological role for epo in cognitive processes. the potential of this role should be exploited to define novel strategies to therapeutically enhance brain plasticity and cognitive performance in disease conditions.
