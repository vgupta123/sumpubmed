BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis is a complex multistage process involving thousands of genes, and it is especially difficult to study in mammals  <cit> . in essence it is the process in males by which diploid cells give rise to haploid gametes. briefly, germline cells are derived from primordial germ cells , that give rise to primitive spermatogonia a . some daughter cells of mitotically dividing psgas differentiate into more advanced spermatogonia a subtypes, which eventually give rise to spermatogonia b and proceed through the stages of meiotic spermatocytes into spermatids and mature sperm  <cit> . meiosis is central to gametogenesis, and in male mice it starts about  <dig> days post partum . the outcome of meiosis of a single spermatogonium is four haploid spermatids. meiosis lasts about two weeks in mice and consists of two divisions, i and ii. the primary spermatocytes replicate their maternal and paternal chromosomes and then, in meiosis i, undergo a unique process in which the homologous parental chromosomes recombine with each other. recombination generates genetic diversity and ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes. errors in recombination can lead to either too few or too many chromosomes in the spermatids, a phenomenon referred to as aneuploidy. the secondary spermatocytes divide further in meiosis ii which is comparatively very brief, a matter of hours, and is similar to a mitotic division. meiosis ii yields haploid spermatids which proceed through spermiogenesis resulting in sperm . recombination of homologous chromosomes takes place during prophase of meiosis i, which consists of five stages: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis, in that order, the longest of which is pachytene. in the first wave of spermatogenesis, a relatively synchronous first cycle of sperm production after birth, pachytene begins at around 12- <dig> dpp. during this wave, the proportions of the various cell types in the testes change over time, while consecutive waves of spermatogenesis gradually become desynchronized. the process of germ cell development is directly assisted by various somatic cells present in testes. despite the critical importance of spermatogenesis, its complex developmental program and its accompanying changes in gene expression are still not fully understood.

two alternative approaches have been used to study gene expression during spermatogenesis. one uses cell sorting to separate and characterize the various cell types  <cit> . another is based on examining gene expression in the different cell populations present throughout the first wave of spermatogenesis  <cit> . both of these sets of studies have used microarrays. until recently, high-throughput rna sequencing approaches have been used to characterize spermatogenesis in a much more restricted way focusing either on a single developmental time point  <cit>  or on comparisons between pairs of neighboring time points  <cit> . a recent paper  <cit>  utilized rna-seq of sorted cells to study the transcriptome of mouse testes. rna sequencing has several important advantages compared to microarrays – better sensitivity, a greater dynamic range and the ability to detect every expressed gene or splicing variant/isoform, even if previously unknown  <cit> .

here we analyzed gene expression during first wave of spermatogenesis in murine pups using rna-seq in order to discover novel genes and isoforms active in spermatogenesis and meiosis. we analyzed testis samples from  <dig> to  <dig> day old mice with two-day sampling intervals between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp to improve the coverage of meiotic samples. we classified gene expression profiles and compared our results to previous microarray-based studies  <cit> . this comparison allowed us to identify genes that were not previously described as meiotically-expressed in high-throughput studies. we then developed a deconvolution algorithm to computationally determine cell type-specific gene expression and estimated gene expression levels in somatic cells, pre-meiotic spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatozoa. we validated our predictions by comparing them to the experimentally derived measurements of mrna levels in cell-sorted samples from whole testis  <cit> . rna-seq data were further mined to describe alternative splicing patterns and alternative polyadenylation site usage during spermatogenesis. using our rna-seq data we further evaluated computationally predicted gene models. finally, we measured the genome-wide distribution of rna pol ii  at two different time points and compared it with gene expression in spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
rna-seq of mouse spermatogenesis
in order to study gene expression during spermatogenesis, we sequenced mrna samples from whole testes of pre-pubertal mice at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post partum  which include the meiotic stages of the first wave of spermatogenesis. we also analyzed pre-meiotic  and adult  samples. we generated between  <dig> and  <dig> millions of reads for each sample . there were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million genomic locations with uniquely aligned reads . to estimate the quality of our protocol of mrna preparation and sequencing, we plotted the average read coverage of all genes relative to the position within the transcript . these distributions are mostly even for all samples indicating that the rna samples were subjected to limited degradation.

overall, we find that around 85% of protein coding genes might be expressed at each time point . such a high proportion of expressed genes may be at least in part explained by the presence of many cell types in our samples  <cit> . a stricter criterion of gene expression is the observation of exon splicing: in each sample, we see spliced reads in over 50% of protein-coding genes . although the vast majority of genes are expressed in our samples,  <dig>  protein coding genes were not detected in any of the samples. olfactory receptor  genes were highly enriched among those non-expressed genes . although some olfactory receptor genes are expressed in various tissues including testis, most of the members of the superfamily are expressed only in olfactory sensory neurons  <cit> . thus, the observed enrichment of olfr genes is consistent with the neuronally-restricted expression pattern of the majority of olfactory receptors.

temporal expression clusters
to functionally characterize the global gene expression patterns we clustered the gene expression profiles using k-means. we only considered genes with a sufficiently high expression level in at least one of the  <dig> samples , which change their expression by at least 2-fold, and have an mrna transcript length of at least  <dig> bases. as a first approximation, for most genes with varying expression their expression either decreases or increases monotonically with time . one group of genes  is mainly expressed only in the adult sample, indicating that these genes turn on late in spermatogenesis. the expression of the majority of the clustered genes decreases with age . however, some genes for which expression peaks in the middle of the time course are also discernible. to have a finer resolution of gene profiles, we split them into  <dig> clusters .

next, we compared our clustering with three previously published papers – chalmel et al.  <cit> , shima et al.  <cit>  and schultz et al.  <cit> . overall we find a good agreement - 89% or more genes present in common are classified similarly . to further validate our clustering results we looked at several well known genes associated with meiosis and their corresponding clusters in the present study, as well as in the three microarray studies discussed above . while there is an overall agreement for genes interrogated by both platforms, there are some potentially misclassified genes in the microarray studies. for example, dmc <dig> is in the post-meiotic  cluster of chalmel et al., while mnd <dig> is in the early expression cluster a of shima et al. in fact, dmc <dig> and mnd <dig> genes play important roles during meiotic recombination and belong to our intermediate cluster  <dig> . in agreement with our clustering, immunohistochemical analysis of dmc <dig> protein found it in leptotene-to-zygotene spermatocytes  <cit> . another example is prdm <dig> gene, which has recently attracted much attention due to its role in determining meiotic recombination  <cit> . there are no probe sets for this gene in the affymetrix microarrays used in  <cit>  and  <cit> , and it was not classified in  <cit> , probably due to a lack of a signal. similarly, the recently characterized gene spata <dig> <cit> , known to be essential for meiotic progression, is also absent from the microarrays.

while dmc <dig> and mnd <dig> are found in our cluster  <dig> – see figure  <dig> – they are either misclassified, or unclassified by the microarray-based study of shima et al.  <cit>  and chalmel et al.  <cit> . note that there were no affimetrix probes in the regions of the spata <dig> gene and prdm <dig> gene . genes marked with  have not been either interrogated or classified in the microarray studies  <cit> .

henceforth, we identify clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as meiotic clusters, given that the expression levels of genes belonging to these clusters rise coincident with the appearance of various meiotic cell types. we find that in these meiotic clusters  there are a total of  <dig>  genes. out of these  <dig>  genes nearly a quarter  were either not present on microarrays or were not differentially expressed in previous microarray studies  <cit>  . we thus refer to these genes as novel meiotic genes. we must clarify, however, that together with more than  <dig> uncharacterized or poorly characterized genes, some genes with solidly established meiotic function but that were not characterized by microarrays are on this list. these genes include prdm <dig>  spata <dig>  morc <dig>  mei <dig> and mlh <dig>  to avoid any ambiguity we emphasize that our “novel meiotic genes” do not have to be expressed in testis exclusively and include some genes with previously assigned meiotic function that were not previously characterized as meiotic in other high throughput studies.

in silico determination of cell type-specific gene expression
our gene expression data set is temporal – we have measurements of gene expression levels in whole mouse testis at different ages. testes consist of somatic and pre-meiotic germ cells, meiotic spermatocytes and post-meiotic spermatids and each of these cell types contains numerous subtypes that have their own characteristic gene expression profiles  <cit> . thus, the observed gene expression level in a sample prepared from a total testis is a sum of gene expression levels from individual cell types. moreover, during the first wave of spermatogenesis, the proportions of different cell types change drastically. to better understand functional processes during the course of spermatogenesis it would be desirable to obtain estimates of cell type-specific gene expression. here we use a computational approach to deconvolve temporal gene expression profiles from a mixture of cell types into cell-type specific expression profiles . a similar approach has been proposed and tested in the literature  <cit> , although typically with fewer cell types and for microarrays.

we took advantage of the digital nature of rna-seq data, and developed a weighted least squares optimization algorithm that allowed us to estimate gene expression levels in individual cell types . briefly, starting with initial estimates of cell type proportions, we estimate cell type-specific gene expression, which in turn can be used to iteratively re-estimate cell type proportions. the initial estimate of cell type fractions is based on previously reported values  <cit>  with some of the cell types grouped together . based on mathematical, as well as biological considerations, we chose to divide all cells into five cell types  a through e . the fraction of non-meiotic cells  drops significantly from  <dig> dpp to adult mice, while proportions of different germ cell populations rise and decay throughout the time course . although there were no zygotene spermatocytes at  <dig> dpp in our initial estimate, they appear after  <dig> iterations, which is consistent with previously published experimental data  <cit> . similarly, we also found that the contribution of spermatids  to the expression in whole testis is negligible at and before  <dig> dpp. similar to the clustering of temporal gene expression, we also clustered cell type-specific gene expression . this clustering associates genes with certain cell types, similar to the classification of cell-sorted gene expression in  <cit>  .

the summary of cell type-specific gene expression obtained after  <dig> iterations can also be represented as a heatmap  that shows that most genes are expressed in one or two cell types. there are many genes that are expressed both in somatic, a, and in one of the germ cell types. also, there is a significant overlap in gene expression between pachytene and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids, d and e. this observation, which is based on a purely computational analysis of temporal expression data, is in agreement with previous experimental observations  <cit> .

furthermore, we have compared our cell type-specific gene expression predictions to a recently published study  <cit>  that measured gene expression of sorted sertoli and germ cells using rna-seq. there is a good correlation between the experimental measurements of gene expression reported in  <cit>  and our deconvolution estimates . we have clustered the reported experimental gene expression into  <dig> clusters, each corresponding to one of the cell types considered in  <cit> . this produced an overall consistent gene classification between our clusters a through e and the five clusters we derived from  <cit> . drawn as a heatmap, gene expression from  <cit>  resembles the pattern of our cell-type expression heatmap .

soumillon et al.  <cit>  also define four expression clusters – cluster  <dig> has high gene expression in spermatocytes and spermatids, relative to spermatogonia and spermatozoa, and cluster  <dig> is the opposite; cluster  <dig> is high in spermatogonia and spermatids versus spermatocytes and, to a lesser extent, spermatozoa; cluster  <dig> is low in spermatozoa relative to the three other types. sertoli cells are not shown in this clustering. a comparison of the genes shared in our deconvolution clusters a-e and those in these four clusters shows that cluster  <dig> mostly corresponds to our clusters d and e, cluster  <dig> to our clusters a and b, and clusters  <dig> and  <dig> mostly correspond to our cluster c. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> share very few genes with any of our clusters, because many genes in these clusters from  <cit>  have low levels of expression. this can also be seen in the comparisons of our temporal clusters with those of  <cit>  .

looking at cell type-specific gene expression , we found that more genes are expressed in somatic a, while fewer genes are expressed in germ cell types . the median expression is largest in c –  <dig> rpkm vs. 15- <dig> rpkm in other cell types. in addition, there are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in cell types a, b, c, d and e, respectively, that are classified as expressed exclusively in those cell types.

while our statement that fewer genes are expressed in individual germ cell types than in somatic type a seems to disagree with the statements in  <cit>  that more genes are expressed in germ cell types than in sertoli cells, there are several factors to consider. first, our type a includes not only sertoli cells ; second, we only considered a subset of genes for the deconvolution procedure; third, the deconvolution procedure attempts to minimize the number of expressed genes needed to explain the observed temporal expression data, and is conservative in that sense; fourth, the experimental cell sorting purity is on average around 90% and so gene expression from other cell types might be observed – hence, cell sorting is a permissive approach. our finding that the median expression is largest in c  resembles the high per cell rna count in spermatocytes reported in  <cit> .

using the deconvolution results, we can associate temporal clusters with specific cell types. while this could in principle be done based on the timeline of spermatogenesis, here we have a quantification of this correspondence. for example, temporal cluster  <dig> has the highest contribution from b  while temporal cluster  <dig> is dominated by d  .

one way to validate our predictions is to look at some well-known genes. we found that, overall, these genes have been properly classified . for example, the synaptonemal complex genes sycp1- <dig> were mostly found expressed in zygotene , protamines are expressed in spermatids , dmc <dig> was found in pre-leptotene and leptotene primary spermatocytes, and many sertoli cell markers were correctly classified in cluster a . spermatogonia genes  were classified correctly as well. also, as cell type a includes primitive type a spermatogonia, the assignment of cdh <dig> to cluster a is appropriate  <cit> . further details are discussed in materials and methods.

alternative splicing
one of the advantages of mrna-seq over microarrays is that all expressed targets can be assessed. we were interested in finding novel exon-exon splice junctions, which represent new alternative isoforms of known genes. first, we checked our ability to detect known splices in our data . we found that the majority of known splices can be detected. pooling all the experiments together, we detected ~75% of about 2x <dig> known splices. the sensitivity of splicing detection decreases for individual samples, but we still observed at least 50% of known splices in each of our individual samples.

we then considered all annotated exons within each gene and constructed a list of all possible splice junctions . overall, we found support for about  <dig>  new junctions . although many of these novel splicing variants are expressed at a low level, some were rather abundant.

we found that 38%  of the novel intra-isoform exon skips  preserve an open reading frame . the extent of orf preservation is higher for highly-expressed novel splices, with five out of the top six splices – in genes r3hdm <dig> , atp8b <dig> , usp <dig> , wt <dig>  and supt5h  – being orf-preserving. importantly, these abundant novel orf-preserving splices constitute a significant fraction of the total gene expression. on average, the maximal proportion of novel isoform expression is above 43%, for splice junctions with at least  <dig> independent reads. one of the particularly abundant novel variants is the skipping of a coding exon  in the supt5h gene with the preservation of the orf . this gene participates in the regulation of mrna processing and transcription elongation by rna polymerase ii. expression of this novel splice junction at  <dig> dpp to  <dig> dpp is on the order of  <dig> to  <dig> rpkm, rising at later time points, while supt5h expression as a whole is between  <dig> to  <dig> rpkm for 6- <dig> dpp. hence, this novel splice isoform can contribute a significant fraction to the total gene’s expression, especially later in spermatogenesis. this suggests that this supt5h isoform might be important for sperm maturation.

in the novel splices, we asked how many exons are skipped, when compared to the known isoforms. typically  <dig> to 90% of our novel splices involve skipping one exon , and about 6-8% skip two exons . while most novel splices skip one exon, there are exceptions like the skipping of exons  <dig> through  <dig> in the spermatogenesis-associated gene spata <dig>  however, the orf is not preserved. finally, we detected  <dig> novel exon-exon junctions that could only be formed by splicing exons present exclusively in alternative known isoforms of a given gene. out of these  <dig> junctions,  <dig>  preserve the orf, suggesting that they represent functional transcript variants.

gene predictions
since rna-seq data are not restricted to annotated genes, we looked at regions of high expression outside of any of the ucsc knowngene, refgene and xenorefgene lists. interestingly, for many such regions with a high level of expression there was an associated  genscan gene prediction. hence we asked whether we can detect meiotic expression of computationally predicted putative genes. we compared rna-seq reads to those expected from gene models of the ensembl and genscan databases. our data yielded support for  <dig> gene models from ensembl, that don’t overlap with annotated genes found in the ucsc knowngene, refgene and xenorefgene  tables. to ensure a high level of specificity, we demanded that we observe at least one predicted splice site for the models considered which would constitute an additional indication of transcription and transcript processing . similarly, we found support for  <dig> genscan gene models that do not overlap with any known genes . most of these models are expressed at low levels, with only  <dig> showing maximal expression above  <dig> rpkm . one interesting example is the genscan model chrx. <dig> demonstrating a meiotic upregulation, peaking at  <dig> dpp with  <dig> rpkm. this model has  <dig> exons; we see  <dig> splice junctions,  <dig> of which are splices between neighboring exons. therefore, there is evidence for alternative splicing as well. we note that out of the  <dig> genscan gene models, only  <dig> overlap the  <dig> ensembl models described above.

recently, a class of large intervening non-coding rnas  has been described and studied. they are proposed to form ribonucleic-protein complexes acting in numerous cellular pathways. in mouse, these lincrnas have been obtained from four cell types not involved in spermatogenesis  <cit> . we asked whether we had evidence for expression of any of these lincrnas in our data, and how it changed over time. combining lincrna genomic regions and exonic structures reported in  <cit>  yielded  <dig>  gene structures that don’t overlap known ucsc genes. given that these gene structures were not manually curated, we conservatively restricted our analysis to long structures with high and variable expression , in order to focus on potentially more reliable variants. this filtering yielded  <dig> structures , which can be interesting candidates for future studies .

since lincrnas are defined as non-coding transcripts, we also analyzed known ucsc genes that are annotated as non-coding. there are  <dig>  such genes.  <dig>  of them have maximal rpkm >  <dig>  at least a 2-fold change in expression and an mrna length at least  <dig> bases;  <dig> of these transcripts overlap lincrnas. with stricter thresholds,  <dig> of the  <dig>  non-coding genes have maximal rpkm >  <dig>  fold change >  <dig> and an mrna length at least 1 kb;  <dig> of them overlap lincrnas. as we are mostly interested in meiosis, gene ak <dig> caught our attention, as its expression peaks quite sharply at  <dig> dpp with around  <dig> rpkm. we noticed that this gene has two isoforms in the ensembl and vega annotations, both with coding potential. moreover, our rna-seq data suggested that none of these annotations accounted for the observed coverage toward the 3′ end of the transcript. computationally predicted genscan transcript chr <dig>  was closer to the observed rna-seq read coverage. we therefore performed a detailed reconstruction of this transcript. the result is mostly the merger of the 5′ part from the ensembl/vega annotations with the 3′ part from the genscan predictions, with additional corrections to exon boundaries in some exons. the resulting two possible very similar transcripts are protein coding, and possess an hmg-box, a dna-binding domain, towards their 3′ end . their predicted protein lengths are  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa . given that its expression profile is highly similar to that of the prdm <dig> gene, this novel gene is an interesting candidate for further study.

polyadenylation
one of the mechanisms regulating gene expression is alternative polyadenylation  <cit> . while our experiments were not specifically designed to address this question, our data contain multiple reads covering polyadenylation sites. hence, we asked whether we could detect alternative polyadenylation during spermatogenesis and to what extent. we implemented a mapping strategy based on partial mapping of previously unmapped reads, together with observation of a polyadenylation tail and a polyadenylation signal . mapping reads to the whole genome, we identify  <dig>  candidate polyadenylation sites .  <dig>   candidate sites lie within known gene transcripts ± <dig> bases, and of those  <dig>   are at  <dig> bases or less from the closest known 3′ transcription end.  <dig>  candidate sites are right at the known 3′ transcript end . there are over  <dig>  genes, many of which have multiple isoforms/transcripts, some of which have distinct 3′ ends. as there are  <dig>  known transcripts we detect only ~10% or less of known 3′ ends.

in summary, out of  <dig>  candidate sites,  <dig>  are within  <dig> bases from known sites, while  <dig>  sites are farther away. about half of the latter are within known gene bodies. such sites are potentially novel sites of alternative polyadenylation. extrapolating these numbers to all genes, we estimate that there can be over  <dig>  alternative polyadenylation sites active through spermatogenesis. this finding is consistent with recent work highlighting the abundance of alternative polyadenylation  <cit> .

meiotic sex chromosome inactivation
gene expression on the x chromosome is strongly repressed in pachytene via a process known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation   <cit> . our data show clear evidence of msci – gene expression of x-linked genes drops dramatically beginning around  <dig> dpp  and there are no x-linked genes in the late meiotic clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . similarly, our deconvolution results show only  <dig> x-linked genes with pachytene  expression, and in all these cases, except one , the estimated expression in d is small compared to the expression in some of the other cell types. post-meiotically, however, the x chromosome is no longer strongly repressed and many x-linked genes belong to temporal cluster  <dig> and are expressed in cell type e.

rna polymerase ii chip-seq
rna polymerase ii is responsible for transcription of pre-mrnas as well as various non-coding rnas. to study the correlation of pol ii binding with gene expression in spermatogenesis, we performed two pol ii chip-seq experiments, on testes of  <dig> and 16dpp mice, and used a third, published dataset for adult testis  <cit> . typically, we see a clear pol ii binding signal at ~36% of annotated transcription start sites , and sometimes an increased signal along genes . there is a noticeable correlation between the level of gene expression and the strength of the pol ii signals measured at  <dig> and  <dig> dpp – spearman correlation is in the range  <dig>  –  <dig> , and is highest at or around the matching time point. significantly, the correlation is high not only for a pol ii signal around gene tss’s, but also in the gene bodies, 1 kb and farther downstream from tss’s .

we detected accumulation of pol ii at ~ <dig>  canonical transcription start sites  and ~ <dig> genes use known alternative tss’s instead. of the remaining genes, 100- <dig> have strong pol ii peaks within the gene body. overall, ~ <dig>  strong pol ii peaks lie within gene bodies , and there is a similar number of strong peaks farther than 1 kb from annotated gene bodies. using more comprehensive sets of predicted pol ii promoters and tss locations ), we observed an increased overlap with our pol ii signals . we also observed pol ii in cpg islands and overlapping histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation  marks  <cit> , associated with active promoters .

we found that the majority of active gene promoters  have an accumulation of pol ii at all three time points  . about half of the  <dig>  genes with unambiguously assigned tss’s have at least one of their possibly multiple tss’s occupied by pol ii at at least one time point. dissecting the genes by their expression cluster, we saw the expected picture of a higher 10dpp pol ii promoter occupancy in early expression clusters and a higher adult pol ii promoter occupancy in late expression clusters . we also considered genes with roughly constant expression , and genes with low expression . 88% of genes with roughly constant expression  have their promoters occupied in at least one of the three time points considered, and 82% in all three time points. in contrast, only 7% of weakly or non-expressed genes  have pol ii signals at their promoters at some point, and these signals are weak.

to address whether there is promoter occupancy by pol ii but no or low expression, we focused on late expression clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  and looked for genes with a pol ii signal at 10dpp. this yielded  <dig> out of  <dig> genes for cluster  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> genes for cluster  <dig>  we also considered genes from cluster  <dig> with a pol ii signal at 16dpp –  <dig> out of  <dig>  using david  <cit> , we found that these lists of genes are enriched in annotations like cytoskeleton, intracellular non-membrane-bounded organelle, microtubule, cell projection, cilium and related terms, with annotation clusters enrichment scores between  <dig>  and  <dig> . we note that these annotation terms are enriched even when the whole corresponding expression cluster is used as a background . thus it seems likely that genes responsible for sperm motility have significant accumulation of pol ii around their tss’s early on, but are expressed at relatively low levels until later. this observation is similar to the situation of a poised pol ii, which is quite ubiquitous during development  <cit> .

we also analyzed cases of gene expression without clear pol ii at annotated tss’s. we considered expression clusters ‘const’ and  <dig>  as one would expect to see pol ii at tss’s of all ‘const’ genes, and cluster  <dig> has the least percentage of genes with pol ii at tss’s. for the 'const' expression cluster most of the genes in question have in fact nearby pol ii at one of their annotated tss’s, which have been omitted due to either the ambiguity of assigning a tss interval to a gene , or because short gene transcripts were excluded; in some cases, the gene expression, or the mappability of the tss region is low; in yet other cases there seems to be an incorrect annotation, for example defining part of one transcript as a separate transcript with its own tss, leading to disagreements between the refseq and ucsc annotations. for expression cluster  <dig>  in addition to the above, there are cases of overlapping transcripts on opposite strands; sometimes pol ii signals are too weak to be called . another factor is that the adult pol ii chip data  <cit>  used by us seems to correlate better with gene expression at  <dig> and 20dpp than with 38dpp. certainly, some genes use un-annotated alternative tss’s, either within or outside of the annotated gene transcripts. one possible example is the tex <dig> gene whose putative un-annotated tss lies ~200 kb upstream of its annotated 5′ end .

discussion
identification of meiotically expressed genes
to define genes expressed in meiosis we sequenced the transcriptome of murine testes at eight time points during the first wave of spermatogenesis. we then applied two approaches for the identification of genes expressed during meiosis: clustering of temporal gene-expression profiles and computational deconvolution of temporal expression patterns into cell-type specific expression profiles. in four out of eight temporal expression clusters median expression rose between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp - a time period that corresponds to the meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. we thus designated genes from these clusters as meiotically expressed. a comparison of this gene list with previous publications allowed us to define  <dig>  novel meiotic genes which were not previously analyzed by microarray studies . as expected, our novel meiotic genes are significantly enriched in such meiosis-related gene ontology categories as microtubule-based movement and response to dna damage stimulus, among others .

our experimental measurements of gene expression levels constitute bulk expression estimates from heterogeneous samples containing various proportions of germ and somatic cells. to estimate gene expression levels in individual cell types we developed a computational deconvolution approach . using this deconvolution procedure, we found  <dig> genes  that are exclusively expressed in meiotic cell fractions c and d. out of them  <dig>  are novel. when we compare our temporal clustering classification with the deconvolution predictions, we find that  <dig> out of  <dig>  novel meiotic genes identified via clustering of the temporal gene expression profiles are highly expressed in the cell types that contain meiotic cells, b, c and d . thus, both of our analytic approaches define a consistent set of novel meiotic genes.

although the vast majority of annotated gene models in mouse have experimental support, there are numerous gene models predicted only using computer tools. here we find direct experimental support for  <dig> computationally predicted transcripts that don’t overlap known genes. also, based on partially correct computational models in the locus corresponding to the known non-coding gene ak <dig>  we predict a protein-coding putative gene of 566/ <dig> aa with a dna binding hmg box domain . the expression profile of this gene shows a sharp peak of transcription in meiosis, between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp.

meiotic sex chromosome inactivation
it is clear that msci suppresses x-linked gene expression in male meiosis . previously it has been suggested that msci persists beyond meiosis into spermiogenesis  <cit> . our temporal profiling results and in silico deconvolution allows us to estimate post-meiotic gene expression of x-linked genes and test the hypothesis that the x chromosome is still inactivated past meiosis. it has been reported  <cit>  that 13% to 18% of x-linked genes are expressed after the completion of meiosis in mouse. in our analysis, only 27% of x-linked genes are expressed in the post-meiotic deconvolution cell type e, compared to 46-59% of autosomal genes. in contrast, 85% of x-linked and 84-88% autosomal genes are expressed in the mostly somatic cell type a. moreover,  <dig> % of x-linked genes are expressed mostly in the post-meiotic deconvolution cell type e , a proportion that is lower than that for autosomal genes . thus, even though msci is relaxed after the completion of meiosis as suggested before  <cit> , the x chromosome is transcriptionally suppressed in post-meiotic cells. this is consistent with recent work  <cit> .

dynamics of rna polymerase ii binding patterns and their relation to gene expression
we supplemented our rna-seq data with rna polymerase ii chip-seq. while most promoters of expressed genes have a discernible pol ii chip-seq signal, thousands of locations far from annotated gene promoters display accumulation of pol ii. these locations can mark novel promoters or enhancers, or clusters of small rnas. indeed, comparison of the pol ii signals at 10dpp and 16dpp clearly identified activation of pachytene pirnas after 10dpp . consistent with previous findings  <cit> , we found an enrichment of pol ii in our 16dpp  sample in  <dig> out of  <dig> pirna clusters.

previous studies have shown that in development, gene promoters often harbor a poised pol ii at genes that remain suppressed until a certain developmental stage  <cit> . because spermatogenesis is also a developmental process, we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon might be happening here as well. while our experimental procedures  cannot determine if the observed pol ii is transcriptionally engaged  <cit> , we find that genes likely to be associated with sperm motility have a pol ii signal around their tss’s as early as at 10dpp. this suggests that promoter poising is common in spermatogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
here we created a comprehensive reference dataset of gene expression in mouse spermatogenesis. we analyzed expression in males aged from  <dig> dpp to  <dig> dpp effectively covering all stages of spermatogenesis from pre-meiotic cells to spermatozoa. we then computationally detected genes expressed pre-meiotically, early and late in meiosis and in sperm. since previous studies of gene expression during spermatogenesis in mouse were primarily performed using microarrays, only a subset of the genes was analyzed. unlike microarrays, our data cover essentially all mouse genes. an additional advantage of rna-seq compared to microarrays is superior sensitivity. these two factors allowed us to define over a  <dig>  novel meiotically-expressed genes. furthermore, our data show that alternatively spliced isoforms are abundantly represented through spermatogenesis. in total, we found more than  <dig>  of novel alternative splices some of which are highly expressed in meiosis. to further enhance our dataset and better define promoters we supplemented transcription profiling with rna polymerase ii chip-seq at three time points. this allowed us to describe temporal dynamics of pol ii behavior in spermatogenesis and detect numerous regions enriched for pol ii away from annotated genes. taken together, we believe that our integrated dataset is a valuable resource for further studies of gametogenesis and meiosis in vertebrates.
