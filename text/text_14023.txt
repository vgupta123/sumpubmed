BACKGROUND
variations in leaf colors are very special in the kingdom of plants, and different kinds of them have been reported  <cit> . thus far, more than  <dig> chl-deficient mutants have been discovered in rice, and they are referred to as virescent, stripe, albino, chlorina, zebra and yellow variegated according to their diverse phenotypes   <cit> . leaf color mutants have been utilized extensively in theoretical studies during the last several years. for example, leaf color mutants have been used to interpret the development of chloroplasts and metabolism of chlorophyll in plants  <cit> , and to illustrate the pathways of photosynthesis  <cit> , the mechanisms of photomorphism  <cit> , metabolism of phytohormones  <cit>  and molecular mechanisms of disease resistance  <cit> .

green-revertible albino is a special type of leaf color variation. leaf color of this type of mutant is albino under certain conditions or at certain developmental stages, while it shows green leaves gradually and thus guarantees the mutant to be able to grow and mature normally  <cit> , such as the rice mutant qiufeng m  <cit>  and low temperature albino  <dig>  <cit> . as a visualized marker, this type of variation has been used successfully in breeding male-sterile lines in rice and enhancing the seed purify of hybrids in plants . furthermore, some of these type of leaf color variations are reported to be controlled by temperature, such as the rice mutant low temperature albino  <dig>  <cit>  and maize inbred line a <dig>  <cit> . they can also be used to illustrate the mechanisms of sense and response of temperature in plant.

the completion of draft genome sequences of several higher plant species has opened an unprecedented opportunity for functional genomics studies in them  <cit> . in rice, more than  <dig> green-revertible albino mutants have been identified  <cit> . several genes responsible for this type of mutation have also been identified using the strategy of forward genetics. these genes are involved in diverse physiological processes. for example, one base substitution of c to t in the coding region of chloroplast protein synthesis elongation factor tu could result in the green-revertible albino  <cit> . the silence of cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp- <dig> maybe responsible for the low temperature induced seedling-specific albino  <cit> . the 5-bp deletion in the coding region of the pentatricopeptide repeat  gene generated a premature stop codon in rice mutant young seedling albino and caused the seedling-specific albino phenotype  <cit> . the 45-bp insertion occurred in the first exon of a heme oxygenase gene may lead to the green-yellow phenotype in rice  <cit> . in maize, “zebra <dig> ” showed transverse green/yellow striped leaves in young plants, and map-based-cloning demonstrated that zb <dig> encoded the lsph protein with a mis-sense mutation in a conserved region  <cit> .

on the other hand, combining classical bulked segregant analysis  with next generation sequencing  technology has made gene cloning essentially a single-step computational procedure once a mapping population has been established  <cit> . recently developed specific length amplified fragment sequencing  is an efficient method of large-scale genotyping, which is based on reduced representation library   <cit>  and high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . slaf-seq has been widely employed in many species , and was proven to be an effective strategy for construction of high density genetic map , identification of gene for qualitative trait  <cit>  as well as qtls for quantitative traits  <cit> .

as the fourth cereal crop of the world, barley  provides economically important source of human and animal nutrition and underpins the malting and brewing industries. barley also performs as a genetic model species for triticeae genomics  <cit> . the recently released whole genome sequence of barley cv. morex  <cit>  has opened an unprecedented opportunity for performing functional genomics studies in barley. however, the genetic basis of leaf color variations in barley was largely unexplored.

in the present study, traditional ssr marker assays and slaf-seq in conjunction with bsa were utilized to fine map a novel stage green-revertible albino gene  in barley mutant whs <dig>  the mutant was originally isolated from the malting barley variety edamai no.  <dig> and showed stable and inheritable character of stage green-revertible albino. the candidate genes were also discussed and analyzed in this study. the current study will provide a basis to clone and utilizing the gene that is responsible for the albino trait in the future.

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization of the barley stage green-revertible albino mutant “whs18”
“whs18” was a natural mutant of the malting barley variety “edamai no. 6”. after three years’ observation, we found that leaf color of whs <dig> showed stage green-revertible albino under the field condition. to be detailed, whs <dig> had wild-type leaf color at the seedling stage, while the seventh or eighth and later leaves showed etiolation , and albino leaves  emerged soon. the newly emerged leaves began to show stripe white  before the jointing stage, and normal green leaves  emerged gradually before heading time. thus, leaf color of whs <dig> could harbor the stereo model of “albino-stripe white-green”  after green leaves appeared again. leaves with different color at the corresponding stage were called green leaf at the seedling stage , etiolated leaf , albinistic leaf , stripe white , respectively. the whole developmental period with abnormal leaf color generally lasted for about  <dig> months.fig.  <dig> the dynamic leaf color variation of whs <dig> under field condition. a etiolated leaf b albino leaf c strip white leaf d stereo leaf color performance



the impact of temperature on the stage green-revertible albino of whs18
to analyze whether the color variation of whs <dig> was induced by environment, three different temperature treatments  were conducted on whs <dig>  after one month’s temperature treatment, we found that both of the seedlings in the incubator  and under the plastic membrane  grew much faster than the seedlings grown under normal condition  due to the warmer temperature. meanwhile, the seedlings grown outside began to show els, and showed stage green-revertible albino as expected . however, we didn’t observe any color variation for the seedlings either in the incubator or under the plastic membrane . another analysis showed that when encountered a period of low temperature, els and als emerged in all of the seedlings planted at three different dates , even though they have developed quite different numbers of leaves . the newly emerged leaves also showed green nearly at the same time .fig.  <dig> the phenotype of whs <dig> under different temperature treatment. a t1: whs <dig> grown inside or outside of incubator b t2: whs <dig> grown inside or outside of plastic membrane c t3-1: whs <dig> sowed at different date d t3-2: whs <dig> sowed at different date



effect of stage green-revertible albino on agronomic traits
to investigate the effect of the stage albino on agronomic trait of barley, we measured some yield related traits in edamai no. <dig> and whs <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  heading date  of whs <dig> was  <dig> days’ later than edamai no. <dig>  furthermore, stage albino significantly reduced the plant height  and length of the main spike  of barley for about 10 cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively. spike number per plant  and weight of  <dig> grains  were also decreased significantly by stage albino. while it seemed that the stage green-revertible albino didn’t have any significant effect on grain number of the main spike .table  <dig> comparison of agronomic traits between edamai no.  <dig> and whs <dig>

effect of stage green-revertible albino on photosynthesis relevant traits of barley
leaf color variations were also associated with abnormal chlorophyll metabolism. we quantified the contents of chlorophylls edamai no. <dig> and whs <dig> at different developmental stages to determine whether the albino phenotype of whs <dig> resulted from impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis. as expected, the amount of chlorophylls of edamai no. <dig> showed no significant change at different stages, while both of chlorophylla and chlorophyllb in whs <dig> showed a significant dynamic change of decrease to increase along with the leaf color changing from green to albino to green. the total chlorophyll in als of whs <dig> was less than one tenth of total chlorophyll in corresponding leaves of wt plants .table  <dig> concentration of chlorophylls in edamai no. <dig> and whs18

genetic analysis of the gene  controlling the mutant phenotype
to illustrate the genetic characteristics of the gene  controlling the phenotype of stage green-revertible albino, whs <dig> was crossed with two wild-type barley cultivars . our analysis showed that all of the four f <dig> population consisted of about  <dig> individuals showed normal phenotype, either use whs <dig> as the male or female parent. for all of the tested f <dig> populations, the segregation ratio of green and albino plants fit a 3: <dig> chi square test , suggesting that the inheritance of the stage green revertible albino in barley follows a simple mendelian inheritance pattern and behaves as a single recessive trait, and the gene controlling the trait was designed as hvsgra in this study.table  <dig> genetic analysis of the albino mutant

preliminary mapping of the hvsgra gene
to map the hvsgra gene, an f <dig> mapping population was generated from the cross between edamai no. <dig> and whs <dig>  more than  <dig> ssr primer-pairs distributing on the seven barley chromosomes were used to assay the two parents. about one-third of them showed polymorphism between the two parents. further bsa analysis indicated that the hvsgra gene was on chromosome 2h of barley. thus ssr markers on 2h were screened in the f <dig> population consisting of  <dig> albino individuals, and the hvsgra gene was mapped with two ssr markers gbms <dig> and gbm <dig> within a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm . further analysis anchored the two markers on morex_contig_ <dig> and morex_contig_ <dig> , respectively. the two contigs  were genetically positioned at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm of barley 2h chromosome, respectively.fig.  <dig> mapping of hvsgra gene.  primary mapping of hvsgra  fine mapping of hvsgra  physical mapping of hvsgra




slaf-seq was conducted on the two parents and two bulks with  <dig> normal or mutant individuals from the f <dig> population, respectively. the slaf-seq data analysis generated  <dig>  gb,  <dig>  gb,  <dig>  gb and  <dig>  gb data for edamai no. <dig>  whs <dig>  dominant bulk and recessive bulk, respectively. a total of  <dig>  slafs were generated, including  <dig>  snps,  <dig> repeat, and the other  <dig>  showed no polymorphism between the two parents.  <dig> diff-markers that are likely associated with the trait were identified after statistic analysis. a total of  <dig> of them could be anchored to the morex_contigs . then five regions with three or more diff-markers were considered for further analysis, including  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm on the short arm of chromosome 2h,  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm on the short arm of 6h,  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm on the long arm of 6h, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm on the long arm of 7h . number of diff_marker of each region was six, four, five, four and four, respectively .

fine mapping of the hvsgra gene
the result of the preliminary mapping using ssr and slaf-seq suggested that the hvsgra gene was in the interval of  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm on 2h of barley. in order to further fine map the hvsgra gene, the closest linked ssr marker gbms <dig> and gbm <dig> were used to screen a larger f <dig> population consisting of  <dig> albinos, and totally  <dig> recombinants were identified. two other ssr markers  between gbms <dig> and gbm <dig> were scored on the panel of  <dig> recombinants for the hvsgra interval. the candidate gene was finally located between bmac <dig> and awbms <dig> . the two ssr markers were anchored to morex_contig_ <dig> and morex_contig_ <dig> , respectively.

for our further analysis, several primer-pairs based on eight morex-contigs nearby morex_contig_ <dig> and morex_contig_ <dig> were designed and used to generate new molecular markers potentially linked to hvsgra gene. five primer-pairs of them showed polymorphism between the two parents , including mc <dig>  mc <dig>  mc <dig>  mc <dig> and mc <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  hvsgra showed cosegregation with mc <dig> and mc <dig> in the larger population consisting of  <dig> albino individuals. finally, the hvsgra was mapped between morex_contig_ <dig> and morex_contig_ <dig>  with the genetic distance being  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm , respectively. they were anchored to two adjacent fp_contigs of barley, contig_ <dig> and contig_ <dig> , respectively.fig.  <dig> genotype of the two parents and lines from the derived f <dig> population. lane1: edamai no. <dig>  lane2:whs <dig>  lane3-4: wild-type lines, l5-13: mutant lines



candidate gene analysis of hvsgra
our further analysis showed that there were  <dig> and  <dig> morex-contigs on contig_ <dig> and contig_ <dig>  respectively. six putative genes with high confidence on these morex_contigs were extracted from the most current popseq barley map  <cit> . they included cytochrome p <dig>  fructokinase-1-like , laccase and unknown genes .table  <dig> putative genes in the candidate region



all of these six genes were cloned and sequenced from the wild-type edamai no.  <dig> and the mutant whs <dig>  our final comparison between them showed that there were totally <dig> stable snps in the third exon of fructokinase-1-like gene hvfln <dig>  between edamai no. <dig> and whs <dig>  both on dna and cdna levels. most importantly, one of these snps was a substitution from c to a in whs <dig>  the substitution generated a premature stop codon of taa in whs <dig> . the coding region of the wild-type hvfln <dig> was 1734 bp in length and the substitution lead to the missing of  <dig> animo acids in c terminal of hvfln <dig> in whs <dig>  thus, the mature product of hvfln <dig> in whs <dig> was lack of the atp binding site of the kinase, which may lead to loss function of this gene in whs <dig>  the coding regions of the other five genes were exactly the same between edamai no.  <dig> and whs <dig>  our further analysis showed that the putative amino acid sequence encoded by hvfln <dig> showed  <dig> and 41 % similarity to atfln <dig>  and atfln <dig>  of arabidopsis, respectively .fig.  <dig> sequence comparison of the third extron of hvfln <dig> gene between edamai no. <dig> and whs <dig>  the red * indicated the snp that generated the premature stop codon in whs18

discussion
hundreds of mutants with altered leaf color have been previously described in plants, especially in arabidopsis  and rice  including green-revertible albino mutants. however, few were described in barley. cytoplasmic line  <dig>  was a cytoplasmically inherited chlorophyii-deficient mutant of barley. at emergence, the cl <dig> seedlings-phenotype varied from a grainy light green to an albino color, and gradually greened during the following days  <cit> . in this study, whs <dig>  a natural leaf color mutant of barley cultivar edamai no. <dig>  was characterized and analyzed. leaf color of whs <dig> was not only different from the wild type, but also was different at different developmental stages , including gl, el, aland sw. this phenomenon was called stage green-revertible albino in rice  <cit> . there has been no report about this type of leaf color variation in barley. characterization of the mutant and fine mapping of the gene will pave the way for map-based cloning of the gene and unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the variation. the mutant will also be a new gene resource for barley molecular breeding in future.

several leaf color variations have been reported to be induced by low temperature, such as the maize inbred line a661i, exposure of whose seedlings to low temperatures during early leaf biogenesis led to chlorophyll losses  <cit> . rice mutant low temperature albino  <dig>  showed albino leaves before 4-leaf stage when grown under temperature lower than 20 °c  <cit> . another rice mutant mr <dig> showed yellow leaf color under the temperature lower than 25 °c and turned green with an increase in temperature  <cit> . however, in the barley cytoplasmic line  <dig> mentioned above, higher temperatures during seed formation were negatively associated with pigment content in the seedlings, while higher temperature during the growth of its seedlings had an opposite effect on pigment content  <cit> . the abnormal leaf color of the rice mutant hfa- <dig> seemed to be induced by warm temperature too. leaf color of hfa- <dig> was albino when the temperature was between 25-30 °c, while it was yellow under the temperature of 15-20 °c  <cit> . to analyze the interaction between the color variation of whs <dig> and environment, whs <dig> was subjected to three different treatments. as shown in fig.  <dig>  both of the seedlings in the incubator and plastic membrane showed normal green leaves, while the seedlings grown outside showed abnormal leaf color after one month later . furthermore, seedlings sowing at different dates showed etiolation nearly at the same time , suggesting that the abnormal leaf color of whs <dig> was mainly induced by low temperature. actually, to analyze the precise shift temperature of the leaf color variation in whs <dig>  the 10-day-old seedlings of whs <dig> have been treated at the temperature of 10/0 °c, 10/ <dig>  15/ <dig> and 20/13 °c  for one month, respectively. however, we didn’t observe any color variation under those controlled conditions. on the other hand, the maximum and minimum temperatures were also recorded from mid-november  to the end of december  in  <dig>  we found that the minimum temperature of 10 days was 0 °c and 7 days was lower than 0 °c during this time , suggesting that the temperature under the ice-point may be crucial for the leaf color variation of whs <dig> 

as we all known, most of the leaf color variation couldn’t survive under normal condition, especially these albino mutants. stage green-revertible albino mutant was a special kind of leaf color mutant. this type of mutant could develop normal green leaves after the abnormal ones, which enabled it to flower and mature normally. for example, the green-revertible albino in rice qiufeng m lead to the significant reduction of neck length and 1000-grain weight at 1 % level, while the other agronomic characters investigated showed no significant difference between the mutant and the wild-type  <cit> . as compared to edamai no. <dig>  the abnormal vegetative growth in whs <dig> lead to the reduction of plant height and other yield related traits, including snp, ls, gns and wtg, and the hd was about eight days later in whs <dig> . it was probably because that the duration of whs <dig> with abnormal leaf color lasted for about three months, which was nearly half of the whole growing season of barley in wuhan city. the abnormal chlorophyll metabolism in these leaves  influenced the photosynthesis of these leaves, and then played some negative impact on these agronomic traits investigated.

most of the leaf color variations were controlled by one single recessive nuclear gene, and a few of them were also reported to be controlled by cytogene, such as the stage albinism line of winter wheat fa <dig>  <cit> . while the abnormal leaf color of mt <dig> was controlled by nucleo-cytoplasmic gene interaction  <cit> . our genetic analysis suggested that the stage green-revertible albino of whs <dig> was a qualitative trait that controlled by one single recessive nuclear gene  , which allowed us to hunt for this gene directly using the strategy of bsa based on molecular markers. we preliminarily mapped the hvsgra gene on chromosome 2h of barley using traditional bsa method.

recently, a large amount of data from ngs and modern tools enable us to extract putative genes in certain regions without a precise genomic sequence in barley. the strategy of mapping-by-sequencing has accelerated the forward genetics significantly in barley  <cit> . using the approach of mapping-by-sequencing applied on the whole-exome capture data, hvphytochrome c was identified as a candidate gene for the early maturity locus modulating the circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering in barley  <cit> . we assumed to conduct slaf-seq to develop closer snp markers linked to the gene. five regions were identified by slaf-seq and bsa, including the interval identified by traditional bsa . xia et al.  <cit>  also identified three independent candidate regions on chr <dig> of maize for a qualitative trait using the strategy of bsa based on slaf-seq, with only three diff_markers for each region. actually, ssr markers in the other four regions identified by slaf-seq  were also employed in our preliminary mapping analysis. these markers showed no polymorphism either between the two parents or the two pools, and they were excluded from our further analysis. thus the overlapped region identified by ssr and slaf-seq was considered the candidate region. on the other hand, marker density  in the hvsgra interval  identified by slaf-seq may be insufficient to pin the candidate gene in barley . similar phenomenon was also observed in cotton  <cit> . and our further map-based cloning based on the physical map of barley narrowed down the hvsgra interval to two morex_contigs on two adjacent fp_contigs of barley, contig_ <dig> and contig_ <dig> .

the recent release of the barley draft genome assembly  <cit>  provides a resource for pursuing the sgra gene, however, the precise genomic sequence is still not available. synteny-based isolation of genes conserved across cereal species is a common and effective way in map-based cloning of barley genes  <cit> . whereas, our in silico comparison showed that only  <dig> of the  <dig> morex_contigs on fp_contig_ <dig> and fp_contig_ <dig> could be anchored to the genome of brachypodium distachyon. nine and seven of these  <dig> morex_contigs were distributing on bd <dig> and bd <dig>  respectively . furthermore, as for the two morex_contigs surrounded the hvsgra gene, morex_contig_ <dig> was anchored to bd <dig> of brachypodium distachyon, and we couldn’t find any homolog contigs for morex_contig_ <dig>  the similar result was also observed in rice. this hindered us from getting a precise physical order of these morex_contigs in the chromosome region containing the hvsgra gene. so all of the genes in fp_contig_ <dig> and fp_contig_ <dig> with high confidence were extracted from the popseq barley map  <cit> . finally, six genes were identified as candidate gene for hvsgra , including four genes with known function, namely cytochrome p <dig>  fructokinase-1-like , laccase. out of these genes, cytochrome p <dig>  <cit>  and fructokinase   <cit>  have been reported to be associated with albino in plant. our further analysis showed that one base’s substation of c to a in the third exon of hvflns gene generated a premature stop codon in whs <dig> . the lack of atp binding site of hvfln <dig> in whs <dig>  which is essential for the kinase activity, may lead to loss of function of this gene. frk is a kind of kinase that primarily phosphorylates fructose in carbohydrate metabolism, which is involved in many developmental and physiological processes of plant  <cit> . except for frks, there is still a kind of members called flns in plants . these flns were distinctly grouped for a new branch during the homology analysis , suggesting that they may play different roles in plant as compared to frks. however, these flns were quite conserved among different species, especially the c terminal of these proteins. the hvfln <dig> identified in our study showed high level of similarity to atfln <dig> and atfln <dig> of arabidopsis, respectively . the most recent investigations showed that the mutation of atfln <dig> or atfln <dig> in arabidopsis displayed a pale-yellow or albino cotyledons phenotype and were seedling lethal on ms medium without sucrose, and only could survive on sucrose-containing medium  <cit> . the high similarity between the barley gene and its counterparts of arabidopsis suggested that they may play a similar role in developmental and physiological processes of plant. and further functional validation of the candidate gene, such as knock out or functional complementation, was also needed to confirm the role of hvfln <dig> in the green-revertible albino phenotype of barley. illustrating the molecular mechanisms of this interesting phenomenon will also help us to understand it well, which will be helpful for further use of the gene and the trait in future.

CONCLUSIONS
ssr assay and slaf-seq in conjunction with bsa were conducted to map a gene controlling the stage green-revertible albino in barley. the hvsgra gene was mapped between two adjacent fp contigs of barley. substitution of c to a in the third exon of fructokinase-1-like gene in whs <dig> may be responsible for the stage green-revertible trait of barley. the current study will lay the foundation for hierarchical map-based cloning of the hvsgra gene and utilizing the gene or the trait in the molecular breeding of barley in the future.
