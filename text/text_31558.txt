BACKGROUND
microarray techniques have revolutionized genomic research by making it possible to monitor the expression of thousands of genes in parallel. as the amount of microarray data being produced is increasing at an exponential rate, there is a great demand for efficient and effective expression data analysis tools. the gene expression profile of a cell determines its phenotype and responses to the environment. these responses include its responses towards environmental factors, drugs and therapies. gene expression patterns can be determined by measuring the quantity of the end product, protein, or the mrna template used to synthesize the protein. comparison of gene expression profiles in patients against their normal counterpart people will enhance our understanding of a disease and identify leads for therapeutic intervention. several important breakthroughs and progress in the gene expression profiling of diseases have been made  <cit> . more interestingly, researchers have identified many genes that play important roles in the onset, development, and progression of various diseases. identification of these disease genes offers a route to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, a necessary prerequisite for the rational development of improved preventative and therapeutic methods.

one effective approach of identifying genes that are associated with a disease is to measure the divergence of two sets of values of gene expression. a motivating example is shown in table  <dig>  which records the microarray gene expression values of five genes for two groups of people that are related to diabetes  <cit> : five insulin-sensitive  humans and five insulin-resistant  humans. in order to identify the genes that are associated with diabetes, one needs to determine for each gene whether or not the two sets of expression values are significantly different from each other. the two most popular methods to measure the divergence of two sets of values are t-test  <cit>  and wilcoxon rank sum test  <cit> , the statistical method t-test assesses whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other. given two sets s <dig> and s <dig>  the t-value is calculated as



where μs and σs are the sample mean and standard deviation of s, respectively.

the limitation of t-test is that it cannot distinguish two sets with close means even though the two sets are significantly different from each other. another limitation of t-test is that it is very sensitive to extreme values.

another popular statistical method is wilcoxon rank sum test, which can be used to test the null hypothesis that two sets s <dig> and s <dig> have the same distribution. we first merge the data from these two sets and rank the values from the lowest to the highest with all sequences of ties being assigned an average rank. the wilcoxon test statistic w is the sum of the ranks from set s <dig>  assuming that the two sets have the same continuous distribution , then w has a mean and standard deviation given by





where m = |s1| and n = |s2|.

we test the null hypothesis ho: no difference in distributions. a one-sided alternative is ha: s <dig> yields lower measurements. we use this alternative if we expect or see that w is unusually lower than its expected value μ. in this case, the p-value is given by a normal approximation. we let n~n and compute the left-tail pr .

if we expect or see that w is much higher than its expected value, then we should use the alternative ha: first s <dig> yields higher measurements. in this case, the p-value is given by the right-tail pr. if the two sums of ranks from each set are close, then we could use a two-sided alternative ha: there is a difference in distributions. in this case, the p-value is given by twice the smallest tail value 2*pr, if w < μ; or 2*pr, if w > μ.

although rank sum test overcomes the limitation of t-test in sensitivity to extreme values, it is not sensitive to absolute values. this might be advantageous to some applications but not to others.

RESULTS
to validate our approach, first, we investigated the distribution of fm d-value on a set of synthetic datasets. second, we conducted experiments on a synthetic dataset to study the relationship between fm-test d-value and its empirical p-value. third, on another synthetic dataset, we studied the relationship between fm d-value and the mean difference of distributions.

the probability distribution of fm d-value
suppose two sets s <dig> and s <dig> are randomly drawn from the same normal distribution, what is the probability distribution of fm d-value? to answer this question, we conducted the following simulation:

 <dig>  we generated n =  <dig> pairs of sets of values, with each set containing  <dig> values. as shown in figure  <dig>  each value in the two data sets is randomly generated from the same normal distribution n.

 <dig>  we calculated the d-value for each pair of sets.

 <dig>  we then estimated the probability density value  where δ =  <dig> . the value is essentially the fraction of the fm d-values falling in region  divided by the region length 2δ. the probability density function of the d-distribution was drawn in figure  <dig> 

 <dig>  at the end, in order to understand the effect of the number of pairs used for simulation, i.e., the size of the dataset, on the approximation error of the d-distribution, we generated datasets with different data sizes. for each data size, we generated  <dig> datasets, and thus derived  <dig> probability density functions. the maximum standard deviation for all d-values is recorded as the error rate for that data size. as shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, the error rate decreases as the size of the dataset increases.

from figure  <dig>  we can see that most fm d-values fall into the range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and very few fall into the range greater than  <dig> , or less than  <dig> . in particular, when d ≥  <dig> , p-value ≤  <dig> . this is reflected in the red-shared area in figure  <dig> with fdx =  <dig> . therefore, given two sets s <dig> and s <dig> drawn from the same normal unit distribution, the chance that the pair has a fm d-value equal to or greater than  <dig>  is very low. on the other hand, if we observe that two sets have a d-value equal to or greater than  <dig> , then this is strong evidence that these two sets are drawn from two different distributions. therefore, they should be considered as significantly divergent.

relationship between fm d-value and its empirical p-value
suppose two sets s <dig> and s <dig> are drawn from the same normal distribution, what is the probability that they have a fm d-value equal to or greater than a particular d? if the d increases, will this probability decrease? to answer these questions, we studied the relationship between fm d-value and empirical p-value as follows:

 <dig>  based on the above experimental result, we know that we need at least  <dig> pairs of sets to obtain a reliable empirical p-value. therefore, in this experiment, we generated  <dig> pairs of sets of values, with each set containing  <dig> values. each value is randomly generated from the unit normal distribution n.

 <dig>  we calculated the d-value for each pair of sets.

 <dig>  for each pair of sets s <dig> and s <dig> with d-value d, we calculated its empirical p-value as n+1/ <dig> where n is the number of pairs in these  <dig> pairs that have a d-value equal to or greater than d.

 <dig>  we drew the relationship between d-value and empirical p-value in figure  <dig> 

from figure  <dig>  we can see that as d-value increases, the p-value decreases. in particular, when d ≥  <dig> , we have p-value ≤  <dig> .

relationship between fm d-value and the mean difference of distributions
suppose two sets s <dig> and s <dig> are drawn from two different distributions, then a good divergence measurement should satisfy the following property: the less overlap between these two distributions, the greater the d-value. we validated that our fm-test has this property as follows:

 <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  two data sets are generated from two distributions. let n and n be two normal distributions, where x is the mean difference between these two distributions. in this experiment, we consider x =  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> , respectively.

 <dig>  we generated  <dig> pairs of sets of values, with the first set containing  <dig> values that are randomly generated from n, and the second set containing  <dig> values that are randomly generated from n.

 <dig>  we calculated the d-value for each pair. let the average of these  <dig> d-values be d. we then plotted  in figure  <dig> 

 <dig>  we repeated step  <dig> and  <dig> for different x. finally, the curve was drawn in figure  <dig> 

discussion
analyzing diabetes data with fm-test
a diabetes dataset of microarray gene expression for a total of  <dig> genes downloadable from  <cit>  is used for analysis. for each gene, there are ten expression values, five from a group of insulin-sensitive  people and five from a group of insulin-resistant  people. only the genes that have no null expression values are included in this analysis. we also require that, for a gene to be included, at least five out of its ten expression values are greater than  <dig>  this eliminates the genes whose expression values are noisy and not reliable.

the results of fm-test are compared with the results of t-test and rank sum test. as we can seen in table  <dig> although the orders of ranking are different for different methods, all three methods identify these genes as significantly differentially expressed between the is and ir groups. furthermore,  <dig> worst ranked genes in fm-test shown in table  <dig> are also consistent with the result of the other two methods. however, gene u <dig> is identified by fm-test as the 21st ranked significant gene with p-value  <dig> . neither t-test  nor rank sum test  identifies this gene as significant.

to study the relevance of genes in insulin metabolism and diabetes, the  <dig> best ranked differentially regulated genes shown in table  <dig> were further searched in the published literature. human phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate 5-phosphatase homolog  was found to be differentially expressed in insulin resistance cases. over-expression of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase- <dig> ship <dig> has been shown to inhibit insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase  dependent signaling events. analysis of diabetic human subjects has revealed an association between ship <dig> gene polymorphism and type  <dig> diabetes mellitus. also knockout mouse studies have shown that ship <dig> is a significant therapeutic target for the treatment of type- <dig> diabetes as well as obesity  <cit> . csermely et al. reported that insulin mediates phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of nucleolar protein nucleolin  by stimulating casein kinase ii, and this may play a role in the simultaneous enhancement in rna efflux from isolated, intact cell nucle  <cit> . c-myc is an oncogene that codes for transcription factor myc that along with other binding partners such as max plays an important role widely studied in various physiological processes including tumor growth in different cancers. myc modulates the expression of hepatic genes and counteracts the obesity and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet in transgenic mice overexpressing c-myc in liver  <cit> .

max interactor protein, mxi <dig>  competes for max thus negatively regulates myc function and may play a role in insulin resistance. in the presence of glucose or glucose and insulin, leucine is utilized more efficiently as a precursor for lipid biosynthesis by adipose tissue. it has been shown that during the differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> fibroblasts to adipocytes, the rate of lipid biosynthesis from leucine increases at least 30-fold and the specific activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa lyase , the mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing the terminal reaction in the leucine degradation pathway, increases 4-fold during differentiation  <cit> . schottelndreier et al <cit>  have described a regulatory role of integrin alpha  <dig>  in ca2+ signaling, that is known to have a significant role in insulin resistance  <cit> .

hcgv gene product  is known to inhibit the activity of protein phosphatase- <dig>  which is involved in diverse signalling pathways including insulin signaling  <cit> . human ribosomal protein l <dig> plays a regulatory role in eukaryotic translation apparatus. it has been shown to be an autoantigen in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> . identification of this gene in our analysis and by  <cit>  suggests a possible role of this gene in insulin resistance. published reports on these genes indicate their roles in insulin signalling and warrant further investigations on their functions in insulin resistance cases. we further recommend genes d <dig>  m <dig> and u <dig> as candidate genes for future research in this area.

in order to compare the fold change of expression levels between the is and ir groups to the statistical significance p-values, we presented all the genes in the diabetes dataset with a volcano plot shown in figure  <dig>  the volcano plot arranges the genes along dimensions of biological and statistical significance. the x axis is the fold change between the two groups, which is on a log scale log <dig>  where  is the mean of expressions in the is group, and  is the mean of the expressions in the ir group. in this way, up and down regulation appear symmetric. the y axis represents the p-value for our fm-test, which is on a negative log scale log <dig>  so that smaller p-values appear higher up. the x axis indicates biological impact of the change; the y axis indicates the statistical evidence, or reliability of the change.

as shown in figure  <dig>  gene u <dig> is identified by fm-test as the most statistically significant gene and it is over-expressed in the ir group; gene x <dig> is identified by fm-test as the 7th statistically significant gene and it is over-expressed in the is group. although genes m <dig>  d <dig>  m <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  and x <dig> have been identified by fm-test among the top ten significant genes, they are not over-expressed in either groups. finally, gene u <dig> is identified by fm-test as the 11th significant gene and it is over-expressed in the is group.

in summary, out of the top  <dig> genes identified by fm-test, we could find  <dig> of them in the literature about their association with insulin metabolism and diabetes. among the remaining four genes, gene x <dig> has been recommended by  <cit>  as a candidate gene for diabetes, we recommend that gene d <dig>  m <dig> and u <dig> could serve as candidate genes for future research in this area.

analyzing lung cancer data with fm-test
to study the relevance of significant genes in lung cancer, a dataset of microarray gene expression for a total of  <dig> genes downloadable from  <cit>  is used for analysis, the top ranked genes were further searched in the published literature. most of the genes we found have a validated role in tumor progression. as showed in table  <dig>  we discuss a few genes that we ranked best using our method. multiple identifiers of keratins were ranked significant in the dataset. cytokeratins are a polygenic family of insoluble proteins and have been proposed as potentially useful markers of differentiation in various malignancies including lung cancers  <cit> . dystonin  is a member of plakin protein family of adhesion junction plaque proteins. a recent study showed the expression of bpag1in epithelial tumor cells  <cit> . maspin  was has been shown to be involved in both tumor growth and metastasis such as cell invasion, angiogenesis, and more recently apoptosis  <cit> . tumor protein p73-like  is implicated in the activation of cell survival and antiapoptotic genes  <cit>  and has been used as a marker for lung cancer. it has been suggested that the p <dig> genomic amplification has an early role in lung tumorigenesis  <cit> . clca <dig> belongs to calcium sensitive chloride conductance protein family and has been used in a multigene detection assay for non small cell lung cancer   <cit> . plakophilins  are members of the armadillo multigene family that function in cell adhesion and signal transduction, and also play a central role in tumorigenesis  <cit> . desmoplakin  is a desmosome protein that anchors intermediate filaments to desmosomal plaques. microscopic analysis with fluorescence-labeled antibodies for dsp revealed high expression of membrane dsp in squamous cell carcinomas   <cit> . the data analysis also identified cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cdc <dig> and cyclin b <dig>  overexpression of cdc <dig> has been shown to be associated with premature anaphase promotion, resulting in mitotic abnormalities in oral scc cell lines  <cit> . mini chromosome maintenance <dig>  protein is involved in the initiation of dna replication and is marker for proliferating cells  <cit> . our analysis also identified gpr <dig>  and ugt1a <dig> . role of g protein coupled receptors are well documented in lung cancer and gpr <dig> could be an important gene in cancer progression. among overexpressed genes, we suggest nm_ <dig> and nm_ <dig> as potential candidates for biological investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we proposed an innovative approach based on the fuzzy set theory, fm-test, that quantifies the divergence of two sets directly. we have validated fm-test on synthetic datasets and show that it is effective and robust. we also applied fm-test to a real diabetes dataset and a cancer dataset. for each dataset, we identified  <dig> significant genes. within  <dig> significant genes in diabetes dataset, six of them have been confirmed to be associated with insulin signalling and/or diabetes in the literature, one has been recommended by others, the remaining three genes, d <dig>  m <dig> and u <dig>  are suggested as three potential diabetes genes involved in insulin resistance for further biological investigation. out of the  <dig> significantly overexpressed genes identified in the lung cancer data eight are confirmed by literature to be related to lung cancer. the remaining two genes nm_ <dig> and nm_ <dig> are potential candidates for further biological investigation. in addition, we analyzed the asymptotic properties of the distribution of fm d-value and the equation to calculate its p-value. the analysis is presented in appendix. fm-test is implemented as a web-based application and can be accessed for free at .
