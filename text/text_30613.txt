BACKGROUND
protein kinases of the iκb kinase  family are known for their roles in innate immune response signaling pathways in both mammals and drosophila  <cit> . all mammalian ikks studied so far have roles in immune responses, but operate on different targets. ikks are multi-subunit complexes consisting of two catalytic subunits  and a structural component . ikkα and ikkβ were identified in a protein complex that phosphorylates iκb and targets it for degradation, thereby allowing the nuclear localization and activation of nf-κb transcription factors  <cit> . the isoforms ikkε and tank binding kinase  <dig> are required to for phosphrylation and activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor  <dig> in response to viral infection  <cit> . two members of the ikk family are known in drosophila, namely dmikkβ and ik <dig>  <cit> . dmikkβ performs similarly to the mammalian ikkα and participates in antibacterial innate immune response  <cit> . in contrast, ik <dig>  was shown to control actin and microtubule  organization in an nf-κb-independent pathway  <cit> .

recently it was reported that ik <dig> binds to drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis  <dig>  and accelerates its degradation in a kinase-dependent manner  <cit> . one of the nonapoptotic processes that ik <dig> regulates through the diap1/caspase pathway is assembly of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . in ik <dig> loss-of-function mutants, tracheal terminal cells, bristles, and the antenna arista laterals, all of which require accurate f-actin assembly for their polarized elongation, exhibited aberrantly branched morphology. these phenotypes were sensitive to a change in the dosage of diap <dig> and the caspase dronc without apparent change in cell viability  <cit> . in addition, over-expression of ik <dig> destabilized f-actin based structures. these results suggest that ik <dig> may act as a negative regulator of f-actin assembly, maintaining the fidelity of polarized elongation during cell morphogenesis by modulating the level of diap <dig> 

a different aspect of the ik <dig> role in cytoskeleton related processes is revealed through oogenesis studies. during oogenesis, ik <dig> is required in an nf-κb-independent process for localization of oskar and gurken mrnas  <cit> . as a result, females that lack ik <dig> in the germline produce embryos that are bicaudal, ranging from headless embryos to embryos with a duplicated abdomen in place of the head and thorax. they also exhibit a ventralized phenotype. abnormal mrna localization in ik <dig> mutant oocytes could be attributed to defects in the organization of mt minus-ends. in addition, ik <dig> mutant oocytes and mutant escaper adults have abnormalities in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . however, the regulatory target for ik <dig> in controlling the oocyte cytoskeleton is still unknown.

in a global two-hybrid screen, ik <dig> was found to interact with spindle-f    <cit> . our previous work has shown that this newly discovered protein, spn-f is part of a yet uncharacterized pathway leading to the organization of a distinct subset of mts in the drosophila oocyte  <cit> . spn-f was first identified as a maternal effect mutation that affects the dorsal-ventral polarity of the eggshell  <cit> . the asymmetric distribution of maternal determinants  in the oocyte was analyzed, and it was found that spn-f, like ik <dig>  is required for proper localization of gurken during oogenesis. in addition to the maternal effect, spn-f, like ik <dig>  also affects the bristle morphology of the adult fly. moreover, in spn-f mutants, α-tubulin is abnormally associated with the oocyte nuclear periphery, and green fluorescent protein -tau fusion protein accumulates abnormally around the oocyte nucleus. spn-f was cloned and found to encode a novel coiled-coil protein, which co-localizes specifically to oocyte cortex regions, where the minus ends of mts reside, and also occurs in a punctate granular pattern in the nurse cells  <cit> . thus, earlier work show that spn-f affects oocyte axis determination and the organization of a subset of mts during drosophila oogenesis.

since ik <dig> mutants share many phenotypes with spn-f, including a very similar bristle phenotype, ventralized eggshells, and specific effects on mt organization in oogenesis  <cit> , we decided to study the nature of the interaction between these two proteins. we show that ik <dig> directly interacts with spn-f and that the c-terminus of spn-f is crucial for this interaction. we also demonstrate that ik <dig> is capable of phosphorylating spn-f, but that such phosphorylation is not essential for their interaction and also does not lead to spn-f degradation. we find that ik <dig> and spn-f co-localize to the anterior ring of the oocyte and in a punctate structure in the nurse cells. furthermore, we show that spn-f and ik <dig> are mutually required for this localization. we therefore conclude that ik <dig> and spn-f form a complex that regulates cytoskeleton organization during drosophila oogenesis. our finding that phosphorylation of spn-f by ik <dig> has no effect on spn-f protein degradation, contrary to the degradation seen in the case of diap <dig>  demonstrates a new mode of action for ik <dig> in the germline.

RESULTS
spn-f interacts physically with ik2
in a yeast two-hybrid-based protein-interaction map of the fly proteome, several proteins were found to interact with spn-f, among them ik <dig> kinase  <cit> . to further verify the yeast two-hybrid interaction, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation  assay in schneider  cells. extracts from s <dig> cells co-expressing gfp-tagged ik <dig> and hemagglutinin -tagged spn-f were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against gfp and immunoblotted with antibodies against ha. our results demonstrated that it is possible to co-precipitate ik <dig> together with spn-f , indicating that spn-f interacts with ik <dig>  in agreement with the findings of the yeast two-hybrid assay. next we sought to establish whether spn-f and ik <dig> also interact physically in the germline. for that purpose we expressed ha::spn-f along gfp::ik <dig> in the germline using the uas/gal <dig> system. gfp::ik <dig> was immunoprecipitated from ovarian extract, and the presence of spn-f was studied by western blot with antibodies against ha . similarly to our results in s <dig> cells, we were able to show that spn-f is found in a complex with ik <dig> in the oocyte as well .

the c-terminus of spn-f is crucial for the interaction with ik2
spn-f protein is predicted to have two coiled-coil domains . the first domain extends from amino acid  <dig> to amino acid  <dig> and the second from amino acid  <dig> to amino acid  <dig> . in order to determine which domain is important for the interaction with ik <dig>  we fused the n-terminal part of spn-f  and the c-terminal  of spn-f to gfp. we co-expressed myc-tagged ik <dig> with each of the gfp-tagged truncated proteins in s <dig> cells. extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp, and immunoblotting was done using anti-myc. myc tagged ik <dig> was co-precipitated with the c-terminus of spn-f but not with the n-terminus of spn-f . these results suggest that the c-terminus of spn-f is crucial for the interaction with ik <dig> 

spn-f and ik <dig> are co-localized in punctate structures in s2r+
having established that spn-f interacts physically with ik <dig> using co-ip in s <dig> cells, we decided to confirm the localization pattern of these proteins in s2r+ cells. expression of cherry-tagged spn-f revealed that the protein is found in cytoplasmic punctate structures , whereas expression of gfp-tagged ik <dig> alone showed an even distribution in the cell cytoplasm . the same localization pattern for ik <dig> was reported by  <cit> . when we co-expressed gfp-ik <dig> together with cherry-spn-f in s2r+ cells, we found that spn-f and ik <dig> are co-localized to the same cytoplasmic punctate structures . these results, together with our co-ip findings, indicate that co-expression of both proteins is required for co-localization to the same vesicles in s2r+ cells.

biomolecular interaction analysis of spn-f and ik <dig> complex
to test whether the interaction between spn-f and ik <dig> protein was direct and also to enable biomolecular interaction analysis of spn-f with ik <dig>  we used the multichannel proteon system . this method allowed us to collect kinetic data for six different concentrations of analyte at the same time  <cit> . fig. 3a shows representative sensorgrams for binding of spn-f in six concentrations to ik <dig>  the results revealed dose-dependent formation of this complex. in order to verify specific binding of spn-f to ik <dig> as opposed to binding to maltose binding protein , we examined the binding of spn-f to a different mbp-fused protein, namely sec13-mbp . these results show that there is no binding of spn-f to sec13-mbp, indicating that the spn-f binding to ik <dig> is specific. the data were globally fitted to the simple 1: <dig> interaction model with χ <dig> of  <dig> . the association and dissociation rate constants are ka =  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> s- <dig> and kd =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> s- <dig>  respectively. the kd equilibrium dissociation constant, which is derived from kd = kd/ka, was found to be  <dig>  nm. many examples of protein-protein interaction with affinities in the nanomolar to molar range have been described. for example, the kd value of complex formation between egf and egf receptor is  <dig> nm  <cit> . affinity values in the range of  <dig> – <dig> nm were observed in antibody/antigen complexes from hybridoma culture supernatants  <cit> . kd of  <dig>  μm was measured between amp-activated protein kinase  and rat acetyl-coa carboxylase- <dig>   <cit> . the affinity between spn-f and ik <dig> falls in the nanomolar range indicating a stable complex formation resembling that of antibody-antigen complexes.

ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f
since ik <dig> is a serine/threonine kinase and binds to spn-f protein, we investigated whether ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f protein. s <dig> cells were co-transfected with ik <dig> and spn-f or spn-f alone. extracts were subjected to sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and spn-f protein migration on gel was analyzed by western blot with an anti-spn-f antibody. in cells co-expressing spn-f and ik <dig>  we found a reduction in the mobility of spn-f protein  as compared with its migration when expressed alone . this reduced mobility of spn-f could be mitigated by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase , strongly suggesting that ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f. to confirm these results, we performed an in vitro phosphorylation kinase assay. gfp-tagged ik <dig> was immunoprecipitated from s <dig> cells. we studied the ability of this immunoprecipitate to phosphorylate purified his-tagged spn-f protein. we found that besides the autophosphorylation of gfp-ik <dig> protein, there was another 32p-labeled protein band at ~ <dig> kd, which corresponds to the mass of his-tagged spn-f . taken together with the shift in mobility, the latter result demonstrates that ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f.

the interaction between spn-f and ik <dig> does not depend on phosphorylation
it was recently shown that ik <dig> phosphorylates and interacts with diap <dig>  the interaction between diap <dig> and ik <dig> was not dependent on phosphorylation  <cit> . accordingly we proceeded to test the ability of spn-f to interact with a kinase dead form of ik <dig>  ik <dig> k41a  <cit> . western blot analysis showed that the mobility of spn-f when expressed with ik <dig> k41a was similar to the migration of spn-f when expressed alone, proving that the kinase domain of ik <dig> is inactivated in the mutant . although spn-f was not phosphorylated by ik <dig> k41a, a specific interaction between the proteins did take place , indicating that the interaction between ik <dig> and spn-f proteins does not depend on phosphorylation.

ik <dig> does not promote spn-f degradation
it was recently reported that ik <dig> promotes degradation of diap <dig> through direct phosphorylation  <cit> . since ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f in s2r+ cells, we examined whether such phosphorylation of spn-f leads to its degradation. s2r+ cells were co-transfected with gfp-tagged spn-f and increasing amounts of gfp-tagged ik <dig>  cell extracts were subjected to western blot analysis with anti-gfp. we found that while expression of different levels of gfp-ik <dig> did lead to spn-f phosphorylation, as revealed by the change in spn-f mobility, this phosphorylation did not lead to its degradation . to determine whether ik <dig> influences the stability of spn-f in flies, we tested the stability of spn-f in the germline while over-expressing gfp::ik <dig>  for that purpose we generated transgenic flies expressing gfp::spn-f together with gfp::ik <dig>  then tested the level of spn-f protein relative to transgenic flies expressing gfp::spn-f or gfp alone. we demonstrated that expression of ik <dig> had no effect on spn-f protein stability in the germline , thus supporting our finding that ik <dig> does not promote spn-f degradation.

ik <dig> protein is co-localized with spn-f in punctate form in the nurse cells and at the anterior ring of the oocyte
in order to examine the localization of ik <dig>  transgenic flies expressing gfp-tagged ik <dig> were generated. expression of a gfp-tagged uasp-ik <dig> transgene under the direction of the ubiquitous actin-gal <dig> driver rescued both the viability and bristle abnormalities of ik <dig> allelic combinations completely . it has been reported that over-expression of ik <dig> promotes diap <dig> elimination and induces cell death in somatic tissues  <cit> . however, we found that flies over-expressing gfp-tagged ik <dig> or uas-ik <dig>  <cit>  in the germline are fertile and display no induction of apoptosis. we found that gfp-tagged ik <dig> is localized to the anterior end of the oocyte and is present in a punctate pattern in the nurse cells, similarly to the pattern found for spn-f . next, we decided to test whether the gfp-tagged ik <dig> co-localizes with endogenous spn-f protein. for that purpose, ovaries expressing gfp-tagged ik <dig> were immunostained with spn-f antibody. we observed that spn-f and ik <dig> were co-localized at the anterior ring of the oocyte and in the same punctate structures in the nurse cells .

ik <dig> and spn-f are reciprocally required for localization to the anterior ring in the oocyte and to the punctate pattern in nurse cells
having shown that ik <dig> and spn-f create a complex, we tested whether the proteins are mutually required for their correct localization. to determine whether spn-f localization depends on ik <dig>  we studied the localization of spn-f in ik <dig> mutants. because ik <dig> mutants are lethal, we used frt/flp recombination combined with the ovod dominant female-sterile mutation to generate mutant clones in the female germline  <cit> . we observed that in ik <dig> germline clones spn-f aggregates in the oocyte during early oogenesis and is no longer found in a tight posterior localization as in the wild type . during mid-oogenesis spn-f localization to the mt minus end is significantly reduced in ik <dig> germline clones as compared with wild-type egg chambers, and spn-f aggregates in the oocyte; there is also more punctate distribution of spn-f protein in the nurse cells  as compared with the wild type . we also analyzed gfp-ik <dig> localization in spn-f mutant ovaries and found that ik <dig> localization to the anterior ring of the oocyte was diminished . these results show that the proteins are mutually dependent for their correct localization.

discussion
recent studies implicate the drosophila ikkε homologue ik <dig> in seemingly unrelated nf-κb functions. it was shown that ik <dig> modulates caspases for a nonapoptotic function and controls both actin and mt cytoskeletons  <cit> , and also that it regulates the actin cytoskeleton through phosphorylation and degradation of diap <dig>  <cit> . moreover, it was reported that, in ik <dig> mutant oocytes, abnormal mrna localization can be attributed to defects in organization of mt minus-ends, giving rise to ventralized and bicaudal phenotypes of mutant embryos  <cit> . whereas the control of actin polymerization appears to be mediated by a nonapoptotic function of diap <dig>  the regulatory target of ik <dig> in controlling cytoskeleton organization in the oocyte is still unknown. in this study we examined whether spn-f, which showed precisely the same ovarian and bristle phenotypes as ik <dig> mutants, might be an ik <dig> target. in previous work we reported that spn-f encodes a novel protein that affects oocyte axis determination and the organization of mts during drosophila oogenesis  <cit> . in this work we show that ik <dig> physically interacts with spn-f and forms a relatively stable complex. in addition, we show that ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f but that the interaction between these two proteins is independent of phosphorylation. thus, our results suggest that spn-f is a putative regulatory substrate of ik <dig>  moreover, our results indicate that the nature of the interaction between spn-f and ik <dig> is different from that attributed to ik <dig> and diap <dig>  we showed that spn-f phosphorylation by ik <dig> had no effect on its stability in s <dig> cells. supporting this conclusion is the finding that over-expression of ik <dig> in the ovaries had no effect on spn-f stability or development , indicating that over-expression of ik <dig> does not lead to spn-f degradation. furthermore, the ovarian phenotype of spn-f mutant is similar to the ovarian phenotype of ik <dig>  <cit> . thus, whereas ik <dig> regulates organization of the actin cytoskeleton via phosphorylation and degradation of diap <dig>  in the oocyte, rather than affecting spn-f degradation, ik <dig> and spn-f form a complex that regulates the oocyte cytoskeleton.

how does the ik2/spn-f complex function in the germline? in this study, we showed that ik <dig> and spn-f are co-localized both to the anterior ring during mid-oogenesis and to punctate structures in the nurse cells. additionally, ik <dig> and spn-f are mutually required for correct localization in the germline. in ik <dig> germline clones, spn-f protein localization along the anterior cortex is significantly reduced relative to the wild-type egg chamber and spn-f aggregates in the oocyte; also, there is a higher accumulation of the punctate structures containing spn-f protein in the nurse cells as compared with the wild type. furthermore, we found that ik <dig> localization to the anterior end of the oocyte and to the punctate structure in the nurse cells depends on spn-f. thus, we suggest that the correct localization of spn-f and ik <dig> complex to special compartment within the oocyte is an essential requirement for organization of oocyte cytoskeleton. the defects observed in ik <dig> and spn-f mutants oocyte are most likely due to misslocalization of the ik2/spn-f complex.

immunostaining has shown that spn-f protein localizes to the minus end of the mt network in the oocyte and also to granules in the nurse cells. in our previous work we found that depolymerization of mt and mutations in dynein heavy chain cause a significant loss of spn-f localization at the oocyte anterior cortex  <cit> . in addition, these treatments results in substantial increase in both the number and the size of spn-f granules in the nurse cells. these observations suggest that spn-f is transported from the nurse cells to the oocyte and that this transport could be mediated by dynein. in the present study we found that when ik <dig> was expressed alone in s2r+ cells, it was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm whereas spn-f localized to cytoplasmic punctate structures. when both proteins were co-expressed in s2r+, ik <dig> was co-localized to the cytoplasmic punctate structures along with spn-f. moreover, we found a higher accumulation of punctate structures containing spn-f protein in the nurse cells in ik <dig> mutants as compared with the wild type, similarly to our observation in dynein heavy chain mutant. taking all of our results into account, we would like to propose that spn-f is required for localization of ik <dig> to cytoplasmic transport vesicles while ik <dig> is required for correct transport of the complex from nurse cells to oocyte. once the complexes are in the oocyte, they may accumulate at certain cortical sites where they promote the interaction of mts and the actin cytoskeleton.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that ik <dig> and spn-f form a complex which regulates cytoskeleton organization during drosophila oogenesis and in which spn-f is the direct regulatory target for ik <dig>  unlike other ikk proteins, ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f without promoting its degradation.
