BACKGROUND
cyathine and allocyathine were the first reported cyathane diterpenoids discovered by allbutt and ayer from a static liquid culture of the fungus cyathus helenae  in the early 1970s  <cit> . they were proven to be active against actinomycetes, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and some fungi, including dermatophytes. afterwards, various structurally related compounds, so-called cyathane type diterpenoids, were isolated from different basidiomycetous cultures, e.g. striatals and striatins from cyathus spp., sarcodonins from sarcodon spp., and erinacines from hericium spp.   <cit> . all of these compounds share a cyathane skeleton consisting of five-, six-, and seven membered rings and possess antibacterial, fungicidal, and cytotoxic properties. fungal extracts prepared from c. striatus showed significant inhibitory effects on the nf-κb activation pathway and might be applied for cancer therapeutics  <cit> . erinacines promote nerve growth factor  synthesis, which suggests the application of h. erinaceus or its secondary metabolites for the treatment and prevention of dementia and further neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .figure  <dig>

because of their interesting biological activities and their high potential in medicinal and pharmaceutical applications, cyathane diterpenoids have attracted increasing interest in recent years. at present, the most common method for analysis of cyathane diterpenoids is high performance liquid chromatography  coupled to diode array and mass spectrometric detection  <cit> .

as a rapid, sensitive and cost effective method, an elisa specific for cyathane type secondary fungal metabolites may serve as a complementary method, especially in screenings for new producer strains. in the present study, an indirect competitive elisa for the structure specific detection of cyathane type diterpenoids using polyclonal antibodies was developed, and its potential for the analysis of biological samples was proven.

RESULTS
optimum coating conditions
striatal b was chosen as coating hapten in elisa, because it is more polar than striatal a. in order to increase its solubility in aqueous solution, an equal volume of dmso was added to the buffers. the optimum coating conditions  were obtained by coating the plate in pbs/dmso  buffer. more intense signals were obtained by coating at 24°c or 37°c, compared to coating at 4°c. striatal b was adsorbed more efficiently by coating overnight than for  <dig> h. based on these results, the optimum coating conditions for striatal b are summarized as follows: pbs/dmso  buffer, and coating overnight at 24°c. the optimum concentration for coating of the hapten and the dilution of polyclonal antibodies  were determined by checkerboard titration to be  <dig> μg ml− <dig> and 1: <dig>  respectively, which were used in the following indirect competitive elisa experiments.

tolerance against organic solvents
due to the poor solubility of cyathane diterpenoids in aqueous solutions, the tolerance against organic solvents used to dissolve these compounds was tested for assay optimization. an addition of 5% dmso, acetonitrile or methanol, respectively, to the pre-incubation solution was found acceptable. methanol could be used up to 25% without a notable negative effect. high percentages of dmso up to 30% and of acetonitrile up to 20% resulted in considerable negative effects on the assay. an addition of dmso >30% or acetonitrile >20% showed a sudden increase of signals. since methanol reacts with striatals  <cit> , an addition of 5% dmso or acetonitrile was selected for pre-incubation in the following indirect competitive elisa.

assay precision
intra-assay and inter-assay precisions were determined for several concentrations of striatal b . the intra-assay precision was calculated from the extinction difference at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm within one microtiter plate. less than 10% cv were obtained in every experiment, indicating an acceptable precision. the inter-assay precision was obtained from %b/b0-values of  <dig> plates on different days. variations of less than 20% were observed. the average ic <dig> of striatal b standard was  <dig>  ng ml− <dig> with an inter-assay cv of  <dig> % .table  <dig>

recovery
to assess the assay accuracy, striatal b was added to the sample matrix in several concentrations, and the recoveries of the spiked samples were determined. in parallel, hplc-dad was used to analyze the spiked samples. the apparent recoveries of striatal b in the sample matrix as determined by indirect competitive elisa ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, while those obtained by hplc-dad varied from  <dig> % -  <dig> %. the limit of quantification was  <dig>  μg ml− <dig> for elisa, and  <dig>  μg ml− <dig> for hplc-dad. a good correlation between the striatal b concentrations measured by elisa and by hplc-dad  was observed .figure  <dig>

analysis of h. erinaceus
the indirect competitive elisa was applied to samples prepared from submerged cultures as well as from fruiting bodies of h. erinaceus. the total concentrations of cyathane diterpenoids in supernatants and in extracts thereof are displayed in figure  <dig>  a similar change of %b/b0-values was observed in both cases during the  <dig> culture days. %b/b0-values in extracts of fruiting bodies from h. erinaceus were near to 100% and were independent from the sample concentration in the assay.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, striatal b was directly attached as a low molecular weight hapten to microtiter plates. in many studies the use of protein conjugated haptens for immobilization was reported  <cit> , as the ability of proteins to adsorb to the plastic surface of microtiter plates is much higher than that of low molecular weight haptens. however, the coupling ratio of haptens to carrier proteins may vary depending on the coupling reaction and a waste of valuable haptens during conjugate synthesis is often unavoidable. the involvement of carrier proteins results in several problems. firstly, it may cause unspecific binding to pabs and thus reduce specific signals. secondly, due to the large molecular dimension of carrier proteins, a shielding or masking effect may occur that impedes the binding of pabs to the conjugated haptens  <cit> . some researchers reported about pre-treatments of the plate surface, e.g. by uv irradiation or reagents in order to realize a direct binding of small molecules  <cit> . in the present study, the target analyte  was directly attached to microtiter plates without pre-treatment of the plate surface. significant differences between the various coating procedures were found during the study of coating conditions. the ph of the coating buffer significantly affected the coating efficiency. the final ph of the coating buffer pbs, potassium acetate and sodium carbonate after mixing with dmso was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. an influence of the ph on the coating efficiency has been reported in several publications  <cit> . in addition, a decomposition of striatal b was detected in potassium acetate buffer in a time course study by hplc analysis . that might be a reason for the poor attachment of striatal b to the plate in this buffer system. for striatal b, coating at ph  <dig>  was more efficient than at ph  <dig> .

the presence of organic solvents may influence the performance of an elisa. methanol caused the least negative effect, and the use of low concentrations of acetonitrile or dmso was also acceptable. similar results have been reported e.g. by  <cit> . the tolerance against organic solvents allows for the analysis of samples from fungal cultures which require extraction with an organic solvent. the sudden increase of the signals in the presence of acetonitrile and dmso in high concentrations indicated a false positive signal possibly caused by denaturation of the antibodies and thus an unspecific adsorption to the blocking proteins.

all of the examined cyathane diterpenoids showed cross reactivities against striatal b. as expected, striatin b with ic50 =  <dig> % showed the highest cross reactivity. striatin b and striatal b differ only in the aldehyde group at the c <dig> ring, and this position of striatal b was used for bsa-conjugate synthesis for immunization. therefore, striatin b and striatal b possess the same antigenic determinants. erinacine p showed the lowest cross reactivity with ic50 =  <dig> %. based on the cross reactivities and molecular structures it might be suspected that the resulting antiserum displays the highest affinity toward the cyathane ring moiety.

the recovery experiments suggested that the developed elisa is accurate and significantly more sensitive than the hplc-dad method. it could be used for the estimation of the total cyathane diterpenoid concentrations of biological samples. the assay showed interferences with constituents of the culture media of h. erinaceus, as a matrix effect was observed with the control samples . therefore, the use of organic extracts is preferred for the analysis of cyathane type diterpenoids in fungal culture supernatants. the product concentrations could be estimated during the cultivation period. however, the total concentrations represent the sum of all compounds showing cross reactivity against striatal b. they may thus differ from the individual concentrations determined by hplc.

no significant interferences  were observed with crude extracts of fruiting bodies of h. erinaceus. therefore, the secondary metabolites present in the fruiting bodies, e.g. hericenone and erinacerine, did not cross react with the polyclonal antibodies. these results are in good agreement with a review article about secondary metabolites from h. erinaceus  <cit> . up to date, erinacines have been mostly reported from submerged cultures of h. erinaceus, and only traces of erinacines have been found in fruiting bodies  <cit> . in the present study, the trace concentrations of erinacines in the fruiting bodies were apparently below the detection limit of the elisa.

the cv% values for the inter-assay precision might be caused by many factors, e.g. the position of the wells in the plate , the day to day variation in reagent preparation, the temperature of buffers, the variability in washing procedures, pipetting errors and the loss of enzyme activity of the secondary antibodies after prolonged storage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
polyclonal antibodies against striatal a/b were produced, and an indirect competitive elisa was developed for determination of striatal b and structural related compounds. the method has shown satisfactory results concerning specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. the application to samples from submerged cultures and fruiting bodies of h. erinaceus indicated that the elisa may be used for the estimation of total cyathane diterpenoid concentrations in complex mixtures. due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it represents an ideal screening tool for discovering new potential producers of cyathane type diterpenoids. further optimization will be needed to improve the inter-assay precision.
