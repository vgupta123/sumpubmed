BACKGROUND
gene expression is ultimately controlled by the dna sequence of the genome. the dramatically different dna composition of proximal promoters in mammals  <cit>  compared to yeast  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit>  suggests that different mechanisms regulate gene expression in those organisms. proximal promoters in yeast and drosophila are at rich and tend to be poorly-bound by nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo <cit>  allowing easy access for transcription factors . in contrast, vertebrate promoters are often gc rich  <cit>  and are well bound by nucleosomes in vitro <cit> . in vivo, however, the gc rich promoters are instead bound by transcription factors and rna polymerase ii  <cit> . this observation lends support to a dynamic equilibrium switch mechanism where the promoter shifts from being bound by a nucleosome to being bound by tfs  <cit> . the kinetic interplay between these two states is mediated by the chromatin remodeling factors that disrupt, unwrap, and/or displace nucleosomes  <cit> . an extension of this competition model is a collaborative competition model where two tfs can bind to dna independently but together can cooperate and displace a nucleosome if the two tfbss are within 150-bps of each other  <cit> . the mechanistic details of this switch are complex with some tf being able to bind to dna also bound by the histone octamer  <cit> .

the determination of the in vitro binding of chicken nucleosomes to yeast genomic dna allowed development of a scoring system that give an intrinsic nucleosome occupancy score  that indicates how well a nucleosome would bind any 150-bps of dna  <cit> . this scoring system predicts that nucleosomes would bind cpg-rich regions well, which is consistent with what was observed  <cit>  indicates credibility to the accuracy of the calculation. a general conclusion is that nucleosomes preferentially bind cytosine and guanine, sequences that often occur in clusters called cpg islands in mammalian genomes  <cit> . hughes and colleagues have shown that in human samples, tf binding and dnase i hypersensitive sites  preferentially localize in genomic regions with high inos  <cit> .

in this study, we have focused on three tfs binding to their canonical tfbss: c-jun binding the ap- <dig> motif , glucocorticoid receptor  binding the gr-like split 8-mer   <cit> , and hoxa <dig> binding the homeobox pbx motif   <cit> . we show that nucleosomes are calculated to bind preferentially to both the gr and c-jun motifs revealing an inherent competition between nucleosome and tf for binding. in contrast, the hoxa <dig> motif is calculated to be less well bound by nucleosomes suggesting they are not in competition for binding the canonical motif  <cit> . some hoxa <dig> and gr, but not c-jun, bound motifs have low inos suggesting a second class of motifs that are not in competition with nucleosomes and may function using different mechanisms.

we used a logistic regression to evaluate the significance of these correlative observations and determined how well inos and co-occurring dna motifs could predict if a canonical motif would be bound by a tf. high inos for canonical ap- <dig> motifs was a good predictor of c-jun binding but co-occurring sequences was not predictive. for gr, in contrast, inos was less predictive but co-occurring cis-motifs,  was more predictive.

RESULTS
gr and c-jun proteins preferentially bind canonical dna motifs in regions with high inoss
previous work has shown that dexamethasone induced gr protein binding preferentially occurs in dhs in the genome  <cit> . gr chip-seq data identified peaks for gr binding that were examined using meme  <cit> , dna motif finding tools, and presented a position weight matrix for the enriched gr motif and the co-occurring ap- <dig> motif. we have extended this analysis and examined all dna 8-mers in the form of the gr motif  termed a gr-like split 8-mer and calculated the enrichment of split-8-mers in gr peaks . two sequences , which occur  <dig>  and  <dig>  times in the masked genome, are the most enriched  split 8-mers in the gr peaks. to exclude repetitive parts of the genome, we focused on the masked genome comprising ~55% of the genome  <cit> . similar results are obtained when we examine the whole genome. the cg containing gr motif is not prominently seen in the published position weight matrix  <cit>  reflecting it is rare in the genome. the variable enrichment of distinct sequences reflects the importance of studying individual sequence motifs instead of position weight matrices  <cit> . we also determined the enrichment of all 8-mers in the ap-1-like form  in the  <dig>  c-jun peaks - the four most enriched 8-mers contained the canonical ap- <dig> 7-mer  . inos averages for gr peaks, c-jun peaks, and dhss spanning a  <dig> -bp region have a maximum at the center of the peak with widths of ~300-bps  as shown previously for other mammalian transcription factors  <cit> .

one way to evaluate how predictive high inos is in tf localization in the genome would be to calculate an inos for each nucleotide in the genome. however, to simplify the analysis, we calculated the inos for all canonical motifs and compared this to chip-seq data that identify bound canonical motifs. over half of the  <dig>  c-jun chip-seq peaks in mouse mammary  <dig> cells contain a canonical 7-bp ap- <dig> motif. the average inos across  <dig> -bps for the c-jun peaks with and without an ap- <dig> motif are similar . the bound ap- <dig> motifs have significantly higher inos values  compared to unbound motifs   . figure 1c presents a histogram summarizing inos distribution for all ap- <dig> motifs in the genome and the percentage in c-jun chip-seq peaks. c-jun preferentially binds ap- <dig> motifs with high inos, while only a few ap- <dig> motifs with low inos are bound.  <dig> % of canonical ap- <dig> motifs are bound by c-jun, while up to ~30% of ap- <dig> motifs with high inos  are bound by c-jun . to evaluate the significance of inos for determining c-jun binding to the ap- <dig> motif, we used a logistic regression. the percent of variance explained  and area under roc curve  by inos for c-jun binding canonical motifs are  <dig> % and  <dig>   indicating inos is predictive of c-jun binding. when we examine c-jun binding to non-ap- <dig> sequences, inos is less predictive .

modeling the c-jun binding to ap- <dig> motif , gr binding to gr motif , hoxa <dig> binding to pbx motif  were performed by the logistic regression using generalized linear models . pve percent of variance explained  = 1-. cv err. estimated 11-fold cross-validation prediction error, auc area under the roc curve. *the co-occurrence of 2nd motifs: the co-occurrence motif of ap- <dig> motif is gr motif , the co-occurrence of gr motif is ap- <dig> motif , the co-occurrence of pbx motif is gr-like 8-mer . the pves of inos and co-occurrence of 2nd motif for ap- <dig>  gr and pbx motif are shown in bold to highlight the difference between the motifs.

the inos for all canonical gr motifs  in the genome were also determined . like c-jun, both peak and background inos values are higher for the bound motifs than the unbound gr motifs   and have higher inos near the peak  compared to nearby . gr binds  <dig> % of the canonical gr motifs, and preferentially binds to motifs in the genomic regions with higher inoss . unlike c-jun, some gr motifs with low inos  are bound  which may be indicative of a non-competitive model for tf and nucleosome binding  <cit> . using the logistic regression, the pve and auc for inos in the peaks to gr binding are  <dig> % and  <dig> , much less than  <dig> % and  <dig>  for c-jun .

two additional inos parameters are predictive of gr and c-jun binding to canonical motifs
in addition to the inos calculated when the canonical motif is at the center of the nucleosome-sized 150-bp genomic region , we also examined the ‘background’ value of inos  as well as the ‘peak height’ or ‘relative peak’ value of inos   <cit>  <cit>  . additional file 1: table s3a characterizes ap- <dig> motifs based on ‘background’ and ‘relative peak’ values revealing how these parameters can predict which motifs will be bound by c-jun. for example,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  ap- <dig> motifs with “high” ‘background’ and ‘relative peaks’ values are bound by c-jun while zero of the  <dig>  ap- <dig> sites with “low” ‘background’ and ‘relative peaks’ values are bound. to extend the insights gained from averaging the inos for all motifs, we examined individual values of ‘relative peaks’. 77% of bound ap- <dig> motifs have higher inos near the motif  compared to adjacent dna sequences  while only 59% of unbound canonical ap- <dig> motifs have this trait . similar but less dramatic results are observed for gr localization to canonical gr motifs . 74% of canonical gr motifs have a higher inos near the motif  compared to background , while 66% of the unbound canonical gr motifs have this trait .

a logistic regression indicates that the percent of variance explained  and auc for ‘background’ inos for c-jun localization to the canonical motif are  <dig> % and  <dig> , while the pve and auc of ‘relative peaks’ inoss for c-jun binding are only  <dig> % and  <dig>  . the least predictive factor was the relative peak value, which was previously reported as supporting a collaborative competition model  <cit> . for c-jun binding to ap- <dig> canonical motifs, the combined pve and auc for these three parameters are  <dig> % and  <dig>  . for gr localization to canonical motifs, the pve and auc for background inoss are  <dig> % and  <dig>  but the pve and auc of relative peak inoss are only  <dig> % and  <dig>  with the pve and auc of all three parameters are  <dig> % and  <dig>  .

nucleosomes preferentially bind gr and ap- <dig> motifs but not the pbx motif
c-jun and to an extent gr, prefer to bind motifs embedded in 150-bp long nucleosome-sized regions with high inos, however the contribution of the tfbs itself to inos of the entire 150-bps remains unclear. to address this issue, for each motif, we calculated the inos for  <dig>  simulated random 150-bp dna sequences with 42% gc content as occurs in the mouse genome with the motif at the center. we examined all  <dig>  gr-like 8-mers  and ap-1-like 8-mers , as well as a control set where motifs at the center were also randomized . the canonical gr motif  has a higher score than the average inos or the control set  suggesting that nucleosomes preferentially bind the gr motif. when we examined continuous 8-mers, a distribution was observed with many classic motifs, including ap- <dig>  having higher inos than random, similar to what was observed for gr .

we next used the logistic regression to evaluate the contribution of the 150-bps without the tfbs to inos. to examine this, we maintained the dna sequences surrounding the motif and replaced the motif by random bases with gc content of 42%, and then calculated inos. excluding the tfbs from the calculation of inos decreases the pve of inoss from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and auc from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for c-jun localization indicating that both the ap- <dig> motif and additional sequences drive preferential nucleosome binding . similar results  were observed for gr motifs .

some tfbss, such as homeobox pbx  motif, have low inos  and thus are not competing with nucleosomes for binding in vivo . examining published hoxa <dig> chip-seq peaks from mouse secondary bronchial arches  <cit>  , we observed that motifs with both high and low inos were bound. we examined all  <dig>  occurrence of the pbx motif in the genome and calculated inoss for both the  <dig> bound and  <dig>  unbound pbx motifs . the bound tfbs with low inos suggest the homeobox protein is not in competition with nucleosomes for binding to dna as previously observed for tfs that bind yeast promoters  <cit> .

gr binding and open chromatin
we correlated gr binding with the presence of a dhs to better understand the relationship between tf binding, the presence of a canonical motif, and nucleosome remodeling. gr peaks were classified into three groups, i.e. 71% in pre-programmed dhss , 24% in re-programmed dhs , and the remaining 5% in the regions that are not dhss, which we term un-programmed dhs. gr motifs in all three groups have similar inos with the pre-programmed dhs having slightly higher values  9% of the gr peaks in pre-programmed dhss contain a canonical gr motif, 34% of gr peaks at re-programmed dhss contain a canonical gr motif, while 48% of gr peaks not in dhss contain a canonical gr motif , suggesting a canonical motif facilitates gr binding in chromatin . inclusion of the experimentally determined dhss to the logistic regression, increased the pve for c-jun and gr binding to  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, and increased auc to  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

effect of a-fos on gr binding to the gr motif and 1-bp variants depends on the presence of an ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps. gr chip-seq peaks are placed into three groups, pre-programmed, re-programmed, and un-programmed. column 1: gr motifs. column 2: # of occurrences of each motif in the genome. column 3: # of motifs bound by gr. in brackets is the % of peaks that contain the motif. column 4: % of peaks containing a gr motif containing an ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps. in brackets is the % of gr motifs contain an ap- <dig> motif that are bound by c-jun. column 5: % of gr motifs containing an ap- <dig> motif nearby that loses gr binding after inhibition of c-jun binding by the dominant negative a-fos. column 6: % of gr motifs without a nearby ap- <dig> motif that lose gr binding after inhibition of c-jun binding by the dominant negative a-fos.

to more clearly examine gr binding in the un-programmed peaks, we compared the sequencing tag-density of gr and c-jun binding, and the dhs signal within 3-kb of the peak . in the  <dig> un-programmed gr peaks, a clear signal for gr binding was observed yet there was a less signal for the dhs. in contrast to gr, more than 95% c-jun binding is at pre-programmed dhss. only  <dig> % of c-jun binding is in re-programmed dhss  and in all these cases, a clear signal of tag density is observed for c-jun, gr and dhs . 42% of c-jun peaks in re-programmed dhss have a canonical ap- <dig> motif and 93% are bound by gr suggesting these two proteins are acting together resulting in more open chromatin. 3% of c-jun peaks are in un-programmed dhss but little tag density is observed for either c-jun or dhss in contrast to the gr tag density at un-programmed peaks suggesting that gr has a higher propensity to bind in chromatin .

an alternative method to evaluate gr and c-jun binding is to compare normalized tag density within 150-bps for gr and c-jun peaks containing canonical motifs with dhs reads . we examined the ap- <dig> 8-mer  for a more accurate comparison with the gr motif 8-mer . the slope of c-jun reads against dhs reads at the non-dhs regions is much higher than for gr implying gr can bind to the non-dhs regions better than c-jun. visualization of tag-density profiles within the 3-kb upstream and downstream of the canonical gr motifs and ap- <dig> 8-mer  supports gr binding in non-dhs regions . x-ray crystal structures of gr  and ap- <dig>  proteins bound to their canonical dna motifs were overlaid with an x-ray structure of the histone octamer  bound to dna  using the program chimera  <cit>  to create a physical model of these proteins bound to the same dna. no physical clashes were observed when gr and the histone octomer bind the same dna as has been experimental shown  <cit> , while clashes are observed when both ap- <dig> and the histone octamer bind the same dna .

we next examined how the three classes of gr motifs at pre-, re-, and un-programmed dhss correlate with expression of nearby genes . gr peaks with canonical motifs at pre-programmed dhs tend to activate nearby genes  compared to canonical motifs in un-programmed dhs . in contrast, un-programmed peaks without a motif tend to be more activating  in comparison to the pre-programmed peaks .

clusters of identical tf motifs are better bound
to identify additional sequence properties besides inos that are predicative of tf binding to canonical motifs, we examined co-localization with the same sequence  or a second sequence. canonical motifs were placed into bins depending on the distance to the nearest canonical motif. additional file 1: figure s5a shows, for example, there are only ~ <dig> gr motifs with a second gr within 150-bps and 18% are bound by gr. this increase relative to the ~5% bound for a single gr motif may be because they are called as a single peak. in contrast, there are ~ <dig>  gr motifs that do not have nearest neighbor within  <dig> -bps and only 3% are bound . similarly, 18% of the ~ <dig>  ap- <dig> motifs that are within 150-bps of a second ap- <dig> motif are bound by c-jun . adding the clustering of gr motifs into the logistic regression increased the pve from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and auc from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

an ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps of a gr motif triples gr binding
previously, the ap- <dig> motif was shown to enrich in gr peaks  <cit> . to identify a second sequence enriched in gr peaks, we compared the enrichment of all gr-like split 8-mers  to continuous 8-mers  . the three most enriched continuous 8-mers are ap- <dig> canonical motifs .

the effect of the distance between ap- <dig> and gr motifs on gr binding was examined . in the masked genome, there is a decrease in the number of gr and ap- <dig> motif pairs as the distance between them increases from 0-bps to 900-bps . there are  <dig>  occurrences of an ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps of a gr motif in the genome, much higher than expected  calculated using in silico random sampling in the genome . when we examined gr chip-seq peaks, gr motifs with a nearby ap- <dig> motif are better bound, with a clear inflection at 150-bps. at shorter distance, there is no unique spacing between the two motifs implying no direct physical interaction between gr and c-jun  with gr and ap- <dig> motifs that are closer together being better bound . if the two motifs are between 150-bps to 900-bps, the observed occurrences in the genome and gr peaks is closer to expected occurrences. we also examined the co-occurrence of gr and ap- <dig> motifs in all dhs regions , and the similar results are observed . for gr motifs with an ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps, gr preferentially binds motifs with higher inos . the pve and auc by the co-occurrence of an ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps of a gr motif are  <dig> % and  <dig> , and the addition of inos to ap- <dig> co-occurrence increased the pve to  <dig> % and the auc to  <dig>  . there are  <dig> gr motifs with two or more ap- <dig> motifs within 150-bps in the genome and 28% of them are bound suggesting that the ap- <dig> motifs can act additively .

the enrichment of ap- <dig> motifs in gr peaks occurs primarily in pre-programmed gr peaks. 66% of the pre-programmed gr peaks  overlapped with c-jun peaks, 13% of the re-programmed gr peaks  overlapped with c-jun peaks, and only 1% of un-programmed gr peaks  co-occur with a c-jun peak . when examined from the c-jun perspective, 20% of the pre-programmed c-jun peaks  have a gr peak while 93% of re-programmed c-jun peaks co-occur with the gr peaks  suggesting a mechanism where c-jun promotes gr binding by creating new dhss, and only 13% of the un-programmed c-jun peaks co-occur with a gr peak  .

bound 1-bp variants of the gr motif are more enriched for ap- <dig> motifs than canonical gr motifs
several gr-like split 8-mers are enriched in gr peaks and the  <dig> most enriched sequences are 1-bp variants of the canonical gr motif. the occurrence of the gr canonical motif and its 1-bp variants in the pre-, re-, and un-programmed gr peaks  showed that the two canonical gr motifs and the 1-bp variants are more frequent in the re-programmed and un-programmed gr peaks than the pre-programmed gr peaks. for all 1-bp variants of gr motif in the genome, we determined what percent are bound by gr and if one or more ap- <dig> motifs was within 150-bps. relaxing the gr motif of g-aca---t/cgt-c by 1-bp decreased gr binding to less than 1% of all occurrences in the genome. however, the presence of ap- <dig> motifs within 150-bps to the 1-bp variants of gr motif increased gr binding by ~8-fold . taken together, ap- <dig> motifs contribute significantly to gr binding but preferentially to non-canonical gr motifs. similar to the canonical ap- <dig> motif, 1-bp variants of the ap- <dig> motif can contribute to gr binding . co-occurrences of ap- <dig> motif with 1-bp variants of gr motifs are always higher than those with the canonical gr motifs in the gr chip-seq peaks, although their binding intensity is lower than the canonical gr motifs . these data suggest a prominent role of ap- <dig> in creating dhs that subsequently facilitate gr binding to 1-bp gr variants in the pre-programmed dhs  <cit> .

co-occurring ap- <dig> motifs need c-jun binding for gr binding
the contribution of c-jun binding to gr binding was examined using a-fos, a dominant negative protein that heterodimerizes with c-jun and prevents dna binding  <cit> . the gr peaks with more than a 50% decrease in tag-density upon a-fos expression are considered c-jun dependent. for the pre-programmed motifs, a-fos expression inhibited 44% of gr binding to canonical gr motifs when there was an ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps but only 15% of gr binding to canonical gr motifs without a nearby canonical ap- <dig> motif. similar results were observed for all 1-bp variants of gr motifs . a-fos expression had similar effects on the re- and un-programmed gr peaks that contain a gr and ap- <dig> motif within 150-bps. the effect of a-fos was lower in the re- and un-programmed gr peaks without an ap- <dig> motif again supporting the observation that presence of nearby ap- <dig> motif helps create a dhs facilitating gr binding to the canonical and 1-bp variants of gr motifs.

gr binds different gr motifs in att- <dig> cells
in a mouse pituitary att- <dig> cell line, gr bound different canonical gr motifs that also have high inos , suggesting that this trait is a general principle regulating gr localization . the logistic regression analysis indicates that the pve and auc of inos in peaks for gr localization are  <dig> % and  <dig>  in att- <dig> cells . instead of co-occurrence with ap- <dig> motifs , gr co-occurred with the e-box motif  in att- <dig> cells  suggesting that the co-occurrence of a second tfbs might be a cell type dependent mechanism. the addition of nearby e-box motif to the logistic regression increased the pve for gr binding from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

discussion
the advent of the chip-seq technique  <cit>  has produced detailed maps of transcription factor binding in the genome. these data sets are often used to produce a position weight matrix for preferred binding sites. however, it is difficult to compare the properties of one tf with another. we have used a logistic regression to evaluate sequence properties near tfbs that are predicative of a tfbs being bound in vivo. we examined the inos of tfbs embedded in 150-bps of dna and the co-occurrence of a secondary motif. these descriptors are different for the three tfs examined, gr, c-jun, and hoxa <dig> binding the gr, ap- <dig> and pbx motifs respectively.

recent computational models for calculating the strength of the in vitro binding of a nucleosome to any 150-bp length of dna  <cit>  allows evaluation of the significance of this parameter to tf localization in the genome. many tfs bind in regions that have higher inoss than neighboring dna and are depleted for nucleosomes  <cit>  <cit>  suggesting a competition model of gene regulation  <cit> . we determined the inos for each canonical gr, ap- <dig>  and pbx motif in the genome and identified which ones were bound by examining chip-seq data for gr and c-jun. our analyses showed that both gr and c-jun bind preferentially to the canonical motifs predicted to be well bound by nucleosomes  lending support to the competition model of gene regulation  <cit>  that we were able to quantify using a logistic regression. these data indicate that high inos is more predictive of c-jun localization  than gr localization  with pbx showing little localization dependent on high inos . the greater value for c-jun localization to ap- <dig> motifs than gr binding to gr motifs suggest c-jun may be more involved in competitive interactions with nucleosomes, such as maintaining or creating dhs  <cit> . both gr and pbx binding motifs with low inos suggesting a second mode of function for these two proteins. the significance of these differences observed among gr, c-jun and hoxa <dig> using the logistic regression will become clearer as additional tfs are examined. more accurate models of sequence specific nucleosome binding will improve the accuracy of these predictions.

competition models for tf and nucleosome binding the same sequence have been extended to collaborative competition models where two tfs can bind to dna independently but on their own do not displace a nucleosome. however, cooperatively they displace a nucleosome if they are within 150-bps  <cit> . this switch mechanism is observed in mammalian genomes  <cit>  where regulatory regions  <cit>  are often cpg islands that are well bound by nucleosomes in vitro <cit>  but not in vivo. the mechanism for the switch is complex. for example, some tfs  can bind to a motif that is also bound by the histone octamer, while other tfs  can only bind to motif only when the histone octamer is not bound. additional cooperativity to the switch can be achieved with cooperative binding of tf to their tfbss  <cit> .

the ability of two tfs to compete with a nucleosome for binding suggests that they are within 150-bps of each other  <cit> . when we examine the entire genome, there are ~ <dig>  occurrences of gr and ap- <dig> motifs within 150-bps, compared to ~ <dig>  occurrences expected, indicating that co-occurring gr and ap- <dig> motifs are enriched in the genome. in the mammalian genome, the clustering of tfbs is always observed when the two tfbs contain a cg dinucleotide  <cit>  because of the presence of cpg islands in the genome. however, neither the abundant gr motif  nor the ap- <dig> motif contains a cg dinucleotide suggesting their preferential localization in the genome is independent from the clustering of tfbs containing cg. for the rare cg dinucleotide containing gr motif , the methylation status of the cg can regulate function adding a layer of complexity onto gr activity  <cit> .

the collaborative competition model allows a single tf to interact with different tf in different cell types producing multiple functions. this is consistent with the observations concerning gr co-localization with different dna motifs in the two cell types examined. in the mouse pituitary cell line att- <dig>  gr binds gr motifs that have high inos. but instead of being enriched in ap- <dig> motifs, gr binds canonical motifs enriched in the co-localizing e-box motif that are within 150-bps. gr binds preferentially to motifs with high inos in both  <dig> and att- <dig> cells. thus, the propensity to bind a nucleosome may be a general parameter in determining gr localization. however, the nucleosome may be displaced by different collaborative tfs in difference cells, suggest that nucleosome positioning can be cell-specific.

tfbs are often clustered in regulatory regions  <cit>  where low-affinity tfbss may play a role in assisting high-affinity motifs bind a tf to displace a nucleosome  <cit> . 83% of gr peaks and 42% of c-jun peaks do not contain canonical motifs. however, many 1-bp variants are enriched in gr and c-jun peaks, allowing us to survey the difference of collaborative competition for canonical and 1-bp variants. we observed that a canonical ap- <dig> motif facilitates gr binding to 1-bp variants  better than the two canonical gr motifs .

the intrinsic nucleosome occupancy is correlated with gc content, which implies that some tfbss with high gc content may be well bound by nucleosomes  <cit> , while others with low gc content may be not. both gr and ap- <dig> canonical motifs are calculated to be well bound by nucleosomes. the gr  and ap- <dig>  motifs have two pyrimidine-purine dinucleotides  separated by 5-bps. these sequences wrap well around a nucleosome, which may be the reason why nucleosomes are calculated to bind these sequences well  <cit> . besides gr and ap- <dig> motifs, many additional 8-mers, such as the cre  and ctcf motif  have a high inos, which indicates that many tfs bind to the same sequences calculated to be well-bound by the nucleosome and produce an intrinsic competition between tf and nucleosomes for binding the same dna. in contrast, some motifs, e.g., pbx  bound by hoxa <dig> are not well bound by nucleosomes suggesting they are not competing for binding to the same dna. hoxa <dig> chip-seq data showed binding to motifs with both high and low inos suggesting that this protein can function in two separate mechanisms. these results are consistent with what charoensawan et. al recently observed in yeast  <cit> .

examples of a non-competitive model for tf and nucleosome binding are observed in yeast. generally, yeast promoters are at-rich with lower nucleosome occupancy both in vitro and in vivo <cit> . a recent study showed that, in yeast the transcriptional activators with high intrinsic nucleosome binding properties might compete with nucleosomes, while the repressors are intrinsically less likely to compete with nucleosomes  <cit> . in yeast, tfs can recognize a specific regulatory region in the genome background to regulate gene expression, while in higher eukaryotes, such as human and mouse, tfbss must be clustered to achieve specificity and collaborate to compete with nucleosomes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have used a logistic regression to quantify the contribution of inos and co-occurring sequence to tf binding in the genome. this strategy will allow investigators to more richly compare the properties of different tfs. only ap- <dig> motifs with high inos were preferentially bound while gr and hoxa <dig> bound canonical motifs with both high and low inos suggesting these proteins can function using two mechanisms.
