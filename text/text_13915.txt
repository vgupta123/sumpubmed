BACKGROUND
dehydroepiandrosterone  is quantitatively the main steroid hormone -or prohormone  <cit> - produced by the adrenal glands in humans, and is secreted mainly as dhea-sulphate  <cit> . but in rodents this adrenal production is unclear  <cit> . in addition to its role as androgen  precursor  <cit> , dhea is a key neurosteroid  <cit> , antiglucocorticoid  <cit> , metabolic regulator and controller of hormone action  <cit> .

dhea is widely consumed as a drug for a wide range of expected therapeutic actions, including androgen synthesis  <cit> , improvement of degenerative diseases  <cit>  and the treatment of overweight and obesity  <cit> . the rapid absorption and disposal of oral dhea  <cit>  has generated a number of studies and patents focussed on the maintenance of plasma dhea levels within a therapeutic range in spite of its rapid metabolism/excretion.

there is a number of naturally occurring fatty acid esters of steroidal hormones, including dhea  <cit> , androgens  <cit> , estrogens  <cit> , and, especially, oleoyl-estrone  <cit> . their functions have not been fully elucidated; androgen and estrogen esters have been postulated as deep storage depot for the corresponding hormones  <cit> , and oleoyl-estrone is a ponderostat signal  <cit> . hormone esters of varied fatty acid moieties have been proposed as the chimaeric products of sterol acyl-transferases  <cit> . acyl-dhea functions are so far unknown, but a number of tissue esterases have been found to hydrolyse these esters  <cit> , including hormone-sensitive lipase  <cit>  and other high km wide-spectrum cell esterases  <cit> .

the oleic acid ester of dhea was previously synthesized by our group, and tested as a potential slimming drug  <cit> , following the finding of oleoyl-estrone, a powerful hormone eliciting the loss of body fat  <cit> . oleoyl-estrone and oleoyl-dhea are structurally similar, the main difference being the aromatic nature of the a ring in the estrone moiety of oleoyl-estrone. since orally administered oleoyl-estrone is largely taken up intact  <cit> , and is readily incorporated into the circulating lipoproteins  <cit> , largely bypassing the intestinal and liver esterases, we studied whether the oleic acid ester of dhea was also absorbed largely intact. this would result in the slow release of dhea in the bloodstream. as a consequence, the present study deals with the fate of oral oleoyl-dhea and the analysis of its absorption, breakup and disposal.

RESULTS
however, in both sexes, a difference was observed in the pattern of appearance of dhea-sulfate between the dhea and oleoyl-dhea gavages: in dhea rats, the 30-min data were higher than those at  <dig> h, whereas in those receiving oleoyl-dhea, the values were lower at  <dig> min than half hour later. this delay may be explained by the timing of oleoyl-dhea hydrolysis to dhea and its incorporation into dhea-sulfate.

in females, the peak of plasma radioactivity, at  <dig> h after gavage, was coincident with that of dhea sulfate, both label and the sulfate levels decaying rapidly, with low values from  <dig> h onwards. the presence of label at  <dig> h was maintained, albeit very low. in spite of the different systems of calculation, the similarity of the pattern and the closeness of the concentrations involved suggest that most of the label recovered in the first hours in plasma corresponds to dhea-sulfate at least in females. in males, plasma label dhea equivalents were higher than the corresponding levels of dhea-sulfate, irrespective of the gavage being dhea or oleoyl-dhea.

the distribution of label in plasma  fractions was practically identical for all four groups of animals. in general, a small and variable part of the label  in plasma was found in the intermediate tlc area, and may be attributed to dhea or to similarly soluble androgen- or estrogen-derived hormones. most of the label, however could be found in the hydrophilic zone, coherent with a large presence of dhea-sulfate, but may contain other hydrophilic esters  of estrogens or androgens. only a small fraction of the label could be found in the form of highly lipophilic compounds .

 <dig> no data were available for whole-body mass of subcutaneous wat.  <dig> epididymal fat in males and periovaric fat in females.  <dig> estimated as  <dig> % of lean body mass.

the data are the mean ± sem of  <dig> different animals. wat = white adipose tissue; bat = brown adipose tissue. statistical significance of the differences, 2-way anova; g = effect of "gavage", i.e. differences between oleoyl-dhea and dhea; s = effect of sex. paired-group differences between sex-groups : * = p < <dig> .

the distribution of nonesterified dhea-derived label in the same tissues showed, in general, a higher label content, but the distribution patterns between the tissues were similar to those obtained with oleoyl-dhea . the presence of lipophilic fractions in the tissues analysed followed, again, a pattern very close to that described for oleoyl-dhea.

the more marked differences in the distribution of label were found when comparing male and female rats. liver, heart and brain levels were similar for both genders; males showed higher accumulation of oleoyl-dhea-derived label in the kidneys, spleen and adrenal glands, while females accumulated more label in the adipose tissues. the pattern obtained from dhea gavages was similar: no gender differences in liver, kidneys, adrenal glands and heart, higher male levels in spleen and increased label presence in adipose tissues in females.

the intestinal oleoyl-dhea esterase activity at three different ph is shown in figure  <dig>  most of the esterase activity was concentrated in the small intestine, with relatively lower levels of activity in the jejunum, and much lower in the stomach and the caecum. the distal part of the intestine shows a esterase capability lower than that of its median part, especially at ph  <dig>  the patterns of esterase activity for male and female rats were fairly similar, both in activity and distribution along the digestive tract. the main differences  can be found in the relatively lower duodenum activity of males at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  and the higher large intestine esterase of males at ph  <dig> and females at ph  <dig>  these patterns are not consistent with the existence of a single esterase activity, and may be more easily justifiable with at least two different enzymes, one working at a more acidic ph and the other with maximal activity at ph  <dig> or beyond, both presenting different distribution patterns along the alimentary canal.

the liver oleoyl-dhea esterase activity was similar, but lower, to those of the intestine:  <dig> ±  <dig> pkat/g prot at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> pkat/g prot at ph  <dig> , and  <dig> ±  <dig> pkat/g prot at ph  <dig>  for males and  <dig> ±  <dig> pkat/g prot at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> pkat/g prot at ph  <dig> , and  <dig> ±  <dig> pkat/g prot at ph  <dig>  for females. the large mass of the liver and the obliged transit of the portal blood flow enhance its overall ability to break up the oleoyl-dhea not hydrolysed by the intestine.

pure pancreatic cholesterol esterase acts effectively hydrolysing oleoyl-dhea. the effects on the dhea and the cholesterol ester  were slightly different, with higher yields  in the breakup of cholesterol at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  but similar at ph  <dig>  in both cases, the presence of taurocholate was essential for the enzyme to work, and the presence of the inhibitor diethyl-umbeliferyl phosphate resulted in a deep inhibition of the esterase for both substrates, an effect more marked at ph  <dig>  the presence of taurocholate was also essential for the breakup of oleoyl-cholesterol by the intestinal homogenate. however, this same homogenate was able to hydrolyse a significant proportion of oleoyl-dhea in the absence of taurocholate; the proportion of substrate hydrolysed was not different in the absence of taurocholate than in its presence. the inhibition of the homogenate esterase by diethyl-umbeliferyl phosphate was as effective on this preparation as was for the pure enzyme.

discussion
the results obtained are consistent with a rapid absorption/hydrolysis of the oral oleoyl-dhea, since the appearance of label and dhea-sulfate in plasma is undistinguishable in dhea or oleoyl-dhea gavages. however, very shortly after gavage, plasma label was higher in dhea-treated rats; shortly afterwards, hydrolysis of oleoyl-dhea rapidly compensated this difference.

pancreatic cholesterol esterase effectively breaks up oleoyl-dhea as we have found with a purified hog pancreatic enzyme; its action will take place in the intestinal lumen, past the stomach, and depends on the presence of biliary taurocholate. the remaining oleoyl-dhea may be broken up by the intestinal wall  esterase that we have found, acting at a variety of phs, from the probably lysosomal activity at ph  <dig> to the lumen and intestinal cell phs range between  <dig> and  <dig>  further hydrolysis of the surviving molecules can proceed when crossing the liver. the consequences are: a very complete and effective hydrolysis of the ester, the immediate absorption of dhea and its rapid conversion into dhea-sulfate, which is the main form of dhea in plasma  <cit> . the excess hormone is probably eliminated via the liver and urine  as suggested by the distribution of label, in a way that after  <dig> h most of the label has been disposed of. this is also in agreement with the known rapid pharmacokinetics of dhea  <cit> .

intestinal oleoyl-dhea esterase activity follows a pattern similar to that described for dhea sulfotransferase in humans  <cit> ; this association may facilitate the swift transfer of label from the oleoyl-dhea nucleus into hydrophilic compounds . in rat liver, sulfotransferase activity has been found to be much higher in females than in males  <cit> ; the coincidence of this higher sulfate transfer ability of the female liver with the high plasma peaks of dhea sulfate, and the lack of gender differences in intestinal sulfotransferase  <cit> , hints at the liver as a main site for the gender-related transformation of the dhea liberated in the intestine into dhea sulfate,

the slow relative increase of label in the intermediate phase with time seems to indicate that a small part of the dhea nucleus ingested has found its way into steroidal hormones -via 3-hydroxy-reductase and aromatase- which are to be found in plasma and in several tissues such as the adrenals. the growing accumulation of label in the lipophilic phase, especially in wat and adrenals, suggests the conversion and storage of highly lipophilic esters, such as the product of dhea esterification  <cit>  in adrenal glands. the different level of incorporation of dhea nucleus-derived label in different wat sites agrees with their marked differences in steroidal hormone handling  <cit> .

the marked differences in label distribution between male and female rats can be traced to the purported different fate of physiological dhea. in males part of the dhea is converted to androgen  <cit> , and part continues up to estrone; in females, however, the androgen stage is more limited, with probably most of the dhea finding its way into estradiol and estrone  <cit> . since the pharmacokinetics of these hormones in males and females are also different, the final result is a marked sex-related difference in the final distribution of label, both in terms of absolute radioactivity accumulated and the fraction  bearing the label, consequence of the probably different molecular species into which the dhea nucleus has derived.

dhea fatty esters have been found in lipoproteins  <cit> . in any case, it is improbable that the highly lipophilic fraction of the label progressively appearing in serum will correspond to resynthesized oleoyl-dhea, since the proportion of label in this fraction increased only when practically no dhea label was present in serum. this hints at the labelled compound being a lipophilic form  of other steroidal molecular species ultimately derived from dhea. lipophilic steroidal hormone esters include androgens  <cit>  or oleoyl-estrone  <cit> , which may be recirculated within lipoproteins  <cit> , thus justifying the maintenance of the low persistent presence of label observed in plasma. since dhea provides the nuclear structure for the synthesis of both androgen and estrogen in most tissues  <cit> , and the steroid hormone acyl-ester found so far in highest concentrations in serum is oleoyl-estrone  <cit> , we can speculate that probably the rise in lipophilic label in serum with time may be mainly consequence of label transfer from the dhea load to the estrone ester.

in spite of the structural similitude with oleoyl-estrone, oleoyl-dhea was not significantly absorbed as such, and its presence in plasma during the peak absorption period was nil; this means that oleoyl-dhea was not incorporated into lipoproteins for safe passage from the splanchnic bed to the systemic circulation as occurs with oleoyl-estrone  <cit> .

the results presented suggest that hydrolysis of steroid acyl esters may take place in the intestinal lumen and be effected by a broad-spectrum acyl-cholesterol esterase  <cit> , but also that the intestinal wall contains other esterase different from cholesterol esterase , but coincide in their common inhibition by diethyl-umbeliferyl phosphate. the neutral esterase activity may also be related to hormone-sensitive lipase  <cit> ; the recent finding of this enzyme in the intestinal mucosa  <cit>  further strengthens this assumption.

the effectiveness of the combined luminal , intestinal and liver esterases to hydrolyse oleoyl-dhea is probably the expression of a powerful and relatively non-specific system of steroid ester hydrolysis that can have a significant influence on the handling, absorption and eventual therapeutic effects of a number of acyl esters of steroidal hormones administered orally.

CONCLUSIONS
the oral administration of oleoyl-dhea as a form of retarding the plasma availability of dhea has not been proved effective, since the hydrolysis of the ester proceeds at a fast pace and probably in the intestine itself, making practically undistinguishable the handling of label from dhea or oleoyl-dhea after a short initial period.

the overall esterase activity was very similar for male and female rats, in agreement with the rapid hydrolysis of most acyl-dhea, irrespective of sex.

incorporation of dhea into plasma dhea-sulfate is markedly sex-dependent, hinting at different dhea handling pathways in males and females. this is supported by the different distribution of label in adipose and other tissues, also influenced by site anatomic and physiological peculiarities.
