BACKGROUND
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  is the etiologic agent of an ongoing respiratory disease outbreak that emerged in saudi arabia in  <dig>  mers-cov is most closely related to tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku <dig> and pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku <dig>  <cit> , highlighting the ever present threat of zoonotic transmission of novel pathogenic coronaviruses. middle east respiratory syndrome  resembles acute respiratory disease syndrome  caused by severe acute respiratory disease syndrome coronavirus  in  <dig> and  <dig>  with some mers patients exhibiting progressive respiratory distress and renal failure  <cit> . despite similarities in overt clinical disease, mers-cov is distinct from sars-cov in that the virus utilizes a different cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase- <dig>   <cit> , and exhibits an expanded host cell tropism, readily replicating in a variety of human lung cell types including fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells, and type ii pneumocytes  <cit> .

innate immune and pro-inflammatory responses to mers-cov remains poorly understood. human cell culture models of mers infection have shown a deficiency in interferon  induction and innate immune responses, which may in part result from multiple mechanisms of mers-cov regulation of host antiviral responses. in addition to accessory protein 4a , the mers-cov viral papain-like protease  can also block ifn-β induction, as well as downregulate expression of ccl <dig> and cxcl <dig> pro-inflammatory cytokine genes  <cit> . siu and colleagues showed that the block in ifn production is in part the result of mers-cov p4a interaction with cellular dsrna-binding protein pact that interferes with the activation of rig-i-like receptors rig-i and mda <dig>  <cit> . in a <dig> lung epithelial cells and human bronchus and lung tissue ex vivo cultures, mers-cov sa  <dig> failed to induce significant expression differences of ifnb <dig> and tnf genes relative to mock throughout the 72 hour infection course  <cit> . the delay of ifn-β expression in response to mers-cov was also observed in calu- <dig> airway cells  <cit> . in a separate study, the expression of a panel of interferon-responsive genes, including ddx <dig> , il1b, and cxcl <dig>  was undetectable in human airway epithelial  cultures infected with mers-cov sa  <dig>  despite efficient viral replication  <cit> . however, pre-treatment of hae cells with recombinant ifn-α or ifn-λ suppressed mers-cov sa  <dig> replication, indicating viral sensitivity to innate immune responses  <cit> .

a functional genomics approach revealed mers-cov and infectious clone sars-cov  activated expression of pathogen recognition receptor genes and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes related to interleukin  <dig>  signaling by il-17a and il-17 f cytokines, while differentially regulating antigen presentation pathway gene expression  <cit> . the human immune response to mers-cov appears to be distinct across patients, with increased secretion of il-17a and il- <dig> in bronchoalveolar lavage  supernatants and increased cxcl <dig> in serum of patients infected with mers-cov  <cit> . the patient with the poor outcome showed decreased expression of innate immune genes, such as ddx <dig>  ifih <dig> , irf <dig>  irf <dig>  ifna, and ifnb <dig>  which may be the result of host and virus-specific genetic differences. recent phylogenetic analyses of the complete viral genome from  <dig> different mers cases demonstrate the extent of adaptive changes in mers-cov since the initial outbreak  <cit> .

to further investigate mers-cov regulation of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responses, we utilized an established human airway culture system to examine cellular responses against two genetically distinct mers-cov strains, a primary isolate obtained from a qatari patient treated at a london hospital in september  <dig> who later died after prolonged illness in june  <dig>   <cit>  and mers-cov sa  <dig> , the first virus identified from a fatal case in saudi arabia in june  <dig>  <cit> . there are a total of  <dig> amino acid differences between these two viruses spanning the length of the viral genome, as well as deletions of two amino acids in the nucleocapsid protein of mers-cov eng  <dig> compared to mers-cov sa  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
using a human airway cell culture model, we sought to understand which specific signaling events would be determinant components of the host response to mers-cov infection. we took a genomics-based approach and assessed the whole transcriptome by microarray analysis to 1) topologically characterize the kinetic and magnitudinal changes in the host response elicited by mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> and 2) identify contrasting genes between the two viruses related to innate and pro-inflammatory signal stimulation. utilizing cytokine treatment transcriptomic data sets derived from the same model system, we pursued cytokine signaling events in mers-cov-infected calu- <dig> cells driving statistically significant contrasting gene expression observed between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig>  on the basis of the virus-contrasting genes, we predicted stat <dig> as a regulator of mers-cov-induced host responses, with strain-specific differences in stat3-mediated gene expression.

topological characterization of the host response shows spatio-temporal transcriptomic differences between mers-cov strains
human calu- <dig> 2b <dig> cells were infected with one of two different mers-cov strains, mers-cov sa  <dig> or mers-cov eng  <dig>  or with icsars-cov, and cell lysates were harvested throughout the infection course for microarray analysis. we first characterized topological differences of the whole transcriptome on euclidean metric space for the collection of  <dig> samples  using recent methods from computational topology, including persistence homology  <cit> . many data reduction methods rely on embedding high-dimensional data into two dimensions. multi-dimensional scaling , for example, calculates coordinates for a 2-dimensional embedding of the experimental data by minimizing the deviation between embedded and original data . persistence homology, on the other hand, performs computation of topological invariants in the dimension of the original dataset and is, unlike mds, more stable under perturbation. to assess global kinetic dissimilarities across different cov infections, we calculated topological differences between mers-cov sa  <dig>  mers-cov eng  <dig> and icsars-cov, each grouped throughout all time points and with data set-matched mock samples. the kinetics of the host response refers to the spread of infected samples relative to mock samples over time. there were large topological differences between mers-cov eng  <dig> and icsars-cov , and between mers-cov sa  <dig> and icsars-cov , and moderate differences between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig>  .table  <dig>

for comparison of topological differences in the host response, we calculated persistence homology bar codes for data set-matched mock and infected samples. the differences between bar codes were calculated using a maximal bipartite graph matching algorithm. for icsars-cov we also included  <dig> and  <dig> hpi samples.



to further assess the magnitude impact of mers-cov infection in calu- <dig> 2b <dig> cells, we integrated viral genomic rna levels into a topological assessment of host response differences. mers-cov genomic rna was measured by qrt-pcr using primer  located in the leader region  and primer  located in the orf <dig> region of the cov genome . additionally, we measured viral titers by plaque assay and found mers-cov sa  <dig> had more robust infectious viral particle production than mers-cov eng  <dig>  with significantly different viral titers at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, despite similar viral genomic rna levels at these late time points . in measuring viral genomic rna and infectious viral particle production, we assessed two different stages in the viral life cycle and the data support differences in the kinetics of replication for the two mers-cov strains. since our analysis focuses on the host response to infection and its origin in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immune responses, we computationally integrated viral genomic rna with host mrna to better assess the differences in host response kinetics. towards this end, we used a filtered clustering method  <cit>  that reduced the space of  <dig> samples to a clustering graph of  <dig> nodes. first, the viral genomic rna levels were used as a filter to bin the samples into overlapping subsets with similar viral load . second, within each subset, samples that showed a high degree of interconnection were retained. thus, there was high similarity in gene expression levels within each subset. for a graphical representation, each set of retained samples formed a node and nodes were considered as adjacent whenever they had at least one sample in common . mock-infected samples were all in one isolated cluster. with increasing viral load, the temporal delay between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> started as early as 3 hours post infection , with  <dig> and  <dig> hpi mers-cov eng  <dig> samples clustering with  <dig> and  <dig> hpi mers-cov sa  <dig> samples. genomic rna levels at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi between the two viruses were not statistically different as determined by the non-parametric mann-whitney test. despite similar viral grna at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi , the filtered clustering approach demonstrated mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> were distinct at the late time points, with  <dig> and  <dig> hpi mers-cov eng  <dig> samples separated from  <dig> hpi mers-cov sa  <dig> samples .figure  <dig>

taken together, these whole transcriptome topological analyses showed robust differences in both kinetics and magnitude of the host response between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig>  despite similar viral replication. another example where viral replication may not be the best readout of host response differences is icsars-cov. the deletion of the entire orf <dig> gene of icsars-cov  does not impact viral replication compared to wild-type icsars-cov, yet substantial differences in the host response between the two viruses are detected in calu- <dig> 2b <dig> cells  <cit> .

mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> elicit striking differences in epithelial adherens junction signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling late in infection
differential gene expression between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> was directly examined by comparing fold changes with respect to time- and experiment-matched mocks . we found the most robust transcriptional changes to mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> infections occurred at the late times points . compared to mers-cov sa  <dig> there was an accelerated host response to mers-cov eng  <dig>  with differential gene expression observed as early as  <dig> hpi. as shown in figure  <dig>  mds representation of mers-cov sa  <dig>  mers-cov eng  <dig> and icsars-cov samples for  <dig> de genes changing in at least one virus condition and at one time-point confirmed the early onset of host responses to mers-cov eng  <dig> infection and the sustained separation between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> beginning at  <dig> hpi. the mds representation also showed mers-cov eng  <dig> samples in an intermediate position between mers-cov sa  <dig> and icsars-cov, with the host response to icsars-cov being largely delayed until  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. there is increasing evidence that interferon  antagonism and avoidance of interferon-stimulated gene  effector functions are major contributors to the delayed host response in icsars-cov infection  <cit> . in this context, the intermediate positioning of mers-cov eng  <dig> between mers-cov sa  <dig> and icsars-cov led us to investigate mers-cov strain-specific differences in innate immune signaling early in infection and the subsequent impact on the later host response.figure  <dig>

the greatest number of gene expression differences between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> were induced at the late time points, with  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes differentially expressed  at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively . there was a total of  <dig> de genes between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> in at least one time point . in comparison to mers-cov sa  <dig>  there was an earlier host response to mers-cov eng  <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. the accelerated calu- <dig> response to mers-cov eng  <dig> may be the result of the difference in kinetics of viral grna replication, with mers-cov eng  <dig> more efficiently replicating at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi compared to mers-cov sa  <dig> . alternatively, the delay in the host response to mers-cov sa  <dig> may be due to the virus more efficiently evading innate immune responses that leads to enhanced viral replication compared to mers-cov eng  <dig> . between the two viruses there are amino acid differences in orf4a and plpro, viral proteins known to modulate the innate immune response during mers infection . we further examined host gene expression at the early time-points  and found significant enrichment of genes associated with the stat <dig> pathway. stat <dig> pathway genes cdc25a, myc, socs <dig> and socs <dig> were more strongly induced by mers-cov eng  <dig> compared to mers-cov sa  <dig>  particularly at  <dig> hpi . increased socs gene expression and decreased expression of pim <dig> gene in response to mers-cov eng <dig> indicated decreased stat <dig> activity and possibly differential induction of apoptosis-related pathways. in a direct virus comparison, differential expression of pro-apoptotic bid, bax, and bim genes was observed at the early time-points and by  <dig> hpi there was extensive cytopathic effects caused by both viral infections that was likely the result of caspase-dependent apoptosis, as previously shown for mers infection  <cit> . of the  <dig> contrasting genes,  <dig> genes were also de against time- and data set-matched mocks. hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> de genes resulted in distinct gene clusters, with striking expression pattern contrasts between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. as shown in table  <dig>  functional analysis of the five most prominent clusters with contrasting gene expression revealed enrichment of integrin linked kinase  signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling pathways, glutathione metabolism, and interferon and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. genes related to glutathione metabolism included gstm <dig> and gstm <dig>  which were strongly downregulated in response to both viruses. isgs, ifit <dig> and ifit <dig>  were highly induced in response to both mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig>  with pronounced early up-regulation specifically in response to mers-cov eng  <dig>  genes associated with ilk signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling pathways were strongly downregulated in response to mers-cov sa  <dig>  whereas mers-cov eng  <dig> predominantly up-regulated expression of these genes at the late time points . within the highly enriched pathways, cellular genes including pvrl <dig>  rhof and crebbp with highest expression contrasts between the two infections were chosen for confirmation by qrt-pcr . pro-inflammatory csf <dig> gene was found more highly induced by mers-cov sa  <dig> , whereas ccl <dig> gene was more highly induced by mers-cov eng  <dig> . examination of the aforementioned contrasting genes showed that only a small number of those were already differentially expressed at the early time-points. for example, expression of rhof gene in response to mers-cov eng  <dig> was increased 4-fold relative to mock at  <dig> hpi, whereas mers-cov sa  <dig> did not induce rhof gene expression at this time-point. we therefore focused on differences in the host response mainly at the later time-points that had the highest number of contrasting genes.figure  <dig>

mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> elicit differences in the timing of cytokine-mediated innate immune and pro-inflammatory responses in calu- <dig> cells
while there was no difference in ifn- β gene expression detected between the two mers-cov strains, there was differential ifn-α <dig> and ifn- γ gene expression. specifically, expression of ifn-γ was downregulated early after infection in mers-cov eng 1-infected calu- <dig> cells and up-regulated in mers-cov sa 1-infected calu- <dig> cells. to some extent, this was also observed for ifn-α <dig> gene expression, which showed higher up-regulation in response to mers-cov sa  <dig> at  <dig> hpi, as confirmed by qrt-pcr . in addition, ifn-λ <dig> and ifn-λ <dig> were de relative to mock with high up-regulation at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi for both viruses.

there were no virus-specific differences in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, il-1α or tnfα-ip <dig>  which were highly up-regulated in response to both mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig>  the cell migration-promoting factor, tnfα-ip <dig>  <cit> , was highly up-regulated for mers-cov eng  <dig> alone . cytokines appear to be important for mers infection. to explore potential mechanisms regulating cytokine activity in response to mers-cov, we designed a microarray experiment to analyze calu- <dig> responses to various cytokine treatments and develop signatures that were then examined in the context of mers-cov-infected calu- <dig> cells. calu- <dig> cells were treated with either human recombinant interferon ifn-α, ifn-γ, tnf or il-1α, and cell lysates collected at different time points post-treatment for microarray. we found  <dig> de genes responsive to recombinant ifn-α and  <dig> de genes responsive to recombinant ifn-γ, and as expected, the majority of these genes were up-regulated following stimulation  <cit> . in response to pro-inflammatory cytokine treatment, we found  <dig> de genes responsive to recombinant tnf and  <dig> de genes responsive to recombinant il-1α, which were also differentially expressed in response to mers-cov sa  <dig> or mers-cov eng  <dig>  many of these genes showed cytokine-specific expression for ifn-α , ifn-γ , and il-1α . tnf induced the least number of de genes compared to the other cytokines . within the cytokine-stimulated genes we identified a set of  <dig> genes showing strong contrasts at late time points  between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> .figure  <dig>

topological analysis of gene expression restricted to ifn and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes sets revealed ifn induction  as a major contributor to kinetic differences between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> infection . the relative numbers of cytokine genes, which were also de after mers-cov sa  <dig> or mers-cov eng  <dig> infection , indicated the contribution of these specific gene sets to global gene expression changes in mers infection. functional analysis of the cytokine de genes showed antigen presentation pathway was significantly enriched in mers-cov-induced ifn-γ responses, as well as enrichment of genes associated with adaptive immune responses such as ox <dig> signaling and cytotoxic t lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis pathways. ifn-α response genes were significantly enriched for cellular pathways involved in the antiviral response, such as interferon regulatory factor  activation by pathogen recognition receptors . pro-inflammatory mediators, il-1α and tnf, which stimulate genes related to il- <dig> signaling, were identified following mers infection. for example, pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  regulated by il-17a  <cit>  and play a prominent role in airway inflammation and disease, and nf-κb genes, nfkbia, nfkb <dig> and nfkbie, were all found to be de in response to tnf and mers-cov infection.

predicted role for stat <dig> in mediating gene expression changes between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> in calu- <dig> infected cells
to further investigate potential regulators mediating the gene expression contrasts between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> at the late time points, we performed an upstream regulator analysis in ingenuity pathway analysis  that identifies upstream transcriptional regulators based on the observed gene expression changes in the experimental data set and compiled knowledge of reported relationships between regulators and their known target genes within the ingenuity pathway knowledge base. the nupr <dig> gene encoding a transcription factor known as stress-activated nuclear protein  <dig> had a predicted inhibition  for mers-cov sa  <dig> and predicted activation  for mers-cov eng  <dig> at  <dig> hpi . this lps-induced transcription factor is an important regulator of apoptosis, cell proliferation and autophagy . differentially expressed genes between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> that are binding partners and downstream targets, such as ep <dig> and tesk <dig>  shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  were downregulated in mers-cov sa  <dig> virus-infected cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi and up-regulated in mers-cov eng  <dig> virus-infected cells at these late time points, corroborating the predicted nupr <dig> regulator status in response to these two mers-cov strains.table  <dig>

stat <dig> acts as a critical regulator of cellular repair processes upon acute lung injury and bcl <dig> has been shown to reduce lung inflammation in mice by regulating granulocytes  <cit> . in addition to bcl <dig>  several other contrasting stat <dig> target genes, including bcl <dig>  il <dig>  and pml, have been reported to impact pro-inflammatory responses , epithelial integrity and the severity of lung injury after infection  <cit> . we postulate the difference in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression may be the result of differential stat <dig> activity. for example, sars-cov directly impacts stat <dig> activity by dephosphorylating stat <dig> at tyr- <dig> after  <dig> hpi in infected vero e <dig> cells  <cit> . here, the mers-cov strain-specific differences may be a causative factor in leading to differential stat <dig> activation and the down-stream effects of pro-inflammatory responses.

CONCLUSIONS
mers-cov is a novel pathogenic coronavirus and the innate and inflammatory response during mers infection is poorly understood. using an established human airway culture model we found differences in host gene expression between mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> that support the hypothesis of strain-specific differences related to functional differences in the sensitivity to innate immune responses  <cit> . through our genomics-based approach, we found  topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig>  with  a precursory host response in mers-cov eng 1-infected cells,  differential expression of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes between mers-cov eng  <dig> and mers-cov sa  <dig> that may be associated with downstream effects of ifn, tnf and il-1α signaling, and  a predicted activation for stat <dig> mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial cell remodeling in mers-cov eng  <dig> infection.

at present, nonhuman primates serve as the best available model of mers-cov pathogenesis, with animals developing moderate clinical disease and signs of histopathologic changes in the lung  <cit> . while there is no current small-animal model of mers infection, immunocompromised mice transduced with an adenoviral vector expressing human dpp <dig> show increased susceptibility to mers-cov infection  <cit> . in a separate study, a variant of pipistrellus bat coronavirus  strain hku <dig> expressing the sars-cov spike  glycoprotein ectodomain  resulted in enhanced morbidity and acute changes in lung histopathology in aged balb/c mice following mouse adaptation  <cit> . the present cytokine systems approach provides valuable insight into differences of cellular antiviral responses to distinct mers-cov strains. in line with these observations, reversal of infection gene signatures that can attenuate viral replication or enhance innate immune responses to the most highly pathogenic mers-cov strain could be investigated in this model system. we are beginning to better understand that different mers-cov strains can result in variable host responses, as observed with the recent clinical study by faure and colleagues  <cit> . the patients infected with mers-cov sa  <dig> and mers-cov eng  <dig> had both a fatal outcome, with the mers-cov sa 1-infected patient succumbing to infection within 11 days after admission, 18 days to death following initial symptoms  <cit> . the mers-cov eng  <dig> patient on the other hand had an initially transient illness and then rapidly declined to a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome remaining in this state for 9 months before death  <cit> . having an efficient innate immune response likely dictates a patient’s disease progression and would thus be a primary goal for in silico drug predictions, which could then be tested in vitro with a particular focus on cytokine stimulated genes  <cit> . toward this end, extending the collection of transcriptomic profiles to include more mers-cov strains will be important for a deeper view of the host response during mers infection and toward a greater understanding of mers-cov pathogenicity.
