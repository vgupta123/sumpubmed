BACKGROUND
the mouse pdcd <dig> gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome   <dig>  tail-to-tail to the gene for tata-binding protein , which makes it a candidate for the mouse hst <dig> gene  <cit> . the distance between the stop codons of tbp and pdcd <dig> is  <dig>  kb. the arrangement of these two genes is also conserved in human  <cit>  and at least five nonmammalian vertebrates  <cit> . the proteasome subunit c <dig> gene  is syntenic with these two genes in the mouse, being located head-to-head with tbp, and in all vertebrates investigated thus far  <cit> . these genes are nonrandomly distributed also in nonvertebrate genomes  <cit> . the coordinated expression of these three genes could be one of the possible reasons for this observation.

in the rat, transcription of the pdcd <dig>  gene was induced when thymocytes underwent programmed cell death caused by applying radiation or dexamethasone  <cit>  and in fibroblasts after exposure to neutron radiation  <cit> . the amount of the rat protein increased in nuclei of kidney fibroblasts after prolonged hypoxia  <cit> . the mrna of the human orthologous gene, pdcd <dig>  was upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome  <cit> . however, the upregulation of the mouse and human orthologous genes has not been universally associated with apoptosis  <cit> .

the product of the pdcd <dig> gene and its orthologs consists of two domains: a mynd zinc-finger dna-binding domain found in transcription regulators and a highly conserved c-terminal  domain of unknown function. the human pdcd <dig> gene has two forms. the alternative, less abundant pdcd <dig> mrna is formed due to a polyadenylation  signal in the third intron. the resulting product thus carries the mynd, but not the ct domain . pdcd <dig> is negatively regulated by the b-cell lymphoma  <dig>  gene in lymph node germinal centers of human tonsils  <cit> , but no such repression was found in immortalized primary b cells  <cit> . pdcd <dig> is also a regulator of the host cell factor c <dig>  gene; mutations in hcfc <dig> arrest cells in the middle of the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . pdcd <dig> is a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene on human chr 6q <dig>  <cit> . pdcd <dig> and tbp are candidate type  <dig> diabetes susceptibility loci  <cit> . a possible haploinsufficiency effect at the 6q <dig> tumor-suppressor locus has been suggested  <cit> . a haploinsufficiency gene  is also located on mouse chr  <dig>  in a region that includes pdcd <dig>  <cit> . the mouse pdcd <dig> gene has been considered a candidate imprinted gene, as it is differentially expressed in  <dig> -day-post-coitum  parthenogenetic versus androgenetic mouse embryos of the c57bl/6j  strain  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to characterize in detail transcription within the pdcd <dig> locus and its vicinity, as well as its imprinting status and candidacy for the hst <dig> locus. to elucidate the reasons for the conservation of the synteny surrounding pdcd <dig>  we also analyzed the transcription and imprinting of the neighboring genes.

RESULTS
alternative transcript of the mouse pdcd <dig> gene
to look for isoforms of the mouse pdcd <dig> mrna, we used the blast program to identify ests matching the pdcd <dig> genomic sequence. the presence of a putative alternative pdcd <dig> exon, which starts  <dig> bp from the 3' end of the constitutive pdcd <dig> transcript, was detected . the est clone was then sequenced from its 3' end and a polya tail was found. the 3' end was preceded by a polya signal, aataaa. no a-rich sequence that could cause a spurious priming of the oligo-dt primer during cdna preparation was found in the genomic dna. the alternative transcript of pdcd <dig> was confirmed by rt-pcr of testicular rna . the alternative mrna contained a new exon on its 3' end, which replaced the fifth and sixth constitutive pdcd <dig> exons and thus also changed the open reading frame . the alternative transcript thus does not contain the highly conserved ct domain, as with the human pdcd <dig> isoform  <dig> . however, unlike the pdcd <dig> orf, the human orf is truncated by the end of exon  <dig> . the 3' race method confirmed the 3' end of the alternative pdcd <dig> transcript also in testicular rna. the sequenced race product was the same as deduced from the est clone  <dig>  the length of the pdcd <dig> alternative exon was  <dig> bp. the 3' end of the alternative exon matched another est sequence from e <dig> embryo , but the alternative exon was  <dig> bp in length according to this est .

rnas transcribed from the opposite strand of the pdcd <dig> locus and its vicinity
the blast output of the genomic region covered by the alternative pdcd <dig> transcript also contained five other ests . due to their orientation, these ests could represent an antisense transcript of the alternative exon of pdcd <dig>  the opposite end of the aa <dig> est clone was therefore sequenced. the antisense orientation was confirmed by the presence of polya tail preceded by a polya signal . there was no a-rich sequence in the genomic dna that would cause a mispriming of the oligo-dt primer during cdna preparation. the 3' race method and sequencing were then used to identify the antisense transcript in mouse testis as well. the est and race sequences were identical and matched the genomic pdcd <dig> sequence in the entire alternative exon and a part of the alternative intron,  <dig> bp apart from the constitutive polya site of pdcd <dig>  the sequences did not contain the sequence of the pdcd <dig> constitutive exons . by rt-pcr and sequencing, it was confirmed that this transcript  is a novel alternatively polyadenylated form of the neighboring tbp gene.

four other ests, two from mammary tumor  and two from a forelimb of e <dig> embryo  were identified upstream of the 5' end of pdcd <dig>  suggesting there may be a new gene transcribed from the same promoter as pdcd <dig>  but in the opposite orientation. this 5' region is not conserved in human. the transcription status of this mouse region was investigated by rt-pcr and race methods. a transcript encompassing this sequence upstream of the pdcd <dig> gene was found in mouse testes and other tissues. at least two alternative forms of this transcript  formed by different polyadenylation were identified by 3' race and rt-pcr, one of them having the same 3'-end as the est cr <dig> . 5' race detected the 5' end consistent with est cj <dig> . the bi-directional function of the pdcd <dig> promoter is also supported by our finding of two tags in the cage  database  <cit> . the cage method measures the expression levels of transcription starting sites by sequencing 5' ends of transcripts prepared through modifying their caps. the cage tags t17f00dae0f <dig> and t17f00dae <dig> suggest that transcription also occurs in the updcd <dig> direction. however, there are about ten times more cage tags in the pdcd <dig> direction, suggesting the promoter activity is much stronger in the direction of pdcd <dig> than in that of updcd <dig> 

on the other hand, these identified rnas could also represent a novel alternative transcript of the tbp gene, an antisense read-through of the entire pdcd <dig> gene. therefore, rt-pcr with a updcd2-specific primer used for reverse transcription and pcr with primer pairs along the pdcd <dig> and tbp genes were used to identify this read-through transcript . as the pcr products along the entire pdcd <dig> gene, the pdcd2-tbp intergenic region and the last exons of tbp genes were successfully amplified and sequenced, the pdcd2as <dig> transcript appears to be another new alternative form of tbp originating by alternative polyadenylation and encompassing the entire pdcd <dig> gene in the antisense orientation . thus, our data indicate that there is both a new alternative tbp mrna and a new gene sharing the pdcd <dig> promoter.

furthermore, the blast search of the tbp-pdcd <dig> intergenic region revealed nine ests, which apparently represent another alternative transcript of the tbp gene. three 3' est sequences  extend the previously characterized 3'utr of tbp by  <dig> bp. six est sequences  overlap the former three ests and each other and extend by  <dig> bp in the 3'direction. a 3'race product was obtained from a testicular rna and sequenced. it contains the polyadenylation signal attaaa and carries the same end as est bb <dig>  no a-rich sequence that could cause an oligo-dt mispriming during cdna preparation was found in the genomic dna.

taken together, besides the updcd <dig> transcripts, there are three to four alternative tbp forms transcribed from the opposite dna strand in the pdcd <dig> locus and its vinicity, including pdcd2as <dig>  pdcd2as <dig>  3'race-confirmed mrna, and the transcript suggested by the three embryonic ests incl. bg <dig>  the alternative mrnas of the tbp gene arise by alternative polyadenylation and differ in overlaps with the pdcd <dig> gene .

transcription analyses of mouse pdcd <dig> and tbp loci
the expression of all identified pdcd <dig> and tbp transcripts was detected by rt-pcr in all eight tissues examined, as well as in different developmental stages of the testis . to find whether the antisense transcripts could participate in the regulation of the ratio between the mrna isoforms  <cit> , the level of expression of pdcd <dig> and tbp alternative transcripts was more accurately determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr  in seven mouse tissues , as well as in developmental stages of the testis  using primers detecting the pdcd <dig> constitutive, alternative, pdcd2as <dig> and pdcd2as <dig> transcripts .

in tissues, relatively higher levels of the alternative pdcd <dig> transcript correlated with upregulation of the pdcd2-antisense alternative tbp transcripts. however, no such relationship was detected in the developmental stages of testes .

the levels of all examined transcripts were determined using the absolute quantification method in seven mouse tissues . the levels of the alternative pdcd <dig> transcripts are on average  <dig> times lower compared to the level of the constitutive pdcd <dig> transcript in the analyzed tissues. the pdcd2as <dig> transcript was expressed in tissues on average  <dig> times less than the constitutive pdcd <dig>  the levels of the pdcd2as <dig> transcript in tissues were comparable to that of the constitutive pdcd <dig> transcript. the level of all tbp forms  in the testes was nearly  <dig> times higher than the level of pdcd2-antisense alternative tbp transcripts, in contrast to only 3-fold difference in other tissues .

the variations of the expression of the sense/antisense  transcripts in different cell types could make the sa relationship in developmental stages of the testis undetectable. to identify the pdcd2/tbp sa transcript ratios in homogenous cell populations, pure flow sorted populations of spermatogenic cells were isolated and the mrna levels of pdcd <dig> and antisense tbp transcripts were assessed by qrt-pcr . the alternative pdcd <dig> transcript was detected just in the population of leptotene spermatocytes. the expression of the antisense transcripts exhibited neither positive nor negative correlation with this restricted alternative pdcd <dig> expression, suggesting that there is no regulation of the pdcd <dig> alternatives by the antisense rnas in these cells . also, the higher quantity of total tbp transcripts was detected in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids.

long perfect dsrna duplexes, resulting from the antisense transcription, can be substrates for adenosine deaminase  enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosines to inosines. massive a/i editing can cause the subsequent retention of the edited rnas in the nucleus  <cit> . to test whether the pdcd2as <dig> or pdcd2as <dig> transcripts can drive the expression of the sense pdcd <dig> transcripts by such a mechanism, the mrna levels of pdcd <dig> and both their antisense rnas were measured in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by qrt-pcr. the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios of the tested genes disclose the nuclear localization of pdcd2as <dig> and pdcd2as <dig> transcripts, but cytoplasmic localization of the pdcd <dig> mrnas .

alternative and antisense transcription at the chicken, rat, and human pdcd <dig> loci
recently, the chicken region containing the pdcd <dig>  tbp, and psmb <dig> genes was sequenced and major transcripts identified by rt-pcr . the genes are in the same order and orientation as their mouse and human orthologs. the organization of the coding exons of the chicken pdcd <dig> gene  is the same as in the mouse and human. provided that the alternative and antisense transcripts are important for the function of the pdcd <dig> orthologous genes, these features should also be conserved in the chicken genome. conserved overlapping transcription could also shed light on the synteny conservation. we therefore looked for alternative and antisense transcription at the chicken pdcd <dig> locus by est analysis, race and rt-pcr. a putative alternative pdcd <dig> transcript that suggests skipping exons  <dig> and  <dig> and a part of exon  <dig> was detected in the dbest database . the presence of the alternative transcript in chicken was confirmed by rt-pcr and sequencing of testicular rna. this alternative mrna does not contain the ct domain, as with the mouse and human alternative transcripts. however, unlike mouse or human, the chicken orf is truncated before the end of exon  <dig> .

the overlapping transcription of chicken pdcd <dig> and tbp was suggested by ests  and it was confirmed by rt-pcr of testicular rna using primers from the intergenic region in combination with primers from the exons of tbp and pdcd <dig>  respectively. the sequence of the pcr products indicated an overlap of at least  <dig> bp between alternative pdcd <dig> and tbp transcripts . the sa overlap is thus conserved in chicken. our rt-pcr data also indicate that the chicken tbp gene has another alternatively polyadenylated form even longer than the one published by yamauchi et al.  <cit> .

the human pdcd <dig> has an alternative transcript formed by polyadenylation in the third intron . however, est bq <dig> from fetal eye and eight others suggest alternative splicing rather than alternative polyadenylation . no overlapping transcription in the human is indicated by the ests, although there are  <dig> ests  in the pdcd2-tbp intergenic region, which could represent an alternative human pdcd <dig> isoform, generated by alternative polyadenylation. however, the analysis of this region is hindered by an a-rich sequence.

there is also a putative alternatively polyadenylated transcript of rp <dig>  the rat homolog of the mouse pdcd <dig> gene . two ests matching the rp8-tbp intergenic region  suggest overlapping transcription in rat, because they are in the opposite orientation. there are also two ests in the third rp <dig> intron  in the opposite direction than the rp <dig> gene. the alternative form of the rp <dig> gene lacking the ct domain has not been suggested by any est yet.

analysis of coordinated expression of three genes of a highly conserved synteny
the orthologs of pdcd <dig> and its neighboring genes tbp and psmb <dig> are nonrandomly distributed in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> , but the reason for this observation is unknown. as one of the possible reasons could be the coordinated expression of these three genes, we have tested this hypothesis by qrt-pcr in mouse tissues. the three genes are housekeeping, but the expression of tbp has been reported to be highly elevated in the testis  <cit> , while the other genes were not tested in this organ. as shown in fig.  <dig>  tbp but not pdcd <dig> or psmb <dig> were overexpressed in the testis. thus, there are some regulatory elements of tbp not accessible by the other two genes. indeed, analyses of a much broader panel of tissues and stages by microarrays suggested a different pattern of expression for these three genes  <cit> . it is therefore improbable that the reason for the synteny conservation is the co-expression of these genes.

evaluation of pdcd <dig> as a candidate for hst1
to evaluate the pdcd <dig> gene as a candidate for the hst <dig>  its testicular transcript was isolated by pcr from the c3h/j mouse testicular library and sequenced. the c3h/j strain carries the hst1f allele, but it has the same predicted protein product as b <dig> . no polymorphism between b <dig> and c3h/j strains was detected in  <dig> bp of the promoter region of pdcd <dig> .

in 15-day-old mice, significant differences between the frequency of pachytene spermatocytes in the testis of prospectively fertile and sterile hybrids can be detected , suggesting that hst <dig> could be differentially expressed at this stage. the amount of the pdcd <dig> transcripts was therefore compared in fertile and sterile hybrid mouse testis by northern blotting with the β-actin probe used as a standard  and by qrt-pcr using the gapdh gene as a standard . the alternative pdcd <dig>  pdcd2as <dig> and pdcd2as <dig> were also tested by qrt-pcr. there were no significant differences in the expression of these four transcripts between the prospectively fertile and sterile 15-day-old hybrids. therefore, pdcd <dig> is unlikely to be the hst <dig> gene. a significant upregulation of the tbp, pdcd2as <dig> and pdcd2as <dig> transcripts was detected in fertile compared to sterile adult hybrids . this difference is probably caused by distinct cellular composition of adult fertile and sterile testes that differ in the number of pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids  <cit> . these cell types vary in the pattern of expression of tbp transcripts .

analysis of genomic imprinting of mouse pdcd <dig> and neighboring genes
differential expression of the mouse pdcd <dig> gene was reported in e <dig>  parthenogenetic versus androgenetic mouse embryonic tissues of the b <dig> strain, suggesting it may be paternally imprinted  <cit> . nikaido and colleagues have also suggested that the chromodomain  <dig>  gene located  <dig> kilobases from pdcd <dig> is maternally imprinted. the imprinting of pdcd <dig> and neighboring loci could explain the conservation of the synteny. to determine whether the pdcd <dig> gene and its neighbors are imprinted, polymorphisms in their transcripts were searched comparing the sequences of the mouse strains b <dig> and pwd/ph   <cit> . one single-nucleotide polymorphism  was detected in the coding region of the constitutive pdcd <dig> transcript. this synonymous g/a transition is located in exon  <dig> and thus not present in the alternative pdcd <dig> transcript . primers used to amplify the constitutive mrna were from exons  <dig> and  <dig> and did not detect the pdcd2as <dig> transcript. the snp was analyzed in pdcd <dig> transcripts from rnas of e <dig>  embryos and placentas obtained from reciprocal backcrosses ) and  × b6). backcross animals were used to control the contamination of placentas by maternal tissues. the dnas of the embryos were genotyped for chr  <dig> and the rnas from placentas of b6/b <dig> embryos were tested by rt-pcr for a b6/pwd polymorphic marker in tbp . we found that the placentas were strongly contaminated by maternal tissue and thus were not useful for testing the imprinting status . therefore, the imprinting status of the pdcd <dig> gene was determined only in the embryos and yolk sacs from reciprocal f <dig> crosses and backcrosses of b <dig> and pwd. as both b <dig> and pwd alleles were present in b6/pwd heterozygous embryos, the pdcd <dig> constitutive transcript was imprinted neither in mouse e <dig>  embryo nor in yolk sac. polymorphisms were also detected in pdcd2as <dig> and pdcd2as <dig> mrnas in the region not overlapping with the pdcd <dig> transcripts as well as in five other genes from this region, including chd <dig>  tbp, psmb <dig>  d17ph4e, and dll <dig> . all these genes were tested for imprinting in the same way . none of these genes was imprinted.

discussion
we have analyzed in detail the transcription pattern of the putative apoptotic gene pdcd <dig>  <cit>  and the tightly linked tbp gene, a key factor in transcription initiation of all eukaryotes  <cit> .

one new alternative pdcd <dig> transcript, arising by alternative splicing, and at least three new transcripts of tbp originated by alternative polyadenylation have been identified in the mouse. the presence of the alternative pdcd <dig> mrna was also found in human  and chicken. although the mechanism and structure of these transcripts is different, in all three species the alternative pdcd <dig> transcript encodes the mynd zinc-finger domain but not the highly conserved ct domain, suggesting the biological importance of such truncated protein. the function of the alternative pdcd <dig> product can be deduced from the reported study of cell-cycle regulation  <cit> . the cell line used has a mutation in the hcfc <dig> gene, causing an arrest of the cell growth at the non-permissive temperature. transfection of a construct carrying the functional hcfc <dig> gene rescued the arrest. cotransfection of the complete pdcd <dig> greatly decreased the colony formation, while cotransfection with a truncated pdcd <dig>  consisting just of the mynd domain , increased it  <cit> . the function of the alternative pdcd <dig> is therefore likely to be opposite to that of the constitutive form. the ratio of the constitutive and alternative pdcd <dig> mrnas differs in the tissues, suggesting a developmental role.

we identified four alternatively polyadenylated alternative forms of tbp in the mouse. the regulation of the stability of tbp mrnas could be a potential role for all identified alternative forms of tbp, as the 3' utr determines the life-time of mrna  <cit> . moreover, two of four newly identified transcripts of the tbp gene overlap with pdcd <dig> transcripts forming the sa pairs. the overlapping transcription of some alternative pdcd <dig> and tbp transcripts was also confirmed in the chicken. the conservation of sa transcription could explain the conserved synteny of these two genes, although no correlated expression of tbp, pdcd <dig> and psmb <dig>  three genes of conserved synteny  <cit> , was observed. the mouse pdcd2as <dig> transcript overlaps just the alternative pdcd <dig> transcript, while pdcd2as <dig> overlaps the entire pdcd <dig> gene . we determined that their level of transcription represents the minority  of total tbp transcription and that they are mostly localized in the cell nucleus. both these facts suggest that they play some other regulatory role in gene expression than the protein coding one. moreover, they are transcribed at a level sufficient to interfere with the transcription of the neighboring pdcd <dig> gene. a possible mechanism of function of the pdcd2as <dig> transcript could be the downregulation of pdcd <dig> expression at the level of transcription via antisense-induced methylation of the cpg island of pdcd <dig> or by post-transcriptional degradation of mrna after the formation of dsrna  <cit> . antisense transcripts can participate in the regulation of the ratio between mrna isoforms  <cit> . correlated expression of the pdcd <dig> transcripts and overlapping antisense rnas was suggested by our quantitative expression studies in mouse tissues, but it was not confirmed by the quantification of these transcripts in various developmental stages of the testis nor in flow-sorted populations of spermatogenic cells. the pattern of the expression of pdcd <dig>  tbp, and psmb <dig> genes in sorted populations of spermatogenic cells is in agreement with the affymetrix microarray data of namekawa et al.  <cit> , measuring gene expression in staput-sorted spermatogenic cell populations. schmidt and schibler  <cit>  found that the tbp gene is upregulated in the testis. we have confirmed their suggestion that the increased transcription of tbp begins already in pachytene spermatocytes . on the other hand, mrnas of both the pdcd2-antisense tbp alternative transcripts are present at a higher level in spermatocytes and downregulated in spermatids, suggesting a distinct role for these mrnas and the constitutive tbp transcript in these cells.

there are several possible reasons why we could not detect any sa relationship. first, the antisense transcript could influence the expression of its sense partner at the level of mrna translation. this regulation is typical for micro-rnas and small rnas, which inhibit the target mrnas without destroying the template  <cit> . however, this mechanism is improbable, as micro-rnas do not show perfect complementarity with their target sequence in the majority of eukaryotes  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, the protein level of alternative and constitutive pdcd <dig> needs to be determined. second, the antisense regulation could be very dynamic or specific; the rapid change of sa ratio could be detectable just after specific stimuli in particular tissues or cells  <cit> .

we excluded that the antisense transcripts could drive the expression of the sense rna via mechanisms connected with massive a/i editing of long perfect dsrna duplexes, resulting from the antisense transcription and causing subsequent retention of the edited transcripts in the nucleus  <cit> , as we did not detect any difference in the sequence of cdna of the alternative pdcd <dig> exon prepared from the nuclear rna fraction. moreover, we did not find any dramatic difference in the nuclear vs. cytoplasmic ratio of pdcd <dig> transcripts in comparison to control genes. our results also suggest that the heterogeneity of the cell types in the testes was not the reason of the absence of any sa relationship through the measurement of pdcd2-tbp sa expression in the homogenous testicular cell populations. the proper biological function of pdcd2as <dig> and pdcd2as <dig> transcripts thus remains to be determined.

a large number of putative antisense transcripts have been found recently by mapping ests and/or cdnas in the mouse genome  <cit> . however, only a relatively small number of sa loci have been experimentally characterized by expression analysis  <cit> . here we present the identification and detailed characterization of a specific sa locus. the recent large-scale studies  <cit>  suggested that  <dig> to 72% of all genome-mapped transcription units in the mouse overlap with antisense cdna or est and multiple-sized transcripts are often generated from the sa loci  <cit> . in general, over 65% of transcriptional units produce multiple splice variants, and transcript diversity also arises through alternative promoter usage and alternative polyadenylation  <cit> . the significance of gene overlap has been shown  <cit>  by an evolutionary approach, as genes overlapping in mammals are more likely to have the same organization in the pufferfish. the pdcd2/tbp sa overlap is conserved in the mouse and chicken, suggesting its biological relevance.

we did not find any support for the candidacy of pdcd <dig> for hst <dig> by allelic sequencing and transcription analysis. our data indicate that pdcd <dig>  chd <dig>  and four other genes from this region are not imprinted in e <dig>  embryos as was suggested by nikaido et al. an explanation for these conflicting results could be that pdcd <dig> and chd <dig> are non-imprinted, but regulated by imprinted genes. alternatively, the conflict may be due to the use of placentas contaminated by maternal tissues by nikaido et al.  <cit> . it has been shown recently that the expression profiling of uniparental mouse embryos is highly inefficient in identifying novel imprinted genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the alternative pdcd <dig> transcripts, which encode the dna-binding mynd zinc-finger domain but not the ct domain, were identified in the mouse, human and chicken, suggesting the biological importance of such putative truncated protein. the alternative pdcd <dig> protein lacking the ct domain could interfere with the regulatory effect of the complete pdcd <dig> protein on gene expression of specific genes. the ratio of the constitutive and alternative pdcd <dig> mrnas differs in various tissues, suggesting a developmental role.

the identified tbp-alternative pdcd2-antisense transcripts seem to play some regulatory role in gene expression, compared to the protein-coding function of the constitutive tbp mrna. they are mostly localized in the cell nucleus and transcribed at a level sufficient to interfere with the transcription of the pdcd <dig> gene. the conservation of pdcd2/tbp sa overlap in the mouse and chicken also point out their biological relevance. furthermore, our data suggest that at least some of the cdnas identified in the large-scale sequencing projects labeled as noncoding rnas are in fact incomplete alternative cdnas of neighboring protein-coding genes.
