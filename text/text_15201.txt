BACKGROUND
the incorporation of genomic and transcriptomic approaches into ecological and evolutionary studies enables to further explore how natural populations respond to environmental change and anthropogenic pressures  <cit> . genome-scale approaches have the potential for identifying genes and genetic networks that underlie ecologically important traits, such as those linked to adaptation to cold temperatures  <cit> , defense mechanisms  <cit>  or response to pollutants  <cit> . changes in gene expression can be linked to phenotypic and environmental variation, hence advancing our understanding of the adaptive importance of gene functions and their ecological and evolutionary consequences  <cit> . the resilience of a species depends on its vulnerability in the face of environmental changes, which is determined by genetic composition and physiological tolerance  <cit> . changes in environmental conditions can rapidly lead to phenotypic change, involving either genetic  or plastic  changes. in the well-established model species fundulus heteroclitus, the species has evolved both highly plastic and locally adapted phenotypes within different selective contexts  <cit> . while plasticity has allowed the species to cope with environment variability, some f. heteroclitus populations have evolved pollution tolerance allowing them to survive concentrations of organic contaminants that are lethal to populations from clean habitats  <cit> , in a response that is not plastic but adaptive and heritable  <cit> .

while the evolutionary consequences of pollutants have been well explored in natural populations of freshwater fish using genomic and transcriptomic approaches , less attention has been paid to diadromous fish species that complete their life-cycle through ontogenic shifts between freshwater and marine habitats . the study of diadromous species is particularly relevant as they represent a natural model to understand the combined impact of continental anthropogenic and oceanic climate stressors. unlike other model fish species, very little is known about the ecological and evolutionary consequences in species with a catadromous life-strategy, such as the european eel anguilla anguilla, which illustrates an example of a fish species designated by the iucn as “critically endangered” and potentially strongly affected by human stressors throughout its life cycle.

the european eel is a facultative catadromous species with a particularly complex life cycle that includes an oceanic and a continental phase. after spawning in the sargasso sea, larvae cross the atlantic ocean following the prevailing currents and metamorphose into glass eels upon reaching the edge of the continental shelf off europe and north africa. glass eels complete the migration into riverine, estuarine and coastal feeding habitats as yellow eels, and after a highly variable feeding period, they metamorphose into silver eels that migrate back to the sargasso sea utilizing their high fat reserves, where they reproduce once and die  <cit> . homing to a single spawning ground explains the lack of genetic differentiation between geographic areas across europe, suggestive of a panmictic population  <cit> , while a large variance in parental reproductive success associated with fluctuating ocean conditions explains the pattern of genetic patchiness  found at local scale  <cit> .

there has been a continuous decline of continental yellow eel recruitment since the 1950s and marked decadal reductions in glass eel recruitment since the early 1980s  <cit> . over the last 5 years glass eel recruitment has been exceptionally low, averaging between less than 1%  and 5%  of the 1960– <dig> levels  <cit> . several causes have been put forward to explain the decline of the eel stock including anthropogenic factors such as overfishing, pollution, habitat degradation and man-introduced parasites and diseases  <cit> , as well as environmental factors such as climate and ocean current change  <cit> . recent genetic data suggest that the demographic decline did not entail a genetic decline of the same magnitude, as evidenced by the observation of a moderate to high level of genetic diversity, no signatures of a bottleneck episode and comparable values of short- and long-term effective population size  <cit> .

while eels are regarded as fairly resilient, often inhabiting unproductive waters and polluted habitats, they are prone to bioaccumulation of lipophilic contaminants due to their particular ecology  and physiology   <cit> . evidence has been presented that different kinds of chemical compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls , pesticides and toxic metals could have a serious impact on the health of the european eel [for a review see  <cit> . maes et al.  <cit>  observed a significant negative correlation between heavy metal pollution load and condition, as well as a reduced genetic variability in highly polluted eels originating from three belgian river basins. it has been hypothesized that the accumulation of contaminants in the fat tissue of eels during the feeding stage could impair the quality of spawners  <cit> . in this sense, a considerable decrease in condition and lipid energy stores might be responsible for migrating adults failing to swim the  <dig>  km distance to the sargasso sea  <cit> , while mobilization of lipids and lipophilic contaminants to the gonads during the transoceanic migration might compromise production of good quality eggs and normal development of early larval stages  <cit> .

understanding the impact of pollutants at the genomic and transcriptomic level is a critical point in order to safeguard the evolutionary adaptive potential of the european eel. several experimental studies on gene expression have shown genetic responses to pollutants in eel  <cit> . however, large-scale transcriptomic approaches in the european eel have been limited to the study of osmoregulation  <cit>  and comparative gene expression analysis between sympatric european and american eel larvae in the sargasso sea  <cit> . using the same microarray comprising about  <dig>  anonymous probes, kalujnaia et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a putative role in migration between freshwater and marine environments, while bernatchez et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes showing different timing of expression between the two atlantic eels. in this paper we first describe the development of an eel-specific microarray of about  <dig>  annotated cdnas based on a large collection of existing and novel high-throughput transcriptomic sequences. our approach aims at identifying genes involved in the response to pollutants by means of a comparative analysis of gene expression between environments with a varying level of pollution. as such, we aim at assessing the potential fitness consequences of bioaccumulation levels in individual eels and pinpoint the metabolic pathways most influenced by such stressors.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly and analysis
a total of  <dig>  reads were assembled into contigs using mira  <dig> . a first run of assembly produced  <dig>  contigs with a mean length of  <dig>  bp, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. on average, transcripts included  <dig>  reads  <dig> , with a read cover- <dig> age of  <dig>  . a second run conducted using the previously obtained contigs as input produced  <dig>  contigs. average length was similar to the first run , but average quality increased from a mean of  <dig>   to  <dig>  . a further quality check was conducted for the final set of putative transcripts by filtering sequences by length  and average sequence quality . a total of  <dig>  contigs were obtained, with a mean length of 511 bp and an average sequence quality of  <dig>  .

among all transcripts,  <dig>   showed blast matches. eukaryotes accounted for 96% of all blast hits, with vertebrates accounting for most  of the hits . among vertebrates, fish represented  <dig> % of all hits, followed by mammals . the most represented fish species was zebrafish danio rerio , followed by salmon salmo salar  and pufferfish takigufu rubripes . anguillids represented less than 5% of hits among fish, including japanese eel a. japonica , european eel a. anguilla  and american eel a. rostrata .

functional annotation using the blast2go suite showed  <dig>  of the contigs  associated to go terms, for a total of  <dig>  term occurrences. using the webtool categorizer, go classes were grouped in a total of  <dig> go-slim terms including biological process , molecular function  and cellular component  ontologies . catalytic activity and binding represented the majority of molecular functions. key processes such as metabolism and development were present among biological processes.

all contig sequences are available at eeelbase release  <dig> , a dedicated database implemented using the mysql and django web framework and freely available at: http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/eeelbase. the database is queryable by keywords and blast using nucleotide or protein sequences. for each contig  the fasta sequence is provided together with the list of all reads belonging to the contig, blast results and associated go terms. the web site also allows to perform alignments with reference genomes using on the fly blat search against the latest releases of the zebrafish and stickleback genomes in the ucsc genome browser.

pollution analysis
comparison of pollutants between the tiber  and bolsena  sites pointed to strong differences in pollution load between sites, with concentration of all pollutants measured being consistently higher in the tissues of silver male eels at the tiber site than in those from the bolsena site , despite a high individual variability. concentrations of pcbs were 6– <dig> times higher at the tiber site but not significantly so using univariate anova. the sum of the  <dig> main pcb congeners  in tissue collected at the tiber site  was also above the italian limit for consumption , while at the bolsena site this value was below the limit . the value of sum  <dig> pcbs at tiber was comparable to the value reported in miniero et al.  <cit>  on eels collected from the urban tract of the river tiber in rome . organochlorine pesticides  were twofold higher in the tissues of silver male eels at the tiber site with significant differences for pp-dde  and pp-ddt . brominated flame retardants  were  <dig> to  <dig> times higher at the tiber site than at the bolsena site, with both polybrominated diphenyl ethers  and hexabromocyclododecane  isomers being highly significant . the tissues collected at the river tiber site also exhibited the highest concentrations for all nine metals measured but differences were not statistically significant due to the high individual variability. however, a multivariate anova conducted on a set of all pollutants combined  indicated statistically significant differences .

univariate and multivariate anovas for equal pollutant bioaccumulation are presented. a multivariate anova was also conducted on a set of all pollutants combined . concentration of pcbs, ocps and bfrs is expressed in ng/g of wet weight. metal concentration is expressed in μg/g of dry weight. dl = below detection limit. * = statistically significant.

gene expression analysis
a european eel-specific microarray of  <dig>  cdnas was generated and used to identify genes involved in response to pollutants by comparing the expression profiles of  <dig> individuals from heavily-polluted  and lowly-polluted  environments. mean concentrations of pollutants were consistently higher at the tiber site, but not all individual measurements. across all  <dig> microarray experiments, only  <dig> probes  did not show a signal higher than the background, while  <dig>   were successful  in at least  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments.

prior to the analysis of differentially expressed genes, a pearson correlation-based heatmap using a subset of  <dig>  genes only partially grouped individuals according to sampling site , which is suggestive of similar environmental conditions. all females were from the same site  and clustered together, which is scarcely informative. however, males and females were well separated. since differences in the expression of sex-linked genes could interfere with the identification of genes involved in response to pollutants, two separate analyses were conducted in parallel  considering only males and  with both males and females included.

a two-unpaired class significance analysis of microarray  test was conducted on normalized data between individuals from the tiber  and bolsena  sites. enforcing a stringent 0% false discovery rate , a total of  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed in the samples from tiber in comparison with the samples from bolsena,  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated. with a less restrictive 5% fdr, a list of  <dig>  probes were differentially expressed in the tiber individuals in comparison with the bolsena individuals,  <dig> over-expressed and  <dig> under-expressed.

a more systematic functional interpretation of the set of differentially expressed genes between sites was obtained by an enrichment analysis in david. using the list of transcripts obtained with the 5% fdr corresponding to  <dig> unique transcripts, a putative match with zebrafish was found for  <dig> transcripts. enrichment analysis showed a total of  <dig> terms, all significantly over-represented in the heavily-polluted tiber site compared to the bolsena site , including  <dig> kegg pathway terms,  <dig> mf-go terms,  <dig> bp-go terms,  <dig> sp-pir  keywords and  <dig> interpro . the genes assigned to the above  <dig> terms are mostly known to be involved in drug metabolism . those included genes encoding several members of the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily of enzymes  that catalyze the oxidation of xenobiotic substances such as pollutants, drugs and toxic elements. a higher number of terms were under-expressed in the individuals from the tiber site in comparison with the individuals from the bolsena site . the assigned genes are mostly known to be involved in energetic metabolism . three kegg pathways were significantly enriched, namely oxidative phosphorylation , gap junction  and rna polymerase .

when repeating the analysis with females from bolsena also included ,  <dig>  transcripts were differentially expressed in the tiber samples in comparison with the bolsena samples using a 5% fdr,  <dig> transcripts over-expressed and  <dig> transcripts under-expressed. enrichment analysis using david confirmed the results obtained with the males dataset and all key genes over-expressed  and under-expressed  in the individuals from tiber were also significantly enriched when females were added to the analysis. unlike gene expression profiles, which were strongly affected by sexes, enrichment analyses did not vary when including females, which suggests that the differentially expressed genes between tiber and bolsena were under-represented among the sub-set of  <dig>  genes used in the pearson correlation-based heatmap.

when correlating gene expression and individual measures of pollutants in sam, a total of  <dig> transcripts were positively correlated  and a total of  <dig> transcripts were negatively correlated . in both cases, the same associations were obtained using either a  <dig>   <dig> or 5% fdr. using the list of positively and negatively correlated transcripts, a putative match with zebrafish was found for  <dig> transcripts to be used in david. a total of  <dig> terms were enriched , but only one term was statistically significant , corresponding to nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain  <dig> and  <dig> genes. no functional annotation clusters or kegg pathways were enriched.

estimation of evolutionary distance of cyp3a genes
our study shows one cyp3a isozyme over-expressed in the tiber samples, with a positive blast hit with zebrafish danio rerio cyp3a <dig>  <cit> , one of the key enzymes involved in the detoxification of xenobiotic substances. estimation of evolutionary distances using pairwise distance  in mega  <dig>  <cit>  showed a genetic distance of  <dig>  between the european eel cyp3a and zebrafish cyp3a <dig>  comparison with other amino acid sequences available in genbank showed slightly higher pairwise genetic distances between the european eel cyp3a and killifish fundulus heteroclitus cyp3a <dig> , medaka oryzias latipes cyp3a <dig>  and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss cyp3a <dig> . by comparison, a higher genetic distance was found between the european eel cyp3a and the human cyp3a <dig> of  <dig> . a neighbour-joining tree comparing those cyp3a isozymes grouped together the european eel and zebrafish cyp3as, separated from the killifish, medaka and rainbow trout, which formed a second group , while the human cyp3a <dig> appeared as the most distant.

discussion
over-expression of detoxification genes
several genes related to metabolism of xenobiotics were upregulated in the highly polluted site  in comparison with the low pollution site , which indicates that their expression is pollutant-related. these include a set of cytochrome p <dig>  genes that were upregulated by 8– <dig> fold in the tiber sample group. the liver cyp enzymes are a superfamily of heme-containing monooxygenases that constitute the principal enzymes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics. the function of most cyps is to catalyze the oxidative and reductive metabolism of xenobiotic substances such as drugs, environmental chemicals and endogenous substrates  <cit> . out of all families, cyp3a isozymes comprise the largest proportion of cyps in the liver. cyp3a isozymes are involved in the first phase of the xenobiotic metabolism by means of introducing reactive or polar groups into the xenobiotics, thus modifying their chemical structure. previous studies have shown that expression of cyp3a isozymes is induced by dioxins  <cit> , pcbs  <cit>  and pbdes  <cit> .

a novel european eel cyp3a gene, upregulated in the highly polluted tiber site, was identified by enrichment analysis and shown to be ortholog to zebrafish danio rerio cyp3a <dig> by phylogenetic analysis. the european eel cyp3a conformed to the specific structural features associated with the family, and despite being a partial sequence, several conserved regions could be identified including a total of four substrate recognition sites . differences in cyp catalytic activities are suggested to be determined by amino acid changes in srs sites  <cit> . in the case of the european eel cyp3a, differences in amino acid sequence between the species in figure  <dig> were predominantly observed in srs <dig>  but not in srs <dig>  or srs <dig> , which agrees with the observations when comparing two cyp3a paralogs in medaka  <cit> .

in addition to xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes involved in the first phase of detoxification, we also identified genes involved in the second phase of the xenobiotic metabolism, particularly glutathione-s-transferase , which was over-expressed by  <dig>  fold in the heavily-polluted tiber site. following addition of reactive functional groups by cyps in phase i, phase ii enzymes catalyze the conjugation of the xenobiotic parent compound or its metabolites with an endogenous ligand, thus facilitating its excretion  <cit> . gsts are a multigene superfamily of dimeric multifunctional enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of metabolites by covalently adding reduced glutathione . based on their biochemical, immunologic and structural properties, gsts are categorized into  <dig> main classes: alpha, mu, pi, and theta. the gene over-expressed in the tiber samples was glutathione s-transferase pi , previously described in many fish species including the european eel . in contrast with phase i enzymes, an increase in gst activity as a response to xenobiotics like the one found in our study in the highly polluted tiber site does not seem to be universal, and while some studies show a higher enzyme activity, others do not observe changes or even report negative results. in this sense, a review of  <dig> laboratory and  <dig> field studies in fish only reported a significant gst increase in 33% of the studies  <cit> . besides biotransformation or metabolic enzymes, many pollutants have been shown to exert toxic effects related to oxidative stress  <cit> . antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , catalase  or glutathione peroxidase  defend the organisms against oxygen toxicity and are critical during the detoxification of radicals to non-reactive molecules. in our study, gpox was upregulated in samples from the highly-polluted tiber site and was included in the two annotated clusters that were significantly enriched. gpox is a peroxidase that plays an important role in protecting membranes from lipid peroxidation damage. the increased gpox activity observed in our study contrasts with the lack of response of gpox to pollution found in most studies. the review of van der oost et al.  <cit>  reported a positive response on gpox in only 14% of field studies, limited to chub squalius cephalus and grey mullet mugil cephalus. regarding other antioxidant enzymes, the european eel platform developed in this study included  <dig> transcripts encoding for sod, only one of which was upregulated in the samples from the tiber site, although not significantly so. no transcripts showing a significant match with cat were included in the platform.

along with detoxification genes, environmental stress has been proposed to induce the synthesis of proteins involved in protection and repair of the cell in response to environmental perturbations, including stress  proteins, metallothioneins and multi-xenobiotic resistance  transmembrane proteins. in particular, metallothioneins constitute a superfamily of proteins involved in the regulation and/or detoxification of a wide variety of metals . however, in our study, metallothioneins were not over-expressed in samples from the highly-polluted tiber site. the european eel array developed in this study included at least  <dig> transcripts encoding metallothioneins, and while most of them  showed a higher expression in tiber than in bolsena samples, differences were not statistically significant. in contrast with our study, a straightforward positive dose–response association to single pollutants for metallothioneins has been documented in experimental studies in european glass eels  <cit> . however, many biotic and abiotic factors can influence gene expression in nature  <cit> , leading to discrepancies between field and experimental studies  <cit> . on the other hand, examination of differences in gene expression between polluted and unpolluted populations of atlantic cod  from western norway using gene expression profiling showed genes related to metal stress including metallothionein to be upregulated in the polluted locations  <cit> , which confirms early experimental results in fish . the recent study of milan et al.  <cit>  on expression profiling in the manila clam ruditapes philippinarum reported four transcripts encoding metallothioneins over-expressed in samples from a highly polluted area. in the same study, up to nine gst-coding transcripts were upregulated in the polluted area.

some of the genes over-expressed in the highly polluted tiber site could be potentially used as genomic markers  for environmental genomics, including the european eel cyp3a gene ortholog to cyp3a <dig> in zebrafish, glutathione-s-transferase and glutathione peroxidase. however, it should be noted that further studies are required to confirm the adequacy of the potential biomarkers identified in our study, including a full characterization of the genes, the analysis of variation across sexes and habitats and the temporal stability of their expression, in order for them to be unequivocally used as valid biomarkers.

pollution is associated with decreased energy production
our results suggest that, together with the induction of detoxification genes, pollution is associated with decreased respiratory activity and energy production. many genes involved in energy metabolism were downregulated in samples from the highly-polluted tiber site, including key enzymes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation , and were grouped in a significantly enriched annotation cluster . the mitochondrial respiratory chain couples electron transfer between electron donors  and acceptors  with the transport of protons  from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, which builds a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane that is used to generate energy in the form of atp. the following genes were all down-regulated in tissues collected from the tiber fish:

 nadh dehydrogenase. this enzyme is a component of complex i of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from nadh to coenzyme q .

 succinate dehydrogenase. this enzyme is part of complex ii of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that catalyzes the conversion from succinate to fumarate and passes electrons to coenzyme q in the same fashion as nadh.

 ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. this enzyme is part of the third complex in the electron transport chain, which catalyzes the oxidation of coenzyme q. electrons are sequentially transferred from coenzyme q to complex iii, and from there to cytochrome c, a water-soluble electron carrier located within the intermembrane space.

 cytochrome c oxidase. this enzyme is part of complex iv of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that receives electrons from cytochrome c and transfers them to oxygen, the most electronegative and terminal electron acceptor in the chain, converting molecular oxygen to two molecules of water. in the process, it translocates four protons across the membrane, establishing a transmembrane proton gradient used by the atp synthase to synthesize energy.

 atp synthase. this enzyme is sometimes referred as complex v of the electron transport chain. the creation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane is used by atp synthase to synthesize atp via oxidative phosphorylation, using the flow of h+ to phosphorylate adp to atp.

in agreement with our study, experimental studies documented a decrease in expression of genes involved in the respiratory chain in response to cadmium exposure and hypoxia in the gills of glass eels  <cit> .

in addition to genes involved in energy metabolism, proteins from two other gene families were downregulated in samples from the highly-polluted tiber site, namely gap junction  and rna polymerase  genes. gap junctions are channels that connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells, allowing ions and small solutes to pass between them. among the postulated roles of gap junction communication are coordination of activities of specific groups of cells, nutrient sharing, regulation of growth and oncogenesis  <cit> , although a connection with pollution does not seem straightforward. on the other hand, the multi-subunited rna polymerases are the main enzymes responsible for gene transcription, which is the process of creating a complementary rna copy of a dna sequence. enriched nodes in our study represented subunits of rna polymerase ii, which catalyzes the transcription of dna to synthesize precursors of messenger rna  but also some non-coding rnas. rna expression is frequently used as a proxy of condition  <cit> , as the amount of ribosomal, messenger and transfer rnas provides information on the metabolic status of the whole organism. thus, the suggested lower rna expression in samples from the highly-polluted site points to a lower metabolic rate in this group of fish.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that pollution affects the condition of eels from a metabolic point of view, seeing that key genes involved in respiratory activity, energy production and rna expression are downregulated in the tiber fish, possibly resulting in a low energetic status of the individuals. although we did not measure metabolism directly, the suggested genome-wide lowered metabolic rate and condition observed in eels at the pre-migrating stage in our study points to a poor quality of spawners that could potentially impair both spawning migration and reproduction in the sargasso sea. given that many river basins across europe are experiencing similar levels of environmental pollution, an impoverished spawning stock could lead to a reduced reproductive success, a lowered effective population size and an impaired evolutionary potential.
