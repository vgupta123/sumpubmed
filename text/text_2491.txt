BACKGROUND
due to its relatively simple cardiac structure, ease of genetic manipulation and conservation of many aspects of cardiac development drosophila is widely used to study specification of cardiac progenitors, cardiomyocyte diversification and differentiation, tubular lumen formation, and as a model for cardiomyopathies . the heart  of drosophila is a linear tube that pumps hemolymph from the posterior of the abdomen towards the head region from where it returns through an open circulatory system. the dorsal vessel is formed in the embryo from bilateral rows of cardioblasts/cardiomyocytes that merge at the dorsal midline where they undergo defined shape changes to form a contractile heart tube with a wide lumen in the posterior ventricular portion  and a narrower lumen in the anterior region . lumen formation has been shown to require adhesion molecules like de-cadherin localized in the junctional  domains of cardiomyocytes as well as molecules of the slit/robo signaling cascade and dystroglycan  that define an adhesion-free zone in the prospective luminal area, called l-domain  <cit> . regulation of the width of the lumen appears to involve the collagen xv/xviii-like molecule multiplexin , which is specifically expressed in the wider heart portion  <cit> .

within the dorsal vessel several functionally distinct cell types are discriminated on the basis of the expression of particular transcription factors and morphological features  <cit> : the myocardial tube contains two types of cardiomyocytes , which are positive for mef <dig> and either tinman   or dorsocross  and seven-up  . the myocardial tube is flanked by several types of mef2-negative non-contractile nephrocyte-like pericardial cells , which are characterized by expression of zfh- <dig> and either odd-skipped , tin  or tin plus even-skipped  . all cell types in the dorsal vessel share expression of the hand gene  <cit> . specialized multinucleated muscles fibers, the so-called alary muscles , connect the dorsal vessel with the epidermis. in the embryo there are seven segmental pairs of org- <dig> expressing ams stretching from the apodemes of the lateral epidermis to the dorsal vessel where they surround pcs, preferentially particular odd-pcs, via delta-shaped extensions  <cit> . the dorsal vessel is embedded in an elaborated extracellular matrix  that is structurally linked to the ams  <cit> . the lumen and the outer  side of the myocardial tube as well as the pcs are covered by a basement membrane   <cit> . an almost unique component of the cardiac ecm is pericardin , a collagen-like molecule that is secreted mainly by pcs, svp-cms as well as the larval fat body and incorporated into the abluminal ecm  <cit> .

while many efforts have been made to complete our knowledge about drosophila cardiogenesis a number of open questions remain. in particular, little is known about genes that guide cardiac morphogenesis or structural components that ensure proper heart function, stability and linkage to other tissues. the specific requirements for am formation and attachment are also not fully understood. one largely unbiased approach to identify genes required for these processes is chemically induced mutagenesis. we have performed a forward genetic screen for chromosome  <dig> using ems as a mutagen and a set of cell type-specific gfp  and rfp  reporters to analyze the development of the embryonic dorsal vessel and its associated alary muscles in parallel with other muscle types. here we present the characteristics of mutants from two identified complementation groups showing similar phenotypes, namely embryonic am detachment and dissociation of pcs, as a predominant feature. in both cases defects are caused by domain-specific point mutations in components of the ecm. the members of the first group were found to contain hypomorphic mutations in laminin b <dig>  encoding the only β chain of drosophila laminins, whereas in the second complementation group the gene cg25c was affected. cg25c  encodes one of the two type iv collagen chains present in drosophila; the other is encoded by the neighboring gene viking   <cit> . although drosophila collagen iv was studied in several developmental contexts, no cardiac-related phenotype has been reported for collagen iv α genes in drosophila prior to this work. collagens are secreted as homo- or heterotrimeric protomers, with genuine type iv collagens predominantly if not exclusively being found as heterotrimers  <cit> . based on the conservation of at least two collagen iv genes in diverse organisms such as drosophila, the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and humans as well as on genetic data it is assumed that drosophila collagen iv is also a heterotrimer consisting of two cg25c-encoded α <dig> chains and one α <dig> chain encoded by vkg, analogous to the most common vertebrate type iv collagen α12α <dig> <cit> . laminins are secreted as heterotrimeric glycoproteins and formed by dimerization of one β chain and one γ chain, followed by addition of an α chain  <cit> . in addition to lanb <dig>  the drosophila genome encodes a single laminin γ gene, lanb <dig>  and two laminin α genes, laminin a  and wing blister , which are related to vertebrate α3/ <dig> and α1/ <dig> and form the heterotrimers laminina and lamininw, respectively  <cit> .

together with nidogen and perlecan , laminin and type iv collagen constitute the core components of bms in all bilaterian organisms, and some of their cell surface receptors such as integrins and dystroglycan are also conserved  <cit> . bms contribute to the normal differentiation, compartmentalization and integrity of many tissues, and certain mutations in their components have been reported in connection with human diseases . in drosophila mutations in laminin-encoding genes have been shown to cause pleiotropic defects in several bm covered organs, including the dorsal vessel, gut, somatic body wall muscles, renal  tubules, trachea, nervous system and wing epithelia  <cit> . we have isolated novel missense alleles of lanb <dig> that have rather limited effects on general embryonic development, but lead to severe defects in the cardiac ecm. furthermore we report collagen iv mutations that result in poor incorporation of perlecan into bms, prominent accumulation of intracellular vkg, and late embryonic cardiac am detachment. the data presented herein underscore the importance of laminin and collagen particularly for the development of cardiac tissues and their lateral connections. our work also identifies amino acid residues critical for this function.

RESULTS
we have screened ems-induced 2nd chromosome mutants for defects in cardiac, somatic and visceral muscles. the mutagenesis was performed in flies carrying tinc*-gfp, org-1-sm-rfp and hlh54f-lvm-rfp reporter genes in order to visualize cardioblasts of the embryonic dorsal vessel, org-1-positive somatic muscles, and longitudinal visceral muscles , respectively. the somatic muscles labeled by org-1-sm-rfp include seven pairs of alary muscles  that are connected with the dorsal vessel via delta-shaped attachments . mutants were divided into several phenotypic classes based on the information obtained from the three reporters. here we focus on a phenotypic class that is characterized by detachment of ams from the dorsal vessel as its primary feature. further genetic analysis allowed us to allocate most of these mutants to two genetically interacting complementation groups that correspond to the laminin β chain-encoding gene lanb <dig> or the type iv collagen-encoding gene cg25c .

isolation of novel ems-induced lanb <dig> alleles
three of the newly isolated lanb <dig> mutants, s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  are characterized by detached ams and an irregular morphology of the dorsal vessel, while muscle fibers in the body wall musculature show only mild defects and visceral muscles are barely affected . in most cases detached ams are first observed at the posterior portion of the heart of stage 16– <dig> embryos. prior to hatching, these embryos usually lose dorsal attachment of almost all ams except for the anterior-most pair that anchors near the lymph gland . org-1-rfp-labeled, alary-related muscles stretching longitudinally through the thorax also maintain anchorage in most embryos. defects in the cardiac tube itself such as twists, stretches of single-rowed cardiomyocyte alignments and occasional breaks are observed increasingly during late development. just prior to eclosion the heart tube appears to lose its anchorage at the posterior end, the ventricle collapses and the entire tube shortens significantly . the described features are present in homozygous embryos of the three lines and in embryos with trans-heterozygous allele combinations .

this relatively specific phenotype, affecting mainly alary muscles and the morphology of the heart tube, is more restricted than the phenotype of strong lanb <dig> alleles also isolated in our screen . the latter also show alary muscle and dorsal vessel defects, but were put into a distinct phenotypic class mainly because of their severe midgut constriction defects and visceral mesoderm phenotypes . lvm fibers can be found in bundles  loosely flanking the unconstricted midgut. lanb <dig> mutants of this group also have more pronounced defects in the heart  and in somatic body wall muscles . altogether the phenotype of the strong lanb <dig> alleles resembles that of previously reported lanb <dig> null mutants  <cit>  and amorphic mutants for the laminin γ chain-encoding lanb <dig> gene . in mutants for the two laminin α chain genes wb  and lana  the same tissues were affected, but milder phenotypes were seen for alary muscles and the lvm, respectively . our ems screen generated at least eight very similarly looking wb alleles, thus both laminin genes located on chromosome  <dig> were hit with similar frequency. the most conspicuous features of wb mutants were, in accordance with previous descriptions, abnormal midgut morphology , variably detached lvm fibers and a partially interrupted myocardial tube . unlike in the strong and weak lanb <dig> mutants described above, am attachment is largely maintained and a recognizable heart lumen appears to be present. in contrast, amorphic lana mutants analyzed with our gfp/rfp marker set exhibit a lanb1-like myocardial phenotype with similar am detachment, but no or very mild midgut and lvm defects .

hypomorphic lanb <dig> mutants with heart defects harbor domain-specific missense mutations
given the distinct phenotypes present in hypomorphic versus strong lanb <dig> alleles we asked whether specific types of mutations are present in each phenotypic class. sequencing of dna from homozygous embryos showed that this is indeed the case. the domain organization of the laminin β chain and the positions of the determined mutations are shown in figure 2a, next to a schematic illustrating the location of the domains within a prototype laminin α/β/γ trimer . strikingly, all hypomorphic lanb <dig> alleles isolated on the basis of a largely heart-restricted phenotype carry point mutations that cluster within the n-terminal ln domain . in lanb1
s0733
 an ems-typical g-to-a transition in codon  <dig> converts an acidic glutamate residue to the basic lysine. in lanb1
s1163
 a g-to-a exchange results in a glycine-to-arginine switch at codon  <dig>  both of these detected amino acid substitutions change conserved residues . in lanb1
s3773
 a t-to-a transversion changes a conserved valine to glutamate in position  <dig>  heteroallelic combinations involving lanb1
s3773
 display slightly milder phenotypes, in which the posterior end of the heart tube remains frequently attached and escapers survive up to early pupal stages. by contrast, lanb1
s0733
 and lanb1
s1163
 mutants or their trans-allelic combinations die during the early first instar.

the high sequence conservation of the ln domain between drosophila and mammals makes it possible to superimpose the affected positions to the known structure of the ln domain of mouse lanb <dig>  the ln domain contains a core of eight β-strands folded into two sheets of a sandwich structure  <cit> . all of the identified changes are located on the same side of this β-sandwich, potentially disturbing the structure of the β6/β3/β <dig> interface . because of their common features and for brevity we refer to these hypomorphic lanb <dig> alleles in the following as lanb1
ln
 mutants.

in contrast to the lanb1
ln
 mutants, the strong and more pleiotropic phenotypes are mostly associated with premature stop codons in lanb <dig>  we found truncations that occur either early within the laminin chain, as in the alleles lanb1
s0212
, lanb1
s2941
 and lanb1
s0473
, or late near the c-terminus, as in lanb1
s1522
 . we do not see significant phenotypic differences between these truncated alleles in either homozygous or hemizygous conditions , which we attribute to the absolute requirement of c-terminal portions for trimer formation and laminin secretion. all of these truncated products would lack a cysteine near the c-terminal end of the coiled-coil region that was shown to form a disulfide bridge with the corresponding region of the laminin γ chain  <cit> . these alleles are therefore most likely functional null alleles. notably, exchange of an intra-molecular disulfide bridge-forming cysteine residue in position  <dig> in the second egf-like repeat to tyrosine also appears to have a severe impact on the functionality of laminin, since lanb1
s0464
 mutants  show strong phenotypes similar to those with lanb <dig> truncations .

mutations in the collagen iv-encoding gene cg25c disturb the connection of alary muscles with the dorsal vessel
a second complementation group originating from mutants with alary muscle detachment is formed by the alleles s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> of cg25c, which encodes one of the two type iv collagens in drosophila. this complementation group was established through analysis of the line s <dig>  which was isolated based on its fully penetrant alary muscle detachment phenotype in stage  <dig> embryos . the cg25c
s3064
 mutant phenotype resembles that of the hypomorphic lanb1
ln
 alleles except for the fact that detachment usually starts later and predominantly with central rather than posterior alary muscles. in cg25c
s3064
/dfexel <dig> embryos, alary muscles begin to detach at about the same time as body wall muscles start to contract and in some cases just around hatching time  . embryos homozygous for the deficiency dfexel <dig>  which deletes both of the drosophila collagen iv genes, cg25c and viking , have an alary muscle phenotype comparable to that of cg25c
s3064
/dfexel <dig>  although with lower penetrance . notably, we also detect alary muscle detachment in homozygotes for the previously reported allele cg25c
dts-l3
  and in cg25c

embryos were analyzed for the position of am attachments at late stage  <dig>  after development at the indicated temperature. embryo half-sides in which at least one of the seven ams showed an increased distance between its dorsal end and the dv were counted as abnormal .

the alleles cg25c
s0791
 and cg25c
s1348
 showed a slightly weaker and not fully penetrant phenotype in homozygous embryos  or in trans-heterozygous embryos containing one copy of the allele over dfexel <dig> or cg25c
s3064
 at our standard screening temperature of 25°c . in addition, the alleles cg25c
s0120
 and cg25c
s2186
, which in homozygous condition show additional features , were found to be lethal with dfexel <dig> and cg25c
s3064
 and semi-lethal with cg25c
k00405
 . while cg25c
s0120
 was also lethal with the weaker alleles cg25c
s0791
 and cg25c
s1348
, the cg25c
s2186
 allele shows nearly complete inter-allelic complementation of lethality in these combinations. this fits with a robust alary muscle detachment phenotype in most cg25c
s0120
/cg25c
s3064
 and cg25c
s0120
/dfexel <dig> embryos, but rare occurrence in the corresponding trans-allelic cg25c

s2186
/cg25c
s3064
 and cg25c
s2186
/dfexel <dig> embryos at 29°c .

in addition to the  interallelic non-complementation among these cg25c alleles we also observed trans-allelic genetic interactions with lanb <dig> alleles. if cg25c
s3064
 is crossed with strong lanb <dig> alleles only 0-30% of the expected non-cy siblings eclosed as adults and from crosses with lanb1
ln
 mutants only 3-40% eclosed. the presence of a second-site mutation in lanb <dig> on the cg25c
s3064
 mutant chromosome was ruled out as an explanation for these results by sequencing of the lanb <dig> locus. furthermore, a similar or slightly milder reduction of viability was observed in crosses of several lanb <dig> ems alleles with cg25c
dts-l3
 and cg25c
s0120
. although trans-heterozygous embryos and early l <dig> larvae with cg25c alleles over the lanb1-deleting deficiency dfed <dig> or lanb1
s0473
 rarely show any significant detachment phenotypes , this observed genetic interaction reinforces the notion that lanb <dig> and cg25c engage in close functional interactions.

temperature-sensitivity of cg25c-related alary muscle detachment phenotypes
since several collagen alleles including cg25c
dts-l3
 were recently reported to be associated with temperature-sensitivity  <cit>  we reinvestigated the alary muscle phenotype and viability in selected genotypes at different temperatures. as noted before, the detachment phenotype was not fully penetrant for some trans-allelic cg25c combinations at our standard temperature of 25°c or below. in agreement with temperature-sensitivity, the frequency of the detachment phenotype is enhanced for all our alleles  at elevated temperature . furthermore, the combinations cg25c
dts-l3
/cg25c
s3064
 and cg25c
s0120
/cg25c
s3064
 are embryonic lethal at 25°c, but if kept at 19°c some animals develop into early l <dig> and l <dig> larvae, respectively. in agreement with the weaker phenotype of cg25c
s0791
, cg25c
s1348
 and cg25c
s2186
, adult escapers were observed for these alleles if combined with cg25c
s3064
  and grown at 19°c, while at 25°c these trans-heterozygotes died either during larval growth or in pupal stages. these data imply that temperature-sensitivity is a more widespread phenomenon of collagen mutations .

molecular identification of ems-induced mutations in cg25c reveals changes in collagen glycine-x-y repeats
sequencing of the loci from the cg25c alleles s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> detected an allele-specific point mutation in each of the five cases. as illustrated in figure 3j all cg25c alleles isolated in our screen contain glycine exchanges originating from g-to-a nucleotide transitions at different positions. glycine residues are abundant in the collagen triple-helix-forming domain as part of the structurally important gly-x-y repeats . surprisingly, cg25c
s3064
 shares its glycine-to-aspartic acid mutation at position  <dig> with the recently published allele cg25c
dts-l3
 <cit> . this allele was characterized as dominant temperature-sensitive in the context of viability, female fertility and oviduct muscle stability  <cit> . the proposed antimorphic features possibly explain the relatively strong alary muscle detachment phenotype of g552d homozygous mutants, which is more penetrant than that of complete collagen iv null mutants exel7022) at 25-29°c . in another strong allele, cg25c
s0120
, the glycine at residue  <dig> is converted into a serine. the milder allele cg25c
s0791
 contains a glycine-to-glutamic acid change at residue  <dig>  a glycine-to-arginine exchange is found at amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the relatively weak alleles cg25c
s1348
 and cg25c
s2186
, respectively.

alary muscle detachment in lanb1
ln
 and cg25c mutants is connected with dissociation of pericardial cells from the dorsal vessel
alary muscles attach to the dorsal vessel through ecm fibers surrounding pcs  <cit>  and mutations in the laminin α and γ chain-encoding genes lana, wb, and lanb <dig> have previously shown to impair cardiac attachment of pcs  <cit> . these data together with initial hints obtained with the tinc*-gfp marker suggested that alary muscles detach together with pcs in cg25c and lanb1
ln
 mutants. juxtaposition of detached dorsal alary muscle endings with pcs could indeed be detected in cg25c and lanb1
ln
 mutants by double-staining of org-1-rfp and the pc marker odd . in contrast, tin-positive pcs were still detectable at their normal position close to cardiomyocytes in both of these mutants at a similar stage . pericardin , a collagen-like molecule secreted in embryos mainly by pcs and normally deposited at the abluminal side of the heart tube  was also dislocated in those mutants . furthermore, prc did not form a contiguous layer around the dorsal vessel suggesting severe problems in the establishment of cardiac ecm structure in the isolated hypomorphic lanb1
ln
 alleles similar to those observed in lanb <dig> null mutants  <cit> . in contrast, no discontinuity in the prc distribution was observed in cg25c
s3064
 embryos except for some lateral spots, which indicate the presence of detached pcs .

in principle wrong positioning of alary muscle endings and pcs could be a consequence of defects in cell migration or pc arrangement. time-lapse studies were performed to address this possibility and to visualize the order of events. an additional reporter, hand-gfp  <cit> , was crossed in for parallel live observation of pcs and alary muscles. in the wild type, dorsal alary muscle endings are clearly visible next to developing pcs and near cardioblasts from stage  <dig> onwards . dorsal alary muscle extensions and pcs closely follow the migration of cardioblast rows towards the dorsal midline . this is not always the case in lanb1
s0733
 mutants where some pcs can be found lagging behind migrating cardioblasts . as contraction of somatic and cardiac muscles initiates, the heart tube loses anchorage and larger gaps between cardiomyocytes and pcs appear, most often beginning from the posterior as described above for alary muscle detachment. eventually single or small groups of pcs are pulled towards lateral locations by retracting alary muscles in all late stage  <dig> lanb1
s0733
 mutant embryos . these data imply that the contracting alary muscles actively contribute to pc dislocation. in order to prove this further we performed similar experiments with double mutants that lack alary muscles. embryos with a null mutation in the org- <dig> gene fail to generate any alary muscles  <cit> . in lanb1
s0733
 embryos that are also mutant for org- <dig> only a small number of lagging pcs was detected during dorsal closure and some pcs were mildly detached after heart tube formation. unlike in lanb1
ln
 single mutants, extreme dislocation of pcs toward the lateral occurs rarely and then only with single cells in the double mutant . similar observations were made in cg25c
s3064
org- <dig> double mutants with the difference that short distance pc detachment was limited to very late stages .

taken together these data demonstrate that the close association of pericardial cells with the myocardial tube is weakened in the isolated mutants and as muscle contraction begins pericardial cells contacted by alary muscles eventually get pulled away.

cardiomyocyte arrangement and polarity in lanb1
ln
 and cg25c mutants
the data imply that the properties of the outer surface of the cardiac tube are critical for pc and alary muscle attachment. hence, the way cardiomyocytes are oriented within the heart tube could be a contributing factor to the observed effects. to get more information about the arrangement and the polarity of cardiomyocytes in lanb1
ln
 and cg25c mutants we performed immunostainings for the myocardial transcription factor mef <dig>  the guidance molecule and polarity marker slit, and the ecm receptor dystroglycan . slit and dg are critical for lumen formation and normally are concentrated at the luminal domain of cardiomyocytes, dg is also present at the abluminal membrane domain, but both molecules are absent from junctional domains of cardiomyocytes .

as already noticed in our observations with tinc*-gfp and hand-gfp, lanb1
ln
 mutants feature occasional gaps or single-rowed stretches of mef2-stained cardiomyocytes  that are accompanied by denser spacing of cells in the remainder of the dorsal vessel. cg25c mutants show almost normal cardiomyocyte alignment. the frequent misalignment of few cardiomyocytes in the posterior heart of cg25c
s3064
 homozygotes  is unlikely to result from the cg25c
s3064
 mutation alone, as it is rarely found in cg25c
dts-l3
 or trans-allelic cg25c
s3064
 combinations .

slit was detected at the luminal side along most of the cardiac tube in lanb1
s0773
 and cg25c
s3064
 mutants, indicating that polarization of cardiomyocytes is not generally disturbed. however, in lanb1
ln
 mutants the luminal slit layer appears to be less regular and interruptions and dislocated patches are observed at positions that show breaks in the cardiac alignment . the condensed arrangement of posterior cardiomyocytes and irregular slit localization suggests that formation of a ventricle with a wide lumen does not occur in these mutants, which is confirmed in co-stainings of hand-gfp with anti-dg antibodies and corresponding luminal cross-sections . areas forming a small lumen alternate with collapsed portions in both parts of the dorsal vessel, ventricle and aorta. furthermore, dg localization at the luminal and even more frequently at the outer domain is interrupted along the anterior-posterior axis in lanb1
s0773
 mutants  suggesting that laminin contributes to dg stabilization.

cg25c mutants essentially look like wild type in mef2/slit and dg stainings, except that the slit signal in the ventricular portion is even less robust than in the wild type . interestingly, multiplexin, a collagen xv/xviii-like molecule specifically expressed in the ventricle, has recently been shown to affect ventricular heart lumen formation by enhancing myocardial slit/robo signaling  <cit> . however, the level of ventricular slit in type iv collagen mutants appears to be sufficient for normal lumen formation .

altogether our data show that even hypomorphic mutations in the laminin β chain can affect the stable arrangement of cardiac cells and lumen formation in the dorsal vessel. in contrast, they do not support a specific function for type iv collagen during establishment of cell polarity or initial steps of lumen formation, although this does not exclude a later function in their maintenance.

a discontinuous ecm layer is formed around the cardiac tube in lanb1
ln
 mutants
the observed embryonic defects of the isolated lanb1
ln
 mutants are more limited than in laminin null mutants in which bm formation in general is severely affected  <cit> . hence, the question arises of which matrix structures are still being established in lanb1
ln
 and cg25c mutants and whether specific defects are seen in or around the dorsal vessel. to answer these questions we investigated the distribution of various ecm components such as laminin, nidogen and perlecan in wild type and mutant embryos. laminin is produced by various mesodermal and ectodermal cells and in the midgut primordia at extended germ band stage or shortly thereafter, but the bulk of laminin deposition is thought to be derived from expression in migrating hemocytes and the fat body at late stages after germ band retraction . a significant amount of cardiac laminin is probably also derived directly from cardioblasts, which express low levels of lanb <dig> mrna . stainings for laminin protein distribution were performed with a nominal anti-lanb <dig> antibody, but this antibody is likely to cross-react with another laminin chain as intracellular staining in hemocytes and in the fat body was observed in lanb1-deficient embryos . in wild-type embryos the lumen and the outer side of the myocardial tube as well as the bms of other organs such as the gut are contiguously stained by this laminin antibody  or by an antibody against nidogen . in contrast, lanb1
s0733
 embryos show only residual and frequently spotty laminin and nidogen localization at the luminal and outer side of the cardiac tube . on the other hand, staining around the gut appears more contiguous almost like in the wild type , which is consistent with the absence of severe morphological changes in this tissue. perlecan incorporation into bms appears to be affected in a similar manner, as it was only partially detected around the heart tube, while being robustly detected around the gut, cns, gonad and malpighian tubules . the prominent presence of bm components around non-cardiac tissues of lanb1
s0733
 mutants demonstrates that this mutated form of lanb <dig> is still able to initiate recruitment of other ecm components. however, formation of a contiguous ecm layer is abolished predominantly around the heart tube in lanb1
s0733
 mutants.

cg25c mutations impair the incorporation of perlecan into basement membranes
consistent with the largely normal pericardin distribution and their milder and later occurring defects, cg25c mutants do not share the severe ecm defects observed in lanb <dig> mutants. a contiguous ecm layer containing laminin and nidogen forms around the heart tube and around other tissues in homozygous cg25c
s3064
 embryos . thus, the glycine exchange g552d does not abolish initial formation of basement membranes, as was observed previously also in dfexel <dig> embryos that lack both type iv collagen genes  <cit> . in spite of this, cg25c mutant embryos feature a very abnormal perlecan distribution. in these mutants, perlecan detectable in form of a gfp-trap fusion protein in live stage  <dig> embryos  or via immunostaining  is incorporated very poorly into the cardiac ecm and basement membranes of other tissues, but is still detected at muscle attachment sites . as shown in figure 8c-f, gfp-perlecan has a rather diffuse distribution in cg25c mutant embryos  and is only faintly detectable in the dorsal vessel and around other tissues . unlike in the wild type, gfp-perlecan can be found in bright speckles within cells scattered throughout the embryo in mutants with the g552d point mutation, either cg25c
s3064
 or cg25c
dts-l3
  or cg25c
s3064
/cg25c
dts-l3
 . based on their location and shape these strong signals very likely represent intracellular accumulations of perlecan in hemocytes, which normally express only low levels of perlecan during late embryogenesis  <cit> . a similar abnormal perlecan distribution was observed in two other glycine mutation alleles , hemizygous mutants  and in the complete absence of both type iv collagen chains in dfexel <dig> embryos , although perlecan accumulation in hemocytes was less prominent in weak alleles and in the hemizygous and null background.

the aberrant accumulation of perlecan in hemocytes points towards a possible role of collagen not only within the extracellular matrix itself, but also for the secretion of particular components. notably, observations made with certain semi-dominant mutant forms of collagen col4a1/a <dig> from caenorhabditis, mice or human patients with vasculature-related diseases such as hemorrhagic stroke led to the suggestion that particular mutations, most often changing the glycine of a gly-x-y repeat, may interfere with the folding and eventually secretion of the heterotrimeric collagen molecule as a whole and may potentially affect also the secretion of other molecules  <cit> . in order to analyze the distribution of the drosophila col4a <dig> homolog vkg in cg25c missense mutants we made use of the gfp protein trap line vkg
g454
, which produces a gfp-tagged version of vkg that is normally incorporated into basement membranes  <cit> . vkg-gfp was detectable at moderate levels in the ecm of the dorsal vessel , in bms of other organs and in hemocytes in live stage  <dig> vkg
g454
/+ control embryos  and in heterozygous lanb <dig> embryos with one copy of the lanb1
s0733
 allele . in heterozygous cg25c embryos that carry one copy the cg25c
g552d
 mutation either in the s <dig>  or dts-l <dig> background  we observed a striking increase of vkg-gfp in hemocytes and very strong signals in the fat body. vkg-gfp was still detectable in basement membranes in most of these embryos, but often only very faintly. similar intracellular vkg-gfp enrichments were also observed in other glycine mutation-carrying cg25c alleles, but not upon simple reduction of cg25c gene dosage with a heterozygous collagen iv gene deletion exel <dig> embryos, data not shown), suggesting that a reduced collagen gene dosage alone cannot be made responsible for vkg-gfp accumulation. even though cg25c/vkg
g454
 genotype combinations do not show morphological defects in embryos, detrimental effects are seen for the alleles with the g552d exchange later on in form of a reduced viability as adults and very poor fertility especially in older females, further supporting the dominant negative nature of cg25c variants with certain glycine exchanges. presence of one copy of these cg25c alleles obviously still allows some normally folded collagen iv to be incorporated into bms at levels sufficient for most developmental processes, but presumably insufficient for full viability, long term muscle integrity and normal oogenesis, a process highly dependent on collagen iv  <cit> . as our data show, collagen plays also a particularly critical role in the attachment of pericardial cells and alary muscles to the dorsal vessel and this function goes beyond its own structural contribution to stability as it serves to promote the incorporation of high levels of perlecan.

in a forward genetic screen we recovered several mutants with a primarily cardiac phenotype featuring alary muscle detachments. mutants belonging to two complementation groups were found to contain domain-specific point mutations in the genes lanb <dig> and cg25c, which encode the laminin β chain and collagen iv α <dig> chain, respectively. laminin and collagen iv are both essential core constituents of bms. their close functional relationship is reflected in the shared primary phenotype of the isolated mutants and in the observed genetic interactions between several mutants of the two complementation groups. interestingly, several alleles of the collagen iv-encoding genes cg25c and vkg obtained in an unrelated ems screen were later found to interact genetically with each other as well as with certain alleles of the laminin a  gene  <cit> . however, these mutants have not been molecularly characterized. although drosophila collagen iv was studied in the context of several developmental questions, no cardiac-related phenotype has been reported for collagen iv α genes in drosophila prior to this work. the role of laminin during embryonic cardiogenesis was investigated to some extent using functional null alleles  <cit> . unbiased screening of a large number of ems mutants allowed us to identify a set of hypomorphic mutations in lanb <dig> that are located in the coding region for the ln domain. mutations within the human lamb <dig> gene are a cause of pierson syndrome, and while most of those mutations result in premature stop codons and thus can be considered amorphic, the few nonsense mutations found so far also cluster in this domain, underlining its functional importance discussed below  <cit> .

distinct functions of laminin and collagen in ecm assembly
the severity of cardiac defects, the timing of alary muscle and pericardial cell detachment and the extent to which ecm components are incorporated into the cardiac ecm are consistent with the widely accepted view that laminin is the first ecm component to assemble and that the collagen network will follow thereafter. drosophila embryos devoid of functional laminin trimers due to an amorphic β or γ chain mutation fail to assemble collagen as well as perlecan and nidogen into a dense bm at various tissues  <cit> . accordingly, mammalian collagen iv was shown to depend on polymerized laminin for its bm incorporation, binding mostly in an indirect way to laminin by using nidogen as a bridge  <cit> . the interrupted arrangement of laminin, nidogen and prc around the myocardial tube of lanb1
ln
 embryos implies that cardiac ecm assembly can initiate, but many of those primal areas fail to expand or do not get sufficiently linked in order to persist. in contrast, there is a largely normal layer with basic bm components formed in embryos with the cg25c
s3064
 mutation or without any collagen iv . regular assembly of laminin and nidogen was previously also detected in larval wing imaginal discs upon rnai-mediated knockdown of cg25c <cit> . on the other hand, the latter approach showed a requirement of collagen iv for perlecan incorporation into the imaginal disc bm, which is akin to our observations in cg25c mutant embryos, in particular regarding the cardiac ecm. in conclusion, collagen iv is not required for the initial steps of cardiac bm assembly in drosophila but for its reinforcement. similar conclusions have been drawn from studies in other contexts and organisms, e.g. in collagen iv α1/α2-deficient mice  <cit> .

polymerization among laminin heterotrimers is mediated via the laminin ln domain located on the short arm of each chain , but the molecular details of this process are still unclear  <cit> . a mutation located in the loop at the tip of the mouse β <dig> ln domain corresponding to pierson syndrome mutation s80r was shown to abolish polymerization in vitro  <cit> . since lanb1
ln
 unlike lanb <dig> null mutants display no general loss of bm, but a deteriorating am/cardiac phenotype during late embryonic stages, we propose that the identified hypomorphic ln mutations, which are conspicuously clustered on one side of the domain , significantly weaken the intermolecular interaction with at least one of the other short arms, thus preventing the formation of a stable hexagonal laminin network. alternatively or in addition, binding to other ecm factors could be altered by these mutations.

supplemented by extensive in vitro studies the sum of the current data suggests a model of stepwise bm assembly  <cit> , which in its essence is also applicable to cardiac ecm in drosophila. first, laminin binds to cell surfaces via its α chain c-terminal globular domains that are able to interact with sulfated glycolipids, integrins and dystroglycan. laminin then polymerizes through its n-terminal ln domains and the formed laminin network serves as a scaffold for direct or nidogen-mediated collagen iv binding. the current model for mammalian bm assembly also includes a feedback towards the cell mediated by binding of the α chain ln domain to integrins or other integral membrane components  <cit> . bms are further modified by addition of perlecan and other molecules, some of which might be tissue specific and require additional factors.

particular importance of laminin and collagen iv in the ecm of the drosophila dorsal vessel
a weakened ecm around the myocardial tube, although with differences in the molecular details, is ultimately responsible for the closely linked detachment of pcs and ams in cg25c and lanb1
ln
 mutants. because of this prominent cardiac phenotype the isolated mutations should have an impact on certain properties that are more or less specific to the cardiac emc. one rather simple assumption is that the heart is very sensitive to changes in ecm core components because of its particular structure and function. the dorsal vessel is devoted to pump at high frequency and therefore demands a sturdy, yet highly elastic ecm and a flexible link to associated cells such as pcs and ams. we have demonstrated that pulling forces from ams contribute to the detachment and long-range dislocation of pcs from the dorsal vessel, which identifies the ecm between the pcs and cbs as the weakest link. ultrastructural and immunohistological studies have demonstrated that the dorsal endings of the ams surround pcs and connect to myocardial cells in an indirect way via an ecm fiber network, which contains pericardin  as a specific component  <cit> . prc has some homology to collagen iv, but its gly-x-y repeats in the triple helix-forming domain are more frequently interrupted and preceded by a region with unique atypical repeats  <cit> . at the current time it is not known whether the different type iv-like collagens, genuine type iv α protomers and the atypical prc, assemble into mixed multimers. incorporation of prc into the cardiac ecm requires the product of the gene lonely heart , a secreted protein of the adamts-like protein family  <cit> . however, a failure to interact with prc alone cannot explain our embryonic am detachment phenotypes because prc mutant embryos still posses attached ams  and cardiac defects of prc as well as of loh mutants develop later during postembryonic stages  <cit> .

interestingly, the detachment phenotypes reported herein are very similar to the so-called “broken hearted”  phenotype, which was described in association with mutants of several genes encoding septate junction proteins, factors thought to regulate them, or factors involved in vesicle traffic  <cit> . these phenotypic similarities could perhaps point to a mechanistic connection between factors encoded by the bro genes and core components of the cardiac bm.

another possible mechanism by which mutations in ubiquitous bm components may lead to specific defects is a disturbed interaction with differentially expressed cell surface receptors. drosophila laminins can bind to integrins, dystroglycan  and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan , and particular integrins are also known to interact with collagens at least in mammals . in drosophila, reported genetic interactions between laminin- and integrin-encoding genes, between vkg and αps <dig> integrin/scab, as well as between sdc and lana or wb support the notion of functional relationships between bm and integral membrane components  <cit> . notably, integrins display complex differential expression patterns, while existence of tissue-specific splice variants was documented in the case of dg  <cit> . integrins are formed by one of five different α subunits  and one of two β subunits . laminina can bind to αps1/βps  and αps3/βps , and lamininw can bind to αps2/βps  as well as to αps3/βps  <cit> . these differences in integrin binding may lead to distinct phenotypes in lanb1
ln
 mutants, depending on whether laminina or lamininw function is more affected and whether redundancy exists in a particular connection.

characteristics of cg25c mutations and their implications for development and human diseases
the newly isolated cg25c mutants all contained mutations resulting in glycine changes in one of the gly-x-y repeats of the collagen triple helix-forming domain. the identification of functionally important glycine residues within the collagen iv α <dig> chain adds to the growing evidence that certain collagen mutations may exert a semi-dominant effect leading to an overall weakening of ecm structures and intracellular accumulation of the collagen protomer and other molecules, both of which could contribute to collagen-related diseases including vascular and cardiac abnormalities  <cit> .

according to in vitro studies and observations originally made on the fibrillar type i collagen, glycine mutations in the gly-x-y repeats are expected to inhibit folding and stability of the triple-helical structure, promote excessive modifications and hinder collagen protomer secretion  <cit> . the cg25c mutants differ in the severity of their phenotype and their ability to reduce viability in trans with the lanb <dig> alleles. the strongest cg25c alleles, cg25c
s3064
 and the recently described cg25c
dts-l3
 mutant, which carry the same g552d mutation, showed genetic interaction with vkg
01209
 and all our lanb <dig> ems alleles, but not with any of the eight laminin α <dig> /wb alleles that were also isolated in the screen. the identity of the mutations in these two independent lines appears highly coincidental but may highlight a particularly critical residue, especially as this mutation shows characteristics of a temperature-sensitive antimorph  <cit> . non-random occurrence of glycine mutations after ems mutagenesis screens were also noticed in the α <dig>  and α <dig>  collagen iv genes of caenorhabditis elegans <cit> . like in our case, several of these mutations were described as semi-dominant temperature-sensitive. a visible defect of these mutants was detachment of muscle fibers from the hypodermis at about the same stage as muscles start to contract. similar body wall muscle detachments have been observed in drosophila after forced expression of a dominant-negative cg25c transgene with an internal deletion in the triple helical region  <cit> . in contrast to this artificially generated version, our cg25c ems alleles and the cg25c- and vkg-deleting deficiency exel <dig> do not show significant defects in the body wall musculature until final stages of embryonic development. at later stages, heterozygous cg25c
dts-l <dig> 
/+ animals show aberrations in the sarcomeric ultrastructure of larval body wall muscles and in the adult oviduct musculature if grown at 29°c, thus arguing for a function of cg25c in maintaining the integrity of several muscle types  <cit> .

dominant phenotypes that are stronger in point mutants than in null mutants suggest that the aberrant collagen chain interferes with the function of other molecules, e.g. by reducing the export of vkg. this would explain the changes in vkg-gfp distribution in heterozygous cg25c
s3064
/+ and cg25c
s0120
/+ embryos, which feature weaker signals in bms and strongly increased vkg-gfp within cells of the fat body and in hemocytes. in another study, rnai-mediated knockdown of cg25c in the larval fat body caused diffuse accumulation of vkg-gfp in the hemolymph and prevented its deposition into bms, indicating that, in the absence of cg25c, vkg is secreted to the hemolymph in nonfunctional monomeric form  <cit> . intracellular accumulation of type iv collagen and concomitant decrease of bm-localized collagen was detected in caenorhabditis mutants carrying glycine substitutions in their collagen chains, in particular at elevated temperature  <cit> . similar negative effects on collagen iv secretion have also been demonstrated in homozygous or heterozygous col1a mutant mice with a short internal deletion in the triple helix-forming domain, which additionally was accompanied by an increase in several endoplasmic reticulum -resident proteins  <cit> . this suggests that semi-dominant forms of collagen could also affect the secretion of other molecules, which would be consistent with our detection of high levels of perlecan-gfp in hemocytes of strong cg25c mutants. this does not exclude the suggested extracellular role of collagen iv for perlecan bm localization, since diffuse distribution of perlecan-gfp throughout the embryo and hardly any bm incorporation were observed in collagen iv-deficient embryos. considering the dramatic increase of vkg-gfp in embryos heterozygous for strong glycine mutation alleles of cg25c, we cannot rule out that this accumulation is connected to a net increase in collagen chain synthesis due some a feedback mechanism induced by misfolded matrix components or monomeric vkg either directly within the er or via an unknown signaling mechanism from the extracellular space.

type iv collagen mutations, most of them causing glycine changes in gly-x-y motifs, were also found in human col4a <dig> and with lesser frequency in col4a <dig> in connection with various diseases such as porencephaly, hemorrhagic stroke, small vessel disease and the hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps  syndrome  <cit> . the molecular mechanism underlying these diseases is still a matter of debate and may depend on the particular allele. in some cases intracellular accumulation of collagen iv and induction of er stress were demonstrated, while other data point towards specific dominant-negative interactions within the ecm  <cit> . further work is required in order to fully understand the mechanisms by which collagen mutations interfere with normal development and tissue integrity.

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation of randomly induced point mutations in genes encoding core basement membrane components demonstrates that the dorsal vessel and its linkage to pericardial cells and alary muscle fibers are highly dependent on a perfectly assembled ecm. pulling forces from alary muscles contribute to the detachment and long-range dislocation of pericardial cells from the dorsal vessel in which the ecm has been weakened by mutations affecting ecm components. mutations can weaken the ecm around the myocardial tube by different mechanisms. our phenotypic analyses support current models of stepwise basement membrane assembly, in which laminin plays a primary role, whereas collagen iv is needed for the stabilization of ecm structures. accordingly, amorphic mutations in genes encoding unique laminin chains , which do not permit the production of functional laminin heterotrimers, will abolish initiation of basement membrane formation and therefore will cause more pleiotropic phenotypes. isolation of a set of clustered hypomorphic mutations in lanb <dig> suggests that the laminin β ln domain is particularly crucial for formation of a contiguous ecm around and within the heart and therefore for myocardial lumen formation, myocardial tube stability and attachment of pericardial cells and alary muscles. we suggest that in these lanb1
ln
 mutants laminin polymerization is impaired due to the amino acid substitutions at the β6/β3/β <dig> interface of the ln domain. the lana  short arm is a likely binding partner of this interface, since loss of lana causes a phenotype similar to that of lanb1
ln
 mutants . wb/α <dig> -containing lamininw molecules may partially allow ecm assembly in some non-cardiac tissues, possibly due to different requirements for laminin network formation and differential receptor binding.

our ems screen revealed that cg25c encoding the type iv collagen α <dig> chain is vital for a stable attachment of pericardial cells and alary muscles to the dorsal vessel. collagen iv ensures normal incorporation of perlecan into embryonic basement membranes and this function also applies to the more elaborated ecm of the dorsal vessel. mutations causing exchanges of glycine in certain gly-x-y repeats of the collagen iv triple helix-forming domain may exert a semi-dominant effect leading to less stable ecm structures as well as intracellular accumulation of collagen and possibly other molecules, thus paralleling observations made in other organisms and in connection with collagen-related diseases. the detected temperature-sensitivity of the phenotypes in our cg25c ems mutants fits well with observations in other organisms, reinforcing the idea that this is a rather widespread phenomenon of collagen glycine mutations.
