BACKGROUND
early embryonic development in mammals begins in transcriptional silence  <cit>  with an oocyte-mediated transcriptional reprogramming of parental gametes occurring during an across-the-board process of “erase-and-rebuild”  <cit> . in this process, the parental transcription programs are erased long before  or soon after  fertilization to generate a relatively naïve zygotic chromatin upon which the transcription program of a new life cycle is rebuilt de novo after activation of the zygotic genome  <cit> . any perturbation in this process will result in ill or fatal transcriptional phenotypes of the resultant embryos  <cit> . the very few viable clones obtained at the end of a typical cloning experiment underscore that substantial differences exist between transcriptional reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei and gametes  <cit> .

six microarray studies have been carried out to explore the transcriptomic profiles of cloned  vs. fertilized  bovine blastocysts  and all reported extensive transcriptional reprogramming of the donor cells by the blastocyst stage with few genes, even as low as twenty  <cit> , being deregulated in scnt embryos. conversely, numerous studies have reported abnormal patterns of dna-methylation and histone acetylation/methylation of bovine clones . these studies concluded that bovine scnt embryos suffer from genome-wide hypermethylation, associated with elevated heterochromatic histone methylation  and h3k <dig> acetylation in the trophectoderm layer. therefore, a typical scnt embryo may be transcriptionally close to , but epigenetically far from , normal embryos, demonstrating that epigenetic but not expression barriers limit reprogramming efficiency  <cit> . accordingly, it would be interesting to determine how small transcriptional aberrations translate into broad epigenetic anomalies or vice versa.

somatic cell chromatin is compact and static, due to the tight association of chromatin with heterochromatin binding proteins and of histones with chromatin. proper erasure of these epigenotype markers is essential for chromatin remodeling and pluripotency, as restricting the exchange of these chromatin factors makes the chromatin inaccessible to oocyte reprogramming factors  <cit> . the short duration and compromised efficiency of the erasure process is considered to be the main cause of the transcriptomic and epigenomic anomalies of cloned embryos  <cit> . to circumvent this problem, assisted epigenetic modification of somatic cells, before and/or soon after scnt, with dna-methyltransferase  and histone deacetylase  inhibitors has been recently used to assist the endogenous epigenome-modifying machinery and enhance the speed and extent of nuclear reprogramming . among these, members of the hydroxamic acid-containing class of hdaci such as trichostatin a  and scriptaid are used more frequently due to their potent effects on global acetylation. given the genome-wide effects of hdaci, increased acetylation results in the increased chromatin relaxation at locations that are associated with pluripotency, and this is expected to provide a chromatin conformation more permissive to transcriptional activation  <cit> .

treatment with tsa improved the development of scnt bovine  and pig  <cit>  embryos to the blastocyst stage. in mice, tsa improved both nuclear remodeling  <cit>  and development to term . treatment with tsa also induced a parallel increase in histone acetylation, chromosome decondensation and nuclear volume in scnt mouse embryos similar to that observed in icsi-derived embryos  <cit> . importantly, through analysis of chromatin remodeling and 5-bromouridine 5′-triphosphate -labeled rna, bui et al.  <cit>  and vanthuan et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a more effective formation of dna replication complexes in tsa and scriptaid treated embryos which was evident by enhanced levels of newly synthesized rna and a significant reduction in asymmetric expression of nascent rna. notably, a positive correlation between the increase in nascent rna synthesis and full-term development of cloned mice was observed. in cloned pig embryos, whitworth et al.  <cit>  reported that scriptaid treatment significantly affected the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts evaluated and returned three of them to levels observed in in vivo-derived embryos. even though a single defect in transcription reprogramming may cause a “ripple” effect resulting in the aberrant expression of entire networks of downstream target genes  <cit> , the analysis of a small number of transcripts is of limited value for the systematic study of the genetic interactions involved in a complex trait. post genomic era approaches, including genome wide analyses and network investigations, are needed.

this is the first study that seeks to assess the effects of assisted epigenetic modifications on transcriptional profiles of bovine scnt embryos with a complete embryo rnaseq-derived microarray which includes splice and 3′utr variants  <cit> . to investigate the potential meaning of the alteration of specific genes or categories of genes, we also attempted to associate specific mechanisms or events that occur in somatic cells, reconstituted oocytes and developing embryos with the observed alterations. since no study has examined the effects of hdac inhibitors on transcriptome and associated events, our results will expand the knowledge in this enigmatic field.

RESULTS
tsa treatment improves in vitro, but not in vivo, developmental competence of scnt bovine embryos
the custom in vitro measure of cloning efficiency is the yield and quality of blastocyst formation  <cit> . in our results , cleavage rate was not significantly different between the groups. however, tsa treatment boosted blastocyst development to a rate that was significantly higher than ctr-nt, but not ivf . development to grade  <dig> &  <dig> blastocyst was not different between tsa-nt and ivf  but significantly less in ctr-nt  compared to tsa-nt. differential staining of blastocysts  revealed a comparable total cell number between the groups. however, tsa treatment, but not the embryo production method, changed the distribution of cells in blastocysts as the proportion of cells allocated to the icm and icm/tcn proportion, were both significantly higher in tsa-nt blastocysts compared to ctr-nt embryos.

the ultimate readout of cloning efficiency is the ability of scnt embryos to develop into viable offspring  <cit> . although numbers are low, the transfer of grade  <dig> &  <dig> blastocysts resulted in comparable early  pregnancy rates between the groups . however, total percentages of pregnancy loss between critical pregnancy days 60– <dig> were high for both nt groups with no beneficial effect of tsa treatment when compared to no failure in ivf pregnancies. in addition, a number of pregnancies from scnt in both groups were terminated at days 100– <dig> due to excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid  and other complications . elective c-section was performed between days  <dig> to  <dig> of pregnancy resulted in the delivery of  <dig> ctr-nt and  <dig> tsa-nt calves. four ctr-nt claves and one tsa-nt calve did not survive. the deceased calves suffered from placental abnormalities including placental hypertrophy and small numbers of larger placentomes.

tsa treatment, not the scnt process, is the greatest source of variation at the transcriptome level
significance analysis of microarray  of blastocysts revealed that out of the  <dig>  targeted gene transcripts represented on the microarray slide, a relatively small number of genes were differentially expressed  in ctr-nt  and tsa-nt  embryos compared to ivf  . of the degs identified,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> and  <dig> genes were downregulated in ctr-nt and tsa-nt embryos, respectively. the identity and description of top molecules and each differentially expressed transcripts in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> and additional file 3: table s <dig>  respectively. comparisons between genes commonly upregulated or downregulated between ctr-nt and tsa-nt embryos revealed that approximately almost all of the downregulated genes in either group, half of the upregulated genes in ctr-nt, and one third of the upregulated genes in the tsa-nt group were common. notably, no upregulated gene in one scnt group was downregulated in the other group and vice versa .fig.  <dig> microarray graphical results. a overview of differential gene expression in ctr-nt and tsa-nt day  <dig> blastocysts compared to ivf counterparts. the total number of differentially regulated genes which comprised the total number of upregulated and downregulated genes is shown by directions of arrows. the venn diagram shows the overlap between deregulated genes in both scnt groups. b venn diagram illustration of the overlap between genes predominantly and exclusively expressed in ctr-nt, tsa-nt and ivf -derived blastocysts. c two-dimensional principal component analysis  indicating the source of variation in the overall transcriptional profiles of ctr-nt vs. ivf and tsa-nt vs. ivf in this study with the transcriptional profile of in vivo blastocysts obtained from the study of gad et al.  using the same array platform



owing to the similarities between ctr-nt and tsa-nt array results, it was interesting to define the probe sets exclusively expressed in the blastocysts of either group. out of the  <dig>  targeted gene transcripts on the microarray slide,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets had a signal higher than the summation of background intensity plus two times the sd of background, indicating the unique presence of the mrna for these genes in ctr-nt, tsa-nt, and ivf embryos, respectively . from this list, hdac <dig> and fzd <dig> were expressed in ct-nt; wnt9b, tet <dig>  fzd <dig>  igf1r, stat <dig>  and h2afy <dig> were expressed in tsa-nt; and xist, elk <dig>  fzd <dig>  notch <dig>  pde3a, kdm2b, and foxo <dig> were expressed in ivf embryos.

tsa does not correct specific transcriptional errors of scnt in bovine
to investigate the possibility of reprogramming error hotspots, the chromosomal distribution of deregulated genes was reviewed to identify gene loci preferentially affected in both groups. chromosomal map view of deregulated genes revealed a high degree of consistency between ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts . the upregulated genes were evenly distributed while chromosome  <dig>  contained a higher number of deregulated genes. a bias in the distribution of downregulated genes was observed with as many as 15 % of the transcripts in both scnt groups from genes located on chromosome x  .fig.  <dig> temporal and spatial map views of degs in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts. a chromosomal distribution of differentially expressed genes in ctr-nt  and tsa-nt  -derived blastocysts. b & c breakdown of degs on chromosome  <dig>  and x  based on their location maps in ensembl data base . the red and blue graphs represent the number of protein-coding genes and short non-coding genes in area, respectively. the black line graphs represent the number of repeat sequences and the red graphs represent gc percentages. the red and green circles represent upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, in ctr-nt and tsa-nt-blastocysts. the magnified panels are to better show the genes located in these chromosomal regions



in order to decipher the location and proportion of genes that could be related to this conflict, the whole transcriptome patterns of both groups were viewed for a direct comparison on the same graph . analysis of microarrays using 5 % fdr and at least  <dig>  fold changes  revealed that genes with fc ≤  <dig>  and fc ≤ − <dig>  had the greatest and lowest similarities between both groups, respectively; whereas genes with − <dig>  ≥ fc ≤ <dig>   were the source of greatest variation between the two groups. figure 3b and c represent the overall top degs similarly upregulated and downregulated in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts, respectively.fig.  <dig> the convergence and divergence between ctr-nt and tsa-nt transcriptomes. a direct comparison between total array results of both scnt groups. all genes were identified for direct comparison with reference to ctr-nt array. b & c overlaps between top degs that were upregulated  and downregulated  in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts



even if the tsa-nt blastocysts were transcriptionally different from the ivf blastocysts, our previous study, using the same platform, revealed a great divergence between the transcriptomes of in vitro- and in vivo-derived bovine blastocysts  <cit> . this led us to determine whether the divergence observed between tsa-nt vs. ctr-nt and ivf could be related to the effect of tsa treatment on the correction of genes commonly deregulated in ctr-nt and ivf embryos. principal component analysis  comparison between the transcriptomes of ctr-nt vs. ivf, tsa-nt vs. ivf in the present study with in vivo blastocysts  clustered the in vivo blastocysts away from the other groups, indicating a divergence between tsa-nt and in vivo blastocysts at the transcriptome level . among the genes that were considered deregulated in ctr-nt and tsa-nt compared to ivf,  <dig> and  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> and  <dig> downregulated genes had closer expression levels to in vivo embryos, respectively .

wnt and fgf canonical pathways are similarly affected in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts
the core pluripotency triad  was similarly affected in both nt groups: oct <dig> was upregulated, nanog was downregulated, and sox <dig> expression was similarly expressed compared to ivf. treatment with tsa did not change the expression of oct <dig> and sox <dig> and resulted in further downregulation of nanog . a reference diagram showing the interactions of five canonical pathways with oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog  was used to extrapolate the possible pathways that could lead to the observed expression patterns of the genes of the core pluripotency triad . examination of genes involved in different canonical pathways revealed that the transcripts for the cytoplasmic mediators of the fgf pathway: pi3k, mek1/ <dig>  were not functionally expressed in the scnt groups; whereas a few isotypes of the nuclear mediators akt, erk1/ <dig>  were upregulated. wnt appeared not functional at upstream regulators and destructive complexes of β-catenin: pp2a, axin, gsk <dig>  apc, were not in an active state to trigger β-catenin cytoplasmic ubiquitination, and correspondingly, β-catenin transcripts were apparently free to be shuttled into the nucleus in an upregulated form. tgf-β and bmp were in a repressed state as their upstream and downstream regulators were almost downregulated or not significantly expressed compared to ivf. notably, a bias was observed in the expression of smads between the nt groups: smad <dig> and  <dig> were both downregulated in ctr-nt while smad <dig> was downregulated in tsa-nt. the expression pattern of the notch signaling pathway was similar between the groups with the exception of notch <dig> which was downregulated in ctr-nt but not in tsa-nt blastocysts.fig.  <dig> signaling pathways in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts. overview of expression pattern of genes involved in esc pluripotency and differentiation in the ctr-nt and tsa-nt array results. each gene can be upregulated, downregulated, or of no-significant expression based on its color in red, green, and gray, respectively. each gene represents the expression level in both nt groups, the right half of each gene symbol represents expression level in tsa-nt and the left half represents the expression level in ctr-nt embryos



tsa effects on epigenetic alterations do not recapitulate changes in chromatin remodeling, epigenetic gene expression, and oct <dig> and nascent mrna expression
the heart of cellular reprogramming is epigenetic modifications and it has been suggested that epigenetic modifiers such as tsa have a carryover effect on a wide variety of epigenetic cellular characteristics  <cit> . to investigate the potential meaning of the alteration of the expression of specific genes or categories of genes, we attempted to determine whether these alterations in gene expression were associated with specific mechanisms or events that occur in somatic cells, reconstituted oocytes and developing embryos.

epigenetic marks
flow cytometry analysis revealed that the tsa treatment significantly increased h3k <dig> acetylation  but had no measurable effect on dna-methylation  in fibroblasts compared to untreated cells. epifluorescent microscopy analysis of blastocysts  detected the highest and lowest levels of dna-methylation in ctr-nt and ivf embryos . although tsa treatment significantly decreased dna-methylation  compared to ctr-nt, this level of dna-methylation was still significantly higher than in ivf embryos. the mean intensity of h3k <dig> acetylation in ivf embryos was significantly higher than in both nt groups and that of tsa-nt significantly higher than ctr-nt .fig.  <dig>

immunofluorescence staining of the reconstituted oocytes showed a marked effect of tsa treatment on the profile of 5mc disappearance and 5hmc generation that is best viewed in fig.  <dig> . the peak of 5mc in ctr-nt oocytes was observed immediately following scnt and a very faint 5hmc was also observed. subsequently, 5mc gradually disappeared concomitantly with the appearance of 5hmc. the exception was a significant drop of 5hmc at 12 h post-reconstitution , which corresponds to the time of dna synthesis  <cit> . however, tsa-treated fibroblasts contained less than half of the 5mc and approximately 4-fold more of the 5hmc signals compared to what was initially observed in the ctr-nt reconstituted counterparts . apart from this initial difference and despite the gradual pattern of 5mc disappearance in tsa-nt oocytes, the 5mc signals that were observed at  <dig> hpr were very similar between tsa-nt and ctr-nt reconstituted oocytes . the initial higher intensity of 5hmc signals in tsa-nt compared to ctr-nt was also observed at the subsequent stages of assessment.fig.  <dig> epigenetic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling in reconstituted oocytes. a1-a’ <dig> stepwise pattern of 5mc at different intervals  in ctr-nt  and tsa-nt . b comparison between intensity levels of 5mc at different intervals  in ctr-nt  and tsa-nt . c1-c’ <dig> stepwise pattern of 5hmc at different intervals  in ctr-nt  and tsa-nt . d comparison between intensity levels of 5hmc at different intervals  in ctr-nt  and tsa-nt . e1-e <dig> stepwise pattern of nuclear remodeling pictured from  <dig>  to 24 h post reconstitution. the merged images of microtubule and nuclear immunostaining have been shown. e <dig> the very sign of nuclear swelling without spindle formation, e <dig> nuclear remodeling without spindle formation, e <dig> premature chromosome condensation with developing spindles, e <dig> single pronucleus completely developed with an early scnt zygote,) first mitotic division of the newly developed scnt zygote. bars with different letters differ significantly at p <  <dig> . scale bar represents 100 μm



chromatin remodeling
the kinetics of nuclear remodeling was quite comparable between ctr-nt and tsa-nt reconstituted oocytes . at  <dig> hpr, the majority of the nuclei were still intact with only minor signs of bipolar spindle formation. at  <dig> hpr, the overall incidence rates of nuclear remodeling were not different between the groups. irrespective of tsa treatment, the majority of the reconstituted oocytes had prematurely condensed chromosomes on well-structured bipolar spindles. at  <dig> hpr, the majority of the reconstituted oocytes had a single pronucleus which condensed into two sets of chromosomes in the newly developing blastomeres at  <dig> hpr.

nascent mrna expression
neither embryo production method nor the tsa treatment affected nascent mrna production. moreover, all the embryos had early signs of nascent mrna production on day  <dig> when they had at least  <dig> cells. from the 16-cell stage onward, clear signs of nascent mrna production were observed in the embryos of both nt groups .

further confirmation of the null effect of tsa on nascent mrna expression was obtained by using nt embryos reconstituted with fibroblasts carrying the oct <dig> promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein  . irrespective of tsa treatment, egfp signals, indicative of oct <dig> gene activation, were not observed until the embryos reached the morulae stage. all the blastocysts emitted clear egfp signals  and the mean intensities of egfp fluorescence were not significantly different between ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts .fig.  <dig> egfp expression in scnt embryos harboring egfp-oct <dig> promoter observed under normal light , and 557 nm excitation of uv filter . comparative egf-oct <dig> expression between crt-nt and tsa-nt embryos at three different stages of in vitro embryo development . bars with different letters differ significantly at p <  <dig> . scale bar represents 100 μm



epigenetic gene expression
examination of genes involved in epigenetic regulation of pluripotency revealed that among genes involved in de novo dna-methylation, dnmt <dig> a & b were upregulated and hells was downregulated in both nt groups compared to ivf embryos. among genes involved in safeguarding epigenetic permissiveness of pluripotency, jarid <dig> was downregulated in both nt groups, cdyl was downregulated in tsa-nt and cdyl <dig> was upregulated in ctr-nt groups .fig.  <dig> epigenetic landscape in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts. overview of the crosstalk between pluripotency factors and epigenetic modifiers in the ctr-nt and tsa-nt array results. genes located in the chain are esc safeguard genes, and genes located in the ramp are differentiating factors. jmjd1c and jmjd1a work through inhibiting the h3k9me2& <dig> which are also differentiation factors. each gene represents the expression level in both nt groups, the right half represents expression level in tsa-nt and the left half represents the expression level in ctr-nt embryos



functional classification and pathway analysis
ontological classification of differentially downregulated genes using ipa generated several biological processes including cell death and survival, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cancer, as well as embryo development as the most significant functions similarly affected in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts . however, biological processes emerging from differentially upregulated genes were different between ctr-nt and tsa-nt groups. cellular assembly and organization were the biological functions most significantly affected in ctr-nt blastocysts with upregulation of the highest number of genes. for tsa-nt-derived blastocysts, cell growth and proliferation, carbohydrate metabolism and molecular transport were the biological functions most significantly affected with upregulation of the highest number of genes.

ipa clustered different top canonical pathways for each group with ratios ranging from  <dig> to 22 %  at p-value <  <dig> . aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling and glutathione-mediated detoxification in ctr-nt, and eif <dig> signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction in tsa-nt were the most dominant canonical pathways revealed.

the ipa was also queried for the identification of the gene regulatory networks  between genes that were either commonly or predominantly expressed in both nt groups . the myc-associated regulatory pathway was the dominant pathway that emerged from the genes upregulated in both groups with upregulation of genes involved in epigenetic regulation of pluripotency  and te lineage   <cit> . pluripotency and cell survival pathways were the most stringent pathways that emerged from the genes upregulated in both groups. the central molecules in this pathway were nanog and casp <dig> which act as gate keepers of pluripotency and apoptosis. among the genes upregulated in ctr-nt vs. ivf, the amyloid precursor protein-associated  pathway emerged with direct relation to tet <dig>  e2f <dig>  arid3a and frd <dig>  several grn nodes emerged from genes upregulated in the tsa-nt group and this culminated in the upregulation of a number of developmentally important genes including snrpn, prkab <dig>  arrb <dig>  gadd45g, and gemin <dig>  in the same way, several grn nodes including kdm5b, stat <dig>  notch <dig>  foxc <dig>  and hspb <dig> were observed within genes upregulated in ctr-nt. finally, vim and ywhag, kit, hdac <dig> were central molecules of the pathways that emerged from genes downregulated in tsa-nt blastocysts.fig.  <dig> gene regulatory networks in ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts. gene regulatory networks representing genes predominantly or commonly up/down -regulated in ctr-nt and tsa-nt -derived blastocysts



identification of tsa effects on fibroblast gene expression
to identify the effects of tsa on fibroblast gene expression, microarray data were queried to select a subset of non-deg transcripts that were oppositely expressed between ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts. the selected subset of genes included cxxc <dig>  lama <dig>  steap <dig>  ubd, sap30l, mt1a, rab9a, hist2h2b, sfn, arpc1b, sor <dig>  arhgef <dig>  lix1l, ppp1r5b, and oxct <dig>  using qrt-pcr, the transcripts that were differentially expressed between treated and untreated fibroblasts were classified as altered transcripts as described by whitworth et al.  <cit> . the fibroblast altered transcripts that had higher normalized expression towards ivf in ctr-nt rather than tsa-nt blastocysts were classified as corrected transcripts . the fibroblast altered transcripts that had higher normalized expression towards ivf in tsa-nt rather than ctr-nt blastocysts were classified as flawed  transcripts . in this respect, we observed that all transcripts, except for ubd, were altered after tsa treatment of fibroblasts . of these, alterations in lama <dig>  cxxc <dig>  and arpc1b resulted in subsequent correction of their expression in tsa-nt blastocysts when compared to ivf. however, alterations in arhgef <dig>  sap30l, mt1a, rab9a and oxct <dig> resulted in subsequent over-compensation of these genes compared to ivf. on the other hand, alterations in steap <dig>  hist2h2b, sfn, sor <dig>  lix1l, and ppp1r5b resulted in their subsequent under-compensation in tsa-nt blastocysts .fig.  <dig> identification of tsa effects on fibroblast gene expression. protocol used for identifying effects of tsa on the expression profile of a subset of genes that were oppositely expressed between ctr-nt and tsa-nt blastocysts. the altered transcripts in the fibroblasts that had higher normalized expressions toward ivf in ctr-nt rather than tsa-nt blastocysts were classified as corrected transcripts. the influenced transcripts in the fibroblasts that had higher normalized expressions toward ivf in tsa-nt rather than ctr-nt blastocysts were classified as flawed  transcripts

fig.  <dig> tsa differently affects fibroblast gene expression. almost transcripts , except for the ubd transcript , were altered after tsa treatment of fibroblasts. alterations in lama <dig>  cxxc <dig>  and arpc1b resulted in subsequent correction of their expression in tsa-nt blastocyst when compared to ivf. however, alterations in arhgef <dig>  sap30l, mt1a, rab9a and oxct <dig> resulted in subsequent over-compensation of these genes compared to ivf. on the other hand, alterations in steap <dig>  hist2h2b, sfn, sor <dig>  lix1l, and ppp1r5b resulted in their subsequent under-compensation in tsa-nt blastocysts



microarray validation with qrt-pcr
to validate the microarray results, fourteen genes were selected to include genes that were significantly upregulated , downregulated ) and non-significantly  deregulated according to the microarray results. the overall profiles of gene expression obtained by qrt-pcr revealed positive validation of microarray results as the majority  of the selected genes had expression profiles consistent with those observed with microarray analysis . the only exception was for the expression of smad <dig>  while similar expression levels of smad <dig> were observed with microarray for both nt groups, qrt-pcr showed significant downregulation of smad <dig> in ctr-nt blastocysts. overall, these validations allow confident interpretation of the results obtained by array hybridization and statistical/functional analysis.

discussion
a key characteristic of oocyte-mediated reprogramming to pluripotency is that the process is very inefficient with only a few viable embryos obtained at the end  <cit> . etiologically, most studies point towards an aberrant gene expression following errors in the erasure and/or rebuilding of epigenetic marks that can affect totipotency and proper differentiation and development of embryos . therefore, several studies have attempted to modify the epigenetic status of donor cells using variants of hdac inhibitors either before or soon after scnt. this study represents a collection of physiological, histological and genomic data of unprecedented completeness to understand the complex phenotype of scnt bovine embryos.

in our study, treatment with tsa was quite beneficial for the in vitro development of scnt embryos compared to control nuclear transfer  and also ivf embryos. the effect of tsa treatment on in vitro development of scnt embryos is controversial in different species . the initial genetic background of donor cells may be involved in the generation of different in vitro results. for example, while tsa increased cumulus cell-derived cloned mouse blastocysts by 5-fold, it had no effect on the developmental competence of esc-derived embryos  <cit> . similarly, tsa treatment increased blastocyst development of scnt bovine embryos produced from fetal fibroblasts but not bone marrow cells  <cit> . notably, tsa treatment altered the allocation of cells in blastocysts as proportionally more cells were allocated to the icm of treated embryos, suggesting that an overriding epigenetic modification of the genome before nt has a carryover effect on cell proliferation and differentiation in preimplantation embryos. ikeda et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a significant increase in icm number in bovine embryos treated with tsa during ivf. these data convinced us that tsa treatment may provide better prognosis for in vivo development by preparing better quality embryos.

however, post-implantation developmental competence was equally compromised in both groups irrespective of tsa treatment. the majority of nt pregnancies were lost by the middle of gestation and only a few fetuses survived in either group. these results are substantially supported by the fact that even though hundreds of scnt embryos were transferred since 1996s, the overall success rate in terms of live birth rate has not changed and remains quite low   <cit> . published in vivo studies on hdacis are both limited and controversial: while tsa was quite beneficial in mice  <cit> , it could not improve full-term development in rabbit  <cit> , pig  <cit> , and cow . the different cell lines used as well as species/strain-specific differences may be involved in the generation of different in vivo results. for example, kishigami et al.  <cit>  observed a significant beneficial effect of tsa on the full-term development of b6d2f <dig>  but not of inbred  mouse clones. moreover, while reconstituted pig embryos derived from fetal fibroblasts could support full term development irrespective of tsa treatment, bone marrow cells of adult sows could do so only after tsa treatment  <cit> . this lends support for the different effects of tsa on in vitro and in vivo development depending on the nuclear donor cell type. due to this important difference between in vitro and in vivo results of scnt with tsa treatment, it became relevant to investigate the fundamental molecular pathways involved in pre-implantation scnt embryo development.

the overall results of transcriptomic analysis indicated that substantial transcriptome reprogramming occurred at the blastocyst stage which is in agreement with all the previous studies in bovine . notably, tsa treatment could not dramatically change the profile of differentially regulated genes compared to ctr-nt. this lack of effect of tsa could be considered in the light of three facts: i) the epigenetic reprogramming mediated by oocyte reprogramming factors is much more efficient than tsa  <cit> , ii) following epigenetic alteration by tsa, somatic cell nuclei are still refractory to the epigenetic reprogramming  <cit> , and iii) scnt-specific transcriptional errors are of a non-random nature and are responsive to neither oocyte- nor tsa-mediated reprogramming  <cit> .

whether specific loci in the genome are preferentially affected during scnt  or the scnt errors have a stochastic nature is still an elusive controversial question  <cit> . consistent deregulation of a defined list of genes would support the hotspot scenario whereas a stochastic model of reprogramming would be suggested when an unpredictable list of genes would emerge from different scnt runs  <cit> . our microarray data revealed consistent and predictable profiles of gene expression between the two scnt groups irrespective of tsa treatment. accordingly, almost all downregulated genes and a great portion of upregulated genes in either nt group were similarly expressed in the other nt group. moreover, as much as 15 % of the genes consistently downregulated in both nt groups were located in chromosome x. this predictability of individual gene expression on a global background of multiple gene expression changes argues for a predominantly non-random, rather than stochastic, nature of reprogramming errors in bovine scnt embryos which is in agreement with the study of inoue et al.  <cit>  on mouse scnt. similarly, maruotti et al.  <cit>  observed a clear bias in the distribution of differentially expressed genes between ivf and nt-derived epiblast stem cells in mice with 30 % of degs being localized on chromosome  <dig>  however, somers et al.  <cit>  observed different embryo to embryo expression profiles in bovine scnt. although we have used several pools of embryos for each contrast, a defined pattern of differences indicates, at least for our fibroblast line, non-random reprogramming errors. while this manuscript was being prepared for publication, a study appeared by matoba et al.  <cit>  that identified genomic domains resistant to zga in mouse scnt by using comparative transcriptome analysis. because these so-called reprogramming resistant regions  were enriched for h3k9me <dig> in somatic nuclei, and since mrna injection of kdm4d markedly improved scnt blastocyst rate from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, they introduced h3k9me <dig> as the critical epigenetic barrier in scnt-mediated reprogramming in mouse. importantly, combined treatment with kdm4d mrna and tsa improved cloning efficiency compared to alone treatment with tsa, but not kdm4d. they suggested that tsa and kdm4d have no synergic effect because their effects are modulated through a similar pathway. this study of matoba et al.  <cit>  in mouse may support our hypothesis on non-random nature of oocyte-mediated reprogramming errors in bovine. therefore, a clear understanding of rrrs in different differentiated/differentiating cells and whether rrrs are of a common or specific-specific nature in mammals will provide a promising approach for improving the efficiency of scnt and induced pluripotent stem cell  technologies.

the great number of x-linked genes consistently deregulated in either group may highlight the importance of reprogramming difficulties on this chromosome. among the deregulated genes, igf2r was upregulated and nap1l <dig> and xist were downregulated in both nt groups compared to ivf. although both x chromosomes are active in the female zygote, one x chromosome endures a dosage compensation mechanism of transcriptional silencing that proceeds through a complex sequence of events between hatching and implantation in bovine embryos  <cit> . reconstituted scnt embryos, however, receive one active and one inactive x chromosome from the donor cell and hence compromising the natural pattern of imprinting reprogramming  <cit> . interestingly, while eggan et al.  <cit>  reported a normal pattern of x chromosome inactivation , xue et al.  <cit>  reported aberrant expression of nine of ten x-linked genes and hypomethylation of xist in organs of deceased cloned calves. similarly, sirna-mediated knockdown of xist resulted in a drastic  increase in the birth rate of male clones  <cit> . in a subsequent study the same group showed that although xist sirna injection largely suppressed over-expression of xist in female scnt embryos, it could not improve survival  <cit> . it is worth noting that after tsa treatment of female bovine embryos, olivera et al.  <cit>  observed an 8-fold decrease in the percentage of blastocysts expressing detectable xist, whereas the expression of g6pd remained unaltered, suggesting specific susceptibility of xist to in vitro culture conditions.

the establishment of escs analogous to those derived from human and mice embryos has remained an elusive goal in ungulates  <cit> . a clear knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of pluripotency genes is fundamental to the understanding of the species-specific characteristics involved and might reveal clues to achieve stable escs in ungulates. analysis of the mouse embryo has revealed that several of the genes that are implicated in the divergence of the icm are identifiable within the context of five canonical pathways, namely tgf-β/activin-nodal, fgfr, wnt, bmp and notch . these gene regulatory networks provide the molecular foundation for the stabilization or destruction of the core pluripotency triad . examination of genes involved in different canonical pathways revealed that a typical bovine scnt blastocyst may possess functional wnt and to some extent fgf signaling pathways, but tgf-β and bmp pathways are not functional. notably, while tsa had no apparent effect on wnt and fgf signal transduction pathways, it altered the expression of smads. conversely, denicol et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the expression of sixteen wnt genes and other genes involved in wnt signaling in day  <dig> morulae, indicating a functional wnt signaling system. by applying wnt agonists and antagonists, they provided evidence suggesting that the wnt signaling pathway is conversely associated with preimplantation embryonic development in bovine. despite similarities in the wnt and fgf pathways, ctr-nt and tsa-nt -derived blastocysts differed in the expression patterns of smads. while the contributions of smads to pluripotency and the downstream events that they may regulate are poorly understood, the observed bias in the expression profile of smads may be associated with the differences observed in the level of downregulation of nanog in tsa-nt- and ctr-nt-derived blastocysts . the homeobox nanog is among the highly conserved transcription factors implicated in esc identity, self-renewal and maintenance, in cooperation with oct <dig> and sox <dig>  therefore, the observed reduction in the expression of nanog should have important implications in the development of cloned embryos. in contrast, iager et al.  <cit>  reported increased expression of nanog in scnt bovine embryos treated with tsa. the transcription factor c-myc is central to a module of highly connected binding sites that are related to different epigenetic modifications of the core pluripotency-associated network  <cit> . c-myc is expressed in esc and cancer cells and it was also upregulated in both scnt groups in this study. however, c-myc functions seem to be distinct from the pluripotency triad’s functions and it may be more involved in the regulation of protein metabolism  <cit> . double inhibition of mapk <dig> and gsk <dig> in bovine blastocysts increased nanog and sox <dig>  but not c-myc  <cit> . taken together, the simultaneous expression of both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways may put the pluripotency of scnt blastocysts in a precarious contradictory state compared to ivf counterparts.

abnormal placental development has been deemed responsible for the majority of scnt problems . it is believed that dysfunctional placentation in clones is the result of aberrant expression of several key transcription factors that are involved in proliferation , differentiation  and function  of trophoblasts  <cit> . importantly, expression of some of these transcripts is increasingly enhanced as the bovine trophoblast elongates  <cit> . in our results, tkdp <dig>  loc <dig> and tbpg were downregulated over 3-fold in scnt blastocysts of both groups, ifn-tau was downregulated in both groups, and hand <dig> was downregulated in the tsa-nt group. tkdp <dig> is responsible for trophoblastic kunitz domain proteins which are is assumed to protect the developing conceptus against potentially damaging proteinases released by maternal cells  <cit> . therefore, one may argue that downregulation of these genes may be involved in the early pregnancy losses.

it has been demonstrated that assisted epigenetic modification improves reprogramming efficiency through improvement of nuclear organization and induction of synchrony between the blastomeres for the expression of nascent mrna  <cit> . we therefore attempted to follow the dynamics of nuclear remodeling and nascent mrna expression in association with the epigenetic alterations of the reconstituted oocytes and blastocysts. the most notable finding was that tsa treatment resulted in a very sharp drop in the level of 5mc  immediately after nuclear transfer coinciding with a parallel increase in the level of 5hmc . interestingly, the 5mc signal at  <dig> hpr was comparable to the level observed in early reconstituted oocytes. however, the 5hmc signal remained significantly higher in tsa-nt vs. ctr-nt embryos. similarly, antony et al.  <cit>  showed that although induction of jmjd2b in mice esc substantially decreased total levels of h3k9me <dig> by 63 %, the level of h3k9me <dig> was returned to normal within minutes following fusion with an enucleated oocyte. notably, this transient change in h3k9me <dig> resulted in a remarkable increase in in vitro, but not in vivo, development which is in agreement with our results. the second finding was that the global levels of dna-methylation and h3k <dig> acetylation in tsa-nt blastocysts were modified to levels similar to ivf blastocysts and this is in agreement with all the other studies . it remains enigmatic how tsa could affect blastocyst formation but not post-implantation health.

these dramatic changes in initial  and final  levels of these crucial epigenetic markers did not recapitulate the changes in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic genes expression. notably, the time-window of nascent oct <dig> and nascent mrna expression was not altered by tsa treatment. in agreement, using gfp-expressing fibroblasts fused to oocytes reconstructed either before  or after  activation, bordignon et al.  <cit>  could not detect gfp signals until the 8- to 16-cell stage regardless of the cytoplast used, suggesting equivalent functional remodeling of chromatin activity in embryos reconstructed with both types of cytoplasts. in contrast, bui et al.  <cit>  and vanthuan et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a more effective formation of dna replication complexes in tsa- and scriptaid-treated mouse embryos which was evidenced by enhanced levels of newly synthesized rna and significant reduction in asymmetric expression of nascent rna. based on our previous study on tsa treatment of early reconstituted embryos  <cit> , this controversy may not be related to tsa treatment of nuclei donor cells or early reconstituted oocytes but instead may be related to species-specific differences in the timing of zygotic genome activation  . these differences provide an unwanted variability in the timing of assisted epigenetic modification in relation to the timing of maximum epigenetic alteration and zga.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comprehensive study on the effects of assisted epigenetic modifications on the transcriptome of bovine scnt blastocysts studied with a microarray chip which covers the bovine preattachment transcriptome and hence allows the exploration of gene expression in bovine blastocysts obtained in different conditions. the results obtained demonstrated substantial reprogramming of the donor cell nuclei by the blastocyst stage with no overt effect of tsa on the number and identity of differentially regulated genes. considering the limited number of genes deregulated in scnt embryos, one may suggest that a simple defect in the expression of a few genes may translate into defective expression of a great number of genes in a ripple effect. this may also suggest a non-random nature of scnt-specific errors that are not tsa-responsive. this also suggests that the miracle of cloning lies in the great capacity of the ooplasm to reprogram almost any type of differentiated cells; but the problems of cloning are due to unstable genes that escape/resist reprogramming and are not responsive to tsa. therefore, future studies should focus on these potentially important deregulated genes involved in extra-embryonic tissue modelling to find strategies to correct their expression before the embryos are transferred to recipients.
