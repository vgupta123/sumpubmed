BACKGROUND
seasonal and pandemic influenza a virus  continues to be a public health threat and to exert a large economic burden worldwide  <cit> . iav rna segments that encode the hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase  proteins can undergo mutation  or reassortment , resulting in new viral strains that humans may lack the heterologous immunity against . in such circumstances, the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are primary, and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of immune responses to iav infection thus becomes necessary to the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies. particularly, the regulations of cell gene expression are of significant importance due to their critical roles in shaping the magnitude and timing of immune responses via the promotion or suppression of the production of various proteins and rnas . since different cell populations with distinct phenotypes and functions are expected to have different gene regulation profiles, it is desirable to characterize the gene regulations for each cell population as in  <cit> . in this study, the respiratory epithelial cells are of primary interest because they are the first barrier and the main target of iav infection in human  <cit> . a number of previous studies have measured and analyzed the gene expression profiles in respiratory epithelial cells during iav infection ; however, only a few studies investigated the gene expression regulators like transcription factors  <cit>  or mirnas  <cit> . several studies in other biological disciplines show that tfs and mirnas cooperatively interact with each other and both of them should be considered in the regulatory network model  <cit> . to our best knowledge, simultaneous identification of both the transcriptional  and post-transcriptional  regulations on a genome-wide scale in human respiratory epithelial cells post iav infection has not been sufficiently addressed.

a number of systems biology approaches have been developed to understand the transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulations , including several studies particularly for influenza h1n <dig> virus infection  <cit> . for example, butte and kohane  <cit>  considered the pair-wise mutual information to screen the gene data associations. friedman et al.  <cit>  employed the bayesian network model to capture the conditional independencies between genes. yeung et al.  <cit>  used the singular value decomposition  and the robust regression for network reverse engineering, given the sparsity of real large-scale networks. zhang and horvath  <cit>  proposed the weighted gene co-expression network analysis, which assigns a continuous connection weight between  <dig> and  <dig> to each gene pair. basso et al.  <cit>  combined the mutual information with the data processing inequality theory to analyze the gene expression profiles in human b cells. ordinary differential equation models have also been considered in the previous studies  <cit> , in which the computing efficiency issues were addressed for high-dimensional dynamic systems. however, as evaluated in  <cit> , the accuracy of these existing methods are not satisfying, and the reliability of network reverse engineering from gene expression data needs to be further improved. more importantly, two key issues are not sufficiently addressed in the previous studies: first, while both tfs and mirnas are the major regulators in controlling gene expression  <cit> , none of the methods mentioned above simultaneously considered both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations such that the inferred interactions could be biased; second, most of the existing approaches are purely data-driven and thus the results could have a high false positive rate .

in this study, we propose a new framework called sitpr, which stands for systematic identification of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations, to identify the regulatory relationships by exploiting both curated knowledge and time-course expression data of mrnas and mirnas. for this purpose, a background regulatory network is constructed on a genome-wide scale by collecting the experimentally-observed interactions in literature or public databases  <cit>  as well as the potential regulatory interactions predicted by representative algorithms for quantifying the sequence-selective binding feasibility between tfs/mirnas and genes  <cit> . since this background network is not cell type or disease specific, only part of the interactions in this background will be activated in respiratory epithelial cells in response to influenza infection. to identify these activated regulatory interactions, we first employ several dimension reduction approaches, including the community detection algorithm based on network modularity  <cit> , the time delay detection method  <cit> , the functional principal component analysis  for screening differentially expressed genes  <cit> , and the maximum information coefficient   <cit> . after dividing the large network into much smaller modules, we propose the constrained lasso method and combine it with the dynamical bayesian network  model to detect the activated regulatory relationships from time-course expression data within each module. our simulation studies suggest that the proposed framework can achieve satisfying performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity for networks of different sizes. we then apply the framework to the real experiment data and analyze the topological and functional features of the regulatory network in respiratory epithelial cells in response to h1n <dig> influenza virus infection.

RESULTS
background regulatory network obtained for human
instead of inferring regulatory network only from expression profiling data, we first build a background regulatory network for human , and then identify the activated regulatory relationships during iav infection using the mrna and mirna time-course expression datasets. we collect the documented regulatory relationships among tfs, mirnas, and genes in various databases and literature, and also incorporate the potential regulatory relationships between regulators and targets predicted according to the sequence motifs of tfbss . for instance, we retrieve information from the encode project  <cit>   so the majority of the regulators and targets in encode  are included in our study. the resulted background regulatory network for human contains  <dig>  nodes and  <dig>  edges, consisting of  <dig>  tfs,  <dig>  mirnas and  <dig>  target genes. among all these edges,  <dig> % are experimentally validated interactions, and the rest are predicted regulatory relationships. note that the regulatory interactions in the constructed background network are not limited to particular cell types or disease conditions; therefore, only part of these interactions will be activated under specific conditions .

for verification purpose, we calculate several statistical measures of the background regulatory network , which clearly suggest that the obtained background network is different from a random network. more specifically, the clustering coefficient of our background network is  <dig> , which is much higher than that of a random network of a comparable size   <cit> . also, the node degrees of our background network are found to satisfy the power-law distribution . fitting the power law y = α ⋅ x- γ, where y denotes the number of nodes and x denotes the node degree, we obtain γ =  <dig> , which is between  <dig> and  <dig> and thus suggests our background network is scale-free. this value also indicates that our background network is not random  <cit> .

the constructed background network is a high-dimensional network. to make the computing cost affordable, we employ several topology-based and data-based dimension reduction methods to divide the background network into smaller modules. we then identify the activated interactions within each module by fitting the dynamic bayesian network model to the time-course expression data. to control the false positive rate, we also introduce the novel constrained lasso formulation into the model fitting procedure.

algorithm performance evaluation and comparison
before we apply the sitpr framework to real data, the algorithm performance should be evaluated and compared using networks of different sizes. more specifically, the network size in terms of total node number is  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  which is chosen to be comparable to the node numbers of the real network modules obtained in this study . we use linear ordinary differential equations  to match the structure of a given network and generate the simulated time-course expression data. to be consistent with the real data used in this study, simulated data are generated at six time points  with six replicates at each time point. gaussian white noises with a standard deviation of 10% of the data mean are added to all the data points. six commonly-used criteria are chosen to evaluate the algorithm performance, including sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , f-measure, matthews correlation coefficient , and the area under roc curve ,
  <dig>  

where tp, fn, fp, and tn are the numbers of true positive, false negative, false positive, and true negative, respectively; also, auc does not have a closed-form expression and is thus not given in eq. .

for illustration purpose, we show a toy example of the regulatory system that consists of only  <dig> genes, which has a background regulatory network structure  as in figure  <dig> and a set of activated regulatory relationships  as in figure  <dig>  furthermore, the mirna is the g <dig> node labeled in magenta, and the true regulation coefficients are explicitly labeled next to each edge in figure  <dig>  the inferred regulatory relationships and coefficients from a randomly-chosen simulated dataset are shown in figure  <dig>  and the corresponding evaluation criterion values together with the roc curve are plotted in figure  <dig>  based on  <dig> simulation runs, we calculate the six criteria and the associated standard deviations. for this toy case, the proposed framework achieves a sn of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , sp of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , f-measure of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , mcc of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , acc of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and auc of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

performance evaluation and comparison of sitpr, pcc, mi, clr, aracne, genie <dig> and tigress for networks of three different sizes


for fairness of comparison when evaluating the performances, all the methods are assigned the same task .

it is necessary to further evaluate the sitpr performance for background regulatory networks of a higher dimension. since the number of nodes in the largest modules obtained by dividing the real background network  is on the order of  <dig>  we consider networks with  <dig> and  <dig> nodes. for this purpose, we adopt two network structures from the dream <dig> challenge  <cit>  so both of them have the small-world property and an exponential degree distribution. the smaller structure has  <dig> nodes and  <dig> activated regulatory relationships, and the larger structure has  <dig> nodes and  <dig> activated regulatory relationships . we randomly add more inactive edges to the two networks  so the smaller background network has  <dig> out of  <dig> edges are activated and the larger network has  <dig> out of  <dig> edges are activated. based on such network structures, we use the linear ode model again to generate simulated data at six time points with six replicates at each time point, and add 10% gaussian white noise to each data point.

it is also necessary to compare the proposed framework with other representative or state-of-the-art reverse engineering approaches. for this purpose, we consider the pearson’s correlation coefficient  method, the mutual information  method  <cit> , and the best four algorithms in the dream challenge, including clr  <cit> , aracne  <cit> , genie <dig>  <cit>  and tigress  <cit> . for fairness of comparison, the same task is assigned to all the methods under comparison: identify the activated regulatory relationships from a given background network. the parameter settings of the other methods under comparison are from the corresponding literature, and we make necessary modifications for these methods to take a background network as input.

in table  <dig>  we summarize the performance comparison results for three different network sizes  based on  <dig> simulation runs. for the 10-node networks, the sitpr approach has a remarkable performance in comparison with the other six methods. for example, the auc of sitpr is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , while the pcc, mi, clr, aracne, genie <dig> and tigress methods only achieve an auc of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. for the 50-node network, the performance of the sitpr framework is again notably superior to those of the other methods, evidenced by the fact that all the six evaluation criteria of sitpr are the largest among all the approaches under comparison. for instance, the auc of sitpr is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , while the mi and pcc methods have the second and the third best aucs of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. as the number of network nodes increase to  <dig>  the performances of all these approaches decrease; however, the sitpr method still outperforms all the other methods in terms of, e.g., aucs.

to assess the robustness of the sitpr method against data noise, we generate  <dig> simulated datasets for each of the three noise levels: let the standard deviation of the gaussian white noise be 10%, 20% or 30% of the data mean. as suggested in table  <dig>  the performance of the sitpr method only marginally deceases as the noise level increases, so we conclude that its performance is robust against data noise. for example, for the three different noise levels, the aucs of our method are  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively.table  <dig> 
effects of the noise level and the total number of background edges on the performance of sitpr based on  <dig> simulation runs




we further evaluate the effects of the total number of edges in the background network on the sitpr performance. in figure  <dig>  we consider a background regulatory network with  <dig> activated interactions out of a total of  <dig> background regulatory relationships. here we increase the number of background regulatory relationships to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while the number of activated interactions remains at  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  when the number of background regulatory relationships increases, the performance of our approach deceases marginally. specifically, the aucs of the sitpr method are  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> background regulatory relationships, respectively.

in summary, the simulation study results provide direct evidences for the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for systematically identifying activated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations from a given background network.

regulations in respiratory epithelial cells during iav infection
we apply the sitpr framework to understand both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations that are activated in human respiratory epithelial cells  in response to h1n <dig> influenza virus infection. in short, from the constructed background regulatory network at the genome-wide scale, we obtain  <dig> functional modules  after dimension reduction, and then identify the activated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations simultaneously in each module using the dynamic bayesian network model together with the constrained lasso formulation .

network motifs are known as the functional building blocks that control gene expressions  <cit> . therefore, after we determine the activated regulatory interactions from the background network, we further identify  <dig> types of 'tf-mirna-gene’ co-regulation motifs using the fandom algorithm  <cit> . for convenience, the results are summarized in table  <dig>  in which the numbers of the  <dig> types of motifs in the background network and in the activated network are both listed. the detailed motif structures can be found in additional file 1: figure ts <dig>  the statistical significance of each motif is also evaluated by calculating the associated z-score. for this purpose,  <dig> random networks are generated, and the z-score is calculated as the difference between the motif occurrence in the real network and its average occurrence in the random networks, divided by the standard deviation of the occurrences in the random networks. we perform such calculations for both the background regulatory network and the activated regulatory network; and a motif with a z-score greater than  <dig> is referred as enriched and statistically significant. for respiratory epithelial cells in response to h1n <dig> influenza virus infection, the ten type of motifs in the background regulatory network after data-based dimension reduction  involve  <dig>  regulatory relationships among  <dig> tfs,  <dig> mirnas and  <dig>  target genes, while nine types of these motifs can be found in the activated network, which involve  <dig>  regulatory relationships among  <dig> tfs,  <dig> mirnas and  <dig>  target genes . in these motifs, the numbers of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations are of the same order of magnitude , which suggests that the importance of the post-transcriptional regulatory interactions may be comparable to that of the transcriptional regulatory relationships.table  <dig> 
ten co-regulation motifs and their occurrence frequencies in the background network and the activated network


motifs are ordered according to their absolute z-scores in the background regulatory network, which are calculated using fanmod  <cit> . motifs 'm1’, 'm2’, and 'm3’ are statistically significant in both the background and the activated regulatory networks . 'm5’, 'm8’ and 'm10’ are not statistically significant in the background regulatory network, while they become significant in the activated regulatory network.



the motifs in the activated regulatory network  are worth of further investigation to better understand the synergy of these motifs in gene expression regulation. we thus combine these co-regulation motifs into larger components if they are connected or overlap with each other. these components involved  <dig> tfs,  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> genes . limited by space, we plot the expression profiles of a part of these tfs, mirnas, and target genes in figures  <dig>  , and , respectively; the structures of a part of the components are sketched in figure  <dig>  a specific example is the component centered at 'cebpb’ , which is an important tf involved in immune and inflammatory responses  <cit> . in this component ), 'trim28’  and 'cebpb’ are found to regulate the expressions of each other, and their expression patterns shown in figure  <dig> are consistent with this prediction. 'hsa-mir-191’ is identified as the primary mirna that targets on the 'cebpb’ mrnas, through which the expressions of a number of important genes are indirectly co-regulated. more specifically, the 'ccl5’  gene, which encodes the rantes chemokine that plays an active role in leukocyte recruiting and nk cell activation and proliferation   <cit> , is found to be the co-regulation target. the 'isg20’ gene  is involved in the antiviral function of interferon against rna viruses  <cit> , and 'abcg1’  is involved in macrophage cholesterol and phospholipids transport, and is crucial for iav replications and clearance responses of immune cells  <cit> . both 'isg20’ and 'abcg1’ are also the target genes co-regulated by 'hsa-mir-191’ and 'cebpb’. such results provide further evidence for the importance of co-regulations in immune responses to influenza virus infection.figure  <dig>

to gain a better view of the broad picture, we perform the functional enrichment analysis on each of the  <dig> modules using david  <cit> . in table  <dig>  the enriched go  biological processes  <cit>  and the documented pathways in kegg/reactome  <cit>  in  <dig> selected modules are listed for illustration purpose; for the complete analysis results, see additional file  <dig>  according to table  <dig>  the 'cell cycle’, 'cell proliferation’, 'positive regulation of programmed cell death’, and 'apoptosis’ are enriched, which suggests an active role of the cell-cycle related functions in response to iav infection. in addition, a number of pathways  are enriched in respiratory epithelial cells, with which a number of important immunological functions are associated . for example, the interferon α/β receptor gene  as well as the entire 'jak-stat signaling pathway’ in module  <dig> are found enriched, which is consistent with the mechanism of the antiviral state development of lung epithelial cells conferred by type i interferons  <cit> .table  <dig>

figures  <dig> and  illustrate the activated regulatory relationships in two example modules  at a higher level of granularity, corresponding to the two components from the left of the first row sketched in figure  <dig>  for transcriptional regulations in figure  <dig>  'ccl5’ is found to be regulated by 'irf5’  and 'nfκb2’  besides 'cebpb’. the induction of 'ccl5’ by 'irf5’ and the regulatory roles of 'nfκb’ and 'cebpb’ in 'ccl5’ expression have been reported in previous studies  <cit>  , and are successfully identified by our method. in addition, the chemokine 'il-8’ is found to be regulated by two tfs, 'nfκb2’ and 'etv4’   <cit> . however, for such many-to-one regulatory relationships, it is unclear which tf is the major regulator and further experiments are thus needed to clarify this issue. multiple post-transcriptional regulations can also be found in figure  <dig>  for example, 'hsa-mir-191’ is identified to suppress gene 'reps1’  in figure  <dig>  and 'hsa-mir-28-5p’ to suppress gene 'cit’  in figure  <dig>  'reps1’ is involved in cytoskeletal signaling pathway and 'cit’ encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions in cell division and functions to promote efficient cytokinesis  <cit> . the repression of the two genes by mirnas suggests a disorder of host factors caused by iav infection via post-transcriptional regulations. moreover, 'ifngr2’  suppression by 'hsa-mir-644’ and 'ifng’  suppression by 'hsa-mir-26a’ are identified in modules  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this indicates the importance of mirnas in innate immune responses against iav infection by interfering ifn production and signaling  <cit> . as an example of co-regulations, the 'hsa-mir-28-5p’-'brca1’-'tubb’ regulation motif can be seen in figure  <dig>  'tubb’  is a major constituent of microtubules  <cit>  in the reactome 'cell cycle’ pathway  <cit> , and is also a known human host proteins for iav replication  <cit> . 'brca1’ is well known as a key mediator for repairing dna damage by maintaining the genomic integrity  <cit> . a better understanding of the activated regulation among 'hsa-mir-28-5p’, 'brca1’ and 'tubb’ could be important to designing the mirna gene therapeutic trials targeting iav host factors  <cit> .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proposed a novel framework for systematic identification of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations  using curated knowledge, sequence-based predictions and time-course expression data. briefly, a comprehensive background regulatory network, which is not cell type- or disease-specific, was constructed at the genome-wide scale using information from ~ <dig> databases and predictions from representative algorithms. after dividing the background network into smaller modules, we further proposed the constrained lasso method and applied it with the dynamic bayesian network model to each of the modules to determine the activated regulatory relationships based on the time-course expression data of mrnas and mirnas. the simulation studies clearly suggest the superiority of the proposed framework over other representative approaches in the context of identifying activated regulatory relationships from a given background network. the sitpr framework was then applied to real data to identify the activated regulatory relationships among tfs, mirnas and target genes in human respiratory epithelial cells in response to h1n <dig> influenza virus infection.

different from many existing methods for inferring gene regulatory network that are purely data-driven  <cit> , we incorporated curated knowledge and utilized sequence information besides time-course gene expression data. including curated knowledge can improve the accuracy of identifying genuine regulatory relationships  <cit> , and the incorporation of predicted potential regulatory interactions among tfs, mirnas and genes allows to discover novel regulatory relationships between regulators and targets. furthermore, the way we constructed the background network  and the use of the constrained lasso help to control the false positive rate in identifying activated regulatory relationships, as suggested in  <cit> . also, since we considered the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations simultaneously, the identified activated regulatory relationships could be less biased  <cit> . it should be mentioned that, limited by data availability and algorithm prediction accuracy, our background network built in this study is not thorough; however, the sitpr framework is flexible and allows us to update the background network whenever new knowledge is discovered or better prediction algorithms are devised.

using the proposed framework, the transcription regulatory landscape was depicted for human respiratory epithelial cells infected by h1n <dig> influenza a virus. the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations were simultaneously identified and analyzed for airway epithelial cells in response to iav infection. besides pairwise interactions, we paid particular attention to regulation motifs and their synergistic effects on gene expressions. we identified ten regulation motifs using fandom and selectively presented and discussed some important motifs activated during iav infection, which could suggest potential targets for influenza treatment or vaccination. it should be addressed that the regulation motifs we defined in this study are not only the functional building blocks but also the topological elements in a complex regulatory network. identification of such motifs can provide the basis for advanced analyses such as differential network biology  <cit> .

the sitpr is also applicable to a pre-defined gene set. for example, figure  <dig> illustrates the activated regulatory relationships in the kegg iav pathway, in which we included the genes contained in this pathway as well as the neighboring mirnas in our background network. one can tell from figure  <dig> that 'stat2’  directly regulates the expressions of  <dig> different mirnas,  <dig> target genes and two other tfs, suggesting a highly influential role of 'stat2’. in addition, we found that 'stat2’, 'irf9’  and 'hsa-mir-583’ form a co-regulation motif. 'stat2’, 'hsa-mir-519b-3p’ and 'jak1’  also forms another co-regulation motif. 'stat2’, 'jak1’ and 'irf9’ are known to be the key regulators in the 'jak-stat signaling pathway’, which plays a critical role in regulating immune responses  <cit> . the co-regulation motif 'mapk1’-'hsa-mir-543’-'il8’ was identified, which may indicate an important role of mirna 'has-mir-543’ in controlling the production of the chemokine 'il8’. in short, one obvious benefit of analyzing a pre-defined gene set is that the network dimension is significantly reduced such that sitpr can achieve a better accuracy, as suggested by our simulation studies. loveday et al.  <cit> , in which the time-course expression data used in this study were generated, also conducted a regulation study on a pre-defined gene set. however, they selected hundreds of differentially expressed genes and only focused on the post-transcriptional regulations between mirnas and target genes. also, the regulatory relationships identified in loveday et al.  <cit>  were primarily based on the baseline and the data on hour  <dig>  therefore, although there exist a few regulatory relationships identified in both our study and loveday’s , the majority of the regulatory interactions identified in the two studies are different due to all the reasons described above.figure  <dig> 
the activated regulatory network in the kegg iav gene set. the genes in the iav pathway together with their neighbors from the background network were analyzed. the importance of mirnas can be told from the co-regulation motifs, such as 'stat2’-'hsa-mir-583’-'irf9’, 'atf2’-'hsa-mir-374b’-'jak1’, 'ikbkb’-'hsa-mir-218’-'akt1’, and 'mapk1’-'hsa-mir-543’-'il8’.



in summary, the background regulatory network constructed in this study provides a start point for the identification of condition-specific regulatory interactions. together with the selected dimension reduction techniques, the sitpr framework is formed to achieve a better accuracy at an affordable computing cost. also, for human respiratory epithelial cells in response to influenza a virus infection, the results generated using sitpr reveal a number of interesting activated regulatory interactions and provide useful clues for future experimental design and validation.
