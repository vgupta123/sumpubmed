BACKGROUND

salmonellosis is one of the most important food-borne diseases, with an estimated one million human cases and more than  <dig> deaths occurring each year in the united states  <cit> . non-typhoidal salmonella is the main cause of foodborne disease in the united states  <cit> . salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis  is one of the most common serotypes of salmonella bacteria reported worldwide which is the major source of human intestinal infections  <cit> . the animal or animal product including poultry, eggs, milk and milk products could be the carriers of se which threaten the human health . salmonella organisms could penetrate the intestines mucosal epithelium to outcompete the resident microbial flora and cause the pathological reaction  <cit> . egg-related salmonellosis is costing $ <dig> million per year in australia  <cit> .

micrornas  are small , non-coding, single-stranded and conserved rnas. it performs multiple functions through regulating gene expression mainly at the post-transcriptional levels  <cit> . it plays an important role in different biological activities such as the development, cell differentiation and disease  <cit> . mirna could regulate innate immunity caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa infection  <cit> . mir- <dig>  mir-146a/b and mir- <dig> were obviously up-regulated in rat’s mononuclear cells after salmonella infection  <cit> . let- <dig> was down-regulated to induce the release of cytokine il <dig>  and il <dig> to participate in the regulation of immune response to salmonella infection in macrophages  <cit> . mirnas also could buffer and alter the variance of relatively lowly expressed genes in the response to salmonella infection in pig  <cit> . however, the responsive mirnas in laying hen salmonella infection is still unclear.

the objective of the present study is to discover the mirnas in the response to salmonella infection in chicken cecum at the onset of egg laying. next generation sequencing  has been widely used to analyze the mirna expression profile in many studies . in the current study, the solexa sequencing method was used to detect differentially expressed mirnas in the response to se infection in white leghorn at the onset of egg laying. our results will expand the list of mirnas related to the host responses to se infection in chickens.

discussion
mirnas play a vital role in regulating immunity induced by bacteria . regulation of mirna expression responding to bacterial infection is emerging as a crucial part of the host response to infection  <cit> . the onset of egg laying is a complex physiological process when physiological and hormonal stress occurs. previously, we have studied the splenic gene expression in laying hens through microarray  <cit> . in the current study, cecal mirna profiling in the response to se infection in laying hens has been identified through solexa sequencing. in total,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> potential novel mirnas were expressed in six libraries.

mirna distribution varies widely in different chromosome in different species, and chromosomes with higher number of mirnas most likely play regulatory roles in several cellular processes including disease. mirnas associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease are mostly located in chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and x in human  <cit> . there is a significant association between the chromosomal location of mirnas and those of cancer susceptibility loci in mouse  <cit> . there are  <dig> % mirna genes located on chicken chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . the skew distribution of mirnas has been observed following se infection in the current study. majority of mirnas responding to se infection located on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  there was no mirnas observed in chicken chr <dig> which is consistent with the current results from mirbase database .

se infection stimulates the mirnas expression. thirty-seven mirnas were differentially expressed following se infection. read counts in the infected group were higher than those in the non-infected group . in the current study, more up-regulated mirnas were observed at 7 days post infection  . more mirnas are up-regulated at 2 days post infection with s. typhimurium in piglet which is consistent with current mirna profiling  <cit> . the similar response to gram-negative bacterial infection could be regulated by mirnas. mirna regulation in immune response is influenced by genetic background. it has been reported that opposite mirna profiling was found between spf layer and broiler chickens infected with aiv   <cit> . functionally, the mirnas target mrnas and trigger either translation repression or rna degradation in animal  <cit> . it has been reported that the complicated interaction between immune system and metabolism exists during se infection in laying hens  <cit> . maintaining metabolic homeostasis requires a balanced immune response. the perturbation of this equilibrium could result in pathological situations  <cit> . it has been reported that mirnas are fine-tuners of metabolic processes  <cit>  and could generate a bidirectional functional link between metabolism and pathogenesis  <cit> . in the current study, target genes of up-regulated mirnas were associated with stronger immune function than metabolism function. target genes of down-regulated mirnas were associated with stronger metabolism compared with immune function. the target genes regulated by both up- and down-regulated mirnas were also associated with stronger immune function than metabolism . the target genes of up- and down regulated mirnas may buffer the homeostasis between immune response and metabolism. those mirnas may contribute to buffer the gene expression of target genes  <cit> . the immune function was repressed at the onset of egg laying  <cit> . the results herein suggested that mirnas could regulate the interaction between immune response and metabolism on day  <dig> post se infection in laying hens.

it is noteworthy that the proteasome pathway had the highest fold enrichment in the enriched pathways. the proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions including antigen processing for appropriate immune responses and inflammatory responses . the nonclassical class ib molecule qa-1b is a dominant restricting element to the recognition of cd8+ t cells which is proteasome-dependent during salmonella infection  <cit> . type iii protein secretion systems  effector protein activities of salmonella are temporally regulated by proteasome-dependent protein degradation  <cit> . the lmp <dig> protein, a subunit of the cytosolic proteasome complex, is up-regulated after invasion of hla-b27-transfected hela cells by salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . both salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium are gram-negative bacteria. this could suggest that proteasome is an important defense system to protect against bacterial colonization regulated by mirnas in chicken.

mir-34a-5p was down-regulated and potentially targeted  <dig> immune-related genes in chicken after se infection. mir-34a was associated with the cellular senescence, it was strongly up-regulated and targeted the important proto-oncogene myc during b-raf-induced senescence  <cit> . mir-34a may play an important role in the loss of oxidative defense in rat liver during aging through suppressing the expression of sirt <dig>  mgst <dig>  sp <dig> and nrf <dig>  <cit> . bcl- <dig> and the foxp <dig> transcription factor, which were required for early b cell development  <cit> , are the direct target of mir-34a, so it was hypothesized that mir-34a plays an important role in b cell development . mir-34a causes a partial block in b cell development, whereas its knockdown results in increased b cells development in rat bone marrow  <cit> . ccl <dig>  il8l <dig> and cdc <dig> were contained in the salmonella infection pathway and were all targeted by mir-34a. ccl <dig> gene is significantly up-regulated at different time points  after se endotoxin treatment  <cit> . cdc <dig> could activate the arp2/ <dig> by n-wasp  to mediate actin polymerization in the invasion of se . it has been reported that mir-34a exclusively expressed in aiv infected chicken lung with targeting  <dig> immune-related genes and four aiv genes  <cit> . although there were no se genes regulated by mir-34a predicted, the down-regulation of mir-34a may conduce to b cell development in the response to se infection in chickens.

gga-mir- <dig> is located in the intron of mamdc  <dig>  on chrz. gga-mir- <dig> is up-regulated in both layer and broiler following aiv infection suggests that it responds to aiv infection across diverse genetic lines  <cit> . six immune-related genes were potentially targeted by gga-mir-1416-5p including bcl <dig>  nfkbia and tlr <dig>  which were important in the response to bacterial infection. bcl <dig> mediates the lps-induced activation of nf-κb and il <dig> in normal human intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . chicken tlr <dig> is involved in the recognition of bacterial components and salmonella in the innate immune response  <cit> . the expression of tlr  <dig> was decreased in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ceca and large intestine of broilers following se infection  <cit> . in the current study, the expression of tlr  <dig> was significantly down-regulated and had reversely regulatory direction with the regulating gga-mir-1416-5p post se infection. gga-mir-1416-5p could play an important role in response to se infection through regulating the target genes.

the interaction of mirna with target genes plays an important role in many biological functions. toll-like receptors  recognizes specific patterns of microbial components and participate in the innate immunity and antigen-specific adaptive immunity  <cit> . as one of the main pattern recognition receptors, tlr can identify the pathogen to activate the immune cells response and induce to produce type i interferon and a series of proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . tlr1la could combine with tlr <dig> to form a dimer and efficiently identify bacterial peptidoglycan and lipoprotein  <cit> . tlr1la is significantly up-regulated at the ileum, cecum and colon at 24 h post se infection in day-old chickens  <cit> . gga-mir- <dig> was significantly up-regulated in chicken lung following aiv infection  <cit> . gga-mir- <dig> was down-regulated while its target gene tlr1la was up-regulated in the response to se infection in the current study. the interaction of gga-mir- <dig> with tlr1la could be important in the respond to se infection in chicken. further study is warranted to verify the function of interaction between gga-mir- <dig> and tlr1la.

CONCLUSIONS
mirnas mediate the homeostasis between metabolism and immunity in the response to se infection at the onset of egg laying. the gga-mir-34a-5p, gga-mir-1416-5p and gga-mir- <dig> could play important roles in se infection through regulating their target genes. the finding herein will pave the foundation for the studies of microrna regulation in se infection in laying hens.
