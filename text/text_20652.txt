BACKGROUND
different plant species have various physiological adaptations to deal with long-term or short-term drought stress. in the short-term drought stress response, the phytohormone abscisic acid  regulates guard cell movement to close stomata. however, aba also functions in the long-term stress response by regulating the development of reproductive tissues via massive transcriptional reprogramming events under prolonged drought. this results in growth retardation and decreased crop yields  <cit> . in plants, drought resistance functions through aba-dependent and aba-independent regulatory systems, as revealed in studies on drought-induced genes in arabidopsis thaliana and rice   <cit> . in arabidopsis, calcium-dependent and -independent pathways mediate transcriptional reprogramming via an aba-dependent pathway under water deficit  <cit> .

peanut is one of the most important oil crops worldwide. it is widely cultivated in asia, africa, and the americas  <cit> . however, seasonal droughts often affect peanut yields and quality, causing significant economic losses. little is known about the molecular signaling and regulatory mechanisms of the drought response in peanut because of its complex genetic background, and the lack of systematic research. therefore, we have focused our research on drought resistance of cultivated peanut for many years. in plants, water deficit triggers the expression of numerous stress-induced genes, which encode products that enhance drought tolerance and allow continued growth  <cit> . aba plays a key role in this response, but aba signaling components and target genes often overlap with other signaling systems  <cit> . many drought-responsive transcription factor genes have been identified in various species, such as areb1/abf <dig> and dreb2a in arabidopsis, and abp <dig> in maize   <cit> . in arabidopsis, these drought-responsive transcription factors activate the expression of the downstream target genes rd29a and rd29b. consequently, rd29a and rd29b can serve as marker genes for drought or aba signaling  <cit> . large-scale screening of peanut has identified some stress-related genes. for example, fungus-infected peanut seeds showed increased transcript levels of genes encoding late-embryogenesis-abundant  family proteins, and increased levels of their products  <cit> . likewise, a drought-resistant relative of peanut, arachis duranensis, showed increased transcript levels of basic leucine zipper  transcription factor genes when subjected to drought . a pest-resistant relative of peanut, arachis stenosperma, showed increased transcript levels of myb family transcription factor genes when infected with fungi  <cit> .

in our previous studies, we cloned and characterized some drought-related genes from peanut, including the aba synthesis gene ahnced <dig> <cit> , and three dehydration-induced transcription factor genes, ahareb <dig> <cit> , ahnac <dig> <cit> , and ahnac <dig> <cit> . the expression of these genes rapidly responds to water deficit in peanut. therefore, similar to rd29a and rd29b in arabidopsis, the transcript level of ahnced <dig> can serve as a molecular marker for screening drought-resistant varieties of peanut. furthermore, the promoter region of ahnced <dig> contains many abscisic acid-responsive elements . site-directed mutagenesis of two of these abres diminished ahnced <dig> promoter activity  <cit> , suggesting that aba signaling pathways directly regulate ahnced <dig>  the aba-responsive element binding protein  gene ahareb <dig> was cloned from peanut and overexpressed in arabidopsis <cit> . a microarray analysis showed that the transcription of atnced <dig>  was significantly higher in the ahareb1-overexpressing plants than in wild type  <cit> . recently, we found that ahareb <dig> may directly regulate ahnced <dig> .

the response to water deficit or aba in arabidopsis has been studied using transformation techniques, and the results of such studies have improved our understanding of the arabidopsis drought response. however, similar research on the drought response of peanut has been hampered by the low efficiency of transformation and the complex tetraploid genome of this important crop plant. to address this issue, we used a global transcriptome analysis to study the mechanisms by which peanut copes with drought stress, and to provide a comprehensive sequence resource for further molecular genetic research on this species.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly
we generated  <dig> , <dig>  paired-end reads with an average length of 905 bp for the peanut cultivar yueyou <dig>  of the clean reads,  <dig> % had phred-like quality scores at the q <dig> level and  <dig> % had phred-like quality scores at the q <dig> level, with gc contents of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the high-quality reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes . we obtained  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads from the water deficit without aba-pretreatment group,  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads from the water deficit + aba-pretreatment group, and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads from the control .

peanut_r <dig> represents left-reads, peanut_r <dig> represents right-reads. seq-dup-level  represents the proportion of repeated reads in total reads. aba_ <dig> min represents 30% peg <dig> treated for 30 min after aba pretreatment for 30 min. peg_ <dig> min represents 30% peg <dig> treatment for 30 min. control, no treatment.

genes modulated by water deficit and their predicted functions
to identify genes showing changes in expression in response to water deficit, peanut seedlings were subjected to a 30% peg <dig> treatment. this treatment has been used to simulate water deficit in several other studies  <cit> . the 30-min peg treatment caused leaf wilting of 2-week-old peanut seedlings. after the peg treatment, we collected leaves from the same position on the stalk for rna extraction and sequencing. in total,  <dig> genes were rapidly induced  by water deficit;  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . also,  <dig> of these genes showed very large changes in expression levels ;  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. among the genes induced by water deficit alone,  <dig> encoded transcription factor-like proteins.

next, we grouped the differentially expressed genes  into goseq functional categories  based on wallenius’s non-central hyper-geometric distribution  <cit> . the degs were grouped into three main categories ; molecular function , biological process , and cellular components . in a similar microarray study of the drought-resistant species a. duranensis, most contigs belonged to the molecular function category , with fewer belonging to cellular component  and biological process  categories  <cit> . these findings suggest that the dynamic changes in gene expression differ between short-term and long-term drought responses.

we further analyzed each functional category to identify which proteins were the most enriched. proteins related to oxidation reduction processes  were the most enriched in the biological process category and oxidoreductases  were the most enriched in the molecular function category. ribosome  was the most highly represented in the cellular components category. we used the kegg  database to annotate the pathways and found that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  and linoleic acid metabolism  were the most enriched pathways in peanut seedlings under water deficit .

genes modulated by water deficit + aba pretreatment and their predicted functions
in peanut, aba accumulation and distribution modulate physiological responses during the short-term response to water deficit  <cit> . in our preliminary experiments, exogenous aba treatment caused stomata to close within  <dig> min, and aba treatment for  <dig> min resulted in changes in the expression levels of numerous stress-related genes. in the present study,  <dig>  genes showed altered expression  in response to water deficit + aba pretreatment;  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated . among these genes, those involved in gluconeogenesis  and the plant–pathogen interaction  were the most enriched . among the genes showing altered expression,  <dig> were highly induced , and  <dig> genes encoded putative transcription factors . the degs were classified into three main go categories; molecular function , biological process , and cellular components  . in the molecular function category, genes encoding proteins with oxido-reductase activity , catalytic activity  and protein kinase activity  were the most enriched. proteins related to oxidation-reduction processes , metabolic process , and protein phosphorylation  were enriched in the biological process category. in the cellular components category, the proteinaceous extracellular matrix  and ubiquitin ligase complex  were the most highly enriched categories.

many ubiquitin-related enzymes are thought to regulate the plant drought stress response, but for many of these candidate regulators, including mms <dig> <cit>  and zmrfp <dig> <cit> , their mechanism of action remains unclear. in arabidopsis, atpub <dig> and atpub <dig> negatively regulate the aba-mediated drought response  <cit> . in peanut, overexpression of the ubiquitin-related gene ahubc <dig> was shown to enhance drought tolerance  <cit> . together, these results indicate that protein ubiquitination is linked to aba-mediated drought responses in peanut. compared with the water-deficit group, the water deficit + aba pretreatment group showed dramatic down-regulation of water deficit-induced genes, including those related to translation, metabolic process, ribosome, structural constituents of ribosome, and oxido-reductase activity .

aba-dependent and aba-independent regulation of gene expression during the water deficit response in peanut
to examine the relationship between signaling under water deficit and that under water deficit + aba pretreatment, we identified genes showing similar or different patterns of regulation between these two treatments. first, we identified  <dig> genes with significant overlaps in expression between the water deficit only and water deficit + aba treatment groups. of these,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated by both water deficit alone and water deficit + aba pretreatment, compared with their respective expression levels in the control. only  <dig> genes were more strongly induced by water deficit + aba treatment than by water deficit alone . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were up-regulated,  <dig> were down-regulated, and  <dig> encoded putative transcription factors.

the transcript levels of comp65973_c <dig>  decreased both under water deficit  and under water deficit + aba pretreatment . the transcript levels of comp64977_c <dig>  increased both under water deficit  and under water deficit + aba pretreatment . the fact that water deficit + aba pretreatment did not affect their expression more strongly than did water deficit alone suggests that aba does not regulate the expression of these genes. thus, these transcripts appear to be regulated by water deficit through an aba-independent pathway.

except for comp64977_c <dig>  nine nac or nac-like genes showed rapid responses to water deficit + aba pretreatment, but were not induced by water deficit alone. these genes, and the extent of their induction by water deficit + aba, were as follows: comp60831_c0/ahnac <dig> , comp65819_c0/ahnac <dig> , comp61624_c <dig> , comp65473_c <dig> , comp66232_c <dig> , comp63320_c <dig> , comp65172_c <dig> . these findings indicate that these genes are regulated by water deficit through an aba-dependent pathway. comp65819_c0/ahnac <dig> and comp60831_c0/ahnac <dig> were reported to show significant increases in transcript levels under dehydration, water deficit , or aba treatment  <cit> . we did not identify these loci as differentially expressed under water deficit in this experiment, probably because of the short treatment time  used in our analyses.

among the overlapping genes,  <dig> showed differences in expression between water deficit and water deficit + aba pretreatment;  <dig> were down-regulated under water deficit but up-regulated under aba + water deficit, and  <dig> were up-regulated under water deficit but down-regulated under aba + water deficit. this result indicates that these genes are regulated by water deficit through an aba-dependent pathway, but they could have opposite functions in the water deficit response. for example, comp66875_c <dig> and comp62508_c <dig> were down-regulated by water deficit but up-regulated by aba + water deficit. the protein encoded by comp66875_c <dig> shows sequence similarity to a low-temperature-induced 65 kda protein in glycine max, and that encoded by comp62508_c <dig> shows sequence similarity to the homeobox-leucine zipper protein athb- <dig>  comp62508_c <dig> was down-regulated by water deficit , but up-regulated by water deficit + aba pretreatment . in arabidopsis, athb- <dig> is transcriptionally regulated in an aba-dependent manner and modulates aba signaling by regulating the activities of pp2c and an aba receptor gene  <cit> . consistent with our results in peanut, in arabidopsis, the athb- <dig> response to aba was observed in seedlings within 30 min of drought stress, and its transcript levels continued to increase after 12 h or 72 h of drought stress  <cit> .

the genes encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  and abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase-like proteins , which regulate aba biosynthesis and degradation, respectively, were significantly induced by water deficit + aba pretreatment. in our previous study, we detected high transcript levels of ahnced <dig> in response to aba or drought stress  <cit> . in the present study, all of the genes related to aba metabolism showed increased transcript levels in response to exogenous aba treatment, suggesting positive feedback regulation by aba. however, the transcript levels of areb-like transcription factors did not change in response aba or water deficit, although many showed a constitutive high level of transcription under both conditions and in the control. therefore, nac transcription factors appear to respond quickly to water deficit + aba pretreatment . these transcription factors, together with areb-like transcription factors, may regulate aba biosynthesis enzymes or hydroxylases. however, further experimental evidence is required to confirm this.

in previous studies, oligonucleotide array or cdna microarray analyses have identified  <dig> aba-responsive genes in rice  <cit>  and  <dig> aba-responsive genes in arabidopsis <cit> . more aba-responsive genes were identified in peanut than in other plants. here,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained from the drought-resistant peanut cultivar yueyou <dig>  in another study,  <dig>  high contigs were obtained from 2-month-old plants of a. stenosperma , and  <dig>  high contigs were obtained from 3-month-old plants of a. duranensis   <cit> . in a different study,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained from  <dig> immature seeds of five plants  <cit> . these findings suggest that the distribution of unigenes differs among plant types to some extent.

we did not detect homologs of rd29a and rd29b in the peanut seedling transcriptome. we detected comp66875_c <dig> and comp56618_c <dig>  which encode proteins similar to the low-temperature-induced 65 kda protein . our results suggest that, similar to rd29b, comp66875_c <dig> and comp <dig> are controlled mainly by aba. rd29a and rd29b encode closely related hydrophilic proteins, and are quickly and strongly induced by drought and salt stress  <cit> . they are considered to be drought stress or aba-signaling activity marker genes in arabidopsis. their promoters have been used to drive the expression of genes that confer water-stress tolerance, for example, wheat expansin <cit>  and rice osbzip <dig> <cit> , without affecting plant growth and development. however, no close homologs of rd29a or rd29b have been identified in crop species such as rice, sorghum, maize, and soybean  <cit> . therefore, ahnced <dig> and comp66875_c <dig> represent marker genes for downstream events in the aba-dependent pathway in peanut.

quantitative pcr validation of changes in gene expression
to validate the gene expression changes detected in the transcriptome analysis, we used quantitative pcr to quantify the transcript levels of nine candidate genes. we analyzed the transcript levels in plants under water deficit and in those under water deficit + aba pretreatment at  <dig> min and  <dig> h time points . comp69184_c <dig>  comp65209_c <dig>  and comp29919_c <dig>  which encode putative transcription factors, were induced both by water deficit and water deficit + aba pretreatment in our transcriptome analysis. similar to the results of the transcriptome analysis, the qpcr results showed that all three of these genes were induced by water deficit or aba at  <dig> min and  <dig> h. the quantitative pcr results also showed that comp65209_c <dig> was strongly induced under water deficit at  <dig> h. comp65848_c <dig>  comp66763_c <dig>  comp69670_c <dig>  comp54319_c <dig>  and comp65737_c <dig> were induced by aba at  <dig> min or  <dig> h. these results were generally consistent with the results of our transcriptome analysis.

the transcript level of comp69670_c <dig> increased under water deficit at 5 h, as reported previously. comp69670_c <dig>  encodes a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; ahnced <dig> is a key enzyme in aba biosynthesis in peanut and its expression was shown to increase during drought stress  <cit> . comp54319_c <dig> and comp65737_c <dig>  which belong to the p <dig> family, are homologs of abscisic acid 8-hydroxylase  <dig> and abscisic acid 8-hydroxylase  <dig> from soybean , respectively, suggesting that they encode enzymes involved in aba catabolism. aba is rapidly synthesized and accumulates under water deficit to induce stress resistance in plants. however, stress responses also include a protection mechanism to avoid excessive aba accumulation, and this can retard growth. thus, aba catabolism genes are rapidly induced after aba accumulation. the biosynthesis and catabolism genes play major roles in maintaining a balance of endogenous aba for stress resistance and growth recovery after drought stress.

in our previous study, we found that ahareb <dig> was induced by aba or water deficit  <cit> . we did not detect significant expression of ahareb <dig> under water deficit or aba in our transcriptome data, so we revalidated its expression. we found that ahareb <dig> expression significantly increased after  <dig>  h water deficit with aba pretreatment, but not under water deficit, although it was slightly up-regulated. the different expression patterns detected in our studies may be due to experimental errors in treating plant materials or in transcriptome sequencing. this highlights the importance of validating the results of large-scale transcriptome analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
we used rna-seq to conduct a global characterization of the peanut transcriptome response to water deficit and aba. we generated  <dig>  ×  <dig> raw reads, assembled into  <dig>  unigenes, from the peanut cultivar yueyou <dig>  we identified degs between the early response to water deficit or water deficit + aba pretreatment. these genes were annotated with go functional categories; under water deficit there were  <dig> categories, and under water deficit + aba pretreatment there were  <dig> categories. only  <dig> genes were highly induced by water deficit, but  <dig> genes were highly induced by water deficit + aba pretreatment. now that these genes have been identified, our future research will focus on their functions and relationships. these data will be useful for functional genomic studies on peanut. we have established a biotechnological platform to study the early drought- and aba-induced transcriptome regulatory network in peanut.
