BACKGROUND
a dynamic process of retina differentiation occurs from embryonic day  <dig> to postnatal day  <dig>  six major neuronal and one glia cell type are generated from multipotential progenitors in a characteristic sequence during development  <cit> . revealing the intrinsic program of gene regulation that accompanies mammalian retinal development is a key step for eventual cure of many human retina diseases and blindness.

microarray analysis has been used extensively in studies of tumor biology  <cit>  as well as transcription and genome organization in yeast  <cit> . in the eye there have been a number of microarray studies but few have studied changes in gene expression over development  <cit> . many of the previous studies focused on a specific cell type, for example using isolated target single cell  <cit>  or cell populations  <cit> , or retinas from cell type specific mutants  <cit> . gene expression profiles obtained without artifacts introduced by isolation procedures or gene mutations provide a valuable overview of retina development under natural developmental conditions.

there are several reasons for the slow adoption of microarray technology to studies of development, especially in mammals,  <cit> . first, temporally and spatially restricted tissue or cell patterns cause difficulties in dissecting target tissues or cells to collect enough rna. second, a broader spectrum of experimental points during developmental processes leads to increased costs, especially when using common comprehensive arrays. third, even using currently available comprehensive arrays, tissue-specific genes are still under-represented, including alternatively spliced variants or genes that are only briefly expressed in a tissue-specific pattern. in our recent report  <cit> , about 40% of mouse retina transcripts are not contained within the comprehensive set of riken  <dig>  mouse full-length cdnas  <cit> , indicating that generation of a tissue-specific microarray might be helpful to make complete gene expression profiles for specific tissues or functional units.

in this study we have used whole retinal rna, without amplification, to obtain an overall view of gene expression during retina development that is not restricted to individual genes or retinal cell types. we found that two major groups of gene expression clusters are separated by a gene expression transition stage from pn <dig> to pn <dig>  distinct gene populations were expressed before and after this critical stage. the different genes that belong to the same functional clusters are expressed in the two groups, respectively. we suggest that a change in expression of cell cycle and chromatin modification genes results in a large change in gene expression profile and that this initiates the final maturation of the postmitotic retina.

RESULTS
high performance of mouse retina tissue-specific cdna microarrays
we have constructed a novel retina tissue-specific cdna microarray that contains over  <dig>  clones representing more than  <dig>  unigene clusters   <cit> . tissue was collected at e <dig>  , e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig>  as well as pn <dig> , pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  and pn <dig>  and pools of  <dig> to  <dig> retinas from each time point were used to cover the whole period of retinogenesis. total rna  from each time point was used for each microarray reaction without amplification. a reference sample consisting of equal amounts of rna from all time points was used as a normalization control for each experiment. three microarrays were processed for each time point and data points showing differences from control that were both log <dig> >  <dig> and p <  <dig>  in a one-way anova test were collected for further analysis. the list of average expression values of each gene at all time points is provided as additional file  <dig> 

in the present study, about 70%  of genes showed at least a 2-fold difference in expression during development . genes were designated as changed significantly if the average changes from the three arrays were greater than 2-fold with p <  <dig>  by one-way anova analysis. the ratios reflected the changes of the gene expression compared with its normalized averages. the actual alteration of the gene expression was much bigger between each time point. for example, clone be <dig> annotated as rhodopsin had a ratio  <dig>  at e <dig>  and a ratio  <dig>  at pn <dig>  giving an actual difference of  <dig> fold between the two time points. a total of  <dig>   genes met both criteria, and a full list of changed genes is shown in additional file  <dig>  this proportion is higher than the 20% of genes that were found to be changed in previous studies of mouse development using cerebellum, hippocampus, and lung  <cit> . it is, however, similar to the 70% to 80% of genes that changed significantly during the developmental survey period in drosophila  <cit>  and c. elegans  <cit> .

some of the genes we found to change during development have been previously studied using quantitative rt-pcr  and in situ hybridization. we have previously shown a similar ratio and expression pattern of mouse membrane palmitoylated protein  <dig>  gene by qpcr and microarray analysis  <cit> . the comparison of qpcr and microarray results for rho, rds, glu <dig>  ccnd <dig>  ccpg <dig>  cdk2ap <dig>  ext <dig>  fh <dig>  tmpo, and sat <dig> genes are also shown in additional file  <dig> 

classification of development stage by hierarchical clustering
eisen's program  <cit>  was used to cluster gene expression at distinct retina developmental points. figure 2a shows the tree-chart of correlative gene expression from e <dig>  to pn <dig>  two development phases are evident: a "developmental phase"  and a "functional phase"  based on their correlative distance of gene expression. an obvious gap of gene expression patterns between the two phases is the transition stage pn <dig> in all the observations of this study. this is in agreement with a recent observation  <cit>  that the starting point of outer plexiform layer formation might be the transition between stages of cell commitment and maturation and occurs at about pn <dig> 

six expression clusters were also defined through the period of development studied. in the "developmental phase", there are four clusters: e <dig>  , e <dig>  to e <dig>  , pn <dig> to pn <dig> , and pn <dig> . many genes are expressed in only one or two clusters. for example, high expression of igf <dig>  igf2bp <dig>  and six <dig> were found in cluster-i; grb <dig>  ccnb <dig>  and foxn <dig> are highly expressed in both cluster-i and ii; fgf <dig> and gap <dig> are highly expressed in cluster-ii; ddx <dig>  hmgb <dig>  and kdd <dig> are highly expressed in cluster-iii . a number of genes encoding ribosomal proteins are highly expressed in clusters-i and ii .

in the "functional phase", two clusters, pn <dig> to pn <dig>  and pn <dig> to pn <dig>  were defined. figure 2b shows gene expression profiles ordered by onset of their first increase in transcript abundance. a group of about  <dig> genes in the "functional phase"  contained major retina specific genes like rhodopsin, sag, peripherin <dig>  abca <dig>  rom <dig>  rs1h, rgr, gng <dig>  pde6b, and pde6g  and present a similar pattern of gene expression . the molecular classification of retinal development through hierarchical clustering on the basis of gene expression patterns correlates well with the previous classification of retina development from the studies of morphology and biochemistry.

functional views of retina developmental clusters
to test whether there were differences in gene functions between the "developmental phase" and the "functional phase", the gene ontology  database  <cit>  was used to assign expressed genes to functional groups.  <dig> sub-categories under biological processes were employed to analyze the gene functions in the two phases. the relative proportions of these functional groups in those two phases are shown in the pie charts of figure 3a. the sub-categories, protein metabolism, cell cycle, cell-cell signaling, chromosome organization and stress response, constituted a 2-fold greater proportion in the "developmental phase" than in the "functional phase". ribosome biogenesis showed an even greater difference, constituting 5% of the "developmental phase" but only  <dig> % of the "functional phase". conversely, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, phosphate metabolism, and transport functional groups all represented a significantly increased proportion in the "functional phase" compared with the "developmental phase". there were no changes in cell adhesion, cell death, development, nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction and functional unknown groups in the two phases.

these changes are shown in more detail in figures 3b and 3c using the cellular component category of the go database in addition to the biological processes category. the percentage of genes with higher expression levels  in each functional group was calculated at each age. in the ribosome biogenesis, rna metabolism, and protein biogenesis groups , more than 50% of genes showed elevated expression in the "developmental phase", but less than 10% in the "functional phase". the percentage of genes expressed at higher levels in the first three cluster periods  varied very little. in the sensory function sub-category , the percentage of genes with higher expression profiles increased gradually in the "functional phase" and maintained their higher levels in the clusters of pn <dig> to pn <dig>  in other categories, such as development, signal transduction, transcription, nucleotide metabolism, protein modification, and protein degradation, the percentages of genes expressed were maintained at the same levels during the period surveyed. using the cellular component category we found that more than 50% of genes with increased expression levels were located in the nuclear membrane, nucleus, ribosome, and spliceosome groups in the period of the "developmental phase" .

differential expression of genes in the same functional categories
many of the functional categories seemed to show no differences in expression throughout development. to analyze whether this broad classification might mask differential expression of individual genes, we performed gene clustering after go analysis. seven distinct categories of gene expression profiles are shown in figure  <dig>  we analyzed the genes with nuclear and ribosome localization, subcategories of cellular component. the majority of nuclear distributed genes, such as rax, sox <dig>  tcf <dig>  and six <dig> , were expressed in the developmental phase and most of them reduced their expression level between the developmental and functional phases. in contrast a few of the genes in this group were preferentially expressed in the functional phase. one example of this group is lhx <dig>  a lim homeodomain protein that contributes to specification of pituitary cell lineages and motor neurons  <cit> . the role of lhx <dig> in the retina is unclear.

genes in six subcategories of the biological process category were also analyzed and the results shown in figure  <dig>  carbohydrate metabolism genes are involved in many cellular functions and the majority of the genes from this group are highly expressed in the functional phase starting after the transition stage at pn <dig> . one gene in this group, b3gatl encoding beta- <dig>  3-glucuronyltransferase  <dig>  plays a role in the biosynthesis of hnk1/vc <dig> /cd <dig>  <cit>  which is found on both müller glia and neuronal cells including horizontal and amacrine cells  <cit> . different genes involved in lipid metabolism divide into two opposite expression groups by pn <dig> . about  <dig> genes have a very low level of expression in the developmental phase but significantly increase their expression levels after pn <dig>  this group included rod specific genes rbp <dig>  elovl <dig>  and abca <dig>  the last two of which have been associated with macular degeneration in humans. other genes, like osbp <dig> which is found in both the macula and the peripheral neural retina of monkeys and may mediate oxysterol cytotoxicity in tissues  <cit> , are also in this group.

cell cycle and cell death are the critical events during retina development. the major genes involved in cell cycle processes are highly expressed in the developmental phase and their expression is significantly reduced before the transition stage . such genes include ccnd <dig>  ccnb <dig>  ccna <dig>  pcna, and cdk <dig>  genes from this group are also expressed in the functional phase like ccng <dig> that has been shown to be up-regulated during growth inhibition and b cell antigen receptor-mediated cell cycle arrest  <cit> . expression of cell death related genes showed similar patterns as above . genes such as birc <dig>  also called survivin, which is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis  gene family  <cit>  and has been identified as a neuronal precursor-enriched gene  <cit> , is expressed in the developmental phase and is suddenly lost before the transition stage at pn <dig> 

phosphorylation by protein kinases is a crucial process during signal transduction. protein kinases are classified into many distinct subgroups of tyr  and ser/thr  kinase families and the expression patterns of most genes in these groups are basically similar to those described above in that they are expressed on one or other side of the transition point. only a small number of these genes are expressed in the functional phase, including mapk <dig> also called p <dig>  clk which is a protein kinase regulated pre-mrna splicing enzyme  <cit> , and nlk which is a downstream kinase of the transforming growth factor  signaling pathway and also crosstalks with stat <dig> signals in mesoderm induction  <cit> . interestingly, increased expression of mapk <dig>  also called jnk <dig>  that is required for apoptosis in the developing embryonic neural tube  <cit> , occurs during the perinatal period and is reduced after the transition stage. overall our results show that there are very few genes with high expression during the whole of retinal development and that expression of the majority of the genes becomes either reduced or increased during the transition stage. since there are no other clear transition stages of gene expression found in this study, it suggests that the different sets of gene expression are influenced by common events during the transition stage.

correlation coefficient of gene expression between microarray and sage analysis
the serial analysis of gene expression  method has been used for studying gene expression during mouse retina development  <cit> . here we compared the data from the sage and our microarray studies. among more than  <dig>  microarray good spots, we found  <dig>  sage sequence tags which matched our microarray . in the  <dig>  significantly changed genes,  <dig>  genes did not have matches in the sage database . to have equal and comparative data from the two studies, we have reorganized the data from sage database and transferred the data format to approximate our microarray profiles which are presented as ratio of gene expression at each time point from the total expression levels. we first extracted the sage sequence tag numbers of e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  pn <dig>  and adult from the sage database  <cit>  and normalized them with the total sage sequence tags for each gene as gene expression profiles. a correlation coefficient analysis showed that only a small population  with a high expression level and retina preferential expression shows a high correlation between the sage and microarray studies, whereas about 5% genes  showed a negative correlation . since there is not perfect compatibility between the two systems and experimental designs, the main body of the gene expression profiles have a lower correlation, indicating that complementarily distinct methods will be beneficial for studies of gene expression profiles as a whole. another cause of the lower correlation might be the poor annotation that reduces the matching rates. as shown in figure 5b, only  <dig> % of the genes  which have been annotated in the microarray were not matched with sage data, whereas more than 30% of the genes  which have not been annotated were not matched. a sheet combining microarray data from this study, sage data  <cit> , and in situ hybridization  <cit>  is provided as additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes with in situ hybridization information can be found in our microarray database.

later expression genes are not restricted in rod population
one possible bias of the later gene expression pattern might be due to a dominant cell population, like rod photoreceptors, that are generated during postnatal retina development. to test whether this is a major contributing factor to our data we have compared the rod expressed genes, defined in our previous study by comparing gene expression in wild-type and rd <dig> retinas  <cit> , with the total set of genes expressed in the later phase of this study. as shown in figure  <dig>  about 37% of the genes  of the later phase population were related to rods. about 20% of the genes  in this later phase were expressed with more than a  <dig> fold difference in expression in wild-type retina compared with rd <dig> retina . these results indicate that genes expressed in the later phase are not restricted to rod photoreceptors, and that other retina cell types might also contribute to the population.

many of the later phase expressed genes unrelated to rods may be expressed by bipolar cells and müller glial cells that develop at the same time as rods, as suggested previously  <cit> . for example, glul, glutamate-ammonia ligase in müller glial cells and pcp <dig>  purkinje cell protein  <dig>  in bipolar cells are expressed with the same time course as genes characteristic of rod development. however, genes from the same later expression group are also typical of other cell types of retina which appear earlier in development. for example, ext <dig>  a gene related to heparan sulfate biosynthesis is required for axon sorting in retina ganglion cells  <cit>  and gnat <dig>  a cone transducin alpha-subunit  <cit>  show the same developmental profile as known rod genes. the developmental profile of some genes has not been described before, such as gabral, a gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptor, or has been shown to be related to retinal on-type bipolar cells  <cit> , müller glial cells  <cit> , and cone photoreceptors  <cit> . stxbp <dig>  a protein implicated in vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release in this group is known to be highly expressed in retina  <cit> . these results indicate that gene expression in the later phase not only reflects late developing cell types in retina, rods, bipolar cells and müller cells, but also includes gene expression in early developed neurons such retinal ganglion cells. an additional file  <dig> provides detailed information of all the later phase expression genes and their relationship with rods.

few genes show a peak of expression between the two developmental phases
we found only a few genes whose peak of expression occurred between the two developmental phases. as shown in figure 7a, less than 1% of the genes possessed expression levels  <dig> fold higher than average signals at pn <dig> compared with other time points. only  <dig> genes were found with expression peaks in the cluster iii and iv , . as shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig> of these genes have no known function; the functions of the  <dig> other known genes are summarized in figure 7c. all  <dig> genes belong to six functional categories, cell cycle control, chromatin structure and modeling, metabolism, gene regulation, rna binding, and synaptogenesis. the expression levels of six of the genes were confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr using a different set of rna from that used in the microarray experiments . although ccnd <dig> and cdk2ap <dig> showed a steady decrease in expression from el  <dig>  other genes such as fh <dig>  sat <dig>  tmpo, and h3f3b showed a close agreement between microarray and rt-pcr analysis. among these categories, chromatin structure and modeling contained the most genes. these included h3f3b, also known as histone h <dig> , which is a replacement histone and is expressed in quiescent or terminally differentiated cell  <cit>  and dnmt3a which encodes a de novo methyltransferase  <cit> . dkk <dig>  as a wnt signaling antagonist is one of this group and shows highest expression in mouse brain, eye, and heart  <cit> . it shows differential expression during retina degeneration in rd <dig> mice  <cit>  and is silenced by cpg hypermethylation in some tumor cells  <cit> .

discussion
although there have been several genome-wide studies in the eye in recent years  <cit> , only one other has attempted a genome-wide analysis during a large segment of retina development. using serial analysis of gene expression , blackshaw et al. reported gene expression during retina development but focused on a set of genes expressed by mammalian rods  <cit> . dorrell et al. have shown a global gene expression analysis of the developing postnatal mouse retina  <cit> . other studies have focused on much more restricted aspects of retinal development and function. for example, a microarray analysis of the transcriptional network controlled by crx was performed by livesey et al, suggesting that cdna microarrays can be used successfully to define the transcriptional network in vertebrates  <cit> . diaz et al used a general cdna microarray to examine gene differential expression in the dorsal-ventral axis during mouse retina development  <cit> . mu and colleagues tested gene expression in the developing mouse retina using a small-scale e <dig>  retina microarray  <cit> . in the present study we used a microarray prepared from retinal cdna clones which are expressed during major mouse retina developmental stages, and profiled the gene expression of retina from prenatal to postnatal stages.

we found a low correlation coefficient of gene expression during retina development between the sage studies  <cit>  and our microarray. possible reasons for the low correlation are; the distinct experimental design; different experimental conditions, incomplete annotation, and lower copy numbers of sage sequence tags which we have noted that only about 50% of the genes have more than  <dig> sequence copies at any one of the time points studied in comparison to our microarray data . since only 5% negative correlation has been found between these two methods, we suggest that complementary methods might be beneficial for the understanding of genomic changes of the retina as a whole.

from the systems biology point view, functional genomic studies of development provide a first step towards obtaining a molecular classification of developmental stages during tissue and functional unit formation. the retina serves as a useful model for a variety of forebrain derived structures. its development has been extensively studied by many classical systems, such as histology  <cit> , immunohistochemistry  <cit> , and retroviral tracing  <cit> . recently blackshaw et al. showed a genomic view of retina development using sage and in situ hybridization methods and a taxonomic classification of developmental retina gene expression has been generated  <cit> . using hierarchical clustering, we have identified  <dig> individual gene expression clusters during mouse retina development. those clusters with distinct gene expression profiles, from cluster-i , cluster-ii , cluster-iii , cluster-iv , cluster-v  and cluster-vi  correspond to specific stages that have been identified by other methods  <cit> . among  <dig>  transcripts that changed significantly during development, approximately 2/ <dig> were expressed at high levels in the first three clusters and then declined whereas the other 1/ <dig> increased expression in the cluster-v and remained at the higher levels until at least cluster-vi. less than 1% of the genes observed showed a peak of expression between the two phases. it appears that cluster-iv at pn <dig> represents the beginning of a maturation and functional phase that correlates with the formation of the outer plexiform layer of mouse retina  <cit> . further analysis of each developmental cluster is expected to have an impact on the identification of specific functional genes at distinct stages during retina development, and understanding the mechanisms by which these genes shape specific developmental events.

through hierarchical clustering of microarray data and in silico go gene functional analysis, we noted that distinct gene populations are expressed before and after the pn <dig>  even though they may be in the same go functional clusters. genes characteristic of a proliferative undifferentiated neuroepithelium are not expressed or are only expressed at only low levels after the transition stage, whereas most of the genes characteristic of a functional retina are highly expressed de novo from the transition stage, indicating that different sets of genes are involved at the developmental and functional stages. it is likely that use of different genes for similar functions at different times in development is a reflection of the specific networks regulating gene expression that are active at each time. this phenomenon has been shown in previous observation with individual gene studies  <cit> , however the biphasic pattern have not been reported in any previous study.

rod photoreceptors constitute the large majority of retinal cells. most become postmitotic in the first few days after birth and undergo a large increase in gene expression as their outer segments form, beginning at about pn <dig>  we have examined whether the biphasic expression we observed could be due simply to the onset of rod gene transcription. although many genes selectively expressed in rods are found only in the maturation phase, this phase contains many other genes that, since they are still expressed in rd <dig> mutant retinas that have lost all rod photoreceptors, are probably expressed in other retinal cell types  <cit> . we found that less than 40% of genes in the later phase could be related to rods. while some others are known to be expressed in the other late developing cells, bipolar and müller glial cells, yet others are characteristic of retina ganglion and cone cells, which are earlier differentiating cell types. this would suggest that most, if not all, retinal cell types have similar biphasic patterns of gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a genome-wide view of common gene dynamics and a molecular classification of mouse retina development. it also provides a detailed comparison with a previous sage study. the results from such complementary studies will provide more accurate information for genomic studies of retina. although many genes have distinct expression patterns with their own peaks through development, only a few genes showed peak expression between the two expression phases. among those genes, a high frequency of cell cycle control and chromatin modification related genes were noted. we propose that large-scale changes in gene regulation during development might be related to cell cycle exit and chromatin remodeling.
