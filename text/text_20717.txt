BACKGROUND
the preferential and reversible oxidation of specific cysteine residues present in enzymes, transcription factors and receptors has been proposed to be the major mechanism by which oxidants may integrate into cellular signal transduction pathways  <cit> . the sulfhydryl  group of cysteine residues, especially when present in an environment that decreases its pka, can be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide , the main cellular reactive oxygen species. the major product of the reaction between a protein cysteinyl thiol and hydrogen peroxide is a protein sulfenic acid  <cit>  that, unless in a shielded environment, is a transient intermediate that undergoes a range of secondary reactions  <cit> . the protein sulfenic acid can form  mixed disulfides with low-molecular weight thiols, mainly glutathione ,  intramolecular disulfides when vicinal thiols are present,  intermolecular disulfides between proteins or  reversible condensation with an adjacent amide to form a sulfenylamide. all these oxidations are reversible and, therefore, provide a mechanism by which protein function may be controlled by changes in cellular h2o <dig> concentration. when the levels of oxidant exposure are higher further oxidation of cysteinyl sulfenic acids can occur, leading to the formation of cysteinyl sulfinic and sulfonic acids  <cit> , which is considered largely irreversible in vivo  <cit> . moreover, these higher levels of oxidative stress may often result in excessive disulfide bonding, and in the misfolding, aggregation, and degradation of proteins leading, eventually, to cell death  <cit> .

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  is a classic glycolytic enzyme that is active as a tetramer of identical  <dig> kda subunits catalyzing the oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to  <dig> -diphosphoglycerate by converting nad+ to nadh. more recently, gapdh emerged as a multifunctional protein with defined functions in numerous subcellular processes, namely a primary role in apoptosis and in a variety of critical nuclear pathways  <cit> . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  three related but not identical gapdh enzymes with different specific activities are encoded by unlinked genes designated tdh <dig>  tdh <dig> and tdh <dig>  <cit> . none of the tdh genes are individually essential for cell viability, but a functional copy of either tdh <dig> or tdh <dig> is required since tdh2Δtdh3Δ cells are not viable  <cit> .

studies with mammalian cells have identified gapdh as a target of oxidative modifications resulting in decreased activity following exposure to h2o <dig>  <cit> . gapdh has an active-site cysteine residue which, following exposure to h2o <dig>  can be oxidized to an intramolecular disulfide and cysteic acid  <cit>  and also undergo s-glutathionylation  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae growing in exponential phase, gapdh was also identified as a major target of s-glutathionylation  <cit>  and also carbonylation  <cit>  and a sharp decrease in its enzymatic activity was observed  <cit>  following exposure to h2o <dig>  in cell extracts exposed to h2o <dig> both thdh2p and thdh3p are s-glutathionylated, but in vivo only s-glutathionylation of thd3p is observed  <cit> .

studies of gapdh inactivation and s-glutathionylation in s. cerevisiae cells  <cit>  have been performed in the exponential phase of growth using bolus additions of high doses of h2o <dig> that cause high levels of cell death, and so it is difficult to assess the possible regulatory role of h2o <dig> on gapdh activity by inducing reversible gapdh thiol oxidation, including s-glutathionylation. therefore, our main aim with this study was to establish in s. cerevisiae cells at what levels, in the range of low to moderate h2o <dig> concentrations, is h2o <dig> able to cause an inhibition of gapdh activity due to reversible and irreversible oxidation of the enzyme. to achieve this, instead of the typical h2o <dig> bolus addition, we exposed cells to controlled steady-state levels of h2o <dig>  mimicking the physiological production of h2o <dig> in vivo. this methodology allows to study the biological effects of low to moderate levels of h2o <dig>  <cit>  and by using it we were able to show that in yeast the overall gapdh activity only decreases at high doses of h2o <dig>  we also characterized the differential expression of the three tdh isoenzymes when cells were exposed to h2o <dig> under our controlled conditions of h2o <dig> delivery. in stationary-phase cells tdh1p expression emerged as a target for regulation by low h2o <dig> levels.

RESULTS
what are regulatory h2o <dig> concentrations?
a high enough h2o <dig> dose will eventually trigger the oxidation of cysteine residues, and so it is important to define whether the doses at which h2o <dig> is observed to inhibit gapdh activity are either in the regulatory low range, or in the toxic high range of h2o <dig> concentrations.

to define what a low to moderate steady-state h2o <dig> dose is, the activity of catalase, an important antioxidant enzyme that removes h2o <dig>  was measured. in exponential phase cells, catalase activity was upregulated for a  <dig> μm steady-state h2o <dig> exposure and for  <dig> μm h2o <dig> there was a two-fold increase in catalase activity . as to stationary-phase, cells treated with h2o <dig> on the lower range of concentrations studied  showed an increase in catalase activity . this increase in catalase activity was modest when compared to that observed in exponential-phase cells, probably because catalase activity in stationary-phase cells is 15-fold higher than in exponential-phase cells, reflecting a probable higher formation of h2o <dig> due to mitochondrial respiration. however, for our purpose this increase in catalase activity observed at  <dig> μm steady-state h2o <dig> was sufficient to identify a range of concentrations where h2o <dig> triggers a regulatory response. s. cerevisiae has two catalases, peroxisomal catalase  and cytosolic catalase , encoded by the cta <dig> and ctt <dig> genes respectively, and both are known to be induced by h2o <dig>  <cit> . h2o2-dependent upregulation of ctt <dig> expression has been shown to be dependent on the transcription factors yap1p, skn7p  <cit>  and msn2p/msn4p  <cit>  and it should be pointed out that the minimum h2o <dig> concentration needed to activate those transcription factors, when using a bolus addition, was found to be  <dig> μm  <cit> .

to define what a high dose of h2o <dig> is, the survival of s. cerevisiae wild-type cells exposed to steady-state concentrations of h2o <dig> was determined. for exponential-phase cells, under our conditions, the value of  <dig> μm can be defined as the border between moderate and high toxic conditions because higher steady-state h2o <dig> concentrations lead to significant cell death  . for stationary-phase cells, doses up to  <dig> μm may be considered moderate because they did not alter cell survival, which is in agreement with the known higher resistance of these cells to h2o <dig> when compared to exponential-phase cells  <cit> .

in conclusion, steady-state h2o <dig> concentrations in the range  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm may be viewed as triggering a regulatory h2o <dig> response in s. cerevisiae.

low to moderate concentrations of h2o <dig> do not lead to changes in gapdh activity in s. cerevisiae exponential-phase cells
gapdh activity was determined with and without the reducing agent dtt in the assay medium. the difference in the enzyme activity in both assays measures gapdh reversible inactivation due either to s-glutathionylation, formation of a sulphenic acid or of an intramolecular disulfide. in control cells the activity of gapdh measured in the absence of dtt was approximately 10% lower than in the presence of dtt , indicating either that the enzyme was partially oxidized in vivo or that it became oxidized during protein extraction. this partial oxidation of gapdh in unstressed cells has been previously found  <cit> . if the reversible inactivation of gapdh induced by h2o <dig>  namely by s-glutathionylation, has an important role in the regulation of gapdh activity during oxidative stress it should be expected that a higher reversible inactivation of the enzyme would occur when cells are exposed to low to average h2o <dig> concentrations .

when exponential-phase cells were exposed to increasing steady-state h2o <dig> concentrations no changes in gapdh activity determined both in the presence and absence dtt were observed for h2o <dig> concentrations up to  <dig> μm . this dose is  <dig> times higher than the h2o <dig> concentration identified as being able to induce catalase activity and is close to the steady-state  <dig> μm h2o <dig> dose that induces a multi-factorial cellular response causing adaptation to h2o <dig>  <cit> . previous studies of gapdh inactivation by h2o <dig> in yeast were done with bolus additions  <cit> , which require the use of a much higher initial h2o <dig> concentration. when a typical bolus addition of  <dig> mm h2o <dig> was added to exponential-phase cells , after  <dig> min gapdh activity had decreased to 10% of that in control cells . part of this inactivation induced by the h2o <dig> bolus addition was due to reversible gapdh thiol oxidation since gapdh activity in h2o2-treated cells measured in the presence of dtt was about 47% of that in control cells . so, a much higher steady-state concentration of h2o <dig>  was used in order to try to obtain a similar gapdh inactivation to that observed when using a bolus addition of h2o <dig>  when exponential-phase cells were exposed to a steady-state  <dig> μm h2o <dig> concentration, gapdh activity showed a marked decrease  . however, it should be noted that similarly to what happens with a  <dig> mm bolus h2o <dig> addition  <cit> , cell survival when cells are subjected to a steady-state  <dig> μm h2o <dig> concentration is lower than 50% .

in conclusion, for cells in the exponential phase gapdh activity is largely unresponsive to low to moderate h2o <dig> levels, in opposition to a widely accepted view. gapdh activity does decrease, but only for h2o <dig> concentrations that cause significant cell death.

h2o <dig> does not inactivate irreversibly gapdh in s. cerevisiae stationary-phase cells
gapdh activity in stationary-phase cells is about 25% higher than in exponential-phase cells . no changes in gapdh activity were found for stationary-phase cells treated with steady-state h2o <dig> concentrations up to  <dig> μm  both in the presence and absence of dtt, when compared with control cells. however, for cells exposed to  <dig> μm h2o <dig> there was a significant difference in gapdh activity determined in the presence and absence of dtt, indicating a small increase in the gapdh reversible oxidation induced by h2o <dig>  nevertheless, this h2o <dig> concentration is much higher than the  <dig> μm, identified in figure  <dig> which induces catalase. therefore, gapdh may not be considered to be a sensitive target of h2o <dig> in stationary phase cells.

tdh2p/tdh3p expression is not altered by h2o <dig> in exponential-phase s. cerevisiae cells
up until now we have focused on the activity of gapdh as a whole. next we evaluate the pattern of expression of each of the three gapdh isoenzymes. to this end, 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immune detection was performed . previous studies have shown that in two-dimensional gels tdh2p and tdh3p slightly overlap, while tdh1p migrates in a different position  <cit> . as can be seen in figure  <dig> the mouse anti-gapdh  reacted only with tdh2p and tdh3p , while the rabbit anti-gapdh reacted with all three isoforms present in stationary-phase cells . tdh1p identification was confirmed using a tdh1Δ strain . tdh1p was not detected in exponential-phase cells , which is in agreement with previous studies  <cit>  where tdh1p has been described as a minor gapdh isoenzyme only expressed in the stationary phase of growth. tdh1p was also not detected when exponential-phase cells were exposed to  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm steady-state h2o <dig> . since tdh2p and tdh3p levels were difficult to obtain from the 2d-analysis, western blot analysis from sds-page using the mouse anti-gapdh followed by signal intensity analysis was used to quantify both tdh2p and tdh3p levels when cells were exposed to h2o <dig>  in figure  <dig> it can be seen that exposure of exponential-phase cells up to  <dig> μm h2o <dig> did not alter the levels of tdh2p/tdh3p expression. this contradicts observations obtained with higher h2o <dig> doses, where a downregulation of tdh2p/tdh3p de novo synthesis  <cit>  and tdh2p/tdh3p mrna steady-state levels  <cit>  was observed, and highlights the multitude of possible responses caused by different h2o <dig> doses.

h2o <dig> upregulates tdh1p expression and downregulates tdh2p/tdh3p expression in stationary-phase s. cerevisiae cells
unlike what happens in exponential-phase cells where exposure to h2o <dig> does not alter gapdh expression, in stationary-phase cells a slight downregulation of tdh2p/tdh3p expression was observed for higher h2o <dig> concentrations . in fact, after exposure to  <dig> μm h2o <dig> tdh2p/tdh3p steady-state levels were about 80% of those in control cells. on the other hand, tdh1p expression in stationary-phase cells was upregulated by h2o <dig> since tdh1p levels were  <dig>  fold higher in cells exposed to steady-state  <dig> μm h2o <dig> than in control cells . therefore, tdh1p emerges as a protein that is strongly induced by low concentrations of h2o <dig> in stationary-phase cells.

discussion
it has been established for a number of years that oxidation of particular proteins containing reactive cysteine residues, such as gapdh, occurs when mammalian and yeast cells are exposed to h2o <dig>  however, in most of these studies, cells are exposed to exogenous h2o <dig> concentrations several orders of magnitude higher  than the physiological concentration  <cit> , due to its rapid removal by intracellular catalases and peroxidases. therefore, protein oxidation and enzyme inactivation caused by h2o <dig> has been mostly established for situations when cells were under severe oxidative stress and already dying either by apoptosis or necrosis, and thus very far from a regulatory situation. much less is known  about the effect of h2o <dig> concentration ranges  where h2o <dig> may affect signaling processes and protein function through reversible changes in protein thiols redox state. in this work, a calibrated method of h2o <dig> delivery to cells was used where cells were exposed to steady-state concentrations of h2o <dig> throughout the experiment, which allows the use of much smaller concentrations of h2o <dig>  <cit> . this made possible to study for the first time in s. cerevisiae cells how low concentrations of h2o <dig> affect gapdh activity and expression. our study showed that gadph activity in s. cerevisiae cells, both in the exponential-phase and stationary-phase of growth, is not inhibited by exposure to exogenous low to moderate h2o <dig> levels. this was unexpected considering previous studies of gapdh inactivation by h2o <dig> in yeast  <cit>  and suggests that in yeast cells exposed to low to moderate h2o <dig> concentrations the enzymatic systems responsible for the maintenance of cellular protein thiols  <cit> , have enough activity to maintain the sh groups of the reactive cysteine residues in the gapdh active centre mostly in the reduced form, thus avoiding inactivation of the enzyme. also, s. cerevisiae exponential-phase cells response to high h2o <dig> doses includes the upregulation of the proteins involved in the glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems  <cit> , which are responsible for the reduction of protein disulfides.

stationary-phase cells have higher resistance to h2o <dig> than exponential phase cells which is in part due to the higher catalase activity  and also to a lower cellular permeability to h2o <dig>  <cit> . so, when exposed to the same exogenous h2o <dig> concentration stationary-phase cells have a lower intracellular h2o <dig> concentration than exponential-phase cells  <cit> . also, the levels of glutaredoxins  <cit>  and thioredoxins  <cit>  expression are upregulated in the stationary phase of growth. this probably partially explains why in stationary-phase cells overall gapdh activity is not inhibited for the whole range of h2o <dig> concentrations used in this work. unlike what happens for exponential-phase cells, where tdh2p and tdh3p levels are not altered by exposure to h2o <dig> and tdh1p is not detected, in stationary-phase cells tdh2p and tdh3p levels were slightly downregulated at higher h2o <dig> concentrations. in spite of this result, overall gapdh activity and total gapdh mrna steady-state levels in stationary-phase cells are not altered by h2o <dig> . a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that, in spite of the decrease in the total amount of tdh3p plus tdh2p, the relative proportion of tdh2p versus tdh3p is increased. it is known that the three isoenzymes have different kinetic constants since it has been determined that tdh3p has a two- to three-fold lower apparent vmax than tdh2p  <cit> . also, it can be hypothesized that tdh1p upregulation observed at low h2o <dig> concentrations is compensating for the decreased levels of tdh2p/tdh3p, the overall net result being that gapdh activity is maintained constant.

tdh1p levels have also been previously found to be induced by reductive stress caused by an excess of cytoplasmic nadh in an anaerobically grown gpd2Δ strain lacking one of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases  <cit> . this upregulation of tdh1p expression by changes in cellular redox state may be related to its function in signaling pathways, possibly the hog1p pathway. in fact, in schizosaccharomyces pombe, a recent study  <cit>  showed that in response to h2o <dig> stress, the cys- <dig> of tdh1p is transiently oxidized. this oxidation enhances the association of tdh1p with mcs4p  and mpr1p, a protein that transfers a phosphoryl group from the mak2/mak <dig> sensor histidine kinases activated by h2o <dig>  the equivalent pathway in s. cerevisiae is the hog1p pathway involved in the response to increased extracellular osmolarity, which is also activated by oxidative stress  <cit> .

in the last years the paradigm found in the literature is that gapdh is a sensitive protein target of h2o <dig> and that its inhibition by h2o <dig> is a controlled response advantageous for cells because it diverts glucose from the glycolytic pathway to the pentose phosphate pathway, thus increasing the availability of nadph for antioxidant enzymes  <cit> . in favor of such an hypothesis, a recent study  <cit>  found that h2o2-induced gapdh inactivation to about 20% of control resulted in an increase in the levels of the metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway. also, a mathematical model indicated that for those levels of gapdh inhibition there was a change in the nadph/nadp+ ratio from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with a steep increase in the ratio for levels of gapdh inactivation greater than about 40%. ralser et al.  <cit>  used that evidence as support of a model where gapdh functions as a cellular switch that reroutes the carbohydrate flux to maintain the cytoplasmic nadph/nadp+ equilibrium to counteract oxidative stress. however, as shown by this work, those levels of gapdh inactivation can only be attained under severe oxidative stress when cells are dying. therefore, this rerouting of the glycolytic carbohydrate flux due to gapdh inhibition, although it may be important in pathophysiological situations, is not a physiological regulatory response. moreover, the higher gapdh activity observed after exhaustion of carbon sources in stationary-phase cells when compared to glucose-based growth in exponential-phase cells argues against the rerouting of carbohydrate flux being an important physiological mechanism. this higher gapdh activity in stationary-phase cells also supports the paradigm  <cit>  that gapdh has other functions in the cell besides its role in glycolysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this work has shown that in s. cerevisiae gapdh activity is largely unresponsive to low to moderate doses of h2o <dig>  this highlights the importance of studies of h2o2-induced oxidative stress using concentrations closer to the physiological for determining the importance of protein oxidation phenomena in the regulation of cellular metabolism. most other studies of gapdh in yeast have used considerably higher concentrations of h2o <dig> than we used which lead to conclusions that are possibly only important in situations of necrosis and apoptosis. the notable exception to the lack of gapdh response to low h2o <dig> concentrations is the h2o2-induced upregulation of tdh1p expression in stationary-phase s. cerevisiae cells.
