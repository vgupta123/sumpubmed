BACKGROUND
the family of candida species, normally a harmless human commensal of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, can become a human pathogen under certain circumstances. mainly in hiv and immunocompromised patients, candida cause a wide range of infections and are the most prevalent pathogenic yeast. one key feature of these fungi is their ability to grow in three different morphologies: yeast, pseudohyphae and true hyphae  <cit> . this reversible switching from one form to another is dependent on environmental conditions like temperature, ph, nutritional status and external/internal concentration of cations  <cit> .

in general, pathogenic candida species are osmotolerant yeasts and can grow, with the exception of candida dubliniensis  <cit> , at relatively high nacl concentrations, although the presence of salt was shown to negatively influence several virulence traits of candida albicans  <cit> . recent experiments also suggest a relationship between the formation of c. albicans hyphae and the intracellular concentration of potassium  <cit> . nevertheless, the regulation of intracellular potassium and sodium concentrations in candida species has not been studied in detail.

yeast species in general have several transport systems in their plasma membranes at their disposal to maintain homeostasis in alkali metal cations, i.e. a high ratio between potassium  and toxic sodium concentrations  <cit> . among these transport systems, na+/h+ antiporters play an important role. most yeasts that have so far been studied  possess only one type of this antiporter in their plasma membranes, which efficiently transports both sodium and potassium cations from the cells, as well as their analogues lithium and rubidium  <cit> . a few yeast species  have two antiporters of this family at their disposal, one of them with a substrate preference for sodium and lithium, the other preferring potassium and rubidium  <cit> .

the na+/h+ antiporter that has been studied the most so far is from s. cerevisiae, encoded by the nha <dig> gene, and has  <dig> predicted trans-membrane domains and a very long hydrophilic c-terminus  <cit> . beside its function in removing toxic na+ from cells and maintaining potassium homeostasis, it is involved in several other cellular functions such as regulating intracellular ph  <cit> , cell volume  <cit> , plasma membrane potential  <cit>  and the cell cycle  <cit> , and it participates in the cell response to osmotic shock  <cit> . the nha1p orthologs from c. albicans and candida tropicalis cacnh1p and ctcnh1p, respectively, were functionally characterized upon heterologous expression in s. cerevisiae. both showed the same broad substrate specificity as scnha1p  <cit> . the deletion of cnh <dig> in c. albicans results in cell sensitivity to high external potassium concentrations  <cit>  and under some conditions causes slight changes in cell morphology  <cit> .

in this work we compared the tolerance of four different pathogenic candida species to alkali metal cations, performed a search for nha1/cnh <dig> antiporter-encoding orthologs in their genomes, and characterized the transport properties of the na+/h+ antiporters from the most and least tolerant species, c. parapsilosis and c. dubliniensis respectively.

RESULTS
candida species differ in their halotolerance
according to the literature  <cit> , c. dubliniensis is relatively sodium sensitive, whereas c. parapsilosis was shown to tolerate high nacl concentrations  <cit> . in order to estimate the tolerance of candida species to different alkali metal cations, the growth of four candida species and a s. cerevisiae wild type  in the presence of increasing concentrations of various salts was estimated. in the absence of salts, s. cerevisiae cells grew more slowly than all four candida species, and also the growth of c. parapsilosis was not as robust as with the other three candida species . all yeast species grew equally well in the presence of lower salt concentrations  but as the amount of alkali-metal-cation on the plates increased, important differences were observed. of the tested candida species, c. dubliniensis had the lowest tolerance to all of the tested salts, it is not able to grow when the salt concentrations are above  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm kcl or  <dig> mm licl. nevertheless, c. dubliniensis is more sodium, potassium and rubidium tolerant than s. cerevisiae, but is much more sensitive to toxic lithium cations . also, the lithium sensitivity of c. glabrata is higher than that of s. cerevisiae but c. glabrata cells can grow in much higher concentrations of the other salts than s. cerevisiae cells . c. albicans and c. parapsilosis are the most halotolerant species, and c. parapsilosis seems to grow even better in the presence of high salt concentrations than c. albicans . to summarize, the four candida species have not only different sensitivity to nacl, as published previously  <cit>  but they differ in their tolerance to alkali metal cations in general. c. albicans and c. parapsilosis are highly halotolerant and c. dubliniensis is halosensitive.

comparison of candida cnh <dig> genes and encoded antiporters
a search in databases revealed the existence of open reading frames homologous to the cacnh <dig> gene in the genomes of c. dubliniensis, c. glabrata and c. parapsilosis. in these species, just one homologous sequence was found, suggesting that their plasma-membrane na+/h+ antiporters have a broad substrate specificity to alkali metal cations, similar to those of c. albicans and c. tropicalis. we named the identified orthologous genes according to their species of origin, cdcnh <dig>  cgcnh <dig> and cpcnh <dig>  the cdcnh <dig> gene is  <dig> nt  long, cgcnh <dig> has  <dig> nt , and the cpcnh <dig> gene is composed of  <dig> nt . neither of them have any introns.

the predicted protein structures of these three antiporters were compared with the two candida antiporters that have already been characterized, cacnh <dig> and ctcnh <dig>  comparison of the protein length and predicted structure of the cnh <dig> proteins from five candida species and s. cerevisiae revealed that cpcnh1p is the longest and c. dublinienis antiporter the shortest member of the candida na+/h+antiporters' subfamily . for all candida proteins, the kyte-doolittle method predicted a similar structure to scnha1p with highly conserved n-termini and  <dig> trans-membrane sections . on the other hand, they differ in the length and composition of their hydrophilic c-termini, as do the antiporters from non-candida yeast species  <cit> . the most significant is the difference in length  between the c-termini of cpcnh1p , cacnh1p  and cdcnh1p . of the analyzed proteins, cacnh1p and cdcnh1p show the highest sequence identity in all parts of the protein, though the hydrophobic trans-membrane domains and connecting loops are highly conserved  in all candida antiporters except for cgcnh1p . c. glabrata cnh1p is more similar to s. cerevisiae nha1p than to the antiporters from other candida species in all the features analyzed, which corresponds to the phylogenetic relationships among these yeast species  <cit> .

though the highest divergence from identity was found in the c-termini of all the compared antiporters, the existence of six conserved c-terminal regions described previously  <cit>  was also confirmed in c.dubliniensis, c. parapsilosis and c. glabrata species . a new, approximately  <dig> aa-long conserved region srsrrsykddprkvyahr  preceding conserved region no.  <dig>  <cit> ; was found in the four candida species, except for c. glabrata.

both the c. dubliniensis and c. parapsilosis species belong to the group of yeasts in which the ctg codon encodes a serine and not a leucine, as in other yeast species   <cit> . one ctg codon exists at aa position  <dig> in cpcnh <dig>  this serine  <dig> is localized in the antiporter's hydrophilic c-terminus and not in the membrane part of the protein. it is localized in a small weakly conserved area where at a similar position cdcnh1p  and ctcnh1p  also have a serine and cacnh1p  has an isoleucine.

heterologous expression of candida cnh1ps in s. cerevisiae bw31a cells and its phenotype
in order to 1) verify whether the identified and analysed open reading frames encode functional plasma-membrane alkali-metal-cation/proton antiporters, and 2) elucidate whether the species' salt tolerance could reflect the activity of these antiporters, corresponding dna fragments from the most and least salt tolerant species, c. parapsilosis and c. dubliniensis respectively, were expressed in a s. cerevisiae mutant lacking its own export systems for alkali metal cations . the lack of both na+-atpases, ena1- <dig> and the na+/h+ antiporter nha <dig> renders these cells extremely sensitive to higher external concentrations of salts, and almost no efflux of sodium or potassium cations from them is observable. the functional expression of heterologous sodium and/or potassium exporters in bw31a cells has clear phenotypes of an increased salt tolerance and measurable alkali metal cation efflux  <cit> .

the cdcnh <dig> and cpcnh <dig> genes amplified from genomic dnas were cloned behind the scnha <dig> promoter and expressed from multicopy vectors, as were the genes scnha <dig> and cacnh <dig>  <cit> , which served as positive controls in our study. thus all four antiporters were expressed under the same conditions  which should ensure similar antiporters' levels in cells. empty yep <dig> and pgru <dig> vectors served as negative controls. the functionality of all the constructs were first tested in drop experiments, which showed that 1) the presence of the constructs did not influence the growth rate of cells in standard media, i.e. the heterologous expression of these membrane proteins was not toxic for s. cerevisiae, and 2) the expression of both gfp-tagged and non-tagged cdcnh <dig> and cpcnh <dig> proteins brought about the same ability to grow on  <dig> mm nacl or  <dig> mm kcl, as did the positive controls with scnha <dig> and cacnh <dig> proteins, whereas the cells without antiporters were not able to grow . this result also confirmed that the c-terminal gfp-tagging did not influence the activity of the antiporters. in order to estimate the substrate specificity and transport capacity of the antiporters, bw31a cells expressing the four antiporters or transformed with an empty vector were spotted on a series of ynb plates containing increasing nacl, kcl, licl and rbcl concentrations. cells expressing cpcnhp1p were able to grow in the highest concentrations of salts, as did cells expressing cacnh1p. both these candida antiporters conferred a slightly higher tolerance to the cells than equivalent expression of the native s. cerevisiae antiporter, nha1p . the tolerance of cells expressing cdcnh1p to high external potassium and rubidium was almost the same as for cells expressing cpcnhp1p and cacnh1p , but their tolerance to toxic cations was significantly lower, only  <dig> mm nacl, and there was no increase in licl tolerance compared to cells with the empty vector .

the proton-antiport mechanism of these cnh <dig> proteins was verified in a series of drop tests on plates with various ph values . as was previously thought, the cells expressing antiporters showed the highest salt tolerance  when grown at lower external ph, i.e. in conditions where the proton gradient across the plasma membrane is the highest. surprisingly, the expression of both the s. cerevisiae and c. dubliniensis antiporters did not increase the cell tolerance to lithium cations at ph  <dig> , suggesting that li+ was not recognized as their substrate under these conditions. on the other hand, all four antiporters were partially active, even at an externally neutral ph  <dig> , as their presence enabled the cells to support higher salt concentrations. this detailed study confirmed again that cdcnh1p has the least ability to improve the salt tolerance of cells .

maximum salt concentrations  allowing growth of s. cerevisiae bw31a cells  on ynb media with various ph values.

localization of cdcnh <dig> and cpcnh <dig> antiporters in s. cerevisiae cells
as mentioned above, c-terminal gfp-tagging of the cdcnh <dig> and cpcnh <dig> proteins did not affected their functionality. both antiporters improved the cell salt tolerance to a similar degree as the non-tagged versions, and fluorescence microscopy localized them to the plasma membrane of s. cerevisiae bw31a cells  and not to the membranes of intracellular organelles. this result indicates a high probability of the same localization in their organisms of origin, as was previously shown for c. albicans cnh1p  <cit> .

western blot analysis of antiporters' amount in cells
to verify whether the use of the same vector and promoter for expression ensures similar levels of the four antiporters in bw31a cells, the gfp-tagged proteins were visualized on western blots. fig.  <dig> shows that 1) the size of sc and cp antiporters was alike, similarly as the size of ca and cd transporters  the quantity of antiporters in extracts of exponentially growing cells was similar, the highest amount apparently being observed for cdcnh1p and the lowest one for cpcnh <dig> antiporter. the analysis was repeated three times with the same result. the fluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis confirmed that the observed low activity of cdcnh1p and the high activity of cpcnh <dig> antiporter did not reflect different protein levels in the cells.

efflux of na+ and k+ from bw31a cells expressing various antiporters
to confirm the results from drop test experiments and to determine the activity and efflux rate of cdcnh1p and cpcnh1p, the efflux of k+ and na+ was directly measured. the loss of k+ from bw31a cells expressing c. dubliniensis or c. parapsilosis antiporters was measured directly; to measure na+ efflux, cell preloading with  <dig> mm nacl was necessary . cells expressing the cacnh <dig> antiporter served as positive, and cells transformed with an empty vector as negative controls, respectively. the initial internal concentration of k+ in exponentially growing cells was almost the same in all strains, in the representative experiment about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol - <dig>  after preloading, cells contained  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol - <dig> na+. as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  cpcnh1p exported na+ and k+ much more efficiently than cdcnh1p. within  <dig> minutes, cells with cpcnh1p lost 80% of their internal sodium and 32% of their potassium compared to cells with cdcnh1p, which over the same period only lost 38% of their sodium and 20% of their potassium. the c. albicans antiporter was the most effective, exporting 82% of its host cells' sodium and 55% of their potassium in  <dig> min, which agrees with previously published results  <cit> . the na+ efflux curves for cacnh1p and cpcnh1p are very similar and almost exponential; most of the sodium is exported in about  <dig> minutes. the efflux of sodium via cdcnh1p is linear and slow. the sodium efflux via all three antiporters is faster than their potassium efflux, though the initial intracellular concentration of k+ is much higher than that of na+, approx.  <dig> vs.  <dig> mm. these results suggest that the candida antiporters have, at least upon heterologous expression in s. cerevisiae, a higher affinity for sodium than for potassium cations.

the total loss  of na+and k+was measured over  <dig> min. the values are the average of three independent experiments, each consisting of three samples per time point, the initial concentrations of cations were: k+,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol -1; na+,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol - <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the variable sensitivity of candida species to nacl has been observed and exploited previously, mainly in connection with the original niche of the species, e.g. the high nacl tolerance of c. parapsilosis strains isolated from sea water or hypersaline brines  <cit>  or in clinical microbiological tests aiming to distinguish among candida species . in this work, we performed a series of tests to characterize the tolerance of four different pathogenic candida species to different alkali metal cations, and addressed the question of whether the observed differences in salt tolerance could be based on the transport activity and/or specificity of candidas' plasma-membrane na+/h+ antiporters. our results showed clearly that, besides differences in their tolerance to sodium, the four species tested also differ in their sensitivity to highly toxic lithium and their tolerance of high external concentrations of non-toxic potassium cations . c. glabrata and c. dubliniensis are the most sensitive to li+ cations, the latter being the least alkali-metal-cation tolerant of the species tested.

to elucidate the role of na+/h+ antiporters in candidas' salt tolerance, we isolated and heterologously expressed genes encoding putative antiporters in the most and the least tolerant species, c. parapsilosis and c. dubliniensis. the functional characterization of these encoded proteins in an s. cerevisiae mutant lacking its own alkali-metal-cation exporters revealed that both antiporters have broad substrate specificity. they recognize at least four different cations , but transport them with varying capacities and/or affinities. c. parapsilosis and c. albicans cnh <dig> proteins are very efficient transporters and their capacities exceed that of s. cerevisiae nha1p. on the other hand, the c. dubliniensis antiporter has a much lower transport activity and its ability to recognize and transport the smallest cation, toxic lithium, is very limited compared to the other two candida antiporters . the large difference between the transport activities of the evolutionary close c. albicans and c. dubliniensis cnh <dig> antiporters is worth noting, as these two proteins shared the highest level of identity . their core membrane section  is almost 99% identical and their n-termini, composed of  <dig> aa residues, are 100% identical. these two antiporters differ slightly  in the length and composition of their hydrophilic c-termini. whether the observed transport capacities are based on the c-terminal difference remain to be established, though previous studies showed that the c-termini of yeast na+/h+ antiporters are not the most important factor in this activity  <cit>  and that a single amino-acid exchange in one of the transmembrane domains can significantly influence both the substrate specificity and transport capacity of the antiporter  <cit> .

though the c. parapsilosis cnh <dig> antiporter mediates a high and efficient sodium efflux from s. cerevisiae cells , its physiological role in c. parapsilosis remains to be established. a recent study  <cit>  showed that the cnh <dig> antiporter is mainly important in potassium homeostasis in c. albicans cells and its role in na+ detoxification is rather marginal.

the differences observed in alkali-metal-cation tolerance between c. dubliniensis and c. parapsilosis/c. albicans species were also found upon testing the alkali-metal-cation tolerance of s. cerevisiae cells expressing the antiporters of these three species. efflux measurements confirmed that the differing tolerances of s. cerevisiae cells were based on the differing transport activities of the candida antiporters. altogether, our results suggest that the activity of plasma-membrane na+/h+ antiporters is one of the factors determining the tolerance to high external concentrations of alkali metal cations in pathogenic candida species.
