BACKGROUND
wild emmer wheat, triticum dicoccoides, the progenitor of bread and pasta wheats, presumably originated in and adaptively diversified from, northeastern israel into the near east fertile crescent  <cit> . in this center of diversity, wild emmer wheat harbors rich genetic diversity and resources  <cit> . previous studies in t. dicoccoides and other cereals have shown significant nonrandom adaptive molecular genetic differentiation at single and multilocus structures in either protein-coding regions or randomly amplified polymorphic dnas among micro-ecological environments  <cit> . it was also determined that wild emmer wheat is genetically variable and that the genetic differentiation of populations included regional and local patterns with sharp genetic differentiation over short distances  <cit> . genetic polymorphisms of α- and β-amylase in wild emmer wheat have been characterized, and it was found that diversity of climatic and edaphic natural selection, rather than stochasticity or migration, was the major evolutionary force driving amylase differentiation  <cit> .

the estimates of molecular diversity derived from pcr-based techniques such as amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism , microsatellites , single nucleotide polymorphism , and sequence comparisons are several-fold higher than enzymatic diversity  <cit> . a substantial private and public effort has been undertaken to characterize snps tightly associated for genetic diversity. snps are identified in ests , thus the polymorphisms could be directly used to map functional and expressed genes, rather than dna sequences derived from conventional rapd and aflp techniques, which are typically not functional genes  <cit> . the majority of snps in coding regions  are single-base substitutions, which may or may not result in amino acid changes. some csnps may alter a functionally important amino acid residue, and these are of interest for their potential links with phenotypes  <cit> .

α-amylase is a family of enzymes that hydrolyze α-d--glucan linkages and play an important role in the carbohydrate metabolism of many autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms  <cit> . heterotrophic organisms use α-amylase primarily to digest starch in their food sources  <cit> . several kinds of α-amylase and proteinase inhibitors in seeds and vegetative organs act to regulate the numbers of phytophagous insects  <cit> . α-amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for the control of seed weevils as these insects are highly dependent on starch as an energy source  <cit> . in cereal seeds, α-amylase inhibitor proteins with 120– <dig> amino acids, which include trypsin inhibitors, as well as α-amylase inhibitors, can be grouped into one large family on the basis of the homology between their amino acid sequences  <cit> . in this family, the dimeric α-amylase inhibitor has been well characterized. for weevil control, α-amylase inhibitors could be manipulated through plant genetic engineering. however, many insects have several α-amylases that differ in specificity, and successful utilization of a food source is dependent on the expression of a α-amylase for which there is no specific inhibitor  <cit> . the dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes were located on chromosome 3bs and 3ds; there was no known evidence of a homoeologous locus or loci on chromosome 3as of the polyploid wheats  <cit> . therefore, the tetraploid wheats, which are lacking the d genome, have only the inhibitor genes on chromosome 3bs  <cit> .

evolutionary pressures of various kinds have often been hypothesized to cause active and rapid evolutionary changes. in a co-evolving system of plant-insect interactions, plants synthesize a variety of toxic proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous molecules for their protection against insects  <cit> . proteinase inhibitors are therefore a potential model system in which to study basic evolutionary processes, such as functional diversification  <cit> .

it is well established that multiple forms of proteins are active on exogenous or endogenous α-amylases in the wheat kernel, and proteinaceous dimeric α-amylase inhibitors could function against α-amylase from various origins  <cit> . it is known that the bulk of wheat albumins consist of a few amylase iso-inhibitor families that are very likely phylogenetically related and coded by a small number of parental genes  <cit> . the α-amylase inhibitors have long been proposed as possible important weapons against pests whose diets make them highly dependent on α-amylase activity. in vitro and in vivo trials using α-amylase inhibitors, including those made under field conditions, have now fully confirmed their potential for increasing yields by controlling insect populations  <cit> .

two conflicting views confront ecologists and evolutionary biologists on the degree of symmetry in interactions between plants and phytophagous insects  <cit> . the symmetrical view holds that insects and plants have strong effects on one another's evolutionary and ecological dynamics. the asymmetrical view acknowledges that plants have major effects on insects but claims that insects seldom impose significant effects on plants  <cit> . plant defense mechanisms have been the subject of intense investigation  <cit> . the genome shaping events and processes occurring at dimeric α-amylase inhibitor gene loci from the b and s genomes of wheat and aegilops section sitopsis, respectively, have been characterized. a phylogenetic median-joining network of the haplotypes and a neighbor-joining tree analysis have indicated that the inhibitor gene sequences from common wheat and t. dicoccoides are closely related to those from ae. speltoides  <cit> . however, little is known about their evolution under the influence of ecology. the molecular diversity of α-amylase inhibitor genes, as well as their divergence among  <dig> populations of wild emmer wheat from israel, was investigated to gain insight into the correlation between plant defense proteinaceous inhibitors and ecological factors.

RESULTS
isolation of the orf of dimeric α-amylase inhibitors
using two cloning primers, genomic pcr amplifications were conducted, and one desired dna band was detected in each accession of wild emmer wheat. cloning the fragments yielded  <dig> positive clones from  <dig> accessions , which were subsequently sequenced . only three out of  <dig> dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes had a common three bp deletion, and those three genes were obtained from one accession derived from mt. hermon, whereas the other cloned fragments had  <dig> bp long . it was predicted that all of the 426-bp sequences would encode functional dimeric α-amylase inhibitors. alignment of the gene sequences from emmer wheat with sequences from the species of aegilops section sitopsis , ae. tauschii, einkorn wheats, and common wheat clearly indicated that the emmer wheat sequences were derived from the b genome  <cit> .

snp and haplotype analyses of dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes
the frequency of snps in the dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes in emmer wheat was  <dig> out of  <dig>  bases, which was higher than the snps observed for kunitz-type α-amylase inhibitor and α-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor genes in barley and dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes in common wheat  <cit> . among the  <dig> nucleotides, there were  <dig> conserved positions and  <dig> variable positions among the  <dig> α-amylase inhibitor genes sequenced from  <dig> accessions.

a total of  <dig> haplotypes were revealed by sequence analysis ;  <dig> of these were each found in only a single sequence. haplotype  <dig> was observed at the highest frequency, i.e., in  <dig> gene sequences, followed by haplotype  <dig> in  <dig> sequences .

the relationship between snps and amino acid changes in the α-amylase inhibitor proteins is summarized in table  <dig>  the  <dig> snps resulted in  <dig> amino acid substitutions. the position of each snp in the sequence, whether the predicted change was synonymous  or non-synonymous , was determined. forty percent of snps were found to occur at the third codon position, and as expected, most of these were synonymous . a number of changes were also identified in codon positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and these accounted for more than 95% of the non-synonymous changes . in total, 60% of the snps resulted in non-synonymous changes.

primer design and snp mining of wild emmer wheat
using the information from the  <dig> snps identified in the α-amylase inhibitor genes,  <dig> primers  were successfully designed to detect the snps in  <dig> accessions from  <dig> populations. the primers, with the snp  at the 3' end and an extra mismatched nucleotide  on the third nucleotide from the end are listed in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> snps were detected with the  <dig> snp markers from position  <dig> to  <dig> of the α-amylase inhibitor gene, and the size of the amplified fragments ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the data was then organized in terms of genotypic frequencies  to assess the population structure.

*snp positions were on the 3' end of the primers and are identified in bold letters. extra mismatched nucleotides were also incorporated in the primers .

there were only  <dig> and  <dig> accessions from yehudiyya and achihood, respectively. thus, the data for yehudiyya and achihood were not used in further analyses. positive fragment frequency for each primer in the  <dig> populations is listed additional file  <dig> 

genetic diversity and distance of α-amylase inhibitor genes
some genetic parameters of the  <dig> populations of wild emmer wheat are summarized in table  <dig>  the proportion of polymorphic loci p , the expected heterozygosity he, and shannon's information index of the  <dig> populations of wild emmer wheat were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the values of he ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the population of kokhav hashahar had the highest value of he , followed by the population of rosh-pinna, whereas the population from daliyya was characterized by the lowest he value of  <dig> .

the genetic distances  were calculated for comparisons of all  <dig> populations based on the positive fragment of snp markers among all population pairs . the highest genetic distance  was obtained between populations of kokhav hashahar and daliyya, whereas the most related populations were qazzrin and gamla with a genetic distance of  <dig> . however, lower d values  were observed between some populations from different areas, and, for the most part, the estimates of d value were geographically independent. large genetic distances and sharp genetic differentiation over long geographic distances could be found. for example, kokhav hashahar in southern israel had higher d values with the populations from gamla , nahef , beit-oren , daliyya , and bat-shelomo  in northeast israel.

principle components & multiple regression analysis of environmental variables and snps
to assess if some of the ecological factors are correlated to each other, principle components analysis  was carried out using  <dig> ecological factors as variables. a combination of the first four components could give us a high cumulative percent  according to the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix , which could be used to explain the ecological associations. the main ecological factors of the first component were rd and ev  that could give  <dig> % eigenvalues, and the second component could give  <dig> % eigenvalues . and from pca analysis, it was known that the accessions from mt. hermon were affected the most by ecological factors .

after analyzed of the factors by projection of the variables on the factor-plane  and consulted the correlations of these factors ,  <dig> independent ecological factors were chosen. and then, multiple regression analysis was done using these  <dig> factors to investigate the relationship between environmental variables and snps.

the geographical, temperature, water, and solar radiation factors in table  <dig>  singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the diversity in the snps . the best variable predictors of p, he, and shannon's information index, significantly explaining  <dig>  –  <dig>  of the variance, was the water availability factor hu-an. the combination of three variable predictors accounting for geographic and water availability factors hu-an, ev, and lt  accounted significantly  for about  <dig>  of the genetic diversity. the addition of a fourth variable predictor, rad , or sh  to the first three factors accounted for approximately  <dig>  of the diversity  .

population numbers and ecological factors definitions was according to nevo and beiles  <dig> 

* populations yehudiyya  and achihood  do not have enough accessions to do further statistical analysis.

discussion
snps in the α-amylase inhibitor genes
in sequence comparisons, the  <dig> dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes from wild emmer wheat, had a high level of similarity, indicating that the primary structure of these genes was similar to those of known dimeric α-amylase inhibitors  <dig>   and  <dig>  . the predicted protein sequence of the  <dig> cloned α-amylase inhibitor genes from wild emmer wheat showed the presence of  <dig> cys, which were the amino acids most important to the structure and function of the mature protein  <cit> . changes in structure of α-amylase inhibitor proteins would affect their specificity and activity against different mammalian and insect α-amylase  <cit> . a comparison of sequence between members of the α-amylase inhibitors  <dig>  group indicated that not only the  <dig> cys residues were of importance, but also asp <dig>  lys <dig>  asn <dig>  glu <dig>  ser <dig>  leu <dig>  trp <dig>  his <dig>  and gln <dig> were important to form the structure of those inhibitors  <cit> . most of the snps did not occur at highly conserved positions, which ensures that the α-amylase inhibitors keep their correct 3d structure to combine with the α-amylase. however, gln <dig>  his <dig>  ser <dig>  leu <dig>  val <dig>  and asp <dig> were changed by snps in some of the cloned α-amylase inhibitor genes . it is noteworthy that only the α-amylase inhibitors from the d genome of ae. tauschii and common wheat, which were closely related to inhibitor  <dig> , had the his <dig>  <cit> , whereas the his <dig> was replaced by asp or tyr in 98% of the inhibitor genes from wild emmer wheat.

genetic diversity of the α-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat
genetic diversity of the α-amylase inhibitor genes of  <dig> wild emmer wheat accessions from  <dig> populations in israel were revealed by  <dig> snp markers. individual accessions from different populations could not be distinguished clearly by the sequences of their α-amylase inhibitor genes; whereas, using the snp-specific primers, all wild emmer wheat populations were distinguishable, even within closely related populations originating in proximate geographic locations . our results demonstrated that the polymorphism of α-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat correlated with the ecogeographic distribution of the accessions. the results suggest that the gene was subjected to strong natural selection. the observations were consistent with previous results obtained with high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits, which are also seed storage proteins  <cit> . in other studies, dna diversity of glutenin subunits was shown to be correlated to environmental factors and variation  <cit> .

the genetic diversity profiles in this study were compared with earlier allozyme studies  <cit> , rapd loci  <cit> , and with the microsatellite studies  <cit>  in wild emmer wheat populations. although the snp markers in the protein-coding genes yielded lower values of diversities than other methods, the results in this study were able to reveal the correlations of snp variations in specific functional genes with ecological factors.

central populations used in this study were collected in warm, humid environments on the golan plateau and near the sea of galilee. marginal steppic populations were collected across a wide geographic area on the northern, eastern, and southern borders of wild emmer distribution involving hot, cold, and xeric peripheries, while marginal mesic  populations were collected from the western border of wild emmer distribution  <cit> . the present study included  <dig> accessions collected from  <dig> different sites in israel and covered a wide range of ecogeographical conditions across the distribution range of the species. specific snp positions detected in the α-amylase inhibitor genes were found to be highly effective in distinguishing genotypes and populations of wild emmer wheat originating from diverse ecogeographic sites in israel. high levels of polymorphic loci , expected heterozygosity , and shannon's information index  with high genetic distance values between populations could be found . these results suggest that the genetic variation at these snp positions in the dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes was somewhat ecologically determined for these populations.

genetic distance versus geographical distance
the relationship between snps' genetic distance and geographical distance was investigated, and it was found that the estimates of genetic distance  were geographically independent, as was previously found for allozymes, rapd loci, and microsatellite analyses  <cit> . quite often it is easier to find a greater genetic difference between proximal populations than among populations that are far apart. this was clearly demonstrated by local short transects of different soil types at tabigha  <cit>  and by the micro-differences of sun-shade differentiation at yehudiyya  <cit> . sharp genetic divergence  over very short geographic distances against small genetic divergence  between large geographically distances were observed in wild emmer populations . for example, it was shown that the genetic distance obtained between the population at gitit and the population at kokhav hashahar , with d =  <dig> , was  <dig>  times higher than the genetic distance between the population at mt. hermon and the population at j'aba . in other words, the distance between the first  <dig> populations was 1/ <dig> of the distance between the second  <dig> populations .

the genetic structure of wild emmer wheat populations in israel is mosaic  <cit> . this patchy genetic distribution appears to reflect the underlying ecological heterogeneity at both micro- and macro-scales  <cit> . thus the higher polymorphisms and genetic variations of dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes within and between populations could be explained by natural selection.

ecological genetics of snps in dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes
natural populations of wild emmer are highly polymorphic in morphological characters, as well as for various economically important traits  <cit> . although major collection areas such as mt. hermon, rosh pinna, gamla, bat-shelomo, and tabigha are at similar longitude and latitude, they differ significantly in altitude. these locations, for example, are respectively at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> m above sea level . along with these features, several other environmental factors differ for these locations  <cit> .

in this study, the mean number of p, he, and shannon's information index were negatively correlated with the three water factors and positively correlated with the other six factors . it was noteworthy that the significant ecological factors , revealed by a spearman rank correlations matrix between allozyme and climate, were similar to the results in this study  <cit> . this similarity might be because the correlation between ecological factors and coding sequences or proteins  is different from the non-coding sequences. moreover, the correlation between photosynthetic performance and ecogeographical variables indicated that ecological factors, e.g., sharav , dewy nights , radiation , rainy days , altitude , and latitude  were distinctly correlated with photosynthetic factors  <cit> . photosynthetic efficiency needs specific ecological factors, especially light.

in this study, the snp variations showed significant correlations with ecological factors . geographical, temperature, water availability, edaphic, biotic and solar radiation factors , singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the diversity in the snps of α-amylase inhibitor genes. the association of these factors with snps was similar to the association of latitude/altitude with rapd and microsatellite diversity  <cit> . it could be explained by the change in ecological factors, i.e., al, the sharp gradient of climatic conditions from north to south in israel, with increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability towards the semiarid zones in southern israel. also, the ecological factors used in this study were not representative of all the possible components involved in the determination of the real climate.

the snps that could determine the amino acid changes in the mature protein of α-amylase inhibitors were of great importance. six specific primers  were designed, based on the snps at five positions associated with amino acids changes . it was shown that these snps were significantly correlated with water availability factors , temperature factors , geographical factors , and solar radiation  better than the other factors . environmental stress can greatly influence plant susceptibility to herbivores and pathogens, and drought stress can promote outbreaks of fungal diseases and plant-eating insects  <cit> . louda and collinge  reported guild-specific insect responses following soil water manipulations, and larssou  has clearly articulated why the actual response of insect herbivores to plant stress should be feeding-guild specific  <cit> . the results in this study indicated that water availability is the main factor that could affect the dimeric α-amylase inhibitor genes and, thus, the concordance between insect and plant. recently, based on snp analysis, highly significant correlations were also found between diversity at the barley isa locus  and key water variables  plus latitude  <cit> . the soil fungi may influence the survival of wild barley seed in soil and the subsequent establishment of plant populations. the higher diversity of soil fungi in dry environments may select for a higher diversity of defense proteins encoded by the isa locus in the seed  <cit> .

the herbivore insect and the level of herbivore pressure may vary with ecological factors, so that the wheat is under different herbivore-related selection pressures at each site. different environmental pressures at each site directly related to the climate, but the wheat alpha-amylase inhibitors responded indirectly to those factors. there might be some evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the differences in diversity of α-amylase inhibitors and water factors. historical events may have given rise to diversity patterns that correlate coincidentally with the ecogeographical variables tested in this study. however, probability would suggest it is far more likely that the variation in genetic diversity of this gene between populations is a product of selective forces. selection pressure at this locus is likely to be caused by insects.

CONCLUSIONS
the populations of wild emmer wheat showed great diversity in dimeric α-amylase inhibitors, both between and within populations. we suggest that snp markers are useful for the estimation of genetic diversity of protein-coding genes in wild emmer wheat. these results show significant correlations between snps in the α-amylase inhibitor genes and ecological diversities. ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the snps, and the snps could be classified into several categories as ecogeographical predictors. a sharp genetic divergence  over very short geographic distances against small genetic divergence  between large geographical distance was found in wild emmer populations. it was suggested that the snps in the α-amylase inhibitor genes were subjected to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary role in gene differentiation at the gene loci.
