BACKGROUND
upon infection, viruses are rapidly recognized by the innate immune system through germ line-encoded pattern-recognition receptors   <cit> . several classes of prr, including toll-like receptors  and rig-i-like receptors , recognize viral components and directly activate immune cells. the rlrs are comprised of rig-i and mda- <dig>  that are cytosolic helicases sensing viral rna  <cit> . importantly, rig-i and mda- <dig> contain two cards   <cit> . the atpase activity of both helicases as a result of binding to their ligands is required for conformational changes that lead to the exposure of the cards otherwise masked by the c-terminal regulatory domain. this conformational change is required for a putative interaction with the card domain of the mitochondrial adaptor mavs   <cit> . mavs then activates two cytosolic protein kinase complexes, one consisting of the "noncanonical" ikk-related kinase tbk <dig>  or ikk-i/ε  associated with various adaptor proteins like tank , nap <dig>  and nemo , and the other comprising ikkα, ikkβ and nemo  <cit> . the tbk <dig> complex leads to phosphorylation and dimerization of the transcription factors irf <dig> and irf <dig>  which translocate to the nucleus and bind to ifn-stimulated response elements , thereby resulting in the expression of type i ifn genes and a set of ifn-inducible genes. the ikk complex activates nf-κb, subsequently promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> .

interestingly, it has been reported that mavs must be localized to mitochondria to exert its function  <cit> , suggesting that the mitochondrial environment is required for signal transduction following rlr activation. in agreement with this hypothesis, we recently reported that mitochondrial dynamics regulate mavs-mediated signaling  <cit> . nevertheless, the regulation of mavs in the rlr pathway remains unclear.

here, we report that rlr activation induces a selective proteasomal degradation of the larger mavs isoform, subsequent to its ubiquitination on lysine  <dig> and  <dig> by the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase trim <dig>  surprisingly, this mavs degradation seems to be required for the downstream signaling leading to type i ifn production, since its inhibition with a proteasome inhibitor prevents irf <dig> activation. importantly, we observed that prevention of the selective mavs degradation leads to a retention at the mitochondria of nemo and tbk <dig>  thus, our results suggest that mavs acts as a recruitment platform for the assembly and activation of a signaling complex, and that mavs degradation is likely required to release this signaling complex into the cytosol for irf <dig> phosphorylation and ensuing type i ifn production.

RESULTS
rlr activation promotes a selective degradation of the larger mavs isoform concomitantly with downstream signaling
to gain insight into the function and regulation of mavs following rlr activation, we investigated the kinetics of signaling downstream of rig-i by infecting hek293t or hela cells with the sendaï virus  h <dig> strain  <cit> , a strain composed mostly of small, copy-back defective interfering genomes and whose infection overproduces short uncapped 5'-triphosphate rnas that are specific ligands for rig-i  <cit> . accordingly, rig-i has been reported to be essential for the production of type i ifn in response to sev  <cit> . as a control, a wild-type  sev strain was used. immunoblot analyses at different time points following infection of cells with these sev strains confirmed that, unlike sev wt, sev h <dig> activates the rlr pathway as observed by the phosphorylation of both irf <dig> and the nf-κb inhibitor iκbα . rlr activation led to type i ifn production as assessed by the up-regulation of rig-i in sev h4-infected cells . next, in assays where a luciferase reporter was either under the control of the ifn-β promoter or driven by three copies of an nf-κb enhancer, sev h <dig> activated not only the ifn-β promoter but also nf-κb, in contrast to sev wt .

in different cell lines, including hek293t, hela , a <dig>  huh <dig> or jurkat cells , mavs is expressed as two major isoforms, as previously reported  <cit> , and sirnas raised against mavs knock down the expression of the different isoforms . interestingly, following sev h <dig> but not sev wt infection, the larger isoform was degraded, whereas the shorter isoform was not affected . intriguingly, degradation of the larger mavs isoform was concomitant with the phosphorylation of both irf <dig> and iκbα, suggesting that this degradation could be connected to downstream signaling. similar degradation was also observed in polyinosine-polycytidylic acid )-transfected hela cells   are sensed by mda- <dig>  <cit> ) or in vesicular stomatitis virus -infected cells . specific degradation of the larger mavs isoform was also remarked after lysis in a buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate   ruling out the hypothesis that the larger mavs isoform moves into an insoluble fraction following rlr activation.

to assess whether this specific mavs degradation is not a consequence of a feedback loop mediated by the production of type i ifn, cells were either treated with ifn-α <dig> or ifn-β, or treated after infection with a neutralizing antibody raised against ifnar <dig>  a chain of the ifn-α/β receptor. unlike rlr activation, we observed that stimulation of cells with ifn did not promote mavs degradation and inhibition of ifnar <dig> did not prevent the degradation as well  indicating that mavs degradation is not a consequence of the production of type i ifn.

mavs degradation upon rlr activation is independent of a specific protease
the finding that the larger mavs isoform is selectively degraded following rlr activation prompted us to investigate the mechanism of this degradation. first, by rt-pcr, we did not observe any differences in mavs mrnas in infected cells in comparison to non-infected cells  suggesting a post-translational regulation of mavs. it has been reported that mavs can be processed and inactivated by a specific cleavage triggered by the hepatitis c virus serine protease ns3-4a or by cellular caspases activated by various pro-apoptotic signals  <cit> . a degradation of the larger mavs isoform occurred following sev h <dig>  but not wt, infection , implying that mavs is not cleaved by a specific sev protease. in addition, mavs degradation occurred independently of caspases, since it was not prevented by the broad spectrum caspases inhibitor zvad-fmk . by contrast, mavs cleavage, as well as parp processing, were abrogated in cells undergoing apoptosis in the presence of the caspase inhibitor . the caspase inhibitors zvad-fmk and qvd-fmk had no effect on activation of ifnβ promoter or nf-κb as assessed in luciferase assays . likewise, treatment with leupeptin and pepstatin, which are inhibitors of trypsin-like/some serine proteases and acid proteases, respectively, did not hamper mavs degradation and downstream signaling .

rlr activation triggers mavs ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome
since protease inhibitors had no effect on mavs degradation, we hypothesized that mavs might be degraded by the proteasome. it is believed that polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine at position  <dig> of ubiquitin  target protein substrates for degradation by the proteasome, whereas polyubiquitin chains of alternative linkages  carry out signaling functions independent of proteolysis  <cit> . analysis of mavs in the mitochondrial fraction from sev h4-infected cells demonstrated that mavs is rapidly ubiquitinated during infection , as previously described  <cit> . importantly, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig> prevented degradation of the larger mavs isoform , signifying that following rlr activation, the larger mavs isoform is ubiquitinated then selectively degraded by the proteasome. surprisingly, the proteasome inhibition not only impaired mavs degradation following rlr activation but also prevented irf <dig> phosphorylation , its nuclear translocation  and ensuing type i ifn production, as assessed by the lack of rig-i expression  or by luciferase assays . interestingly, proteasome inhibition did not impair iκbα phosphorylation , indicating that prevention of mavs degradation has no impact on ikk activation. nevertheless, as expected, mg <dig> treatment inhibited nf-κb activation because iκbα is degraded by the proteasome once phosphorylated   <cit> . finally, the use of lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor, also prevented activation of the ifn-β promoter . together, our observations strongly suggest that the proteasome-mediated degradation of mavs is required for the signal transduction that leads to irf <dig> activation and ensuing type i ifn production.

the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase trim <dig> targets mavs for ubiquitination and degradation
to identify an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase involved in the selective degradation of mavs, cells were infected with sev h <dig> for four hours, and the purified mavs complex after immunoprecipitation was analyzed by mass spectrometry. four e <dig> ubiquitin ligases were identified by mass spectrometry, and among them trim <dig> drew our attention  because this e <dig> ubiquitin ligase was already known to be involved in the rlr pathway. indeed, trim <dig> induces the lys 63-linked ubiquitination of rig-i to stabilize the interaction with mavs  <cit>  but trim <dig> is also capable of promoting lys 48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of proteins  <cit> . interaction between mavs and trim <dig> was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous mavs, and the interaction was slightly enhanced after sev h <dig> infection . transfection of trim <dig> increased mavs ubiquitination  and promoted specifically a modest but significant degradation of the larger mavs isoform . in sharp contrast, two other mitochondrial proteins anchored into the outer membrane, namely mfn <dig> and bcl- <dig>  remained unaffected . importantly, trim <dig> catalyzed mavs ubiquitination with wt ubiquitin and ubiquitin-k <dig>  but not with ubiquitin-k <dig> . because only the larger mavs isoform is degraded following rlr activation, we hypothesized that the lysine residues that are targeted by trim <dig> to promote mavs ubiquitination are only present in the larger isoform. the shorter mavs isoform is a truncated form which lacks the n-terminus but retains the c-terminal transmembrane domain . sequence analysis revealed that two lysines  are present in the larger isoform only. we, therefore, mutated k <dig> and k <dig> and investigated whether the mutation affects trim25-mediated mavs ubiquitination. while a single mutation  partially reduces the ubiquitination profile of mavs , mavs ubiquitination was strongly inhibited when a double mutation was realized  . accordingly, mavs degradation was also prevented . because of k7's and k10's close proximity, we speculate that they likely compensate for each other. together, these data suggest that trim <dig> targets mavs at k <dig> and k <dig> for ubiquitination and degradation.

trim <dig> was described to act upstream of mavs through the ubiquitination of rig-i but not of mda- <dig>  <cit> . to circumvent this trouble, we transfected hmw poly into cells because this synthetic dsrna analog is sensed by mda- <dig> but not by rig-i  <cit>   and, thus, we noticed that transfection of trim <dig> augments activation of the ifnβ promoter once cells are stimulated . in trim <dig> sirna-transfected cells or in trim <dig> -/- mefs, we observed that ifnβ production was significantly impeded after activation with poly, indicating that trim <dig> also regulates the rlr pathway independently of rig-i . importantly, in trim <dig> -/- mefs, il- <dig> production was similar as in wt mefs following transfection with poly , suggesting that trim25-mediated degradative ubiquitination of mavs does not regulate nf-κb-induced cytokine production but only type i ifn synthesis . confirming this, immunoblot analyses showed that the knock down of trim <dig> inhibits the degradation of the larger mavs isoform as well as the ensuing phosphorylation of irf <dig>  but not of iκbα after activation . furthermore, mavs ubiquitination was strongly inhibited in trim <dig> -/- mefs in comparison to wt mefs after transfection with poly . collectively, our data demonstrate that trim <dig> binds to mavs and promotes its k48-linked ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation to allow irf <dig> but not nf-κb activation once rlrs are stimulated. interestingly, the knock down of trim <dig> led to the appearance of a protein band above the larger mavs isoform after stimulation in human cells , and our results indicate that it corresponds to a phosphorylated state . appearance of this form of mavs was a consequence of rlr activation  and treatment with λ phosphatase promoted its disappearance , confirming a phosphorylation of the larger mavs isoform once stimulated by rlrs. therefore, this observation suggests that to be degraded, the higher mavs isoform is not only ubiquitinated but is also phosphorylated, likely explaining why the overexpression of trim <dig> only promotes limited degradation of endogenous mavs .

irf <dig> phosphorylation depends on a translocation of a signaling complex from mitochondria to cytosol upon proteasomal degradation of mavs
since our data indicate that following rlr activation the proteasome-mediated degradation of mavs is required for irf <dig> activation, we explored how this degradation is involved. several proteins, such as traf <dig>  nemo and tbk <dig>  have been reported to be critical effectors downstream of mavs to trigger irf <dig> phosphorylation and type i ifn production  <cit> . so we decided to investigate whether the prevention of mavs degradation perturbs their localization within cells. hence, cells were infected with sev h <dig> in the presence or the absence of a proteasome inhibitor, and at different time points the presence of traf <dig>  nemo and tbk <dig> was studied in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. traf <dig>  nemo and tbk <dig> are cytosolic proteins, and their respective amounts remained unaffected by the infection in the presence or the absence of mg <dig> . like irf <dig>  tbk <dig> and nemo were not found associated with purified mitochondria during infection, but interestingly, when mavs degradation was inhibited, some tbk <dig> and nemo were detected in the mitochondrial fraction . since both proteins are cytosolic, prevention of mavs degradation likely promotes their retention into the mitochondrial fraction. this was confirmed by immunofluorescence studies. indeed, in control or sev h4-infected cells, tbk <dig> was diffusely localized in the cytosol, but when cells were pre-treated with mg <dig>  a significant redistribution of tbk <dig> to mitochondria was observed in infected cells . this relocation was dependent of mavs, since mavs knock down  abrogated the association of tbk <dig> with mitochondria after infection  and after cell fractionation, retention of both tbk <dig> and nemo in the mitochondrial fraction was not observed . a defect in the degradation of the larger mavs isoform leads to a retention of both tbk <dig> and nemo within the mitochondrial fraction and is subsequently linked to an inhibition of irf <dig> phosphorylation . we, therefore, propose that following rlr activation, mavs allows the formation of a signaling complex composed at least of nemo and tbk <dig>  but this complex must be released into the cytosol consequently to mavs degradation for tbk <dig> to phosphorylate irf <dig> . interaction between mavs and the signaling complex is likely indirect because, as previously reported  <cit> , we did not detect any association between mavs and tbk <dig> or nemo in co-immunoprecipitation experiments . the signaling complex may also contain the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase traf <dig> because proteasome inhibition slightly increased the proportion of traf <dig> associated with purified mitochondria once rlrs are activated . moreover, while prevention of mavs degradation impaired irf <dig> phosphorylation following rlr activation , it did not preclude iκbα phosphorylation  suggesting again that mavs degradation is not required for nf-κb signaling.

discussion
previous studies have shown that the mitochondrial adaptor protein mavs is essential to the rlr antiviral innate immune response  <cit> . nevertheless, the function of mavs, as well as its regulation in the rlr signaling pathway, has remained unclear. very recently, it has been described that mavs forms functional prion-like aggregates after viral infection and that these aggregates are required for the activation of irf <dig> in the cytoplasm  <cit> .

mavs is expressed as two major isoforms, and here we demonstrate that rlr activation induces the specific proteasome-mediated degradation of the larger mavs isoform after its polyubiquination, but, importantly, this degradation seems to be required for the downstream signaling that leads to type i ifn but not pro-inflammatory cytokines production. we identified the ring-finger e <dig> ubiquitin ligase trim <dig> as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes lys 48-linked ubiquitination of mavs, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. trim <dig> has already been shown to play a critical role in the rlr pathway because it promotes lys 63-linked ubiquitination of the card domain of rig-i, but not of the related helicase mda- <dig>  to enhance and stabilize the interaction with the card domain of mavs  <cit> . nevertheless, it was reported that trim <dig>  targets the proteasome-mediated degradation of 14-3- <dig> σ and klf <dig>  <cit>  confirming that trim <dig> is capable of triggering lys 48-linked ubiquitination as well. hence, trim <dig> appears as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase with a crucial dual role in the positive regulation of the rlr pathway through its function on rig-i to favor the rig-i/mavs interaction as well as on mavs to promote its proteasome-mediated degradation, which is likely required for irf <dig> but not nf-κb activation. how mavs is extracted from the mitochondrial outer membrane before proteasome degradation is currently unknown but it may involve the aaa atpase cdc48/p97/vcp, thought to extract integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and chaperone them to the proteasome, as it is the case for mcl- <dig> and mitofusins  <cit> .

when trim <dig> was knocked down, degradation of the larger mavs isoform that is observed following rlr activation was prevented, but, surprisingly, an accumulation of a phosphorylated even larger isoform of mavs was detected as well. so it seems that to promote its degradation by the proteasome, mavs must undergo a phosphorylation in addition to an ubiquitination, as is the case for the nf-κb inhibitor iκbα  <cit> . the nature and function of this phosphorylation, as well as the kinase involved in this process, deserve further investigations.

once the specific degradation of the larger mavs isoform was prevented with a proteasome inhibitor, a retention of nemo and tbk <dig>  two essential mediators in type i ifn production, was observed in the mitochondrial fraction. while this mitochondrial retention of both proteins requires the presence of mavs, we did not detect any direct interactions between mavs and either nemo or tbk <dig> , indicating an indirect association probably through ubiquitin chains. indeed, a study has unveiled a key role of ubiquitin chains in irf <dig> activation downstream of mavs with nemo functioning as a sensor of lys  <dig> polyubiquitin chains to activate tbk <dig>  <cit> . in this model, an important question that remains to be resolved is the identity of the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that synthetizes the lys  <dig> ubiquitin chains to mediate irf <dig> activation by mavs. a candidate is traf <dig>  because this e <dig> ubiquitin ligase has been shown to be important for type i ifn production by rlrs  <cit> , but in our hands the knock down of traf <dig> did not impair the activation of the ifnβ promoter , suggesting that other e <dig> ubiquitin ligases can compensate the loss of traf <dig>  as previously proposed  <cit> . nevertheless, we found that a small fraction of traf <dig> is associated with mitochondria and this fraction was slightly increased when mavs degradation was inhibited, indicating that traf <dig> may be a component of the signaling complex downstream of mavs and composed of at least nemo and tbk <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
at the mitochondrial surface, mavs likely serves as a recruitment platform for the assembly and activation of a signaling complex involving nemo and tbk <dig> and required for irf <dig> activation. our observation that irf <dig> was not phosphorylated and activated by tbk <dig> unless the nemo/tbk <dig> complex translocates from the mitochondria into the cytosol after the proteasomal degradation of mavs suggests that the cytoplasmic translocation of the mavs-assembled signaling complex is required for an optimal irf <dig> activation .
