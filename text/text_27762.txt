BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  wallace et al.  <cit>  characterized a high-density lipoprotein from decapod crustaceans ovaries with similar biochemical properties to lipoproteins isolated from vertebrate eggs, and proposed the generic term "lipovitellin" for this abundant lipoprotein. two years later, kerr  <cit>  identified a blood-borne protein present only in female blue crabs callinectes sapidus with developing oocytes. this lipoprotein turned out to be serologically identical to oocyte lipovitellin. the term "vitellogenin"  was proposed over thirty-five years ago  <cit>  to describe female-specific insect hemolymph protein precursors of egg yolk, regardless of their amino acid sequences or structures. this term, based on a functional criterion, was later adopted in other egg-laying animals, including crustaceans  <cit> , and is widely used in the scientific community and sequence databases. molecular characterization of vtg in numerous oviparous species has revealed that this high molecular weight glycolipoprotein is conserved among species, suggesting derivation from a common ancestor  <cit> . however, molecular data obtained in some species has revealed that the main egg yolk precursor proteins are unrelated to the vtg protein family. for example, major egg yolk precursor protein is related to transferrin in sea urchins  <cit>  and lipase in higher diptera  <cit> . multiple alignments of vertebrate and non-vertebrate vtg sequences revealed five relatively well-conserved regions  <cit> . regions i to iii, located in the n-terminal part, correspond to the lipovitellin  <dig> subunit of vertebrate vtg, while regions iv and v, located in the c-terminal part, correspond to the lipovitellin  <dig> subunit. sequence and deduced structural homologies indicated an evolutionary relationship of vtg with three mammalian proteins, apolipoprotein b <dig> , the large subunit of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein , and the von willebrand factor  <cit> . the identification of conserved amino acid sequence motifs and ancestral exon boundaries in apob, mtp, non-vertebrate and vertebrate vtg, and insect apolipophorin ii/i  indicated that large lipid transfer proteins  are members of the same multigene superfamily and have emerged from a common ancestral molecule designed to play a pivotal role in the intracellular and extracellular transfer of lipids and liposoluble substances  <cit> .

knowledge of molecular structure and expression of vtg in oviparous animals has increased impressively over the past two decades  <cit> . recent molecular characterization and expression studies of the main egg yolk precursor protein, referred to as vtg, in over ten decapod crustacean species suggests that this precursor protein is atypical in regard to vtg from other oviparous animals  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that the crustacean clotting protein , a very high density lipoprotein  responsible for hemolymph clot formation, is also a vtg-related protein  <cit> . the aim of this study was therefore to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of these crustacean vtg-related proteins with other lltp superfamily members. the results presented here led us to call apolipocrustacein  rather than vtg the major decapod crustacean egg yolk precursor protein.

RESULTS
crustacean apocr sequences
full-length apocr cdna sequences, annotated as vtg in the genbank™/ebi data bank , are currently available for eleven decapod species: penaeus semisulcatus, penaeus monodon, metapenaeus ensis, marsupenaeus japonicus, litopenaeus vannamei, feneropenaeus merguiensis, cherax quadricarinatus, machrobrachium rosenbergii, charybdis feriatus, pandalus hypsinotus. and portunus trituberculatus. in penaeus semisulcatus and marsupenaeus japonicus, the same apocr cdna was isolated from ovary and hepatopancreas tissues  <cit> . in metapenaeus ensis, two apocr cdnas, apocr <dig> and apocr <dig>  were isolated from these two tissues  <cit> . they shared 56% sequence identity and showed a tissue-specific expression pattern. these two apocr may result from a gene duplication event in the metapenaeus lineage. a recent phylogeny of penaeid shrimps, performed on two mitochondrial genes, indicated that metapenaeus may be representative of the ancient penaeus genus but distant from the other penaeid species  <cit> . alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of penaeus semisulcatus revealed a sequence identity ranging from 92% with feneropenaeus merguiensis to 34% with charybdis feriatus . the phylogenetic analysis resulting from this alignment  indicated that these deduced precursor proteins may be confidently grouped according to the species tree; i.e. the penaeid shrimps of dendrobranchiata suborder were grouped together and the pleocyemata suborder species, crab , crayfish  and prawn  were outside this monophyletic group. it is interesting to note that phylogenetic results correlated with the expression pattern of apocr transcripts. dendrobranchiata suborder species express apocr transcripts in both ovaries and hepatopancreas  <cit> , while the expression of paralogous apocr <dig> from metapenaeus ensis  <cit>  and apocr of pleocyemata suborder species is apparently restricted to the hepatopancreas  <cit> .

global sequence alignment of crustacean apocr with other lltp
a blastp  <cit>  search of the nonredundant genbank™ database using penaeus semisulcatus apocr as a target sequence revealed high blast scores and expected  values with other decapod apocr, from the full-length sequence of feneropenaeus merguiensis  to charybdis feriatus . there were also similarities with other extracellular lltp: insect apolp-ii/i, from locusta migratoria  to anopheles gambiae , and vertebrate apob, from gallus gallus  to danio rerio , including homo sapiens apob- <dig> precursor protein . lower scores and e values were retrieved with vtg of oviparous animals, ranging from crassostrea gigas mollusks  to samia cynthia ricini insects . blast scores and e values of intracellular mtp family members overlapped with vtg family members, as shown with strongylocentrotus purpuratus echinoderms  or homo sapiens . even if blast analysis represents an over simplification of reality, the results obtained by this method, i.e. so-called crustacean vtg are more closely-related to insect apolp-ii/i than to insect vtg, as indicated by blast scores, was not seriously taken into account, as the term vtg was already used for these sequences.

crustacean apocr  is of intermediate length between insect, nematode, mollusk, and vertebrate vtg, which are generally shorter , and insect apolp-ii/i, which are larger . consistent with blast scores, crustacean apocrs confidently align with insect apolp-ii/is . apolp-ii/i is the high molecular weight apolipophorin of lipophorin found at high concentrations in insect hemolymph  <cit> . the best local alignments between these sequences occurred along the first  <dig>  amino acid residues and in their c-terminal parts .

domain architecture, conserved sequence motifs, and consensus cleavage site of crustacean apocr
a cd-search  <cit>  revealed that the amino acid sequence of penaeus semisulcatus and other crustacean apocr include three conserved structural domains . a lipoprotein n-terminal domain , also known as vitellogenin_n  and enclosed in the large lipid transfer  module  <cit>  was identified in the n-terminal part of apocr. a duf <dig> domain  of unknown function was identified in the central region, and a von willebrand-factor type-d domain   at the c-terminal end. while the vwd domain, initially identified in the human von willebrand factor , is distributed over a wide range of proteins, the llt module/lpd-n domain, part of the lipovitellin  <dig> subunit of vertebrate vtg  <cit> , contains twenty-two n-terminal conserved amino acid sequence motifs  as a common denominator of lltp  <cit> . the alignment of these conserved sequence motifs, including those retrieved from apocr is published as supporting information . similarly to apolp-ii/i, crustacean apocr lacks polyserine tracks that correspond to the phosvitin domain in the vtg of vertebrates and some non-vertebrate species.

in insects, the apolp-ii/i is cleaved before its secretion into apolp-ii and apolp-i  at a consensus cleavage site, rxr, for dibasic endoprotease processing  <cit> , and this cleavage is mediated by furin  <cit> . likewise, crustacean apocr is also cleaved at a similar dibasic site for subtilisin-like endoprotease processing  <cit> . this consensus site occurs at amino acid position 725/ <dig> in penaeus semisulcatus , between conserved motifs n <dig> and n <dig>  and aligns very well between crustacean apocrs and insect apolp-ii/is . the n-terminal apocr ~74-kda subunit in penaeus semisulcatus  <cit>  and other decapod species, apocr-ii, displays high amino acid sequence similarities with the ~80-kda apolp-ii  <cit> . for example, the penaeus semisulcatus 74-kda apocr-ii subunit displays 22%–43% identity-similarity with locusta migratoria apolp-ii, while locusta migratoria apolp-ii displays no more than 33%–55% and 28%–47% identity-similarity with manduca sexta and drosophila melanogaster apolp-ii, respectively. a similar consensus cleavage site is present in most insect vtgs, but at a different location, in the extended region between motifs n <dig> and n <dig>  <cit> . however, a potential subtilisin-like convertase site is present between motifs n <dig> and n <dig> of nematode and crassostrea gigas vtgs.

phylogenetic analysis and correlation with lltp domain architecture and protein function
the evolutionary relationship of genes in the lltp superfamily was evaluated after aligning the twenty-two conserved n-terminal sequence motifs of the llt module of selected lltp sequences  and the phylogenetic analyses were conducted by using the neighbor-joining  and the maximum likelihood   or the bayesian inference   methods. the phylogenetic tree separated extracellular  from intracellular  lltp sequences with confidence into separate clusters, suggesting that these extracellular proteins arose from a common ancestor . significant internal branches defined two sequence groups. the first group, named the apo family, suggested that apocr, apolp-ii/i, and apob formed a monophyletic branch , with two subclusters defined by highly significant internal branches, corresponding to crustacean decapod apocr and insect apolp-ii/i subfamilies  on one side and to vertebrate apob subfamily  on the other side. internal sub-branching of the apocr/apolp-ii/i subcluster was consistent with the species tree, i.e. crustacean and insect sequences were separated in two groups, each one with high support values . duplicated metapenaeus ensis apocr sequences were clustered together and therefore both belonged to the apocr subfamily. the second group of sequences named the vtg/cp family supported by a bi posterior probability of  <dig>  grouped with confidence in separate clusters: vertebrate, mollusk, nematode, and insect vtg, and crustacean cp .

with regard to other crustacean sequences, one point must be highlighted. vtg from daphnia magna, a species belonging to the class of branchiopoda, and cp from decapod crustaceans, belonging to the class of malacostraca, tend to be grouped with insect vtg . it should be noted that daphnia magna vtg is fused with a superoxide dismutase module at the n-terminal end  <cit> . therefore, these crustacean proteins are more closely related to arthropoda vtg than decapod apocr. vtg, cp, apocr, and apolp-ii/i members contain a vwd domain at their c-terminal end  that may be implicated in the clotting cascade and multimerization, as demonstrated with human vwf  <cit> . the functional significance of the vwd domain in vtg requires additional elucidation. recent data demonstrated that teleost fish vtg exhibits an agglutinin activity and may be involved in defense reactions  <cit> , and also that insect apolp-ii/i is involved in the immune response  <cit> , suggesting a new meaning for the conservation of this domain during evolution. the fact that the phylogenies presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> were performed using sequences of the llt module/lpd-n domain reinforces the hypothetical dual-functional nature of crustacean cp. this constitutes the only protein fraction of crustacean vhdl, and its involvement in lipid transport was suggested in earlier studies  <cit> . it should be noted that, in crustaceans, the most prominent lipoprotein in the hemolymph, lp <dig> or bgbp, is not a member of the lltp superfamily but is also associated with defense reactions  <cit> , supporting a link between lipid transport and immune systems in these animals.

it has been demonstrated that the lpd-n domain found in lltp forms a "lipid pocket", enabling lipid loading of vtg  <cit> . by comparative analysis, it was suggested that, in apob, this domain may similarly form a lipovitellin-like "proteolipid" intermediate containing a lipid pocket that requires mtp for assembly  <cit> . the presence of apocr and cp, the latter structurally related to vtg, in the same shrimp species , and of both apolp-ii/i and vtg in honey bees , from separate clusters according to our phylogenetic analysis , strongly suggest that these sequences diverged after an ancient duplication event leading to the separation of an apo paralogous group from vtg/cp sequences. through their llt module/lpd-n domain, these homologous sequences retained the capacity to bind and transport lipids, a function shared with mtp family members that is probably the ancestral function of lltp  <cit> . the use of truncated forms of apob in cell cultures showed that the percentage of lipid associated with apob- <dig> truncated near the c-terminal end of the lpd-n domain, approached zero. furthermore, there appeared to be a threshold in apob size, between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids from the n-terminal end, below which the polypeptide may not form a lipoprotein particle . however, apob needs to reach a minimum critical length of  <dig> amino acids for lipoprotein assembly, an mtp-dependent process relying on a portion of apob located between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, apocr, apolp-ii/i and apob sequences were found to have a common duf <dig> domain, of unknown function . protein database screening revealed that this domain was specifically associated with apo sequences , and spanned amino acids 957– <dig> of human apob. drosophila mtp promotes the assembly and secretion of human apob- <dig>  <cit> , and human mtp enhances the secretion of xenopus laevis vtg  <cit> , which lacks the duf <dig> domain. a mutant form of human mtp was still able to promote xenopus vtg synthesis, whereas secretion of human apob was abolished, suggesting that requirement of apob for interacting with mtp is more stringent than that of vtg. this may be related to the presence of the duf <dig> domain in apob. this domain may be acquired in the apo ancestor through domain accretion and neofunctionalization potentially resulting in better biogenesis of neutral lipid-rich lipoproteins.

gene duplication facilitates functional divergence but functional constraints enable the retention of genes with overlapping or redundant functions. in addition to their role in plasma and hemolymph lipid transport between somatic tissues, extracellular lltp, mainly vtg and apocr, facilitate the massive deposition of yolk reserves inside the oocytes of most oviparous species. apob, apolp-ii/i, and possibly apocr containing lipoproteins are involved in neutral lipid deposition in the oocyte after receptor-mediated endocytosis on the same or similar oocyte-specific receptor used by vtg, which belongs to the ldl receptor superfamily  <cit> . ovarian lipolysis of these circulating lipoproteins may also be a main source of lipids for the growing oocyte . the low lipid load of crustacean cp and its abundance in shrimp hemolymph cannot fully account for the amount of lipid accumulated within the oocytes  <cit>  and may explain a major role of apocr in this process in conjunction with the bgbp/lp <dig> 

relations among the arthropoda subphyla and the major groups of crustaceans are still a matter for debate. crustacea exhibit extensive variability in body plans, compared to other arthropod groups and monophyly of crustaceans and relationships among the constituent lineages are controversial  <cit> . while mitochondrial genomes suggest that hexapods and crustaceans are mutually paraphyletic  <cit> , molecular analyses on rrna and protein-coding nuclear gene sequences indicate that crustaceans and hexapods form a clade  and that the sister group of hexapoda is branchiopoda , rather than malacostraca   <cit> , thereby making hexapods terrestrial crustaceans and the traditionally defined crustacea, paraphyletic. additional branchiopoda and non decapoda apocr and vtg/cp sequences, together with their role as a main egg yolk precursor protein, may help to clarify the pancrustacea-major splits, e.g. provide support for the branchiopods being closest to hexapods and reject the alternative, e.g. malacostracan-hexapod association. additional data will also clarify the relationships among the many malacostracan subgroups  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
observation of modular architecture and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the main egg yolk precursor protein of decapod crustaceans is a member of the lltp superfamily, is homologous to insect apolp-ii/i and vertebrate apob, and would be more appropriately called apolipocrustacein  rather than vtg. the presence of apocr and a clotting protein structurally related to vtg from the same shrimp species  and both apolp-ii/i and vtg from insect species , suggest that, in addition to their involvement in the lipid metabolism, extracellular lltp may have acquired other functions during metazoan evolution, e.g. involvement in clotting cascade and immune response. the findings of this study may be also a starting point for using lltp phylogeny and their functional role to clarify the controversial relationships among pancrustacean constituent lineages.
