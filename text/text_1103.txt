BACKGROUND
dogs consist of over  <dig> genetically isolated breeds with considerable morphological and behavioural diversity. dog breeds have undergone two major bottlenecks, the first when they were domesticated from the wolf ~ <dig>  years ago  <cit> , and the second in the last few hundred years during development of the modern breeds from a low number of individuals selected for certain physical or behavioural traits  <cit> . such heavy artificial selection results in limited genetic variation within each breed and many inherited diseases. inherited diseases in dogs are predominantly recessive, often resulting from strong inbreeding and usually showing allelic homogeneity within a breed or group of related breeds and allelic heterogeneity between less related breeds  <cit> .

an autosomal recessive neutropenia, known as trapped neutrophil syndrome , has been identified in the border collie breed. the disease was originally described in the australian and new zealand population of border collies and is characterised by a deficiency of segmented neutrophils in the blood and hyperplasia of myeloid cells in the bone marrow  <cit> . severely affected pups show abnormal craniofacial development with a narrowed elongated skull shape described by breeders as ferret-like. affected pups are often smaller than their litter mates and suffer from chronic infections and failure to thrive resulting from a compromised immune system. some show early infections from six weeks of age. for others the first sign of tns is a bad reaction to immunisation at  <dig> weeks, while in a few cases clinical signs are very mild and not recognised until two or more years of age  <cit> .

all known tns affected dogs at the start of this research could be traced back to a single common ancestor  <cit> . this suggested that the disease was the result of a single mutational event that had been spread through the population by the champion sire effect. champion male show dogs are often used heavily for breeding to pass on show winning traits. any detrimental mutations that a champion male may be carrying can rapidly spread through a population. when coupled with inbreeding, recessive diseases can manifest within a few generations after the champion is used. all affected dogs are then homozygous and identical-by-descent for the genomic region surrounding the mutation. we considered allelic heterogeneity unlikely for tns given the recent common ancestor.

a promising approach to identify disease genes is the candidate gene approach coupled with linkage analysis using microsatellites from the candidate gene region. this approach can confirm whether the region is the correct one even if the mutation is non-coding. we chose candidate genes in this study based on their role in pathways known to be associated with neutrophil maturation or known to cause neutropenia in humans.

we investigated  <dig> genes as candidates for tns, four of these are known to cause a disease featuring neutropenia and six are linked to neutrophil function. we have previously excluded six of the genes from this list: chemokine  receptor  <dig> ,  <cit> ; neutrophil elastase ; adaptor-related protein complex  <dig>  beta  <dig> subunit ; and adaptor-related protein complex subunits ap3d <dig>  ap3s <dig> and ap3m <dig>  <cit> .

one of the other four candidates  was the ligand of cxcr <dig>  chemokine  ligand  <dig> , which may result in a similar phenotype to disruption of cxcr <dig>  another candidate was the anti-apoptotic factor, bcl2-like  <dig> , which has been shown to be down-regulated in cases of neutropenia  <cit> . we also investigated interleukin  <dig> receptor b  as it is able to attract and activate neutrophils to sites of inflammation from the blood  <cit> . we considered cohen syndrome   <cit>  as a model for tns because of presence of the clinical signs of neutropenia with hyperplasia of the bone marrow enriched for the myeloid cell lines  <cit>  and a typical craniofacial dysmorphism. cohen syndrome is caused by mutations in vesicle protein sorting 13b . we used linkage analysis followed by sequencing to investigate whether a mutation in one of these genes is responsible for tns in border collies.

RESULTS
we examined the four candidate genes  for linkage to tns using between one and five microsatellites for each candidate. we eliminated three from being linked to tns based on maximum logarithm of odds  scores less than minus-two from multipoint linkage analysis in an eight generation pedigree with seven to  <dig> affecteds depending on the analysis . we developed genotyping assays for four microsatellites from the vps13b region and named them c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig>  and c <dig>  based on chromosome number and location in 10's of kb . these microsatellites were highly polymorphic with between eight and  <dig> alleles in a sample of  <dig> border collies . we observed  <dig> haplotypes involving alleles at these loci and a large amount of linkage disequilibrium between alleles . multipoint linkage analysis for our tns pedigree, with multiple inbreeding loops  <cit> , gave significant evidence of linkage with a maximum lod score of  <dig>  at marker c <dig>  .

we observed strong linkage disequilibrium between tns and the microsatellites at vps13b, with the majority of affected dogs homozygous for a single haplotype . variations in the disease haplotype occurred in three dogs, each at  <dig> locus only and likely represent new mutations in the microsatellite rather than recombinants.

we sequenced each of the  <dig> exons with at least  <dig> bp of flanking intron in two controls, two obligate carriers and two affecteds. we found  <dig> coding sites that were either polymorphic in these dogs or different to the reference genome . we identified a homozygous four bp deletion in affected dogs, relative to both border collie controls and the dog reference genome. the sequence of the affected allele is a deletion from bases  <dig> to  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> , which is listed as being within exon  <dig> of vps13b . obligate carriers  were heterozygous for the four bp deletion . the deletion results in frame shift of putative transcript variants  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and premature truncation after the 980th amino acid of the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acid vps13b protein isoforms, respectively .

we sequenced exon  <dig> in  <dig> border collies , and all affecteds were homozygotes for the gttt deletion and all obligate carriers were heterozygotes . the deletion co-segregated with the tns phenotype in all cases. of the  <dig> border collies related to the tns pedigree with unknown status,  <dig> were heterozygous and  <dig> were homozygous for the normal sequence. we designed a pcr assay to detect the deletion based on the size of the pcr product.

we applied the tns carrier test to a sample set of  <dig> australian border collies collected before the tns research began. these samples can be considered randomly sampled with respect to tns. we also tested a set of  <dig> samples that were collected in norway to represent the local border collie population . the sample sets gave allele proportions of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for the tns mutation. we have tested  <dig> border collies from europe, usa, uk, australia, new zealand and japan,  <dig> were carriers and  <dig> were affected. this sample set of  <dig> has a strong ascertainment bias towards dogs with familial links to known carriers. to correct for this ascertainment bias, we removed any samples where either of the parents had been tested as carriers, leaving  <dig> dogs. allele frequencies ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  per country with an average of  <dig>  from the sample set of  <dig> dogs .

a comparison between descriptions of cohen syndrome patients in the literature and seven tns affected border collies identified an overlap in disease characteristics . features common to both cohen syndrome and tns include: typical facies; slender extremities; infantile hypotonia; developmental delay; and neutropenia. however, obesity and ophthalmic abnormalities, which are other common cohen syndrome clinical signs, were not found in border collies either because they are not present or could not be examined . mental retardation is a clinical sign in cohen syndrome that is difficult to assess in dogs, but inability to learn simple commands was reported by the breeder for three of the seven affecteds dogs while some dogs were reported to be quick learners.

to determine whether the mutation is causative rather than linked to a non-coding vps13b mutation or mutation in another gene in the region we compared sequence data from other species. high conservation of vps13b is observed at both the amino acid and dna level across mammalian species, for example human - dog homologies  <dig> % for amino acids,  <dig> % for mrna; human - mouse  <dig> % for amino acids,  <dig> % mrna; dog - mouse  <dig> % for amino acids,  <dig> % mrna. a multiple species comparison using phastcons from the ucsc genome browser shows the most highly conserved regions to be exons and transcription factor binding sites, which suggests conservation in the regulation of vps13b.

there is a large vps13b transcript variant in human that is not detected in mouse. the two largest putative transcripts of vps13b in the dog are variant  <dig>  and variant  <dig>  which utilise an alternative exon  <dig>  referred to as exon 27b. to investigate the presence of these transcript variants in dog brain tissue, we amplified cortex and cerebellum cdna from three healthy dogs by pcr using primers spanning the alternate exon region . we found products of  <dig> bp corresponding to transcript variant  <dig> and  <dig> bp corresponding to transcript variant  <dig> to be present in both tissue types . the pcr fragment for transcript variant  <dig> showed higher intensity on the gel suggesting higher expression levels. a product of approximately  <dig> bp was also present on the gel at a lower concentration in cerebellum and was barely detectable in cortex. we sequenced the pcr product mixture and found sequence homozygosity up to the expected alternate exon site followed by mixed sequence. the mixed sequence could be resolved to the expected component sequences of the two transcripts confirming that the bands on the gel were the expected pcr products from the transcript variants. sequence from the  <dig> bp product was not detectable in the sequence results from cortex or cerebellum, clear pcr termination sites were identified at  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp from the primer binding site.

we used comparative genomics to identify other species capable of this alternative splicing by aligning reference genome sequences from ncbi and canine exons  <dig> and 27b. we observed that human, cow, horse, mouse and rat all have an exon that is  <dig> bp in length and highly similar sequence to exon 27b in dogs . human, horse and cow, but not mouse or rat, have an exon  <dig> bp in length that is highly similar in sequence to exon  <dig> in dogs. for this exon, the mouse reference genome  had 80% identity with a seven bp deletion compared to dog. the rat  showed 80% identity for the first  <dig> bp of the sequence , but a  <dig> bp deletion, relative to the mouse, disrupts the sequence .

discussion
the high frequency of the tns deletion in the border collie population suggests that the mutation is much older than the recent common ancestor of our affected cases  <cit> . the mutation is present in border collies in all countries tested and in both the working dog and show dog subgroups, which have been genetically isolated for around  <dig> years. the widespread nature of the disease indicates that the mutation was either already present in the founder dogs used to establish the breed or originated very early in the breed. if the mutation predates development of the breed it may exist in other collie breeds, as does collie eye anomaly  <cit> . the sample sets collected from norway and australia prior to tns research represent an unbiased sample set giving the most reliable disease allele proportion of 7-8%. the allele proportions from other countries after correction for ascertainment bias support the values obtained from these two sample sets.

we have shown that tns in border collies is caused by a mutation in the same gene that causes cohen syndrome in humans, vps13b. over  <dig> mutations in human vps13b have been identified, all resulting in the characteristic cohen phenotype. the highly conserved nature of vps13b suggests that the mutation identified in the canine form of the gene would cause similar clinical signs to that observed in human. the strong similarity in clinical signs between cohen syndrome and tns is supporting evidence that vps13b is the tns gene. we have found no reports of mutations in this gene in other organisms which makes tns in the dog the first model for cohen syndrome.

cohen syndrome is rare  with a homogenous phenotype reported in finnish patients, who carry mainly the c.3348_3349delct mutation, and large variation in clinical signs in non-finnish patients who carry many different mutations  <cit> . diagnosis of cohen syndrome is based on the presence of at least six of the following main clinical signs: developmental delay; microcephaly; typical cohen syndrome facial gestalt; truncal obesity with slender extremities; overly sociable behaviour; joint hypermobility; high myopia and/or retinal dystrophy; and neutropenia  <cit> . border collies show developmental delay; microcephaly; typical facial gestalt; slender extremities; and neutropenia, which was enough overlap for us to suspect tns was homologous to cohen syndrome.

the cohen syndrome gene, vps13b, is a potential transmembrane protein involved in vesicle-mediated transport and sorting within the cell  <cit> . the gene is similar to yeast vps <dig> and is most highly conserved at the ends of the protein which are similar to vacuolar protein sorting domains  <cit> . vps <dig> has undergone duplication events early in vertebrate evolution resulting in four paralogous copies vps13a, b, c and d, which have diverged in function. the transcripts of each of the four genes typically vary by a few amino acids in the middle of the sequence and exhibit tissue specific expression. each has one ubiquitous transcript and one transcript expressed in brain  <cit> . human vps13b has four transcript variants, two large transcripts utilising  <dig> exons each and two small transcripts utilising eight and  <dig> exons.

the canine form of vps13b is located at approximately  <dig>  mb on canine chromosome  <dig>  and contains  <dig> exons with five putative transcript variants . seifert et al.  <cit>  found that the full length transcript variants showed the highest expression with smaller transcripts barely detectable in both humans and mice. this finding suggests that the smaller transcripts are either from imperfect splicing or play a regulatory role in vps13b expression. it is also likely that the smaller of the five putative transcripts listed for canine vps13b have similar expression and functions. the two largest transcripts of vps13b in humans utilise alternate splicing to include either exon  <dig>  or 28b  which are homologous to dog exons  <dig> and 27b, respectively. in humans, transcript nm_ <dig> is ubiquitous and transcript nm_ <dig> is expressed at roughly 20% of the concentration compared to kidney, placenta, small intestine, and lung, while in the brain and retina both transcripts have roughly equal expression  <cit> .

seifert et al.  <cit>  have shown that mice lack a transcript homologous to human nm_ <dig>  and only the ubiquitous transcript is detectable. we have shown that dogs express both transcripts in the brain incorporating exons  <dig> or 27b. we also detected a weak product at around  <dig> bp which may correspond to the incorporation of both exons  <dig> and 27b. the product was too weak to be detected in mixed sequence in either cerebellum or cortex. an mrna incorporating both exons would change the reading frame and considering the low levels of expression is likely to be a splicing artefact.

we used comparative genomics to show that cow and horse are also likely to express both transcripts. the mouse and rat were found to have independent deletions disrupting use of the exon homologous to canine exon  <dig>  in the case of the mouse, utilising this exon would change the reading frame and destroy protein function. the deletion in the rat removes the 3' half of the exon destroying the splice signal. this shows that the alternate transcript is not required in either mouse or rat.

mental retardation observed in cohen syndrome suggests that vps13b plays a role in brain development or maintaining brain function in humans. seifert et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that disruption to the transcript utilising exon  <dig> may be responsible for the mental retardation observed in cohen syndrome. the lack of mutations discovered in humans that involve sequence from either exon  <dig> or 28b make it difficult to test this hypothesis. dogs express both transcript variants in the brain and an equivalent of mental retardation is observed in some tns affected dogs. this identifies dogs as a good model to test the hypothesis that the human transcript utilising exon  <dig> may be responsible for mental retardation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that tns in border collies is the result of a mutation in vps13b and that dogs, like humans, express alternately spliced transcripts of vps13b in the brain. we have used comparative genomics to show that other mammalian species are likely to express alternately spliced transcripts in the brain, similar to human and dog. dogs affected with tns are the first animal model for cohen syndrome and can be used to study the development of the disease and the effect at the cellular level of varying expression of vps13b.
