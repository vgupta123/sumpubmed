BACKGROUND
the type iii secretion system  is a complex molecular machine found in numerous gram-negative bacterial pathogens of animals and plants  <cit> . this secretion system encodes a syringe-like organelle that injects effector proteins directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. the effectors ultimately affect host cell physiology.

s. enterica serovar typhimurium  possesses two virulence associated ttsss encoded by the salmonella pathogenicity islands   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . ttss <dig>  delivers effectors that mediate the invasion of epithelial cells and the intestinal events of typhimurium infection  <cit> . ttss <dig> is required during the systemic phase of typhimurium infection  <cit> . it secretes effectors that allow the survival and multiplication of the pathogen within macrophages  <cit> . the regulation of the typhimurium ttsss is complex with several regulatory proteins involved . spi <dig> encodes five regulators, four of which are known to be involved in regulatory cascades that lead to the expression of genes inside and outside of spi <dig>  <cit> . the central regulator of spi <dig> gene expression is hila, a member of the ompr/toxr family  <cit> . hila directly activates the expression of two spi <dig> operons that encode ttss <dig> apparatus components  <cit> . one of these operons begins with the invf gene, which encodes a transcriptional activator of the arac family. invf activates the expression of ttss <dig> effectors encoded both inside and outside of spi <dig>  <cit> . the activity of invf requires the sica co-regulator which is also encoded within spi <dig>  <cit> . the third and fourth regulators are hilc and hild, both of which belong to the arac family. both can directly activate the expression of hila  <cit> . they can also activate the expression of the invf operon independently of hila  <cit> . the fifth regulator encoded within spi <dig>  sprb, contains a luxr/uhpa helix-turn-helix motif, however no target genes for sprb have been identified  <cit> .

spi <dig> gene expression is also regulated by factors encoded outside of spi <dig> . the sira/bara two-component system is an ancient regulatory system with orthologs found throughout the γ-proteobacteria that is involved in virulence gene expression, exoenzyme and antibiotic production, motility, and biofilm formation  <cit> . in typhimurium, sira has been shown to bind and activate the promoters of hilc and hila  <cit> , although an alternate model has also been proposed in which sira acts through hild rather than through hila and hilc  <cit> . additional regulators of spi <dig> gene expression encoded outside of spi <dig> include the two-component regulatory systems phopq  <cit> , phobr  <cit> , and ompr/envz  <cit> , and the arac-like transcriptional activator rtsa  <cit> . how these regulatory inputs are integrated is not yet known.

the central regulator of spi <dig>  and some ttss <dig> effector genes located outside of spi <dig>  is the ssrab two-component system  <cit> . ssrb has been shown to bind and activate the promoter of the srfh/ssei gene that encodes a ttss <dig> effector  <cit> . similarly, ssrb is thought to directly activate the expression of spi <dig> operons as well as other effector genes located outside of spi <dig>  <cit> . the expression of ssra and ssrb is activated by factors encoded outside of spi <dig> . these include the two-component systems ompr/envz  <cit> , phopq  <cit> , and the slya gene  <cit> . recently the ydgt gene was identified as a negative regulator of spi <dig> gene expression  <cit> .

the effectors secreted by ttss <dig> are required for the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . in contrast, the spi <dig> genes are induced after typhimurium has invaded or is phagocytized by eukaryotic cells  <cit> . these observations led to the hypothesis that ttss <dig> is needed to invade intestinal cells, but is not required during the subsequent phases of typhimurium pathogenesis, while ttss <dig> is expressed only when the bacteria reside within eukaryotic cells. several recent reports suggest a more complicated role of the typhimurium ttsss. for example, spi <dig> mutants have a replication defect and are unable to synthesize a normal scv inside epithelial cells suggesting that spi <dig> genes are involved in these functions  <cit> . conversely, spi <dig> genes have been shown to be involved in the induction of the inflammatory response caused by s. enterica serovar dublin in a bovine ligated-ileal-loop model  <cit>  and to be essential for the full virulence of typhimurium in murine infectious enterocolitis  <cit> . these results suggest that each ttss might be expressed in different compartments within the host, and that at least some effectors might be involved in more than one phase of the infection.

given the complexity of these regulatory hierarchies, we took a systematic in vitro approach to categorizing the regulatory inputs of effector genes in typhimurium. besides examining the effects of individual regulatory mutations on individual effectors, we wanted to test each regulatory gene in the absence of other regulators. for example, the regulatory hierarchy for spi <dig> is complex in that sira activates hila and hilc, hilc also activates hila, and hila and hilc in turn activate invf. invf combined with sica then activates effector genes. since mutations anywhere in the cascade can cause loss of effector gene expression, we chose to test individual members of the cascade for activation of each effector in the absence of all other members of the cascade. this type of approach could reveal if, for instance, sira, hila, or hilc can regulate any effectors independently of invf. this approach might also reveal novel regulatory patterns for individual effectors, for example, effector genes regulated by both spi <dig> and spi <dig> regulators. therefore, in this report we have examined the effects of seven regulatory genes on ten effector genes. the expression of each effector gene was examined in a set of strains lacking all but one of the seven regulators. our results confirm and extend the known regulation of ttss <dig> and ttss <dig> effectors by invf-sica and ssrb respectively.

RESULTS
construction of typhimurium multi-regulator mutant strains harboring laczy fusions to type iii effector genes
we constructed a typhimurium strain that lacks seven regulators, six of which are known to affect the expression of the type iii secretion systems of this bacterium. the ttss1-encoding region of spi <dig>  which harbors five regulatory genes  and a co-regulator , was deleted in a strain that harbors a mutation of the sira gene . transduction of an ssrb mutation into this strain resulted in yd <dig> which lacks seven regulatory genes . chromosomal laczy transcriptional fusions to ten effector genes were then constructed in yd <dig>  these included fusions to genes that encode effectors secreted by ttss <dig> , ttss <dig>  or both . these ten fusions were also transduced into the wild type strain,  <dig>  using phage p22htint.

effects of individual regulators on the expression of the type iii secreted effectors
low copy number plasmids individually encoding seven regulators of spi <dig> or spi <dig>  were transformed into each of the ten strains that carry a laczy fusion in the multi-mutant background. each plasmid was constructed in such a way as to have the regulatory gene expressed from the vector's lac promoter. expression and regulatory activity of the resulting constructs was confirmed using complementation tests with known target genes . the only exception was sprb for which the target genes are not known. the resulting  <dig> strains  were then grown in triplicate to log phase under either spi1-inducing conditions  or spi2-inducing conditions . the β-galactosidase activity of the strains was then determined. the results of spi1-inducing conditions are shown in table  <dig> and the results of spi2-inducing conditions are shown in table  <dig>  for all of the discussion below, any effect less than 3-fold is considered to be no effect.

• ttss <dig> effectors
regardless of growth conditions, the fusions to sopa, sopb, and sope <dig> produced more β-galactosidase in the wild type than in the multi-mutant vector control suggesting that a regulatory factor is missing in the multi-mutant . for sopa the invf-sica plasmid was the only plasmid that restored expression. expression of the sopb fusion was also restored by the invf-sica plasmid. these results confirm previous findings in which invf-sica activates sopa and sopb  <cit> . interestingly, the ssrb plasmid also partially restored sopb expression, but only in spi1-inducing conditions. this is a novel result but the effect of ssrb is quite small compared to the effect of invf so it is not clear if it is physiologically relevant.

the expression of the sope <dig> fusion was decreased in the multi-mutant background and the invf-sica plasmid restored expression . the activation of sope <dig> by invf-sica has not been previously reported. however, a homolog of sope <dig>  the sope gene, has been shown to be regulated by invf-sica  <cit> . the sope <dig> gene is present in all salmonella serovars examined to date, while the presence of sope is sporadic  <cit> . the sope gene was not included in this study because it is not present in our wild-type  <dig> strain. our results suggest that in addition to their similar function, sope and sope <dig> are both regulated by invf-sica.

additionally, all of the above results indicate that the regulators above invf in the spi <dig> regulatory cascade  cannot regulate sopa, sopb, or sope <dig> in the absence of invf.

• slrp and ssph1
ssphl and slrp are known to be secreted by both ttss <dig> and ttss <dig>  <cit> . the ssph <dig> fusion was not decreased in the multi-mutant background compared to the wild-type in either spi <dig> or spi2-inducing conditions, suggesting that none of the seven regulators control ssph <dig>  however, the invf-sica plasmid activated the ssph <dig> fusion by 4-fold compared to the vector control in spi1-inducing conditions . previously miao and miller found that the expression of ssph <dig> is constitutive  <cit> , so it is not clear if the 4-fold effect of a plasmid-encoded regulator is physiologically significant.

expression of the slrp fusion did not decrease in the multi-mutant background in either growth condition, but it was activated 12-fold and 4-fold in the presence of the sprb and invf-sica plasmids, respectively. this effect was only seen in spi1-inducing conditions. both of these results are interesting since no target has been identified for sprb, and invf-sica was not known to regulate slrp. it has been reported that while chromosomal hilc and hild have no effect on slrp, plasmid-encoded hilc and hild do moderately activate slrp expression  <cit> . in this study, the slrp fusion was induced neither by hilc nor by hild in the multi-mutant background suggesting that the previously observed regulation of slrp by hilc and hild is through invf.

to test the activation of the slrp fusion by chromosomal sprb and invf-sica, mutations in these regulators were introduced into an otherwise wild-type background carrying a chromosomal slrp-laczy fusion. none of the mutations affected the expression of the slrp fusion . this is consistent with the lack of a decrease in the multi-mutant background and a previous report in which plasmid-encoded rtsa, hilc, and hild had effects on slrp, but little or no difference in expression was seen with the same regulators expressed from the chromosome  <cit> .

• ttss <dig> effectors
regardless of growth condition, four of the five fusions to ttss <dig> effector genes  were activated by the ssrb-encoding plasmid . this confirms the known activation of these genes by the ssrab two-component system  <cit> . expression of the sifa fusion was not affected in the multi-mutant background compared to the wild-type, regardless of growth condition. additionally, none of the plasmid-encoded regulators altered sifa expression. this result was unexpected since the expression of sifa has previously been shown to depend on ssra, which encodes the sensor kinase component of the ssrab two-component system  <cit> .

to try to reconcile this discrepancy, we constructed a second chromosomal lac fusion to sifa using the method developed by ellermeier et al. . this fusion was moved into the wild type and the multi-mutant backgrounds. the multi-mutant strain was then transformed with the ssrb-encoding plasmid or the pwsk <dig> vector. this sifa fusion was not regulated by ssrb under spi1-inducing conditions and was only regulated 2-fold under spi2-inducing conditions . sifa expression was almost twice as high in the wild-type strain as it was in either the Δssra, Δssrb, or Δssrab strains. furthermore, sifa expression was 2-fold higher in the multi-mutant background containing the ssrb plasmid than it was in the vector control strain .

to test the regulation of sifa by ssrb in another way, we constructed a plasmid that harbours the luxcdabe operon from photorhabdus luminescens under the control of the sifa promoter. this plasmid was placed into the wild type, the ssra mutant, and the ssrb mutant containing either the pssrb plasmid or the vector control. these strains were grown in lb or mgm media and the light emitted by the cells captured using a xenogen ivis imaging system   and measured using a luminometer . the light emitted by the wild type strain is higher in mgm compared to lb showing that the psifa promoter is induced in the mgm medium . the activity of the psifa also decreased strongly in the ssra and the ssrb mutants after growth in both mgm and lb. the pssrb plasmid restored the production of light in the ssrb mutant . these results are consistent with previous findings that sifa is regulated by the ssrab two-component regulatory system. it is not clear why the regulatory effects are seen so clearly with plasmid-encoded fusions and not observed with chromosomal fusions. it is possible that additional layers of regulation are imposed on the chromosomal fusions such as supercoiling or chromatin structure that are relieved on the plasmid.

expression of the sifb fusion was activated by ssrb, as expected  <cit> . however, sifb was also repressed by sira, hilc, and invf. this is an interesting and novel result because a ttss <dig> effector is being repressed by the spi <dig> regulatory cascade. no other effectors are activated by one system and repressed by the other. even more unusual is that sira and hilc had their effects in the multi-mutant background lacking invf. this indicates that sira and hilc are acting on sifb independently of the standard spi <dig> regulatory pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
we have taken a systematic approach to study the regulation of type iii effector genes during growth in vitro. our results confirm that sopa and sopb are activated by invf-sica. in addition we have determined that sope <dig> and ssph <dig> are regulated by invf-sica. the regulation of sope <dig> is very strong under either spi <dig> or spi2-inducing conditions while the regulation of ssph <dig> is weak and only observed under spi1-inducing conditions. the ssph <dig>  sifb, ssei and sseg fusions were shown to be strongly activated by ssrb. the most interesting regulation was observed with sifa and sifb. chromosomal fusions to sifa were largely unaffected by any regulator. however, a plasmid-based sifa fusion was strongly regulated by ssrb. the sifb fusion was strongly regulated by ssrb, as expected. however, it was also strongly repressed by sira, hilc, and invf. this is the first indication that sira and hilc might regulate an effector gene independently of invf. the set of strains constructed for this study can now be used to quickly and systematically study the regulation of newly identified effector genes.
