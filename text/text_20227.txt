BACKGROUND
colorectal carcinoma  is the third most common form of cancer in the world, and the rectum exhibits common internal malignancies  <cit> . oxaliplatin  is a third generation platinum antitumor compound. clinically, it is now approved as first-line chemotherapy in combination with other antitumor drugs for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer  <cit> . it contains a bulky carrier ligand within its structure, and forms dna adducts that more effectively inhibit dna synthesis; however, these adducts are generally considered to be more cytotoxic than those of either cisplatin or carboplatin  <cit> . cytotoxic drugs exhibit obvious toxicity on the human body, affecting neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal reaction, and cardiotoxicity, etc.  <cit> ; moreover, the non-selective nature of cytotoxic drugs regarding normal and pathological tissue poses a challenge for the treatment of tumors. conventional chemotherapy is not as effective in colorectal cancer as it is in other cancers since the drug does not reach the target site in an effective concentration  <cit> . thus, effective treatment demands an increased dose, which may lead to negative side effects. if drugs were targeted to the tumor cells, these limitations would be overcome, and this in turn would be advantageous for the cancer treatment.

liposomes are small, spherically shape vesicles that can be produced from cholesterols, non-toxic surfactants, sphingolipids, glycolipids, long chain fatty acids and even membrane proteins. liposomes were among the first nanomolecular drug delivery systems to demonstrate the increased delivery of small molecular weight anticancer drugs to solid tumors by altering the biodistribution of associated drugs  <cit> . it has been previously reported that liposomes attach to cellular membranes and appear to fuse with them, thus releasing their contents into the cells  <cit> . alternatively, liposomes are taken up by the cell, their phospholipids are incorporated into the cell membrane, and the drug trapped inside is then released  <cit> . common liposomes, though, were in the body for only a short duration, and many were phagocytized by the reticuloendothelial system . however, the  <dig> -distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-n-  modification to the surface of a liposome potentially prevents interactions in-vivo, thus extending the circulation lifetime of the liposome  <cit> . in tumor tissue, because tumor cells grow so quickly, newly formed tumor vessels are comprised of poorly-aligned and defective endothelial cells with wide fenestrations that lack a smooth muscle layer and innervation with the wider lumen. furthermore, tumor tissues usually lack effective lymphatic drainage  <cit> . tumor microvessel permeability is 400~ <dig> nm with permeability for macromolecules having a molecular weight of  <dig>  × 104~ <dig> ×  <dig> da  <cit> . these factors lead to abnormal molecular and fluid transport dynamics. therefore, enhancement of the extravasation of certain sizes of molecules, such as macromolecular drugs or liposomes, leads to a much greater accumulation in tumour tissue versus normal tissue. due to the tumor selective enhanced permeability and retention effect , this results in extensive extravasation of the liposomes  <cit> . in solid tumours, the epr effect is a universal phenomenon in which liposomes are passively targeted to tumour tissue, ultimately leading to enhanced accumulation of the liposomes in the tumor interstitium  <cit> .

recently, fad of usa approved a few liposomal products, such as evacet, am bison, and doxorubicin in a long-circulating peg-coated liposome. there have been initial reports indicating that the use of individual functionalities has been demonstrated to be associated with highly positive clinical outcomes  <cit> . however, there is currently no commercially available peg-liposomal l-ohp product, and studies are still in the experimental stage. there are few reports published regarding peg-liposomal l-ohp treatment of colorectal cancer. here, we investigated the therapeutic tumour targeting activity of peg-liposomal l-ohp in-vitro in sw <dig> cells and in-vivo in a nude mice solid tumour model.

RESULTS
characteristics of long-circulating liposomes  and cellular uptake
we selected an increased particle size of peg-liposomes through a series of filtration steps using a polycarbonate membrane filter at a pore size of  <dig> nm. peg-liposomes with a particle size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and zeta-potential of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv were obtained, as determined by laser grain size analysis. the entrapment efficiency of the liposomes was % as determined by hplc. these values are higher than those reported recently by another group. flow cytometry demonstrated that after incubation in medium containing dio-labeled liposomes for  <dig> h, the peg-liposomes conjugated with cells, and exhibited an enhanced mean fluorescence intensity upon extended induction time; the mean fluorescence intensity at  <dig> h was  <dig> -fold greater than the intensity measured at  <dig> h. the immunofluorescence assay revealed considerable aggregation of liposomes within cells at  <dig> h .

in-vitro drug release and cell viability assay
we used the dialysis method to evaluate l-ohp release from encapsulated pge-liposomes in-vitro, and the drug concentration was then analyzed by hplc. the cumulative percentage release demonstrated that the amount of drug released from peg-liposomes was gradually increased over time, and after  <dig> h there was an increase of over 89%. the free drug exhibited the highest level  at  <dig> h, confirming the fact that peg-liposomes act as a barrier against diffusion of hydrophilic drugs.

the viability of cells was analyzed by the mtt colorimetric assay after treatment with empty peg-liposomes , free l-ohp  and peg-liposomal l-ohp , respectively. cell viability was decreased with the length of exposure, with a maximum reduction occurring at  <dig> h. the empty peg-liposomes exhibited significantly less cytotoxicity.

analysis of apoptosis
upon exposure of sw <dig> cells to free l-ohp or peg-liposomal l-ohp, cellular apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, which demonstrated that peg-liposomal l-ohp induced sw <dig> apoptotic incidence of % . the gel electrophoretic analysis of internucleosomal dna fragmentation demonstrated the presence of primarily high molecular weight dna as seen with the untreated control. a dna ladder pattern, the typical feature of apoptosis, was distinctly observed .

tumour tissue and dio-labeled liposomes
dio-labeled liposomes were intravenously injected via the tail vein , and then visualized in the tumour tissue by an in-vivo imaging system. after  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h, typical representative images were captured . the fluorescence intensity distribution of tumour tissue in the animals was indicated by green fluorescence. the fluorescence intensity was maintained at a high level for an extended period of  <dig> h. however, immediately following intravenous injections, little fluorescence was observed, excluding part of the tail. the fluorescence was observed through  <dig> h, indicating that peg-liposomes may continue accumulation.

in-vivo antitumor effect of peg-liposomal l-ohp
rapid tumour growth was observed in the mouse control group; however, significant tumor growth suppression was demonstrated in mice treated with peg-liposomal l-ohp . the tumour suppression was %, and peg-liposomal l-ohp demonstrated the strongest effect on the survival time - all of the mice treated with peg-liposomal l-ohp became long-term survivors  . throughout the therapeutic experiment, a noticeable cachexia condition was observed in the control group, and although no bodyweight loss was observed in any of the treated groups, weight loss was significant in the control group . these results suggest that treatment with peg-liposomal l-ohp improves the median survival time  of tumor-bearing mice without causing remarkable toxicity.

bcl- <dig>  bax mrna and protein expression in tumour tissue
to elucidate whether the growth inhibitory effect of peg-liposomal l-ohp was attributable to the induction of apoptosis, bcl- <dig> and bax were analyzed by rt-pcr or western blot in tumour tissue. on day  <dig> after treatment, tumours were resected and total rna and protein were extracted from the tumour tissue. our experiments demonstrated that mrna expression levels of bcl- <dig> were remarkably decreased in the peg-liposomal l-ohp group;  <dig> -fold compared with free l-ohp, whereas, bax mrna increased  <dig> -fold compared with free l-ohp . protein expression tendency of bcl- <dig> and bax were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold in comparison, respectively . these results indicated that apoptosis was strongly induced by peg-liopsomal l-ohp.

discussion
the non-selectivity of cytotoxic drugs between normal tissue and the pathological site poses a tumor treatment strategy challenge. to obtain increased therapeutic efficacy, a drug carrier must achieve increased delivery of the drug to the tumor tissue, while also allowing for enhanced interaction of the drug with, and subsequent internalization by, tumor cells. liposomes, as carriers of chemotherapeutic agents, are able to change the distribution of these agents within the body and decrease their toxicity  <cit> . therefore, drug-loaded liposomes offer a new approach for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

polyethylene glycol -coated liposomes , are stable and not easy to be taken up by cells of the reticuloendothelial system , and exhibit reduced drug leakage compared with conventional liposomes  <cit> . it has been previously reported that peg modification of liposomes increases their affinity to cancer cells and increases the cellular uptake of drugs  <cit> . the toxicity of peg-liposomes for cells should be taken into consideration, and some previous reports have indicated that the toxicity is indeed lower  <cit> . in our experiment, the empty peg-liposomes in-vitro exhibited significantly less cytotoxicity for sw <dig> cells. the tumour cells took up large numbers of peg- liposomes, which is in concordance with reports by other groups  <cit> . however, peg-liposomes containing a drug increase toxicity. our mtt assays showed that peg-liposomal l-ohp  had significantly greater cytotoxic effects than free oxaliplatin . when we assessed their effects on apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry and the dna ladder method, we observed that, at an identical dose, peg-liposomal l-ohp demonstrated a significantly greater effect on apoptosis than did free l-ohp. peg-liposomes exhibited tumour-targeted delivery in these cells.

previous studies have demonstrated that peg-modified liposomes act primarily through vesicular organelles, and are preferentially taken up by angiogenic tumour endothelium  <cit> . to obtain sufficient antitumor activity with liposomal anticancer drugs, optimization of the therapeutic regimen is of great importance. in solid tumours , the permeability of the vasculature is generally increased compared to normal tissues  <cit> . therefore, these may provide a channel allowing liposomes to more easily target tumour tissue. after receiving intravenous injections of dio-labeled peg-liposomes, mice were able to survive. experiments presented in this study indicate that peg-liposomes efficiently accumulate in tumor tissue , and maintain a high level over  <dig> h, which is in concordance with previous reports from other groups  <cit> . furthermore, the fluorescence remained detectable even after  <dig> h. the plasma clearance of anionic molecules occurred more slowly than for cationic molecules  <cit> . based upon evidence from the in-vitro cell experiments and the mouse tumour model, a higher concentration and longer blood residence time of liposomes would result in greater efficiency of extravasation per unit volume of convective transport  <cit> , and this would explain the fact that liposomes remain in the tumor tissue.

additionally, to investigate the treatment availability of peg-liposomal l-ohp, bcl- <dig> and bax were evaluated. bcl- <dig> and bax are members of the bcl- <dig> family, bax is a proapoptotic protein that induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization , causing the release of caspase activating proteins. in contrast, bcl- <dig> is an anti-apoptotic protein and guardian of the outer membrane and it preserves its integrity by opposing bax; they are associated with apoptosis necrosis, and autophagy, and regulate all major types of cell death  <cit> . we used the level of genes and protein to indicate treatment results. after treatment with peg-liposomal l-ohp, tumour cell predominance of apoptosis in tumor-bearing nude mice was induced, and bcl- <dig> mrna and protein expression were down-regulated, whereas bax was up-regulated . this demonstrated that such liposomal l-ohp formulation exhibits potent in-vivo antitumor activity, presumably via a dual targeting approach against both tumour endothelial cells and tumour cells  <cit> .

the peg-liposomal l-ohp accumulated in the tumour tissue, following uptake by endothelial cells as well as tumor cells, and liposomes were then degraded, while intracellular drug delivery increased the concentration of drug within cells and slowed drug efflux  <cit> . these findings indicate that liposome encapsulation of chemotherapeutic drugs enhances their damaging effects on tumour cells. at present, fda approved liposomal products  have the advantage of high encapsulation efficiency, rapid release rate, and so forth. as to our study, further research is needed in order to improve drug encapsulation efficiency and stability, as well as further studies involving dynamic research in a clinical setting.

CONCLUSIONS
the experiments presented in this report indicate that peg-liposomal l-ohp achieves a better therapeutic response than the equivalent dose of free l-ohp, and it indicates the potentially wide application for this type of drug target for tumors and other tissues, with the advantage of the ability to overcome some major limitations in conventional anticancer chemotherapy. this study may provide the rationale for the clinical application of crc. nevertheless, further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.
