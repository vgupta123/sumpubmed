BACKGROUND
gene and genome duplications are the primary source of new genes and have played a pivotal role in the evolution of genomic and organismal complexity . the rates of spontaneous gene duplication and deletion are extraordinarily high and speak to the enormous potential of these structural variants for generating new adaptive variability . however, most gene duplicates are eventually lost from populations due to a variety of reasons: genetic drift or natural selection, inherent instability of tandem duplications, and relaxed selection against detrimental mutations . although, gene duplications and deletions contribute significantly to the immense standing genetic variation related to gene copy-number observed in natural populations , the relative importance of genetic drift versus natural selection in determining their evolutionary fate remains obscure.

ohno  <cit>  theorized that newly duplicated genes were freed from the constraints of natural selection, implicating a dominant role of genetic drift in their early evolutionary dynamics. likewise, genetic drift is assumed to be the dominant force in the early evolutionary history of duplicate genes under the ddc  model  <cit> . in contrast, natural selection for increased gene expression may represent an important mechanism by which duplicate gene copies are maintained in populations  <cit> . there is ample evidence for the preservation of multiple gene copies due to selection for increased gene dosage in diverse organisms  <cit> . for example, adaptation to novel or resource-limited environments in laboratory populations frequently involves segmental duplications . likewise, natural populations harbor duplications that are clearly adaptive under novel environmental regimes . in addition, loss-of-function mutations can often be suppressed or compensated for by multiple copies, or increased transcription of another gene in the genome . the spontaneous rate of gene deletions is of a similar magnitude as that of duplications  <cit> . there is evidence that deletions tend to be more detrimental to fitness than duplications  <cit> . however, gene loss has also been associated with adaptation in diverse systems .

we have previously established that the spontaneous, genome-wide rate of gene duplication in c. elegans is two orders of magnitude higher than the point mutation rate  <cit> . in this study, we seek to determine if gene copy-number changes are a common class of genetic change during adaptation and what role, if any, natural selection plays in the maintenance and frequency increase of copy-number variants  in experimental populations. gene copy-number changes were analyzed in experimental lines of c. elegans which had been subjected to  fitness decline via mutation accumulation, and  subsequent adaptive fitness recovery during population expansion for > <dig> generations. in addition, control lines maintained at large population sizes without having been subjected to mutation accumulation were also analyzed for copy-number changes. we used an obligately outcrossing strain of c. elegans to reduce the effects of genetic hitchhiking  <cit> . these fitness-recovered populations were subsequently analyzed for copy-number changes to directly test if recovery lines display high rates of duplications and deletions, and to determine the role of these cnvs in adaptive evolution.

RESULTS
fitness decline during mutation accumulation  and subsequent fitness increase following population expansion
this experimental evolution study comprised two distinct phases,  a mutation accumulation with a msh- <dig> knockdown  phase , followed by  an adaptive recovery phase in the absence of msh- <dig> knockdown . figure  <dig> displays the fitness trajectories of the five focal experimental lines via three fitness assays spanning both phases of the experiment , as measured by the life-history trait productivity. ancestral pre-ma control lines had a mean productivity value of  <dig> progeny and were assigned a relative mean productivity value of  <dig> . at  <dig> ma generations, the mean productivity of the five experimental lines ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig> progeny . the mean productivity of the five focal ma lines at the termination of the ma l phase  was  <dig> offspring and the individual mean productivity of the five experimental ma lines ranged from 2– <dig> progeny . anova analyses found a significant variance component for productivity  between the control and the five ma lines.fig.  <dig> illustration of caenorhabditis elegans experimental evolution study with mutation accumulation  and adaptive recovery phases. a the ma experiment was initiated by establishing  <dig> lines descended from a single, mated fog- <dig> female whose additional descendants were expanded for several generations and frozen as ancestral, pre-ma controls. each generation, the ma regime comprised  population bottlenecks of one random female worm and two male siblings  per generation, and  rnai-mediated knockdown of the mismatch repair gene msh- <dig>  the ma experiment with msh- <dig> rnai was terminated at  <dig> generations and extant ma lines were subjected to  <dig> additional generations of full-sib mating without msh- <dig> rnai to maximize homozygosity. b to enable fitness/adaptive recovery of mutationally degraded lines, five ma lines  exhibiting the greatest decline in fitness following the ma regime were expanded into five sublines  and independently maintained at large population sizes in the absence of msh- <dig> rnai. new generations were established every four days by agar chunk transfers that enabled maintenance of large population sizes across generations. for simplicity, the fitness recovery phase displayed in the figure only depicts population expansion for one ma line and its five descendant sublines, a-e

following  <dig> generations of population expansion, we observed modest to substantial fitness recovery in the experimental lines . the mean productivity of the  <dig> adaptive recovery populations  ranged from 115– <dig> progeny, and relative productivity of  <dig> – <dig>  . populations 16a-e, descended from ma <dig>  exhibited complete fitness recovery to ancestral levels with respect to productivity . populations 66a-e exhibited substantial fitness recovery to 73 % of ancestral levels with respect to productivity . populations 7a-e, 19a-e, and 50a-e, descended from ma <dig>  ma <dig>  and ma <dig>  respectively, had modest increases in productivity, ranging from 25–33 % of ancestral levels . the mean productivity of the five ma following  <dig> generations and the  <dig> recovery populations following ~ <dig> generations was  <dig> and  <dig> offspring, respectively. anova analyses found a significant variance component for productivity between the mutation accumulation lines and the recovery populations .

cnvs comprise a common class of genetic change during adaptive recovery
oacgh detected  <dig> duplication events in  <dig> of the  <dig> experimental populations subjected to adaptive recovery following population expansion after mutation accumulation . a single duplication event was identified in one of the five fog- <dig> control populations , which had been maintained at a large population size without having been subjected to a prior mutation accumulation phase. the duplication spans ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in length, encompassing  <dig> to  <dig> protein-coding genes . the median duplication span was  <dig>  kb and the median number of protein-coding genes per duplication was  <dig>  in addition, there were  <dig> deletions in  <dig> of the  <dig> adaptive recovery populations. an additional seven deletions were observed in the five fog- <dig> control populations . the length distribution of deletions was markedly different from that of duplications. the deletion spans ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, resulting in the deletion of zero to  <dig> protein-coding genes . the median deletion span was  <dig>  kb and the median number of protein-coding genes deleted was one. none of these copy-number changes in the adaptive recovery phase were detected in the ma lines via  microarray analysis using the ma lines as the experimental lines and the common ancestor of all ma lines as a reference,  qpcr, and  pcr and sequencing of duplication and deletion breakpoints. hence, they appear to have occurred and increased in frequency during the population expansion phase associated with adaptive recovery.table  <dig> summary of duplications in experimental c. elegans lines following  <dig> consecutive generations of population expansion

duplications and deletions during adaptive recovery are significantly larger than those arising under mutation accumulation conditions
we further compared the size of cnvs originating in the adaptive recovery populations to spontaneously-occurring cnvs previously investigated in c. elegans lines comprising a long-term ma experiment with extreme bottlenecks of ne =  <dig>  <cit> . the duplication span in our adaptive recovery populations is significantly greater than that of previously determined spontaneous duplications under mutation accumulation conditions  <cit>  . duplications in populations subjected to adaptive recovery had a median duplication span of  <dig>  kb versus a median span of  <dig>  kb in spontaneous mutation accumulation populations  <cit>  under the influence of genetic drift. similarly, we detected significantly larger deletion spans in the adaptive recovery populations compared to spontaneous deletions occurring under mutation accumulation conditions . the median spans of deletions in our adaptive recovery and mutation accumulation populations  <cit>  were  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively.fig.  <dig> comparison of duplication and deletion spans in adaptive recovery versus spontaneous mutation accumulation  lines. a the span of  <dig> independent duplication events in the adaptive recovery populations compared to the duplication span of  <dig> spontaneous duplications during ma  <cit> . the span of duplications during adaptive recovery is significantly larger than duplications detected under spontaneous ma conditions . b the span of  <dig> deletion events in the adaptive recovery populations compared to the deletion span of  <dig> spontaneous deletions during ma  <cit> . the deletion span for  <dig> deletion events in the adaptive recovery populations was significantly greater than the span of spontaneous deletions during ma 



gradual increase in the frequencies of cnvs during the adaptive recovery phase
based on the oacgh arrays, the average population wide copy-number of the  <dig> duplications ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  copies per haploid genome . assuming that individuals harboring duplications only contain one additional copy of the duplicated segment, the frequency of individual duplications in the populations range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average copy-number for the deleted segments ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting that the frequency of these deletions in the populations range from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

in light of the oacgh results following > <dig> recovery generations, qpcr was used to analyze the frequencies of duplications and deletions following approximately  <dig>   <dig> and,  <dig> recovery generations. in the majority of the populations, duplications and deletions that had reached high frequencies by generations 180– <dig> were found in intermediate frequencies at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> generations, providing evidence of a gradual increase in the frequencies of individual cnvs with time . based on the oacgh results in table  <dig>  duplications in two populations had reached fixation by recovery generation  <dig> . however, based on the qpcr results, three additional duplications appear to have reached fixation in their respective populations  . the pattern of increase in the frequency of cnvs is particularly striking in the case of several deletions . the oacgh results suggested that six deletions reached high frequency and that the deleted segment is only in 4–9 % frequency in these populations . moreover, the qpcr results for these cnvs suggest that five deletions were already fixed by recovery generations 140– <dig> in these populations  and one additional deletion  had reached fixation by recovery generation  <dig>  in general, there was a good correlation between the oacgh and qpcr estimates of the frequency of copy-number changes  in the populations at recovery generation  <dig> .fig.  <dig> increase in the frequency of parallel duplication events in  <dig> independent populations containing an overlapping region on chromosome v. the average copy-number per haploid genome was calculated from qpcr results and is indicated on the vertical axis. the vertical lines indicate the 95 % bootstrap confidence intervals. the generation from which the copy-number was estimated is indicated on the horizontal axis

duplication breakpoints in independent populations occur at unique sites within the same repetitive sequences
our attempts to precisely map the duplication and deletion breakpoints with pcr and dna sequencing yielded mixed results. we were able to sequence five duplication breakpoints from the set of  <dig> duplications in table  <dig>  in addition, we generated breakpoint sequences for seven deletion events in table  <dig>  four duplication breakpoints on chromosome v, in populations 16b, 16e, 66e and control population c <dig>  are located within the same 1031 bp repeats flanking the duplications and appear to be the result of unequal crossing-over. the sequence identity between the two repeats is 96 % and the point of unequal crossing-over within the repeats is different in all four cases, confirming that these were independent events . the seven deletions with sequenced breakpoints are 16a:chrx, 16d:chrv, 19a:chrx, 50d:chrv, 50e:chrv, 66b:chrx, and c3:chrx . these sequenced deletions do not appear to be associated with repeat motifs.fig.  <dig> breakpoints of the four common duplications on chromosome v compared to their flanking repeats. four independent populations contain a duplication of a region between positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> on chromosome v. these duplications are the product of unequal crossing-over between two  <dig>  bp repeats that are 96 % identical and flank the duplication. the figure shows polymorphic sites between the two repeats, and the nucleotides flanking the breakpoints of the four duplications. the sequences of the upstream and downstream repeats are displayed on the topmost  and lowermost  rows, respectively. the sequence of the new repeat in the center of the tandem duplication is shown for strains 16b, 66e, 16e, and c <dig>  and the correspondence to the original flanking repeats is indicated by color. the duplication breakpoint is inferred to be between the sequence that corresponds to the downstream repeat  and the upstream repeat 



extensive parallelism in copy-number changes of certain cnvs
twelve duplications in  <dig> independent recovery populations and one control population span an overlapping region on chromosome v which extends up to ~59 kb and contains  <dig> protein-coding genes . the range of duplication spans encompassing this overlapping region in the  <dig> populations range from ~139–661 kb. gene ontology  annotations report the function of four of these  <dig> duplicated orfs  as unclassified with respect to biological process, cellular component and molecular function. four of the  <dig> duplicated orfs have their molecular function defined as protein-binding  or carbohydrate-binding . duplicated gene daf- <dig> is probably the best-characterized locus within this shared region on chromosome v. it encodes a beta-type insulin and inhibits dauer formation  <cit>  and influences adult life-span, two potentially important life-history traits that could be under selection during the adaptive recovery regime of the experiment. pcp- <dig> exhibits serine-type peptidase activity and is involved in proteolysis whereas srw- <dig> codes for a protein product that serves as an integral component of membranes.fig.  <dig> location and span of convergent duplication events. the populations are indicated to the left, the chromosomal position is shown on the horizontal axis and the average haploid copy-number based on the oacgh results from generation  <dig> is indicated on the right. the horizontal bars designate the regions that are duplicated in each of these populations. the vertical orange lines indicate the boundaries of the shared segment among these duplications. a overlapping duplications on chromosome v during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment. the 59 kb region shared among all  <dig> populations is delineated by the vertical lines that run through the horizontal bars. b overlapping duplications on chromosome ii during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment. the 94 kb region shared among the two populations is delineated by the vertical lines that run through the horizontal bars. c overlapping duplications on chromosome iv during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment. the 141 kb region shared among the two populations is delineated by the vertical lines that run through the horizontal bars



the convergent duplications on chromosome ii ,  and chromosome iv ,  encompass larger overlapping regions , and have lower average copy-numbers relative to the convergent duplications on chromosome v . the convergent or overlapping duplications on chromosome ii are found in two populations and span  <dig> protein-coding orfs of which  <dig> are unclassified with respect to biological process, cellular component and molecular function. for the remaining  <dig> orfs, we note that ten orfs  have biological processes related to important life-history traits involving some combination of reproduction, dauer development, embryo development, determination of adult lifespan and oogenesis. the convergent duplications on chromosome iv occur in two populations and span  <dig> protein-coding orfs of which  <dig> are unclassified with respect to biological process, cellular component and molecular function. of the remaining  <dig> orfs, six orfs  have biological processes related to the very same life-history traits observed for the overlapping duplication on chromosome ii.

additionally, we also observed five convergent deletions that spanned overlapping regions in independent populations. cumulatively, these five convergent deletions comprise  <dig> independent deletion events observed in  <dig> adaptive recovery populations and all five control populations. one convergent deletion in four control populations of the adaptive recovery phase  spanned ~ <dig>  kb and resulted from a copy-number loss in four rdna genes at the end of chromosome i  . our qpcr results suggest that the fog- <dig> strain, ancestral to all of the populations in these experiments, possesses  <dig> copies of this repeat. in these four control populations, the number of rdna repeats has been reduced by 21–40 % .fig.  <dig> location and span of convergent deletion events. the populations are indicated to the left, the chromosomal position is shown on the horizontal axis and the average haploid copy-number based on the oacgh results from generation  <dig> is indicated on the right. the horizontal bars designate the regions that are deleted in each of these populations. the vertical orange lines indicate the boundaries of the shared segment among these deletions. a overlapping deletion on chromosome i during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment. the ~ <dig>  kb region shared among four control populations  is delineated by the vertical lines that run through the horizontal bars. b overlapping deletion on chromosome v during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment. the  <dig>  kb region shared among the six adaptive recovery populations is delineated by the vertical lines that run through the horizontal bars. c overlapping deletions on chromosome x during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment. the  <dig>  kb region shared among three adaptive recovery and one control population is delineated by the vertical lines that run through the horizontal bars. d overlapping deletions on chromosome x during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment. the  <dig>  kb region shared among the two adaptive recovery and one control population is delineated by the vertical lines that run through the horizontal bars



a second convergent deletion event was detected in six adaptive recovery populations  and led to the loss of an overlapping  <dig>  bp region on chromosome v encompassing four protein-coding orfs . three of these orfs are unclassified with respect to go annotations. the last orf, cyp-33a <dig> , was partially deleted and is classified as a heme- and iron-ion binding protein involved in the oxidation-reduction process.

the third convergent deletion event occurred in three adaptive recovery populations  and one control population . this deletion entailed the loss of an overlapping 3934 bp region partially encompassing a single protein-coding gene, daf- <dig>  on chromosome x . daf- <dig> is classified as an enhancer sequence-specific dna-binding protein involved in dauer larval development among its biological processes.

the fourth convergent deletion event occurred in three populations  resulting in the loss of an overlapping 629 bp region partially encompassing a single protein-coding gene, ceh- <dig>  on chromosome x . ceh- <dig> is classified as a dna- and protein-binding protein involved in the regulation of transcription and thermosensory behavior, with ceh- <dig> mutants exhibiting lack of thermotaxis. in all cases, the deletion appears to have reached fixation within the populations. although two of these deletions occurred in populations undergoing adaptive recovery following ma, one occurred in a control population that had not been subjected to ma and adaptive recovery. interestingly, a lone deletion event in another gene on the x chromosome implicated in thermotaxis  <cit> , ncs- <dig>  also reached fixation in strain 66d .

lastly, a fifth convergent deletion event occurred in two adaptive recovery populations, 50c and 50d. this deletion resulting in the loss of one end of the x chromosome reached a significant frequency in both populations. the deletion span in 50d was approximately 22 kb larger than the deletion in 50c. the average haploid copy- number of this segment was  <dig>  and  <dig>  in 50c and 50d, respectively, which translates into 15 % and 19 % of the x chromosomes bearing this segmental deletion in populations 50c and 50d, respectively. the overlapping 272 kb region in these two deletions contains  <dig> protein-coding genes .  <dig> of these  <dig> orfs are unclassified with respect to go annotations. for the remaining  <dig> orfs, six orfs  have biological processes related to important life-history and developmental traits involving some combination of reproduction, embryo development ending in birth or egg hatching, nematode larval development, hermaphrodite genitalia development and negative regulation of vulval development.

single-worm pcr suggests simple duplications rather than higher-level amplifications
independent estimates of cnv frequencies via single-worm pcr of cnv breakpoints confirmed the gradual increase of cnvs and are strongly correlated with the copy-number estimates from qpcr . there was one instance where the single-worm pcr results deviated significantly from the qpcr results, in line 16b following  <dig> generations of adaptive recovery. both the qpcr and oacgh data suggest that the duplication was present in low frequency in generation  <dig>  in contrast, single-worm pcr estimated the duplication to exist at an intermediate frequency of  <dig>  in the population. it is possible that some of the copy-number increases in these populations are due to a higher level of amplification  than a single duplication. if the copy-number is frequently > two per haploid genome, we expect that the copy-number calculated from qpcr would systematically exceed the estimates from single-worm pcr. however, this is not the case, and the generally good agreement between the different methods suggests that higher-level amplification is not widespread for the three duplications with single-worm pcr estimates.table  <dig> frequencies of cnvs in experimental c. elegans lines at different time intervals of population expansion using single-worm pcr

discussion
in the last decade, analysis of gene copy-number variation has shown that cnvs are surprisingly widespread in natural populations. like other classes of mutations, these variants can be beneficial, neutral or deleterious. however, gene copy-number increases are unique among mutations in that they can facilitate the evolution of novel genes. the population dynamics of gene copy-number variation in populations are therefore important for understanding both the adaptation and evolution of novel genes. in this study, we investigated whether gene copy-number changes  constituted a common form of genetic change during the adaptation of low-fitness experimental populations of c. elegans.

several lines of evidence suggest that the high frequency of copy-number changes in the adaptive recovery and control populations are primarily due to natural selection. both deletions and duplications increased in frequency with time, and some rearrangements had already reached fixation by  <dig> generations of population expansion. the theoretical expectation for the average number of generations until fixation of a neutral mutation under conditions of genetic drift is 4ne generations  <cit> . assuming a lower-bound conservative estimate of ne =  <dig> individuals in the adaptive recovery populations each generation, neutral cnvs in our experimental populations would take, on average, more than  <dig> generations to reach fixation. five duplications and eight deletions in our adaptive recovery and control populations originated and reached fixation within only  <dig> generations. moreover, the majority of other cnvs that had not yet reached fixation by the end of the recovery phase still exhibited a steady increase in population frequency with time. furthermore, both duplications and deletions contained striking examples of parallelism or convergent evolution. certain duplications and deletions contained overlapping regions, i.e. the same region was duplicated or deleted independently in different populations .

duplications of parts of chromosome v contained the same 59 kb region in eleven independent adaptive recovery populations and one control population . if these duplications had been experiencing selection for higher dosage, one or more of these genes could be under selection in all  <dig> strains. one of the best-characterized genes within this overlapping duplication was daf- <dig>  a pleiotropic gene influencing several life-history traits such as adult lifespan and suppression of dauer formation. for instance, if a copy-number increase entails greater daf- <dig> expression, the incidence of dauer formation may be further suppressed. in another example of convergence, daf- <dig> is deleted in three independent adaptive recovery populations and one control population . daf- <dig> promotes dauer formation and the deletion is expected to suppress dauer. hence, we have convergent duplications and deletions in  <dig> independent populations that are expected to reduce the incidence of dauer formation. we hypothesize that both the duplication of daf- <dig> and deletion of daf- <dig> may be adaptations to a predictable and frequent availability of a food source, in this case a fresh lawn of escherichia coli. other examples of convergence in these populations include the partial deletion of a gene, ceh- <dig>  in three populations as detected by oacgh . the ceh- <dig> gene contributes to thermosensing and thermotaxis in c. elegans  <cit> . another gene implicated in thermotaxis, ncs- <dig>  is also deleted in strain 66d  <cit> .

this form of parallel evolution is best explained by selection for increased gene dosage in the case of duplications  <cit> , and selection against a gene in the case of the deletions . parallel molecular evolution is frequently observed in experimental population studies, particularly in microbial systems . in large microbial populations, the chance that the same beneficial mutation will occur in independently-evolving lineages is reasonably high. compensatory evolution experiments with hermaphroditic c. elegans populations have also found parallel nucleotide substitutions at two sites in two independent populations  <cit> . the high frequency of parallel gene copy-number changes following the population expansion phase in this study is likely due to the high rates of spontaneous copy-number mutations in concert with natural selection . because spontaneous gene duplications and deletions originate at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than point mutations, the probability that copy-number changes in the same genes occur in independent populations is much greater than the same point mutation occurring in independent populations. furthermore, higher mutation rates improve the probability that new variants increase in frequency or reach fixation  <cit> .

there is a striking difference in the size distribution of spontaneous duplications and deletions detected in ma studies and their size distribution in these populations undergoing adaptive recovery. in a preceding c. elegans spontaneous mutation accumulation experiment with minimal influence of natural selection, the spontaneous duplications ranged from 1–30 kb in length, with a median duplication span of 2 kb  <cit> . in this study of duplications and deletions in adapting c. elegans populations following an experimental phase of fitness decline, the size range of duplications originating in the adaptive recovery phase with population expansion was  <dig> –661 kb with a median duplication span of  <dig>  kb. a similar trend was observed in the case of deletions originating in the adaptive recovery phase. the spontaneous deletions originating during the mutation accumulation experiment ranged from  <dig> –32 kb in length, with a median deletion span of  <dig>  kb  <cit> . during the adaptive recovery phase in this study, the size range of deletions was  <dig> –295 kb and the median deletion span was ~ <dig>  kb. admittedly, we are comparing the size distributions of cnvs in two different strains, the selfing laboratory strain n <dig>  <cit>  and the obligately outcrossing loss-of-function fog- <dig> strain in this study. the large difference in the size distribution can be explained by selection for gene dosage in the recovery populations. the larger the cnv span, the greater the chance that a gene  under selection for altered gene dosage will be contained within the duplication or deletion. this may be a general phenomenon and we predict that recent copy-number variants that are being maintained in natural populations are, on average, larger than the average spontaneous duplication or deletion.

it is possible that sex-biased transmission of copy-number changes contribute to differences in the span of duplications and deletions between mutation accumulation experiments in self-fertilizing c. elegans and the outcrossing populations in this study. there is evidence that smaller chromosomes tend to segregate with the x chromosome in c. elegans  <cit> . this sex-biased transmission would not influence the distribution of duplication and deletion spans in outcrossing populations such as the fog- <dig> mutants in the experiments described here. the transmission bias could introduce a downward bias in duplication span and an upward bias in deletion span in selfing c. elegans. hence, we would expect to see larger duplications and smaller deletions in outcrossing populations relative to the mutation accumulation lines. however, this bias may be negligible in ma experiments with c. elegans hermaphrodites because gametes lacking the x chromosome are produced infrequently  and the opportunities for sex-biased transmission to favor shorter chromosomes in gametes containing the x chromosome would be very limited. moreover, the results presented here show that both duplications and deletions are larger in the adaptive recovery populations than in mutation accumulation lines, which is not predicted by the transmission bias hypothesis. additionally, the appearance and increase in the frequency of gene duplications and deletions in large adaptive recovery populations is unlikely to be a direct consequence of the msh- <dig> treatment during mutation accumulation. first, following the completion of the ma phase, the experimental lines were inbred for  <dig> additional generations in the absence of msh- <dig> knockdown via rnai, so it is unlikely that there are any residual effects of the rnai treatment per se. moreover, all the copy-number changes reported here were not detected in the post-ma ancestor and appear to have arisen during the adaptive recovery phase of the experiment.

four of  <dig> populations that contained a large overlapping duplication on chromosome v  possessed duplication breakpoints in the same 1 kb repeats . these repeats appear to be duplication hot-spots. however, this type of duplication was not detected in our previous study of the spontaneous duplication and deletion rate in the c. elegans genome, nor in the ma populations within this study. although this region may experience a higher than average duplication rate, this alone does not appear to account for the high frequency of individuals possessing this duplication within these independent populations. mutation pressure  is a very weak force in changing the frequency of alleles   <cit> . the spontaneous duplication and deletion rates in c. elegans are on the order of 10−7/gene/generation  <cit> . even after allowing for a 1000-fold higher rate of origin of a particular duplication than the best estimate of the spontaneous gene duplication rate, only  <dig> of  <dig>  worms would incur that particular duplication in each generation and the expected frequency of a cnv containing a particular gene would reach 2 % by mutational input alone after  <dig> generations. moreover, the spontaneous rate of duplication loss can be higher than the rate of origin of duplications and if we take the duplication loss rate into account, the rate of increase of a particular duplication in a population would be even slower and reach equilibrium rather than going to fixation or near fixation. therefore, the rate of origin of cnvs alone cannot explain the observed increase in frequencies of cnvs in these populations.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that gene copy-number changes can be a common class of adaptive genetic change to novel challenges in multicellular eukaryotes. although the nature of the benefit that the cnvs provide in our experiments is still unknown, we note that these changes can arise frequently and sweep rapidly through populations. some of these copy-number changes may be compensatory, serving to ameliorate the negative fitness consequences of deleterious mutations accrued during the mutation accumulation phase of the experiment. however, we note that many of these copy-number changes in our experimental populations may represent adaptations to the experimental laboratory conditions for the following reasons:  the presence of copy-number changes in control populations subjected to population expansion  without having undergone a previous fitness decline during mutation accumulation,  convergent copy-number changes shared among adaptive recovery and control populations, and  convergent copy-number changes in adaptive recovery populations descended from independent mutation accumulation lines. these results demonstrate the great potential that gene copy-number changes have for both adaptation per se as well as the potential for adaptive duplications as raw material for novel genes.
