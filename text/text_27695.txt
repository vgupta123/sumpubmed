BACKGROUND
synthetic protein biosensors are typically designed by fusing a target-binding domain to an easily assayed reporter protein. the ligand-binding domain is often derived from a specific receptor protein. most biosensors are complementation systems where enzyme or fluorophore activity is reconstituted from non-functional domains secondary to receptor dimerization or conformational changes upon ligand binding  <cit> . however, the repertoires of both, well characterized ligand-binding and reporter domains that are suitable for the design of complementation systems are rather small. a modular system that allows arbitrary combination of ligand-binding and reporter domains would thus be most desirable. there are a few examples of properly constructed receptor-enzyme chimeras which allow for the transduction of ligand-induced conformational changes within the receptor to the reporter protein and allosteric modulation of its properties  <cit> . coupling of ligand-induced conformational changes to reporter protein function appears to be the general bottleneck in designing such biosensors.

among the different families of transmembrane receptors, g protein-coupled receptors  form the largest receptor superfamily comprising over  <dig> members within several vertebrate genomes  <cit> . signals as multiform as light, small molecules including ions, amines, amino acids, peptides, lipids, sugars, as well as large proteins are recognized by receptors of this class  <cit> . upon agonist binding to the extracellular portion of gpcr, conformational changes of the transmembrane helix  bundle and intracellular loop  portions lead to g-protein activation  <cit> . conformational changes of the tmh bundle are not only observed after agonist binding but also after binding of inverse agonists that do not result in g-protein activation  <cit> . in addition, gpcr can be modified by site-directed mutagenesis to respond to biologically inert compounds instead of their native agonists  <cit> . the combination of these properties favours gpcr as ideal ligand-binding modules in hybrid biosensors.

in a number of studies, enzymes, such as luciferases, galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase, as well as fluorescent proteins  have been integrated into gpcr. in these gpcr fusion proteins, the enzyme or fluorescence activities were used as reporter assay to monitor intracellular receptor trafficking  <cit>  and, in fluorescence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer  approaches, to monitor gpcr-protein interactions  <cit> . recently, the activity of ion channels coupled to gpcr was modulated upon ligand binding, demonstrating that gpcr are suitable binding domains for biosensors  <cit> .

here, we report the allosteric modulation of enzyme activity upon ligand binding to a gpcr-enzyme chimera. using the m <dig> muscarinic acetylcholine receptor  and luciferase as model proteins, we provide a proof of concept that through rigid-body movement of the tmh bundle, extracellular signals may be transduced onto an enzyme that is integrated into the cytosolic portion of a gpcr, thus changing enzyme activity.

RESULTS
functional integration of luciferase into the m3r
to generate a biosensor in which enzyme activity is allosterically controlled by a binding domain of a gpcr, we replaced a 195-amino acid segment of the third icl  of m3r  with the sequence of luciferase from photinus pyralis . previous studies in mammalian expression systems have shown that in m3r, the removal of the central part of icl <dig> has no significant effect on receptor function  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  m3r-luci expressed in cos- <dig> cells was delivered to the cell surface and displayed both luciferase activity  and carbachol -induced inositol phosphate  formation . however, enzyme activity was not influenced by application of the agonist cch but we noted a significant reduction  in luciferase activity in the presence of the inverse agonist atropine . the effect of atropine was not found when luciferase was inserted into the second intracellular loop  or fused to a truncated m3r  and in several other controls )   .

to evaluate the functional properties of m3r-enzyme chimeras, luciferase activities, measured in the absence  and presence of the indicated ligands, were determined . basal activity is given as percentage of m3r-luci . activity in the presence of ligands is given as percentage of the activity of the individual constructs. data are presented as means ± s.e.m. of the indicated number of experiments, each carried out in triplicate. for measurement of gq/phospholipase c activation ip accumulation assays were performed as described under methods. basal ip values were determined in control -transfected cos- <dig> cells . data  are given as means ± s.e.m. fold over gfp-transfected ip values. cell surface expression was assayed with indirect cell surface elisa. specific optical density  readings  are given as a percentage of m3r-luci. the nonspecific od  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and the od value of m3r-luci was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . elisa data are given as means ± s.e.m. of three independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate.

significant reduction of the luciferase activity 

optimization of the m3r-luciferase fusion protein
next, we systematically deleted portions of icl <dig> flanking the enzyme  to improve coupling of atropine-induced conformational changes to enzyme activity. successive n-terminal shortening of icl <dig>  progressively reduced cell surface expression, ligand-induced ip formation and luciferase activity but atropine failed to modulate luciferase activity. likewise, the c-terminal part of icl <dig> was shortened . constructs # <dig> and # <dig> were properly delivered to the cell surface and displayed high luciferase activity. strikingly, both chimeras showed a significant reduction in enzyme activity up to ~40%  upon atropine binding. g-protein signalling was retained in construct # <dig> but abolished in construct # <dig>  presumably because the deleted c-terminal part of icl <dig> is involved in g-protein coupling  <cit> . the combination of n- and c-terminal shortening  was not advantageous.

we then tested whether n- or c-terminal truncation of the luciferase insert improved coupling to conformational changes of the receptor. only deletion of the very n-terminal two amino acid residues  had a significant effect on atropine-induced reduction of the enzyme activity . combination with icl <dig> shortening  did not further improve allosteric modulation of the enzyme activity by atropine. in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , further removal of the n terminus abolished enzyme activity completely  probably because of destruction of the functionally relevant n-terminal domain. the crystal structure of photinys pyralis luciferase demonstrates that n-terminal and c-terminal domains form the active site  <cit> . c-terminal truncation of the enzyme did not result in significantly reduced enzyme activity after atropine application, neither alone  nor in combination with icl <dig> truncation . preliminary studies with fusion proteins of other gpcr and reporter proteins indicate that integration and optimization is required for every individual biosensor .

allosteric modulation of luciferase activity by m3r blockers
finally, we investigated the specificity and potency of other m3r blockers in m3r-luci constructs. scopolamine and butylscopolamine, both are inverse agonists at m3r, were most efficient in reducing luciferase activity in construct # <dig> . ic <dig> values for atropine and scopolamine were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm, respectively . in agreement with functional studies at the wild-type m3r  <cit> , butylscopolamine was less potent in luciferase inhibition . this indicates an unchanged pharmacology of the ligand-binding domain within the m3r-luciferase fusion protein.

from the constructs tested, construct # <dig> met best the criteria of a biosensor, including nanomolar ligand sensitivity, high cell surface expression, and reduced g protein-coupling . in this construct, structural optimization was successfully used to enhance coupling of ligand-induced rigid body movement of the tmh to structural changes within the luciferase domain. as this leads to a reduction in luciferase activity, one can speculate that the underlying conformational change rearranges the orientation of the n- and c-terminal domains within the luciferase molecule that form its active centre. in addition, our data support previous findings  <cit>  that structural changes upon inverse agonist binding are different from those induced by agonists. following cch stimulation, fusion protein # <dig> still activated the gq/phospholipase c pathway but cch had no influence on luciferase activity . however, atropine reduced luciferase activity by 25% in this construct. it is interesting to note that insertion of luciferase, which itself is bigger than the receptor protein, into the cytoplasmic surface of the gpcr still allows for efficient g-protein coupling. this implicates a rather small interaction site between the receptor and the g protein.

CONCLUSIONS
by integration of luciferase into icl <dig> of a gpcr and successive optimization, we generated a fusion protein in which the enzyme activity is allosterically modulated by ligand binding to the gpcr in the nanomolar range. thus, we demonstrate that gpcr are suitable as modular ligand binding domains capable of transducing the signal through rigid-body movement of tmh onto an intracellularly integrated enzyme. artificial gpcr-enzyme chimeras may have applications beyond biosensing, for example, in ligand-dependent control of metabolic pathways and as molecular tools to study conformational changes in gpcr. our study may also encourage the generation of gpcr fusion proteins in which other proteins or protein domains such as fluorescent proteins and sh <dig> domains are allosterically regulated to modulate fluorescence properties and protein-protein interactions, respectively.
