BACKGROUND
dental caries is one of the most common infectious diseases of humans. the main causative agent is a group of streptococcal species collectively described as the mutans streptococci  <cit> . streptococcus mutans has been identified as the major etiological agent of the disease. unlike many other diseases, dental caries is as prevalent in the west as it is in developing countries, and therefore attracts significant interest from medical and dental authorities as well as pharmaceutical companies. the first step in the initiation of infection is the attachment of the bacterium to a specific receptor, and this is an ideal point for intervention. two groups of proteins from mutans streptococci represent primary candidates for a human caries vaccine: i) glucosyltransferase enzymes, which synthesize adhesive glycans and allow microbial accumulation, and ii) cell surface fibrillar proteins that mediate adherence to the salivary pellicle  <cit> . the bacterial adhesin sai/ii  <cit> , a surface-displayed protein with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda, plays an important role in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. antibodies recognizing this protein prevent colonization of the buccal cavity by the bacterium and could be developed as a vaccine against dental caries. the most suitable vaccination strategy would be passive immunization, in which monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof are applied to the tooth surface e.g. using toothpaste, mouthwash or chewing gum. this would make active immunization with the s. mutans adhesin unnecessary.

the murine monoclonal antibody guy's  <dig>  <cit>  which specifically recognizes the sai/ii protein of s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus has been used successfully to prevent s. mutans colonization and the development of dental caries in non-human primates  <cit> . the antibody also prevented bacterial colonization in human clinical trials  <cit> . however, like other murine antibodies, a major limitation in clinical applications may be the human anti-mouse antibody response , which can increase the rate of clearance and initiate allergic reactions  <cit> . the problems associated with murine antibodies can be overcome by replacing murine sequences with their human counterparts, e.g. by chimerization  <cit> , cdr grafting  <cit>  and guided selection using phage display technology  <cit> . furthermore, the use of antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies also removes some of the constant regions that may provoke an immune response.

there has been a growing interest in the use of single-chain fragment variable  antibodies, in which the variable regions of the heavy and light chains are combined in the same polypeptide chain . the advantages of such derivatives are that they can be expressed as single transgenes in various hosts, they fold spontaneously to adopt the correct tertiary structure, and their small size facilitates tissue penetration. the scfv has the heavy and light chain variable regions joined by a flexible peptide linker allowing the two domains to interact, forming a univalent antibody. alternatively, diabodies have the same structure but the two domains are joined by a shorter, less-flexible linker, forcing dimerization and the formation of divalent antibodies .

we have generated human derivatives of the murine guy's  <dig> antibody using a chain-shuffling approach based on human antibody variable gene phage-display libraries. we have taken the variable gene regions of the original guy's  <dig> monoclonal antibody and created human scfv and diabody derivatives by chain shuffling in human phage-display libraries. firstly, the heavy chain variable gene of the guy's  <dig> construct was introduced into a naïve human light chain phage display library to select human light chains that, in combination with the murine heavy chain, showed binding specificity for the sai/ii antigen. once such chimeric antibodies had been selected, the murine heavy chain gene was replaced with the human counterpart, by introducing the selected human light chain genes into a human heavy chain phage display library.

the resulting clones were expressed in bacteria and tested for specificity in elisas using both sai/ii antigen and whole s. mutans. the stepwise procedure for generating human antibody chains allows the advantages of scfv and diabody antibody fragments to be exploited without suffering the negative effects of non-human antibodies in a clinical setting. the human antibody fragments were expressed in bacteria as scfv and diabody derivatives and used to aggregate s. mutans in vitro. the diabodies were able to aggregate the bacteria and therefore have the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents to treat and/or prevent dental caries.

RESULTS
human recombinant scfv antibodies against sai/ii
human scfv antibody fragments based on the murine monoclonal antibody guy's  <dig> were constructed using two consecutive rounds of variable-domain shuffling and phage-library selection . first, a chimeric scfv was generated by amplifying the murine guy's  <dig> heavy chain variable region, and inserting it into a human light chain variable region phage display library. the resulting phage display library had a complexity of  <dig> ×  <dig>  single chain fv antibody fragments with appropriate binding activities were selected on purified, immobilized sai/ii antigen. three rounds of selection were carried out and unique candidate antibodies were identified by elisa . subsequent sequencing yielded five antibody fragments . sequencing of the human variable genes showed that two of the clones chimscfva <dig>  chimscfvb <dig> belonged to family vκ <dig>  clone chimscfva <dig> was homologous to hk <dig> and chimscfvb <dig> was homologous to the l <dig> germline gene family. chimscfva <dig> belonged to family vκ <dig> dpκ <dig>  chimscfva <dig> and chimscfvg <dig> belonged to family vλ <dig> dpl16) . inhibition elisa showed that the binding of all six chimeric scfvs to sai/ii could be inhibited by the murine monoclonal antibody guy's  <dig>  the binding of chimeric scfvs a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig> and c <dig> was inhibited by approximately 80%, suggesting that epitope recognition was maintained . the binding of the chimeric scfvs a <dig> and g <dig> was only inhibited by approximately 30%, suggesting that these antibodies recognized a different epitope.

the selected human vl genes were introduced into a human vh library  and a combinatorial library with a complexity of  <dig> ×  <dig> was established. three rounds of selection were carried out in solution using sai/ii antigen coupled to paramagnetic beads. eleven human scfvs were identified by elisa . subsequent sequence analysis identified three human scfvs: clones huscfv b <dig>  huscfv d <dig> and huscfv h <dig>  table  <dig> shows the amino acid sequences of the human scfv antibody fragments. the human vl domain in chimeric scfv a <dig>  was selected in combination with two different human variable heavy chains, giving human scfvs b <dig> and h <dig>  respectively. the vh domain of human scfv b <dig> is homologous to vh <dig> family dp <dig>  and the vh domain of human scfv h <dig> is homologous to vh <dig> family dp <dig>  the human vl domain in chimeric scfv b <dig>  was selected in combination with one human variable heavy chain giving the human scfv d <dig>  the vh domain of human scfv d <dig> is homologous to vh <dig> family dp <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the binding of the three human scfvs to the sai/ii antigen and the pathogenic bacterium s. mutans. inhibition elisa showed that the binding of all three human scfvs to sai/ii was inhibited by guy's  <dig>  suggesting that epitope recognition was maintained.

generation of human diabodies and agglutination of s. mutans
recombinant antibody fragments can be engineered to assemble into stable multimeric oligomers of high binding avidity and specificity  <cit> . a scfv molecule joined by a linker of 3– <dig> residues cannot fold into a functional fv domain and instead associates with a second scfv molecule to form a bivalent dimer . for the cross-linking of cell surface antigens, at least two binding domains are necessary. the diabody is the smallest bivalent antibody molecule that can fulfill this prerequisite. through reduced off-rates, which result from multiple binding to two target antigens and to rebinding when one fv dissociates, the diabody is suitable to facilitate specific agglutination of bacteria. we constructed human diabodies by isolating the variable heavy and light chain genes from human scfvs b <dig>  d <dig> and h <dig> and murine scfv guy's  <dig>  amplified by pcr  and inserting them in two consecutive steps into the vector phenixdia, containing a  <dig> amino acid residue linker. the integrity of the clones was confirmed by sequencing and the binding activity was demonstrated by elisa using both the sai/ii antigen and s. mutans cells . ma et al.  <cit>  reported that bivalent binding of the murine guy's  <dig> is required for protection against dental caries, since the f <dig> derivative was protective but not the monovalent fab fragment. s. mutans was aggregated in a dose dependent manner when grown in the presence of murine diabody guy's  <dig> and human diabody d <dig> .

discussion
antibodies recognizing and neutralizing the oral pathogen s. mutans provide a novel approach for the control and prevention of dental caries. a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the sai/ii surface adhesin of s. mutans was isolated by smith et al.  and has been expressed in plants as a secretory iga   <cit> . in ongoing phase ii clinical trials, this recombinant antibody has been shown to prevent recolonization of the mouth by s. mutans when coated onto the teeth and gums following eradication of the bacteria. the siga is probably the most appropriate format for the topical application of antibodies that inhibit the colonization of the tooth surface by s. mutans because this is the predominant form of antibody naturally found in the saliva. however, each siga comprises ten polypeptide chains of four different types making it difficult to produce on a large scale in conventional production systems. the more convenient diabody antibody derivatives, which can be expressed in large quantities in microbial culture systems, may be more suitable for the type of production scales that would be required for the routine control of dental caries using this strategy.

as a first step in this direction, we have taken the variable gene regions of the original guy's  <dig> monoclonal antibody and created human scfv and diabody derivatives by chain shuffling in human phage-display libraries. the heavy chain variable gene of the guy's  <dig> construct was introduced into a naïve human light chain phage display library to select human light chains that, in combination with the murine heavy chain, showed binding specificity for the sai/ii antigen. once such chimeric antibodies had been selected, the murine heavy chain gene was replaced with the human counterpart, by introducing the selected human light chain genes into a human heavy chain phage display library.

the resulting clones were expressed in bacteria and tested for specificity in elisas using both sai/ii antigen and whole s. mutans. the stepwise procedure for generating human antibody chains allows the advantages of scfv and diabody antibody fragments to be exploited without suffering the negative effects of non-human antibodies in a clinical setting. small scfv and diabody antibody fragments are easy to express in large quantities, they penetrate tissues easily and they lack the constant domains that promote often-unwanted and usually superfluous effector functions. however, where such antibodies are murine in origin, they can provoke an immune reaction in the human host, leading to rapid clearance and poor efficacy during long-term treatment. since dental caries tends to be chronic rather than acute, murine antibodies would be of little benefit to patients in the long term.

two drawbacks of scfvs compared to the ideal siga format are monovalency and instability. scfvs are monovalent because the heavy and light chains are joined by a flexible peptide linker, which allows the two domains to fold and interact with each other. we have addressed this problem by converting the scfv antibodies into diabodies, which is achieved by shortening the linking peptide and forcing the heavy and light chain variable domains to seek interaction partners as part of a dimer. as a consequence of this interaction, the diabody is bivalent like the parent immunoglobulin, and therefore has increased binding avidity. we showed that the bivalent binding of the diabody antibody constructs leads to agglutination of s. mutans.

the problem of decreased stability may be more difficult to address, because the efficacy of scfv and diabody molecules used to treat dental caries will depend largely on their persistence and effective concentration. secretory igas include a secretory component, which protects the antibody from proteolytic degradation in the saliva. one possible solution is to include this secretory component in any scfv or diabody format through the use of further gene fusion strategies. however, it is envisaged that antibodies for the prevention of dental caries will be administered in the form of toothpaste or mouthwash, or perhaps chewing gum, which will allow the treatment to be refreshed at regular intervals.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the humanization of a murine monoclonal antibody can be easily achieved using a chain-shuffling approach based on scfv antibody phage display libraries. the human antibody derivatives of the murine guy's  <dig> antibody can be expressed and isolated from bacteria, recognize sai/ii and s. mutans with great specificity, and can successfully aggregate s. mutans cells in the dimeric form in a dose dependent manor. these recombinant therapeutic proteins therefore represent the first step towards an inexpensive and convenient general treatment for dental caries.
