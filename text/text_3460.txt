BACKGROUND
the advent of next generation sequencing technologies with their low cost, high throughput and rapid speed has strongly influenced modern taxonomy. many taxonomists therefore turn towards integrating genome sequence analysis for formal proposals of new bacterial taxa or reclassification of old taxa . early classification methods were based solely on phenotypic characteristics, but the introduction of dna-dna hybridization   <cit>  and 16s ribosomal rna  gene phylogeny  <cit>  in taxonomy changed the species definition . however, due to the high level of conservation of the 16s rrna gene  <cit>  and the labour intensive and error prone nature of ddh experiments, there has been a constant demand for advanced methods at complete genome level. average nucleotide identity  , multi locus sequence analysis of conserved genes  <cit>  and phylogenetic analysis of core genomes  <cit>  are some of the suggested methods.

brachyspira species are ggram-negative, anaerobic but oxygen-tolerant spirochaetes that colonize the intestines of many mammals and birds  <cit> . it forms a clade within phylum spirochaetes that has undergone repeated taxonomic changes over the past few decades. initially the isolates colonizing pigs were allocated to genus treponema  <cit> , however they were later transferred to genus serpula and then serpulina  <cit> . in  <dig>  the genera serpulina and brachyspira were unified leading to the reclassification of serpulina species  <cit> . genus brachyspira now encompasses seven valid species: b. aalborgi, b. alvinipulli, b. hyodysenteriae, b. intermedia, b. innocens, b. murdochii and b. pilosicoli with b. aalborgi as a type species  <cit> . these species vary in terms of their host range and enteropathogenicity. brachyspira hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli are well known porcine pathogens  <cit> . furthermore, b. pilosicoli can cause gastrointestinal disease and egg-production losses in chickens  <cit> , and it can also colonize the human intestine leading to human intestinal spirochaetosis  <cit> . however, most cases in humans are associated with b. aalborgi, at least in industrialized countries  <cit> . moreover, b. alvinipulli and b. intermedia cause diarrhoea in chickens  <cit> . however, b. intermedia, is in general considered as a harmless commensal in pigs similar to b. innocens and b. murdochii  <cit> . there are several proposed species without current standing in nomenclature, including “b. suanatina”  <cit> .

some members of the genus brachyspira have low interspecies 16s rrna gene variability that does not always support species delineations, especially among the indole test-positive species b. hyodysenteriae, b, intermedia and b. suanatina that require additional methods for species confirmation  <cit> . the proposed new species b. suanatina was first isolated from pigs with dysentery-like disease in sweden and denmark, and the enteropathogenicity of strain an4859/ <dig> was confirmed by experimental challenge in pigs  <cit> . the phenotypic characterization based on the intensity of β-haemolysis and enzyme activities showed that these isolates were indistinguishable from b. hyodysenteriae, but detection by a species-specific pcr was unsuccessful  <cit> . based on 16s rrna and nadh oxidase  gene similarities, these brachyspira isolates from pigs were similar to some isolates from mallards  <cit>  and were distinct from all currently recognized brachyspira species, suggesting that they were members of a putatively unrecognized species. available data suggest that b. suanatina most likely is a rare genotype in both pigs and mallards, and it has so far only been isolated in northern europe. identification of b. suanatina currently relies on nox gene sequencing and/or nox-rflp  <cit> . the objective of the present study was to identify the taxonomical position of b. suanatina based on phenotypic characteristics and complete genome analyses. we have used a “taxono-genomics” approach that is based on the polyphasic combination of phenotypic and genomic characteristics  <cit> .

methods
bacterial cultures and growth conditions
type and reference strains b. hyodysenteriae b78t , b204r , b. intermedia pws/at , b. pilosicoli p43/6/78t , b. innocens b256t , b. murdochii 56-150t , b. alvinipulli c1t  and b. aalborgi 513at  were originally obtained from the american type culture collection  and stored in liquid nitrogen in the brachyspira strain collection of the national veterinary institute . brachyspira suanatina strains an4859/ <dig>  an1681:1/ <dig>  an2384/ <dig> and dk12570- <dig> from pigs, and an3949:2/ <dig> and an1418:2/ <dig> from mallards were isolated in sweden and denmark as previously described  <cit>  and stored in liquid nitrogen. the bacteria were retrieved from storage and were grown anaerobically  on fastidious anaerobe agar   plates with 10 % equine blood at 42 °c for 72 h and subcultured once for 48 h before use. cells for electron microscopy were harvested from broth cultures grown anaerobically on a shaker at 37 °c to mid log phase in brain heart infusion culture broth   with 10 % foetal calf serum   . faa plate cultures and broth culture were used to test the capability of all b. suanatina strains to grow at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 46 °c. for the generation of growth curves, broth cultures of b. suanatina strains an4859/ <dig> and an3949:2/ <dig> and b. hyodysenteriae b78t were prepared in triplicates in 10 ml bhis at  <dig> cells/ml and grown at 37 °c. population densities were determined every 4 h between  <dig> and 70 h of incubation by colony forming unit  counts obtained from serial dilutions on faa plates in duplicates and by spectrophotometry . comparisons were made against an in-house standard curve for b. hyodysenteriae b78t. purity was confirmed throughout the studies by phase contrast microscopy.

biochemical phenotype and substrate utilization
the api-zym test  was applied to all b. suanatina strains with b. hyodysenteriae b78t and pseudomonas aeruginosa  as control strains. bacterial cells were harvested from faa plates incubated at 42 °c for 3 days, suspended in 2 ml sterile ddh2o to a density of 5– <dig> mcfarland and the api-zym test was performed as described by the manufacturer. the test strips were incubated for 4 h in aerobic atmosphere.

brachyspira suanatina strains an4859/ <dig>  an3949:2/ <dig> and b. hyodysenteriae strain b78t were used for growth substrate utilization studies. all six b. suanatina strains were tested for growth in d-mannitol because of diverging results obtained with strains an4859/ <dig> and an3949:2/ <dig>  potential substrates were added at  <dig>  wt/v in heart infusion culture broth   and autoclaved or sterile filtered. the fcs concentration in the hi was selected at 7 %  from test runs at  <dig>   <dig> and 10 % fcs as described previously  <cit> . triplicate flasks with 10 ml hi and 7 % fcs culture broth  were used for each isolate and substrate, and were inoculated with  <dig> cells from a stock solution made from 48 h old faa cultures. cultures were incubated anaerobically at 37 °c on a shaking platform. glucose was used as positive control and his without added substrate as negative control. growth was determined spectrophotometrically  at  <dig>   <dig> and 9 days post inoculation for all cultures, and the purity, cell density and the condition of the cells were examined by phase contrast microscopy. compounds producing ≤ <dig>  od <dig> were not considered to be growth substrates. these cultures contained degenerated and/or non-motile cells as determined by phase contrast microscopy. cultures producing ≥ <dig>  od <dig> values and moderate to profuse growth of motile spirochaetes on at least one occasion were considered to be growth substrates. the following compounds were investigated: d-glucose, d-fructose, d-fucose, d-ribose, d-mannose, sucrose, lactate, d-xylose, d-trehalose, d-galactose, d-melobiose, d-cellobiose, l-arabinose, l-fucose, l-rhamnose, d-raffinose, d-galactosamine, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, mannitol, pyruvate, esculin, porcine gastric mucin, 50x mem amino acids, pectin, hyaluronic acid, glutathione, poly-galacturonic acid, cellulose, glycerol, succinate and glycogen.

electron microscopy
strain an4859/ <dig> was grown in bhis to mid-log phase, centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 3 min and washed twice in 1 ml  <dig>  m sodium phosphate buffer at ph  <dig> . the pellet was resuspended in  <dig>  ml each of sterile ddh2o and negatively stained with  <dig>  ml 2 % phosphotungistic acid at ph  <dig> . the cells were dropped on grids and examined. for scanning electron microscopy the cells were harvested and washed as described above, dropped on grids and coated with gold-palladium with standard procedures. the samples were examined with a jsm  <dig> scanning electron microscope . ten cells or more were examined to determine cell dimensions, the location of attachment sites of periplasmatic flagella and the number of flagella per cell.

dna-dna hybridization
the ddh of b. suanatina strain an4859/ <dig> was performed with all the seven recognized brachyspira species. cells were grown to mid-log phase in bhis, checked for purity and centrifuged at 4 °c at  <dig>  g followed by washing in pbs twice before mixing with 1:1 v/v iso-propanol . dna isolation and ddh were performed by dsmz gmbh deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen gmbh dna . dna was extracted using a french pressure cell  and was purified by chromatography on hydroxyapatite as described  <cit> . dna-dna hybridization was performed as previously described  <cit>  using a model cary  <dig> bio uv/vis-spectrophotometer equipped with a peltier-thermostatted 6x <dig> multicell changer and a temperature controller with in situ temperature probe .

dna isolation and complete genome sequencing
genomic dna for sequencing of strain an4859/ <dig> was obtained from 60 ml mid-log bhis cultures using the dneasy blood and tissue kit  as described by the manufacturer. the genome sequence was obtained using a combination of ion torrent and illumina miseq sequencing techniques performed at uppsala genome centre . single end reads were generated with the read size 300 bp on the ion torrent platform and paired end reads were generated using the illumina misseq platform producing reads of 300 bp. genomic sequences of available strains of currently valid brachyspira species and two strains of the proposed species “b. hampsonii” were obtained from genbank . strain names and accession numbers are provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  draft genome scaffolds for b. aalborgi were downloaded from the metahit website .

genome assembly and average nucleotide identity
single end reads generated by the ion torrent platform were assembled using the roche gs assembler. the resulting contigs were oriented using the b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> genome as a reference and joining was performed manually. reads obtained from illumina miseq paired end sequencing were assembled using mira version  <dig>  <cit> . before performing the assembly, the reads were trimmed and filtered based on quality, using prinseq  <cit>  and further reduction in the coverage was performed using a custom perl script. scaffolds were obtained using sspace  <cit> . the scaffolds were aligned to ion torrent assembly using mauve  <cit>  to find possible overlaps. overlapping scaffolds were manually joined in consed  <cit> . a putative plasmid sequence was predicted by blasting the b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> plasmid’s  sequence  <cit>  against the b. suanatina contigs.

the average nucleotide identity  between b. suanatina and type strains of all the seven valid brachyspira species was calculated using jspecies v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using blast  and mummer  algorithms with default parameters.

genome annotation and core genome analysis
b. suanatina scaffolds were annotated using the gendb platform  <cit> . predictions made by the gendb pipeline were also manually reviewed and curated. prophages were predicted using phast  <cit>  and by manual curation in the annotated genome. clusters of orthologous group  categories were assigned to genes by performing blast search against the cog database  using the threshold of > =30 % amino acid identity and e-value < =  <dig> . in order to obtain annotations based on the latest versions of search databases, all the genomes used in the analysis were also annotated with gendb. comparative analysis of the b. suanatina genome with other brachyspira genomes including pan and core genome calculations was performed using the edgar software framework for prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . whole genome alignment of b. suanatina with the complete genomes of b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. intermedia pws/at was performed using the artemis comparison tool . phylogenetic analysis based on core genomes of all brachyspira species including b. suanatina was also performed as a part of the edgar comparative analysis. for phylogenetic analysis, multiple sequence alignments of amino acid sequences of the core genome were obtained in muscle  <cit> , unaligned blocks were removed using gblocks  <cit>  and a phylogenetic tree of concatenated alignment was generated in phylip using the neighbour joining method. bootstrap analysis was performed on the tree using  <dig>  replicates.

phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes
for phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes,  <dig> protein coding genes that are universally conserved among bacteria  <cit>  were selected . nucleotide sequences of these genes for b. hyodysenteriae b78t, b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig>  b. intermedia pws/at, b. murdochii 56-150t, b. pilosicoli 95/ <dig>  b. pilosicoli b <dig>  b. pilosicoli wesb, b. pilosicoli p43/6/78t, treponema denticola at and borrelia burgdorferi b31t were obtained from the ncbi gene database . nucleotide sequences for b. aalborgi 513at, b. alvinipulli c1t, b. innocens b256t, “b. hampsonii”  <dig>  “b. hampsonii”  <dig> and b. suanatina an4859/ <dig> were predicted by performing homology searches against their gene sequences with b. hyodysenteriae strain wa1’s genes as reference. sequences were aligned using muscle  <cit>  and conserved blocks were obtained using gblocks  <cit> . genes with < 50 % alignment conservation were removed leaving  <dig> genes. phylogenetic inference using the concatenated alignment of those  <dig> genes was drawn using the maximum likelihood method   <cit>  with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the general time reversible   <cit>  model with discrete gamma distribution allowing some proportion of invariable sites  as predicted by jmodeltest  <cit>  was used to model the evolutionary rates among sites. phylogenetic analysis was performed in mega <dig>  an evolutionary analysis tool  <cit> .

prophages and mobile genetic elements
the b. suanatina genome contained a 15 kb region similar to the core region of the prophage-like gene transfer agent  named vsh- <dig>  of b. hyodysenteriae . by comparing this region with the gta region of b. hyodysenteriae strain wa <dig>   <cit> , we found that all the late function genes were present in the same order in both strains. of the twelve orfs of unknown function described in b. hyodysenteriae wa1’s gta region, orfa, orfb, orfe, orff, orfg, orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> were conserved in b. suanatina, and orfc, orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> were not present in the b. suanatina genome. instead six other orfs of unknown function were found in the corresponding region in b. suanatina. two of them were also conserved in the vsh- <dig> regions of b. hyodysenteriae b78t  and b. intermedia pws/at . one of them was homologous to a gene encoding for sulfatase  outside the vsh- <dig> region in b. intermedia pws/at and three of them were unique to the b. suanatina genome. besides these six orfs, three additional orfs were present between hvp <dig> and hvp <dig>  two of them were also present in the vsh- <dig> region of b. intermedia encoding for hypothetical proteins and one of them was unique to b. suanatina. another additional orf was present between hvp <dig> and lys gene in the b. suanatina genome and was homologous to hvp <dig> gene in vsh- <dig> region of b. intermedia pws/at.

a putative bacteriophage region, bsp was predicted in the b. suanatina genome, which has not been described in genomes of b. hyodysenteriae strain wa <dig> or b. intermedia strain pws/at. analysis revealed that bsp was present approximately 33 kb upstream to the vsh- <dig> region. the bsp region spanned over a  <dig>  kb sequence length and consisted of  <dig> cdss  including one vsh- <dig> related gene. the bsp region was not present in the complete genome of b. hyodysenteriae strain wa <dig> genome, but a homologous bacteriophage region was found in scaffold number  <dig> of the b. hyodysenteriae b78t assembly  and consisted of  <dig> cdss . a bacteriophage region almost identical to bsp was found in the b. pilosicoli p43/6/78t genome  spanning over 39 kb sequence and it contained  <dig> cdss  including one vsh- <dig> related gene. the organization of genes in bsp and its comparison with identical regions in b. hyodysenteriae b78t and b. pilosicoli p43/6/78t is shown in fig.  <dig>  further analysis revealed that a significant portion of the bsp region was conserved and had been previously reported as pp <dig>  pp <dig> and pp <dig>  in b. pilosicoli 95/ <dig>  b. pilosicoli strains b <dig> and b. pilosicoli wesb respectively  <cit> , and pm <dig>  pm <dig> and pm <dig> in b. murdochii strain 56-150t  <cit> . some of the bsp genes were also found in genomes of b. innocens b256t and b. alvinipulli c1t scattered in the genome either as single genes or in small clusters of phage related genes. these include arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_347-arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_462-arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_469-arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_ <dig>  arqi01_ <dig> in the b. innocens genome  and jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_  <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig> – jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig>  jadf01_ <dig> in the b. alvinipulli genome . only two genes of bsp shared homology with b. intermedia strain pws/at genes. these were: bint_ <dig> encoding hypothetical protein of b. intermedia phage and bint_ <dig> encoding putative integrase in b. intermedia. a part from these bacteriophage regions, some phage related genes and mobile genetic elements were also found in the b. suanatina genome including putative integrases, terminases, tail protein, portal protein that were not found in b. hyodysenteriae genome except for the two reported phage related genes bhwa_ <dig> and bhwa_ <dig>  bacteriophage regions of b. intermedia pws/at  <cit>  were not found in the b. suanatina genome except one gene  that encodes for a hypothetical membrane spanning protein, and is also conserved in b. hyodysenteriae strains wa <dig> and b78t.fig.  <dig> bacteriophage region comparison: comparison of the organization of the bacteriophage region bsp in b. suanatina an4859/ <dig> with the homologous bacteriophage regions in b. pilosicoli p43/6/78t and b. hyodysenteriae b78t genomes



gene content and synteny conservation
the pan genome of b. suanatina an4859/ <dig>  b. hyodysenteriae b78t, b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. intermedia pws/at consisted of  <dig>  genes. among them  <dig>  genes were present in all four strains,  <dig>  genes were shared between b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. suanatina,  <dig>  genes were shared between b. hyodysenteriae b78t and b. suanatina, and  <dig>  genes were shared between b. intermedia and b. suanatina . the remaining genes had their highest similarities with other brachyspira species. there were  <dig> genes in b. suanatina that were not present in any of the other brachyspira species, most of them consisted of hypothetical proteins and some had matches in clostridium spp. and bacillus spp.fig.  <dig> global gene conservation and comparison of functional classification of genes: the figure shows the number of genes and their classification in different cog categories from b. suanatina an4859/ <dig>  b. hyodysenteriae b78t, b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. intermedia pws/at  venn diagram  the bar chart shows the distribution of genes in different functional categories. genes were assigned to different categories using blastp against the cog database



by comparing the functional distribution of genes in different cog categories, the four strains b. suanatina an4859/ <dig>  b. hyodysenteriae b78t, b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. intermedia pws/at contained similar numbers of genes for particular functions  .

in contrast to gene content, gene synteny was highly conserved between b. hyodysenteriae and b. suanatina with only two major genomic rearrangement events that were found in b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. suanatina. some insertions were also found in the b. suanatina genome, when compared with b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig>  comprising mainly of genes encoding for unknown proteins, bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements. in b. intermedia and b. suanatina, there was a low level of conservation of synteny as compared to the gene content. the alignment of genomic sequences for two isolates of b. suanatina and b. intermedia pws/at using act identified extensive genomic rearrangements, including at least eight major inversions .

phylogenetic inference based on the core genome and housekeeping genes
in order to infer the evolutionary relationship of b. suanatina with other brachyspira species, phylogenetic analysis was performed on the amino acid sequences of core genomes and nucleotide sequences of housekeeping genes. in total  <dig>  genes were found conserved in all brachyspira species and their phylogenetic tree exhibited a close relationship between b. suanatina and b. intermedia whereas b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. hyodysenteriae b78t formed a distinct clade. the phylogenetic tree is shown in fig.  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> housekeeping genes also showed a highly similar tree topology to the core genome analysis and confirmed a clear distinction between b. hyodysenteriae and b. suanatina. the confidence level for the tree topology using  <dig> bootstrap replicates ranged from 60 % to 100 % .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of core genome: radial unrooted phylogenetic representation based on concatenated amino acid sequences of  <dig>  core genes of available genomes of genus brachyspira and b. suanatina strain an4859/ <dig>  the clade containing b. hyodysenteriae, b. intermedia and b. suanatina strains are shown in bold. the tree was constructed using the neighbour joining method. numbers above the branches represent support values  obtained from  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site

using the threshold value of 70 % dna-dna similarity for the delineation of bacterial species, as recommended by the ad hoc committee  <cit> , b. suanatina strain an4859/ <dig> does not belong to any of the currently recognized seven brachyspira spp. the highest observed % dna-dna similarities  were to the type strains of b. hyodysenteriae and b. intermedia. our finding was further confirmed by the ani values, which are considered to correspond with the % ddh values  <cit> . since the degree of robustness of anim is higher compared to anib for genomes having >60 % ddh values  <cit>  we calculated the ani values using both algorithms and the values obtained from them are in agreement to each other. furthermore, the evolutionary history inferred from analysis of the 16s rrna gene  <cit> , housekeeping genes and the core genome  suggests a common ancestor of the three related strains b78t, an4859/ <dig>  and pws/at, which each represent indole test-positive phenotypes of b. hyodysenteriae, b. suanatina and b. intermedia, respectively. high bootstrap values supported the phylogram based on housekeeping genes and the assertion that b. suanatina and b. intermedia make a separate clade that is distinct from the clade formed by b. hyodysenteriae strains. interestingly, the phenotypes of b. hyodysenteriae, b. suanatina and b. intermedia were very similar, with the strong β-haemolysis of the two former being strongly positive vs. the weak β-haemolysis in b. intermedia. notably, in this study, no consistent diagnostic phenotypic feature was found to differentiate b. suanatina from b. hyodysenteriae. the strains of b. suanatina in this study showed varying capabilities of using d-mannitol as growth substrate, whereas strain b78t could not. even though this phenotype could be further investigated it would not qualify as a reliable diagnostic feature.

interestingly, among the three strains, the type strain of b. intermedia pws/at seems to have undergone the highest number of changes since its divergence from the common ancestor based on the housekeeping genes phylogram. when comparing the conservation of gene synteny of b. suanatina with b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. intermedia pws/at, very low conservation was found between b. suanatina and b. intermedia as compared to b. suanatina and b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig>  these results also point to the high level of genomic rearrangements that have taken place in the genome of b. intermedia after these species diverged. previous reports based on multi locus sequence typing have suggested that b. intermedia is a genetically diverse species that may possibly consist of several species  <cit> . the same applies when strongly β-haemolytic indole-test positive isolates, to which b. hyodysenteriae and b. suanatina and other isolates of unknown species affiliation, are investigated  <cit> . clearly, this group of brachyspira isolates needs more detailed genomic and phenotypic study to elucidate evolutionary and taxonomic relationships.

general genomic features including the distribution of genes in similar functional classes in b. suanatina, b. hyodysenteriae and b. intermedia support the fact that they are highly similar species. however the genome size of b. hyodysenteriae is smaller as compared to b. suanatina and b. intermedia. speculatively, the reason for the smaller genome size could be that b. hyodysenteriae has adapted to the rich environment of porcine intestinal tissues through reductive evolution. reductive evolution is a process of reduction in genome size of a host associated bacterium by the loss of genes rendered non-essential  <cit> . the presence of intact bacteriophage region bsp in b. suanatina and its conservation in other brachyspira genomes including b. hyodysenteriae b78t while absence in b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> and b. intermedia pws/at also suggests the loss of this prophage in two later species due to the reductive evolution. events of horizontal gene transfer  are also evident in the genome of b. suanatina when examining the genes that had no homology in the genomes of brachyspira species with other bacteria. these include the presence of some genes that had their highest similarities in clostridium spp. and bacillus spp. both these species are also inhabitants of the large intestine where the possible exchange of genetic material with b. suanatina could have taken place. events of reductive evolution and hgt in the genomes of brachyspira species have been described earlier  <cit> .

the unusual phage-like gene transfer agent vsh- <dig> produced by b. hyodysenteriae is likely involved in natural gene transfer and recombination within different strains of the species  <cit> . it spans over a  <dig>  kb region of the genome of b. hyodysenteriae b204r and contains all the late function genes  <cit> . the region containing genes homologous to vsh- <dig> has also been identified in the genomes of different strains of b. hyodysenteriae, b. intermedia, b. pilosicoli and b. murdochii  <cit> . a region similar to vsh- <dig> was also found in the genome of b. suanatina in this study. although it is not clear if this gta in b. suanatina strain an4859/ <dig> is functional, the conservation of the late function genes and the presence of unknown genes in the gta region suggest functional capabilities.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the importance of integrating genomic data into the classification of different bacterial species. based on genomic characteristics we conclude that b. suanatina does not belong to any of the currently validated seven brachyspira species. the use of genomic data from more than one strain of b. suanatina species of the strain will facilitate future comparative genomic studies.
