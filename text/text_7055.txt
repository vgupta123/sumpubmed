BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are dna fragments that can move between genomic locations using a cut and paste mechanism , or a copy and paste mechanism via an rna intermediate . transposition can result in alterations of gene expression and diversification between individuals, populations and species. tes are commonly activated upon stresses that include tissue culture, wounding, microbial elicitors and pathogen attack . polyploidization  also mobilizes transposable elements, resulting in genome restructuring, and genetic and epigenetic effects on gene activity . selective breeding can also affect te activity. for example, in vegetatively propagated grape clones, te insertional polymorphisms constitute the largest class of mutations  <cit> . genetic diversity associated with te polymorphisms has been commonly explored in plant varieties and species such as pepper and tomato  <cit> , barley  <cit> , strawberry  <cit> , coffee  <cit> , blue agave  <cit>  and cashew  <cit> .

we previously showed that more than 20% of the flax  genome is made of tes  <cit> . the main group represented in the genome are ltr  retrotransposons, from which the ty1-copia elements are the most abundant. ty1-copia have five main domains encoding proteins required for the retrotransposition cycle: group-specific antigen , protease , integrase , reverse transcriptase  and ribonuclease h . because of their retrotransposition mechanism, ltrs are identical at the time of te insertion  <cit> , and thus sequence variations in them can be used as a molecular clock of insertion. ltrs act as promoter sequences since they contain cis-acting elements that respond to different stress elicitors . ty1-copia elements can spread randomly throughout the genome and are more often associated with genes than ty3-gypsy elements  <cit> . therefore, ty1-copia elements can alter gene regulation , promote transduction events of one or more genes to other genomic locations , or result in epigenetic gene silencing  <cit> . additionally, they can also fall inside genes disrupting gene function or altering splice patterns .

numerous ty1-copia members have been recently inserted in flax, as inferred from their ltr similarity and gene domain conservation   <cit> . furthermore, ty1-copia elements have had increasing activity in the flax genome starting five million years ago  <cit> . these observations indicate that ty1-copia elements could generate polymorphisms among closely related flax cultivars.

flax is a valuable source of bioproducts derived from the seed  and stem fiber  <cit> . its breeding for either seed or fiber traits in diverse climates has resulted in diverse cultivars and an array of agrobotanic characteristics that have been artificially selected  <cit> . while flax grown for human consumption , is the same species as the flax grown mainly to manufacture linen, they represent two different flax types  and the products are usually obtained from cultivars  that have been bred to have mainly one of the two characteristics  <cit> . additionally, flax is a summer annual crop in temperate climates and is usually sown during spring, but winter cultivars have been bred that can be sown in the autumn in milder climates. flax is therefore an interesting system for studying the relationship of tes to continuous and divergent selection practices.

the current study aims to uncover the impact of specific ty1-copia retrotransposon families on diversification of flax cultivars. we measured the level of polymorphism among a set of flax cultivars, and analyzed their relationship using a te-based marker system. since te insertions within genes are more likely to interfere with gene function, we characterized the nature of target sequences of polymorphic insertions to find out if they were closely associated with genes, and measured the effect of retrotransposon insertion on transcript expression in selected genes.

several strategies have been devised to find te insertional polymorphisms . previously, inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism  was used to study flax cultivars and species  <cit> . here we used a type of transposon display , known as sequence-specific amplification polymorphism   <cit> , to evaluate ty1-copia retrotransposon insertions in  <dig> flax accessions of either oil or fiber types, and spring or winter types. in ssap, tes and flanking dna are preferentially amplified using a pcr primer that anneals to a sequence specific to a particular te family , and a second primer that anneals to an adaptor ligated to a restriction enzyme site. our study showed that families of flax ty1-copia tes have high levels of polymorphism between cultivars, indicating recent activity since organized breeding commenced in the last century. while the copy number of each family did not vary greatly between cultivars, some families of tes were consistently more abundant than others across multiple cultivars. analysis of sequence insertion sites demonstrated that many of these ty1-copia elements inserted within or in close proximity to genes. finally, we found one case where an insertion of a te in an exon of a laccase gene decreased gene expression in roots. our study demonstrates that tes from the ty1-copia group have been part of the diversification associated with breeding, and that they may play a role in modifying gene expression patterns in the flax genome, which can lead to diversified phenotypes.

RESULTS
comparison of te copy number between flax accessions
to compare the abundance of te families between flax cultivars, we designed reverse transcriptase  primers  from six selected ty1-copia elements representative of six retrotransposon families, and used quantitative pcr  to measure their abundance in  <dig> diverse flax accessions belonging to either oil or fiber, or spring and winter types . the retrotransposon families were selected because previous analysis showed them to have ltrs with high similarity and conserved protein domains  <cit> , suggesting the elements had been recently active, and may therefore be expected to be polymorphic between cultivars. families were named according to previously suggested conventions  as: rlc_lu <dig>  rlc_lu <dig>  rlc_lu <dig>  rlc_lu <dig>  rlc_lu <dig> and rlc_lu <dig>  from each family a representative sequence which showed conserved sites for primer design among family members was selected . four of the six representative sequences from the selected retrotransposon families had 100% similarity in their ltrs and two had ltrs over 99% similar, indicating insertion of these elements in the last  <dig>  years . similarly, we identified the five expected protein domains from ty1-copia elements in half of the representative sequences, and four domains in the other half .table  <dig> cultivars used for transposon display

quantitative pcr showed differences in te family abundances . when averaged across cultivars, family rlc_lu <dig> presented the lowest copy number per haploid genome , with families rlc_lu <dig>  rlc_lu <dig> and rlc_lu <dig> following with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies respectively. finally, family rlc_lu <dig> had  <dig>  copies per haploid genome, while family rlc_lu <dig> had the largest average copy number of all with  <dig>  copies. in order to validate these experimental findings, the copy number of each te family was also estimated for the sequenced cdc  bethune cultivar  by blast alignments of primer pairs used for quantitative pcr results. the expected copy number of tes in each family estimated by blast alignments, was supported by the quantitative pcr results, showing a correlation of  <dig> , and demonstrating the validity of the analysis. non-parametric tests supported a significant variation in copy number for each family between cultivars in all cases . moreover, adjusted p-values  for all pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between some accessions for all te families tested with the exception of family rlc_lu <dig> . no single cultivar or group of cultivars showed a clear expansion of all te families, but the statistical analysis demonstrated a variability that could be exploited through the use of ssaps.fig.  <dig> absolute quantification of ty1-copia retrotransposon families. the quantification was performed in  <dig> flax cultivars, based on amplification from their reverse transcriptase  domains. the log <dig> of molecule copy number  was calculated using an online tool  that accounts for plasmid+insert size. this value was used along ct to generate standard curves to calculate molecule copy numbers for rts, which were normalized to etif <dig> to find absolute copy number. families depicted are: a rlc_lu <dig>  b rlc_lu <dig>  c rlc_lu <dig>  d rlc_lu <dig>  e rlc_lu <dig>  f rlc_lu <dig>  error bars = standard deviation. numbers above represent significant differences of the respective cultivar to other cultivars  which are numbered as:  <dig>  adelie,  <dig>  aurore,  <dig>  belinka,  <dig>  bethune,  <dig>  blizzard,  <dig>  drakkar,  <dig>  evea,  <dig>  hermes,  <dig>  lutea,  <dig>  oleane,  <dig>  oliver,  <dig>  rdf,  <dig>  stormont cirrus.  <dig>  violin. the average copy number for all cultivars in each te family is also indicated




identification of polymorphic te insertions using ssap
having demonstrated significant variation in te copy number between flax accessions, we used ssap to identify individual insertions that were polymorphic between the accessions. we identified seven ltr primers that consistently amplified distinct bands from the same six ty1-copia families used for copy number quantification . two primers were used for family rlc_lu <dig> because they generated distinct patterns and resulted in additional polymorphisms. the seven primers were used on to amplify dna from each of the  <dig> flax accessions , to generate the ssap profiles . a total of  <dig> bands were scored, from which  <dig> were polymorphic . the primers with the lowest number of average bands were ltr-rlc_lu1-primer <dig> and ltr_rcl_lu1-primer <dig> ; however, they also showed the highest rate of polymorphism . conversely, ltr-rlc_lu6-primer <dig> produced the highest number of bands across cultivars, with an average of  <dig> , but showed the lowest rate of polymorphism . the number of expected tes from the bethune genomic sequence analysis  was also correlated  with the number of scored bands in the same cultivar , showing consistency between methods.table  <dig> ssap band scoring and polymorphic bands

no single band could distinguish all linseed-types from all fiber-types, or all winter-types from spring-types, however, the definition of a cultivar as either a winter-type or spring-type can sometimes be ambiguous depending on the breeding program from which it originated  <cit> . within the linseed-types, bethune and rdf  had the most ssap sequenced bands in common, followed by oliver and blizzard . bethune and rdf had  <dig> bands which were only present in those two accessions: band  <dig> , band  <dig> , band  <dig> , and band  <dig> . at the same time, oliver and blizzard had  <dig> bands that were exclusively in those two cultivars: band  <dig> , and band  <dig> .

in the case of the fiber-types, evea, drakkar, and hermes shared the most bands. a band derived from ltr-rlc_lu2-primer <dig>  was present in seven of the eight fiber-types tested and was absent from the linseed types ; the same was true for band  <dig> from ltr-rlc_lu28-primer <dig> but the band was also present in rdf and bethune . one more band from ltr-rlc_lu28-primer <dig> was common to eight fiber-types , although in this case, one linseed-type  also had the band. one single band was present only in all spring-fiber types , but this one was also present in lutea .

analysis of flax genomic sequences targeted by polymorphic insertions
from the  <dig> polymorphic bands detected using ssaps,  <dig> were successfully excised and sequenced. most of the failed sequencing occurred with the highest molecular weight bands, which were either difficult to re-amplify or did not otherwise produce high quality sequence. some of the resulting sequences were redundant, probably because the restriction enzyme used for the ssaps found cryptic sites in larger fragments; alternatively, different cultivars could have the same te insertion accumulating mutations that generate a new restriction site, resulting in bands with different electrophoretic mobility, but which represented the same insertion event. after filtering for residual redundancies, sequences where the restriction site fell inside or just besides a te, and sequences where no ltr could be identified,  <dig> unique insertion sites where found . each insertion was classified according to its ty1-copia family and was mapped to the genome assembly according to the annotation deposited in phytozome . of the  <dig> insertions,  <dig>  interrupted annotated exons,  <dig>  were in introns,  <dig>  were within 1 kb of a gene opening reading frame , and  <dig>  were characterized as intergenic . altogether, more than  <dig> % of the cloned te insertions mapped within genes, or within 1 kb of a gene. for insertions in introns, exons, or within 1 kb of the cds, the inferred transcription sense strand of the te and gene were the same in  <dig> cases. conversely, in  <dig> cases, the te and associated gene were transcribed from opposite strands .

to validate the results of the ssaps, we conducted genomic pcr assays of  <dig> selected insertions  on each of the  <dig> flax accessions. we designed from each te insertion site sequence  one specific primer complementary to the flanking genomic dna  and performed pcr with the corresponding ltr-rlc ssap primer . nineteen  of the validated insertions showed a perfect match or nearly perfect match to the polymorphisms initially assessed with ssaps, while the remaining bands had different levels of disagreement .

we used gene ontology  categories to classify the genes that were found to be associated with polymorphic te insertions. the genes represented  <dig> cellular components,  <dig> molecular functions, and  <dig> biological processes . nine genes where classified as responsive to stress, four in dna or rna metabolism, nine in cell organization and biogenesis, nine corresponded to protein metabolism, five were related to transcription, three to transport, five to development, six involved in signal transduction and one was related to electron transport or energy processes. none of the categories were enriched when the arabidopsis orthologs were compared to the background of all annotated genes using agrigo .

qrt-pcr analysis of selected genes with polymorphic te insertions
to assess effects of te insertions on gene expression, we selected four flax genes from additional file  <dig> that were expected to be constitutively expressed under normal conditions, so that any effects of te insertion on gene expression could be detected. in making this selection, we relied partly on flax rna-seq data of control plants from an experiment on the flax-fusarium interaction performed in our lab , and on comparisons to the presumptive arabidopsis orthologs of our flax genes, since extensive transcript expression data is available for arabidopsis . four flax genes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis: pyruvate carboxylase , a laccase-13-related gene , and two rabgap/tbc domain containing proteins . the two rabgap/tbc domain containing proteins had  <dig> % nucleotide identity, and bore the te insertions in different regions . additionally, in order to study potential positional effects of the te insertions, we selected genes harbouring tes in exons or introns and te-gene associations in sense or antisense orientation . primers were designed downstream the insertion following the theoretical gene transcription orientation . five flax accessions that were polymorphic for insertions in these four genes were selected to be assayed on three different tissues  by qrt-pcr: lutea , oleane ; stormont cirrus , and an insertion in a second rabgap/tbc domain containing protein of intron  <dig>  which was also present in bethune ; and oliver, which had no te insertions in any these four genes. the results of the qrt-pcr analysis showed several differences  in the relative expression of the genes tested . only the laccase gene harbouring a te insertion  displayed a significant decrease in root gene expression  compared to homologous laccase gene of the other four cultivars evaluated that did not bear the insertion . there was also a significant difference between the expression of lutea/oleane when compared with oliver/bethune, but the expression in stormont cirrus was lower than in any other of the four cultivars. the three other genes did not show decrease in gene expression in agreement with the accession containing the te insertion.fig.  <dig> diagrams of genes bearing ty1-copia te insertions. the location of the primers used to test for changes in gene expression is displayed. gene expression was tested in five flax cultivars , which were polymorphic for the insertions. the name of the te family is above each represented te. orientation of the genes and tes is as depicted after mapping using phytozome. genes are drawn according to scale while tes  are depicted only to show insertion positions

discussion
te activity and genomic copy number
quantitative pcr using six ty1-copia families in  <dig> flax cultivars demonstrated copy number variation between te families, but also within each family between cultivars. artificial selection through plant breeding involves subjecting plants to diverse stress conditions , and growing them under agricultural and laboratory practices which are not always common in natural environments. mobilization of tes has accompanied the processes of breeding, as evidenced by the level of inter-varietal polymorphisms found using different transposon-derived markers  <cit> .

a first clue that genomes diverge with respect to transposon history is a difference in abundance of specific tes. our approach to assess copy numbers of the selected te families in flax followed a previous report that quantified the highly abundant bare- <dig> retrotransposons from barley in several cultivars  <cit> . we found significant differences in copy numbers between cultivars for each te family examined and differences when testing for multiple comparisons in five out of six te families . one of the most extreme examples of genome diversification due to active tes in a plant genomes was demonstrated by amplifications of the mping mite  in different rice landraces, where the element was actively transposing and ranged from  <dig> to more than  <dig> copies  <cit> . while the differences in abundance of the ty1-copia families we tested in flax were not as large as reported for mping in rice, they were nevertheless, indicative of recent activity of these tes.

in general, the absolute copy numbers we reported , probably underestimate the actual abundance of the ty1-copia families, due to frequent recombination and high mutation rates expected among ltr elements  <cit> . this results in modification of binding sites for qpcr primers or loss of internal retrotransposon domains, with concomitant creation of solo ltrs , which would not be accounted for by our method, based on amplification of the internal rt gene. furthermore, the expected number of annealing sites from our blast analysis  is almost always lower than the calculated copy number by qpcr  in bethune . this is probably a result of unassembled genome regions which are yet to be reported in the database . nonetheless, the copy numbers we reported for each family for bethune , were positively correlated with the number of tes identified by blast alignment of primer binding sites to the bethune genome assembly , showing the validity of our approach. there was also a proportional high correlation between the tes counted by blast alignment and the number of ssap bands found for bethune . in this case the number of ssap bands for bethune , was generally lower than the number of expected hits , and calculated te copy numbers  in each family, because this transposon display technique is only efficient for insertions located close to a restrictions site, and thus only reveals a subset of all insertions.

the highest estimated copy numbers and ssap bands across all cultivars were found on family rlc_lu <dig> . interestingly, this family also had the lowest proportion of polymorphic bands , and most of its flanking sequences were not related to gene regions . an explanation for the insertion pattern and abundance of family rlc_lu <dig> could be related to a lower level of negative selection, since tes inserted in regions of low gene abundance, may not be as detrimental for the genome. likewise, a lower level of polymorphism reflects inactivity, and it is therefore likely that family rlc_lu <dig> expanded in the flax genome before breeding of these cultivars, and has been mostly quiescent since. in fact, this family’s representative sequence has the largest ltr divergence , supporting this hypothesis.

opposite to what happened with family rlc_lu <dig>  there are compelling clues that the lower copy number families from our study were active in the recent past as demonstrated by the differences in te copy numbers between cultivars , level of ssap polymorphism , their ltr similarity , and that they relate more closely to genes . this is in agreement with low copy number tes catalogued as being inserted closer to genes  <cit> , and also being more active in recent past than high-copy number tes in plants like maize  <cit> . analysis of the maize genome suggest that the transition from low copy to high copy number tes should be placed in the 10– <dig> copies range  <cit> , which is in agreement with the difference between rlc_lu <dig> and our low copy number families.

ssap markers associate with flax types
ssaps were performed with the same six families for which we measured te copy number. based on  <dig> polymorphic bands, we produced a ml tree, in which accessions showed associations reflecting the division between fiber and oil types, with the exception of violin, a fiber winter type that was closer to the oil winter types that to its other fiber winter partner  . violin is a cultivar that behaves in the field like a dual purpose  winter flax, and is genetically closer to an oil type, while adelie has characteristics of a spring fiber . this would explain the close relationship of violin to winter linseed types in the ml tree, as well as the close relationship of adelie to the fiber spring types. previously, the division of fiber and oil types was supported by molecular studies looking at genes closely linked to the distinct phenotypes of these groups. the sad <dig> gene, involved in fatty acid metabolism, was used to determine an ancestral state of domestication of oil over fiber flax  <cit> . additional candidate genes related to fiber development or oil metabolism that can distinguish between fiber and linseed varieties, were also found in a genetic diversity study by soto-cerda and collaborators  <cit> . the te markers found in our study are therefore a good source of molecular variation that can be linked to genes involved in the divergence of flax types .

analysis of te insertions and potential impact on genes
characterization of insertion sites from polymorphic bands of the ssaps in flax cultivars, evidenced a high percentage of association of tes to genes. polymorphic te insertions can result in genome divergence through genome restructuring, gene mutation and regulation changes , which at the same time depend on the te’s insertion site preference, and regulation of their transposition by host mechanisms . while the mechanisms for insertion site selection are still not completely understood, insertional bias is evident for certain te families. young copia-like retrotransposons have been shown to insert more randomly than gypsy-like elements in arabidopsis, and are associated with euchromatic gene-rich regions  <cit> . similarly, we previously found that in flax, recently inserted ty1-copia elements were non-randomly associated with gene regions and constituted the largest superfamily of tes in the flax genome  <cit> . our results here confirmed that numerous ty1-copia tes are biased towards insertion close to or inside genes. go  classification , however, showed no bias towards specific functional categories of genes.

td has been often used to find polymorphic markers to study intraspecific genetic diversity  <cit> , but these types of studies rarely characterize polymorphic insertion sites with detail at the sequence level. we successfully sequenced  <dig> non-redundant insertions in different genomic locations. analysis of these insertion sites showed some interesting genes that could be related to agronomic traits, and represent potential candidates for future studies. for example, band  <dig> from ltr-rlc_lu0-primer <dig> , was characterized as a te insertion on intron  <dig> of pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig>  this gene is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, and has been identified as potentially associated with divergent selection between flax types  <cit> . we also found a te insertion on exon  <dig> of a pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase  <dig> gene  for cultivars bethune and the associated mutant accession rdf . plr  <dig> is a key enzyme in flax lignan biosynthesis  <cit> ; lignans act as antioxidants, as well as having beneficial effects on human health  <cit> . another interesting gene annotated as a laccase-13-related, had a te insertion on exon  <dig>  that was present in six fiber cultivars. laccases catalyze the last step in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> , and downregulation of lignin biosynthetic genes  has been associated with the hypolignification of bast fibers, a desirable characteristic for easier harvesting  <cit> . another gene with a te insertion, was 1-aminocyclopropane-carboxylate synthase 2-related , which was previously identified as lu-acs <dig>   <cit> . acs enzymes are involved in ethylene synthesis, and a previous study of acs gene expression in flax roots showed that transcript abundance of acs <dig> did not change in response to treatment with auxin antagonists, although transcripts of four other acs genes did. whether or not this might be related to the te insertion is yet to be investigated. we also found a te overlapping with a wrky <dig> transcription factor . mutants of this gene in arabidopsis have delayed wilting upon infection with the bacterial pathogen ralstonia solanacearum, showing that the gene might be a negative regulator of defense response  <cit> .

our results showed that  <dig> % of insertions disrupt exons, or introns or are otherwise in close proximity to coding regions . fourteen  of the characterized insertions in our study disrupted exons. while the most common result of an exon disruption is loss of gene function, this loss can result in a desirable agronomic trait. as an example, glutinous rice is the product of a retrotransposon disrupting an exon of the granule-bound starch synthase gene  <cit> . we also found  <dig> tes mapped to introns. intron insertions can result in different patterns: an ltr-retrotransposon insertion in different introns of a mads-box transcription factor of different apple varieties causes transcript suppression leading to seedless fruits  <cit> , and waxy kernel phenotypes in maize result from alternative splicing patterns caused by retrotransposon insertions in introns of an amylose biosynthesis gene  <cit> . regulation of expression can also result from tes that do not disrupt the coding sequence; we found  <dig> insertions within 1 kb of genes. examples of the impact of extragenic insertions include: insertions of ltr retrotransposons adjacent to myb genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis resulting in skin color variation in grape cultivars  <cit> , and in the production of blood oranges  <cit> ; insertion of a retrotransposon in the 5′ utr region of a vernalization gene , which allows winter wheat to grow as a spring-type wheat  <cit> ; and an increase in disease resistance to rice blast due to an insertion of an ltr retrotransposon in the promoter of the pit resistance gene  <cit> .

we found a particular example of a te carrying an f-box domain protein between its two ltrs. this te  has a recognizable rnase h  domain near the 3′ ltr and therefore represents a functional retrotransposon that has acquired a gene. this gene capture and capacity to mobilize the gene is known as transduplication, and has been widely seen with over  <dig> pack-mules  in rice that have captured over  <dig> genes  <cit> . retrotransposons in rice and sorghum have also been shown to capture numerous genes  <cit> .

te impact on flax gene expression
a preliminary assay was performed to test the effects of flax tes on gene expression, using qrt-pcr on four genes with insertions in either exons or introns. only the laccase gene demonstrated a significant decreased transcript abundance in roots that correlated to the presence of the te insertion: the cultivar stormont cirrus harbouring a te insertion had lower relative transcript abundance than the other cultivars without the insertion . observation of the qrt-pcr bands on a gel , demonstrated that the expected band was present in all cultivars, which would mean that likely scenarios for repression would be: i) anti-sense gene transcripts generated from readout of the te inserted in opposite orientation of the gene , that could potentially be used for the generation of small rnas tagging the gene for inactivation via methylation  <cit> , or, ii) the generation of a different splice form, which conserves the exon tested by qrt-pcr, but has reduced transcript abundance as a consequence of the modification  <cit> . other statistical differences where found, but none of these were in agreement with the presence or absence of a te insertion. we believe these differences could be related to cultivar specific differential expression .

for the pyruvate carboxylase gene, we expected that the te insertion in exon  <dig> would result in transcript alterations for lutea but this was not the case. for both of the rabgap/tbc domain genes which had insertions on introns, no impact on gene expression was evidenced.

these results show no common mechanisms by which these insertions may alter gene expression. insertion on exons would be expected to be directly disruptive but only in one of two cases a change was noticed. opposite orientation of te-derived transcripts could create epigenetic-mediated gene silencing  <cit> , but this should depend on actual transcriptional activation of our tes which might not be happening under our conditions. and tes inserted in introns could change gene expression or splice forms, but this does not always happen, and alternate transcripts can be created from one single gene with an insertion  <cit> . finally, if the te insertion is present in just one allele of the gene, the te effects can be masked by the other allele functioning normally.

in future studies, stress conditions or treatments which upregulate genes with inserted tes might proof to be a better strategy to discern if gene expression levels are affected by the te, for two reasons: i) the stress can generate a higher response of the host gene that can be more distinct that a low constitutive expression if the te really alters gene expression, and ii) the stress may also upregulate the transcription of the te, increasing the chance of readout transcripts that can be used for the production of small rnas that can mediate silencing. these examinations should be coupled with experiments: i) to assess the production of small rnas and methylation state of the gene, and ii) revise if te insertions are homozygous and if different splice forms are produced from the host gene.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our findings, we can conclude that there have been recent active retrotransposition events since breeding started for the tested cultivars. the te markers found using ssaps were useful to separate the major flax types, and their level of polymorphism further showed that they have an impact on diversifying flax cultivars. while not all flax tes examined fall in gene-rich regions  <cit> , we now know that the transposition of most studied families here is biased towards these regions and their study constitutes a good source of novel mutations that can be used to find potential linkage to diversifying phenotypes, which is the basis for creating new cultivars. in fact, strong proof of te-mediated diversification exists in closely related species of arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  and in cultivars of rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . no matter what the adaptive fate of these insertions may be, the mobilization of tes among flax cultivars constitutes a powerful tool in diversity studies. however, understanding how these insertions influence genome restructuring and shape gene evolution requires studying related cultivars and species to determine what insertions may be under purifying selection and which ones are being positively selected as part of the normal functioning of the genome. the te insertions found here, in different gene regions and in different orientations, open the door to study their potential influence on gene regulation on a case by case basis.
