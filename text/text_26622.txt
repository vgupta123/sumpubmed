BACKGROUND
stable rna molecules frequently undergo post-transcriptional modifications. the majority of these modifications involve the addition of methyl groups. the most prevalent modifications found in ribosomal rna  molecules are the methylation of the ribose moiety at the 2'‐hydroxyl group  and the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine. in bacteria, 2'-o-methylation modifications are relatively rare and are introduced by dedicated site specific or region specific methyltransferases. in contrast, eukaryotes and archaea utilize ribonucleoprotein  complexes containing small rnas to identify targets for 2'-o-methylation. these srna molecules are called small nucleolar rnas  in eukaryotes and the archaeal homologs are c/d box sno-like rnas . they are characterized by four conserved sequence elements termed box c and c'  and box d and d' . these elements fold into a ubiquitous rna structural motif, the kink-turn  . the standard k-turn structure consists of a short stem often containing non-canonical base pairs that is capped with two sheared base pairs   <cit> . typically c/d box srnas contain two k-turn motifs, the first generated through the interaction of the c and d box sequences at the 5' and 3' end of the molecule and the second generated from the d' and c' box sequences located in the center of the molecule. the conserved c and d' boxes  flank short guide sequences typically  <dig> to  <dig> nts in length that are highly variable and frequently exhibit complementarity to sequences within rrna  <cit> . in addition, the guide regions of some c/d box srnas exhibit complementarity to different trna molecules, whereas other guide regions appear to lack complementarity to either rrna or trna  <cit> .

in archaea, two copies of the l7ae protein bind respectively to the c and d, and d' and c' box sequences and stabilize the k-turn structural motif. this is followed by the further addition of the proteins nop <dig> and the fibrillarin methyltransferase to complete assembly of the active complex. the guide regions of the srna base pair with complementary sequences in the target rna and mediate 2'-o-methylation to the nucleotide that is base paired with the guide five nts upstream from the start of the d or d' box sequences using s-adenosyl-methionine as methyl donor . the methyl group deposited at the 2'-oh moiety in the target rna favours a 3' endo-conformation of the ribose and blocks sugar-edge interactions. in addition, stability against hydrolysis by bases and nucleases is increased  <cit> . thus, it is plausible that organisms growing at elevated temperatures require more 2'-o-methylated rna nucleotides to support rna folding and stabilization  <cit> .

single-particle electron microscopy studies and the crystallization of archaeal c/d box srnp complexes with different srna compositions revealed structures that either contained two or four copies of l7ae, nop <dig> and fibrillarin  <cit> . recent nmr spectroscopy experiments verified the presence of dimeric srnp assemblies, each containing two c/d box srnas and four copies of each protein  <cit> . these studies revealed the potential for sequential methylation of target rnas by the same dimeric c/d box srna complex. thus, the presence of two guide sequences in each c/d box srna could have evolved to provide a regulatory mechanism for rrna folding.

previous studies along with our results indicate that c/d box srna genes and their transcripts are highly abundant in hyperthermophilic archaea  <cit> . initial studies to map methylation targets of archaeal c/d box srnas focused on small rnas that were co-immunoprecipitated with fibrillarin and nop <dig>  from sulfolobus acidocaldarius, which led to the identification of  <dig> different c/d box srnas and their targets  <cit> . physical methods were used to show extensive post-transcriptional modifications in helices 90– <dig> in domain v of the 23s rrna in both s. acidocaldarius and haloarcula marismortui  <cit> . the advent of rna-seq methodology has allowed for the global profiling of small rnas from archaeal model organisms and has revealed a plethora of experimentally verified c/d box srna sequences  <cit> . in this study, we utilized seven rna-seq datasets to deduce c/d box srna-guided 2'-o-methylation patterns of archaeal rrna molecules. this pan-archaeal analysis revealed methylation hotspots in functionally important rrna regions. furthermore, c/d box srnas were identified that are proposed to function as rna chaperones assisting rrna folding during ribosome assembly.

RESULTS
identification of c/d box srna genes
we utilized illumina rna-seq methodology to obtain a global overview of the production and maturation of small rna molecules for different archaeal species. we initially compiled these small rna profiles to investigate several unusual trna and crispr processing pathways  <cit>  but soon realized that c/d box srna genes were numerous in hyperthermophilic archaea and that their transcripts were highly abundant and easily detectable. therefore, we initiated a comprehensive comparison of the rna-seq datasets. we used these data sets to generate a pan-archaeal overview of c/d box srna-guided rrna methylation . this study used the small rna profiles generated from seven archaeal species, covering three different phyla and six different orders . included is nanoarchaeum equitans, a hyperthermophilic archaeon with a highly compacted genome of only 490 kb size which harbors a small set of only  <dig> c/d box srna genes under genome reduction constraints. six of the species are thermophilic, with optimal growth temperatures of approximately 75 °c and above. we identified all abundant srna molecules  in the rna-seq datasets. these sequences were manually searched for the presence of ga/ag k-turn motifs to define c and d boxes . the regions between annotated c/d' box motifs and c'/d box motifs represent potential guide regions that are used to direct the 2'-o-methylation activity of the c/d box srnp complex. methyl modification occurs at the nucleotide in rrna that forms a watson/crick base pair five nucleotides upstream from the start of the d' or d box sequences within the region of extended complementarity. this is the “n plus five rule”. we used this extended complementarity and the “n plus five rule” to produce an extensive list of predictions of the positions of methyl modifications within 16s and 23s rrnas for each of the seven species .table  <dig> list of the organisms analyzed in this study

distribution and conservation of predicted 2'-o-methylation sites in 16s and 23s rrna across archaeal species
to identify the distribution and conservation of sites of rrna methylation, we first generated alignments of the respective 16s and 23s rrna sequences from the seven divergent species of archaea . the  <dig> predicted positions of modification  from the seven species were mapped onto the universal alignment and then located on secondary structure maps of 16s and 23s rrna . there were  <dig> predicted modifications in 16s rrna that occur at  <dig> different positions and  <dig> predicted modifications in 23s rrna that occur at  <dig> different positions. in 16s and 23s rrna there are respectively  <dig> and  <dig> sites that are unique and modified in only a single species. in addition, there are  <dig> and  <dig> sites in the respective 16s and 23s rrna sequences that are modified in two or more of the species.fig.  <dig> distribution of 2′-o-ribose methylation sites in archaeal 23s rrna. predicted sites of srna directed 2′-o-ribose methylation  from seven archaeal species  were mapped onto the consensus secondary structure of the archaeal 23s rrna  <cit> . the multiple occurrences of methylation at a given nucleotide position is indicated by increasing dot size . the color of the dots  indicates increasing methylation frequency within a nine nucleotide window. the archaeal nucleotide alignment positions of sites of modification discussed in the context of 23s rrna structure-function are indicated

methylation sites in 23s rrna
the crystal structure of the h. marismortui large ribosomal subunit has been determined  <cit> . since the primary sequence and secondary structures of the 23s rrnas are highly conserved across the archaeal domain  <cit> , we mapped predicted archaeal 23s rrna 2'-o-methylation sites onto the archaeal consensus 23s rrna. in the secondary structure, six domains extend from a central core. we identified hotspots of conserved methylation within helices  <dig> and 35a in domain ii,  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> in domain iv, and  <dig> to  <dig> in domain v . these are located in regions within the ancient core of the ribosome with domain v in the center of the large ribosomal subunit structure. a high number of tertiary interactions occur between domain v and domains iv and ii. domain iii and a large part of domain i are less connected with other domains and therefore are believed to be later evolutionary additions  <cit> . they show a generally lower density of methylation targets. clustering of 2'-o-methylations in the functional important and evolutionary conserved regions suggests that these modifications contribute to the folding, structural stabilization, assembly and function of the 23s rrna within the large subunit of the ribosome.

the majority of hotspots  are located in close proximity to the catalytic peptidyl transferase center , where peptide bond formation and peptide release occurs  <cit> . all six thermophilic archaeal species displayed methylation of the 23s rrna at alignment position u/c <dig> at the base of helix  <dig> in domain v . this position is commonly pseudouridylated in eukaryotes, while in bacteria and chloroplasts, pseudouridylation occurs one nucleotide upstream  <cit> . helix  <dig> is part of the peptidyl transferase center and interacts with the cca-tail of the p-site trna  <cit> . the p-loop of helix  <dig> is also part of this ribosomal p-site. in e. coli, the 23s rrna nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> in helix  <dig> interact with the cca-tail of the peptidyl-trna in the ribosomal p-site; post-transcriptional modifications at these positions are reported for several organisms . in our data, we predict modification of position g <dig>  in three organisms.

in general, the concentration of methylation sites near the peptidyl transferase center in archaea resembles the pattern of posttranscriptional modification of nucleotides  in the 23s rrna of e. coli  <cit> . a maldi-ms analysis focusing on helices 90– <dig> in domain v of 23s rrnas from different bacterial and archaeal species, identified numerous sites of modification but few of the sites were conserved between the different organisms  <cit> . the a-loop in helix  <dig> contacts the conserved cca-end of aminoacyl-trna in the a-site of the ribosome and is a hotspot for methylation in all three domains of life  <cit> . this is a further example for the importance of modifications at rna-rna interaction sites. in our data set the first nucleotide of the a-loop  is predicted to be modified in five of the species and the fifth nucleotide in the loop  is predicted to be modified in two species. for s. acidocaldarius, our predicted sites of modification agree with the methylation sites reported previously  <cit> . in the mesophilic species methanococcus maripaludis only a few c/d box srnas exist and in this species the a-loop does not appear to contain any sites of guide directed methyl modification.

helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in domain iv are 2'-o-methylation hotspots but are not in direct proximity to the peptidyl transferase center. however, these helices are part of the interface between the large and the small ribosomal subunit  <cit> . the e. coli ribosome crystal structure revealed an interaction between a <dig> in 23s helix  <dig> and c <dig> and g <dig> in 16s helix  <dig>  conserved pseudouridylation sites were shown to exist in helix  <dig> and the loop region of helix 69; these modifications influence rna folding and are crucial for ribosome subunit association  <cit> . in hyperthermophilic archaea, there is a high density of predicted 2'-o-methylation sites in helix  <dig> around e. coli position a <dig> . in 16s helix  <dig> methylation predictions are relatively sparse ; nonetheless predictions occur at a/g <dig>  in two species  and at g <dig>  in the mesophilic species m. maripaludis.

most of the rna in the large subunit of the ribosome is protected and stabilized by the presence and binding of ribosomal proteins. the proteins often contain elongated termini that penetrate between rna helices, interacting with several rna domains to stabilize tertiary rna structure  <cit> . the exceptions to this, where no ribosomal proteins are found, are the 23s regions of rrna that forms the interface with the 30s subunit  and the peptidyl transferase center . our data indicate that these unprotected regions of 23s rrna contain a higher density of methyl modification and that this likely helps stabilize secondary and higher order structure associated with subunit interaction.

methylation sites in 16s rrna
next, we analyzed the locations of conserved methylation sites within the 16s rrna structure . the four domains of the 16s rrna are connected by a central core that is located in the neck region close to the functional decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit that is formed in the early stage of assembly  <cit> . this region containing helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  also exhibits the highest density of conserved 2'-o-methylation target site predictions. the methylated nucleotides in this region likely contribute to the stabilization of the decoding center as well as the tight association of the four domains.

helix  <dig>  monitors the correct codon-anticodon pairing and is the core of the decoding center in the small ribosome subunit  <cit> . the g <dig>  is intimately associated with the interaction of the a site trna anticodon with the mrna codon; site directed mutations at this position are lethal  <cit> . other mutations in this region affect translational fidelity and resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin.

in five of the seven species examined there are a total of  <dig> methylation predictions at  <dig> different positions within helix  <dig>  seven of the  <dig> sites are modified in only a single species whereas six of the sites are modified in two or more of the species. positions a <dig> and a <dig>  are predicted to be methylated, respectively, in three and four archaeal species. we predict that the high density of predicted modifications contributes to the folding, structural stabilization and translational fidelity function of this helix. it is interesting that there are no predicted modifications in this helix in either m. maripaludis  or in n. equitans .

c/d box srnas that target conserved methylation sites
our analysis indicates that about 17 % of the predicted sites of methylation in rrna are modified in more than one species and that the average number of species modifying at these multiple hit sites is just less than three. position u/c <dig> in our pan-archaeal alignment  is predicted to be modified in all six of the thermophilic archaeal species examined in this study . this means that each species contains a srna with a conserved guide region that exhibits complementarity to the 23s rrna regions surrounding position u/c <dig> . in tte sr <dig> the d box guide is responsible for directing modification to 23s u2880; the d' guide in this srna exhibits no significant complementarity to either 16s or 23s rrna. in sac the sr <dig> d box guide again directs methylation to 23s u2880; the d' guide exhibits significant complementarity to a nearby region but appears to be defective in methylation at position c <dig> because of a mismatch base pair at the predicted site of modification. the other four srnas are conventional double guide srnas: pca sr <dig> uses the d box guide to target methylation to position c <dig> and the d' guide to target methylation to c2864; mka sr <dig> uses the d' guide to target methylation to c <dig> and the d guide to target methylation to g2908; neq sr <dig> uses the d box guide to target methylation to u <dig> and the d' guide to target methylation to u2826; iho sr <dig> uses the d' guide to target methylation to c <dig> and the d guide to target methylation to c <dig> fig.  <dig> complexes between srna guides and targets at sites of conserved 2′-o-ribose methylation in rrna. a conserved methyl modification of position 23s rrna c/u <dig>  the complementarities between the d' and d guide regions of pca sr <dig>  tte sr <dig>  sac sr <dig>  mka sr <dig>  neq sr <dig> and iho sr <dig> with the 23s rrna region around position c/u <dig>  are illustrated with position  <dig> aligned in the middle and labelled in red. the srna sequences for each species are listed below the rrna sequences with the c and c' boxes outlined with blue and the d' and d box sequences outlined with green. the predicted positions of methyl modification are indicated by “me” in red within the rrna sequences. the d' guide of tte sr <dig> has no significant complementarity to rrna . the d' guide-target complementarity of sac sr <dig> exhibits a mismatch basepair at the predicted site of modification  and is likely not modified. b conserved methyl modifications at positions 16s a <dig> and g <dig>  the complementarities between the d' and d guide regions of tte sr <dig>  iho sr <dig>  pca sr <dig> and sac sr <dig> to the regions around 16s a <dig>  and g <dig>  are illustrated. these modification sites correspond to positions a <dig> and g <dig> in helix  <dig> of eco 16s rrna . the srna c and c', and d' and d boxes are outlined with blue and green respectively. the predicted sites of methyl modification are indicated by  in red. the sequence complementarity between the d guide of iho sr <dig> and the region of around 16s g <dig> is disrupted by three gu base pairs  which likely compromises methylation activity; this iho sr <dig> site was not considered to be a robust prediction in our analysis



a more clear-cut example of sequence conservation between srnas from different species is represented by four srnas  that use d' guides to direct modification to position 16s a <dig>   in helix  <dig> involved in mrna-trna decoding . the d guides of three of these srnas  exhibit significant complementarity to a second closely located site and are predicted to direct modification to position g <dig>  the d guide of iho sr <dig> has a related d guide that contains three gu base pairs that partially disrupts this complementarity and it is uncertain if the srna complex is able form a complementary helix around g <dig> 

there are numerous other examples of srnas from the various archaeal species that share a related guide sequence . the evolutionary origin of these related guide sequences is unclear. in the six srnas that target position 23s c/u <dig>  the shared guide is adjacent to the d box in four and adjacent to the d′ box in two cases . the other guides in the six srnas are unrelated in sequence. the second group of four srnas where both guides appear to target conserved sites is even more confounding . it is possible that the four srnas are either derived from a common ancestor or originated through sequence convergence. in either case there seems to be strong selection for the coupled interaction of the two guides with the 16s rrna sequences surrounding the g <dig> and a <dig> sites of modification. in the numerous other instances of modification in two or more species, many are likely the result of evolutionary convergence.

diversification of c/d box srna guides within species
we have noted especially within mka and iho, that there are frequently two or more srnas that are predicted to target modification to the same site in rrna . these instances are of interest since they provide clues relating to the origin, propagation and diversification of srna genes. there are a number of possible mechanisms that can give rise to the observed redundancy including  srna gene duplication,  recombination between srna genes,  insertional mobilization of guide regions  and/or  sequence convergence.table  <dig> list of c/d box srnas that target the same site within a species

the genomes of mka and iho contain a large number of srna genes  and within these species there are instances where two or three srnas are predicted to target methylation to the same position in rrna. in the other five species with fewer srna genes, there are no srnas that are predicted to target methylation to the same position



the mka sr <dig> and sr <dig> are derived from duplicate genes that share a modest degree of sequence similarity in the immediately adjacent flanking sequences . the two srnas use their d and d' guides to direct modification of positions c <dig> and g <dig> in 16s rrna. a third srna, mka sr <dig> has a d guide that is similar to the d' guides in sr <dig> and  <dig> and may be capable of directing modification to position 16s g <dig>  the d' guide of sr <dig> shows a low level of residual similarity to the sequence around 16s c <dig> but is highly unlikely to be active at this site. thus it seems that sr <dig> represents a more divergent duplication of the sr39/ <dig> family that has undergone a circular rearrangement resulting in a repositioning of the two guide sequences and a deterioration in the complementarity between the d' guide and the region surrounding the 16s c <dig> target. the most compelling modification predictions for sr <dig> are at 23s g <dig> and c <dig> . a number of other scenarios involving srna gene recombination or guide mobilization can also explain the shared features of these three srna genes.fig.  <dig> sequence conservation and divergence within orthologous srna genes. the notation for box sequences and predicted positions of rrna modification are described in the legend to fig.  <dig>  a the mka sr <dig> and sr <dig> srnas are derived from duplicate genes and exhibit a high degree of end-to-end sequence similarity. the sr <dig> has a d box guide that exhibits high similarity to the d' guides of sr39/ <dig> and a d' guide that exhibits only residual similarity to the d guide of sr39/ <dig>  the predicted d and d' target sites for sr <dig> are 23s g <dig> and c3169; in our analysis, 16s g <dig> was not considered a d guide-target for sr <dig> because it did not meet the prediction criteria. b the mka sr <dig> and  <dig> sequences are derived from duplicated genes. the 5' and 3' regions of the d guides are affected by indels that shift the site of modification between c <dig> and g <dig>  c the mka d' guide of sr <dig> and the d guide of sr <dig> are highly similar in sequence and are predicted to guide modification to 23s g <dig>  the d guide of sr <dig> and the d′ guide of sr <dig> are unrelated and predicted to guide modification to positions 23s a <dig> and g <dig> respectively



the mka sr <dig> and  <dig> also appear to be derived from a gene duplication . the d' guides in the two srnas are virtually identical and are predicted to guide modification to position 16s c <dig>  in contrast, the d guides contain a number of indels at the 5' and 3' ends of the guide regions that shift the predicted site of modification from 16s c <dig> for sr <dig> to g <dig> for sr <dig>  indels that occur at the 3' end of duplicate guides can explain the numerous instances where modifications are predicted at neighboring positions within 16s or 23s rrnas.

a more complex example of target redundancy occurs with mka sr <dig> and  <dig> where there is duplication and rearrangement of only one of the guide modules . as a consequence of these events the related d' guide of sr <dig> and the d guide of sr <dig> are predicted to target modification to position 23s g <dig>  the unrelated d guide of sr <dig> and the d' guide of sr <dig> are predicted to target modification to positions 23s a <dig> and g <dig> respectively. this example suggests that modules consisting of a guide sequence surrounded by c and d box sequences are fluid and can be either recombined or mobilized between two srna genes. after a gene duplication or rearrangement, processes generating nucleotide substitutions and indels in the guides can generate a substantial diversity for interactions involving srna guide sequences and rrna target sequences.

c/d box srnas as rna chaperones
there are two consequences of the interaction of double guide c/d box srnas with two closely positioned sequences within rrna. the first is the methylation of the 2'-o-ribose position in the rna backbone that contributes to added stability in secondary and tertiary structure. less apparent is the role that the dual interactions play in facilitating the localized folding events within the assembling ribosomal subunits. many of the more critical and functionally important regions of rrna are hotspots for guide-target interactions even though the exact positions of methyl modifications are not always conserved .

because of the obvious role of srna-rrna guide-target interactions in localized rrna folding, we wondered if such interactions might also occur at more distant locations to facilitate complex folding events. we therefore looked at srnas that exhibit complementarity to widely separated positions within the primary rrna sequences. we found a number of intriguing interactions . the most interesting of these occurs in n. equitans and involves the interactions of sr <dig> and sr <dig> with 16s rrna . the first interaction involves pairing of the d and d' guides of sr <dig> with the sequences around a <dig> and u <dig> that are located on opposite strands of what will become helix  <dig>  the second interaction involves similar pairing of the d and d' guides of sr <dig> with the rrna sequences around positions g <dig> and g <dig> that are located on opposite strands of what will become helix  <dig>  the sr <dig> interaction sequesters each of the strands of the basal helix that defines domain iii of 16s rrna. the second interaction sequesters the opposite strands of the nearby helix that defines a large subsection of domain iii. we suggest that these guide-target interactions play an important role in bringing the distantly separated 16s rrna sequences into close proximity and facilitating their formation into helices following the target methylation and release of the srnas. a number of other potential long-range guide-target interactions that may play an important role in ribosome subunit assembly have been identified . in addition, we suggest that the dimeric c/d box rnp complexes observed in nmr spectroscopy experiments  <cit>  may use their quadruple guides to target sites that are distant in the primary rrna sequence; these distant interactions could represent a complex and important mechanism for sequestering distant rrna sequences and bringing them into close proximity within the assembling ribosome in a manner analogous to what is predicted for neq sr <dig> and  <dig> .table  <dig> list of c/d box srnas that target distant sites that are close in secondary structure space

five species  have srnas that are predicted to target methylation to sites that are distant in the primary rrna sequence but close in the secondary structure. two types of interactions are observed. in the first, the d and d′ guides have single targets as exemplified by neq sr <dig>  in the second, one guide has a single target, whereas the second guide has two targets, one linked and one distant in the primary sequence but close in the secondary structure. an example of this is tte  <dig> where the d guide is predicted to modify position 16s a <dig> and the d′ guide is predicted to modify at the linked position c <dig> and the distant position c <dig>  in one instance, the iho sr <dig> interaction with the distant site at position 16s g <dig> contains a mismatch base pair at the site of methylation and is predicted not to be modified although the guide-target may well occur. the asterisk  indicates a mismatch base pair at the target site in the region of guide-target complementarity

CONCLUSIONS
the pan-archaeal analysis of experimentally verified c/d box srna molecules was used to deduce 2'-o-methylation patterns for archaeal rrna molecules. hot-spots for modifications were found to be located in core regions of the ribosome, at the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits and at sites of rna-rna interaction. these observations are in agreement with an increased need for 2'-o-methylated nucleotides in rrna regions that lack protein protection to stabilize these sequences at high temperatures. the analyses of guide sequences revealed the accelerated evolution of c/d box srna genes with instances of gene duplication, rearrangement and guide sequence diversification. moreover, many conserved target sites across the archaeal kingdom hint at the convergent evolution of the corresponding guide sequences. the presence of two guide sequences in each c/d box srna allows for the sequential methylation of two target sites. our analysis of guide-target interactions suggests that the two potential targets of an srna are often closely linked  and the simultaneous interactions likely play an important role in facilitation rrna folding events. similarly, we identified c/d box srnas with targets separated by more than  <dig> nts that are required to be brought in close proximity during rrna folding. these distant interactions provide further evidence for a potential rna chaperone function of c/d box srnas.

it should also be noted that rna-guided methylation adds to ribosome heterogeneity as the methylation of individual nucleotides is not always absolute. elevated growth temperatures could result in altered target recognition which would increase ribosome heterogeneity and represent another level of adaption to extreme growth conditions. future analysis of the methylation status of all individual rrna nucleotides and the abundance of various srnas under different physiological conditions will be necessary to evaluate the importance of site specific methylation and the degree of rrna heterogeneity.
