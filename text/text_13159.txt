BACKGROUND
describing the dynamic behavior of molecular interactions in a cell or cell compartment
by chemical reaction kinetics has become a standard approach in systems biology for
metabolic pathways as well as for regulatory networks. since qualitative knowledge about
these interactions is often available from experiments, literature or databases, which
can be represented as network graphs, several different graph-based approaches have been
developed to analyze the behavior of the networks. these methods operate solely on the
graphs without detailed knowledge of the kinetic rates. they show for example that
certain subnetwork structures are necessary to generate complex behavior such as
oscillations, hysteresis or multistationarity. thus, such behavior can be excluded for
relatively small and simple networks that lack these subnetworks. so far, most of these
approaches have the following limitations for practical use: first, they only allow to
make statements for relatively simple graph topologies, and second, they are often
restricted to very specific model classes such as metabolic networks of the form
x˙=sv
with stoichiometric matrix s and  flux vector
v  <cit>  or regulatory
networks whose jacobian matrices have constant signs on the off-diagonal elements
 <cit> . similar analysis methods that work for
more complex graph topologies or more general network model classes are rare. on the
other hand, it has been shown in various contexts that interrelated feedback structures
contribute to the robustness of intracellular regulation processes  <cit> . in most studies this is
demonstrated by analyzing a specific model via simulations with varying parameter
values, for example via monte carlo simulations. although the conclusions from these
studies are very helpful and valuable, it is not clear to which extend they can be
generalized to other network models. these results, which show the importance of
feedback in regulation processes, provide a further basis for the need of new methods
that can deal with interrelated feedback in dynamic network models in a more general
way. we expect that the more complex the graph topologies, the more does the
system’s behavior depend on the kinetic rate laws, and less can be concluded from
the structure alone. thus, these new methods can probably not be completely independent
of equations and parameters.

a new approach in this direction has been introduced in our previous work  <cit>  for a general class of regulatory network models. we
introduced the circuit-breaking algorithm , a method which operates on the
graph topology to construct a one-dimensional characteristic that inherits important
information about the behavior of the system. in particular, we demonstrated that the
zeros of this characteristic are related to the system’s fixed points.

in this paper we extend this work and show that the characteristic contains information
about stability of the fixed points and can furthermore be used to detect bifurcation
point candidates. the paper is structured as follows: we give a brief overview over our
network model class and the circuit-breaking algorithm and show how it works on a
network for cellular differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . based on these results, we investigate relations
between the stability of fixed points and the slope of the circuit-characteristic that
is constructed by the cba. it is shown that a negative slope at a zero of the
characteristic does generally not contain any information about the stability of the
respective fixed point, while a positive slope implies that the fixed point is unstable,
at least for certain graph topologies. we demonstrate results on biological network
models for tryptophan regulation in escherichia coli <cit>  and the repressilator model  <cit> .

RESULTS
the circuit-breaking algorithm
here we introduce the regulatory network model class and summarize the
concept of the cba. for details we refer to  <cit> . since the formal description of the algorithm is very
technical and needs a lot of indices, we will thereafter directly show how it works
on a concrete network example, from which we hope that it makes the general concept
easier understandable.

we consider regulatory networks models that are described by a system of first order
ordinary differential equations 

  x˙=f,x∈rn,f∈c <dig> 

with underlying interaction graph  g that illustrates the dependence structure of the variables, i.e. 

  ej→i∈e⇔∃x∈rnsuch that∂x˙i∂xj≠ <dig> 

and 

  ei→i∈e⇔∃x∈rnsuch that∂x˙i∂xi> <dig>  

trajectories of the system should be bounded, a biologically plausible assumption
which also implies that the system has at least one fixed point. it is sometimes
useful for the analysis to introduce sign-labels of edges in the i-graph if the
corresponding partial derivative is monotone, which means that the influence of a
component on another one is purely activating or purely inhibiting regardless of the
state of the system. contrary to many other methods, the cba does not rely on this
monotonicity assumption.

given a regulatory network model, i.e. a differential equation system
x˙=f
and the i-graph topology g, the cba consists of the
following steps:

 <dig>  find strongly connected components of g:the first step of
the cba is a partitioning of the vertex set v into strongly connected
components , i.e. the maximal strongly connected subgraphs, which we denote by
gk,
k= <dig> …,k. the new graph
gscc,
which is obtained by shrinking all vertices of a scc to one single vertex and drawing
an edge ei→jscc
between two vertices viscc
and vjscc
of this graph when there exist vertices vi∈vi
and vj∈vj
that are connected with an edge ei→j
in the original graph g, has a hierarchical topology
without any circuits. this fact is illustrated in figure  <dig> we
numerate the sccs according to this hierarchical order in the network. fixed point
coordinates of the system can iteratively be calculated for each scc, starting with
the scc on top and following the hierarchical structure downwards. in this scheme the
fixed point coordinates of the sccs upstream serve as constant input u for
subsequent sccs. an example for this concept of iterative fixed point calculation for
sccs is given in  <cit> . we denote these sets
of fixed points of scc k with input u by ufk.
for the sake of simplicity we skip the index u in the following, but bear in
mind that the fixed point set fkhas to be calculated for
each input u.

 <dig>  construct characteristics for each scc in dependence of input u and
calculate the fixed points from it’s zeros: the core of the cba is the
construction of a one-dimensional characteristic ck
for a scc
gk
for each input u. this is done in the following way: 

 find the set c of all elementary circuits and list them as
set of vertex subsets

 find a minimal circuit-covering vertex set v~
such that at least one element of each subset in c is contained in
v~
and set m=|v~|.
collect the rest of the vertices in the set v^.
relabel vertices such that v~={v <dig> …,vm}
and v^={vm+ <dig> …,v|vk|}.

 break all circuits by removing all edges that point to vertices of
v~.
mathematically, this is done by setting these variables to fixed input values
κ=,
i.e. xi=κi. the result
is an acyclic or hierarchical graph topology.

 the fixed point coordinates of variables in v^,
denoted by f={x¯p}p=m+ <dig> …,|vk|,
can be calculated in dependence of these inputs κ.

 the circuits are iteratively closed by releasing the vertices in
v~
one after another, starting backwards with vm. this
translates into shifting the respective vertex vi from
the set v~
to v^,
reducing the vector κby the same element, and solving the implicit
equation of the form 

  fi)= <dig> 

for xi to get the set x¯i
of fixed point coordinates of the variable xi in
dependence of the vector κ. the set f has to
be updated accordingly. equation  has to be solved numerically. for
i= <dig> …,mwe denote the expression on the left hand side of
equation  partial circuit-characteristic. the number of input variables
of these characteristics is reduced by one in each step, since κis
reduced by one element in each step. thus, when releasing the last vertex
v <dig> in v~,
f1):r→r is a
one-dimensional characteristic that is called the
circuit-characteristicc of the
respective scc. it’s zeros correspond to the fixed point coordinates of
variable x <dig>  denoted by {x¯1}.
if we leave the current scc and go to the next one, we refer to this characteristic
as ck.

 the corresponding fixed point coordinates of the other variables can
be calculated iteratively by inserting the values of the set {x¯1}
into the partial circuit-characteristics in reverse order. these coordinates are then
collected in the set f of fixed point coordinates of the scc k. if we leave
the scc k, we refer to this set as fk.
graph g and it’s partitioning into
strongly connected components . within a strongly connected
component, each pair of vertices is connected via a path. if each scc is
contracted to a single vertex, the resulting graph is circuit-free
  and thus has a
hierarchical order.

the structure of the cba is illustrated in figure  <dig> with a flow
chart.

done within a scc of the graph, yellow boxes describe the iterative closing of
the circuits within this scc by releasing vertices in the set

application of the cba to a model for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation
to motivate the subsequent investigations on the characteristics of regulatory
network models and it’s relation to fixed points and their stability, we
consider a network model for the cellular differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells
described in  <cit> : 

  x˙1=en−x1=r1−x1x˙2=5x11+x111+x34−x2=r2−x2x˙3=5x41+x411+x24−x3=r3−x3x˙4=em1+x24−x4=r4−x4x˙5=x1x41+x1x4+4x31+x311+x24−x5=r5−x5x˙6=x1x41+x1x4+4x21+x211+x34−x6=r6−x <dig> 

this model describes the interplay between the two lineage-specific counter-acting
suppressors gfi- <dig>  and egr 
during cellular differentiation for the neutrophil and macrophage cell fate choices,
respectively. these are activated by their transcription factors
c/ebpα and pu. <dig> ,
respectively. together, they regulate the expression of lineage-specific downstream
genes, which are not further specified in the model and denoted by mac
 and neut . the model was build
based on chemical reaction kinetics that describe interaction of the molecular
species. the cellular state is assumed to be directly correlated to the fixed point
concentrations of the transcription factors, as described further below. furthermore,
the model was non-dimensionalized after some simplifications by rescaling time and
protein concentrations. the two parameters that are left,
en and em, are the
rescaled synthesis rate of the transcription factor c/ebpα, which is
not regulated in the model, and the maximal rescaled synthesis rate of the
transcription factor pu. <dig> 
with bifurcation parameter μ=em and
condition en=em that was
created using xpppaut. for em= <dig> the system has a
globally stable fixed point at x= <dig>  the system undergoes a saddle-node
bifurcation at em∗≈ <dig> .
it has a globally stable fixed point for em<em∗
and two stable fixed points divided by an intermediate unstable one for
em>em∗.
it can also be seen that the stable fixed point branch that exists for all
emrepresents the neutrophil state, since the fixed
point coordinates of the neutrophil specific proteins
 increase
monotonically along this branch. the macrophage state is represented by the stable
fixed point branch that appears at em∗.

cell differentiation network ) described in  <cit>  with bifurcation parameter
μ=em. has been created with
additional file  <dig> 

now we use the cba to construct the characteristic of this system and compare this
with the information of the bifurcation diagram. as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the i-graph of system  consists of four strongly connected
components given by v1={x1},v2={x <dig> x <dig> x4},v3={x5}
and v4={x6}
with circuit sets c1=c3=c4=∅,c2={x <dig> x <dig> x3},{x <dig> x3},
and minimal circuit-covering vertex sets v~1=v~3=v~4=∅
and v~2={x2}.
cells. i-graph g of system . it
consists of four sccs, as indicated with the grey boxes, and
c2has two interrelated positive circuits.

we start with g <dig> 
which does not contain any circuits. thus, we just have to solve
x˙1=0
in system , which leads to the set f1=x¯11={r1}
of fixed points of g <dig>  the fixed point set
u=r1f2={x¯ <dig> x¯ <dig> x¯42}
of g <dig> is
calculated by breaking the two circuits at x <dig>  i.e. setting
x2=:κ <dig> 
inserting x¯4=r4
and x¯3=r3)
into x˙2
leads to the circuit-characteristic 

  u=r1c2=r2r <dig> r3κ <dig> r4−κ <dig>  

which can, by inserting the respective terms for the synthesis rates r, be
rewritten as 

  c2=5r11+r111+x¯3−κ <dig> 

with 

  x¯3=5x¯41+x¯411+4andx¯4=em1+ <dig>  

this characteristic is shown in figure  <dig> ,
along with the sets x¯i,
i= <dig> , <dig> , for parameter values
em={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> } .

the following properties of the system can be identified from these figures: 

 <dig>  the fixed point coordinates of all variables
x <dig> x <dig> x5and
x6behave monotonically with the input
κ <dig>  which represents the neutrophil state. the macrophage
specific proteins x <dig> x4and
x5decrease with increasing κ <dig> 
x6increases.

 <dig>  looking at the characteristics  for different
values em, it is monotonically decreasing for
em<em∗
, and thus has a single zero, which corresponds to the single fixed
point branch for em<em∗.
for the value em= <dig> , which is chosen here, we get the
fixed point x¯={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> },
as indicated in the graphs. this state represents an intermediate non-differentiated
progenitor cell state. the saddle-node bifurcation is represented by the second zero
of the characteristic that appears at em=em∗
. the respective fixed point set is
x¯1={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> }
and x¯2={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> }.finally,
the characteristic has three zeros for em>em∗
 and thus the system has three fixed points in this range.
for the chosen value em= <dig>  we can read off the fixed
point set x¯1={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> },
x¯2={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> }
and x¯3={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> }.
here, x¯1
represents the macrophage state, where egr and pu. <dig> are highly expressed, and
c/ebpαis low, x¯3
stands for the neutrophil state in which c/ebpαis dominant, and
x¯2
is an unstable intermediate state that separates the two basins of attraction.

 <dig> 

seeking for further parallels between the bifurcation diagram  and the characteristics in figure  <dig>  the question
arises if the characteristic also contains information about bifurcations and
stability of the fixed points. clearly, the parameters for which the characteristic
touches the x-axis without intersection are bifurcation value candidates.
furthermore, looking at this example, a self-evident guess would be to assume that
stability can be determined in the same way as for one-dimensional vector fields: the
fixed points are stable if the slope of the characteristic at the corresponding zero
κ∗ is negative, i.e. dc/dκκ=κ∗< <dig> 
and it is unstable if the slope is positive, i.e. dc/dκκ=κ∗> <dig> 
we will further investigate these assumptions in the following subsections. in order
to do so, we consider in the following strongly connected i-graphs, which allows to
neglect the indices u and k, such that indexing can be simplified.
the results are, however, easily transferable to arbitrary graphs, since construction
of the characteristic is done separately for each strongly connected component. we
will continue by denoting the characteristic simply with
c, where κ1∈r is the value
of the variable x <dig>  the one which is released lastly. we first
prove the following proposition, which relates the slope of the characteristic to the
determinant of the jacobian matrix jf of the
system:

proposition 1
  dcdκ1=df1dx1)     =  det jf)·det−1jfv∖{v1}f 

with f denoting the fixed point coordinates of
variables x <dig> …,x|v|in
dependence of x <dig>  and jfv∖{v1}
is the jacobian matrix of the subnetwork spanned by the vertices
v∖{v1}.

the proof is given in the methods section. note that proposition  <dig> holds for all
inputs κ <dig>  but we are here especially interested in the
zeros of the characteristic, i.e. the set of κ1∗
with c= <dig> 
and we will in the following subsection sometimes denote the corresponding fixed
point with x¯,
if appropriate.

instability of fixed points
from proposition  <dig> it follows that a positive slope dcdκ1κ1∗>0
implies that detjf))
and detjfv∖{v1}f
have the same signs. according to the hartman-grobman theorem , a fixed point
x¯
is unstable if jf
has at least one eigenvalue with positive real part. unfortunately, we are not aware
of a relation between the determinant of jf
and it’s minors that can be used to show the following: if
detjf
and detjfv∖{v1}
have the same signs, this implies the existence of an eigenvalue with positive real
part and hence implies instability of x¯.
thus we will concentrate on certain graph structures which we call leading vertex
graphs . lvgs are strongly connected components with minimal circuit
covering vertex set v~
that consists of one single element v <dig>  in other words,
g has a vertex that is contained in all elementary
circuits, and hence the characteristic c can be
constructed in a single circuit-closing step. the i-graph of the hematopoietic stem
cell differentiation network consists of sccs that are all lvgs, while the two
networks considered in the proof of proposition  do not belong to this class,
because two circuit-closing steps were necessary in each of these cases. for lvgs we
can show that a positive slope of the characteristic at a zero implies instability of
the respective fixed point. the proof is given in the methods section.

stability of fixed points
in contrast to a positive slope, a negative slope of the circuit-characteristic at a
fixed point coordinate κ∗ alone does not contain
information about the stability of the respective fixed point. we demonstrate this
with two examples. the first one consists of a single negative feedback circuit, the
repressilator model described in  <cit> . this
is a synthetic transcriptional network of the three repressor proteins laci, tetr and
ci and their corresponding promoters, which was constructed to create periodic
expression in escherichia coli: 

  m˙i=α1+pjn+α0−mi=:r−mip˙i=β, 

with i={laci,tetr,ci}, j={ci,laci,tetr}, and
mi and pi are mrna
and protein concentrations, respectively. the system has a trapping region, that is,
a positively invariant region in the state space that is eventually reached by all
trajectories, which guarantees the existence of at least one fixed point. bounds are
given by mimin=α0mimax=α+α0
and pimin/max=mimin/maxi= <dig> , <dig> 
the i-graph  is strongly connected, the circuit set
c consists of one subset that contains all six nodes,
c={{mipi}i= <dig> ,3},
and hence the set v~
has one single element and the graph is a lvg.
 described in  <cit> .

note that because of the symmetry of the model, the circuit-characteristic is
independent of the choice of v~
here. it is given by 

  c=r)))))−κ <dig>  

which can be simplified to 

  c=r))−κ <dig>  

where we have used p¯i=m¯i,
m¯i=r
and p¯1=p¯2=p¯ <dig> 
equation  is strictly decreasing, and, importantly, independent of the parameter
β.

on the contrary, the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix of the system and hence the
stability of the fixed point are not . this
dependence is illustrated in figure  <dig>  where the real and
imaginary parts of the eigenvalues λ of the jacobian
matrix jf
are plotted as functions of β for parameter values α= <dig> 
n= <dig> and α0= <dig>  for these parameter values the
system has a fixed point m¯i=p¯i=12
for all i= <dig> , <dig> . it can be seen
that there exist solutions with positive real part for small values of
β, and hence the fixed point is unstable in this range. it becomes
stable through a hopf bifurcation for increasing values of β. thus we
have shown that jf
and in particular the stability of x¯
depend on β, while c does not.
from this example we conclude that our assumption is not true for zeros of the
characteristic with negative slope. the corresponding fixed point of the system can
generally be stable or unstable. in the methods section proposition  <dig> is verified for
this example.

as a further example we consider the tryptophan regulation network in escherichia

where the state vector x corresponds to the free operator sites
, mrna , enzyme  and tryptophan 
concentrations. c are sigmoidally decreasing
functions, 

  c=kmkm+xm.

furthermore, the fixed points of the system can be determined by the zeros of the
characteristic, as depicted in the figure: for μ= <dig> , for example,
c has a zero at κ4∗= <dig> ,
which corresponds to the fixed point coordinate x¯ <dig> 
inserting this value into x¯i,
i= <dig> , <dig>  we get the fixed point x¯=,
and likewise for the other dilution rates. the qualitative courses of
c and also for the fixed point sets
x¯i
do not differ for the three dilution rates. in particular, the slope of the
characteristic is in all three cases negative at the zero. however, the bifurcation
diagrams in figure  <dig> indicate that the respective fixed points
are stable for μ= <dig>  and μ= <dig> , but unstable for
μ= <dig> . thus this is a further example that a negative slope of the
characteristic at a zero does not imply stability of the respective fixed point.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we have extended previous work on the analysis of fixed points for
regulatory network models. based on the circuit-breaking algorithm, which was introduced
in  <cit>  and which uses the topology of the
interaction graph to construct a one-dimensional circuit-characteristic whose zeros
correspond to the fixed points of the system, we further investigated this
characteristic with respect to fixed points of the system and their stability. here we
demonstrated that the characteristic is in some aspects similar to a one-dimensional
vector field and that the cba is also useful to find fixed point bifurcations.
information about the stability of fixed points can partly be derived from the slopes at
the respective zeros of the characteristic. we used our methods to analyze the fixed
points of models for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, tryptophan regulation in
escherichia coli and the repressilator in escherichia coli. in
particular, we have shown that a positive slope of the characteristic at a zero can
imply instability, at least for certain graph topologies, which we call leading vertex
graphs. these are characterized by leading vertices for all strongly connected
components that are contained in all circuits. although we have noticed that many
network models belong to this model class, this restriction on the topology for sure
limits the use of our approach. however, we believe that the implication can further be
generalized to other network topologies, although a pure translation of the techniques
that we are currently using is not possible. thus a generalization is one topic for
future work.

on the contrary, generally no conclusions about stability can be drawn from a negative
slope, and the respective fixed point can either be stable or unstable. if it is
unstable, we interpret this result as a kind of time-delay. this delay is due to the
response time of the network to changes in the input
κi. it is not visible in the characteristic any
more, where the effects of all feedback circuits have been summarized to a single
effective one comprising only one component. this effect might be similar to a
time-delay that destabilizes a stable fixed point in a one-dimensional vector field.

while this manuscript was in revision, we became aware of a recent paper  <cit>  that seems to be closely related to our work in some
aspects. in this paper, small phosphorylation motifs in signaling pathways are
investigated subject to their ability to show bistable behavior. the authors follow the
same idea of variable elimination to construct finally one-dimensional functions that
contain information about the fixed points of the system and their stability. however,
the techniques used therein are build on mass action kinetics and rational functions and
explicitly use mass conservation relations. however, some of the mathematical ideas
behind that seem to be related to our work, and a further comparison would be
interesting.

generally, the efficiency of the cba and the analysis introduced here depends on the
graph topology and the complexity to solve the implicit equations therein. construction
of the circuit-characteristic is particularly simple and efficient for graph topologies
whose strongly connected components have minimal circuit-covering vertex set
v~
with only few elements, and thus our theory can be particularly helpful to analyze such
networks.

in the future we will try to generalize results further, such that our approach is
applicable to a broad range of regulatory network models. we will also further
investigate the connection between the partial circuit-characteristics and the influence
of the respective sets of circuits that are closed on the coordinates, number and
stability of the system’s fixed points. we believe that our analysis can lead to
the identification of circuit sets which are responsible for certain behaviors of the
system that are connected to bifurcations of fixed points. finally, we hope that we can
contribute towards developing analysis methods that facilitate an understanding of the
role of interrelated feedback circuits in regulatory network models for the
system’s overall behavior.
