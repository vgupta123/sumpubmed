BACKGROUND
cellular aging is a multi-factorial complex phenotype, characterized by the accumulation of damaged cellular components over the organism’s life-span  <cit> . the progression of aging depends on both the increasing rate of damage to dna, rna, proteins, and cellular organelles, as well as the gradual decline of cellular defense mechanisms against stress. this can ultimately lead to a dysfunctional cell with a higher risk factor for disease.

limiting caloric intake without causing malnutrition, also known as calorie restriction , is one of the most conserved non-genetic interventions, which extends life-span in evolutionarily distant species ranging from yeast to mammals  <cit> . inhibition of the nutrient-sensing pathways, using either genetic or pharmacological intervention, also results in a similar phenotype  <cit> . more importantly, increased lifespan is accompanied by an increased healthspan, which delays both the progression and the increasing risk-factor for a wide range of age-related diseases, including cancers  <cit> , cardiovascular disease  <cit> , and multiple neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . the extent to which these pathologies share their underlying biology is a topic of active investigation. emerging evidence, however, supports the hypothesis that large classes of age-related diseases are driven by similar underlying mechanisms  <cit> . understanding and controlling these mechanisms, therefore, constitute critical aspects of preventing or delaying the onset of age-related pathologies. motivated by these observations, considerable effort has been invested in understanding the downstream effectors of the nutrient-sensing pathways that orchestrate cr-mediated life-span extension.

the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been used extensively as a model organism in aging research, due to its rapid growth and ease of manipulation  <cit> . having two different aging paradigms – replicative life-span , defined as “the number of buds a mother cell can produce before senescence occurs”, and chronological life-span , defined as “the duration of viability after entering the stationary-phase”, yeast provides a unique opportunity for modeling both proliferating and post-mitotic cells. understanding the underlying mechanisms driving rls and cls can ultimately be used to shed light on the progression of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, respectively.

yeast cells are typically cultured in growth media containing 2% glucose. reducing glucose concentration to  <dig> % or less is one of the best characterized cr regimens in yeast, which increases both cls and rls  <cit> . the target of rapamycin  has been shown to play a key role in mediating the observed life-span extension in response to cr  <cit> . tor is a serine/threonine protein kinase, which belongs to the conserved family of pi3k-related kinases . it was first identified using genetic studies in yeast while searching for mutants that confer rapamycin-resistance  <cit> . it was later discovered that tor protein kinases, encoded by tor <dig> and tor <dig> genes in yeast, form two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes  <cit> . tor complex  <dig>  is rapamycin-sensitive and consists of both tor proteins, tor <dig> and tor <dig>  together with kog <dig>  lst <dig>  and tco <dig>  on the other hand, tor complex  <dig>  does not contain tor <dig>  is not inhibited by rapamycin, and contains avo <dig>  avo <dig>  avo <dig>  lst <dig>  bit <dig>  and bit <dig>  these two complexes correspond to two separate branches of the tor signaling network, controlling the spatial and temporal aspects of cell growth, respectively, which are conserved from yeast to humans  <cit> . interestingly, torc <dig> also has a critical role in aging and age-related pathologies  <cit> . many of the known oncoproteins act as upstream activators of torc <dig>  while several tumor suppressor proteins inhibit its activity  <cit> . from a systems point of view, torc <dig> acts as a hub that integrates various nutrient and stress-related signals and regulates a variety of cellular responses  <cit> . inhibiting tor signaling using rapamycin provides a unique opportunity to identify its downstream effectors. however, these targets may be regulated in different ways, including, but not limited to, transcription regulation, translational control, and post-translational modifications. capturing various changes that happen during rapamycin treatment, in order to create a comprehensive systems view of the cellular response, is a complex task.

in this paper, we propose a complementary, computational approach to reconstruct a comprehensive map of tor downstream effectors. we develop a systematic approach to couple random walk techniques with rigorous statistical models, integrate different datasets, and identify key targets in calorie restriction that are mediated by tor pathway. using go enrichment analysis of high scoring nodes, we show that information flow analysis not only identifies previously known targets of torc <dig>  but also predicts new functional roles for further studies. we cross-validate our results with transcriptome profile of yeast in response to rapamycin treatment and show that our method can accurately predict transcriptional changes in response to torc <dig> inhibition. information flow scores provide an aggregate ranking of proteins, with respect to their relevance to the tor signaling pathway, and are highly susceptible to degree bias. to remedy this and to elucidate the roles of underlying signaling elements, we propose a novel statistical framework for integrating information flow scores, data on regulatory relationships, and the expression profile in response to rapamycin treatment.

using our framework, we identify the most relevant transcription factors and construct the effective response network of tor, which is responsible for the observed transcriptional changes due to tor inhibition. our approach, unlike experimental methods, is not limited to specific aspects of cellular response. rather, it predicts transcriptional changes, as well as post-translational modifications in response to tor signaling. the resulting interaction map greatly enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the aging process and helps identify novel targets for further investigation of anti-aging regimes. it also reveals potential network biomarkers for diagnoses and prognoses of age-related pathologies and identifies mechanisms for control of cellular aging processes through multi-targeted and combinatorial therapies  <cit> .

RESULTS
computing information flow scores from torc1
given the yeast interactome, constructed using the procedure detailed in methods section and illustrated in figure  <dig>  we compute information flow scores using random walks initiated at selected nodes in the interactome. these nodes comprise members of the torc <dig> complex, each of which propagates a unit flow . we use a discrete random-walk process in which, at each step, every protein aggregates incoming signals and distributes them equally among outgoing neighbors. the final information flow scores are computed as the steady-state distribution of the random-walk process. one of the key parameters in the random-walk process, which controls the depth of propagation, is called the restart-probability. this is the probability that a random walker continues the walk . in order to give all nodes in the interactome a chance of being visited, we use the relationship between restart probability and the mean depth of random-walks by setting parameter α to be equal to d1+d, where d is the diameter of the interactome. for the yeast interactome, we determine the diameter to be equal to  <dig> and set α=67∼ <dig> , correspondingly . figure  <dig> illustrates the distribution of computed information flow scores, starting from torc <dig>  as a function of node distance from torc <dig>  it is evident from the figure that computed scores are functions of both distance from source nodes, as well as multiplicity of paths between source and sink nodes. this can be verified from the overlapping tails of distributions for nodes at different distances, as well as the varied distribution of scores among nodes at the same distance from torc <dig>  the final list of computed information flow scores is available for download as additional file  <dig> 

node rankings from the random walk process are susceptible to degree-bias, favoring high-degree nodes. to remedy this bias and to gain a detailed mechanistic understanding of the roles of various proteins , random walk methods need to be coupled with appropriate statistical tests. a key contribution of our work is the development of such a test, which yields a fine-grained understanding of key pathways involved in orchestrating cellular response to tor inhibition. to the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of information flow methods for reconstructing the effective response network of torc <dig> 

constructing a high-level functional map of tor downstream effectors
torc <dig> is not only regulated by the quality and the quantity of both carbon and nitrogen sources  <cit> , but also by noxious stressors, such as caffeine  <cit> . in response, torc <dig> coordinately orchestrates various aspects of cellular machinery to mediate cell growth  <cit> . this includes autophagy  <cit> , stress response  <cit> , and protein synthesis .

in order to systematically identify the functional aspects relevant to tor signaling, we first rank the proteins in the yeast interactome based on their information flow scores from the torc <dig> complex. given this ranked list, we aim to identify functional terms that are highly over-represented among top-ranked proteins. gene ontology   <cit>  enrichment analysis has been used extensively for this purpose. we employ gorilla  <cit>  to find the optimal cut for each go term, together with its exact minimum hypergeometric  p-value. next, we enforce a threshold of p-value≤10− <dig> to identify the significant terms. the complete list of enriched terms for each branch of go is available for download as additional files  <dig> 

go provides a hierarchical vocabulary to annotate biological processes , molecular functions , and cellular components . this hierarchical structure, represented using a directed acyclic graph , introduces an inherent dependency among the significant terms identified by go enrichment analysis. furthermore, seemingly independent terms under different branches of go may be used to annotate the same set of genes. to provide a compact, non-redundant representation of the significant terms in our experiment, we follow a two-step process. first, we extract the subset of enriched terms that are marked by the saccharomyces genome database   <cit>  as go slim. yeast go slim is a compact subset of the entire go, selected by sgd curators, which is necessary and sufficient to describe different aspects of yeast cellular biology. next, we use enrichmentmap   <cit> , a recent cytoscape  <cit>  plugin, to construct the network  of the enriched terms. in this network, unlike the original interactome, each node represents a significant go slim term and each weighted edge indicates the extent of overlap between genesets of their corresponding terms. we use a custom visualization style to illustrate various network properties. go terms under bp, mf, and cc branches are color-coded red, green, and blue, respectively. the p-value of each term determines the opacity of both the node and its label; the bolder a term appears, the more significant its enrichment score. finally, the total number of enriched genes for each go term is shown using the size of the corresponding node. the final map, which is shown in figure  <dig>  is available for download as additional file  <dig>  this map provides unique opportunities for studying tor-dependent terms visually, since terms  representing relevant sets of genes tend to cluster together in this network.

first, we note that most of the previously known targets of torc <dig> are also identified by our information flow method, as represented in the enrichment map. for example, all terms related to ribosome biogenesis, including relevant cellular components , molecular functions , and biological processes , are clustered in the bottom-left corner of the map. these terms, interestingly, are also clustered with other terms related to protein synthesis, such as regulation of translation, translational initiation, and cytoplasmic translation. furthermore, many of the terms related to stress-response, such as response to dna damage stimulus and dna repair, are clustered in the bottom-left corner of the map. finally, many of the terms related to tor signaling, nutrient uptake, and cytoskeleton organization are grouped on the top section of the map.

additionally, we observe that there are terms in this map that have not been adequately investigated in previous efforts. for example, even though translational control is a well-known function of torc <dig>  transcriptional control is less-studied. several terms related to transcription initiation and elongation are enriched in our analysis, as shown on the bottom-right of the map. in order to gain a mechanistic understanding of these terms, we project the geneset of each term  back to the original network and construct the corresponding induced subgraph in the yeast interactome. as a case study, we extract the set of enriched genes represented by the transcription initiation go term and construct its induced subgraph, which is shown in figure  <dig>  here, nodes, representing proteins, are grouped and annotated based on their functional role in forming the transcription pre-initiation complex , as well as the rna polymerase . the basal level of transcription in eukaryotic cells by rnap needs a family of general transcription factors , prior to the formation of pic. the tata-binding protein , encoded by the spt <dig> gene in yeast, is a universal gtf that is involved in transcription by all three types of nuclear rnap. as a component of tfiiib complex, it forms the pic complex and recruits rnapiii to the transcriptional start site of trnas, 5s rrna, and most snrnas. as a part of tfiid, it forms a complex together with tbp-associated factors  and binds to the core promoter region of the protein-coding genes, as well as some snrnas. the correct assembly of pic, required for directing rnapii to the tss, needs additional gtfs, namely tfiia, -b, -d, -e, -f, and tfiih, as well as the mediator  complex. these components are assembled in an orderly fashion to form the pic and mediate the transcription initiation by rnapii . these complex interactions are faithfully reconstructed in figure  <dig>  which provides a more refined understanding of transcription initiation, under tor control, in the yeast cells.

comparison of predicted targets to the set of differentially expressed genes in response to rapamycin treatment
rapamycin, a lipophilic macrolide originally purified as an antifungal agent and then re-discovered as an immunosuppressive drug, forms a toxic complex with its intracellular receptor fkbp <dig>  encoded by the fpr <dig> gene in yeast, and directly binds to tor in order to perform its inhibitory action  <cit> . we hypothesize that if the information flow-based method agrees with the torc <dig> signaling network, it should be able to predict transcriptional changes due to rapamycin treatment, which inhibits torc <dig> in vivo. to validate this hypothesis, we used a recent mrna expression profile of yeast in response to rapamycin treatment  <cit> . we extracted the set of differentially expressed genes, at a minimum threshold of 2-fold change, and constructed a vector of true positives from this set by filtering out genes that do not have a corresponding vertex in the yeast interactome. the final dataset includes  <dig> repressed and  <dig> induced genes in our experiment.

using this set of true-positives, we computed the enrichment plot of information flow scores by ranking all proteins and computing the hypergeometric score as a function of the protein rank, which is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the peak of the plot, corresponding to the minimum hypergeometric  score, occurs at the index l= <dig> from the top, which covers approximately the top 15% of scores. there are  <dig> positive genes in this partition, from a total of  <dig> positives, yielding a mhg score of  <dig> ∗10− <dig>  we computed the exact p-value corresponding to this mhg score, using the dynamic-programming method of eden et al.  <cit> , resulting in the significant enrichment p-value of  <dig>  ∗ 10− <dig>  this in turn supports our hypothesis that the random-walk neighborhood of torc <dig> is highly enriched with the set of genes that are differentially expressed in response to rapamycin treatment.

post-translational modifications among top-ranked proteins: a case study on gap <dig> regulation
an interesting observation from figure  <dig> is that the highest-ranked genes , marked with a red box, are not enriched in terms of rapamycin-induced genes. this can be explained by the fact that regulatory elements in the tor signaling pathway, including tfs, do not typically change their expression level in response to tor signaling. instead, they are targeted for post-translational modifications . we consequently hypothesize that the top genes should also be enriched in terms of phosphorylation events. to further investigate this hypothesis, we focus on a case study of gap <dig> regulation, a general amino acid permease regulated by ncr. we choose gap <dig> since its regulatory pathway, originating from torc <dig>  is well-studied in literature. moreover, data from phosphoproteomic experiments, which measures phosphorylation events among elements of this pathway, is readily available. specifically, gap <dig> is positively regulated via gln <dig> and gat <dig>  while it is repressed by gzf <dig> and dal <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, all four of these regulators are among top-ranked transcription factors, yet none of them are differentially expressed in response to rapamycin treatment. using a recent phosphoproteome of yeast in response to rapamycin treatment  <cit> , we validated that both of the transcriptional activators of gap <dig>  namely gln <dig> and gat <dig>  are highly phosphorylated in response to rapamycin treatment. moreover, tap42-sit <dig>  which is the upstream regulator of gcn <dig>  is indirectly regulated by torc <dig> 

sensitivity and specificity of information flow scores in predicting key transcription factors
top-ranked proteins in information flow analysis are highly enriched in terms of differentially expressed genes under rapamycin treatment. however, torc <dig> does not directly regulate expression of these genes. this observation raises the question: which transcription factors are responsible and which intermediary elements are involved in these regulations? we answer the first question here, while deferring the latter to subsequent sections.

to find the key transcription factors that modulate the observed transcriptional response, we use two separate statistical predictors, one based on the information flow scores and the other based on the set of differentially expressed genes. these predictors allow us to assess the significance of tfs with respect to their computationally computed, top-ranked and experimentally validated targets, respectively. in the first method, we call a transcription factor relevant if a significant fraction of its target genes are highly-ranked in information flow method. conversely, in the second method we define the relevance in terms of the portion of its differentially expressed targets .

we use p-value and p-value and apply a cutoff value of ε= <dig>  to identify significant p-values computed for computational and experimental predictions, respectively. at this threshold, we compute the sensitivity and specificity of information flow methods as  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the observed high specificity value suggests that if targets of a given tf are not differentially expressed, with high probability, our computational model also reports it as a negative . in other words, transcription factors that are identified as significant using information flow scores are highly precise. on the other hand, the lower sensitivity score implies that even if a tf has many differentially expressed targets, our computational method may miss it. from this, we can conclude that transcription factors that have significant numbers of top-ranked targets are high-confidence candidate as downstream effectors of torc <dig>  however, there are cases where we may miss relevant transcription factors with a significant number of differentially expressed genes by this approach. in the next section, we propose a statistical framework to integrate information flow scores and expression profiles to reliably identify the most relevant subset of transcription factors that are involved in mediating the transcriptional response to tor inhibition, and consequently construct the effective response network of torc <dig> 

identifying the most relevant transcription factors
we now seek to integrate experimental measurements from rapamycin treatment, information flow scores, and the transcription regulatory network into a unified framework to identify the most relevant transcription factors. to this end, we introduce the notion of relevance score. let random variable z denote the number of top-ranked positive targets, and ktp denote the number of top-ranked positive targets of a given tf. we define the relevance score as − log). the relevance score assesses both positivity and rank of the targets for a given tf . using this approach, we identify  <dig> tfs with high relevance scores, which are hypothesized to be responsible for the transcriptional changes in a torc1-dependent manner. the complete list of computed statistics for all transcription factors is summarized in additional file  <dig> 

the top five transcription factors are listed in table  <dig>  among these top-ranked, high confidence, transcription factors, sfp <dig>  gln <dig>  and gcn <dig> are well-documented downstream effectors of torc <dig>  <cit>  . sfp <dig> is a stress- and nutrient-sensitive regulator of cell growth, responsible for mediating the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, such as rp genes and ribi factors  <cit> . torc <dig> mediates sfp1-related genes by phosphorylating sfp <dig> and regulating its nuclear localization  <cit> . gln <dig>  a gata-family transcription factor, positively regulates the expression of nitrogen catabolite repression -sensitive genes  <cit> . torc1-dependent regulation of gln <dig> is mediated by promoting its association with its cytoplasmic anchor protein ure <dig>  <cit> . gcn <dig> is a nutrient-responsive transcription factor, which is activated upon amino acid starvation  <cit> . torc <dig> regulates gcn <dig> by mediating its translation level in a eif <dig> α-dependent manner  <cit> . interestingly, steffen et al.  <cit>  also proposed a critical role for gcn <dig> in mediating life-span in yeast.

however, to the best of our knowledge, ste <dig> and yap <dig> have not been previously positioned downstream of torc <dig>  ste <dig> is best known as a downstream target of mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling cascade and is responsible for regulating genes involved in mating or pseudohyphal/invasive growth  <cit> . rutherford et al.  <cit>  show that over-expression of the ammonium permease mep <dig> induces the transcription of known targets of ste <dig>  a more recent study by santos et al.  <cit>  additionally positions torc <dig> downstream of mep <dig>  which, taken together with the link between mep2-ste <dig>  suggests ste <dig> as a potential downstream effector of torc <dig>  yap <dig> is an ap- <dig> family transcription factor required for inducing oxidative  <cit>  and carbon  <cit>  stress responses, the latter is proposed to be independent of torc <dig>  additionally, yap <dig> expression has been shown to increase significantly during replicative aging  <cit> . it has been suggested that spermidine, a conserved longevity factor  <cit> , mediates macroautophagy in a yap <dig> and gcn <dig> dependent manner  <cit> . finally, there is a diverse set of age-related functions associated with yap <dig>  many of which are also attributed to torc <dig>  these observations suggest yap <dig> as a potential candidate downstream effector of torc <dig> 

constructing the effective response network of torc1
to uncover the regulatory mechanisms that mediate the response to tor inhibition, we construct the effective response network  of torc <dig>  which is illustrated in figure  <dig> and is available for download as additional file  <dig>  node attributes for this network are available for download separately as additional file  <dig>  this network consists of the most relevant tfs, together with their top-ranked positive targets, with a total of  <dig>  regulatory interactions between  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> target genes.

in order to better understand the functional roles of the predicted targets, we use fidea  <cit>  to identify enriched go terms under the biological process  branch. figure  <dig> illustrates the static word cloud of the enriched terms, as generated by fidea, the complete list of which is available for download as additional file  <dig>  unlike the enrichment map of torc <dig>  which spans a variety of different functions, targets in the effective response network  are almost exclusively involved in ribosome biogenesis and the cellular translation process. ribosome biogenesis is one of the most energy-consuming tasks in the cell that is directly linked to the rate of translation and is required for cell growth  <cit> . calorie restriction, or alternatively inhibiting torc <dig> by rapamycin treatment, is known to coordinately regulate this process via a complex set of pathways involving transcription factors ifh <dig>  sfp <dig>  fhl <dig>  and rap <dig> <cit> . interestingly, all four of these transcription factors are identified by our method among the top  <dig> tfs with the highest relevance scores . the effective response network provides a refined view of how yeast cells re-wire various aspects of ribosome biogenesis in order to modulate cell growth. this network can be used to gain a detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for tor-dependent transcriptional changes in yeast.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding various processes associated with aging has important implications for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of age-related pathologies. current methods for constructing aging pathways rely on detailed experiments that study cellular response to carefully controlled signals. this process is expensive, time-consuming, and typically restricted to specific aspects of cellular response. in this study, we presented a complementary, computational approach that aims to construct detailed aging pathways using the yeast interactome by initiating random walks at proteins that are key players in the aging process . at the heart of our method is a rigorous statistical and computational framework that identifies significant effector proteins and provides information about the specific mechanisms associated with them.

we present comprehensive validation of our computational results through go enrichment studies and manual curation to show that our method identifies most of the known proteins downstream from tor, while identifying several new proteins for future experimental investigations. additionally, we showed that information flow scores faithfully predict transcriptional changes in response to rapamycin-treatment, which validates accuracy of predicted effectors. furthermore, we show that the predicted targets are also enriched with proteins that are post-translationally modified  in response to tor inhibition. finally, we constructed the effective response network of the tor pathway. this network is hypothesized to mediate transcriptional changes in response to tor inhibition. a direct outcome of our study is a complete dataset of proteins downstream of tor, their interactions, functional roles, and organization.
