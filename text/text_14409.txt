BACKGROUND
programmed death- <dig>  is a member of the cd <dig> family costimulatory molecules  <cit> . unlike cd <dig>  pd- <dig> has two intracellular tyrosine signaling motifs   <cit>  and recruits intracellular phosphatase shp <dig>  that dephosphorylates and deactivates downstream signal transducers  <cit> . pd- <dig> is expressed by a number of immune cell types including activated t cells, b cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and mast cells in mice. as the ligands for pd- <dig>  pd-l <dig>  and pd-l <dig>  have been identified  <cit> .

in general, engagement of pd- <dig> by pd-l <dig> or pd-l <dig> inhibits tcr-mediated t cell proliferation and cytokine production  <cit> , indicating that the cross-linking of pd- <dig> by its ligands leads to down-regulation of t cell responses in a manner somewhat similar to the effect of ctla <dig> stimulation. pd-1-deficient mice are prone to develop autoimmune diseases such as autoantibody formation, dilated cardiomyopathy, acute type i diabetes, and bilateral hydronephrosis  <cit> . in humans, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pd- <dig> gene are linked to a number of autoimmune diseases including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, graves' disease, type i diabetes, multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and myocardial infarction  <cit> . in mice, blocking of pd- <dig> exacerbated a lupus-like nephritis  <cit> . also, triggering of pd- <dig> suppressed rheumatoid arthritic symptoms  <cit> . while pd- <dig> and its ligands are thought to function to promote immune tolerance, it was also reported that mice deficient in pd and their ligands had fewer long-lived plasma cells, suggesting a certain positive role of pd- <dig> in regulation of humoral immunity in mice  <cit> .

pd- <dig> is highly expressed by a subset of t cells in the germinal centers   <cit> . in contrast, most human b cells do not express pd- <dig>  <cit> . additionally, pd- <dig> is preferentially expressed on exhausted cd8+ t cells during chronic viral infection  <cit> . although the suppressive function of pd- <dig> on cd8+ t cells has been studied extensively, the phenotype and role of pd-1-expressing cd4+ t helper cells in regulation of humoral immune responses have been unclear. we investigated the phenotype and function of pd-1-expressing t helper cells in human tonsils and the function of pd- <dig> in regulation of these t cells. our study revealed that pd-1-expressing human helper t cells are heterogeneous in pd- <dig> expression, chemotactic response, tissue localization, cytokine response, and effector function. moreover, triggering of pd- <dig> can restrain the b cell-helping function of the pd-1high  t cells.

RESULTS
pd-1-expressing t helper cells are heterogeneous in pd- <dig> expression and tissue localization in human tonsils
we examined the pd- <dig> expression by t cells, b cells and dendritic cells in human tonsils. pd- <dig> was mainly expressed by cd4+ t cells but neither by cd19+ b cells nor cd11c+ dendritic cells . among the cd4+ t cells, naïve cd45ra+ t cells were pd-1-. however, almost all memory  t cells expressed pd- <dig> at various levels . they can be fractionated into three subsets  based on the level of pd- <dig> expression. 15-20% of pd- <dig> dim  cells were foxp3+ or cd25+ t cells .

we investigated the localization of the pd-1-expresing t cells. the pd-1+++ cells that expressed pd- <dig> at the highest level were localized in the outer rim of gc adjacent to the mantle zone . in contrast, pd- <dig> dim  cells were frequently found in either the center of gc or interfollicular areas . pd-1+++ t cells were localized close to igd+ b cells in the mantle zone . some pd-1-expressing t cells were found even inside the mantle zone . there was no clear association of the sites of pd-1-expressing t cells and dendritic cells . both small and large germinal centers had pd-1-expressing t cells . the numbers and location of these t cells in various primary and secondary follicles demonstrate that pd- <dig> high  t cells are the germinal center t cells, while pd- <dig> dim  t cells are in the t cell area or mantle zone.

pd-1-expressing t cells differentially express secondary lymphoid tissue-homing chemokine receptors
the differential localization of pd-1-expressing t cells in human tonsils is intriguing. we investigated the expression of key chemokine receptors, cxcr <dig> , ccr <dig> , and cxcr <dig> , which are known to regulate the localization of the t cells in secondary lymphoid tissues . all pd-1-expressing t cells expressed cxcr <dig>  thus meeting the definition of follicular t cells. compared to pd-1+/++ t cells, however, pd-1+++ t cells even more highly expressed cxcr <dig>  naïve pd-1- t cells did not express cxcr <dig>  interestingly, ccr <dig> expression was exactly the opposite of the cxcr <dig> expression pattern with pd-1+++ t cells expressing ccr <dig> at the lowest level. while all of the subsets expressed cxcr <dig>  it was the pd-1+++ t cells that expressed cxcr <dig> at the highest level.

next, we examined the activity of the chemokine receptors expressed by the pd-1-expressing t cells . pd-1+++ t cells were highly responsive to cxcl <dig> but poorly migrated to ccl <dig>  pd-1+/++ t cells were responsive to both cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> at moderate levels. pd-1+++ t cells were more responsive to cxcl <dig> than pd-1++ t cells. overall the chemotactic responses were in line with the expression levels of chemokine receptors.

because the high expression of cxcr <dig> by pd-1+++ t cells and their localization in the rim of gc, we examined the in situ expression of cxcl <dig> at protein level . it was found that cxcl <dig> was expressed by the stromal cells in the mantle zone and throughout the interfollicular area but not significantly within gc. it was notable that the site of cxcl12-expression in the mantle zone was found right next to the sites of pd-1+++ t cell localization . thus, it appears that pd-1+++ t cells localize to the outer rim of gc adjacent to the mantle zone because of the combined chemotactic force of cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> in the absence of the chemotactic influence of ccl19/ccl <dig> 

pd-1-expressing t cells have distinct surface antigen and cytokine production phenotypes
in order to gain more insights into the phenotype of the pd-1-expressing t cells, we examined the expression of various surface antigens such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd62l, and leukocyte function antigen  <dig> . all pd-1-expressing t cells were cd69+. pd-1+++ t cells highly expressed the adhesion molecule lfa <dig> but not cd62l and integrin β <dig>  cd <dig>  was specifically expressed by a subset of pd-1+++ t cells. cd <dig>  was decreased on pd-1+++ t cells. thus, pd-1+++ t cells have the surface phenotype, cd69+ lfa3+ cd10+/- cd127- cd62l-. loss of cd <dig> is commonly cited as a phenotype specific for foxp3+ t regulatory cells but the phenotype of pd-1+++ t cells suggests that it is actually a shared phenotype among certain effector or regulatory t cells.

we further investigated the cytokine production capacity and co-stimulation receptor expression property of the pd-1-expressing t cells. all of the three pd-1-expressing t cell subsets were able to produce il- <dig> and tnf-α . pd-1- t cells were largely of naïve t cells and included some cells capable of producing il- <dig>  and tnfα . however, the pd-1-expressing t cells were heterogeneous in production of ifn-γ and il-17: pd-1+++ cells included few th <dig> or th <dig> cells, while pd-1+ t cells contained most th <dig> and th <dig> cells, suggesting that most polarized effector t cells belong to the pd-1+ t group . pd-1+++ t cells contain a small number  of il- <dig> or il-10-producing t cells. il- <dig> or il- <dig> producers were hardly detected. pd-1+++ t cells highly expressed co-stimulator receptors such as ox <dig> and icos . also, intracellular cd40l was expressed more highly by pd-1+++ t cells than pd-1+ or pd-1++ cells.

the pd-1-expressing t cells are heterogeneous in production of cxcl <dig>  cell proliferation and survival
in order to study the function of the pd-1-expressing t cells, we isolated naïve t cells, pd-1+, pd-1++, and pd-1+++ t cells at high purities  utilizing an antigen density-dependent magnetic sorting  developed for the study . il- <dig> is a major cytokine for follicular helper t cells in helping b cells. il- <dig> expression by t cells was proportional to their expression levels of pd- <dig> expression . we reported previously that a subset of gc-t cells can produce cxcl <dig>  <cit> . we determined if the pd-1-expressing t cells have the same phenotype. as shown in figure 5b, pd-1+++ t cells were most efficient in cxcl <dig> production. overall, the cxcl <dig> production ability of the pd-1-expressing t cells correlated well with the pd- <dig> expression level. we, next, examined the proliferation and survival ability of the pd-1-expressing t cells. unlike pd-1+ t cells and pd-1++ cells, pd-1+++ t cells failed to proliferate in vitro in response to stimulation with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> antibodies . the pd-1+++ t cells had a poor survival ability in the absence of any stimulatory signals. the cell survival rate of pd-1+ t cells was higher than those of pd-1+++ cells and pd-1++ cells . approximately, 15% of pd-1+++ cells were ki-67+ t cells, which indicates proliferation of these t cells . these results indicate that pd-1+++ cells are active in proliferation in vivo but are prone to cell death and difficult to activate for proliferation in vitro.

roles of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in survival and proliferation of pd-1-expressing t cells
next, we examined if cytokines can regulate the survival and proliferation of pd-1-expressing t cells. both il <dig> and il <dig> were able to promote the survival of pd-1+++ t cells . while il <dig> was able to induce proliferation of pd-1+++ t cells, il <dig> was not effective in this activity . one interesting difference between the pd-1+++ cells and pd-1++ cells is that il- <dig> was able to readily induce the proliferation of pd-1++ cells but not pd-1+++ t cells, which is in line with their low cd <dig> expression. in contrast, il <dig> had no notable effect on the survival or proliferation of the pd-1-expresing t cells. these results indicate that pd-1+++ t cells can be induced for cell proliferation in an appropriate cytokine milieu.

lack of function for il- <dig> or il- <dig> in maintenance or generation of pd-1+++ t cells in vitro
il- <dig> and il- <dig> are implicated in generation of follicular helper t cells in mice  <cit> . we examined the impact of il- <dig> and il- <dig> on the stability of the pd-1-expresing t cells. for this, the t cell subsets were cultured for 6- <dig> days in the indicated conditions, and expression of cxcr <dig>  ccr <dig>  and pd- <dig> was examined. naïve t cells gained some expression of cxcr <dig> but they did not lose ccr <dig>  pd-1+, pd-1++, and pd-1+++ t cells maintained the expression of cxcr <dig>  ccr <dig> and pd- <dig> throughout the culture period . il- <dig> and il- <dig> had no effect on the stability of the pd-1-expresing t cells in terms of expression of pd- <dig>  cxcr <dig> and ccr <dig> 

we consider that expression of cxcr <dig>  pd- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and il21; and loss of ccr <dig> are the features of mature follicular helper t cells that can effectively help b cells and are localized in the gc  <cit> . we examined if il- <dig> and/or il- <dig> has any role in generation of the pd-1-expressing cxcr5+ b cell-helping t cells. we observed that these cytokines did not promote the expression of cxcr <dig>  il- <dig>  or cxcl <dig> by antigen-primed human naïve t cells at the mrna  and protein level .

pd- <dig> triggering restrains the b cell-helping ability of pd-1+++ t cells in a cell-specific manner
the information that pd-1+++ t cells are found in gc and express b cell-helping effector molecules such as icos and cd40l suggests that pd-1+++ t cells are highly specialized effector t cells for helping b cells. we co-cultured the pd-1-expressing t cells and b cells and assessed their b cell-helping activity. as shown in figure 7a, there is a striking positive correlation between the pd- <dig> expression and the ability to promote b cell antibody  production. this was true for both naïve b cells and gc b cells as target cells. neutralizing antibodies to icos and cd40l almost completely abolished the b cell-helping activities of pd-1+++ t cells .

a question that remains to be answered regarding the function of pd-1+++ t cells is about the role of pd- <dig> expressed by the t cells. utilizing pd-l2-fc fusion protein, we stimulated the pd- <dig> receptor of the t cells. we used a pd-l2-fc fusion protein, but not a pd-l <dig> protein because pd-l <dig> can trigger also b7- <dig> in addition to pd- <dig>  <cit> . pd- <dig> stimulation moderately increased the cxcl <dig> production but decreased the proliferation and b cell-helping ability of pd-1+++ t cells . however, the same stimulation had no effect on pd-1+ + t cells. this suggests an overall negative role for the pd- <dig> specifically expressed by the pd-1+++ gc-t cells.

discussion
we investigated the phenotype and function of pd-1-expressing t helper cell subsets in human tonsils. unexpectedly, pd- <dig> is expressed by all memory, but not naïve, t cells in tonsils. the pd-1-expressing t cells, however, are heterogeneous in the pd-1-expression level, trafficking receptor phenotype, tissue localization, and effector function in helping b cells. pd-1+++ t cells can stimulate gc b cells for generation of plasma b cells within the gc, while pd-1dim  t cells are enriched with th <dig> and th <dig> cells, reside in the mantle zone of gc or interfollicular area, and have weaker b cell-helping activity. interestingly, pd- <dig> triggering limits the activity of pd-1+++ t cells in helping b cells.

expression of several receptors such as cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and ccr <dig> is the major determining factor for localization of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues that are divided into t and b cell areas including the interfollicular area, gc, and mantle zone. coordinated expression of the three receptors regulates the exact microanatomical positioning of lymphocytes in mice  <cit> . this is because the chemokine ligands that bind the receptors are differentially expressed in the t cell area , the b cell area , and certain areas of gc/interfollicular area   <cit> . the expression patterns of cxcl <dig> in mice and humans are somewhat different from each other. in mice cxcl <dig> is more expressed in the gc dark zone  <cit> , while it is expressed at mrna level by specialized reticulum cells that surround gc  <cit>  or at the protein level in the mantle zone and interfollicular area in human tonsils as shown in this study. the chemokine receptor phenotypes of pd- <dig> expressing t cell subsets are in line with the expression sites of the three chemokines. pd-1+++ t cells are cxcr4++ cxcr5++ ccr7low and reside in the rim of gc adjacent to the mantle zone. pd-1++ t cells are cxcr4+ cxcr5+ ccr7low, which would put them elsewhere in gc. the cxcl <dig> expressed in the mantle zone would attract pd-1+++ t cells but these cells also highly express cxcr <dig> to stay within the gc close to the mantle zone. pd-1++ t cells express cxcr <dig> but not ccr <dig> and stay within the gc. they express cxcr <dig> at a reduced level and, thus, are more scattered throughout gc instead of localized to the rim of gc. pd-1+ t cells express both cxcr <dig> and ccr <dig> at a moderate level and would stay in the peri/interfollicular area outside of gc as the result of the balanced chemoattraction between cxcl <dig> and ccr <dig> ligands .

an interesting function of human gc-t cells is to produce cxcl <dig>  <cit> , which is thought to attract cxcr5+ t cells, b cells, dendritic cells, and follicular dendritic cells to form and expand gc. interestingly, the cxcl <dig> production ability of pd-1-expressing t cells is positively associated with their pd- <dig> expression level. we found that the gc-localized pd-1+++ t cells are highly efficient in production of cxcl <dig>  other features of these pd-1-expressing gc-t cells include expression of lfa <dig>  cd40l, icos, ox <dig>  and cd <dig>  lfa <dig> is important for cell-cell interaction, and thus, is likely to play a role in their interaction with other cells for cell activation and effector function  <cit> . icos, cd40l and ox <dig> are co-stimulatory receptors which would be involved in activating target cells  or the t cells themselves. we observed that the icos and cd40l signals are required for the optimal b cell-helping activity of pd-1+++ t cells. the function of cd <dig> in gc is unclear at this time but it is likely that pd-1+++ t cells would be a normal counterpart of cd10+ angioimmunoblastic t-cell lymphoma in human patients  <cit> .

it has been determined previously that gc-t cells are prone to cell death and do not proliferate well  <cit> . some even called the cells anergic  <cit> . the dilemma in calling them "anergic" is that many t cells in gcs are active in cell cycling  <cit>  and they are functionally active in producing il <dig> and cxcl <dig> and helping b cells. these functions cannot be performed, at least by definition, by anergic t cells. moreover, pd-1+++ t cells, although as suggested before to be apoptotic and non-proliferative, can be driven to survive and proliferate in response to il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> can rescue the t cells from cell death. active proliferation of pd-1+++ t cells in vivo is supported by expression of ki- <dig> by many pd-1+++ cells in tonsils. these results suggest that the pd-1+++ gc-t cells are actively propagating in the gc environment in response to antigen presenting cells and cytokines. we noted also that the pd-1+++ t cells were highly stable and did not lose their phenotype in expression of pd- <dig> and cxcr <dig> and in b cell-helping function upon subsequent antigen stimulation.

it is still controversial what directly regulates the generation of fully committed b cell-helping t cells, which express il <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcr <dig> and pd- <dig> but not ccr <dig>  icos, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> are implicated in increasing the number of cxcr5-expressing t cells or b cell-helping t cells in mice  <cit> . as internal transcription factors, bcl <dig>  c-maf, stat <dig> and batf <dig> are implicated in regulating the number of cxcr5+ or b cell-helping t cells in vivo  <cit> . il- <dig>  a cytokine for th <dig> cells, can increase the cxcr <dig> and il <dig> expression by human t cells  <cit> . also, il- <dig> can increase the cxcr <dig> expression by naïve t cells in response to activation by dendritic cells  <cit> . we found in this study that il <dig> and il- <dig> lack the ability to induce the fully differentiated gc-t cells in vitro. one should note that cxcr <dig> induction is a spontaneous event following t cell priming in vivo  <cit> , and is not sufficient by itself to define fully committed b cell-helping effector t cells. also, il <dig> is widely produced by different t cell types, and, thus, expression of il <dig> alone would not be sufficient to define fully differentiated gc-t cells. in this regard, to date, none really established a reproducible in vitro system to induce a stable b cell-helping effector t cell lineage with a gc tropism . our results point out that there are several subsets of cxcr5+ t helper cells with distinct phenotype and cell function. "follicular t helper cells," defined by cxcr <dig> expression alone, is an ambiguous term, and these t cells are actually comprised of heterogeneous t helper subsets. additional phenotypes such as effector function, tissue localization and expression of additional antigens such as ccr <dig> should all be considered in characterization of the diverse b cell-helping t cells.

a key question would be "what is the function of pd- <dig>  highly expressed by gc-t cells?" it has been established that mice deficient with pd- <dig> expression are prone to develop various autoimmune diseases  <cit> . some of these autoimmune diseases are induced, in part, by autoantibodies produced by b cells, a process promoted by gc-t cells. thus, we hypothesized that pd- <dig> has the function of down-regulating the t-cell-dependent b cell responses. to test this hypothesis, we stimulated the pd- <dig> by pd-l2-fc protein and observed that the pd-1+++ t cell-dependent antibody response was decreased. also, observed was suppressed proliferation of pd-1+++ t cells by the pd- <dig> triggering. however, the production capacity of cxcl <dig> was not altered. these results suggest that pd- <dig> can limit the magnitude of gc-t cell response. the degree of suppression following pd- <dig> triggering was moderate which suggests that pd- <dig> triggering would not completely shut down the gc-t cell response. hyper-activity of pd-1+++ t cells would cause chronic inflammation or autoimmune diseases. pd- <dig> appears to function to restrain the function of pd-1+++ t cells possibly to prevent the aberrant humoral immune responses.

CONCLUSIONS
pd-1-expressing human t helper cells are highly heterogeneous, including pd-1high , pd-1medium , and pd-1dim  cells in tonsils. among them, pd-1+++ t cells have the phenotype of the germinal center t helper cells in tissue localization, cellular phenotype and effector function. triggering of pd- <dig> restrains the b cell-helping activity and proliferation of pd-1+++ germinal center t cells, supporting the role of pd- <dig> in promoting tolerance in humoral immunity.
