BACKGROUND
sexual reproduction is generally characterized by the equal transmission of nuclear genomes from mothers and fathers to offspring, and by equal expression of maternal and paternal alleles in offspring  <cit> . however violations of mendelian inheritance can arise when the genetic interests of the mother and father diverge  <cit> . males benefit if their offspring can secure more resources from the offspring’s mother, whereas females normally benefit if their offspring are provisioned equally regardless of paternity. these sexual conflicts can lead to parent-of-origin effects, arising from genomic imprinting, where offspring phenotype is altered depending on whether an allele is inherited from a mother or a father  <cit> . imprints are laid down during gametogenesis, during an epigenetic reprogramming event that results in the non-equivalence of paternal and maternal genomes  <cit> . for example, mice embryos derived from two maternal genomes or two paternal genomes via pronuclear transfers are non-viable due to parent-specific imprinting  <cit> .

parent-specific epigenetic modifications that give rise to genomic imprinting often occur via dna methylation, which involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosine residues of dna  <cit> . in addition to its role in imprinting, dna methylation varies between cell types due to cellular differentiation  <cit> , and may also vary according to genotype due to allele-specific methylation  <cit> . dna methylation can alter the expression and regulation of genes  <cit> . when methylation occurs in promoter regions, it results in suppression of gene expression. when methylation occurs in the exons and introns of gene bodies, it increases or maintains gene expression and may mediate alternate splicing . gene body methylation is conserved among plants, invertebrates and mammals, and may therefore represent an ancestral function of dna methylation  <cit> . not all invertebrates have dna methylation, but if it is present it is generally restricted to gene bodies and affects only a small percentage of cytosines genome-wide  <cit> .

colonies of hymenopteran insects  provide a situation that is ripe with potential for intra-genomic conflict and thus for imprinting . hymenoptera are haplo-diploid. females arise from fertilized eggs and are diploid, while males derive from unfertilized eggs by arrhenotokous parthenogenesis and are haploid. workers almost never lay eggs when a queen is present but are physiologically able to produce haploid eggs that give rise to males. this ability allows workers of some species to occasionally ‘cheat’ and lay haploid eggs that produce viable males  <cit> . in many eusocial hymenopterans the queens are polyandrous  <cit> . because females mate with multiple males, any male who can epigenetically modify his female offspring so that they are more likely to become reproductively active will be favored by selection, as his offspring will outcompete those of males that do not do so  <cit> .

unlike mammals where parthenogenesis generates inviable offspring due to imprinting , some hymenopterans can produce diploid female offspring from unfertilized eggs by thelytokous parthenogenesis  <cit> . thelytoky, the asexual production of female offspring, is rare in honey bees generally but ubiquitous in workers of the subspecies apis mellifera capensis   <cit> . in capensis, mated queens reproduce sexually, identically to all other honey bee subspecies, by the union of egg and sperm nuclei within a newly-laid egg. in contrast to other honey bee species, capensis workers lay diploid eggs that develop into females , by the fusion of two maternally-derived pronuclei, as if one pronucleus acted as a sperm, again within a newly-laid egg  <cit> . embryogenesis otherwise occurs normally as it would in a fertilized embryo, resulting in the production of diploid females.fig.  <dig> design of the experiment. a a capensis queen was inseminated with sperm from a single capensis drone, to produce fertilized embryos. a subset of embryos were collected to produce the fertilized embryo methylome, while the remaining embryos were left to emerge to adult workers. when the queen was removed, the daughter workers began to produce diploid eggs thelytokously and these embryos were used to produce the thelytokous embryo methylome. b early meiotic divisions in fertilisation and thelytoky follow the same process. the first meiotic division occurs after oviposition in a newly laid egg. if the egg is fertilized there will be 3– <dig> spermatozoa, one of which becomes the male pronucleus. during thelytokous reproduction, the egg is unfertilized and two maternal pronuclei fuse to form a diploid nucleus  <cit> 



thelytokous parthenogenesis as described above generates embryos that are ‘pseudoclones’ of their worker parent. that is, thelytokous offspring receive one copy of the two grandparental genomes and are largely identical to their thelytokous parent, unless recombination during meiosis has resulted in loss of heterozygosity  <cit> . while thelytoky enables workers to genetically re-incarnate themselves, it is currently unknown how the epigenetic component of the genome is inherited following thelytokous meiosis. sexually-produced embryos laid by a queen inherit both a maternally- and a paternally-derived set of chromosomes, whereas thelytokous eggs contain pronuclei that have undergone gametogenesis within the ovaries of female workers. thus thelytokous embryos begin life with two maternally-inherited pronuclei,  and may show different patterns of methylation to sexually-produced embryos. therefore capensis provides the ideal system in which to examine parent-of-origin effects, as it naturally generates diploid bi-parental and diploid uni-parental embryos.

as yet we have only indirect evidence for genomic imprinting and parent-of-origin effect in social insects in general, and honey bees in particular. however three observations suggest the presence of imprinting in the honey bee. first, methylation patterns differ significantly between unfertilized eggs and sperm, suggesting that queens and drones differentially methylate their gametes  <cit> . second, reciprocal crosses between honey bee subspecies show substantial parent-of-origin effects for reproductive traits, again suggestive of paternal imprinting . finally, in reciprocal crosses of africanised and european honey bees,  <dig> transcripts showed significant parent-of-origin expression effects  <cit> . a second study using africanised and european honey reciprocal crosses determined that hybrid workers showed paternally biased phenotypes and expression patterns, particularly relating to reproduction, suggesting that in honey bees worker reproduction is driven by patrigenes  <cit> .

in addition to its potential role in genomic imprinting, dna methylation has additional functions in hymenoptera . in honey bees it is involved in larval development  <cit> , and differentiation into queen and worker castes  <cit> . methylation patterns differ between the brains of honey bee queens and workers  <cit> , as well as between adult workers during behavioural maturation  <cit> . the majority of genomic methylation is associated with constitutively-expressed, highly-conserved genes  and, approximately half of all genes are methylated  <cit> . methylation may provide a mechanism by which gene dosage is regulated between the haploid and diploid castes  <cit> . how methylation is regulated, and the mechanisms by which dna methylation is directed to particular sites and genes is unknown.

here we examine the methylation patterns of fertilized, sexually produced, bi-parental embryos laid by capensis queens with asexually produced, parthenogenetic, uni-parental embryos produced by their thelytokous daughter workers . we determine whether thelytokous embryos with two maternal genomes have different patterns of methylation to sexually-produced embryos with a maternal and paternal genome. to control for genotype, experimental queens were artificially inseminated, each with sperm from a single drone. therefore, the worker progeny were genetically homogenous, each worker carrying one allele from the inseminating male, and one of the queen’s two alleles. at a cohort level, the workers carried just three alleles, two that were maternally derived, and one that was paternally derived. on average, the worker-laid embryos were genetically identical to those of the queen-derived embryos, and differed only in epigenetic modifications. the presence of three alleles in common through two generations enabled us to follow the methylation patterns of each allele in both fertilized and thelytokous embryos.

if paternal imprinting exists, we would predict significantly more methylated sites in sexually-produced embryos due to methylation present in the paternally-inherited sperm pronucleus. in thelytokous embryos, we expect fewer methylated sites overall. conversely, for maternally imprinted alleles we would predict significantly higher levels of methylation at specific maternally imprinted sites in thelytokous embryos, due to a double dosage of two maternally imprinted genomes. an absence of differential methylation between thelytokous and fertilized diploid embryos would be strong evidence that imprinting does not occur in the honey bee. evidence of allele-specific methylation would show that epigenetic modifications are heritable in the honey bee or that they are invariably established according to cis-mediated genotype, but could also confound our ability to detect imprinting.

methods
sample collection, dna extraction and sequencing
we produced three colonies  by insemination of three virgin capensis queens, each with the semen of a single capensis drone. the parents were sourced in stellenbosch, south africa. the inseminated queens were introduced into separate queenless host colonies. after the introduced queens began laying we collected between  <dig> and  <dig> fertilized embryos from each colony  into 99 % ethanol.

once all host workers had been replaced by worker-offspring of the inseminated queens , we removed the queens from the colonies. the now queenless capensis workers commenced laying thelytokous eggs approximately 1 week after the removal of the queen. these capensis daughter workers produced diploid eggs via thelytokous parthenogenesis. we collected between  <dig> and  <dig> worker-laid embryos from each colony , again into ethanol.

we used microsatellite analysis to confirm that individual embryos produced by workers from this colony were all thelytokous diploid females and not arrhenotokous haploid males  <cit> . we also confirmed that dna from the fertilized and thelytokous embryos contained the same microsatellite alleles at five unlinked loci, and that there were no more than three alleles at each microsatellite confirming two alleles were derived from the queen and one allele from the sperm from the single drone  <cit> . this proves that our colonies had not been invaded by reproductive parasites, as often happens in queenless a. m. capensis colonies  <cit> .

our design resulted in three independent sets of paired embryos  that were diploid and genetically  equivalent . embryos were collected over similar time frames, so if methylation patterns change during embryonic development, these changes would be equivalent in both cohorts.

colony  <dig> generated sufficient fertilized  and thelytokous  embryos for whole genome bisulfite sequencing. to extract dna we removed the ethanol, rinsed the embryos in water, and resuspended them in g <dig> buffer . embryos were lysed in a tissue lyser and treated with 2 mg/ml rnase at 37 °c for 30 min, proteinase k at 56 °c for two hours, and dna purified using 20g genomic tips . we quantified the amount of dna in the extracts using the qubit flurometer . the final yield for fertilized and thelytokous embryo samples was  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg, respectively. we added lambda bacteriophage dna , promega) to each sample as a spike-in control to evaluate the efficacy of the bisulfite conversion  <cit> . bisulfite conversion, library construction and sequencing were performed at the beijing genomics institute as described in drewell et al.  <cit> .

embryos from colonies  <dig> and  <dig> were reserved for bisulfite pcr validation of candidate genes.

whole genome bisulfite sequence mapping
we used bsmap v <dig>  to determine methylation state of cytosine residues from the whole genome sequencing  <cit> . bisulfite reads were aligned to the a. mellifera genome assembly  <dig>   <cit>  as described in drewell et al.  <cit> .

a. m. capensis is a different subspecies to the reference genome - a. m. ligustica  <cit> . if there is significant polymorphism between the capensis and reference genomes then the proportion of bisulfite reads that could be successfully aligned to the reference genome would be reduced. to assess the extent of variation between the capensis and reference genomes, we obtained a. m. capensis genome sequence data from wallberg et al,  <cit>  and generated a ‘capensis <dig> ’ reference genome. briefly, we aligned the a. m capensis reads  <cit>  to the a. mellifera genome assembly  <dig>  using bwa v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the alignment of the 75 bp capensis reads resulted in  <dig> -fold coverage of the reference genome. we utilized the alignment to determine snps and attempted to generate an alternate ‘capensis <dig> ’ reference. file conversions, snp calling and creation of an alternate reference was performed with samtools v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and gatk v <dig>   <cit> . we repeated bsmap bisulfite mapping to the generated capensis <dig>  reference. compared to the original mapping results, fold coverage and methylation calls  were not significantly improved . we therefore continued analysis based on the alignment to the a. mellifera assembly  <dig> , so that our data can be directly compared with existing methylomes  <cit> .

we determined the bisulfite conversion rate in our dna samples by calculating the c-to-t conversion rate in the lambda spike-in control. using bsmap we aligned reads to the bacterophage lambda genome . based on the number of converted cytosines to total lambda cytosine coverage, we estimated the bisulfite conversion rate as  <dig>  for the fertilized embryo sample, and  <dig>  for the thelytokous embryo sample.

methylation analysis
the number of methylated cytosines in each sample was calculated as in drewell et al.  <cit> . at each cytosine site, we compared the number of bisulfite-converted reads  and the number of non-converted reads . we performed a binomial test to determine significant methylation, with a probability of one minus the lambda phage dna conversion rate, correcting for multiple comparisons  <cit> .

to quantitate differential methylation between the two samples, the output from bsmap was analysed using the r package methylkit  <cit> . to compare the frequency of methylated cytosines at cpg sites, we first excluded sites with less than  <dig> fold coverage. sites containing a methylation difference of 25 % or greater, with a p value of  <dig>  or less were deemed to be differentially methylated, and annotated against the official gene set from a. mellifera assembly  <dig> .

bisulfite pcr validation
bisulfite pcr was conducted on samples of fertilized and thelytokous eggs from the two remaining colonies,  <dig> and  <dig>  dna was extracted from  <dig> embryos per sample, using the dneasy blood and tissue kit . two independent bisulfite conversion reactions were performed per sample . bisulfite pcr assays were designed for five candidate genes, stan , stoned b , sap <dig> , syd  and pcl . nested primers were selected spanning a region containing as many differentially methylated sites as possible within each candidate gene and pcr products were amplified . previous studies have noted the difficulties of amplifying regions greater than 500–600 bp in length from bisulfite converted dna  <cit> . using the two-step nested pcr and kapa 2g robust dna polymerase , we were able to amplify 793 bp , 650 bp , 1022 bp , 1224 bp  and  <dig> and 1375 bp , fragments from the candidate genes . for three genes , pcr products from each independent bisulfite reaction, for each sample were separately cloned into the topo vector  and a minimum of  <dig> individual amplicons were sequenced for each sample . fragments amplified from the other two genes  could not be cloned or did not generate sufficient clones for analysis after repeated attempts.

RESULTS
cpg methylation frequency in the capensis genome
on average we obtained  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold genome coverage for fertilized and thelytokous embryo samples, respectively, achieving a similar level of coverage to previous honey bee methylation studies  <cit> . genome-wide, the proportion of total cg sites covered by  <dig> to  <dig> reads was  <dig>  % for fertilized embryos, and  <dig>  % for thelytokous embryos . there were  <dig>  methylated cytosines in the cg context in fertilized embryos and  <dig>  in thelytokous embryos. the proportion of cg sites in the genome that were methylated was  <dig>  % for fertilized embryos and  <dig>  % for thelytokous embryos, consistent with previous studies of the honey bee methylome  <cit> . taking into account the total genome-wide number of cg sites covered by 2– <dig> reads in both samples, the number of methylated cg sites was significantly greater in fertilized embryos than in thelytokous embryos .table  <dig> coverage and context of cytosine methylation in fertilized and thelytokous embryo samples

we define methylated sites as those where the proportion of non-converted bisulfite reads was significantly higher  than the background bisulfite non-conversion rate . ignoring sites that had less than two reads in either sample,  <dig>  cg sites were significantly methylated in both samples . there were  <dig>  cg sites methylated in fertilized embryos but not thelytokous embryos, and  <dig>  sites methylated in thelytokous embryos but not fertilized embryos .fig.  <dig>

across methylated cg regions, individual cytosines varied in methylation frequency, ranging from  <dig> to 100 % methylation . the methylated sites that were common to both fertilized and thelytokous embryos had a median methylation frequency of 83 % in thelytokous embryos, and 80 % in fertilized embryos . in contrast, the methylated sites that were unique to either fertilized or thelytokous embryos tended to have less methylation. in thelytokous embryos the median methylation frequency of sites showing some methylation was 67 %. in fertilized embryos the median methylation frequency was 60 % . this indicates that capensis embryos share a core set of common cg sites that are highly methylated, regardless of whether the embryos arise sexually or thelytokously. sites that are methylated only in fertilized or thelytokous embryos tend to have lower methylation frequency .fig.  <dig>

non-cpg methylation
we identified over  <dig>  cytosine methylation sites in a non-cg context . some of these sites were artifacts arising from vector/mammalian contamination that are present in the amel <dig>  reference sequence . to examine whether the remaining non-cg sites corresponded to actual capensis cg sites that are absent from the amel <dig>  reference genome , we examined the snps present from our capensis <dig>  alignment derived from wallberg et al.  <cit> . only  <dig>  and  <dig>  non-cg sites corresponded to snps in the capensis <dig>  reference sequence . it is likely that at least some non-cg methylated sites correspond to snps present in our source population that were not present in the capensis population used by wallberg et al.  <cit> . finally, a small number of false positives are expected to arise from incomplete bisulfite conversion and errors generated by the next generation sequencing process  <cit> . despite these caveats we observed a large number of non-cg methylated cytosines in fertilized and thelytokous embroys . note, however, that very few non-cg methylated sites  were present in both samples.

differentially methylated cytosines
comparison of significantly methylated sites between genomes that have variable coverage may yield false positives due to insufficient coverage in one of the genomes being compared. to avoid biased differential methylation calls based on coverage differences, we determined that the median coverage across methylated cg sites in fertilized and thelytokous embryos was five-fold , so we restricted our comparison to sites with five or more reads in both samples. using the r package methylkit  <cit> , we determined the number of significantly differentially methylated cg sites between fertilized and thelytokous embryos. a total of  <dig>  sites had significantly different methylation .  <dig> of those sites contained at least a 25 % difference in methylation frequency. if a differentially methylated cg site contained 25 % higher methylation in one sample compared to the other, such sites were considered hypermethylated. fertilized embryos had significantly more hypermethylated sites  compared to thelytokous embryos .fig.  <dig> comparison of differentially methylated cg sites with at least five-fold coverage in fertilized and thelytokous embryos. percent difference  is calculated by percent methylation in fertilized embryos minus thelytokous embryos. non-significant sites are indicated in grey. a total of  <dig>  sites had significantly different methylation between the two samples, with  <dig> hypermethylated sites having at least 25 % difference in methylation frequency between the two samples. fertilized embryos had  <dig> hypermethylated sites  compared to thelytokous embryos with  <dig> hypermethylated sites 



genes containing differentially methylated sites
we examined the genomic context of differentially methylated sites and found that in both samples over 75 % of sites were located in exons and over 90 % in gene bodies . we could therefore assign the majority of differentially methylated sites to annotated genes. as expected from the observation that there are significantly more hypermethylated cg sites in fertilized embryos, there was a significant bias towards hypermethylation of genes in fertilized embryos . the top genes containing at least four hypermethylated sites in either fertilized or thelytokous embryos, are shown in table  <dig> . eight genes with four or more hypermethylated sites in fertilized and thelytokous embryos were present among the top  <dig> differentially methylated genes  from our previous comparison of haploid eggs and sperm  <cit> . in that study, these eight genes all had significantly higher methylation in haploid eggs compared to sperm. the 14th dmg in haploid eggs relative to sperm  <cit> , stan  contained  <dig> hypermethylated sites in fertilized embryos . the top two dmgs in haploid eggs, stoned b  and sap- <dig>   <cit> , were both among the most hypermethylated genes in fertilized capensis embryos with four and five hypermethylated sites, respectively .table  <dig> genomic context of hypermethylated cg sites in fertilized and thelytokous embryos

bisulfite pcr validation of candidate dmgs
if genomic imprinting occurs in capensis, we predict that genes inherited from males and females will be differentially methylated at some sites. if so, paternally methylated genes would be hypermethylated in fertilized  embryos relative to unfertilized  embryos. accordingly, we determined if patterns of methylation differed depending on whether they were inherited from a male or a female. when examining whole genome bisulfite sequencing data, it is difficult to trace methylation back to an original paternal or maternal allele due to the removal of many informative snps during conversion of unmethylated cytosines to thymine. the problem is exacerbated by short reads, which often uncouple any remaining informative snps from methylation haplotypes. therefore, we used bisulfite pcr encompassing larger fragments of candidate genes to investigate allele-specific methylation. we selected three candidate genes that contained a number of hypermethylated sites in fertilized eggs, stan , stoned b  and sap <dig>  to examine the level of methylation in the fertilized and thelytokous embryos collected from our two remaining colonies,  <dig> and  <dig>  to determine the parent of origin of each allele, we sequenced the same gene in the fathering male. thus for fertilized eggs we could identify which allele was paternal and which was maternal. in thelytokous eggs we could determine whether an allele was originally derived from the grandmother or the grandfather.fig.  <dig> direct sequencing of bisulfite pcr products of stan  from colony  <dig> and  <dig> fertilized and thelytokous embryos. a summary of the 794 bp region of stan used for bisulfite pcr sequencing. the location of stan exons are indicated in orange. methylated sites determined in the whole genome bisulfite sequencing of colony  <dig> are shown for fertilized  and thelytokous . the * indicates cg sites that were deemed as hypermethylated in fertilized embryos, where  <dig> of the  <dig> hypermethylated sites are encompassed by the bisulfite pcr region. b&c allele-specific methylation patterns of colony  <dig>  and colony  <dig>  fertilized and thelytokous embryos. the total number of cg sites present in the bisulfite pcr region is indicated as open ovals below exons . methylated cg sites are indicated as red ovals, and snps are designated as blue rectangles. the  <dig> alleles are labeled p <dig>  and m <dig> and m <dig> 



sequences of stan showed three distinct alleles in each colony, via informative g-to-a snps. within a colony, fertilized and thelytokous embryos carried the same three alleles . based on sequences of stan obtained from the drone fathers used as sperm donors in colonies  <dig> and  <dig>  we assigned the paternally-derived allele as allele p <dig>  and inferred the maternally derived queen alleles as allele m <dig> and m <dig> for each colony .

the methylation patterns of each stan allele varied considerably. in colony  <dig>  allele p <dig> showed the highest level of methylation, with an average of 51 % of the  <dig> possible cg sites methylated in fertilized embryos and 56 % in thelytokous embryos . allele m <dig> showed the lowest levels of methylation, with 10 %  and 3 % , and m <dig> was intermediate with 34 %  and 28 % . in colony  <dig>  p <dig> had intermediate methylation levels , m <dig> the highest  and m <dig> the lowest . thus while the percentage of methylation and the location of methylated sites between alleles differed greatly, within-allele methylation was similar between fertilized and thelytokous samples in the two colonies .table  <dig> percent methylation of the three alleles present in colony  <dig> and colony  <dig> for the stan  gene

the degree of methylation in stoned b in colony  <dig> and colony  <dig> was much lower than the methylation present in the whole genome bisulfite sequence of colony  <dig> fertilized and thelytokous eggs, and not all of the three alleles could be identified based on snps. thus a comparison of allele-specific methylation could not be made for this gene, although there was some evidence for differential methylation in amplicons where two alleles could be distinguished .

due to lack of informative snps, we could not distinguish between the three alleles in sap <dig>  although for this gene methylation levels were similarly high to the whole genome bisulfite sequence in colony  <dig> . in colony  <dig>  three of the  <dig> cg sites present were significantly more highly methylated in fertilized embryos and one more highly methylated in thelytokous embryos; and in colony  <dig>  two cg sites were significantly more highly methylated in fertilized embryos .

discussion
if imprinting occurs in honey bees, we would expect to see a difference in the methylation patterns of bi-parental, fertilized embryos produced by union of an egg and sperm, compared to uni-parental, thelytokous embryos produced by parthenogenesis. here we have shown that embryos derived from the union of a paternal and maternal genome had about 10 % more total methylated cg sites , twice as many hypermethylated cg sites  and twice as many hypermethylated genes  than genetically identical embryos that arose from the union of two maternal genomes. candidate genes that are parentally-imprinted may therefore exist among the hypermethylated genes. this finding enhances earlier theoretical , phenotypic , and genomic  <cit>  evidence that honey bees use their dna methylation system to imprint certain genes in a parent-of-origin specific manner.

biologically and technically replicated bisulfite sequencing of one of the top hypermethylated genes in fertilized eggs, stan, revealed allele-specific methylation. the three alleles in each of colonies  <dig> and  <dig> had differing methylation patterns that were strongly correlated with genotype. this allele-specific methylation was the same between fertilized and theytokous embryos, and is therefore inconsistent with paternal or maternal imprinting: methylation was the same regardless of the sex of the parent of origin .

while the most intensely studied examples of allele-specific methylation relate to parent-of-origin imprinting, it has been reported that the most widespread form of allele-specific dna methylation in humans is determined by dna sequence in cis  <cit> . sequence-dependent or cis-mediated allele-specific methylation has been mapped to the human genome  <cit>  revealing many snps and genomic regions that are associated with variation in dna methylation  <cit> . while allele-specific methylation resulting from genomic imprinting is a non-mendelian process, cis-mediated allele-specific methylation that is genetically determined is inherited in a mendelian manner. an epigenetic mechanism that is genetically determined creates another level of genome regulation where the genotype and epigenotype are both involved in generating the phenotype.

the mechanisms behind genetically-determined allele-specific methylation are unclear  <cit> . the allele-specific methylation observed in stan included one g-to-a snp that resulted in the removal of a cg site, thus physically interrupting the process of methylation. however the majority of methylation differences were not as clear and may be a result of long-range affects of polymorphisms that modify chromatin structure and affinity of dna binding proteins  <cit> .

mono-alleleic methylation leading to allele-specific gene expression has previously been reported in ants  <cit>  and bumblebees  <cit> , and in both cases the authors hypothesised that differences were due to parent-of-origin effects. an alternate explanation is that the observed mono-alleleic methylation was due to cis-mediated allele-specific methylation, and that sequence-specific methylation is widespread in hymenoptera. there is one other report of cis-mediated allele-specific methylation in honey bees  <cit> , where differentially methylated obligatory epialleles of the amlam locus were correlated with sequence variation and resulted in different transcription levels. if allele-specific methylation is as widespread as it is in the human genome, it may have a major impact on the epigenetic contribution to phenotype in hymenoptera.

whole genome bisulfite sequence analysis indicated that stan was hypermethylated in fertilized embryos compared to thelytokous embryos at multiple cg sites but bisulfite pcr validation in colonies  <dig> and  <dig> did not support this conclusion. the difference in our genomic comparison may have arisen from unequal sampling of each of the three alleles present in colony  <dig>  such that more highly methylated alleles were over-represented in the genomic reads in our fertilized egg sample. in the whole genome bisulfite data, the mean coverage for stan was  <dig>  reads in fertilized embryos and  <dig> reads for thelytokous embryos. at this level of coverage, it is possible that the three alleles were unequally covered.

whole genome bisulfite sequencing has previously been used to compare methylation patterns between social insect castes with contrasting results  <cit> . allele specific methylation may confound genome-wide analysis of differential methylation in any species where there is cis-mediated allele-specific methylation. this kind of problem may be particularly acute in social insect species like honey bees where queens mate with multiple males. for example, if we compare groups of workers of different ages or tasks and conclude that their methylation patterns are different, our conclusion may be confounded by non-equal representation of alleles that have inherently different patterns of methylation. recent evidence suggests that lack of biological replication could result in sample-specific, rather than caste-specific differences, leading to incorrect conclusions arising from genome-wide methylation patterns  <cit> . where possible, an experimental design that enables biological replication or alternative methods of validation is required to support conclusions of differential methylation. a combination of high-coverage analysis  <cit> , single drone inseminated queens  <cit>  and reciprocal crosses  <cit>  should allow specific alleles to be followed and provide a means to definitively distinguish between parent-of-origin and cis-mediated allele-specific methylation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that global dna methylation patterns differ between diploid embryos produced sexually and by thelytokous parthenogenesis. our experiment minimized differences between embryos that were unrelated to uni- or bi-parental origin. these patterns of differential methylation between bi-parental and uni-parental eggs are consistent with imprinting. nonetheless we caution that at least some of these patterns may be a consequence of cis-mediated allele specific methylation. in particular, our demonstration of allele-specific methylation in stan means that not all epigenetic differences between between bi-parental and uni-parental embryos can be attributed to parent of origin effects.
