BACKGROUND
the sxt mobile genetic element was originally isolated from an emerging epidemic strain of vibrio cholerae , which causes the severe diarrheal disease cholera  <cit> . formerly referred to as a conjugative transposon, sxt is now classified as being a type of integrating conjugative element   <cit> . unlike bacteriophages and plasmids, ices cannot replicate their double stranded dna  genomes autonomously. they integrate into the chromosome of the bacterial host, and replicate along with the host's chromosomal dna. in response to certain physiological signals, they excise their genomic material and form a covalently closed circular double stranded  molecule  <cit> . sxt inserts its ca.  <dig> kb dsdna genome into the 5'-end of the prfc gene on the v. cholerae chromosome in a site-specific manner  <cit> . after induction of the sos response, sxt excises itself and re-circularizes into an extrachromosomal form which may be transferred by bacterial conjugation to recipient donor cells  <cit> . the genomic composition of sxt is closely related to that of r <dig>  an ice originally isolated from providencia rettgeri   <cit> , and they are fellow members of a large family of self-transmissible mobile genetic elements  <cit> . the sxt/r <dig> ices encode multiple proteins conveying resistance towards heavy metals  and antibiotics   <cit> . as such, they are efficient vehicles for the horizontal transfer of resistance genes within susceptible bacterial populations  <cit> .

the sxt genome contains three consecutive coding dna sequences  arranged in an operon-like structure, which encode homologues of 'phage-like' proteins involved in dna repair and/or recombination  <cit>  . the encoded s <dig> protein  is highly homologous to bacterial single strand dna  binding proteins ; s <dig>  is homologous to the bet single stranded annealing protein  from bacteriophage lambda ; and s <dig>  shares homology with the lambda exo/yqaj family of alkaline exonucleases  <cit>  . related ices  all encode essentially identical bet, exo and ssb genes  within highly similar genetic contexts  <cit> .

alkaline exonucleases are widely found in the genomes of viruses , bacteriophages and other self-transmissible genetic elements  <cit> . the alkaline exonuclease from bacteriophage lambda  has been the subject of intense study since its discovery and isolation in the 1960s  <cit> . however, the in vitro activities of only one other closely-related homologue have been studied in any great detail; namely g <dig> p from bacteriophage spp <dig>   <cit> . the spp1-chu and lambda-exo alkaline exonucleases both digest linear dsdna molecules with strict 5'- to 3'- polarity. they bind to the termini of the dsdna molecules and progressively hydrolyze the 5'-strand in a highly processive manner, releasing 5'-mononucleotides and generating long 3'-ssdna tails  <cit>  . the partnering ssap protein  coats the nascent 3'-ssdna tails, forming helical nucleoprotein filaments  <cit> , and promotes their annealing with complementary regions of  single stranded dna on the bacteriophage, episome or host chromosome  <cit> . this 'strand annealing' pathway may occur at double strand breaks  or at the replication fork. other host cell dna recombinases  such as reca may also play a role in recombination events, and strand invasion of an intact dna duplex may, or may not occur  <cit> . dna repair and replication proteins from the bacterial host cell then process and resolve the branched dna intermediates formed  <cit> . the alkaline exonuclease may also 'trim' any ssdna overhangs formed after ssap-mediated annealing events, enabling the resultant nicks to be closed by dna ligase  <cit> .

aside from their native biological roles, the activities of partnering ssap and alkaline exonuclease proteins  have attracted increasing interest for their use in bacterial in vivo dna homologous recombination-based genetic engineering procedures  <cit> . in an approach referred to as 'recombineering', partnering ssap and alkaline exonuclease proteins co-expressed within a bacterial host cell efficiently mediate homologous dna recombination  between pcr-generated linear dsdna molecules and the desired chromosomal or episomal target, via short regions  of shared sequence homology. phenotypic changes or selectable markers e.g. antibiotic resistance genes are generally required to detect recombination events. although the precise mechanism has not yet been established, it appears that only partnering alkaline exonuclease and ssap proteins  can associate with each other and function together to promote dna recombination; e.g. lambda-exo does not bind to, or functionally-cooperate with the e. coli rect protein  <cit> .

genetic studies have recently revealed that the sxt-bet  and sxt-exo  proteins promote dna recombination between two different ice molecules residing within the same heterologous host cell , leading to the formation of 'hybrid' ices  <cit> . furthermore, datta et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that sxt-bet can efficiently promote genetic recombination between single stranded oligonucleotides and the e. coli chromosome. this prompted us to characterize the biochemical and biological activities of the sxt-exo and bet proteins, to help establish their proposed involvement in dna recombination events.

here, we show that sxt-exo is a processive alkaline exonuclease with the ability to digest linear, but not circular ssdna and dsdna molecules. we further demonstrate that ssap and ssb proteins stimulate the in vitro dsdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo. when expressed from plasmids established in e. coli cells, the sxt-exo and sxt-bet proteins mediate the homologous recombination of pcr-generated dsdna fragments with the chromosome via short flanking regions of shared sequence homology.

quantitative determination of double strand dna exonuclease activities by quenched picogreen fluorescent assays
the double strand exonuclease activities of sxt-exo and lambda-exo under various conditions were determined by quantifying the amounts of double strand dna that remained after enzymatic incubation, using the picogreen dna fluorescence reagent . these quenched picogreen fluorescence assays were performed as described previously  <cit>  with minor modifications. all experiments described below utilized analogous assay procedures, which were performed in 96-well microtitre plates . four to six independent replicates were performed for each experimental condition; with graphs showing the mean values ± standard deviation. unless otherwise stated, assays  contained sxt-exo protein  in exonuclease buffer . assays were initiated by the addition of  <dig> μl of a solution of the dna substrate, typically psti-linearized puc <dig> , in exonuclease buffer; and were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> mins, before quenching by the addition of edta to a final concentration of  <dig> mm. picogreen reagent was then added  and fluorescence levels were immediately measured  using a perkin elmer  <dig> multi-label counter. the degree of dsdna digestion was determined using: /; where n = fluorescence reading for the starting dna concentration; r = fluorescence reading at the quenched time point; p = fluorescence reading obtained for half of the concentration of linear dsdna substrate used in the assay, which had been heat-denatured .

determination of double strand dna end preference for sxt-exo and lambda-exo using annealed oligonucleotide substrates
the 50cy <dig>  and 70cy <dig>  oligonucleotides both contain cy <dig> fluorescent groups at their 3'-termini, and were phosphorylated at their 5'-termini using t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  according to the manufacturer's instructions, then purified . the 50blunt  and 70overhang  oligonucleotides do not contain 3'-cy <dig> groups, and were not 5'-phosphorylated. three partially double stranded dna substrates were prepared by thermally annealing various oligonucleotide pairs: "blunt ended" = 5'-po4-50cy <dig> + 50blunt; "5'-overhang" = 5'-po4-70cy <dig> + 50blunt; and "3'-overhang" = 5'-po4-50cy <dig> + 70overhang . with the careful exclusion of light, equimolar amounts of each oligonucleotide in millipure water were heated to 100°c for  <dig> minutes, then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. substrates were used without further purification. exonuclease assays: reaction mixtures  contained: i) sxt-exo , tris-hcl ,  <dig>  mm mncl <dig>  and  <dig> pmol of one of the blunt ended, 5'-overhang or 3-overhang annealed oligonucleotide substrates; or ii) lambda-exo  in tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  and  <dig> pmol of one of the blunt ended, 5'-overhang or 3'-overhang annealed oligonucleotide substrates. assays were incubated at 25°c, and  <dig> μl aliquots were withdrawn and quenched with  <dig> μl of gel loading buffer  at the times indicated in the text . samples were stored on ice in the dark prior to resolution on denaturing polyacrylamide gels . gels were scanned for fluorescence using a typhoon™  <dig> variable mode imager . band intensities on the scanned gel images were quantified using quantity one software  to calculate the degree of digestion of the  5'-po4-70cy <dig> or 5'-po4-50cy <dig> oligonucleotides. data were fitted to hyperbolae using origin v <dig>  sr <dig>  figures show the mean values obtained  and omit the standard deviation for reasons of clarity. in separate experiments,  <dig> pmol;  <dig> pmol;  <dig> pmol;  <dig> pmol;  <dig>  pmol;  <dig>  pmol;  <dig>  pmol and  <dig>  pmol of the 5'-po4-70cy <dig> and 5'-po4-50cy <dig> oligonucleotides were resolved on  <dig> m urea-tbe polyacrylamide gels, and analogously scanned for fluorescence to construct standard curves .

determination of exonuclease processivity and rate
the procedure used was analogous to that previously described by myers and co-workers  <cit> . sxt-exo  and psti-linearized puc <dig> dna  in  <dig> μl of tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl were pre-incubated for  <dig> mins at 25°c. reactions were initiated by the addition of  <dig> μl of tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm mncl <dig>  and were incubated at 25°c. after  <dig> s, unbound sxt-exo was 'trapped' by the addition of heparin  in exonuclease buffer .  <dig> μl aliquots were withdrawn at various time points  and quenched with edta . levels of dsdna were immediately quantified using picogreen reagent as described above. analogous control experiments using a 'trapping' buffer without heparin  were performed. the number of nucleotides digested was determined by calculating the percentage of dna substrate digested at each time point, then multiplying this value by 1343; which is the number of nucleotides available for digestion per dna strand on the linearized  puc <dig> molecule, assuming digestion occurs from both termini. four independent replicates of each experiment were conducted, and graphs show the mean values ± standard deviation. to obtain the processivity and initial rate of dna digestion at 25°c, data from the heparin trap experiments was fitted to a hyperbola using origin v <dig>  sr <dig> as previously described  <cit> .

protein-mediated modulation of the double stranded dna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo and lambda-exo
sxt-exo , and  <dig> pmol of the protein indicated in the text  in  <dig> μl of exonuclease buffer were incubated at 25°c for  <dig> mins. psti-linearized puc <dig>  in  <dig> μl of exonuclease buffer was added to initiate the reaction, incubating assays at 25°c for  <dig> mins before quenching . levels of dsdna were immediately quantified using picogreen reagent as described above. in analogous experiments, lambda-exo  and  <dig> pmol of the protein indicated in the text , in  <dig> μl of tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> were incubated at 25°c for  <dig> mins. psti-linearized puc <dig>  in  <dig> μl of tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> was added to initiate the reaction, incubating assays at 25°c for  <dig> mins before quenching and analyzing dsdna levels using picogreen reagent. six replicates of each experiment were performed, and data was analyzed using anova . figures show the mean values ± standard deviation, with corresponding p values indicated .

oligonucleotide exonuclease assays
a 75-mer of oligothymidine  was used directly, or where applicable, was phosphorylated at the 5'-terminus  using t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  according to the manufacturer's instructions. assays  containing dt <dig> or 5'-p-dt <dig>  in tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> were initiated by the addition of sxt-exo . reactions were quenched immediately  or after incubation at 37°c for  <dig> or  <dig> minutes. protein was removed after precipitation by consecutive heating , cooling , and centrifugation . supernatant  was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using a tricorn superdex  <dig> hr 10/ <dig> gl column pre-equilibrated with  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta; at a flow-rate of  <dig>  ml/min at 4°c, monitoring the elution of oligonucleotides at  <dig> nm. a standard curve for dt <dig> was constructed . the area under the main peak on the gel filtration chromatogram , was proportional to the amount of dt <dig> present.

determination of double strand dna recombination activities
a chloramphenicol resistance  cassette was pcr-amplified from plasmid pegfp-loxp-cmr-loxp  <cit>  using primers ecgalkf <dig>  and ecgalkr <dig> , to create a dsdna molecule  that contained  <dig> bp flanking regions with sequence homologous to the 5'- and 3'-ends of the e. coli galk gene . these primers were analogous to those previously described by yu et al.  <cit> , which were used to perform analogous galk gene targeting experiments with the lambda-red proteins. the cm<>galk pcr product was gel-purified ; dna was eluted from the spin column with  <dig> mm tris-hcl . plasmids pbad-etγ, pb1e4a, pbex4b <dig>  pbx2b and pbad-28mcs were separately transformed into e. coli dh10b by electroporation. individual transformant colonies  were inoculated into lb medium containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin , which were incubated with shaking at 37°c overnight. aliquots from the overnight cultures were expanded 1: <dig> in fresh lb medium containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin , and were incubated with shaking . expression was induced by the addition of filter-sterilized aqueous arabinose solution  to a final concentration of  <dig> %, and flasks were incubated with shaking . flasks were then rapidly chilled in ice-water  for  <dig> minutes, cultures were decanted into pre-chilled  <dig> ml falcon tubes, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation . after carefully decanting the medium, cell pellets were gently washed with ice-cold sterile water , and centrifuged as before. washed cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold sterile water  and transferred to pre-chilled  <dig>  ml microcentrifuge tubes placed in wet-ice. the purified cm<>galk dsdna targeting cassette  was added to each tube, and after 2- <dig> minutes, aliquots of the resuspended cell pellets  were pipetted into  electroporation cuvettes placed on ice. immediately after electroporation , lb medium  was added to the electroporation cuvettes, and the resuspended cell mixtures were transferred to  <dig>  ml microcentrifuge tubes, and were allowed to recover . a  <dig> μl aliquot was removed, diluted 1: <dig>  in lb media then plated onto lb-agar in order to calculate the surviving cell count. the remaining ca.  <dig> ml of transformed cell suspension was centrifuged  then the entire cell pellet was plated onto lb-agar containing  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol. agar plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hours prior to colony counting. the recombination efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of chloramphenicol-resistant colonies by the number cells surviving electroporation .  <dig> cm-resistant colonies from each plate were screened by pcr, to check that the cmr cassette had been chromosomally-integrated in the correct manner. all experiments were performed in duplicate, and repeated  <dig> times . errors were calculated on the mean values ± standard deviation.

RESULTS
sxt-exo forms a trimer analogous to lambda-exo
the sxt-exo , sxt-bet  and sxt-ssb  genes were cloned into pet28a vectors  and expressed in e. coli as  <dig> amino acid n-terminal t7-hexahistidine fusions . the bet and exo genes from bacteriophage lambda were cloned into pet32a vectors  and expressed in e. coli as 8aa c-terminal hexahistidine fusions . all five of the recombinant his-tagged proteins were purified by immobilized ni-affinity chromatography followed by desalting, and were determined to be 95-99% pure by sds-page . with the exception of sxt-exo, the purified recombinant proteins all exhibited good long-term physical stability in a variety of buffer systems . consequently, all experiments involving sxt-exo were performed using batches of freshly-expressed and purified protein.

the multimericity of the recombinant sxt-exo and lambda-exo proteins were determined using size exclusion chromatography . two peaks were apparent in the sxt-exo chromatogram . sds-page analysis of eluted fractions corresponding to both peaks confirmed that they contained only sxt-exo protein . the minor peak  corresponded to a molecular weight of ca.  <dig> kda, which equated to ca.  <dig> sxt-exo monomers. the major peak  correlated to a molecular weight of  <dig> kda, which corresponded to ca.  <dig>  sxt-exo monomers. lambda-exo eluted at  <dig>  ml , correlating to a molecular weight of  <dig> kda, which corresponded to  <dig>  protein monomers. this indicated that the recombinant lambda-exo and sxt-exo proteins both formed stable trimers in solution, with no monomeric forms detected. this strongly suggests that sxt-exo adopts a 'doughnut-shaped' homotrimeric arrangement analogous to that of lambda-exo  <cit> . the torroidal trimers of both these two proteins possibly migrate faster through the gel-filtration column due to their flattened, non-spherical topology . the high molecular weight, soluble aggregation of ca.  <dig> sxt-exo protein monomers is most likely an artefact due to heterologous over-expression in e. coli, and is probably not biologically relevant. consequently, in all subsequent biochemical assays, the concentrations of the sxt-exo and lambda-exo proteins were reported in terms of moles of trimers, as this is most likely the active form of both exonucleases.

qualitative determination of sxt-exo nuclease activities
the lambda-exo and spp1-chu proteins essentially require a divalent metal ion cofactor for exonuclease activities  <cit> . therefore, we first investigated the ability of sxt-exo to digest linear dsdna in the presence of millimolar concentrations of various divalent metal ions . results indicated that only mn2+ and mg2+ ions could function as cofactors for the dsdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo . we then investigated the substrate range of sxt-exo, determining its ability to digest a variety of linear and  circular double stranded and single stranded dna molecules. a large excess of sxt-exo protein was incubated with undigested puc <dig> plasmid dna to determine whether it had the ability to nick or cleave covalently closed circular dsdna molecules . results clearly indicated that sxt-exo had no endonuclease or nicking activities. similarly, incubation with m13-phage dna  demonstrated that sxt-exo could not cleave circularized ssdna. in these respects, sxt-exo has substrate specificities analogous to those of spp1-chu and lambda-exo  <cit> .

aliquots from a time-course analysis of the sxt-exo mediated digestion of ndei-linearized pet28a are shown in figure  <dig>  panel c. it could be seen that the concentration of linear dsdna molecules decreased steadily over time , but their sizes remained relatively unchanged. this finding was consistent with sxt-exo digesting dsdna with significant processivity; i.e. it sequentially hydrolyzed numerous nucleotides from each termini without dissociation of the protein from the dna chain.

nikiforov et al. have previously shown that the 5'- to 3'-exonuclease activities of the t <dig> gene  <dig> protein could be effectively inhibited by the incorporation of phoshorothioate groups into the dna backbone, in place of 'natural' phosphodiester linkages  <cit> . we used an analogous approach to determine the digestion polarity of the sxt-exo exonuclease . a pcr-based strategy was used to synthesize a 5'-phosphorylated linear double stranded dna substrate  containing  <dig> consecutive 'nuclease resistant' phosphorothioate linkages near the 5'-termini was synthesized. an analogous 5'-phosphorylated linear dsdna molecule without phosphorothioate modifications  was similarly prepared. as the phosphorothioate linkages are only present near the 5'-termini of each strand of the dna duplex in the 'pt-modified' substrate, they should not interfere with the activities of an exonuclease with 3'- to 5'-polarity. however, an enzyme with 5'- to 3'-polarity should be significantly inhibited. lambda-exo and sxt-exo were separately incubated with these two dna substrates  and their digestion products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis . negligible amounts of the 'pt-modified' linear dsdna substrate were digested by sxt-exo under the conditions used , whereas the 'unmodified' linear dsdna substrate was fully digested . under analogous conditions, lambda-exo completely-digested the 'unmodified' dsdna substrate  but only digested a small amount of the phosphorothioate modified dsdna . this clearly indicated that sxt-exo digests linear dsdna with 5'- to 3'-polarity, analogous to the lambda-exo and spp1-chu proteins  <cit> .

quantitative determination of sxt-exo double strand dna exonuclease activities using the sensitive fluorescent picogreen reagent
we quantified the dsdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo under a variety of different experimental conditions using sensitive fluorescence assays incorporating the picogreen reagent . this approach has previously been utilized by myers and co-workers to dissect the activities of lambda-exo and spp1-chu   <cit> . the picogreen reagent fluoresces intensely when complexed with double stranded dna, but exhibits very low fluorescence levels in the presence of free nucleotides or single stranded dna chains  <cit> . using this reagent, it is possible to accurately quantify the amount of dsdna that has been enzymatically-digested. purified psti-linearized puc <dig> dna  was used as a representative linear dsdna substrate for all picogreen assays.

as our initial results had indicated that sxt-exo essentially required mg2+ or mn2+ ions for catalytic activity, we first used quenched picogreen fluorescence assays to determine which concentrations these divalent metal ions were optimal for its dsdna exonuclease activities . results indicated that mn2+ was optimal at  <dig>  mm , whilst mg2+ was most effectively utilized at  <dig> mm . at optimal mg2+ and mn2+ concentrations, the rates of dsdna exonuclease activities were equivalent . analogous sets of picogreen assays were then used to characterize the dsdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo between ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . dna digestion rates formed a skewed bell-shaped distribution between these ph values, with an optimum at ph  <dig>  . activities fell-off markedly above ph  <dig> . the operational temperature range for the sxt-exo protein was similarly investigated. its dsdna exonuclease activities increased steadily between  <dig> and 41°c, reached a maximum at ca. 42°c, then dropped-off sharply at temperatures higher than this . sxt-exo was essentially inactive at 47°c.

inhibition of sxt-exo dsdna exonuclease activities by phosphate and various inorganic salts
to gain a better understanding of other factors influencing the biochemical activities of sxt-exo, we systematically investigated how the addition of various inorganic salts affected its ability to digest linear dsdna . analogous sets of quenched picogreen fluorescence assays were used to determine the relative effects of sodium , potassium  and calcium  cations; as well as chloride , phosphate  and sulfate  anions. phosphate ions strongly inhibited the dsdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo, with sodium phosphate having an ic <dig> of  <dig> mm . this may be due to competition for the dna internucleotide phosphodiester group binding sites within the protein trimer, or may possibly be due to interference with the putative protein binding site for the 5'-po <dig> group at the terminus of the dna strand being digested  <cit> . electrostatic effects or divalent metal ion chelation effects  may also play a role. sulfate ions similarly inhibited sxt-exo at concentrations above ca.  <dig> mm; with sodium sulfate having an ic <dig> of ca.  <dig> mm, and potassium sulfate having an ic <dig> of ca.  <dig> mm . its mode of inhibition may be analogous to that of phosphate, as this anion contains a roughly-similar geometrical arrangement of oxygen atoms around a central non-metal atom.

the dsdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo steadily decreased with increasing concentrations of na+ and k+ ions, but were only significantly inhibited at concentrations above ca. 200- <dig> mm . this general inhibitory effect by na+ and k+ ions at high concentration appears to be common to most, if not all related exonucleases, but the reported inhibitory sensitivities vary significantly, e.g. see references  <cit> . at the concentration used in the standard exonuclease buffer , nacl appeared to have negligible inhibitory or stimulatory effects. notably however, potassium ions stimulated enzymatic activities 20% at concentrations between 50- <dig> mm. baylis et al.  <cit>  and stolzenberg and ooka  <cit>  similarly noted that the bgl <dig> alkaline exonuclease from epstein-barr virus had optimal activities in the presence of ca.  <dig> mm of potassium or sodium ions.  <dig> mm cacl <dig> almost entirely inhibited sxt-exo dsdna exonuclease activities . by analogy with structural observations previously noted for lambda-exo  <cit> , and the fact that calcium ions also inhibit the rece  <cit>  and recbc exonucleases  <cit> , it appears most likely that ca2+ inhibits sxt-exo via direct competition with the divalent metal ion  binding sites.

dna substrate preferences
having determined how various chemical and physical parameters affect the dsdna activities of the sxt-exo protein, we next focussed on characterizing its dna substrate preferences in a quantitative manner. sets of picogreen assays analogous to those described above were used to investigate the rates at which sxt-exo digested linear dsdna molecules containing different types of ends . blunt-ended linear dsdna substrates, as well as ones containing small  3'- or 5'-ssdna overhangs at each terminus, were prepared by digesting puc <dig> plasmid dna with the sspi, psti or bamhi restriction enzymes, respectively. linear dsdna molecules containing short 5'-ssdna overhangs at each termini  appeared to be digested ca. 30-50% faster during the initial phase of incubation with sxt-exo  than corresponding blunt-ended substrates, or ones containing short 3'-overhangs . however, after ca.  <dig> minutes this initial effect was compensated for; and after  <dig> minutes there were no significant differences in the overall percentages of linear dsdna substrate consumed. notably, sxt-exo digested psti-linearized puc <dig>  ca. 20-fold more effectively than 5'-dephosphorylated psti-linearized puc <dig> . this demonstrated that sxt-exo had a strong preference for linear dsdna molecules that contained 5'-phosphorylated ends, compared with ones that had lacked 5'-phosphate groups.

to determine whether sxt-exo had ssdna 'trimming' activity  <cit>  we investigated its ability to digest both non-phosphorylated and 5'-phosphorylated forms of a synthetic  <dig> mer of oligothymidine . sxt-exo  was incubated with  <dig> pmol of dt <dig> or 5'-p-dt <dig> in tris-hcl buffer  containing  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> at 37°c. reactions were quenched immediately , as well as after  <dig> minutes and  <dig> minutes; then products were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. this enabled both the length  and concentration  of oligonucleotide reaction products to be determined. overlays of the three chromatograms obtained for reaction products formed at the three time points are shown in figure  <dig> . various amounts of oligo-dt <dig>  were analogously analyzed using gel filtration chromatography, to confirm that the area under the main peak eluting at  <dig>  ml on the chromatogram was proportional to the amount of oligonucleotide present . under the conditions used, sxt-exo digested 13% and 40% of the dt <dig> substrate after  <dig> minutes and  <dig> minutes, respectively . in the corresponding set of reactions, 37% and 63% of the 5'-p-dt <dig> substrate was digested after  <dig> minutes and  <dig> minutes, respectively . this revealed that sxt-exo had a ca.  <dig> - to 3-fold preference for 5'-phosphorylated ends under the conditions tested. it may be noted on both chromatograms, that the height of the shoulder peaks did not concomitantly increase as the main peak decreased, and no additional peaks with longer retention times appeared. this revealed that sxt-exo digested both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the oligothymidine 75-mer without the production of significant amounts of shorter chain length products. this observation is consistent with sxt-exo hydrolyzing ssdna with a certain level of processivity.

to further dissect the dsdna-end preferences of the sxt-exo protein, three  double stranded substrates were created by annealing  complementary pairs of oligonucleotides . one of the annealed oligonucleotides in each substrate was phosphorylated at its 5'-termini and fluorescently-labelled at its 3'-termini with the cy <dig> group . this enabled the digestion of this dna strand to be followed by fluorescence scanning of denaturing polyacrylamide gels . the "blunt ended" substrate comprised a  <dig> bp fully double stranded 'core' region; the "5'-overhang" substrate contained the 'core' dsdna region and a 5'-overhang of  <dig> thymidine residues; and the "3'-overhang" substrate contained a 3'-overhang of  <dig> thymidine residues . the composition of our exonuclease substrates are similar to those previously used by mitsis and kwagh  <cit>  for their characterization of lambda-exo.

sxt-exo  was separately incubated with  <dig> pmol of each of the annealed oligonucleotide substrates at 25°c for  <dig> minutes . aliquots were periodically removed, quenched, and then resolved on denaturing-polyacrylamide gels. gels were fluorescently-scanned, and the intensities of the bands that corresponded to the cy3-labeled oligos were quantified to determine the percentage of substrate digested at each time point . four replicates were performed; and representative gel images are shown in panels a, b and c. standard curves were constructed for both cy3-labelled oligos used, to confirm that their fluorescence intensities were linear over the range of concentrations used . results indicated that sxt-exo digested dna substrates containing 5'-recessed ends  or blunt-ends  with roughly equal efficiencies . both were digested roughly 2-fold more effectively than ones containing 5'-overhangs . furthermore, it may be noted that the intensities of the bands on the gel corresponding to the 5'-phosphorylated-3'-fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides  decreased with increasing time, but their size remained essentially constant. this indicated that this strand of the  duplex was being digested by sxt-exo in the 5'- to 3'-direction, in an apparently processive manner.

analogous sets of experiments were performed with recombinant lambda-exo protein ; except using fewer molar equivalents of enzyme  and a shorter incubation time . lambda-exo digested the dna substrates containing 5'-recessed ends  and blunt-ends  with roughly equal efficiencies . both of these dna substrates were digested roughly twice as effectively as ones containing 5'-overhangs . our findings are entirely consistent with the results reported by mitsis and kwagh  <cit> . taken together, these experiments clearly demonstrated that the lambda-exo and sxt-exo proteins digested this set of  dsdna substrates in an analogous manner; with both proteins exhibiting equivalent substrate preferences.

processivity and rate of double strand dna digestion by sxt-exo
the processivity of the sxt-exo enzyme was determined using a 'heparin trap' method  <cit> . this approach was previously used by myers and co-workers to characterize the processivity of the lambda-exo and spp1-chu proteins  <cit> . a ca. 2000-fold molar excess of sxt-exo trimers was incubated with the linear double stranded dna substrate , to ensure that both termini were saturated. after allowing  <dig> seconds for initiation of reaction, a large excess of heparin was added to sequester all unbound enzyme, to ensure that we were monitoring 'single-binding' digestion events; i.e. determining the average number of nucleotides digested by an 'active' sxt-exo trimer before dissociation. under the conditions employed , the processivity of sxt-exo was estimated to be  <dig> ±  <dig> nucleotides . analogous control experiments were performed  to quantify the dna digested by equivalent amounts of sxt-exo during multiple protein binding events; i.e. including further digestion of partially-digested dna substrates by re-associated sxt-exo trimers. under these conditions  <dig> ±  <dig> nucleotides were digested in  <dig> minutes . as it accurately reflects the digestion of dsdna molecules  by equimolar amounts of sxt-exo protein trimers, the heparin trap data was also used to determine the initial  rate of digestion. fitting the data to a hyperbola  <cit> , the rate of sxt-exo mediated digestion of psti-linearized puc <dig> dna was gauged to be ca.  <dig> nt per second.

protein-mediated modulation of the double stranded dna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo and lambda-exo
further sets of quenched picogreen assays  were used to determine whether the presence of equimolar amounts of the sxt-bet or sxt-ssb proteins had any effects on the rate by which sxt-exo could digest a linear dsdna molecule . bovine serum albumin  was included as a control, as it is commonly found to enhance protein stability in solution , but would not be predicted to exhibit any protein-specific effects with sxt-exo. as may be seen in figure  <dig>  panel a, the presence of sxt-bet or sxt-ssb enhanced the activities of sxt-exo ca.  <dig> -fold or  <dig> -fold, respectively. this may be compared to a ca.  <dig> -fold increase of dsdna exonuclease activities when equimolar amounts of bsa were added. intriguingly, the addition of lambda-bet protein stimulated the activities of sxt-exo nearly 8-fold. analogous experiments were performed using the lambda-exo protein, in place of sxt-exo . similar results were obtained. bsa stimulated the activities of lambda-exo ca.  <dig> -fold, whilst lambda-bet stimulated its activities ca.  <dig> -fold. sxt-bet and sxt-ssb enhanced the dsdna exonuclease activities of lambda-exo ca.  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively. the effects of adding different molar ratios of ssap or ssb proteins to sxt-exo or lambda-exo were not determined.

dna recombination activities of sxt-bet and sxt-exo
in order to evaluate whether the sxt-bet and exo proteins had the combined ability to promote homologous dna recombination, a non-essential gene on the e. coli chromosome  was targeted for allelic replacement with a pcr-generated dsdna chloramphenicol resistance cassette . an analogous approach was previously used by yu et al.  <cit> , to determine the dsdna recombination activities of the lambda-gam-bet-exo proteins , expressed from a modified prophage element in the dy <dig> strain of e. coli. at its 5'-end, the galk<>cmr targeting cassette contains  <dig> bp of sequence homologous to the chromosomal region immediately upstream of the galk gene, and  <dig> bp of sequence at its 3'-end homologous to a region in the galk gene that is slightly upstream of the termination codon .

the lambda-bet-exo, sxt-bet-exo and sxt-ssb-bet-exo genes were analogously expressed from arabinose-inducible plasmids  constructed from pg5p4- <dig> which contains the 'backbone' of the pbad-etγ plasmid  <cit>  . an analogous arabinose-inducible plasmid  containing the multiple cloning site from pet28a in place of a gene encoding a homologous recombination protein was used as a negative control, and pbad-etγ was included as an additional positive control. pbad-etγ contains a gene encoding the functional c-terminal domain of the rece protein under the control of the arabinose-inducible pbad promoter, as well as its partnering rect gene constitutively expressed from a synthetic em <dig> promoter and the lambda-gam gene constitutively expressed from a tn <dig> promoter. plasmids were stably established within the dh10b strain of e. coli, which was selected due to its high electroporation efficiency, and because it does not express the reca recombinase. protein expression was induced by the addition of arabinose to  <dig> %, and transformed strains were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hour to allow sufficient time for the cellular synthesis of the dna recombination proteins, before being made competent for electroporation . the gene targeting efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of chloramphenicol resistant colonies by the total number of cells surviving electroporation . under the conditions tested, lambda-bet-exo  and recet  were found to have approximately equal dsdna homologous recombination efficiencies . the background recombination levels  were extremely low, as dh10b is a reca- strain. the pbex4b <dig>  and pbx2b  plasmids had more than 50-fold lower recombination efficiencies of  <dig> ×10- <dig> and  <dig> ×10- <dig>  respectively. however, this was still more than 300-fold higher than background levels, clearly demonstrating that the sxt-bet and exo proteins functioned together to promote dsdna recombination in e. coli.

discussion
sequence similarities between sxt-exo and related alkaline exonucleases of viral/phage origin
lambda-exo, g <dig> p  and sxt-exo all belong to the lambda exonuclease  superfamily of alkaline exonucleases  <cit> , which is also  referred to as the 'yqaj-like viral recombinase domain' . genes encoding lambda-exo/yqaj homologues are commonly found in the genomes of prokaryotes and prokaryotic mobile genetic elements; often adjacent or proximal to genes encoding single stand dna annealing proteins  and single strand dna binding proteins   <cit> . they fall within the large pd-xk restriction endonuclease superfamily  <cit> , and are phylogenetically and functionally related to alkaline exonucleases from the baculoviridae and herpesviridae families such as: ul <dig> from herpes simplex virus type  <dig>   <cit> ; kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  shut-off and exonuclease  protein  <cit> ; the epstein-barr virus  bglf <dig> exonuclease  <cit> ; and the alkaline nuclease  from the autographa californica multiple-capsid nucleopolyhedrovirus   <cit> . the rece exonuclease from e. coli has minimal sequence homology to lambda exonuclease/yqaj family proteins, even though it has many functional and structural similarities  <cit> .

sxt-exo  and spp1-chu  are notably longer than lambda-exo ; with shared homology, conserved motifs and putative active site residues located within the n-terminal 200aa region  <cit>  . lambda-exo crystallizes as a 'doughnut-shaped' torroidal trimer  <cit> , but recombinant g <dig> p  has been reported to form a dimer in one study  <cit>  and a pentamer or hexamer in another  <cit> . contrastingly, most eukaryotic viral alkaline exonucleases are monomeric and contain additional domains at the n- and c-termini that are involved in protein-protein interactions and dna binding  <cit> . our size exclusion chromatography data  strongly suggests that the active form of sxt-exo is a torroidal trimer that is structurally and functionally analogous to lambda-exo; even though it also shares high levels of sequence homology with spp <dig> g <dig>  , which appears to adopt a quite different multimeric arrangement.

optimal conditions for double strand dna exonuclease activities of the sxt-exo protein
the sxt-exo protein had maximal dsdna exonuclease activities in tris-hcl buffer at a ph of  <dig>  , which is slightly lower, but comparable to, the ph optima of the lambda-exo  and spp1-chu  alkaline exonucleases. whilst lambda-exo and spp1-chu optimally require mg2+ ions for catalytic activities  <cit> , sxt-exo is notably different in its preference for mn2+ ions over mg2+ ions . apart from the increased apparent binding affinity for mn2+ ions, results from our in vitro experiments  indicate that there are no distinguishable differences in substrate preferences or biochemical activities of sxt-exo in the presence of  <dig> mmgcl <dig> or  <dig>  mm mncl2; suggesting that these two ions are functionally interchangeable. in lambda-exo, the asp <dig>  glu <dig> and leu <dig> residues present within motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  are involved in binding the divalent metal ion putatively involved in phosphodiester bond hydrolysis  <cit> . these residues are entirely conserved within sxt-exo; equating to asp <dig>  glu <dig> and leu111; which implies that the catalytic mn2+ or mg2+ ions are bound in an analogous manner. to the best of our knowledge, intracellular manganese and magnesium concentrations within v. cholerae cells have not yet been determined. however, it appears likely that the majority of sxt-exo protein expressed within sxt-infected v. cholerae cells would contain mg2+ ions, due to its presumably far-higher intracellular concentrations.

substrate preferences and mode of digestion
the inability of sxt-exo to digest dsdna molecules that contained phosphorothioate modifications near their 5'-termini, clearly indicated that this protein functions as an exonuclease with strict 5' to 3'-polarity. this is mechanistically-consistent with the finding that the 5'-phosphorylation status of dna substrates strongly affects the efficiency by which they are enzymatically-degraded. sxt-exo digested 5'-phosphorylated dsdna ca. 20-fold more effectively , and 5'-phosphorylated ssdna  <dig> - to 3-fold more effectively  than the corresponding dephosphorylated substrates. it has previously been shown that lambda-exo and g <dig> p  both exhibit similarly-strong preferences for ssdna and dsdna substrates with 5'-phosphorylated ends  <cit> . subramanian et al. revealed that the arg <dig> residue of lambda-exo plays a key role in binding 5'-phosphorylated dna substrates; with the r28a mutant exhibiting an impaired ability to 'recognize' dsdna ends, resulting in far lower levels of exonuclease processvity compared with the wild type enzyme  <cit> . this arginine residue is highly conserved within this class of alkaline exonucleases  <cit> ; corresponding to arg <dig> in sxt-exo and arg <dig> in spp1-chu  <cit>  . the notable inhibitory effects of phosphate and sulfate ions  are consistent with them competing for the protein binding site that accommodates the terminal 5'-phosphate group of dna substrates.

exonucleases may be broadly divided into two functional classes: distributive enzymes that dissociate after removal of a single nucleotide; or processive enzymes that remain bound to the dna chain for a large number catalytic events, or until complete hydrolysis has occurred  <cit> . the heparin-trap experiments revealed that sxt-exo digested dsdna in a highly processive manner; hydrolyzing an average of  <dig> ±  <dig> nucleotides from each terminus before dissociation . its rate of dna hydrolysis was determined to be ca.  <dig> nt/s. the processivity and rate of digestion for sxt-exo reported here are comparable to those previously determined for lambda-exo using bulk scale, solution-based assays: i) a digestion rate of ca.  <dig> nt/s, with a processivity of ca.  <dig> nt  <cit> ; ii) a digestion rate of 4- <dig> nt/s  <cit> ; iii) a processivity of > <dig> nt  <cit> . they are also similar to the figures obtained for the spp1-chu exonuclease: a digestion rate of 2- <dig> nt/s, with a processivity of ca.  <dig> nt  <cit> . this is consistent with these three alkaline exonuclease proteins sharing a common hydrolytic mechanism.

when relatively long linear dsdna substrates  were used as substrates for the sxt-exo protein, the presence of blunt-ends, or short  3'- or 5'-overhangs had little overall influence on the levels of digestion . however, when shorter  substrates were used, which contained considerably longer  3'- or 5'-oligothymidine overhangs; there were notable differences in its relative digestion efficiencies . this suggests that below a certain threshold, the length or type of overhang present at the dna terminus does not significantly affect the binding or 'productive loading' of the exonuclease protein; only the 5'-phosphorylation status is important. as may be seen in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  sxt-exo and lambda-exo exhibited an analogous ca. 2-fold preference for the digestion of 5'-recessed and blunt-ended dna substrates, over ones containing 5'-overhangs. this is fully consistent with the results of mitsis and kwagh, who demonstrated that the rate constants for dna digestion mediated by lambda-exo decreased in the order:  <dig> nt 5'-recessed ends > blunt ends >> <dig> nt 5'-overhangs  <cit> . taken together, our results indicate that the sxt-exo and lambda-exo proteins both process linear dsdna ends in a similar manner, producing the long 3'-ssdna tails that are the substrates for their respective ssap partners.

stimulation of sxt-exo activities by ssap and ssb proteins
it was previously shown that the g35p single strand annealing protein from bacteriophage spp <dig> stimulated the exonuclease activities of its partnering g <dig> p  protein towards dsdna substrates ca. 2- to 5-fold  <cit> . the authors further demonstrated that the g36p single strand binding protein protected ssdna from digestion by g <dig> p. however, they did not investigate whether g36p modulated the dsdna exonucleolytic activities of g <dig> p. here, we found that the sxt-bet, sxt-ssb, lambda-bet and bsa proteins enhanced the dsdna exonuclease activities of both sxt-exo and lambda-exo to differing extents; and none were inhibitory. most notably, the lambda-bet ssap protein stimulated the activities of sxt-exo almost 8-fold, which was substantially higher than the  <dig> -fold stimulation in the presence of sxt-bet . in the reciprocal set of experiments, sxt-bet and lambda-bet stimulated the dsdna exonuclease activities of lambda-exo to a similar extent . the sxt-ssb protein stimulated the activities of sxt-exo  <dig> -fold, which was considerably higher than its  <dig> -fold stimulation of lambda-exo. there appears to be no obvious pattern or trend for the abilities of the ssap and ssb proteins to enhance the activities of the lambda-exo or sxt-exo exonucleases. furthermore, many mechanisms appear plausible: e.g. the ssap or ssb proteins may open up regions of ssdna at the termini of the linear dsdna molecule, thereby facilitating the binding or 'loading' of the torroid-shaped exonuclease trimers. the ssap or ssb proteins may also promote the removal of nascent hairpins, stem-loops or other intra- or inter-strand annealed structures within the partially ssdna molecules produced after an initial digestion event; thereby facilitating exonuclease binding and subsequent digestion. more importantly, it remains to be seen whether these in vitro effects have any direct correlation with the biological activities of the ssb, bet and exo proteins from the sxt, lambda or related viral/phage dna recombination systems; either in their native arrangements, or in alternative permutations.

sxt-exo and sxt-bet promote dna homologous recombination in e. coli cells
we chose to investigate the homologous recombination-promoting activities of sxt-bet/exo using a plasmid-based system in e. coli, as this would enable direct comparison with the well-studied lambda-bet/exo and recet protein pairs. furthermore, as the adjacent sxt-ssb, bet and exo genes have an operon-like arrangement on the sxt genetic element  <cit> , this system presented a straightforward opportunity to investigate the possible involvement of the single strand dna binding protein  protein in the dsdna recombination process. our results indicated that the sxt-bet + sxt-exo proteins  had modest dsdna recombination activity within e. coli; ca. 50-fold less than those of recet  or lambda-bet/exo  under the conditions tested . even though the sxt-ssb protein stimulated the exonuclease activities of sxt-exo in vitro, the additional supply of the sxt-ssb protein  did not enhance the recombination activities of sxt-bet + sxt-exo; it slightly reduced them.

datta et al. previously reported that the oligonucleotide-directed dna recombination activities of the sxt-bet protein were comparable to those of lambda-bet and rect  <cit>  in e. coli. taken together with our findings, this suggests that the activities or biophysical properties of sxt-exo may be limiting the combined dsdna recombination activities of the sx-bet/exo protein pair. it is possible that the intracellular environment of e. coli may not be conducive to optimal sxt-exo activities, whilst sxt-bet can function quite efficiently. this may be related to the fact that sxt-bet shares significantly higher levels of amino acid identity with lambda-bet  than sxt-exo shares with lambda-exo . e. coli is the native host for the recet and lambda-bet/exo proteins, but the sxt/r <dig> family of ices infect entirely different species of gamma-proteobacteria . consequently, they may be optimized for activity within quite different bacterial hosts. interestingly, datta et al.  <cit>  further reported that all  <dig> pairs of ssap and exo proteins tested in e. coli  had dsdna recombination activities that were >1000-fold less than those of lambda-bet/exo . however the orfc, plu <dig> and orf <dig> ssap proteins all had ssdna recombination activities comparable to those of rect or lambda-bet. this suggests that for  <dig> out of  <dig> sets of proteins tested, the exonuclease protein may the cause of the low dsdna recombination activities.

yamamoto et al. recently reported that the lambda-bet/exo proteins  were capable of mediating homologous recombination between pcr-generated dsdna fragments and the v. cholerae chromosome  <cit> . their results indicated that the recombination efficiencies of lambda-bet/exo in v. cholerae cells were more than 100-fold less than in e. coli  <cit>  and required  <dig> nt or longer flanking regions of homology on the dsdna 'targeting cassettes'. these reduced efficiencies may be due to degradation of the introduced pcr fragments by host cell nucleases  <cit> , or may reflect the reduced functional activities of the lambda-bet/exo proteins within v. cholerae. it would be extremely interesting to investigate the efficiency of the sxt-bet + sxt-exo proteins using similar approaches in v. cholerae cells; especially within nuclease-deficient strains more amenable to  dna transformation  <cit> , to see if these systems were better suited for recombineering approaches in this species.

biological and mechanistic implications of our findings
taken together with previous findings, our results are consistent with the following mode of activity . a trimer of sxt-exo proteins bind to the terminus of a linear dsdna molecule: e.g. a 'broken' ice molecule or host chromosomal double strand break , in a process that is facilitated by the presence of a 5'-phosphate group  <cit> . in the presence of mn2+ or mg2+ ions, the sxt-exo trimer then digests one dna strand in a highly processive manner from its 5'-terminus towards its 3'-end, whilst translocating along the complementary 3'-strand like a 'bead on a string'  <cit> . the long 3'-ssdna overhangs formed are coated by the partnering sxt-bet protein, forming helical nucleoprotein filaments  <cit> . these nucleofilaments associate with regions of homologous dsdna on the host chromosome or viral genetic element, and mediate strand annealing, strand exchange and possibly strand invasion  <cit> . as sxt-exo has no detectable nicking or endonuclease activities, the fully circularized double stranded or single stranded extrachromosomal forms of sxt  will not act as substrates in the absence of existing dna breaks, or without the actions of host restriction endonucleases  <cit> . the ssdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo may play a role in dna 'strand assimilation', by 'trimming off' redundant ssdna strands formed after the formation of joint dna intermediates  <cit> . furthermore, our finding that recombinant sxt-exo cannot cleave circularized ssdna indicates that it does not modify the circular single stranded form of sxt dna that is the substrate for conjugative transfer from donor to recipient cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the s <dig> sxt-exo protein has both single strand and double strand dna exonuclease activities, but no detectable endonuclease or nicking activities. adopting a stable trimeric arrangement in solution, the dsdna exonuclease activities of sxt-exo are optimal at ph <dig>  in the presence of  <dig>  mm mn2+ ions; and are substantially enhanced in the presence of ssap and ssb proteins. analogous to lambda-exo, sxt-exo degrades linear dsdna with 5'- to 3'-polarity, digesting substrates containing 5'-phosphate groups with high processivity. the sxt-exo and sxt-bet  proteins functioned together to promote homologous recombination events in e. coli cells, with an efficiency that was ca. 50-fold lower than that of lambda-bet/exo or recet under the conditions tested.

schematic overview of exo and ssap-mediated recombination between two linear double stranded dna molecules sharing sequence homology near their respective termini. one strand from each of the two linear dna molecules is digested in a processive manner from its 5'-terminus by the alkaline exonuclease protein , generating long 3'-single stranded dna  'tails'. the partnering single strand annealing protein  coats these long ssdna tails, forming helical protein nucleofilaments. the ssap mediates annealing of the 3'-ssdna-nucleofilament tail with a complementary region of ssdna on the other resected dna molecule . here, the torroidal trimer of exo protein is shown to dissociate from the non-digested strand, although this may not necessarily be the case. the ssap mediates displacement of the original complementary strand, and promotes annealing of the  complementary strand from the other dna molecule until its 3'-terminus, or until the end of its sequence homology. any 3'-ssdna overhangs would not be digested by exo, but by a host exonuclease with 3'-5' ssdna exonuclease activity . the exo protein 'trims' both the 5'-ssdna overhangs via its ssdna exonucleolytic activity, until only a nick remains, which is sealed by host dna ligase.
