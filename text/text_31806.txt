BACKGROUND
alkaline phosphatases , which is essential in bone mineralization and functions in vascular calcification  <cit> , is a group of hydrolytic isoenzymes with low substrate specificity that catalyze the hydrolysis of organic phosphate esters at an alkaline environment  <cit> . four genes encode alp, including tissue-nonspecific alp gene located on 1p <dig> , which is expressed in various tissues such as osteoblasts, hepatocytes, kidney and early placenta; and three tissue-specific alp genes located on 2q <dig>  which are expressed in placenta, germ cells, and intestine, respectively  <cit> . in healthy individuals, serum alp derives mostly from liver/bone/kidney, partially from intestine especially during postprandial time or in blood type o or b secretors, and little is contributed from placenta in the third trimester of pregnancy  <cit> . the concentration of serum alp is elevated in pathological conditions like osteoblast activated bone disorders, bile-flow obstructions, tumor metastases, liver diseases, leukemia, hyperthyroidism, infections and obesity, while lower level occurs in anemia and hypothyroidism  <cit> . current evidence demonstrated that elevated serum alp levels were associated with adverse outcomes of dialysis patients and increased all-cause death rate in myocardial infraction survivors  <cit> . in particular, positive associations between alp levels and all-cause death rate together with cardiovascular mortality were also observed in the general population  <cit> . therefore, investigating the underlying factors that influence serum alp levels are meaningful for both clinical medicine and public health.

serum alp is a complex trait influenced by both polygenic and environmental factors. it is reported that age, gender, smoking, diet, body mass index , and physical activities could affect serum alp concentrations  <cit> . the additive genetic heritability of serum alp in mice is approximately 56%  <cit> . recent gwas have identified several loci, including nbpf3-alpl, abcb <dig>  gpld <dig>  ppp1r3b, trib <dig>  abo, jmjd1c, reep <dig>  fads <dig>  pmfbp <dig>  dlg <dig>  fut <dig> and abhd <dig>  associated with serum alp levels in european ancestry populations, asian-indians and japanese populations  <cit> , however, such researches in populations of chinese origin are limited, and no study investigated gene-environment interactions on serum alp levels. in the present study, we performed a gwas in  <dig>  subjects and replicated the top snps in additional  <dig>  healthy chinese han individuals. the purposes of the study were to  detect genetic determinants for serum alp in chinese han population;  compare the present results with published findings to seek heterogeneity among chinese and other populations and  investigate the gene-environment interactions on serum alp levels.

RESULTS
characteristics of the study population
a total of  <dig>  subjects  were included in the discovery set with a mean  serum alp concentration of  <dig>   u/l; validation were conducted in  <dig>  individuals  whose mean  serum alp concentration was  <dig>   u/l. the demographics of the study population together with information on potential influencing factors of serum alp are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

association with alkaline phosphatase level
in gwas stage, a total of  <dig>  snps were genotyped among  <dig>  subjects in which  <dig>  snps not mapped on autosomes were excluded. after qc filtering, snps with minor allele frequency  <  <dig> , hardy-weinberg equilibrium  <  <dig> , and snps call rate < 95% were excluded. individuals with a call rate < 95% were also ruled out for further analysis. finally,  <dig>  subjects with  <dig>  autosomal snps were retained for association analyses, with an overall call rate of  <dig> %. quantile - quantile plot revealed a good match between the distributions of the observed p values and those expected by chance, and a genomic inflation factor of  <dig>  suggested that population stratification effects were negligible in our study samples . the manhattan plot showed that 2p <dig>  , 2p <dig>  , 9q <dig>   and 17q <dig>   were associated with serum alp at  <dig>  × 10- <dig> significance level . the regional association plot revealed the snp-alp associations and linkage disequilibrium  relations on 9q <dig>  . the present study has  <dig> % power to detect snps that account for 2% of the alp variance at 5 × 10- <dig> significance level; however, it has only  <dig> % power to detect snps at 5 × 10- <dig> significance level, hence 5 × 10- <dig> was set to be the cutoff point in snp selection. seven snps met the selection criteria . among them, rs <dig> on 9q <dig> , which has been reported to be associated with alp in european and japanese population  <cit> , was replicated with a p value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in our gwas set. therefore, we did not validate this snp in the second stage. the other  <dig> snps were selected for further validation.

agenome position is based on ncbi build  <dig> .

bthe p values in gwas stage are based on linear regression analysis on the log-transformed alp with adjustment for age, gender and the top two eigenvectors in pca analysis assuming an additive model by plink. the validation and combined p values are calculated by linear regression model on the log-transformed alp and adjusted for age and gender.

*snps of rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> were validated in  <dig>  healthy participants, while rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> were validated in  <dig>  participants.

three snps located within or near the abo locus showed significant association with serum alp in validation population  . using each snp as a covariate, we performed conditional analysis on the remaining  <dig> snps for their association with serum alp. the results revealed that rs <dig> was associated with serum alp levels  independently of the other two snps, and it accounted for  <dig> % of the total variance of serum alp . a significant difference in alp levels among different genetic-inferred abo blood groups was observed in gwas dataset , similar to previous reports  <cit> . to further explore whether the effect of the lead snp rs <dig> was driven by abo blood group, we introduced abo blood group into the multivariable linear regression model. as expected, the association between alp levels and rs <dig> dramatically reduced after abo blood group adjustment. . other three loci that mapped on 2p <dig>  , 2p <dig>   and 17q <dig>   failed to be replicated . the unbalanced distribution of the demographic characteristics in the discovery and replication samples in the present study might partly contribute to the lack of replication.

genetic heterogeneity on alp levels among studies
gwas results of the present study were compared with previously published studies that conducted in populations of european and japanese origins  <cit>  . although abo locus found in other populations has been replicated in the present study, other loci identified in one or two earlier studies failed to be replicated. we did not observe positive signals on alpl or gpld <dig>  which has been reported in european and japanese studies . many loci identified in populations of european origin, e.g. abcb <dig>  ppp1r3b, c9orf <dig>  reep <dig>  st3gal <dig> and abhd <dig>  are neither significant in japanese populations nor in our population although some of them got comparable effect sizes across studies . only rs <dig>  which mapped on an intergenic region on chromosome  <dig>  has been identified in japanese population with no significant signals around the locus being seen in european or in the present study. the heterogeneity test showed considerable heterogeneity across studies for some snps , which may attribute to ethnic heterogeneity and differences in characteristics of samples and study designs, etc. the small sample size also limited the power of the present study to replicate snps with low maf and/or minor effects .

ain order to get genotypes of all reported snps, imputed genotype data were used in the presented ethnic comparison table. eaf is short for effect allele frequency.

gene-environment interaction analysis
multiple factors have been proved to influence serum alp levels, including age, gender, bmi, smoking, drinking and physical activity  <cit> . therefore, we tested whether the independent snp rs <dig> interacted with age, gender, bmi , smoking or drinking on affecting alp concentrations. as shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  rs <dig> had a significant interaction with overweight and obesity on serum alp levels . for gg genotype carriers, the mean of serum alp were similar between those with normal weight and those who were overweight or obese ; ga or aa genotype carriers have significantly decreased serum alp concentrations compared with gg genotype carriers; however, this effect was attenuated in overweight or obese individuals . thus, among aa genotype carriers, overweight or obese individuals had higher alp levels than those with normal weight  . the statistic power of interaction analysis in the present study is  <dig> %. no significant gene-environment interactions were observed between rs <dig> and other factors including age, gender, drinking, and smoking .

discussion
in the present two-stage gwas, we confirmed that previously identified locus abo was associated with serum alp levels in a chinese population. when comparing the present study with previously published findings, ethnic differences were observed across populations. in addition, a significant interaction between overweight and obesity and abo rs <dig> on serum alp was found. the effects of rs <dig> on serum alp levels were attenuated in overweight or obese individuals than in normal weight subjects.

the association between abo locus and serum alp has been reported in other populations  <cit> . the present study was consistent with previous findings that serum alp levels are much higher in individuals with blood type b or o  <cit> ; the lead snp rs <dig> on abo locus, which is in high ld with previously reported rs <dig> , accounted for  <dig> % of the total variance of serum alp in our population, similar with that reported in earlier studies   <cit> . the coding product of human abo gene is a glycosyltransferase, of which catalytic activity could facilitate the transfer of carbohytrates to h antigen to form the antigenic structure of the abo blood groups  <cit> . current evidence found that human abo blood groups or genetic variations on abo gene were associated with the risk of various diseases, such as pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, falciparum malaria, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . genetic variations on abo gene were also found to be related with levels of serum e-selectin, sicam, rbc, hb, vwf, and cea  <cit> . in healthy fasted individuals, approximately 90% of serum alp originate from liver/bone/kidney, nearly 10% from intestine and in some cases 1% from placenta  <cit> . most of the intestinal alp is attached to abo antigens on the surface of erythrocytes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. erythrocytes of blood type a bind to almost all intestinal alp, while erythrocytes of blood type b/o bind to a much lesser degree, therefore results in a more prevalent presence of intestinal alp in serum in individuals with blood type b/o  <cit> . in this sense, the differences in the binding capacity between intestinal alp and erythrocytes among individuals with different blood groups might be a potential mechanism underlying the association between alp and abo locus identified in gwas. the observation that association between rs <dig> and serum alp dramatically reduced after abo blood group adjustment also lend support to this deduction, indicating that abo blood groups may act as the driving force behind this association.

differences were observed among studies when comparing our findings with previously published results and parts of the reason might be due to the ethnic heterogeneity, such as varied effect allele frequencies and unique ld structures. for example, the maf of rs <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in europeans, chinese and japanese, respectively; the maf of rs <dig> on gpld <dig> locus is  <dig>  in european but is only  <dig>  in chinese han, and even lower,  <dig>  in japanese; the scenario is the same for rs <dig> on abhd <dig> that its effect allele frequency is  <dig>  in european but is only  <dig>  in chinese. on the contrary, rs <dig> has a maf of  <dig>  in european but the frequency of this effective allele is  <dig>  in chinese. meanwhile, not all abo snps identified in europeans are significant in chinese, which may partially due to the differences in ld structure, e.g. the ld relation between rs <dig> and rs <dig> on abo gene is weak in asian populations, but get stronger in europeans . unique population structures, including different modifier genes, gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, different lifestyles or environment exposures can also be explanations for the heterogeneity across populations  <cit> . notably, although it showed no evidence for heterogeneity across studies for snps on abcb <dig>  ppp1r3b, c9orf <dig>  jmjd1c, reep <dig>  st3gal <dig>  and abhd <dig>  snps on alpl, gpld <dig>  pmfbp <dig> and fut <dig> represented considerable heterogeneity among studies. the lack of replication of many loci may also due to different sample selection criteria, different study designs and statistical analysis methods, as well as the relatively small sample size of the gwas stage of the present study. studies with larger sample size, different ethnic sources and multi-center cooperations are needed to explain the ethnic differences better.

previous study found that serum alp was higher in obese patients  <cit> . the interaction between rs <dig> and overweight and obesity on alp levels found in the present study may be one of the explanations. the effect of rs <dig> on serum alp was attenuated in overweight or obese individuals compared with normal weight subjects, resulting in higher alp levels in overweight or obese individuals. eqtl analysis  <cit>  showed that rs <dig> could trans-regulate the expression of tnfrsf1a ; meanwhile, rs <dig> was observed associated to higher serum tnf-r <dig> levels in a previous study  <cit> , demonstrating that rs <dig> may be involved in the regulation of tnf receptors. in addition, tnf signaling is believed playing an important role in obesity since tnfα mrna or protein was found overexpressed in obese subjects in both experimental and epidemiological studies. researchers also found that tnf signaling plays an important role in the insulin resistance of obesity  <cit> . moreover, tnf-α has been demostrated to positively regulate alp levels in various types of cells  <cit> . taken together, all evidence suggests that the interaction between rs <dig> and overweight and obesity on serum alp levels may act through the regulation of tnf system. further studies are needed to uncover the real mechanism of the interaction.

our study are not only consistent with findings of previous gwa studies  <cit> , but also in line with early reports that serum alp levels varied in individuals with different abo blood types  <cit> , however, it is undeniable that the relatively small sample size of our gwas stage limited us to detect snps with minor effects and snps with low maf, which calls for further large sample size studies and consortium cooperation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study confirmed that abo locus was a major determinant for serum alp levels in chinese han population. when comparing the present study with previously published findings, ethnic differences were observed across populations. more importantly, we found that overweight and obesity could modify the effects of abo rs <dig> polymorphism on serum alp levels. findings herein may furnish clinical application in prognosis control. further studies are warranted to validate our findings and explore the potential mechanisms.
