BACKGROUND
the development and commercialization of next-generation massively parallel dna sequencing approaches, by dramatically decreasing the cost of sequencing, have revolutionized genomic research. the main innovation of ngs, as compared to sanger sequencing, is the parallelisation of the process, allowing between a few thousands and up to millions of sequencing reactions to be processed simultaneously. the three main ngs technologies available on the market use different approaches for library construction, template immobilisation and sequencing reaction, but the basic principles remain the same. ngs approaches also have some drawbacks compared with sanger sequencing:  sequence reads produced currently by ngs  are shorter than sanger sequencing reads  and have a higher error rate, making the sequence assembly more problematic;  the pairing of reads in sanger sequencing is limited by the size of the dna fragments that can be inserted in cloning vectors, ranging from 1– <dig> kb or less up to 100– <dig> kb , whereas pairing of reads is limited to  <dig> kb with ngs, limiting the average assembled scaffold length and leading to more difficulty in segmental duplication and copy number variation detection;  as a consequence, a higher sequencing depth is required for assembly and a very high number of small scaffolds are produced. nevertheless, the sequencing and de novo assembly of a chinese individual  <cit>  proved the feasibility of sequencing and assembling whole genomes by ngs. many species have been sequenced and/or resequenced by ngs, such as the giant panda ailuropoda melanoleura <cit> , the silk worm bombyx mori <cit> , the cucumber cucumis sativus <cit> , the chicken gallus gallus domesticus <cit> , the turkey meleagris gallopavo <cit>  and the mallard duck anas platyrhybchos domesticus .

the pekin duck  is an obvious target for detailed genomic studies due to its agricultural importance  <cit>  as well as for its role as a natural reservoir of all influenza a viruses. it can usually carry the infection with no sign of disease and thus propagates the virus to other bird species and potentially to mammals such as pigs or humans  <cit> . the duck genome presents most of the characteristics encountered in birds, which are:  a more compact genome, one third the size of a typical mammalian one,  a large number of chromosomes ,  the presence of macrochromosomes and microchromosomes, the latter being as small as a few mb  <cit>  and  the females are the heterogametic sex  and males the homogametic one . due to its importance both in the economic and scientific fields, the sequencing of the pekin duck genome was initiated in  <dig> using the same strategy recently published for the giant panda  <cit>  at the beijing genomics institute . the sequence reads provided a depth of 65x and a total of  <dig>  scaffolds were assembled in which the n <dig> scaffold was  <dig>  mb and the largest was  <dig>  mb in length . however, owing to the lack of a clone-based physical map and other supplementary mapping data, apart from a first generation genetic map composed of  <dig> microsatellite markers,  <dig> of which located in only  <dig> linkage groups spanning  <dig>  cm  <cit> , it is possible to assign only very few assembled scaffolds to chromosomes.

several studies have shown that birds seem to have a slower rate of chromosome rearrangements than mammals, with only very little inter-chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . between chicken and zebra finch, whole genome comparisons revealed  <dig> tentative intrachromosomal rearrangements  in which some were confirmed by fish  experiments  <cit> . recently, zhang et al.  provided confirmed evidence for 20– <dig> major rearrangements between turkey and chicken, almost all of which are inversions  <cit> . the mean reported phylogenetic distance between chicken and turkey is  <dig> million years, whereas it is  <dig> between chicken and duck  <cit> , so the number or rearrangements reported between chicken and turkey provide the minimum level of difference expected between chicken and duck. to date, only one interchromosomal difference has been reported between the chicken and the duck karyotypes, with apl <dig> and apl <dig> corresponding to gga4q and gga4p respectively  <cit> . this interchromosomal rearrangement explains the difference in diploid chromosomal number between the two species, which is 2n =  <dig> in chicken and 2n =  <dig> in duck and therefore the nomenclature for numbering the duck chromosomes follows mainly that of chicken. macrochromosomes apl <dig> to apl <dig> correspond to gga <dig> to gga <dig>  then apl <dig> corresponds to gga4p and finally, the rest of the karyotype is offset by one, with gga <dig> corresponding to apl <dig> and so on. cross-species fluorescent in-situ hybridization  studies using chicken bac clones on duck metaphase spreads showed only a few large scale intrachromosomal rearrangements concerning the largest chromosomes  <cit> . all this demonstrates a high karyotype stability despite  <dig> million years of divergence between the two species  <cit> .

as a first attempt to order the duck sequence scaffolds, we aligned the  <dig>  ones larger than  <dig> kb to the current chicken assembly using the narcisse database  <cit>  and successfully positioned  <dig>  of them. this still leaves a large number of scaffolds to assign and also means that the ordering of the duck scaffolds and genes we obtained will follow the chicken genome and will be wrong whenever large- or small-scale rearrangements will have happened between the two species.

to assemble the scaffolds in an order corresponding to the real duck chromosomes, several approaches can be used. high density snp genetic maps allow high precision in mapping. however, the snp markers need first to be discovered by a sequencing approach, such as published by kraus et al.   <cit>  and must be informative in a reference population to be used for mapping. however, despite several thousand snp discovered to date  <cit> , only a small subset of  <dig> were genotyped  <cit> , mainly due to the high cost that would have been required for additional markers. finally, out of these, only a small subset was informative in mapping populations , which will allow only for low resolution maps and poor marker ordering. furthermore, for high precision mapping, very large populations counting several hundred individuals are required, yet again increasing cost and labour. further sequencing for snp detection and a consortium for generating a snp chip would help improve genetic maps in duck and may happen in the future. physical maps can be based on the mapping of bac clones by fish for chromosome assignment and large-scale ordering. the bac clones from large libraries can be used for contig construction by fingerprinting or high throughput hybridization. end-sequencing of the clones allow linking sequence scaffolds together. bac contig maps are thus usually a backbone to the sequence assembly. a bac library has been made for duck  <cit> , but to the best of our knowledge, there are no plans yet to build physical maps. in this context, radiation hybrid mapping can be an excellent complementary mapping approach, as it does not require complex marker development and large-scale genotyping. any sts can be placed on the map by simple pcr on as little as  <dig> hybrids. thus with a minimal effort, maps with a resolution intermediate between the genetic and the bac contig maps can be constructed to propose a correct chromosomal assignment and ordering of scaffolds. we report here the production of a duck whole genome radiation hybrid panel and demonstrate its utility to verify the quality of sequence scaffolds and for assigning and positioning scaffolds onto chromosomes. large-scale culture of radiation hybrid clones is a time-consuming process and moreover causes the loss of donor fragments in the hybrids. to avoid the necessity of cultivating the radiation hybrid clones at a large scale, we tested three approaches. one involves whole genome amplification  and conventional genotyping by pcr and gel electrophoresis and the other two use minute amounts of dna and fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm genotyping by quantitative pcr. the advantage of the fluidigm approaches is low cost combined with simple and rapid high-scale genotyping.

RESULTS
generation and characterisation of a duck radiation hybrid panel
duck radiation hybrids were obtained by fusing female duck embryonic fibroblasts irradiated at a dose of  <dig>  rads, with hprt-deficient hamster cells from the wg3hcl <dig> cell line. five fusion experiments were carried out to produce  <dig> duck radiation hybrids, suggesting that one hybrid clone was recovered per  <dig>  duck fibroblasts, corresponding to an average fusion efficiency of  <dig>  x 10- <dig> clone per duck fibroblast. retention frequencies in the hybrids were estimated by using a set of  <dig> microsatellite markers distributed along the duck genome, whose positions were estimated on the basis of a low resolution genetic map . genotyping was performed by conventional pcr followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. as the ancestral chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  fused in chicken to give gga4q and gga4p respectively, remain separated in duck as apl <dig> and apl <dig>  <cit> , care was taken to choose one marker located on apl <dig> and  <dig> others on apl <dig>  as microchromosomes and the regions close to centromeres were reported to be better retained in chicken radiation hybrids  <cit> , we decided to focus more on macrochromosomes and use a higher proportion of markers from macrochromosomes. altogether,  <dig> markers from macrochromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> and chromosome z were selected and the rest  were from identified microchromosomes. by using the genetic maps and comparative mapping with chicken, we avoided the clustering of markers.

as a result from genotyping, we estimated the average retention frequency of duck genome fragments in the  <dig> hybrids to be  <dig> % for the whole genome, with unequal values for macrochromosomes  and microchromosomes . previous estimations showed that a panel of  <dig> hybrids with marker retention frequencies between  <dig> and 50% are sufficient to build maps of chromosomes at a reasonable resolution  <cit> . almost 50% of our duck-hamster hybrids have an average retention frequency over 15%, being thus potential candidates for the final panel. finally, the  <dig> hybrids selected for the definitive panel were chosen with the highest possible marker retentions for macrochromosomes while maintaining good values for microchromosomes. final retention frequency values are  <dig> % genome-wide, with specific values of  <dig> % for the macrochromosomes and  <dig> % for the microchromosomes.

testing three different rh strategies for mapping macrochromosomes and medium size microchromosomes
several thousand markers are needed to build genome-wide maps, requiring large amounts of dna, usually prepared by large-scale culture of the radiation hybrid clones. however, this is a time-consuming task and moreover, donor chromosome fragments are lost during the culture process. to avoid this, we tested three alternative methods allowing minute amounts of dna from the hybrids to be used. these were based either on whole genome amplification  by multiple displacement amplification  of the dna from the hybrid clones and/or on scaling down the pcr to  <dig> nl, allowing the dna requirements to be as little as  <dig> pg, by using the fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm genotyping by quantitative pcr   <cit> . the three conditions were thus:  wga-pcr, in which the dna from the hybrid clones was amplified by wga and the genotyping performed by conventional pcr followed by agarose gel electrophoresis;  wga-fldmqpcr, in which the wga-amplified dna was used for genotyping by quantitative real-time pcr in  <dig> nl reaction volumes and  pre-ampfldmqpcr, in which the dna from the clones was used directly without wga, which was replaced by a more specific pre-amplification step using the  <dig> primer pairs for the  <dig> loci studied in one fluidigm biomarktm run .

whole genome amplifications with mda were performed for all the  <dig> selected radiation hybrids. each sample was amplified in three replicates which were pooled together to avoid representation bias in the final working panel. we obtained a  <dig> x amplification efficiency, with more than  <dig> μg of wga-dna obtained for each hybrid, from  <dig> ng of starting dna. as the smallest microchromosomes have always proved difficult to sequence and to clone in chicken, we supposed a bias could also exist for wga. to check for correct amplification of microchromosomes, we designed markers from two scaffolds located on apl <dig>  orthologous to gga <dig> and containing the two major histocompatibility complex  gene clusters and the nucleolar organizing region  rrna genes, and from two scaffolds located on apl <dig>  according to comparative genomic data given by the narcisse database  <cit> . these  <dig> markers were added to our first set of  <dig> microsatellite markers we used primarily for selecting the  <dig> clones for the panel. genotyping this set of markers on the wga-dna of the  <dig> hybrids demonstrated average retention frequencies of  <dig> % for the whole genome, with  <dig> % for the macrochromosomes and  <dig> % for the microchromosomes. on average, retention frequencies are very close to those observed before the wga . however, retention frequency of s <dig> located on apl <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> located on apl <dig> were increased after wga, especially for s <dig>  in contrast, a slight retention loss was found for s <dig>  the other scaffold marker from apl <dig>  thus amplifying the panel by wga and genotyping by the conventional pcr and agarose gel electrophoresis approach  appears to be a good option for mapping without having to perform large-scale culture of the hybrids, at least for macrochromosomes and medium-sized microchromosomes.

however, genotyping several thousand markers by individual pcr and gel electrophoresis would require a lot of time and effort and a higher throughput method would be more appropriate, if feasible. in addition to scaling down pcr volumes and reducing required dna amounts, the fluidigm biomarktm has the added benefit of allowing rapid testing of  <dig> markers on  <dig> samples. to compare fluidigm biomarktm genotyping by qrt-pcr, with  or without  wga of the radiation hybrid dna , with our more usual pcr and agarose  method, we used a set of  <dig> markers designed from scaffolds of the duck genome assembly. results shown in figure 1b suggest differences in retention frequencies between the three methods for the  <dig> markers tested, with lower values for the wga-fldmqpcr method. differences in marker retention between the three methods were estimated by multiple t-tests , suggesting that there was no significant difference between the wga-pcr and the pre-ampfldmqpcr methods, whereas the wga-fldmqpcr genotyping results were significantly different from the two others, with markedly lower retentions. these lower retentions values found with the wga-fldmqpcr condition are probably due to a lower sensitivity of the method, when compared to the pre-ampfldmqpcr condition . taken together, our results suggest that our genotyping method by qpcr using the fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm should not be performed using wga dna and also that if wga dna can be used for genotyping macrochromosome markers by the conventional agarose technique, it may cause problems for the smallest microchromosomes, as suggested by the results from the two markers on apl <dig>

to investigate further the possibility of using the pre-ampfldmqpcr method for genotyping, we constructed a map for a medium-size microchromosome , in addition to a first map of apl <dig> constructed by conventional pcr and agarose genotyping.

rh mapping of apl <dig> by wga-pcr
twenty-four scaffold markers derived from  <dig> duck scaffolds aligned to gga <dig> in the narcisse database  and designed as described in the material and methods section, were genotyped on wga dna by conventional pcr and gel electrophoresis. to build a rh map of microchromosome apl <dig>  two methods were used: one using the carthagene software with the usual method  <cit>  and a second using a comparative approach based on the chicken genome, and the construction of a robust map . by the classical carthagene approach,  <dig> markers were included in a single linkage group with a lod score threshold of  <dig>  and a framework map containing  <dig> markers and spanning  <dig> cr was obtained. however, five of the comprehensive map markers might extend the current map length by  <dig> cr and the most likely position for all framework and non-framework markers given by the carthagene software  <cit>  are indicated in italics on the apl <dig> rh map . the comparative mapping approach and the associated robust map construction produced a map  <dig> cr long, containing  <dig> robust markers . the average retention frequency for the markers is  <dig> %, in accordance with microchromosome retention frequency of the panel. a maximum marker retention around marker sca246b, suggests the centromere could be in that region , which would be compatible with an acrocentric microchromosome. comparative mapping with chicken chromosome gga <dig> suggests several intrachromosomal rearrangements within this microchromosome.

rh mapping of apl <dig> by pre-ampfldmqpcr
genotyping data for ten apl <dig> microsatellites and thirty-one markers designed from  <dig> scaffolds aligned to gga <dig> were successfully obtained using the pre-ampfldmqpcr method and used to generate a rh map by the classical approach with the carthagene software  <cit>  and by the comparative mapping approach. after two-point analysis at a lod threshold of  <dig>  three linkage groups were defined among which the largest one contained  <dig> markers. the order of the  <dig> markers from the largest linkage group was determined by multipoint analysis with carthagene and a framework map of apl <dig> bearing eighteen markers was obtained. the framework map is composed of  <dig> markers, covers  <dig> cr <dig> and twenty additional markers on the comprehensive map extend the current map length by  <dig> cr . the map obtained by the comparative mapping approach is  <dig> cr long. the average retention for the markers on apl <dig> is 46%, significantly higher than the average microchromosome retention. as a result, the whole chromosome has a relatively high retention rate and no position for the centromeric region can be suggested from the rh map.

only one major intrachromosomal rearrangement is observed when comparing apl <dig> to chicken chromosome gga <dig>  one additional minor inversion is observed only when comparing gga <dig> with the map of apl <dig> built with the classical carthagene approach. the major inversion was tested and confirmed by fish mapping using bac clones located at both ends of the inverted fragment and corresponding to the regions of scaffold <dig> and scaffold <dig> . fish results confirm the inversion .

rh mapping of no hit est markers from the smallest microchromosomes
next, we wanted to test the three genotyping methods for mapping the smallest microchromosomes, orthologous to those absent from the current chicken sequence assembly and maps. we previously reported a strategy for mapping genes on the smallest microchromosomes absent from the chicken genome assembly  <cit> . chicken est contigs with sequence similarity to the human genome and showing no blast hit in the chicken genome were selected to develop pcr markers. most of these markers, which we named the no hit markers , were found to cluster in specific regions of the human genome, likely corresponding to conserved syntenies missing in chicken and corresponding to the missing microchromosomes  <cit> .

to increase chances of our markers showing linkage in duck, we focused marker development on duck est contig sequence having sequence similarity to hsa <dig>  in a region that was already shown to have synteny conservation with some of the smallest chicken chromosomes and being absent in the chicken genome assembly  <cit> . due to the limited amount of duck est data available, we were able to design only eight such markers derived from duck est contig data showing no significant blast hits with the current chicken assembly  but with sequence similarity to human chromosome hsa <dig> . these were genotyped by all three techniques. genotyping results for these eight no hit to chicken markers are showed in table  <dig>  suggesting wga has a much lower efficiency for the smallest microchromosomes, especially when used in combination with the fldm method, leading to the underrepresentation  or even to the total loss of the corresponding mapping data. for instance, the genotyping results of the  <dig> no hit markers showed that some regions like the fragment spanned by marker estctg <dig> are not amplified by wga because no positive signal was observed both in amplified hybrid dna or in amplified duck genome dna, whereas the remaining seven markers have a very low average retention: 5% in wga-fldmqpcr and 12% in wga-pcr, compared to 34% for pre-ampfldmqpcr. the latter method seems thus the only one suited for mapping the smallest microchromosomes.

the  <dig> no hit markers were genotyped using either of three methods :  wga-pcr: the wga-amplified panel and conventional agarose genotyping;  wga-fldmqpcr: the wga-amplified panel and genotyping with the fluidigm biomark gene expression dynamic array, without the pre-amplification with a mix of all primer pairs or  pre-ampfldmqpcr: the non-amplified panel and genotyping with the fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm with a pre-amplification step using a mix of all primer pairs. 1wga duck: wga-amplified duck genomic dna as positive control; 2duck: duck genomic dna as positive control; 3no. pos: number of hybrids positive for the assay ;  <dig> nb. controls: total number of controls which are positive over the number of controls tested; 5mean pos: mean number of positive hybrids observed over the whole panel; na: not applicable.

analysis of the results with carthagene showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> markers: estctg <dig>  estctg <dig>  yo3g5xe <dig> and estctg <dig> are linked together and define a region of conserved synteny with hsa <dig> and gga <dig>  and corresponds thus to apl <dig>  the duck marker estctg <dig> labels the gene ckm which is located very close to human genes bckdha, snrpa, mrps <dig> and psmd <dig> which were shown to be on gga <dig>  this suggests that estctg <dig> could be located on duck chromosome apl <dig> 

testing scaffold assembly
to test the quality of scaffold assembly, we selected the  <dig> largest duck scaffolds whose length ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and designed  <dig> markers with a density of one marker every megabase. these  <dig> markers were genotyped by pre-ampfldmqpcr and the results allowed the detection of one possible misassembly in scaffold <dig>  for which a marker located at one end showed no linkage with the others. results for all the scaffolds are showed in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

to further test scaffolds from the duck genome assembly, we screened for potential chimeras by comparative mapping and detected using narcisse  <cit> ,  <dig> duck scaffolds each of which mapping to two chicken chromosomes . as no inter-chromosomal rearrangements have been described to date between duck and chicken, we suspected assembly errors could have occurred and therefore tested  <dig> of the breakpoints by rh mapping with  <dig> markers. results showed that all scaffolds, with the notable exception of sca <dig> could be misassembled .

discussion
overall, the pattern of retention for the broken duck chromosome fragments in the hamster cells obtained here is very similar to that observed for the chicken radiation hybrid panel, with higher retentions for microchromosomes than for macrochromosomes. however, whereas only 23% of the chicken-hamster hybrids produced had sufficient retention frequency values to be retained in the final panel, 50% of the duck-hamster clones did. indeed, although the fusion efficiency for chicken-hamster hybrids was reported to be as high as 2– <dig> x 10- <dig> by kwok et al. <cit> , it was only approximately  <dig>  x 10- <dig> in our hands when we produced the  <dig> clones for the chicken whole genome rh panel. here, the fusion efficiency is close to  <dig>  x 10- <dig> which is three times higher. such differences could be due to variations in chromosome structure and/or content between the two bird species or to differences in culture conditions. for instance, the hprt gene used as a selection marker for the clones is on the short arm of macrochromosome gga <dig> in chicken  <cit>  and thus very likely to be on microchromosome apl <dig> in duck. microchromosomes being better retained than the macrochromosomes, having the selection gene on one of them could help recovering a higher number of clones in each fusion experiment. it is also very likely that these results are due to our change in culture conditions after the cell fusions: the chicken-hamster hybrids were cultivated at 40°c, the usual temperature for avian cells, whereas the duck-hamster ones at 37°c. similarly, ekker et al. <cit>  succeeded in producing zebrafish somatic hybrids at 37°c but not at 28°c, which is the normal temperature for the culture of zebrafish cells. more generally, the difference in optimal temperatures for the growth of donor and recipient cells may be one of the possible causes for the lower retention frequencies usually observed for somatic and radiation hybrids in non mammalian species.

to obtain the dna quantity required for building genome-wide maps, large-scale culture of the hybrid clones is necessary. however, in this process, donor dna is lost. for instance, karere et al. <cit>  reported a genome wide half-life of the donor dna of  <dig>  passages and when preparing the whole genome rh  panel in chicken, we observed the loss of 10% of the chicken genome after large cell culture of the hybrids  <cit> . this problem, in addition to the fact that large-scale culture of a rh panel requires lots of labor, encouraged us to find an alternative, such as wga or scaling down the reaction volumes. since the 1990s three major whole genome amplification techniques including primer extension pre-amplification   <cit> , degenerate oligonucleotide primed  pcr  <cit>  and multiple displacement amplification  have been developed to address the problem of limiting amounts of dna samples. pep and dop are both pcr-based methods and are limited by features of the taq polymerase: typical amplification fragment length of <  <dig> kb and an error rate of 3 × 10- <dig>  these methods also suffer from incomplete coverage and uneven amplification of the genomic loci of several orders of magnitude, with 10-2 ~ 10- <dig> and 10-3 ~ 10- <dig> fold amplification biases for pep and dop-pcr methods, respectively  <cit> . mda is an isothermal amplification employing the high fidelity phi <dig> phage dna polymerase for dna synthesis and strand displacement  <cit> . the genome coverage is much improved, with an estimation of only  <dig> % missing after wga by the mda method in mammals  <cit> . karere et al. <cit>  confirmed that mda was suitable for rh mapping and reported a high concordance rate of  <dig> % with data from genomic dna. however, even if this is true for mammals, it might not be the case of microchromosomes in an avian genome.

when comparing retention frequencies before and after wga in the  <dig> hybrids, with the  <dig> markers used for clone selection, only slight variations of retention, either gains or losses, were usually observed. however three markers, caud <dig>  s <dig> and caud <dig>  show an important loss of retention frequency after wga while two others, caud <dig> and s <dig>  show a high increase, suggesting potential coverage problems by the wga, either by lack of coverage  or by the over-representation of a region . moreover, genotyping of eight no hit est markers on wga dna, either using conventional pcr and agarose or fldmqpcr, demonstrated a very low retention which is not in accordance with the retention levels usually observed for microchromosomes. therefore, we suggest that the genomic features in the smallest microchromosomes causing coverage problems in whole genome sequencing projects may also interfere with the efficiency of wga. as we have already shown, rh mapping can allow building maps for non-sequenced chromosomes  <cit> , it is important that we produce genotyping results for them.

in this context, the fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm genotyping method can be an alternative to wga, as only minute amounts of dna  are required. high throughput gene expression analysis by real time pcr in a microfluidic dynamic array was first introduced by spurgeon et al. <cit> , and has since been successfully applied to copy number variation studies  <cit>  and quantitative mirna expression analysis  <cit> . in our case, by performing qpcr with the fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm genotyping, the additional benefit is high throughput, as the identification of bands on gel electrophoresis is replaced by monitoring the pcr with ct  and end point tm  values, allowing the distinction between specific and non-specific amplification profiles. the tm value is mainly influenced by base composition of amplicons, making it a specifically interesting parameter to follow when using markers defined from coding regions, which are more prone to cross-amplifying the hamster dna.

we tested the fluidigm genotyping method on wga dna and on standard dna, with a pre-amplification step using a mix of all primers of the  <dig> markers analyzed together in a run  <cit> . in the wga-fldmqpcr runs, ct values for the duck positive control was high with an average of  <dig> cycles , as opposed to an average of  <dig> cycles, which is in the recommended scale, for the pre-ampfldmqpcr runs . these high ct values suggested the quantity of dna template was too low  <cit> . for a variety of reasons, wga coupled with either fldmqpcr or conventional pcr and agarose electrophoresis was unsuitable for genotyping on the smallest microchromosomes. therefore, although the combination of wga and fldmqpcr would have allowed us to use less rh dna, we decided the best genotyping method was to use standard dna by fldmqpcr genotyping, with a pre-amplification step performed using a mix of all primers for a set of  <dig> markers.

the drawbacks of genotyping by fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm come from the fact that all  <dig> markers are genotyped with the same condition and therefore special care must be taken in the marker design. as a consequence, approximately 10% of the markers were discarded during the final analysis due to poor quality data.

apart from improving the genome assembly by assigning and ordering scaffolds to chromosomes, the duck rh panel can be used to test the scaffold assemblies. we tested this by genotyping markers at mb density on the  <dig> scaffolds larger than  <dig> mb, spanning altogether  <dig> mb and thus accounting for  <dig> % of the current duck genome assembly. a total of  <dig> markers were genotyped and only one marker  on the end of sca <dig> was not linked with other markers derived from the same scaffold , suggesting an overall good quality of the final genome. to test further our capacity for detecting potentially misassembled scaffolds, we took advantage of previously published data indicating that on the whole, avian chromosomes are known to be well conserved throughout evolution and more specifically, that no inter-chromosomal rearrangements, apart from the well documented case of gga4 = apl4 + apl <dig>  have been discovered between chicken and duck by current comparative cytogenetic approaches  <cit> . the  <dig> scaffolds  we detected as potential chimeras by comparative mapping had poor pair-end sequence support , suggesting most of them could indeed be misassembled . we tested nineteen of them by genotyping markers flanking the potential breakpoints . as a result, all but one scaffold  could be misassembled, and sca <dig> possibly suggesting the first detection of a small inter-chromosomal rearrangement between the duck and chicken genomes, or perhaps more likely a segmental duplication in duck or in the last common ancestor of the two species. this would need further confirmation by fish mapping with chicken bac clones. it can be noted that the pair-end sequence support for this scaffold was high, showing an agreement between sequencing and rh mapping data. when disagreements between assembly and our rh data are detected in large scaffolds, they tend to happen towards the end. to achieve better assembly accuracy, higher sequencing depth or more efforts on developing sequencing libraries with longer inserts are needed.

concerning the smallest duck microchromosomes, paralogous to those absent from the chicken assembly, we suspect similar problems will arise: lack of sequence information, difficulties in cloning, in genetic mapping, etc. rh mapping has proved useful for getting a grip on these regions and one striking example is the case of some regions of hsa <dig>  to which no corresponding chicken genome data could be assigned by sequence similarity and to which many chicken no hit est showed significant sequence similarity. rh mapping with these markers allowed building maps for gga <dig> and gga <dig>  <cit> . by developing markers targeted to this region, a small linkage group composed of  <dig> no hit markers  orthologous to hsa <dig> was obtained. when aligned to hsa <dig>  we found they spanned a  <dig> mb region on hsa19p. due to the lack of bac clones for fish or other supplementary information, we cannot identify the duck chromosome, but according to known data on synteny conservation between chicken and duck, we suggest that this small linkage group should be assigned to apl <dig>  of the  <dig> no hit to chicken markers we studied three have hits with small to medium-size scaffolds  of the duck assembly, suggesting that more sequence from the smallest microchromosomes could be obtained in ngs . chicken/duck comparative mapping of gga21/apl <dig> and gga11/apl <dig> microchromosomes demonstrate several intrachromosomal rearrangements, the first described for microchromosomes in this pair of species. the maps obtained using the usual carthagene mapping approach or the comparative approach are very similar, apart for a few markers, especially non-framework / non-robust ones, for which lower reliability in map position can be due to the limits of the possible resolution of the mapping or to genotyping errors. as the comparative approach starts with an ordering of markers corresponding to chicken, it is interesting to note that the major duck-chicken rearrangements found with the carthagene approach are confirmed. a second advantage of the comparative mapping approach and the associated construction of robust maps is that the number of robust markers obtained is usually higher than the number of framework markers in the classical approach. the major inversion found between gga <dig> and apl <dig> is confirmed by fish mapping, but also by sequence alignment of duck scaffolds on the chicken assembly. indeed, scaffold <dig>  whose integrity is demonstrated by rh mapping, with markers sca736a and sca736b positioned close to one another at  <dig> and  <dig> cr on the carthagenerh map and  <dig> and  <dig> cr on the comparativerh-robust map, is separated in two locations when aligned to the chicken sequence . likewise, although a more complex pattern of events accounts for the differences between gga <dig> and apl <dig>  one of them is supported by scaffold <dig>  whose integrity is demonstrated by rh mapping with three markers on the robust map, each of which are positioned in different regions when aligned to the chicken sequence. another is supported by markers sca871_ <dig> and sca871_ <dig>  which are co-localized on the rh map and are  <dig>  mb apart in chicken . when comparing the turkey and chicken genomes, zhang et al. also confirmed evidence for 20– <dig> major rearrangements between the two species and found one inversion between gga <dig> and mga <dig>  however, they did not observe any rearrangement between gga <dig> and mga <dig>  the mean estimated divergence time between chicken and turkey is  <dig> million years and  <dig> between chicken and duck  <cit> . a higher number of rearrangements are thus expected between the two latter pair of species. only one major interchromosomal difference -with apl <dig> and apl <dig> corresponding to gga4q and gga4p respectively  <cit> - and very few intrachromosomal rearrangements have been reported between the chicken and the duck karyotypes  <cit> . the rearrangements observed with our data between gga <dig> and apl <dig> seem more complex for example, sca246b, sca246c and sca246d are split by sca <dig> in both rh maps. likewise, sca367b and sca367c are split by sca <dig> in both rh maps, whereas they are adjacent in the chicken sequence, and sca <dig> markers are widely split in the comparativerh map, while adjacent in the chicken. further investigations and more precise maps using different techniques such as fish or bac contig maps will be needed to confirm these rearrangements. the increased resolution obtained by rh mapping as compared to the fish mapping performed to date show that intrachromosomal rearrangements might happen on a finer scale than shown until now. this means that although the simple ordering of the duck scaffolds along the chicken genome by sequence similarity helps for chromosome assignment, the duck sequence thus obtained will be wrong whenever large or small-scale rearrangements will have happened between the two species. the whole duck assembled sequence will have to be ordered using the whole genome rh map which will be constructed in our laboratory, in conjunction with other mapping methods, such as genetic and/or bac contig physical maps, the latter allowing finer mapping and orientation of small scaffolds.

CONCLUSIONS
the chicken wgrh panel has been used to construct chromosome rh maps and helped in the genome assembly or the mapping of some of the smallest micro chromosomes  <cit> . similarly, the duck wgrh panel presented here will also be a major contribution to duck genomics. rh mapping can be a complementary approach to ngs by allowing the assignment of scaffolds to duck chromosomes and furthermore, detailed rh maps will allow a precise estimation of the intrachromosomal rearrangements that have occurred between chicken and duck.

using the chicken genome as model and in combination with survey sequencing, the construction of dense rh maps of a less studied bird such as duck can be made. by taking advantage of the conservation of syntenies, optimal orders can be proposed  <cit> , thus maximizing the information obtained as first proposed by hitte et al. <cit> . indeed in duck, a dense rh map combined with scaffold sequencing and comparison to the chicken sequence, should lead to an improved genome assembly.

material and methods
generation of radiation hybrids
the method was adapted from morisson et al.  <dig>  <cit> . normal diploid fibroblasts were obtained from 12-day-old peking duck embryos from a highly inbred duck line. for each embryo, primary cells were obtained after trypsinization of the embryo tissues and the rest of the tissues were stored for dna extraction. duplex pcr was performed to test the sex of embryos according to batellier et al. <cit> . fibroblasts from only one female embryo were propagated in complete dmem medium  supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum , 1% penicillin and streptomycin) at 40°c with 5% co <dig> and used as donor cells. the hprt  -deficient hamster cell line wg3hcl <dig> <cit>  was used for recipient cells, which were cultured in complete rpmi medium  supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum , 1% penicillin and streptomycin) at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  for each fusion experiment,  <dig>  ×  <dig> duck female fibroblasts were irradiated at  <dig> rads by gamma rays from a cesium- <dig> source and mixed to an equal number of wg3hcl <dig> hamster cells. the fusion partners were then pelleted and suspended in  <dig> ml polyethyleneglycol  and after  <dig> min,  <dig> ml dmem medium without serum and antibiotics were gradually added from which  <dig> ml was taken to suspend in  <dig> ml complete rpmi medium and cultured at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  twenty-four hours after the fusion, hat  was added to the medium and four days later, the whole medium was changed to discard the non-fused cells. eight to twelve days after the fusion, the first hybrid clones were observed. when fully grown after  <dig> to  <dig> days of culture, hybrids were picked and transferred to 25-cm <dig> flasks. after confluence, the hybrid cells were subsequently transferred to two 75-cm <dig> flasks. in order to limit the loss of duck fragment during the cell passages, hybrids were cultured for only one generation and harvested when fully grown. ten million cells were kept for dna extraction and the rest were cryoconserved.

whole genome amplification
for each sample,  <dig> ng starting rh dna was amplified according to the ge healthcare illustra genomiphi hy dna amplification kit protocol. to avoid representation bias, each hybrid was amplified in three replicates which were pooled to obtain the final working panel dna . duck genomic dna, wg3hcl <dig> hamster dna and h2o were amplified in the same condition, as positive and negative controls. for genotyping experiments with the wga dna, the positive controls were duck genomic dna and wga duck genomic dna, whereas when using standard dna, both positive controls were duck genomic dna.

in silico mapping of scaffolds to the chicken assembly, as a guide for choosing markers
seven thousand two hundred and five duck scaffolds larger than  <dig> kb were aligned to the current chicken assembly using narcisse  <cit>  and  <dig>  were successfully positioned. all the data can be traced back at http://narcisse.toulouse.inra.fr/pre-narcisse/duck/cgi-bin/narcisse.cgi. according to narcisse and existing comparative genomics data obtained by fish  <cit> , approximate location of all the scaffold markers, especially chromosomal assignment could be inferred, but the real location still needed to be tested due to the possibilities of intrachromosomal rearrangement having occurred since chicken and duck divergence.

thirty scaffolds were positioned on gga <dig> and used for designing  <dig> potential apl <dig> markers, whereas  <dig> scaffolds were positioned on gga <dig> from which  <dig> potential apl <dig> marker were derived.

markers design
altogether,  <dig> markers were used in our study and detailed information is given in additional file 5: and table s <dig>  twenty one microsatellite markers are from public databases  and  <dig> camxxx markers were produced by our laboratory ;  <dig> est markers  are from est contig data ; the rest of the markers  were designed from the sequence of duck scaffolds from the genome assembly  with the primer <dig> software  <cit> . to avoid repetitive elements in the genome, the primers were checked by in-silico pcr  <cit>  and the amplicon sequences aligned to the whole genome assembly by blastn.

marker genotyping by conventional pcr and agarose gel electrophoresis 
pcr reactions contained  <dig> ng wga dna,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> u taq dna polymerase , 1x buffer ,  <dig> μm of each dntp,  <dig>  μm of each forward primers,  <dig>  μm of each reverse primers in a total volume of 15μl. pcr was performed on a geneamp pcr system  <dig> thermocycler : the first 5-min denaturation was followed by  <dig> cycles for microsatellite markers and  <dig> cycles for scaffold markers, each consisting of denaturation at 94°c for 30s, annealing at specific temperature for 30s and elongation at 72°c for 30s. pcr products were analyzed using a 2% agarose gel and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. all the markers were genotyped in duplicate.

marker genotyping by fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm quantitative pcr on wga dna 
wga dna  and an assay set containing  <dig> primer pairs in which concentration of each primer pair is  <dig> μm were loaded on a fluidigm biomarktm  <dig>  dynamic arraytm ifc. wga dna was quantified by picogreen, the ideal concentration of the dna was of  <dig> ng/μl. in fact, wga dna proved difficult to quantify by picogreen, likely due to the complex branched structure of the amplification product obtained. real time pcr was performed in the presence of evagreentm dna-binding dye, according to the manufacturer’s protocol  <cit> . all the markers were genotyped in duplicate.

marker genotyping by fluidigm biomarktm ifc dynamic arraytm quantitative pcr on pre-amplified standard dna 
standard dna was quantified by picogreen and diluted at a final concentration of  <dig> ng/μl. primer pairs for the  <dig> markers included in one fluidigm biomarktm run were diluted at a final concentration of  <dig> μm and distributed in a 96-well microplate called a  <dig> μm assay set. then  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m te and  <dig> μl of each primer mix from the  <dig> μm set were pooled in a  <dig> ml eppendorf tube and vortexed thoroughly . pre-amplification was performed in  <dig> μl, containing  <dig>  μl pre-amplification master mix ,  <dig>  μl of  <dig> markers primer mix and  <dig>  μl dna at  <dig> ng/μl . after denaturation for  <dig> min at 95°c, a pcr was performed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 95°c and  <dig> min at 60°c, and a final elongation step at 20°c for  <dig> min. the pre-amplification products thus obtained were diluted  <dig> times before the fluidigm biomarktm run. the  <dig> diluted pre-amplified samples and  <dig> μm  <dig> primer pairs assay set was loaded on a fluidigm biomarktm  <dig>  dynamic arraytm ifc, using the same procedure as for the wga-fldmqpcr marker genotyping method. all the markers were genotyped in duplicate.

interpretation of fldm data
data was analyzed using the fluidigm real-time pcr analysis software to obtain the ct values  and tm values  . for the genotyping calling, the positive control  should not be too low or too high . a hybrid was called positive when the hybrid had a ct value lower or equal to that of the negative control and a tm value close to the positive control. a genotype was called “unknown” when a hybrid had a high ct value but the same tm as the positive control or a low ct value but a tm value was slightly different  than the positive control. if no amplification of the positive control could be seen, the marker was discarded altogether.

map construction
two methods for map construction were used:  a classical approach by two point and multipoint mapping, followed by the determination of the minimal set of markers for a framework map and  a comparative map approach with statistical measure of a set of maps. the classical rh maps were constructed using the carthagene software  <cit>  in three steps:  linkage groups were defined by two point analysis using a lod score threshold of  <dig>  or  <dig>   multipoint analyses were done to define a framework map for the larger linkage groups, using a lod threshold of  <dig> for the framework maps  a comprehensive map was built by calculating the location of additional markers relative to the framework markers. the comparative map approach is described by faraut et al.,   <cit> . it uses the information of marker adjacencies in a related genome, to assist the mapping process when the experimental data is not conclusive, thus directly producing comparative maps minimizing the number of breakpoints. the comparative mapping is followed by a statistical confidence measure of a distribution of maps to evaluate map uncertainties and produce a robust map, such as described in servin et al.   <cit> . finally the map figures were created using mapchart  <cit> .

fluorescent in situ hybridisation 
chicken bac clones were chosen in the wageningen bac library  <cit>  according to their known position, as estimated by bac end sequence information, in regions paralogous to the breakpoint under study. wag19g <dig>  corresponds to the duck scaffold sca <dig>  while wag13p <dig>  and wag20c <dig>  correspond to sca <dig>  bac clones were grown in lb medium with  <dig>  μg/ml chloramphenicol. the dna was extracted using the qiagen plasmid midi kit.

fish was carried out on metaphase spreads obtained from fibroblast cultures of 7-days old chicken and duck embryos, arrested with  <dig>  μg/ml colcemid  and fixed by standard procedures. the fish protocol is derived from yerle et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . two-colour fish was performed by labelling  <dig> ng for each bac clones with alexa fluorochromes  by random priming using the bioprim kit . the probes were purified using spin column g <dig> illustra . probes were ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 50% formamide hybridization buffer  or in 40% formamide hybridization buffer for heterologous fish. probes were hybridised to chicken metaphase slides for  <dig> hours at 37°c and to duck metaphases for  <dig> h in the hybridizer . chromosomes were counterstained with dapi in antifade solution . the hybridised metaphases were screened with a zeiss fluorescence microscope and a minimum of twenty spreads was analysed for each experiment. spot-bearing metaphases were captured and analysed with a cooled ccd camera using cytovision software .
