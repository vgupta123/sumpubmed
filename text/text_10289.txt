BACKGROUND
during alternative splicing a single gene transcript is processed into several discrete mrna isoforms, each of which contains different exonic sequences and can code for distinct proteins. these genetically related gene products can have diverse, sometimes antagonistic cellular functions . mis-splicing has been implicated in numerous human diseases  <cit>  and therefore knowing the alternative splicing landscape of human tissue provides a starting point for evaluating splicing events as diagnostic markers for disease.

we wanted to develop an improved high-throughput method to precisely map the splicing events that dictate the spatial and temporal transcriptional content of an organism. some low-throughput technologies that have worked for small numbers of genes include: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , northern blots, real-time or quantitative pcr   <cit> , the taqman assay  <cit> , and sanger sequencing. these technologies are effective for individual genes, but do not scale to whole-transcriptome analyses. dna microarrays have been used to detect alternative splicing on a genomic scale, but data analysis has proven challenging due to their small dynamic range   <cit>  and high degree of cross-hybridization; related exon-exon junctions can have greater than 50% sequence similarity, making unambiguous assignment of each probe difficult  <cit> . to overcome these challenges researchers will typically assay different classes of tissues  instead of individual tissues making single sample analysis difficult or impractical  <cit> . de novo high-throughput sequencing  is by far the most promising new technology for detecting novel splice sites  <cit> . the drawbacks of using whole transcriptome hts to characterize alternative splicing are currently expense and limited dynamic range; the dynamic range is decreased for splicing studies because of the predominance of uninformative sequence, which overwhelms the small amount of alternatively spliced exon junction data obtainable. high-throughput sequencing would be much more effective if the sequences of interest could be captured prior to sequencing. molecular inversion probes  provide this exact utility; they quantitatively capture only the nucleic acid sequences of interest, which decreases cost and increases the dynamic range of individual sequencing runs.

mips are long, single stranded oligonucleotides that contain two interrogation sequences at their termini, one or two sequence tags for parallel readout with either microarrays or high-throughput sequencing, and two amplification primers that flank the sequence tags and are common to all mips . the mip assay is performed in three steps: hybridization, circularization and amplification. during the mip assay, probes hybridize to either side of a specific nucleic acid target sequence and bound mips are selected by circularizing the probes via ligation and amplified using common primers. mips can then be quantified using microarrays or hts. the mip technology was pioneered in our laboratory  <cit>  and has been used to measure gene copy number in colorectal carcinoma  <cit>  and quantify allele frequency in  <dig> different human cell lines  <cit> . we have now applied this technology to the analysis of alternative splicing.

another sequencing capture strategy, which has been used to study alternative splicing, is cdna-mediated annealing, selection, extension and ligation   <cit> . dasl is very similar to the mip alternative splicing strategy we developed, but with an important difference; interrogation sequences, barcodes and amplification sites are contained on two separate dasl probes whereas mips include all these components on a single probe. thus, significantly higher concentrations of dasl probes are necessary for corresponding probes to find each other. subsequently, cross-hybridization is an issue and multiplexing is limited to approximately  <dig> probe-pairs  <cit> . in comparison, mips are effective at orders of magnitude lower concentration because the hybridization of the first interrogation sequence accelerates the hybridization of the second in a unimolecular reaction and cross-hybridization between mips is negligible. thus, mips have been successfully multiplexed in sets of nearly  <dig>   <cit>  and it is predicted that  <dig> plex reactions are feasible  <cit> .

this paper describes the development of a mip-based assay for the high-throughput detection of alternative splicing events. the mips can accurately and quantitatively measure alternative splicing events for a number of genes in a variety of tissues. we looked at  <dig> exon junctions in  <dig> genes across five tissues, a total of  <dig> splice events . we showed that individual alternative splicing mip  measurements correlate well with direct qpcr measurements, as well as provide a concordance index  of  <dig>  when compared with a set of known splicing controls. moreover, we correctly identified tissue-specific splicing for 100% of the alternatively spliced control exons we assayed. in summary, we successfully developed a novel, high-throughput asmip assay that can efficiently detect and quantify alternatively spliced exon junctions in a variety of tissues.

RESULTS
developing and testing an alternative splicing mip assay
we set out to develop a mip-based assay that could measure exon-exon junctions quantitatively and identify alternative splicing events. to obtain this level of sensitivity we customized the design of the mip probes and optimized a rigorous four-step protocol: sample preparation, asmip hybridization, circularization, and amplification .

there are four main differences between our single-stranded, dna-based, alternative splicing mips  and the original single-nucleotide polymorphism  mips: 1) we included two sequence tags, 2) there is no gap between the probe termini when accurately annealed, 3) we did not include any deoxyuridine nucleotides between the amplification primers  <cit>  and 4) we synthesized the target cdna with primers that were covalently attached to magnetic beads; this allowed for extensive washing between enzymatic reactions, which likely improved quantitation by decreasing the background.

seventeen genes, including  <dig> total exon-exon junctions, were selected to test the new asmip assay. we identified  <dig> candidate genes that splice differentially in neural tissue  <cit> , three genes that express distinct isoforms in smooth and skeletal muscle   <cit>  and three housekeeping genes , which served as loading controls . in total, our set of known positive alternative splicing controls contained  <dig> genes,  <dig> exon-skipping events and  <dig> exon-exon junctions.

minimal probe concentrations are required for the mip assay
our goal was to develop a high-throughput alternative splicing assay. since the level of multiplexing possible for a ligation-based splicing assay is inversely correlated with probe concentration, we needed to show that the assay was reproducible with very small amounts of asmips. in our standard assay we used  <dig> femtomoles  of each probe in a  <dig> Î¼l assay . we compared the array intensities from the standard  <dig> fmol reaction against reactions with probe concentrations of  <dig> fmol and  <dig>  fmol. we obtained r <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, demonstrating that we could decrease probe concentration 10- to 100-fold without diminishing data quality . since our pilot asmip experiments were approximately 200plex, this suggests that without optimization, performing a  <dig> plex quantitative asmip assay would be straightforward.

probe effects are addressed using either a biological reference or statistically modeled baseline
we built two analysis methods that extract and score alternative splicing information from asmip and qpcr exon-junction data. for both methods we show that splice scores are significantly smaller for constitutive junctions than alternatively spliced junctions, which provides a straightforward approach for identifying alternatively spliced junctions.

the two asmip analysis methods we developed both account for the sequence-based probe effects that frequently confound inter-probe comparisons. one method uses a biological reference , which is particularly useful if there is a well-defined or biologically meaningful reference sample that can be used as a baseline to make informative comparisons across different experiments. this reference-based score does require prior knowledge of which junctions are constitutive and can be negatively impacted by poor annotation or a limited number of constitutive sites. our second analysis method is not dependent upon the accurate identification of gene-specific constitutive junctions and it does not require a biological reference. instead, we used the data across all the tested tissues to build an additive, model-based score  for each gene. different sample sets will result in differently modeled baselines, which in turn will affect m-score interpretation in the same way that different biological reference samples would affect r-scores.

for both methods, constitutively spliced junctions should score near zero while alternatively spliced junctions should have scores that differ substantially, either positively or negatively, from zero. to test our methodology, we identified a collection of  <dig> negative control junctions; these junctions are predicted to be constitutively spliced given that they are present in every mrna isoform curated by the reference sequence database   <cit> . we then compared the constitutive junctions to a set of  <dig> positive control junctions; these junctions are known to be alternatively spliced in the tissues we studied  <cit> . we found that when the absolute values of the r- and m-scores were plotted for the two sets of control junctions, they deviated significantly from each other  regardless of which technology was used . as expected, the constitutively spliced negative controls clustered tightly near zero; in comparison, the junctions known to be alternatively spliced provided significantly higher absolute values .

using receiver operating characteristic  curves we further evaluated the r- and m-score methodologies. using the positive controls described above as our set of true-positives we calculated the areas under the curves  for all three technologies; positive controls were assigned a value of  <dig>  negative controls were  <dig>  the aucs for the asmip technology ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> ; aucs for qpcr were  <dig>  . we concluded that both r- and m-scoring strategies easily distinguished known alternative splicing events from constitutive ones.

the table includes results from both the r- and m-score analyses , as well as data from asmips quantified with either arrays  or sequencing . auc and pearson correlation  values are reported.

 <dig> asmip data was compared to tissue specific, splicing controls from the literature:  <dig> tissue specific, alternatively spliced junctions  <cit>  and  <dig> predicted constitutive junctions  <cit> .

 <dig> asmip data was compared to the complete set of qpcr data,  <dig> tissue specific splice events were analyzed.

 <dig> asmip data from the set of splicing controls was compared to qpcr data from the same set of controls  <cit> ,  <dig> tissue specific splice events were analyzed.

the asmip results are correlated with direct qpcr analysis
with our analyses in place, we compared  <dig> qpcr-derived splice scores with asmip splice scores and found that the data sets were highly correlated. additionally, we observed that the sequenced asmip data combined with the m-score analysis provided the best results.

we found a positive correlation between the splice scores for asmips and qpcr . given how extensively the two methods, qpcr and asmips, differ we did not expect, nor did we see, a perfectly linear agreement, but the correlation we did see supported our conclusion that asmips quantitatively measure alternative splicing events when either analysis method  is used.

using receiver operating characteristic  curves we further evaluated the performance of the asmips compared to qpcr . to carry out this analysis we first transformed all quantitative qpcr splicing scores into ternary splicing calls by assigning positive and negative cutoffs to the data; splice scores above or below the positive and negative cutoffs for each data set would receive splice calls of + <dig> and - <dig> and be labeled as alternatively spliced, while scores between the cutoffs would have a splice call of zero and would be labeled constitutive. for qpcr, we used the mean plus and minus three standard deviations to obtain cutoffs for r- and m-scores . to plot an roc curve that combined both positive and negative splicing data, it was necessary to convert ternary splice scores  into binary scores ; true positives necessarily had the same sign  in both data sets. there were some instances where the qpcr data had the opposite sign as the asmip data and thus, the roc curves did not reach the upper right-hand corner of the graph . separate roc curves for positive and negative splicing data can be found in additional file  <dig> 

we chose to use the asmip m-score sequencing data for the majority of our downstream biological analyses because, compared to the other three methods , it provided the largest area under the curve . splicing calls were specified from this data using a cutoff of +/- <dig> , which provided a good balance between sensitivity and specificity .

100% of the tissue-specific exon-skipping controls were identified using asmips
using the asmip data, we were able to confirm the tissue-specific alternative splicing of all  <dig> skipped exon controls with two or more asmips.

in this study we included three well-characterized tropomyosin genes that are frequently used as models for alternative splicing   <cit> . these genes are known to have strong muscle-specific splicing patterns. indeed, when we looked directly at the raw, un-normalized sequencing counts for asmips interrogating exon junctions in tmp <dig> and  <dig>  and compared the results for skeletal muscle  with smooth stomach muscle  it was apparent that smooth muscle exon junctions predominated in the smooth muscle tissue, while skeletal exon junctions predominated in the skeletal muscle. it is also evident from the raw data that the constitutive junctions, which might be expected to have similar counts, instead display large variations due to inherent sequence-based probe effects . both the r- and m-scores account for these probe effects. consequently, alternative splicing is better visualized in the m-score plots  where the constitutive junctions  score near zero, while the alternative junctions  clearly score above and below the established cutoff . notably, we found that the sequenced asmips successfully identified the muscle specific splicing of all  <dig> exon junctions associated with the  <dig> skipped exons in all three tropomyosin genes tested.

we next looked at our neural-specific splicing controls by comparing our asmip m-score from sequence data against new or previously published gel electrophoresis data  <cit> . the splicing of exon- <dig> in fez <dig> is shown in detail as an example . to evaluate the neural-specific splicing controls, we compared two tissues, stomach and frontal lobe, then tallied the number of alternatively spliced exon junctions that were observed. these two tissues were chosen because they best represented the splicing differences seen for non-neural versus neural-specific tissues when assayed by gel electrophoresis  <cit> . in one case, erc <dig>  the expression levels of the gene in stomach and skeletal muscle were too low to obtain asmip measurements, thus, placenta data were used. for the neural-specific genes we identified 36/ <dig> alternatively spliced junctions and were able to confirm all  <dig> exon-skipping events in  <dig> genes. the three missed junctions bridged the skipped exons from three genes: fez <dig>  mllt <dig>  and myo <dig>  interestingly, in all three genes where this occurred the short isoform was expressed well in all tissues while the long isoform was only expressed appreciably in the two neural tissues  <cit> . thus, the failure to detect alternative splicing of the three bridging junctions may not indicate a technological error, but instead reflect the physiological isoform expression differences between these tissues.

the asmips are capable of identifying splice events in individual tissues, as well as previously uncharacterized alternative splicing events
using asmips quantified by sequencing and analyzed using the additive model  we detected  <dig> tissue-specific alternative-splicing events . the majority of which  occurred in our set of potentially alternatively spliced junctions; these junctions were expected to show some degree of alternative splicing since they mapped to unique isoforms in the refseq database  <cit> . we used qpcr and gel electrophoresis to test approximately 30% of the identified junctions. we show that our method is capable of identifying splicing events within individual tissues, as well as events that displayed complex splicing patterns across multiple tissues. to illustrate this we discuss three specific examples in detail: tpd <dig>  camk2d, and mink <dig> 

tumor protein d <dig>  is a small vesicle-trafficking protein that has been shown to be over expressed in a variety of human cancers  <cit> . tpd <dig> is known to have three isoforms  <cit> . isoform- <dig> , which lacks exon- <dig>  has been found to be the predominant isoform in brain tissue  <cit> . using our asmip data we were able to verify the expression of brain-specific isoform- <dig> and extend the analysis further to show that isoform- <dig> , which lacks exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  is highly expressed in stomach tissue . these splicing results for tpd <dig> demonstrate that asmips can identify tissue-specific splicing within a single tissue; clustering of similar tissues prior to analysis, as is commonly done for array data  <cit>  is unnecessary.

calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii delta  is a serine/threonine protein kinase and the regulated splicing of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> helps direct postnatal heart remodeling  <cit> . there are six camk2d isoforms reported by refseq  <cit>  and a seventh that was identified by clark et al.  <dig>  which we also validated as being neural specific. the neural-specific isoform lacks exon  <dig>  but contains exons  <dig> and  <dig>  our asmip studies on camk2d also demonstrated that isoform- <dig> , which contains exon  <dig>  was preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle ; again implicating the involvement of camk2d in muscle function. interestingly, this junction was initially mis-labeled in our dataset as being constitutive, but the asmip data along with the m-score analysis was able to correctly identify it as being alternatively spliced . this result exemplifies how a single asmip in a single tissue can provide valuable splicing information even when the junction is thought to be constitutive.

misshapen-like kinase  <dig>  encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is involved in cytoskeleton reorganization, cell adhesion and cell motility  <cit> . mink <dig> is alternatively spliced into four different isoforms  <cit> . in neural tissue, we verified that exon  <dig> was preferentially included in the mrna  <cit>   and showed that exon  <dig> was excluded , along with a shortened version of exon  <dig> . only one of the four isoforms contains these specific exonic sequences, suggesting that a single isoform predominates in neural tissue, isoform- <dig> . we were also able to identify the single isoform ) that is most highly expressed in stomach tissue by matching asmip data with known isoforms; in stomach, exon  <dig> is preferentially excluded while exon  <dig> and the short form of exon  <dig> are included. the mink <dig> gene illustrates how asmips can identify relevant splicing events within complex tissue-specific patterns of alternative splicing.

our detailed analysis revealed that the asmips not only confirmed the alternative splicing of our controls, but also extended what was known regarding the tissue specificity of individual isoforms.

high-throughput sequencing appears to outperform arrays for asmip quantitation
we quantified our pools of reacted asmips either with dna microarrays or hts. our results consistently showed that hts outperformed arrays for quantifying asmips. for example, auc and correlation values were significantly better  for asmips quantified by hts compared to array quantitation in three out of four analyses . in addition, more of our positive splicing controls were identified when asmips were sequenced  than when hybridized to arrays . these data all suggest that the asmip assay is more accurate when probes are quantified with high-throughput sequencing although arrays do perform adequately and could provide a more cost effective means of quantifying mips for some research projects.

discussion
in summary, we have developed a novel mip-based alternative splicing assay that is sensitive, specific, and can be highly multiplexed. we compared our asmip and qpcr methodologies and found that the correlation between asmip and qpcr is good; for sequenced asmip m-scores the pearson correlation coefficient was  <dig>  or  <dig>  depending on the data set  and the auc was  <dig>  . furthermore, when we looked at a set of splicing controls from the literature, sequenced asmips provided an auc value of  <dig>   and successfully identified 100% of the known, alternatively spliced exons along with 93% of their related junctions . additionally, several previously uncharacterized, tissue-specific splice events were revealed . we have also shown that asmip probes can be diluted to sub-femtomolar quantities . we conclude that the asmip assay is capable of accurate, multiplexed quantitation of alternative splicing in human tissues; our data suggests that  <dig> plex reactions will be feasible in the near future.

the advantage of using a sequence capture strategy to analyze alternative splicing in samples that could, in theory, be quantified directly using high-throughput sequencing is that you can dramatically increase the dynamic range of sequencing runs by increasing the amount of usable data. for example, if one looked at  <dig>  exon junctions captured by asmips with 20-million short sequence reads, the dynamic range would be three orders of magnitude . if one directly sequenced the sample with 20-million short reads mapped to the genome, only about 4% of those reads would likely overlap any exon junction   <cit> . if there are approximately  <dig>  genes in the human genome with an average of 9- <dig> junctions   <cit>  the dynamic range drops to  <dig> , less than one order of magnitude for direct sequencing.

one major advantage of asmips over other parallel sequence capture technologies such as dasl  <cit>  is high level of multiplexing that is possible with unimolecular probes. highly multiplexed reactions require small amounts of probe and we showed that only minute amounts of each asmip are necessary for quantitative alternative splicing measurements; asmip reactions carried out with  <dig> attomole  of each probe were tightly correlated  . snp mips have already been successfully used in ~ <dig> plex reactions  <cit>  and  <dig> plex reactions have been proposed  <cit> . the actual limit of multiplexing for mips has not been determined; it could, in practice, be significantly greater than  <dig> plex.

exon arrays also provide a high level of multiplexing, but the large variation in probe hybridization  <cit>  and the smaller dynamic range  <cit>  often confounds data analysis and impedes the identification of individual tissue specific splicing changes. the asmip assay does not appear to suffer from the same limitations and consequently, can accurately identify independent tissue-specific splicing changes, like those seen for tpd <dig> and camk2d , whereas exon arrays struggle with the same task  <cit> .

the asmips are well suited for quantifying known alternative splice events accurately in a single tube using a minimum of sample, but there are projects for which the technology is not ideal; large-scale analyses on a small number of samples might not be cost-effective and novel splice sites can not be identified using this method. certainly, economies of scale would offset the initial financial outlay for large libraries of oligonucleotide probes and thus, asmip collections would be a valuable resource, easily shared among laboratories. however, researchers conducting global splicing studies on only a few samples will likely find hts more attractive than asmips, particularly when a large dynamic range is not essential. similarly, researchers desiring to map isoforms or identify a collection of potential cancer biomarkers de novo would likely use high-throughput sequencing. but once those biomarkers have been identified then asmips are perfectly poised to accurately and cost-effectively characterize those splicing biomarkers in patient samples. indeed, by barcoding each asmip reaction prior to quantitation one could assay  <dig> splice junctions in  <dig> samples using a single hts reaction, producing a >1000-fold dynamic range. in this case, employing asmips would be less expensive and provide a larger dynamic range than carrying out  <dig> separate hts reactions.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that our asmip technology can effectively quantify alternative splicing in human tissues and is well adapted for in-depth splicing studies on several hundred to tens-of-thousands of biologically important splice junctions in a variety of organisms.
