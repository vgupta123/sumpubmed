BACKGROUND
leukocyte ig-like receptors  are a family of innate immune receptors that are predominantly expressed on cells of the myelomonocytic lineage  <cit> . the  <dig> members of the lilr protein family are divided into 'activating'  or 'inhibitory'  receptors on the basis of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. there is a growing interest in lilr expression and/or function in situations of immune dysregulation and following transplantation  <cit> , but as innate immune receptors they would also be predicted to play a role in an immune response to infection.

lilrb <dig> was first identified as an inhibitory receptor expressed on myeloid antigen presenting cells which associates with the protein tyrosine phosphotase shp- <dig>  <cit> . the importance of this particular receptor as an immune modulator was highlighted when it was shown that high level expression of lilrb <dig> with lilrb <dig> rendered antigen presenting cells tolerogenic  <cit> . lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> may differ in their mechanisms of immune regulation. in receptor ligation studies, the tolerogenic properties of lilrb <dig> appear to result from phenotypic changes to the antigen presenting cells that express them, including failure to upregulate co-stimulatory proteins and mhc class ii  <cit> . in contrast, although no receptor ligation studies have been performed for lilrb <dig> on antigen presenting cells, at least some of its inhibitory effects may result from reverse signalling through its t cell ligand, as soluble forms of lilrb <dig> have been shown to suppress t cell responses  <cit> . lilrb <dig> ligation was therefore performed to determine the phenotypic effects of receptor engagement on antigen presenting cell phenotype.

given their potential to inhibit t cell proliferation, lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> have been studied in the context of allograft tolerance during transplantation and during cancer  <cit> . the ability of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> to modulate t cell responses could also be of relevance during infection, where skewing of lilrb <dig> and/or lilrb <dig> expression might alter the course of an immune response. to better understand the inhibitory potential of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> during pathogenic challenge, we set out to determine how their expression is modulated on antigen presenting cells infected with salmonella typhimurium, as this obligate intracellular pathogen infects macrophages.

RESULTS
cell surface phenotype and t cell stimulatory capacity of lilrb4-ligated dendritic cells
flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers was used to determine the effects of lilrb <dig> ligation on the cell-surface phenotype of antigen presenting cells cultured in vitro. this technique has been used successfully for studies of other lilr family members  <cit> . cells were cultured with a lilrb4-specific antibody  and crosslinking agent , both replenished throughout culture in order to maintain receptor crosslinking. ligation with zm <dig>  triggers lilrb <dig> activation and shp- <dig> recruitment  <cit> . ligation of lilrb <dig> led to an upregulation of the co-stimulatory protein cd <dig> on dendritic cells on both immature and lps-matured dendritic cells . no significant effects on the expression of cd1a, cd <dig> or cd <dig> were observed.

we also tested whether ligation of lilrb <dig> resulted in any cell-surface changes that might inhibit the ability of dendritic cells to stimulate naïve cd4+ t cells. mixed leukocyte reactions  were performed using naïve cd4+ t cells isolated from allogeneic subjects. results of five mlr experiments indicated no consistent increase or decrease in t cell proliferation in response to lilrb <dig> cross-linked dendritic cells .

lilrb <dig> ligation alters the cytokine secretion profile of macrophages
we then examined the effects of lilrb <dig> ligation on cytokine secretion by antigen presenting cells. supernatants were harvested from in vitro macrophage cultures. during an initial screen by cytokine bead array , differences in il- <dig> and il- <dig> production were observed. these changes were further analysed by elisa. although results were not statistically significant by two-sided student's t test, the concentration of il- <dig> in culture supernatant was seen to be decreased following lilrb <dig> ligation for both immature and lps-matured cells . in contrast, lilrb <dig> cross-linking increased levels of il- <dig> in the culture supernatant.

salmonella typhimurium infection upregulates expression of lilrb <dig> and lilrb4
to investigate the biology of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> on antigen presenting cells in the context of infection, we infected monocyte-derived macrophages with salmonella typhimurium transformed with the pfvp <dig> -gfp plasmid  <cit> . infection of macrophages was confirmed by gfp expression as assessed by flow cytometry. real-time pcr analysis showed upregulation of both lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> in salmonella-infected macrophages . a similar result was observed when macrophages were treated with heat-killed bacteria .

we then investigated whether bacterial components known to trigger toll-like receptors  could elicit a similar response. recognition of lipopolysaccharide  is predominantly mediated by tlr <dig>  <cit> , and flagellin, a potent innate immune stimulator is recognised by tlr <dig>  <cit> . treatment of in vitro-cultured macrophages with salmonella typhimurium lps led to an increase in lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> in our real-time pcr assay, similar to that observed for whole salmonella. upregulation was less pronounced for cells treated with flagellin . tlr stimulation was also performed on in vitro-cultured dendritic cells, with a general upregulation of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> observed following lps stimulation, and little or no effect for flagellin treatment .

discussion
we have shown that continuous ligation of lilrb <dig> during in vitro culture of dendritic cells led to an enhanced upregulation of cd <dig>  this contrasts with lilrb <dig>  where ligation results in a failure to upregulate costimulatory proteins including cd <dig>  <cit> . a mixed leukocyte reaction assay further confirmed that lilrb <dig> cross-linking did not result in any changes to the surface phenotype of antigen presenting cells that could inhibit t cell proliferation. our results complement previous work from suciu-foca et al, which has shown that a soluble form of lilrb <dig> is sufficient to inhibit t cell stimulation  <cit> . thus, although they have similar expression profiles and similar effects on t cell proliferation, lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> may use different modes of action to regulate t cell activity - with lilrb <dig> limiting the co-stimulatory potential of antigen presenting cells whilst lilrb <dig> acts through its t cell ligand, during t cell/antigen presenting cell contact.

although limited effects on the surface phenotype of antigen presenting cells were observed in our study, lilrb <dig> cross-linking did result in some alteration of cytokine secretion profile. lilrb <dig> ligation led to an upregulation of il- <dig> secretion by in vitro-cultured macrophages. this inhibitory cytokine may contribute to a feedback loop of lilr-mediated inhibition as it upregulates lilrb <dig>  lilrb <dig>  lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> on antigen presenting cells  <cit> . il- <dig> is an inflammatory chemokine that attracts cells of the innate immune system  <cit> . that lilrb4-ligation results in increased production of il- <dig>  a potently anti-inflammatory factor  <cit> , and correspondingly reduces expression of the strongly inflammatory il- <dig>  is consistent with its immune inhibitory nature.

the interaction between professional antigen presenting cells and antigen-specific t cells provides signals important for the efficient activation and maintenance of a t cell response but also, as evidenced by our receptor-ligation studies, provides signals important for regulation of inflammation. we propose that lilrb <dig> plays a dual immunoregulatory role to limit both innate and adaptive immunity; cell-cell contact would allow lilrb <dig> on the antigen presenting cell to deliver an inhibitory signal to t cells to regulating adaptive immunity whilst delivering an inhibitory signal to innate immune cells through decreased il- <dig> 

although we saw no effect of lilrb <dig> cross-linked antigen presenting cells on the quantity of t cell proliferation, it is possible that there may have been qualitative differences in the t cell cultures. further studies would be necessary to determine whether culture with lilrb4-crosslinked antigen presenting cells leads to alterations in t cell function or the ratio of, for example, regulatory or suppressor subsets.

the rapidly growing field of lilr biology has begun to address the expression and relevance of these receptors during immune dysregulation or transplant situations, but there is relatively little knowledge regarding lilr during infection. to address this, we observed the effects of salmonella infection on lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> expression. infection of macrophages with salmonella resulted in an upregulation of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig>  similar effects were observed when cells were treated with heat-killed salmonella or salmonella lps, which might indicate that the effects we observed during salmonella infection were largely due to lps recognition. the effects of lilr and tlr signalling on each other's expression and function is likely to be a future topic of interest in the field of innate/adaptive immune regulation; both families are predominantly expressed on the same cell types, lilr activity can inhibit tlr function  <cit> , and tlr triggering can modulate lilr expression  <cit> . the relationship between tlr  and lilr  may therefore represent an immunostimulatory/immunoregulatory balance, with inhibitory lilr upregulation acting as a mechanism to prevent an over-exuberant immune response.

antigen presenting cells show versatility in their ability to tailor an immune response specific to individual classes of pathogens. variations in lilr expression profile, with their effects on surface phenotype and cytokine secretion, could help skew immune responses in different directions. our experiments, and those of cohen et al using porphyromonas gingivalis show an upregulation of lilrb <dig> in response to lps treatment  <cit> , but stimulation with tlr <dig> ligands led to a downregulation of lilrb <dig>  <cit> . it is also notable that in microarray analysis for salmonella typhimurium lacking a virulence factor that can promote lps modification, lilrb <dig> was one of the few genes whose expression was reduced  <cit> .

normally, inflammation is a balanced process; the production of anti-inflammatory factors is crucial in limiting the response to the site of pathological challenge. expression levels of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> were previously shown to correlate with inhibitory activity and are enhanced in the presence of anti-inflammatory agents  <cit> . our finding that lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> are upregulated in response to salmonella stimulation indicates that these receptors play a role in limiting the inflammatory response during infection.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the inhibitory effects of lilrb <dig> do not result from a failure to upregulate co-stimulatory proteins. in addition to the high level expression that can render antigen presenting cells tolerogenic, there may be a role for lower level expression and activity of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> in response to tlr signalling during an immune response to bacterial infection. the differing roles of lilrb <dig> and lilrb <dig> on antigen presenting cell biology and in t cell/antigen presenting cell interactions warrant future studies that should prove useful in multiple fields of immunology and infectious disease.
