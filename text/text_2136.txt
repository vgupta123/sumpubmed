BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells, genome replication is initiated from multiple sites termed replication origins. the locations of those origins and their relative activation times during s phase are largely conserved between individual cells defining the dna replication program . in recent years, the dna replication program was mapped in different organisms . early replication was found to correlate with low mutation rate  <cit> , high gene expression, open chromatin and a reduced nucleosome abundance  <cit> . yet little is known about the genetic determinants of origin replication times or firing efficiencies. moreover, while the replication program is clearly reproducible at the level of cell populations, it is not clear whether individual cells activate the same origins in the same precise temporal order or whether origin firing is partly stochastic .

in the budding yeast, many perturbations which extend s phase have a small effect on the replication program since the activation times of most origins are delayed in proportion to s phase duration. this was first observed in cells subject to a non-lethal dosage of hydroxyurea   <cit>  and later when analyzing the replication profiles of thirteen s phase mutants identified in an unbiased screen for cells with an extended s phase  <cit> . those mutants were associated with aspects of dna replication including the replication machinery, cell-cycle regulation and nucleotide metabolism. s phase was significantly extended in all mutants, but the genome-wide replication program was hardly altered: the identity of activated origins and their relative activation times  remained essentially the same as those in wild-type. in most mutants, a minority of origins were lost  <cit> . origin loss was reported previously in cells deleted of clb <dig>  <cit> .

this scaling of the replication program was not observed in just one perturbation, deletion of mrc <dig>  similarly to the other mutants, mrc <dig> deletion extended s-phase. however, rather than losing origins, dormant origins were now activated so that a larger number of origins contributed to dna replication. the resulting replication profile was sharper and was clearly distinct from all other profiles. a more recent study reported a similar sharpening of the replication profile in fission yeast deleted of the mrc <dig> homologue  <cit> .

mrc1p plays a dual role in replication. first, mrc1p functions in the replication checkpoint by mediating the dna damage signal from the sensor mec1p to the checkpoint kinase rad53p. the possible involvement of the replication checkpoint in the scaling phenotype was suggested  <cit> , since deletion of either mec <dig> or rad <dig> activated late origins that were inhibited by hu treatment . this activation of late origins is reminiscent of the increased origin firing observed when mrc <dig> was deleted. however, mrc1p is found also at all unperturbed forks where it interacts with both the dna helicase  and dna polymerase epsilon  <cit> , and promotes the coupling of polymerase progression to dna synthesis  <cit> . deletion of mrc <dig> reduces fork progression rate  <cit> . also, when replication is arrested by environmental stress such as hu, mrc1p promotes the formation of a stable pausing complex  <cit> .

in this study we asked which of the mrc <dig> functions is responsible for the unique replication profile of the mrc <dig> deleted cells. to this end we first analyzed different mrc <dig> alleles that separate its function in checkpoint signaling from its role in normal replication. second, we examined s phase mutants that are also checkpoint-deficient and deleted of either the checkpoint kinase, mec <dig> or the checkpoint sensor, rad <dig>  third, we analyzed cells deleted of tof <dig> which cooperates with mrc <dig> during normal replication and cells expressing distinct pol <dig> alleles differing by their interaction with mrc1p. we find that scaling of the replication program does not require an intact checkpoint and provides evidence that the unique profile of mrc <dig> deleted cells results from mrc1p function in normal replication. we propose that sharpening of the replication profiles upon mrc <dig> deletion is explained by the associated reduction in fork-velocity.

RESULTS
the replication profile of cells deleted of mrc1
to enable a rigorous comparison of different replication profiles and, in particular, to define more rigorously the unique profile of mrc <dig> deleted cells, we revisited the data we reported previously describing the replication profiles of mutants with an extended s phase  <cit> . these replication profiles were generated by microarray-based measurements of the dna content of fluorescence-activated cell sorting -sorted s phase cells . to obtain higher resolution data and verify our previous results we repeated those experiments using high-throughput sequencing. the temporal replication profile is obtained by plotting the  read-count as a function of the chromosomal coordinate. this profile describes the abundance of each genomic region in the s-phase population and, hence, correlates with its replication time or efficiency; loci that replicate early in s phase are present at high abundance in this asynchronous population, whereas the abundance of loci that replicate late is low. replication origins are, therefore, detected as peaks in this profile, and their relative height indicates their typical firing time or efficiency.

we previously reported that the replication profile of mrc <dig> deleted cells is unique and we now verified it again using the sequencing-based profiles . visual inspection suggested that the replication profile of mrc <dig> deleted cells is significantly sharper than that of the wild-type profile . as we described previously, this sharpness results from strong activation of origins that remain largely dormant in wild type cells. many of the new peaks in the mrc <dig> profile are listed as confirmed origins in oridb  <cit> , and careful visualization of the wild-type profile suggests that they are weakly activated also in wild-type. the sharpness of each replication profile can be quantified by the heights of the local maxima, and by the depths of the local minima . it can also be measured by plotting the autocorrelation function describing the typical chromosomal distance over which dna abundance correlates . this sharpening of the profile was unique to mrc <dig> deleted cells and was not observed in any of the other s-phase mutants we tested. in fact, the other mutants showed the opposite phenotype, being smoother than the wild-type profile by both our criteria: lower local maxima and a slower-decaying autocorrelation. .figure  <dig>

notably, known replication origins were best predicted by the mrc1Δ profile, increasing the number of correctly identified origins from  <dig> in wild type cells  to  <dig> in mrc <dig> deleted cells . predictions based on profiles of the other mutants tested were equivalent, or worse than the wild-type prediction. together, these observations indicate that while most mutants display a smoother profile characterized by a lower number of active origins, deletion of mrc <dig> sharpens the profile, with a larger number of origins significantly contributing to dna replication.

the replication phenotypes of different mrc <dig> alleles that differently influence dna checkpoint activation
mrc <dig> has a dual role in replication, acting as a mediator of the replication checkpoint response during replication stress and also assisting fork progression during normal replication. we examined four alleles that were reported to differentially affect the mrc <dig> role in checkpoint activation: the mrc1-aq allele is mutated in all of its phosphorylation sites and is incapable of mediating the checkpoint signal  <cit> . similarly, the mrc1-n <dig> allele generated through a partial n-terminal deletion interacts synthetically with rad <dig> deletion, indicating a role in the checkpoint response  <cit> . we further examined two mrc <dig> alleles obtained by c-terminal deletions: mrc1-c <dig> and mrc1-c <dig>  those mutations extend s-phase but are not synthetic lethal with rad9Δ or rrm3Δ and show normal hu resistance, suggesting an intact checkpoint. therefore, those mutations impact on mrc <dig> function during normal replication  <cit> .

the replication profile of mrc1-aq was highly similar to the wild-type, while that of mrc1-n <dig> was an intermediate between the wild-type and full mrc1deletion . perhaps more informatively, both c-terminal mutants, which left the checkpoint intact, displayed a phenotype that was highly similar to that of mrc1-deletion and, in fact, was significantly sharper than the checkpoint deficient alleles . these results suggest to us that the unique replication profile of mrc1deleted cells occurs even in the presence of intact checkpoint.figure  <dig>

impaired checkpoint does not explain the mrc1Δ phenotype
to further examine the possible role of the dna replication checkpoint in the scaling of the replication profile with s phase duration, we tested more directly the replication profiles of mutants deficient in replication checkpoint function. the checkpoint is impaired in strains deleted of the dna damage sensor mec <dig> or the checkpoint kinase rad <dig>  <cit> . deletion of mec <dig> or rad <dig> is lethal, but can be rescued by the deleting sml <dig>  an inhibitor of the rnr enzyme regulating dntp production  <cit> .

the replication profiles of the single or double deletion mutants  were practically indistinguishable from the wild-type profile by all our measures . since those cells had a normal s phase, we additionally deleted genes that extended s phase  in the background of mec1Δsml1Δ deleted cells, generating three triple-mutant strains in which s phase is extended and the replication checkpoint is impaired. we examined the replication profile of the three mutants. the profiles were strongly correlated with those of the single deletion  profiles, showing the same scaling-like phenotype. correlation of those profiles to the profile of the mrc <dig> deleted strain was low . together, these results indicate that the checkpoint is not required for the scaling of the replication profile with s phase duration and that the replication phenotype of mrc <dig> deleted cells is not connected to its role in mediating the checkpoint response.figure  <dig>

the mrc1-deletion phenotype is recapitulated by mutations that corroborate mrc <dig> function in normal replication
mrc1p is present in unperturbed replication forks where it interacts with the dna polymerase. the tof1p protein is required for mrc1p function in normal replication but not for its checkpoint-associated role  <cit> . examining the replication profiles of cells deleted of tof <dig>  we find it to be sharper than the wild-type profile, being more similar to the profile of mrc <dig> deleted cells than to the profile of the other mutants .figure  <dig>

mrc1p interacts with dna polymerase ε through both the c- and n- terminals of the catalytic pol <dig> subunit  <cit> . in the presence of hu the c-terminal interaction persists, indicating that it is independent of the checkpoint, whereas the n-terminal interaction is lost. it was suggested that mrc1p links the polymerase with the dna helicase and in this way facilitates the progression of the replication fork under normal conditions and ensures the coordinated motion of the helicase and polymerase when nucleotide pulls are depleted under hu treatment  <cit> . we, therefore, asked whether mutations in the polymerase ε itself which impair its interaction with mrc <dig> will result in a replication profile similar to that of the mrc1Δ cells.

we considered three temperature-sensitive pol <dig> alleles: pol2- <dig>  pol2- <dig> and pol2- <dig>  all three mutants display an extended s-phase. in addition, all three are synthetic lethal with mrc1deletion  <cit> . pol2- <dig>  which lacks the n-terminal , is checkpoint proficient but displays a slow progression of the replication fork  <cit> , while pol2– <dig>  which lacks a fraction of its c-terminal, is checkpoint deficient  <cit> . finally, pol2– <dig>  which has a mutation in the n-terminal catalytic domain pro710ser, is synthetic lethal with rad9Δ, indicating a role in the checkpoint response  <cit> .

notably, while s phase was equally extended in all three mutants , their temporal replication program was distinct. the profile of pol2- <dig> allele was most similar to that of mrc1Δ deleted cells, consistent with its association with mrc1p during normal replication. pol2– <dig> on the other hand displayed the opposite phenotype characteristic of most non-mrc <dig> mutants and was more correlated with the profile of the clb5Δ cells, again consistent with our conclusion that the checkpoint is not required for the scaling phenotype. finally, the pol2– <dig> profile most closely resembled the wild-type profile, indicating the most efficient scaling of its temporal replication program with s phase duration .

discussion
replication checkpoint does not inhibit origin firing in cycling cells
our results demonstrate that deletion of mrc <dig> sharpens the replication profile not because it impairs the function of the dna replication checkpoint, but because it impairs the normal progression of the replication fork. this strongly argues that the replication checkpoint is not required for the scaling of the replication program with s phase duration observed in multiple s phase mutants.

previous studies reported that deletion of rad <dig> re-activates late origins which are inhibited by hu treatment  <cit> . this phenotype is similar to the activation of dormant origins observed in mrc1-deleted cells. we, therefore, began our study by hypothesizing that the mrc <dig> deletion phenotype reflects lack of scaling due to an impaired checkpoint. our results, however, largely refute this hypothesis. in fact, we found that perturbing the checkpoint in cycling cells does not increase the number of active origins and does not alter scaling. for example, deleting the checkpoint sensor mec <dig> in multiple mutant backgrounds that extended s phase duration maintained the approximate scaling of the replication profile with s phase duration, and decreased rather than increased the number of active origins contributing to dna replication.

similarly, in our data, deletion of rad <dig> did not significantly alter the replication program. rather, cells maintained a replication profile that was largely similar to that of wild-type cells. it should be noted that our assay differed from the one used previously to characterize the rad53p role that we considered unsynchronized s-phase population. in contrast, previous studies synchronized the cells and analyzed them at specific time points following release from cell-cycle arrest, not accounting for possible differences in the progression rates through s phase  <cit> .

mrc <dig> phenotype reflects its function in normal replication
we provided evidence that the mrc1Δ phenotype is due to its function in normal replication. mrc1p interacts with pol2p, and its deletion is known to reduce fork velocity. similarly, fork velocity is reduced also in the pol2- <dig> allele, and we, indeed, found that the temporal replication program in cells carrying this allele is highly similar to that of mrc <dig> deleted cells. a similar phenotype was found also when deleting tof <dig> which assists mrc <dig> function in normal replication.

reduced fork velocity likely increases the number of origins that are activated, as it reduces the likelihood of passive replication by a fork emanating from a nearby origin. therefore, more origins will be activated, as is indeed observed in the mrc <dig> deleted cells. in this scenario, mrc <dig> deletion does not affect the identities of the origins or their initiation rate, but simply reduces the length of the typical region replicated between two initiation events. s phase becomes longer simply because it now takes longer to complete replication, although more origins are involved in the replication process.

CONCLUSIONS
interpreting replication profiles of s phase mutants
mutations that alter s phase are instrumental in revealing the molecular mechanism defining the replication program. the finding that most s phase perturbations delay origin activation in proportion to s phase duration suggests that this program is regulated by global factors that equally affect most origins. despite this overall scaling, however, there are clear differences between individual mutants reflected in the apparent decreased efficiency of late, or less efficient origins  <cit> . this decreased efficiency is more apparent in some strains  than in other strains. furthermore, the relation between s phase extension or distribution and the associated replication profile is not clear; for example both mrc <dig> and clb <dig> deleted cells extended s phase to the same extent, yet show opposite replication profile phenotypes. similarly, the s phase distribution of the different mutants we analyzed, as captured by the associated flow-cytometer profiles, varies. those differences are difficult to interpret in the absence of a mechanistic model. several models were suggested to explain the mechanistic basis of the dna temporal replication program, invoking either a temporal regulation of origin firing, or a stochastic firing with some origin-specific probabilities  <cit> . while those models were evaluated with respect to their ability to predict the wild-type replication profile, they should be instrumental in defining the expected differences in the replication profiles upon s phase perturbations, and thereby interpreting mutant effects in a more rigorous manner.
