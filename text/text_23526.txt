BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide range of diseases in both immunologically normal and compromised hosts. the natural habitat of s. aureus is the nasal cavity of warm-blooded animals. over the past ~ <dig> years, s. aureus has undergone genetic changes that have resulted in antibiotic-resistant strains  <cit> . importantly, the methicillin-resistant strains  are now the most common cause of nosocomial s. aureus infections and are spreading throughout communities  <cit> .

staphylococcus aureus has a number of characteristics that allow it to survive host bactericidal factors and environmental stresses, including drastic changes in osmotic pressure  <cit> . osmoprotectants such as choline, glycine betaine, and proline accumulate in cells in response to osmotic stress  <cit> . multiple genes, including the branched-chain amino acid transporter gene brnq  <cit>  and the arsenic operon regulatory gene arsr  <cit> , cooperatively participate in salt tolerance. in addition, a very large cell wall protein, ebh, is involved in tolerance to transient hyperosmotic pressure  <cit> .

in general strategy, the phospholipid composition of bacteria changes in response to growth phase or environmental stressors such as osmolality  <cit> , ph  <cit> , temperature, and the presence of organic solvents  <cit> . in the 1970s, the molecular mechanism of staphylococcal salt resistance was studied, focusing on a phospholipid, cardiolipin   <cit> . cl possesses four acyl groups and carries two negative charges  <cit> . in stationary phase, 30% of the s. aureus cell membrane is composed of cl  <cit> . it has been reported that cl can stabilize liposomes during osmotic stress  <cit>  and that it is required for the growth of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis under high-salt conditions  <cit> . however, the role of cl in the molecular mechanism of staphylococcal resistance to high salinity remains unknown.

in this study, we used an improved lipid extraction method to assess the phospholipid composition of s. aureus and performed molecular genetic analyses to evaluate the role of cl in the resistance of s. aureus to high salinity.

RESULTS
staphylococcus aureus phospholipid composition
the phospholipid composition of s. aureus grown under various conditions was analyzed. previous studies with specific s. aureus strains under defined conditions have indicated that the cl level increases as the cells enter stationary phase  <cit>  and when cultured under high-salt conditions  <cit> . in our initial experiments, the cl level varied among the s. aureus strains tested , probably because the cell wall reduced the cl extraction efficiency. pretreatment with lysostaphin , which degrades the gly5-bridge structures in cell walls  <cit> , increased the cl extraction efficiency without affecting the amounts of other phospholipids extracted . with this method, the cl level did not differ significantly among the strains tested . therefore, cells were treated with lysostaphin prior to lipid extraction in all subsequent experiments.

the phospholipid profile obtained in the present study  was similar to those reported by others  <cit> . the signal that intensified as cells entered stationary phase  was identified as cl based on molecular mass analysis  <cit> . however, we did not detect a reproducible increase in the cl level in response to the addition of nacl . this was the case for s. aureus n <dig>  and strain 8325- <dig> and its derivatives rn <dig> and sh <dig> .

molecular genetic analysis of two cardiolipin synthase homologs
importance of cl for long-term survival under high salinity
given that cl plays a regulatory role during cell replication and division in e. coli  <cit> , we investigated the role of the cls genes in cells during growth phase transitions in  <dig> % nacl lb . mutation of the cls genes did not affect the growth curve until  <dig> h , after which the cls1/cls <dig> double mutant showed slightly lower optical density. however, stationary-phase cfu numbers did not differ significantly between the cls1/cls <dig> double mutant and the parent strain . moreover, the cfu numbers were sustained in both strains until at least  <dig> h post-inoculation . we conclude that cl is not necessary for cell growth and stationary phase survival of s. aureus under these conditions.

in a high-salinity medium , the growth yield was reduced in n <dig> and cls mutants , but the growth of cls mutants was not significantly different from that of the parent strain. in contrast, the number of cls1/cls <dig> double mutant cfus was drastically reduced after ~ <dig> to  <dig> h in high-salinity medium . this reduction was not observed in either of the single mutants, suggesting that one cls gene is sufficient for long-term survival in high salinity. no growth was detected in medium containing 25% nacl. although the number of cfus decreased gradually in both n <dig> and its cls mutants, the decrease was much faster for the cls1/cls <dig> double mutant after  <dig> h. based on these findings, we conclude that cl is critical for staphylococcal fitness under conditions of high salinity.

no difference in susceptibility to antibiotics affecting cell walls , quinolones , arbekacin, or the antimicrobial peptides asabf-α  <cit>  and nisin was observed between the n <dig> and its cls mutants . the mic of nisin for both s. aureus n <dig> and its cls mutants was  <dig> μg ml- <dig> 

effect of cls mutations on l-form generation
staphylococcus aureus cannot form normal colonies in the presence of penicillin. after a prolonged incubation, colonies with a 'fried egg shape' emerge  <cit> . this adapted cell form is termed the l-form  <cit> . staphylococcus aureus has especially high turgor pressure, and the l-form is induced under conditions of 5% nacl and 5% sucrose. the l-form cell is able to grow without a cell wall, is gram-negative, and lyses readily under hypotonic conditions . thus, the l-form cell must have mechanisms allowing it to survive in such environments without the physical support of a cell wall. as one l-form strain has been shown to accumulate large amounts of cl  <cit> , we investigated the possibility that cl is important in the generation of the l-form variant by constructing cls mutants in the mt <dig> strain, which is capable of generating the l-form. the lack of cls genes did not abolish l-form generation, although the efficiency of l-form generation was reduced in the cls <dig> single and cls1/cls <dig> double mutants, but not in the cls <dig> single mutant .

function of cls <dig> in stress responses
discussion
cardiolipin is known to play a role in the adaptive mechanisms of some bacteria to high salinity stress  <cit> . for example, a deficiency in cl decreases the growth rate in b. subtilis under conditions of  <dig>  m  nacl  <cit> . additionally, salt-sensitive s. aureus mutants contain no or only a small amount of cl  <cit> . therefore, we were surprised to find that the growth of s. aureus under conditions of high salinity did not depend on cl . this may be attributable to the presence of other mechanisms, including species-specific systems such as variations in cell wall proteins  <cit> , that give staphylococci the ability to cope with high-salt stress  <cit> . however, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that cl is important for long-term fitness of s. aureus under conditions of high salinity. this is an important finding in understanding the nacl resistance of s. aureus, which is itself important for commensal growth on skin and mucus membranes, survival on dry surfaces during indirect transmission, and persistence in foods with a high salt content  <cit> .

cardiolipin depletion did not increase the susceptibility of s. aureus to cell wall-targeted antibiotics, suggesting that cl alone is not responsible for bacterial survival against these challenges. we also examined the susceptibility of s. aureus and its cls mutants to cationic antimicrobial peptides; because cardiolipin is negatively charged, a decrease in total negative charge on the membrane surface may contribute to reduced cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance  <cit> . however, cl depletion had no effect on susceptibility to the antimicrobial peptides asabf-α and nisin. it is possible that the net negative charge is compensated for by other membrane components such as pg. in fact, the pg level was increased in the mutants that did not accumulate cl. the importance of positively charged lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol   in resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides has been reported  <cit> , and the lpg level was not different between wild-type s. aureus and cls mutants. in addition to the probable effect of cell surface charge, we have previously reported that cell wall thickness is an important factor affecting resistance to the antimicrobial peptide asabf-α  <cit> . furthermore, in the present study, asabf-α-resistant strains had cell walls that interfered with cl extraction . cell wall thickness may also be related to resistance against other antimicrobial peptides in s. aureus  <cit> .

our data indicate that lysostaphin treatment is critical for the efficient extraction of cl from s. aureus. previous reports have suggested that cl is not readily extractable from b. subtilis and other gram-positive bacteria without lysozyme treatment  <cit> . this may be attributable to its large molecular mass  relative to that of other phospholipids, owing to its four acyl residues. however, ~25-kda globular hydrophilic molecules can pass freely through the ~2-nm holes in the peptidoglycan polymer that forms the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . instead, the efficiency of cl extraction is likely reduced by its physical interactions with cell wall components; for example, when cl is bound to cell wall components, it will not efficiently enter the organic phase during extraction.

the membrane of the l-form variants of s. aureus is thought to express certain features that support cell growth and survival in the absence of a rigid cell wall. one study reported that a particular l-form strain had an increased cl level  <cit> . our data demonstrate that the cls <dig> gene is important for normal l-form generation. however, the cls1/cls <dig> double mutant still produced l-form cells, suggesting the existence of a cl-independent mechanism. thus, multiple mechanisms may function in cooperation to generate l-form variants. the production of a number of factors such as carotenoids, catalase, coagulase, lipase, fibrinolysin, hemolysin, and enterotoxin changes upon l-form generation and reversion  <cit> . however, none of these represents a common l-form variant phenotype, suggesting that l-form generation is associated with a drastic phenotypic conversion. the increase in cl content may be important, but not essential, for membrane stabilization.

in this study, both cls <dig> and cls <dig> were shown to encode functional cl synthases. under our experimental conditions, cls <dig> was the dominant cl synthase gene. the cls <dig> mutant did not differ from the parental strain in its growth rate, survival at stationary phase, total cl accumulation, or l-form generation. however, our data indicate that the synthesis of cl by cls <dig> helps the cls <dig> mutant to survive prolonged incubation under high-salt conditions , suggesting that cls <dig> has a specific function under stress conditions if cls <dig> is unavailable. future studies should examine the functional characteristics of these two cl synthases, including possible differences in their subcellular localizations.

CONCLUSIONS
improved lipid extraction and molecular genetic analyses showed that both cls <dig> and cls <dig> participate in cl accumulation. the cls <dig> gene appears to serve a housekeeping function, while cls <dig> is active under stress conditions. staphylococcus aureus can grow under conditions of high salinity without cl, but cl is required to survive prolonged high salinity stress and to generate l-form variants. this cl-dependent survival helps to explain the success of s. aureus as a human pathogen and skin/mucus membrane commensal.
