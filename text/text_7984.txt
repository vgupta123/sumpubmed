BACKGROUND
docosahexaenoic acid , which is an n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acid , has been shown to have a positive effect on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and some cancers  <cit> . dha is necessary for the development of the brain and retina of infants, and it is important in maintaining brain function in adults  <cit> . oceanic fish and fish oil products are typical dietary sources of dha  <cit> . however, because of emerging concerns over the sustainability of marine resources and the levels of environmental contaminants present in fish, major efforts have been made to identify or create alternative sources of dha  <cit> .

schizochytrium limacinum sr <dig>  is a marine thraustochytrid that can synthesize lipids with a high content of dha. in sr <dig>  total fatty acids reportedly constitute more than 50 % of the dry cell weight   <cit> , and about 30–40 % of the fatty acids of this strain are dha  <cit> . in addition, a number of studies have confirmed the safety of dha-rich oil extracted from schizochytrium sp. in recent years  <cit> . for these reasons, dha from microorganisms has been widely incorporated into infant formulas and health products for elderly persons  <cit> . in addition, industrial utilization of this organism as a commercial source of dha is currently receiving much attention  <cit> .

the dry cell weight, lipid content, and dha percentage of the total fatty acids are three important parameters for evaluating fermentations. many efforts have been directed towards improving the dha yield.  to optimize the culture medium, it was demonstrated that using glucose and glycerol as mixed carbon sources, the dha productivity was  <dig>  % higher than that obtained using glucose as single carbon source  <cit> .  to improve the fermentation process, a nh4-ph-auxostat system was developed that appears to be a promising technique for the first stage of production of schizochytrium sp. biomass as a means of achieving the fastest possible growth rate  <cit> . a two-stage oxygen supply control strategy was applied to the dha fermentation. with this protocol, the production of biomass and dha improved to  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/l, which increased  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively  <cit> .  to enhance metabolic regulation, a strategy was proposed that reinforces acetyl-coa and nadph supply. by adding 4 g/l malic acid, the dha content among the total fatty acids increased from 35 % to 60 %. the total lipid content also showed an apparent increase of 35 % and reached 19 g/l when 40 ml ethanol/l were added  <cit> . although many strategies have been applied to improve dha production, some problems still exist during the fermentation process. for example, the growth of sr <dig> is unstable and cell viability is low. the mechanism of dha synthesis is still unclear, and cell metabolism is difficult to regulate by genetic manipulation.

a genome-scale metabolic model  represents the microbial metabolic genotype–phenotype relationships of an organism  <cit> . such models have been widely used in many contexts, such as contextualizing high-throughput data, understanding complex biological phenomena, guiding metabolic engineering, directing hypothesis-driven discovery, interrogating multi-species relationships, and discovering network properties . the release of the whole genome sequence of s. limacinum sr <dig> and corresponding literature reports have made the reconstruction of a gsmm possible.

in this study, a gsmm of s. limacinum sr <dig> was reconstructed. using this model, we first made a comparison with two oleaginous fungi, mortierella alpina and yarrowia lipolytica, that are used for industrial production of arachidonic acid  and eicosapentaenoic acid , respectively. then the pathway of dha biosynthesis in sr <dig> was resolved based on genome annotation results and literature mining. based on the gsmm, biochemical and genetic strategies were applied to improve dha production.

RESULTS
genome-scale reconstruction and general features of model icy1170_dha
the reconstructed gsmm of schizochytrium limacinum sr <dig>  which contains  <dig> reactions and  <dig> metabolites, was named icy1170_dha . model icy1170_dha consists of  <dig> intracellular metabolic reactions and  <dig> transport reactions.  <dig>  % of the total open reading frames , corresponding to  <dig> genes of  <dig>  orfs, were incorporated into the model. in icy1170_dha, all  <dig> reactions  were classified into  <dig> different subsystems, according to the kegg pathway database : carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism , other amino acids  metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, transport reactions, exchange reactions, and other metabolisms . among them, lipid metabolism ranks as the largest subsystem in icy1170_dha , followed by amino acid metabolism , which agrees with model icy <dig> for mortierella alpina . the sum of the three largest subsystems, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, accounts for over half of the total number of reactions . the difference between the two models was that, in model icy1170_dha, the third largest subsystem is carbohydrate metabolism, while in model icy <dig>  transport reactions rank third, which means that m. alpina has more transport mechanisms than s. limacinum.fig.  <dig> metabolic subsystems distribution for in silico models. a, s limacinum model icy1170_dha, b, m. alpina model icy <dig>  ‘other metabolisms’ subsystem contains glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism



the essentialities of individual genes of s. limacinum were analyzed under minimal glucose  and yeast extract  medium conditions using icy1170_dha by deleting each gene in turn. the genes were categorized into three classes: essential genes, partially essential genes and non-essential genes. the gene essentiality study revealed that a total of  <dig> genes were essential in both ye and mg medium. an additional  <dig> genes were essential only in mg medium . when comparing the distribution of essential genes in different culture media, for amino acid metabolism most genes were only essential in mg medium . since ye medium is supplemented with all of the amino acids, some of the amino acids were directly consumed from the medium without utilizing their biosynthetic pathways . for example, aurli1_ <dig>  and aurli1_ <dig> , which convert aspartate into arginine, were essential only when grown in mg medium. interestingly, the ‘other metabolism’ subsystem contained the same proportion of essential genes  in both media. that means that, in this subsystem, the pathway of squalene biosynthesis does not have many alternative routes and is quite rigid in s. limacinum.fig.  <dig> the distribution of essential genes in different media. a the minimal glucose medium ; b the yeast extract medium 



similarly to model icy <dig>  model icy1170_dha had more reactions, metabolites, and genes than model iyl619_pcp  <cit>  for yarrowia lipolytica . however, the orf coverage of icy1170_dha was a little lower than the other two models. when ignoring compartment information, not including transport and exchange reactions, models icy1170_dha, icy <dig>  and iyl619_pcp contain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> reactions, respectively. and  <dig> reactions were present in all these three models . models icy1170_dha and icy <dig> both shared  <dig> reactions, which account for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of total reactions, respectively. this means these two models are similar in biochemical reactions to some degree. however,  <dig> reactions  were unique in model icy1170_dha, and  <dig>  % of these unique reactions were distributed across lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. for example, it was reported that s. limacinum could grow with arabinose as the carbon source  <cit> , whereas y. lipolytica and m. alpina could not use arabinose  <cit> . reactions that can convert arabinose into glucose  are thus unique in model icy1107_dha . in addition, there were two pathways for synthesizing lysine, starting from aspartate or 2-oxoglutarate according to the genome annotation results, whereas in models iyl619_pcp and icy <dig> only the second pathway for lysine biosynthesis is present. reactions involving the first pathway must also be unique in model icy1170_dha.table  <dig> features of the in silico genome-scale metabolic model of s. limacinum, m. alpina and y. lipolytica

verification and simulation of model icy1170_dha
data from batch cultures of s. limacinum grown in glucose and glycerol media were used to validate icy1170_dha. both of the in silico media contain the basic elements, such as c, n, h, o, p, s . when using glucose or glycerol as carbon source, their maximum uptake rates were  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h and  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h, respectively   <cit> . to simulate cellular growth in the different media, the biomass equation was maximized in the flux analysis simulations. notably, simulation results were consistent with observed growth rates . without the constraints of production, for the glucose medium, the in silico simulation predicted cell growth of  <dig> /h, which was very close to the experimentally observed specific growth rate of  <dig> /h   <cit> . and for the glycerol medium, the simulated result was only  <dig>  % lower than the experimental result  <cit> . however, when the dha synthesis rate was constrained at  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h  <cit> , the in silico result was  <dig>  % lower than experimental result  <cit> . this means the synthesis of dha may require other nutrients, apart from amino acids. and the replacement of yeast extract by inorganic nitrogen could lead to these nutritional deficiencies.table  <dig> the in silico glucose minimal media composition of the model icy1170_dha

apart from the growth rate simulation, the ability of icy1170_dha to utilize different carbon and nitrogen sources has been verified. according to literature reports, s. limacinum can grow using  <dig> kinds of carbon sources and  <dig> kinds of inorganic nitrogen sources, such as nh4+, no3−, and urea. however, the simulation results show that the model could not grow using  <dig> carbon sources, including xylose, arabinose, lactose, starch, and trehalose . it also could not grow on a medium using no3− as the nitrogen source. after a series of gap filling and model debugging steps, ten reactions were added to the model. for example, lactose galactohydrolase , which can convert lactose into glucose, was not found during genome annotation. after filling this gap, the model could grow with lactose as the carbon source. all of these simulation results, including the growth rate simulations and usage of different carbon and nitrogen sources, indicated that the model icy1170_dha is reliable and can be used for further prediction and analysis.table  <dig> comparison between experimental results and simulated results about the usage of different carbon and nitrogen sources

resolving the dha synthesis pathway based on model icy1170_dha
there are two pathways that can synthesize dha, the conventional fatty acid synthesis  route and the polyketide synthase  system  <cit> . in the fas route, fatty acids are biosynthesized in the form of either c16: <dig> or c18: <dig> saturated fatty acids. these fatty acids are then modified through a sequence of desaturations and elongations so that extended ranges of unsaturated fatty acids and pufas are produced  <cit> . in this route, dha is synthesized by delta- <dig> desaturase, which can transform c22: <dig> to c22: <dig> . in the pks pathway, acyl carrier protein , generated by coa, is used as a covalent attachment point for chain synthesis, which proceeds with reiterative cycles. during the full fatty acid synthesis process, a series of enzymes including 3-ketoacyl synthase , 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase , enoyl reducatase , and dehydrase/isomerase  are necessary . however, the whole genome annotation results showed that s. limacinum does not contain delta- <dig> desaturase, in agreement with literature reports. on the other hand, some orfs in s. limacinum were predicted to be potential pks proteins . this means s. limacinum could not synthesize dha by the fas route, but rather employs the pks system for pufa biosynthesis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a scheme to account for the formation of dha by the pks route of synthesis in s. limacinum. ks, 3-ketoacyl synthase; kr, 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase; er, enoyl reducatase; dh, dehydrase/isomerase



when compared with m. alpina, which synthesizes arachidonic acid via the fas route, the dha synthesis in s. limacinum does not need much more oxygen in the pks route. doublerobustnessanalysis results showed that, when the growth rate was fixed, a low oxygen uptake rate  was beneficial for dha accumulation  while, at the cell-number-increasing stage, to acquire large quantities of cells for lipid accumulation, an abundant oxygen supply was necessary. this means that, during the dha fermentation process, a two-stage oxygen supply strategy could improve dha production efficiency  <cit> .fig.  <dig> doublerobustnessanalysis of the relationship among oxygen uptake rate, growth rate and dha production



similarly to the fas pathway, two steps in the pks cycle, catalyzed by kr and er, also require nadph  <cit> . flux balance analysis shows that, in ye medium, a total of  <dig> reactions involving nadph have fluxes . and of these reactions, three are major sources of nadph. one is catalyzed by malic enzyme . the other two are in the pentose phosphate pathway and are catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , respectively. their corresponding fluxes of nadph were  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h,  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h, and  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h. in addition to nadph, acetyl-coa, which is the precursor for fatty acid de novo biosynthesis, also plays an important role. the flux of acetyl-coa used for fatty acid synthesis was  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h.

biochemical engineering strategies for improving dha production by in silico simulation
malate plays an important role in the tca cycle. catalyzed by me, malate can be converted into pyruvate, accompanied by nadph. based on the ye medium, when the maximum uptake rate of malate was set at 1 mmol/gdw/h, dha production increased  <dig>  %. this was in agreement with ren’s report that, after adding 4 g/l malate, the dha content of the total fatty acids increased from 35 % to 60 %  <cit> . it was also proved that the addition of malate lead to an increase in dha production of  <dig>  %  <cit> . flux balance analysis  results showed that, by adding malate, the flux of nadph supplied by the reaction catalyzed by me increased from  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h to  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h, an increase of  <dig>  %. additionally, flux distribution showed that the pentose phosphate pathway was enhanced by  <dig>  %, which means that, by adding malate, more nadph was supplied for dha biosynthesis. in addition to nadph, citrate lyase , which can catalyze the cleavage of citrate, is the source of acetyl-coa for fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . adding citrate in silico led to a  <dig>  % increase in dha production. the corresponding acetyl-coa flux provided by this pathway was also increased by  <dig>  %. this also agreed with wang’s report that a  <dig>  % improvement in dha production was gained by adding citrate  <cit> .

dcw, lipid content, and dha percentage of total fatty acids are three important parameters for evaluating the fermentation process. and amino acids can be utilized by microorganisms both as a carbon source and a nitrogen source for cell growth. in ye medium, we first calculated the uptake rate of  <dig> amino acids by fba. for nine amino acids , the uptake rate could reach the set maximum values . for the others, the uptake rates were lower than  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h. this means these nine amino acids could promote the growth of s. limacinum sr <dig>  so the effect of each amino acid on dha production was simulated by adding them individually to the mg medium. the maximum uptake rate of each amino acid was fixed at 1 mmol/gdw/h, and only the nine amino acids could promote both growth and dha production. dha production was increased by  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  %, respectively .fig.  <dig> simulation results of amino acids uptake rates and their effects on dha production. a
in silico result of  <dig> different amino acids uptake rates in ye medium. b effect on dha production by adding different amino acids to mg medium



furthermore, these simulation results were verified by experiment. the experimental results showed that addition of eight of the nine amino acids  could promote cell growth . the addition of asparagine could improve the dry cell weight from  <dig>  g/l to  <dig>  g/l, an increase of  <dig>  %, whereas adding cysteine to the culture medium inhibited the growth of sr <dig>  the reason may be that only cysteine contains sulfur, and excess sulfur may inhibit cell growth. the robustness analysis results also showed that the optimized sulfate uptake rate for growth was  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h . besides, the experimental results also proved that the addition of ala, gly, asn, glu, ser, and thr  could improve dha production . compared to the control group, the addition of asn led to a  <dig>  % increase  in dha production, bringing the dha content up to  <dig>  % of total lipids .fig.  <dig> effects on dry cell weight, total lipids, and dha production of adding nine different amino acids to s. limacinum cultures



combined with the fba results, after adding asn, sr <dig> could uptake asn directly from the in silico medium, instead of using the pathway to generate asn starting from asp. via adenylosuccinate synthase  and adenylosuccinate lyase , extra asp was converted into fumarate, enhancing the tca cycle. as a result, fluxes of two reactions involving acetyl-coa were also enhanced significantly. for example, the flux of acetyl-coa supplied by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  was increased  <dig>  %, and acetyl-coa flux used for the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis via acetyl-coa carboxylase  was also increased  <dig>  %. in addition to enhancing acetyl-coa generation, the addition of asn also increased nadph flux for producing dha. after adding asn, two fluxes in the pentose phosphate pathway catalyzed by g6pd and pgd both increased  <dig>  %. this means adding these amino acids could improve dha production through enhancing the supply of both acetyl-coa and nadph.

genetic engineering strategies for improving dha production by in silico overexpression
moma was used to re-calculate the fluxes for the overexpression algorithm. this simulation was carried out based on ye medium. the lower bound of the dha exchange reaction was set as  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h. then each reaction that had non-zero flux value in the fba simulation was overexpressed computationally. after finishing the cycle for over-expression, according to equation  <dig>   <dig> reactions catalysed by  <dig> genes were identified as potential targets .fig.  <dig> the effect of single gene overexpression on the specific dha production and fph




these potential targets could be classified into two groups, one of which is directly involved in dha synthesis while the other is involved in cell growth . during the biosynthesis of dha, acetyl-coa synthetase  could promote acetyl-coa generation  <cit> . overexpressing acs led to an increase in dha production from  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h to  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h . me was assumed to be the major supplier of nadph for fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . when me was overexpressed in silico, dha production rose to  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h. as a dehydrase/isomerase  involved in the last step of dha synthesis in the pks system,  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h dha was accumulated by overexpressing this gene. genes involved in cell growth were distributed across many metabolic subsystems, such as carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. for example, phosphomannomutase  and guanosine diphosphomannose phosphorylase  are two genes involved in the synthesis of l-galactose, which is a precursor of the biomass function. the growth rate decreased by  <dig>  %, and dha production increased  <dig>  % by overexpressing these two genes. after overexpressing prpp synthetase , fluxes used for the synthesis of amp increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  mmol/gdw/h, which led to a  <dig>  % improvement in dha production and an  <dig>  % decrease in growth rate.

CONCLUSIONS
a gsmm of s. limacinum sr <dig> for dha production, named icy1170_dha, which contained  <dig> reactions,  <dig> metabolites, and  <dig> genes, was successfully reconstructed. based on glucose and glycerol constraint conditions, the simulated results for growth rate were only  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % lower than experimental results, respectively. use of  <dig> carbon sources and  <dig> nitrogen sources by sr <dig> also agreed well with literature reports. moreover, after the addition of malate and citrate, dha production increased  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. furthermore,  <dig> of  <dig> amino acids  were predicted to increase dha production. according to experimental results, of these  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> have been proved to improve dha production. the addition of asn could lead a  <dig>  % increase in dha production. based on moma,  <dig> overexpressed genes, such as those encoding acetyl-coa synthetase and malic enzyme, were identified as having a positive effect on dha production.
