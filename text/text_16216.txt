BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cell cycle is a complex process and is precisely regulated at many levels. one important aspect of this regulation is at the transcriptional level. that is, many genes specific to the cell cycle are transcribed just before they are needed  <cit> . to have a good understanding of the cell cycle, it is essential to identify the cell cycle-regulated genes and their transcriptional regulators. dna microarray analysis has revealed that the expression levels of ~ <dig> genes vary in a periodic fashion during the yeast cell cycle, but little is known about the transcriptional regulation of most of these genes  <cit> . to fill this gap, we aim to identify the cell cycle transcription factors  that regulate the cell cycle-regulated genes inferred by dna microarray analysis  <cit> .

two major approaches have been proposed to identify cell cycle tfs. first, clustering and motif-discovering algorithms have been applied to cell cycle gene expression data to find sets of co-expressed genes and plausible binding motifs of their tfs  <cit> . this approach has been expanded to incorporate existing knowledge about the genes, such as cellular functions  <cit>  or promoter sequence motifs  <cit> . however, this approach provides only indirect evidence of genetic regulatory interactions and does not directly identify the relevant cell cycle tfs. second, the chip-chip technique was developed to identify physical interactions between tfs and promoters. using chip-chip data, simon et al.  <cit>  investigated how the yeast cell cycle gene expression program is regulated by the nine known major transcriptional activators. later, lee et al.  <cit>  constructed a network of tf-promoter interactions and harbison et al.  <cit>  constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code. however, chip-chip data alone cannot tell whether a tf is an activator or a repressor and, most importantly, chip-chip data are noisy and, depending on the chosen p-value cutoff, may include many false positive or false negative tf-promoter binding relationships. for example, if the p-value cutoff is chosen to be  <dig> , a false negative rate of ~24% in determining tf-promoter binding was estimated  <cit> .

to overcome the weakness of the above two approaches, we develop a method  to systematically identify cell cycle tfs by combining four data sources: transcription factor binding site , mutant, chip-chip, and cell cycle gene expression data. in order to reduce the high false negative rate of the chip-chip data, we use current tfbs data  <cit>  to avoid using a stringent p-value threshold  to determine tf-promoter binding. we assume that a tf binds to a specific promoter if  the p-value for the tf to bind the promoter is â‰¤  <dig>  in chip-chip data and  the promoter contains one or more binding sites of the tf. that is, we allow the p-value cutoff to be relaxed to  <dig>  but the tf-promoter binding event must be supported by the tfbs data.

it is known that the chip-chip technique can only detect those tf-promoter binding events that happen in the same physiological condition in which the chip-chip experiment is conducted, so it can potentially miss many tf-promoter binding events. we use the mutant data  <cit>  and the tfbs data  <cit>  to rescue some of these false negative tf-promoter binding events. we assume that a tf binds to a specific promoter if  the disruption of the tf results in a significant change of expression of the gene that has the specific promoter and  the promoter contains one or more binding sites of the tf. that is, the tf-promoter binding event can be assumed without using chip-chip data if it is supported by both the mutant and the tfbs data. this step can rescue some plausible tf-promoter binding events that are missing in the current chip-chip data.

from the above procedure, we can derive a high-confidence tf-promoter binding matrix . however, binding of a tf to the promoter of a gene does not necessarily imply regulation. a tf may bind to the promoter of a gene but has no regulatory effect on that gene's expression. hence, additional information is required to solve this ambiguity inherent in the tf-promoter binding matrix. in this study, we use the additional information provided by the yeast cell cycle gene expression data  <cit>  to solve this problem. we use a time-lagged dynamic system model of gene regulation to describe how the target gene's expression during cell cycle is controlled by the tfs that bind to its promoter . among these bound tfs, those that have significant regulatory effects on the target gene's expression can be extracted . from this procedure, we can refine the tf-promoter binding matrix into a high-confidence tf-gene regulatory matrix. each tf-gene regulatory relationship in this matrix is supported by at least three data sources: gene expression, tfbs, and chip-chip or/and mutant data. from the high-confidence tf-gene regulatory matrix, the regulatory targets of each of the  <dig> tfs in yeast can be inferred. finally, a tf is said to be a cell cycle tf if a statistically significant portion of its regulatory targets are cell cycle-regulated genes.

RESULTS
identification of  <dig> cell cycle tfs
by integrating current chip-chip, mutant, tfbs, and yeast cell cycle gene expression data, our method identified  <dig> cell cycle tfs . among them,  <dig> are known cell cycle tfs according to the mips database  <cit> , including the nine well-known major cell cycle tfs , and cin <dig>  cst <dig>  and stb <dig> 

the twelve known cell cycle tfs  are bold-faced and colored blue. the  <dig> identified tfs are ordered by the confidence of being cell cycle tfs ). for each identified cell cycle tf, the cell cycle phases in which the tf functions are shown. "e" means that the prediction is supported by experimental evidence, "c" means that the prediction is supported by previous computational studies, and "n" stands for our novel prediction.

the remaining five predicted novel cell cycle tfs  are supported by three lines of evidence. first, each novel cell cycle tf has physical or genetic interactions with some known cell cycle tfs , suggesting that these five tfs may play a role in the yeast cell cycle. second, four  of the five predicted novel cell cycle tfs have also been predicted in previous computational studies  <cit> . third, ash <dig>  rlm <dig>  stp <dig> and tec <dig> were predicted to be cell cycle-regulated by previous studies  <cit> . being cell cycle regulated themselves, these tfs may play a role in the cell cycle process.

the cell cycle phases in which a cell cycle tf functions
after identifying the cell cycle tfs, it is desirable to determine in which cell cycle phases a cell cycle tf functions. we regard that a cell cycle tf functions in the x phase  if a statistically significant portion of its regulatory targets belong to the x phase cell cycle-regulated genes defined by spellman et al.  <cit>  . we found that a cell cycle tf may function in more than one cell cycle phase . on average, 86%  of our predictions have literature support. more specifically, 39%  of our predictions have experimental evidence and 47%  of our predictions are consistent with previous computational studies .

the following predictions have experimental evidence. ace <dig> and swi <dig> have been shown to control certain genes expressed in mg <dig>  <cit> , supporting our prediction that ace <dig> and swi <dig> function in mg <dig>  it is known that in the absence of ndd <dig> and fkh <dig>  mcm <dig> participates in the regulation of genes essential for cellular functions specific to late mitosis and early g <dig>  <cit> , supporting our prediction that mcm <dig> functions in mg <dig>  previous molecular and genetic analysis suggested that sbf  and mbf  are activators of genes essential for cellular functions specific to late g <dig>  <cit> , supporting our prediction that mbp <dig>  swi <dig>  and swi <dig> function in g <dig>  two genomic studies  <cit>  indicated the involvement of sbf in regulating s phase genes, supporting our prediction that swi <dig> functions in s phase. simon et al.  <cit>  and lee et al.  <cit>  indicated the involvement of sbf and fkh1/fkh <dig> in regulating sg <dig> genes, supporting our predictions that swi <dig>  fkh <dig> and fkh <dig> function in sg <dig>  previous studies have demonstrated that mcm <dig> interacts with ndd <dig> and fkh1/fkh <dig> to regulate genes necessary for both entry into and exit from mitosis  <cit> , supporting our prediction that fkh <dig>  fkh <dig>  mcm <dig> and ndd <dig> function in g2m.

identification of novel cell cycle-regulated genes
for each of the  <dig> identified cell cycle tfs, we look at their regulatory targets to find novel cell cycle-regulated genes. we regard a gene as a cell cycle-regulated gene if it is regulated by at least two of the  <dig> identified cell cycle tfs. the requirement for defining a cell cycle-regulated gene to be regulated by at least two rather than one cell cycle tf is to reduce the number of false positives. in total, we identified  <dig> novel cell cycle-regulated genes that are not in the set of  <dig> cell cycle-regulated genes identified by spellman et al.  <cit> . we found that 64%  of the novel cell cycle-regulated genes have literature support. more specifically, 25%  of our predictions have experimental evidence and 39%  of our predictions are consistent with previous computational studies . among the  <dig> identified novel cell cycle-regulated genes,  <dig> genes have no known function according to the saccharomyces genome database  <cit> . we suggest that these  <dig> uncharacterized genes are involved in the cell cycle process. two lines of evidence supported our predictions. first, 68%  of these genes have literature support. more specifically, 26%  of our predictions have experimental evidence and 42%  of our predictions are consistent with previous computational studies . second, each of these  <dig> genes is regulated by at least two cell cycle tfs, and the tf-gene regulatory relationship is supported by at least three data sources: gene expression, tfbs, and chip-chip or/and mutant data. let us consider three examples. according to the saccharomyces genome database  <cit> , yjl160c is a putative cell wall protein, bud <dig> may be involved in the budding process, and ycg <dig> may be involved in mitotic chromosome condensation. however, the exact functions of yjl160c, bud <dig> and ycg <dig> are still unknown  <cit> . since cell wall synthesis, budding and chromosome condensation are all important to the cell cycle process  <cit> , this suggests that yjl160c, bud <dig>  and ycg <dig> play a role in the cell cycle process, supporting our predictions.

discussion
advantages of our method
our method has four features that make it more powerful than existing approaches. first, it can reduce false negatives in determining tf-promoter binding events from current chip-chip data. most previous methods  <cit> , except gram  <cit> , used a stringent p-value threshold  to determine tf-promoter binding events in order to reduce the number of false positives, but it was at the expense of false negatives   <cit> . in comparison, our method allows the p-value cutoff to be relaxed to  <dig>  but requires that the promoter must have one or more binding sites of the tf. therefore, using additional information provided by the tfbs data, our method can rescue some false negatives without substantially increasing the number of false positives. for example, we rescue  <dig> binding targets of ace <dig>  the promoter of each of these  <dig> genes has one or more binding sites of ace <dig>  however, their p-values of binding events in the chip-chip data are all larger than  <dig> , so they would not have been identified using a stringent p-value of  <dig>  .

second, it is known that chip-chip data can only indicate those tf-promoter binding events that happen in the same physiological condition in which the chip-chip experiments are conducted. therefore, many plausible tf-promoter binding events may be missing in the current chip-chip data. in order to solve this problem, our method considers that a tf binds to a specific promoter if the disruption of the tf results in a significant change of the expression of the gene that has the specific promoter and if the promoter contains one or more binding sites of the tf. that is, using the information provided by the mutant and the tfbs data, our method can rescue many tf-promoter binding events that are missing in the current chip-chip data. for example, we rescue  <dig> binding targets of ace <dig>  the promoter of each of these  <dig> genes has one or more binding sites of ace <dig> and the disruption of ace <dig> results in a significant change of the expressions of all these  <dig> genes  <cit> . all these genes would not be identified as binding targets of ace <dig> even when using a relaxed p-value of  <dig>  in the chip-chip data .

third, our method can extract plausible tf-gene regulatory relationships from tf-promoter binding relationships. most pervious methods  <cit>  regard the tf-promoter binding relationships provided by chip-chip data as the tf-gene regulatory relationships. this may not be true because the binding of a tf to the promoter of a gene does not necessarily imply regulation. a tf may bind to the promoter of a gene but has no regulatory effect on that gene's expression. to solve this problem, our method uses a time-lagged dynamic system model of gene regulation to extract the tfs that have significant regulatory effects on the target gene's expression from all tfs that bind to the promoter of the target gene. through this process, our method can extract plausible tf-gene regulatory relationships from tf-promoter binding relationships. thus, in our method each tf-gene regulatory relationship is supported by at least three data sources: gene expression, tfbs, and chip-chip or/and mutant data. we found that, on average, 44% of the binding targets of the  <dig> identified cell cycle tfs are their regulatory targets . this ratio is slightly lower than gao et al.'s estimation   <cit>  and wu et al.'s estimation   <cit> , possibly due to our stringent requirement for a tf-gene regulatory relationship to be supported by at least three data sources, whereas in both previous studies the tf-gene regulatory relationship is only supported by two data sources: gene expression and chip-chip data.

fourth, our method can identify the time lag for a cell cycle tf to exert regulatory effects on its target genes. it is known that the regulatory effects of a tf on its target genes may have a time lag  <cit> . by using a time-lagged dynamical system model, our method takes the time lag into consideration, making it more realistic than those previous studies that did not allow a time lag  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the average time lag for each of the  <dig> cell cycle tfs to exert regulatory effects on its target genes was estimated.

performance comparison with existing methods
four previous studies also tried to identify the yeast cell cycle tfs. tsai et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> cell cycle tfs by applying a statistical method  and cheng et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> cell cycle tfs by applying another statistical method . cokus et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> cell cycle tfs by applying linear regression analysis. andersson et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> cell cycle tfs by applying rule-based modeling. since these four approaches are different from ours, a performance comparison should be done. as suggested by de lichtenberg et al.  <cit> , we tested the ability of each of these five methods to retrieve the known cell cycle tfs annotated in the mips database  <cit> . performance comparison was based on the jaccard similarity score  <cit> , which scores the overlaps between a method's output and the list of known cell cycle tfs . therefore, the higher the jaccard similarity score, the better the ability of a method to retrieve the known cell cycle tfs. as shown in table  <dig>  our method has the highest jaccard similarity score among the five methods. therefore, our method outperforms the four existing methods.

performance comparison was based on the jaccard similarity score  <cit> , which scores the overlaps between a method's output and the list of known cell cycle tfs. specifically, the jaccard similarity score is defined as tp/, where tp stands for true positives, fp for false positives, and fn for false negatives. note that the higher the jaccard similarity score, the better the ability of a method to retrieve the known cell cycle tfs.

robustness against different cell cycle gene expression datasets
we applied our method to two newer cell cycle gene expression datasets  published by pramila et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . both datasets are alpha-factor synchronized microarray time series spanning two cell cycles. the alpha <dig> dataset has a sampling interval of  <dig> minutes and a total of  <dig> data points, and the alpha <dig> dataset has a sampling interval of  <dig> minutes and a total of  <dig> data points. we found that among the  <dig> cell cycle tfs identified using spellman et al.'s dataset,  <dig> tfs are also identified using the alpha <dig> dataset, and  <dig> tfs are also identified using the alpha <dig> dataset . this suggests that our method is robust against different cell cycle gene expression datasets.

parameter settings of our method
the choices of both the relaxed p-value and time-lag parameter have biological meanings. two previous papers  <cit>  used a statistical error model to assign a p-value of the binding relationship of a tf-promoter pair. they found that if p =  <dig> , the binding relationship of a tf-promoter pair is of high confidence and can usually be confirmed by promoter-specific pcr. if p >  <dig> , the binding relationship of a tf-promoter pair is of low confidence and cannot be confirmed by promoter-specific pcr most of the time. however, if  <dig>  <p â‰¤  <dig> , the binding relationship of a tf-promoter pair is ambiguous and can be confirmed by promoter-specific pcr in some cases but not in the other cases. our aim is to solve this ambiguity, so we choose  <dig>  to be the relaxed p-value. we say that an ambiguous binding relationship of a tf-promoter pair is plausible if  <dig>  <p <  <dig>  and if the promoter contains one or more binding sites of the tf. as to the time-lag parameter, its value is chosen to make the maximal time lag approximately equal to two consecutive cell cycle phases because simon et al.  <cit>  found cases where a cell cycle tf that expresses in one phase of the cell cycle can regulate genes that function in the next phase.

we regard a gene as a cell cycle-regulated gene if it is regulated by at least two of the  <dig> identified cell cycle tfs. the requirement for defining a cell cycle-regulated gene to be regulated by at least two rather than one cell cycle tf is to reduce the number of false positves. when the stringent criterion is used, 64%  of the identified novel cell cycle-regulated genes are supported by the literature, whereas when the loose criterion is used, only 50%  of the identified novel cell cycle-regulated genes are supported by the literature. in this study, we want to be more conservative on calling a gene a "novel" cell cycle-regulated gene, so we aim to eliminate many false positives, though at the expense of some false negatives.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a method to identify cell cycle tfs in yeast by integrating current chip-chip, mutant, tfbs, and cell cycle gene expression data. we identified  <dig> cell cycle tfs,  <dig> of which are known cell cycle tfs. the remaining five tfs  are putative novel cell cycle tfs. our predictions are supported by interactions  data and previous studies. in addition, our method can assign each cell cycle tf to specific cell cycle phases in which the tf functions. we found that a cell cycle tf may function in more than one cell cycle phase. on average, 86% of our predictions have literature support . besides, our method can identify the time lag for a cell cycle tf to exert regulatory effects on its target genes. by using a time-lagged dynamical system model, our method takes the time lag into consideration, which makes it more biologically realistic than those previous studies that did not allow a time lag. moreover, we identified  <dig> novel cell cycle-regulated genes, 64% of which have literature support . among the  <dig> novel cell cycle-regulated genes,  <dig> have no known function . these  <dig> uncharacterized genes may now be annotated as cell cycle related genes, supported by the fact that 68% of our predictions have literature support . furthermore, a high-confidence tf-gene regulatory matrix is derived as a byproduct of our method. each tf-gene regulatory relationship in this matrix is supported by at least three data sources: gene expression, tfbs, and chip-chip or/and mutant data. moreover, we compared the performance of our method with four existing methods and showed that our method has a better ability to retrieve the known cell cycle tfs. finally, applying our method to different cell cycle gene expression datasets, we identify similar sets of tfs, suggesting that our method is robust.
