BACKGROUND
the post-genomic era signals increased confidence in the possibility of locating quantitative trait loci  that underpin the heritability of common complex disorders. however, problems still remain and progress towards reliably detecting qtls for complex disorders, for which multiple genetic and environmental risk factors are responsible, has been slower than expected  <cit> . hypothesis-driven candidate gene studies are important, but with approximately  <dig>  genes in the human genome it is often difficult to predict how variation in gene product will affect a particular phenotype. moreover, it may be a mistake to limit the search for qtls to the 2% of the genome that codes for proteins, rather than using a genomewide strategy that considers non-coding as well as coding dna sequences  <cit> . linkage designs represent a genomewide approach but are limited to detecting qtls of relatively large effect size  <cit> . association designs are needed to provide genomewide searches for qtls of small effect size but hundreds of thousands of dna markers genotyped on samples of thousands of individuals are needed to detect qtls of small effect size  <cit> .

microarrays that permit highly multiplexed genotyping greatly reduce this genotyping burden. several companies have developed microarrays to meet the need for genomewide association analysis . in each case, single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the marker of choice because they are bi-allelic, abundant throughout the genome and relatively stable from generation to generation  <cit> . alleles of snps close together on a chromosome will be correlated  and thus they are also likely to be associated with a qtl in between them, known as indirect association  <cit> .

the number of snps required for an indirect genomewide association study depends on several factors, including recombination frequencies, effect size, and sample size <cit> . it is estimated however, that approximately  <dig>  'randomly chosen' snps or approximately  <dig>  well-chosen 'tag snps', which take into account patterns of linkage disequilibrium, are adequate to capture nearly all common variation in caucasian, han chinese, and japanese populations  <cit> .

with the advent of microarrays that genotype hundreds of thousands of snps, genomewide association studies are becoming a reality. for example, microarrays have been instrumental in genomewide association scans that discovered an intronic snp in complement factor h  causing age related macular degeneration  <cit> , and a non synonymous snp in il23r – a gene encoding a subunit of a proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- <dig> receptor – that confers susceptibility to crohn's disease  <cit> . however, these associations involve large effect sizes with odds ratios greater than  <dig> ; very large samples will be needed to detect smaller qtl effects.

the solution appears simple: use microarrays to genotype large cohorts for hundreds of thousands of snps. however, despite the high throughput of snp genotyping microarrays and the low cost per genotype, the cost of individually genotyping a sample of even  <dig> individuals remains prohibitive outside of large-scale consortia. until genotyping becomes even cheaper, one solution is to screen the genome using dna pools on microarrays to nominate snps. dna can be pooled for large samples of cases and controls or the low and high extremes of a quantitative trait and the pooled dna can be genotyped on snp microarrays, a method we call snpmicroarrays and dna pooling . the technique of dna pooling has been validated using both microsatellites  and snps  on several genotyping platforms, including the affymetrix  <dig> k microarray  <cit> ,  <dig> k microarray  <cit> , and one half of the two-chip  <dig> k microarray set  <cit> . the main advantage of dna pooling is that it provides average allele frequency estimates for a group rather than genotyping each individual in the group and then averaging their allele frequencies statistically. the main limitation is that individual genotypes and haplotypes cannot be extracted because the dna of individuals is pooled.

the confirmation of previously identified associations with rheumatoid arthritis have demonstrated the feasibility of snp-map case-control study designs for detecting susceptibility alleles to complex diseases  <cit> . furthermore, substantive studies have already used pooled dna across a variety of microarray platforms to detect novel snp associations. snp-map has been used as an initial screen in the identification of four susceptibility loci for mild mental impairment  <cit> ,  <dig> snps associated with reading ability  <cit> , and several snps, including an intronic snp from the diacylglycerol kinase eta  gene, associated with bipolar disorder  <cit> . these studies were performed using affymetrix  <dig> k, affymetrix  <dig> k and illumina humanhap <dig> microarrays, respectively. moreover, the affymetrix genechip® mapping  <dig> k array set has already been used to allelotype dna pools in substantive research, implicating a kibra-encoding locus in memory performance  <cit> .

in this report we evaluate the applicability of dna pools on the first truly genomewide, commercially available genotyping platform, the affymetrix  <dig> k genechip®, which affords significantly greater coverage of all common variation than do  <dig> k and  <dig> k arrays  <cit> . although already employed in substantive research, three subtle but potentially detrimental changes differentiating the affymetrix  <dig> k genechip® from its validated  <dig> k and  <dig> k predecessors, deem validation of the full  <dig> k set with pooled dna desirable. these changes are: 1) the introduction of two new restriction digest endonucleases, nspi and styi; 2) a decrease in feature size from  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm; and 3) a reduction from  <dig> to  <dig> probes per snp for 90% of the  <dig> k microarray.

to ascertain the reliability and validity of genomewide screening using dna pools, we assayed five previously validated, independent dna pools  separately on affymetrix genechip® mapping  <dig> k array sets. to assess reliability, the allele frequency estimates were compared across the five dna pools. to assess validity, the average allele frequency estimates across the five pools were compared with a ceph sample of  <dig> individuals from the hapmap project  <cit>  previously genotyped using the affymetrix  <dig> k genechip®.

RESULTS
detection rates
all five dna pools produced similar detection rates with the  <dig> k genechip®; rates varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for the sty array and  <dig>  to  <dig> % for the nsp array. these detection rates for the  <dig> k genechip® were similar to those from our previous work using pooled dna on the  <dig> k and  <dig> k genechip® platforms  <cit>  and only slightly less than for individual genotyping of the reference dna sample provided by affymetrix .

allele frequency estimation
rather than deriving separate ras scores for sense and anti-sense quartets, allele frequencies can be estimated more reliably using a composite measure. thus, allele frequency estimates were calculated using a modified form of the ras score algorithm  based upon an average of all quartet measures.

reliability
reliability was assessed by correlating allele frequency estimates across the five dna pools using the pearson correlation coefficient , as well as calculating their average absolute differences. as can be seen from table  <dig>  estimates of allele frequency across the  <dig> k microarray are highly reliable . the average correlation among the five dna pools was  <dig>  and their average absolute difference was  <dig> .

values are mean pearson correlation coefficients  between the  <dig> dna pools using the average of all quartet estimates . 'worst' and 'best' refer to the  <dig> bivariate comparisons between the  <dig> dna pools and 'average' is the average of these  <dig> correlations. values in parentheses are mean absolute differences between dna pools. 'all snps' includes all snps on the array  for which 70% of quartet measurements were available . 'maf > .05' only includes snps with minor allele frequency greater than . <dig> .

it is possible that these estimates of reliability are inflated by the inclusion of low frequency alleles; particularly in the case of non-polymorphic alleles when all snps are considered. to control for this we re-ran these analyses using only snps with maf > . <dig> . table  <dig> indicates similar results for correlations  and mean differences .

because we employ multiple biological replicates  without technical replicates it is difficult to decompose variance attributable to microarray measurement and pooling construction. however, a recent paper using one microarray of the two-microarray affymetrix  <dig> k set has estimated that the microarray component of variance is up to seven times greater than that of pool construction . given the relationship between  <dig> k and  <dig> k performance , we would expect to see similar estimates of microarray variance for the  <dig> k microarray.

validity
to assess validity, we compared our estimates of allele frequencies from pooled dna with individual genotyping data from an independent sample of  <dig> ceph individuals. all the ceph individuals  have been genotyped for snps on the affymetrix  <dig> k microarray; these data, which have been acquired using multiple genotyping platforms, are available for download from the hapmap project  <cit> . considering the small ceph sample size, table  <dig> indicates that the snp-map approach exhibited reasonable validity, reflected by high correlations  and modest mean differences  between each pool and the ceph population, with similar results for maf > . <dig>  we found no difference between array-type  on indices of reliability or validity, regardless of whether all snps or just common snps  were included.

values are average pearson correlation coefficients  between the allele frequency estimates dna pool and an independent population  of  <dig> individuals. 'worst' and 'best' refer to the  <dig> bivariate comparisons between the  <dig> dna pools and 'average' is the average of these  <dig> correlations. values in parentheses are mean absolute differences. 'all snps' includes all snps on the array including rare and non-polymorphic snps . 'maf > .05' only includes snps with minor allele frequency greater than . <dig> .

as expected, validity was further improved when all five dna sub-pool estimates were aggregated, supporting the use of multiple dna sub-pools in snp-map studies  <cit> . after excluding snps whose average minor allele frequency across the five pools was less than . <dig> or which had fewer than four pools, snp-map estimates correlated  <dig>   with the ceph population . standard errors of the mean  across at least four replicates were small  but were predictive of validity, with smaller variance across replicates indicating greater accuracy. we estimate that with at least 4– <dig> biological replicate dna pools, the snp-map method has 80% power to detect allele frequency differences between case and controls on the order of . <dig> for rarer alleles  and . <dig> for common alleles .

artificial pooling experiment as an indication of reliability
after the removal of rare alleles , the average correlation between the allele frequencies of two simulated biological replicate dna pools – each containing the individual genotypes of  <dig> unrelated individually genotyped ceph individuals – was calculated as  <dig> . this provides an expected correlation between two pools containing independent samples and no technical variance . although the difference between  <dig>  and  <dig>   is small, with a p-value of  <dig>  it is significantly different, however; this significance should be interpreted with caution as this is likely to reflect the sheer immensity of snps correlated and does not act as a summary statistic that can be used to quantify case-control allele frequency differences across the microarray.

reliability and validity of the  <dig> k genechip® versus  <dig> k genechip®
because the affymetrix  <dig> k genechip® mapping array shares  <dig>  probe-sets with the  <dig> k genechip®, we investigated how similar the two platforms performed with the same dna pools on the same snps. overall, the  <dig> k platform performed slightly less well than the  <dig> k platform both in terms of reliability and validity. using rasav-all, indices of reliability  for the  <dig> k microarray ranged from . <dig> to . <dig> , whereas for the  <dig> k these correlations ranged from . <dig> to . <dig> . this trend was mirrored in terms of validity when comparisons with the ceph population were considered .

discussion
the ability to screen common snps for allele frequency differences with dna pools is now feasible on a genomewide scale using the affymetrix  <dig> k genechip® mapping array. we allelotyped five previously validated dna pools on the  <dig> k microarray and show high reliability and validity for more than  <dig>  snps.

it is important to note that estimates of reliability and validity, although high, were lower than those obtained using the  <dig> k  <cit>  and  <dig> k  <cit>  platforms . comparing our previously published results for the  <dig> k platform versus the present results for the  <dig> k platform, the average reliability correlation was  <dig>  for the  <dig> k vs.  <dig>  for the  <dig> k ; the average validity correlation was  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  . a reduction in both feature size and in the number of features per snp may be accountable for this decline in performance from the  <dig> k array to the  <dig> k array. nonetheless, the performance of the  <dig> k array is adequate, especially in comparison to the basic sampling variation seen in our artificial pools using the individually genotyped ceph sample where no measurement error was present. concerns may arise with affymetrix's latest release, the snp array  <dig> , which sees all snps from the two-chip  <dig> k set, along with  <dig>  additional non-polymorphic probes which may be used to assess copy number variation, contained within a single microarray. as our analysis currently employs mis-match probe data, it remains to be seen if the reduction in the number of features per snp required for such multiplexing will further reduce the reliability and validity of pooled dna allele frequency estimates.

thus, we conclude that allele frequency estimates from dna pools appear reliable on the  <dig> k platform as well as  <dig> k and  <dig> k platforms to screen for allele frequency differences between groups. despite the reliability and validity found for pooled dna, three limitations of this study should be mentioned, which put these results in an even more favourable light. firstly, in terms of validity, these data are uncorrected for differential hybridisation kinetics, which can result in unequal representations of snp alleles  <cit> . this is unimportant for individual genotyping as allele-calling algorithms routinely process – and, in the case of homozygotes, actually benefit from – discordant allele fluorescence values. if dna pooling is used to estimate absolute allele frequencies, certain estimates will be biased when unequal allelic representation occurs. however, dna pooling is rarely used to estimate absolute allelic frequencies. dna pooling is usually used to assess relative differences between groups such as cases and control; previous reports of differential hybridisation  <cit>  indicating that the proportion of snps exhibiting differential hybridisation  is small, suggests all pools are subject to similar technical variation and thus allelic bias. a suitable next step however, is to identify the specific snps that exhibit large differential hybridisation and either omit these from subsequent analysis or correct in the appropriate manner .

secondly, the ceph population that we used to determine validity is a relatively small sample, which will have undoubtedly reduced estimates of validity. thirdly, reliability was assessed as the average difference between just one pool and another, rather than the difference between groups using multiple sub-pools for each group. it is therefore likely that our estimates of reliability are conservative underestimates, as may be inferred by the distribution of small sems.

dna pooling involves several limitations. with dna pooling it is not possible to extract individual genotypic information to allow analyses of individual differences or haplotypes. in addition, once individuals have been pooled they cannot be 'unpooled', thus tethering tests of allele frequency differences to the phenotype used for pooling  <cit> . however, these issues are offset by the considerable financial benefits of dna pooling.

as with individual genotyping, issues of multiple testing and false positive results are critical for genomewide association analyses using snp microarray. as one might expect, replication has been demonstrated to improve estimates of allele frequency, and therefore may be used to reduce, although by no means eliminate, the dilemma posed by false positive results  <cit> . although no consensus has yet been reached as to the fairest method of analysing the enormous volume of data generated by genome-wide studies, especially for identifying qtls of small effect size, progress with regard to high-throughput microarrays is being made  <cit> . regardless of which statistical procedures are agreed upon that demonstrate adequate association, the ultimate criterion for association must be independent replication. the expense of individually genotyping large samples using snp arrays makes replication of genomewide association scans unlikely. however, because dna pooling is relatively inexpensive, snp-map strategies will facilitate replication on a genomewide scale.

CONCLUSIONS
with results for reliability and validity similar to those previously demonstrated on  <dig> k and  <dig> k arrays, we have shown that the snp-map approach can be applied to a  <dig> k platform. we conclude that the affymetrix  <dig> k genechip® mapping array can be used in snp-map studies to provide an efficient, reliable, and valid genomewide screen of allele frequency differences between groups, thus facilitating the detection of snps of small effect size.
