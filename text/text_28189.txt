BACKGROUND
the contribution of epistasis on the genetic architecture of complex traits has been the focus of recent research in genetics, animals and plant breeding  <cit> . it has been widely discussed by carlborg and haley  <cit>  and mackay  <cit>  that there is evidence of strong participation of epistasis on the inheritance of quantitative traits. however, as emphasized by these authors, the search for statistical models that depict this genetic phenomenon in an efficient way is very challenging, whether by the supposition about the epistasis distribution in the genome or by its definition, which is exceptionally controversial  <cit> .

regarding the definition of epistasis, this term was initially described by bateson  <cit>  to explain the observed deviation from the expected mendelian segregation, where an allele from a particular locus might interact with other alleles at different loci. in other words, instead of occurring only in intra-locus interactions, bateson suggested that alleles from different loci may interact with each other to under- or overexpress particular genes. although the above definition is very simple, it was critical in genetics research, and starting from this claim, several others definitions emerged  <cit> .

currently, there are different interpretations of epistasis, and these divergences have caused some confusion  <cit> . for example, geneticists have used the term “epistasis” to describe three different events: i) the functional relation among two or more genes, ii) genetic ordering in regulatory pathways and iii) deviation from the additivity in the effect of alleles at different loci in relation to their contribution to a quantitative phenotype. in a similar way, phillips  <cit>  classified three types of epistasis: i) functional or molecular epistasis, where proteins or other gene products from different genes interact with each other in metabolic pathways, ii) compositional epistasis, which is related to the classical view of epistasis, where one allele from a specific locus can interfere with the expression of other loci, namely, it is individual-specific, and iii) statistical epistasis, which sir ronald fisher adopted as an average deviation from allelic combination expected by mendelian segregation for different loci in a population. this last one is the most studied in quantitative genetics due to the high genetic complexity involving quantitative traits, and therefore, the estimates of compositional epistasis become unfeasible in traits controlled by several loci  <cit> .

regarding the distribution of epistasis in the genome, it has been suggested that there is a “universal epistasis”; in other words, gene interactions could be more pervasive than supposed by quantitative geneticists, playing an important role in the genetic control of the traits  <cit> . for example, these authors observed that more than half of the qtl effects found in yeast mapping were modified by other qtl, presenting marginal or non-significant effects. this result indicates that mapping studies may underestimate the real role of epistasis in complex traits  <cit> .

mackay  <cit>  presented a similar discussion about the importance of epistasis, highlighting the hypothesis of “universal epistasis” as a nuisance for specific epistasis detection in statistical models. in both works, mackay suggests the influence of “pervasive” epistasis on so-called “missing heritability”; namely, considering only additive effects and their interactions, the observed broad-sense heritability may be much higher than expected. in this case, artificial selection could be challenging, and the introduction of new alleles in a new background may lead to results that are contrary to those expected  <cit> . moreover, the genome selection based on the prediction of additive effects may not be useful if the allelic frequencies in the reference population are different from those in the test population.

in this sense, it becomes evident that quantification of epistatic effects plays a fundamental role in genomic studies. phillips  <cit>  suggested that epistatic effects could be investigated over the full genome, i.e., take into account exhaustive pairwise combinations of genes. the biggest problem with this approach is related to the number of epistatic combinations when there are several candidate loci, i.e., considering n qtl, one can expect  epistatic combinations of first order without taking into account its interaction type . in other words, if the geneticist works with  <dig> qtl, it is necessary to exploit  <dig>  interactions and to take into account all types of epistasis, this number rises to  <dig>  allelic interactions. currently, genome-wide studies have used a significant number of data points , which makes it difficult to exploit universal epistasis in multiple marker models.

although methods to estimate major effects of qtl or markers in oversaturated maps has increased in the last few years, models considering the inclusion of marker interactions in the genomic analysis are scarce  <cit> . learning strategies have been applied for epistasis estimates in the context of big data, such as machine learning  decision trees  <cit> , information theory  <cit>  and multifactor dimensionality reduction   <cit> . in the statistical framework, mixed models based on likelihood inference have been used to estimate epistatic effects using animal models and epistatic g-blup based on genomic additive and dominant matrices. in these models, the pairwise epistasis effects are ignored, and only the genomic epistatic values are taken into account for genomic prediction  <cit> . other approaches have estimated epistasis using markers with high marginal effects, which cannot explore minor epistatic interactions and the universal epistasis hypothesis  <cit> .

another interesting approach to estimate epistasis was proposed by ronnegard and valdar  <cit>  and ronnegard and lee  <cit>  using double hierarchical generalized linear models  to capture vqtl. these vqtl can partially retrieve epistasis signals, but it is not sufficiently informative about which loci are involved in the interactions controlling the traits or what type of epistasis is present in each interaction.

using bayesian inference, xu  <cit>  and xu and jia  <cit>  studied first-order epistasis in multiples markers and showed the power of empirical bayes approach to identify qtl. however, the exhaustive pairwise combination proposed by these authors is feasible only by a small number of markers and may be computationally intractable in a genome-wide context. because the actual statistical models can easily handle a high number of markers, the main challenge is to include epistatic interactions without strongly altering the model dimension. an alternative is the use of bayesian strategies, which enable us to identify epistatic interactions without severely changing the model size. in other words, the model dimension could be modified during the monte carlo markov chain process  rather than considering all epistatic interactions in a final oversaturated model. in this scenario, the model dimension can be increased or decreased in each sampling cycle by inserting or deleting epistasis using probability rules. in this context, the reversible-jump  <cit>  method could be used as a powerful tool for epistasis scans in the genome-wide analysis, mainly, when the model dimension is truncated over the markers but the number of epistatic loci is allowed to vary in its space.

the reversible-jump monte carlo markov chain  technique has been successfully applied in genome studies when the number of qtl is unknown . however, none of these works use rjmcmc to exhaustively determine epistatic interactions. thus, this work was proposed to examine the efficiency of reversible-jump when there are thousands of candidate epistases in the genome analysis using simulated and real datasets.

RESULTS
simulated study
the results related to the simulated study revealed that our model presents a good ability to find qtl with genetic additive and dominant effects . in this study, the qtl were named according to the marker interval where they were identified or simulated. two out of six principal qtl were found on the exact simulated position ; one was found at 19 cm away from the simulated qtl , and one marker presented a non-significant peak. actually, the lod =  <dig>  at the fourth red dot. our analysis did not find two out of the six simulated qtl in linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  one epistatic qtl was identified presenting as a principal effect; in other words, this qtl was simulated presenting only epistatic effects and null for additive and dominant ones. thus, the false discovery rate  in our study for qtl could be considered  <dig> out of  <dig> because the single peak showing one false discovery for principal qtl was actually an epistatic one. the same pattern was observed for the epistatic qtl localized at the intervals  <dig> and  <dig>  but the observed peak was not significant. the strong shrinkage effect observed in our method can be verified by the number of peaks  in a total of  <dig> simulated markers . the larger peak shown in this figure could be considered a spurious qtl because none of the simulated qtl were simulated in that position.fig.  <dig> genomic profile for qtl in seven simulated linkage groups using rjmcmc  and empirical bayes . red dots represent the non-epistatic qtl, and blue dots represent the simulated epistatic qtl. the dotted line represents the lod criterion 




when the simulated example was analyzed by the proc qtl program based on empirical bayes, the results were very different from our methodology. although both methods found some simulated qtl, the empirical bayes captured more epistatic qtl in the genomic profile than that of non-epistatic qtl, presenting two false positives. our method presented the opposite result, highlighting non-epistatic qtl in the genome profile. on the other hand, the empirical bayes showed a highlighted peak in a true qtl, whereas our method was in a false positive. thus, both methods showed different genomic profiles, but rjmcmc was more efficient in the control of false positives.

in fig.  <dig>  one can observe the heat-map for the length of the rjmcmc chain in epistatic qtl. all epistatic interactions were visited at least once, but one qtl presented a prominent chain size . in other words, this qtl was included during the mcmc process, and practically, it was not deleted in further mcmc sampling. this pair of qtl, named 18x <dig>  was very close to true qtl, names here named as 19x25; the qtl peaks were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm away from qtl  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the other five green dots represent the qtl with larger chains when compared to other candidates.fig.  <dig> heat map for epistatic qtl and chain size in the reversible jumping process. the more red the epistatic intensity is, the more time the qtl was retained in the mcmc process, meaning its effect on the epistatic complex is more likely




to summarize the heat-map, we selected the epistases presenting final chain length up to  <dig> and found that four of these epistases presented lod >  <dig> . furthermore, only one spurious epistasis was found, but the marker interval representing this false epistasis  was practically that determined individually for other true simulated epistases . in this figure, the estimate of epistasis, which was closer to the true simulated epistases  was that represented by the combination interval 59x <dig>  presenting a genetic distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm from simulated 59x <dig>  respectively, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm from 59x <dig>  respectively. furthermore, estimated epistasis 52x <dig> was very close to the simulated 54x <dig>  presenting a distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm.fig.  <dig> selected epistatic effects based on chain length . the simulated qtl were 19x <dig>  54x <dig>  59x <dig> and 59x94




figure  <dig> represents the raw 3d plot for all retained epistases. in this figure, it is possible to observe that all epistatic interactions were visited at least once. however, this graph is not reliable because the epistases were compared only with their lod magnitude and not by their constancy in the model. to avoid false epistasis discovery, we used a 3d plot weighted by the length of the chain. using the weighted lod, we obtained a high-resolution graph . in this figure, the symmetry is evident between the simulated epistasis 19x <dig>  54x <dig>  59x <dig> and 59x <dig> and the estimated one 18x <dig>  56x <dig>  and 59x <dig>  however, “ghost” epistases were also observed . overall, by the results from the simulated data, we can infer that our method was satisfactory for the identification of major qtl and presented a real ability to identify epistasis.fig.  <dig> 3d plot for raw epistatic effects of each qtl in the simulated study

on the other hand, the xu  <cit>  and xu and jia  <cit>  method was not effective for finding true epistasis. several false positives were found, although no false negatives were observed .

real maize dataset
in the real maize dataset, eight qtl of larger principal effect were found . these qtl are distributed across five linkage groups and, in general, presented higher dominance effects over the additive ones . it is evident that the dominance effects were superior to the additives ones, indicating a possible effect of heterosis acting on the grain yield in maize. although the number of major qtl was relatively small, the number of epistatic qtl found was slightly higher  . again, the dominance effects were highlighted in the epistasis interactions, and it becomes more evident when we observe the magnitude of dominant-dominant epistasis acting in the control of this trait. most of the epistatic interactions were concentrated in the 1st, 2nd, and 5th linkage groups. the 8th linkage group also presented a high qtl epistatic effect related to additive-dominant and additive-additive interactions.fig.  <dig> genomic profile for qtl across the  <dig> linkage groups for grain yield in real maize data. the lod score criterion was lod = 3

in fig.  <dig>  one can observe eight main qtl peaks. clearly, not all linkage groups showed any major or epistatic qtl. in other words, in this study, linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed no qtl.

several epistatic qtl presented constancy in the model during the rjmcmc process. however, contrary to the lod scores observed in the simulation study, the lod scores for these qtl were very low. thus, among all epistatic effects found in our model applied to the real dataset, only five epistases had a chain length larger than  <dig> and an lod score greater than  <dig>  no qtl with smaller chain size presented lod scores greater than  <dig> .fig.  <dig> selected epistatic effects based on chain length for grain yield in real maize data 




in fig.  <dig>  one can observe the full picture regarding the length of chains in the rjmcmc process. a different scenario was noted from the simulated study concerning the chain length. in other words, in the simulated study, we observe few epistatic qtl presenting a long chain and a small number of red dots in the heat map. in the real dataset, on the other hand, the heat map showed several hot spots, indicating that various epistatic qtl of lower effect may act in the genetic control of maize grain yield. for example, the significant qtl presented dominant-by-dominant epistatic variance equal to  <dig> , and the non-significant epistatic variance was  <dig> . the additive variance was, by magnitude, only 30% of this amount . this magnitude may be compared to other variance components. for example, the dominance variance in this study was  <dig> , and epistatic additive-additive, additive-dominant and dominant-additive were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the total genetic variance was  <dig> , and the residual variance was  <dig> .fig.  <dig> heat map for epistatic qtl and chain size in the reversible jumping process for grain yield trait in real maize data. the redder the epistatic intensity is, the more time the qtl was retained in the mcmc process, meaning its participation in the epistatic complex is more likely




more than five epistatic combinations presented lod >  <dig>  fourteen epistatic interactions and  <dig> different qtl were related to these orange/red peaks. however, only five interactions presented a chain length > <dig>  in this figure, it is evident that all epistatic combinations were visited and incorporated at least once into the model during the rjmcmc process . in the weighted 3d plot , it is possible to observe five high interactions based on their red/orange peaks. differing from that observed in the simulated dataset, the shrinkage effect related to maize data was not as intense as that observed in simulated data; because of this, several minor epistatic effects could be observed in this plot. additionally, the same epistatic interactions previously identified as promising  were also established in this plot .fig.  <dig> 3d plot for raw lod epistatic effects for the grain yield in the maize data set

figure  <dig> presents the final estimate of the genetic architecture and the results of the 5-fold analysis. obviously, this naïve network does not represent the real scenario of the genetic architecture for maize grain yield. however, it is useful for observing the qtl presenting high importance and their relation to other significant qtl. for example, qtl  <dig> is related to three different epistatic interactions, and although it has no significant major effect , its importance for grain yield is evident because it appeared in all cross-validation analyses. the only qtl showing relevant epistatic and high main effects was “qtl 19”, localized in linkage group  <dig>  but this qtl did not appear in all cross-validation scenarios.fig.  <dig> complex epistatic network for grain yield  in maize considering principal and epistatic qtl . the top principal graph was built by the full dataset, and the five sub-graphs were built by 5-fold analysis




discussion
the main challenge in genome-wide models is dealing with high dimension matrices related to marker information. in other words, if n is related to the number of phenotyped individuals and p is related to the number of markers, it is evident that, if p > = n
, a simple regression analysis is restrictive to estimate marker effects. the inclusion of two-way epistasis makes p ≫ n
, and the analysis becomes prohibitive by classical least square methods and computationally intractable by multiple markers approaches. in our simulation study, even using only  <dig> markers, the number of additive and dominant effects in regression models was  <dig> in each interval . furthermore, for each type of epistasis, there are  <dig>  possible interactions, and using all combinations, i.e., additive-additive, additive-dominance, dominance-additive and dominance-dominance, there are a total of  <dig>  epistases plus  <dig> main effects, totaling  <dig>  estimates. for the real dataset, we explore  <dig>  epistatic effects plus  <dig> additive and dominant.

because this space is not so high in our models, it was possible to visit all candidate interactions and select marker intervals very close to the simulated epistatic qtl. in addition, the maximal model dimension observed during the mcmc process corresponded to  <dig> effects, that is, the highest number of epistatic interactions running simultaneously on the model was equal to eight, allowing a high computational efficiency, presenting a computational difference from the model without epistasis for only 360 s.

in the simulation study, the power of our analysis to find the main qtl was satisfactory in the sense that our model had overlooked only two out six simulated principal qtl . an interesting result is the presence of peaks in the genomic profile where the simulated epistatic qtl did not present any principal effect. this type of “cloud effect” is discussed extensively by carlborg and haley  <cit> , and it is defined as “co-adaptative epistasis”, i.e., the pairs of epistatic markers present some biological advantage when the loci are in homozygosis, although the individual markers do not present a significant effect per se. this qtl  localized on chromosome  <dig> was not simulated with this intent. however, because we simulated high negative dominant epistasis and low additive-additive, when the individuals were homozygous, it presented some advantages for this locus, and for this reason, this locus was identified as a “true” principal qtl. this “cloud effect” was observed  for other epistatic qtl across the genomic profile.

the success of the analysis could be evaluated by the length of the chains for the simulated epistatic qtl, i.e., whether the true qtl are retained in the model during the mcmc process. in our study, the simulated qtl were well represented by their neighboring markers, which in turn presented a long chain compared to other candidate intervals. the only spurious epistatic interaction  actually captured the simulated epistatic qtl  <dig> and  <dig>  this “ghost effect” is expected because these markers are very close each other; actually, the average distance between these markers is approximately  <dig>  cm. these also explain the significant epistasis 59x <dig> instead of the simulated ones 59x <dig> and 59x <dig> 

as mentioned above, the raw lod score presents a low resolution to identify the epistatic pattern. it may occur when the pairwise qtl effects present a high lod score but, on the other hand, a small chain and a poor mixture in the posterior. thus, high values of lod could exhibit a leverage effect on the lod means. in this regard, our ad hoc approach was effective for cleaning spurious epistatic effects on the model, achieving a better resolution in the lod plot. furthermore, this “trick” presents a special concordance with the results presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  consequently, we recommended the two stage plot, that is, to first use the truncated graph based on chain size  and further select markers presenting with lod above  <dig> instead of using the lod score and further weighting these lod by chain size.

the empirical bayes approach proposed by xu  <cit>  was utilized for comparison because it is one of the few that performs exhaustive searching in the epistatic space and estimates all epistasis combinations . although empirical bayes and rjmcmc present similar proposals, our method performs particularly better than xu’s  <cit>  method for searching epistatic effects. the differences in power and false positive rate in major qtl analyses were marginal between these two approaches. however, the superiority of our technique for finding true epistasis using the lod over the chain size is evident. both methods found several false peaks in the raw analysis, but given that in rjmcmc the size of the chain is determinant and can be used as probabilistic criterion to select epistasis, a high-resolution analysis could be obtained .

other methods could also be used to compare with rjmcmc, but most of them do not follow our proposal, that is, they do not estimate all candidate epistases and/or do not operate effectively in the interaction space. if so, they need to use ad hoc procedures, such as multi-stage analysis, by screening major markers  <cit> .

although the xu  <cit>  method is very attractive to the user because it is available in a friendly sas macro and any programmer with basic knowledge of sas can easily operate the program, it is very restrictive when several markers are included in the analysis. for example, when we used  <dig> markers in our simulation, the program did not work properly, and it was not possible to estimate the  <dig>  epistases. for this reason, it was not possible to compare it with our method, which worked very well in this scenario. therefore, all results related to this simulation were inserted as supplemental material . some observations can be drawn from this simulation scenario with  <dig> markers: 1) most of the simulated epistases were found with low genetic distance from the simulated ones, but the sizes of the chains were not safely high enough to make inferences because it presented as a poor mixture during mcmc ; 2) using  <dig>  iterations, it was possible to explore 86% of the  <dig>  possible epistases, which shows that the number of sampling in rjmcmc can be a limiting factor ; 3) among the epistases selected by the same aforementioned criteria, some had low genetic distance from the simulated epistasis ; 4) the model was very effective for finding the principal qtl . therefore, these results show that it is possible to estimate major and epistatic effects in a one stage model, but some precautions are necessary to regulate the number of iterations in rjmcmc.

an issue of our method that must be discussed refers to the inclusion or deletion of full epistatic terms in the decision rules  instead of the isolated epistatic effects in the model. we think sampling isolated effects may be less efficient for rjmcmc because some qtl can be true epistatic, with at least one epistatic effect as true, but present a null effect for an isolated interaction. in this scenario, more rounds of mcmc could be necessary. in addition, given that the whole epistatic effect in the pair of qtl presents a bayes factor of less than one, there is no reason to test the isolated effects.

in the real dataset, although lod scores selected only five epistasis effects, some epistases presenting minor importance were kept in the model. this result confirms the complexity involving the epistasis related to grain yield in maize and the difficulty of finding pairwise markers controlling this trait  <cit> . for example, the most important marker interval found in our work was related to qtl  <dig> and qtl  <dig>  qtl  <dig> is localized inside the marker interval bnlg1720-umc <dig> localized on linkage group  <dig>  this marker is localized on chromosome  <dig> in the maize genome, and its interval ranges from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,990 bp . several qtl have been reported in this bin. for example, frascaroli et al.  <cit>  found some epistatic effects among intervals including the marker bnlg <dig> 

the more relevant epistatic interval was related to umc1365-bnlg <dig>  although this result could be considered as encouraging, it is evident that the genomic window between these markers is vast, ranging from bins  <dig>  to  <dig>  and presenting approximately 34 cm of distance  <cit> . the genetic distance between the found qtl and the umc <dig> marker was approximately  <dig>  cm; using a naïve approach, it corresponds to a physical distance of  <dig>  mpb  <cit> . therefore, the corresponding region for this qtl in chromosome  <dig> is approximately  <dig>  mpb. it is worth highlighting that, between the regions  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp, several genes are found to be expressed in different cycles of maize crops  <cit>  .

the k-fold analysis of the real dataset revealed what was expected, that is, that the rjmcmc method finds a local maximum in the epistatic space, which becomes evident when we look at the different interrelations among the qtl and phenotypes across the cv analysis . however, an encouraging result is that the most important qtl were very stable over the unbalanced process.

the “pervasive epistasis” hypothesis suggested by mackay  <cit>  may explain the result observed in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> and also the importance of epistatic effects on the genetic variance in this study. when pervasive epistasis is present on a quantitative trait, mackay notes the so-called missing heritability acting on the trait, hampering the genetic progress in artificial selection  <cit> . thus, using a model that simultaneously includes additive, dominant and epistatic effects on all pairwise markers, geneticists can exploit the genetic architecture to avoid poor genomic predictions.

the searching strategy for epistasis has been proposed by several authors in genome-wide studies to incorporate its effects into the model  <cit> . however, several of these methods are based on undirected epistasis estimates for multistage strategies; in these circumstances, the genetic architecture may not be correctly depicted. xu  <cit>  and xu and jia  <cit>  proposed an epistatic model where additive marker effects and epistasis are incorporated into the model. in a total of  <dig> and  <dig> markers used by these authors, the xu method recovered only  <dig>  and  <dig>  pairs of epistatic interactions, respectively. our method presents some similarities to the xu approach in the sense that all pairwise epistasis interactions are estimated. however, our model may be more desirable because all pairs of epistasis may be visited without significantly increasing the model. the method applied here could be extended to other branches of genomics. for example, in microarray models, independence is assumed among the genes across the data, which forces a sparse matrix to facilitate estimates of case–control contrasts. one strategy would be to apply rjmcmc in the sparse covariance matrix relaxing to an assumption of independence among genes.

the main difficulty related to our analysis was separating the principal and epistatic qtl in a marker interval; specifically, the qtl position in the epistasis marker interval was not always the same as that of the principal one. for example, for qtl  <dig>  the main effect was  <dig>  cm away from umc <dig>  and the epistatic one was  <dig>  cm away from this marker. this difficulty may be overcome with an oversaturated genome as obtained in genome-wide studies; in other words, using the markers per se instead of the marker intervals. in this situation, the epistasis might be obtained by pairwise markers, and the problem of qtl position could be avoided. however, as more markers are inserted into the model, the length of the mcmc chain necessary to visit all pairs of epistasis becomes enormous and, in this case, markers bins may be requested for epistasis estimates  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our work provides useful results related to epistasis studies using statistical models. it is evident that, in a saturated genomic framework , the results could be more practical, for example, in the genome-wide selection or gwas context. however, because the qtl searching models are more sophisticated than genome-wide regression models, a slight change in our approach could enable it to be applied in genome-wide association studies or genome scanning for qtl in structured populations.
