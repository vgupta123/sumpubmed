BACKGROUND
chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of non specific urethritis in the industrialised world, and the major infectious cause of preventable blindness  in the third world  <cit> . c. trachomatis can be divided into at least  <dig> serovars or serotypes, distinguished by ompa sequencing  <cit> , which are associated with different disease pathologies  <cit> . serotypes a, b, ba and c are generally associated with blinding trachoma and serotypes d to k cause non-disseminating sexually transmitted infections. these  <dig> serotypes are all naturally restricted to infection of genital or ocular epithelial cells and have not been observed to be invasive  <cit> . by contrast, serotypes l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> cause a rare invasive and systemic sexually transmitted infection normally found in the tropics, known as lymphogranuloma venereum   <cit> .

in october  <dig> a new variant of c. trachomatis was described in sweden that evaded several of the then current commercial molecular diagnostic tests for detecting the microorganism, which were based on the presence of specific plasmid sequences  <cit> . a deletion of  <dig> bp of plasmid dna, in the region used for nucleic acid amplification tests , is responsible for the negative diagnoses  <cit> . all new variant strains of c. trachomatis belong to serotype e  <cit> . failure to detect the plasmid and hence treat those infected with the new variant has led to a significant increase in cases, and in some swedish counties  <dig> – 64% of current infections are caused by this strain of c. trachomatis  <cit> .

strains of c. trachomatis have a highly conserved small genome of approximately  <dig> mb and harbour a plasmid of approximately  <dig> kb  <cit> . some plasmid-free isolates of c. trachomatis have been described, but these are exceedingly rare and the only viable clinical isolates described that are plasmid free belong to serotypes l <dig>  d and e  <cit> . the c. trachomatis plasmids sequenced to date each contain eight predicted coding sequences , along with a set of four  <dig> bp repeats which is understood to be the origin of replication  <cit> . characterization of plasmid functions and of chlamydial genes in general has been greatly impeded by the lack of a genetic system for studying c. trachomatis  <cit>  and so little is known about the function of these cdss beyond in silico predictions of function for  <dig> cdss and the observation that the cds previously designated orf <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> kda  when expressed in escherichia coli  <cit> . however, the role of pgp <dig> in the chlamydial developmental cycle and the overall biological function of the plasmid remains unknown.

since the study of c. trachomatis genes is hampered by the lack of any molecular tools with which to manipulate strains, the emergence of the new variant strain and naturally occurring mutants provides an opportunity to investigate the evolution of the plasmids and to determine whether the evolutionary pathway of these plasmids matches that of the chromosome. in this study the nature and extent of chromosome and plasmid variation in c. trachomatis has been investigated. to extend the current dataset, two isolates of the previously unsequenced serotype b were completely sequenced, as were four plasmids from swedish strains belonging to serotypes e and f, including that of the new variant strain. the plasmid is useful as a target for diagnostic testing because it is relatively stable and hence more resistant to nuclease damage than the genome, and present at up to ten copies per genome  <cit> . thus a detailed knowledge of the sequence conservation and the stability of chlamydial plasmids will be critically informative in determining whether the plasmid is a reliable target for future diagnostic tests.

RESULTS
genome sequences of serotype a and b isolates of c. trachomatis
the genomes of two serotype b ocular isolates of c. trachomatis were sequenced. these provide the first high quality genome sequences of ocular isolates: b/tz1a828/ot and b/jali20/ot , summarised in table  <dig>  whole genome comparisons showed that the genomes are highly syntenic, and that there are no whole gene differences between the strains. the pairwise mean nucleotide identity between orthologous genes is  <dig> %. a comparison of the genomes against that of c. trachomatis serotype a strain a/har- <dig>  sequenced by microarray  <cit>  showed no insertions or deletions of predicted coding sequences .

the snp comparisons have been made to the serotype a reference strain a/har- <dig> 

previous microarray and sequencing studies have shown that almost all sequence and gene variation distinguishing serotypes of c. trachomatis from each other are restricted to a region at the terminus of replication known as the plasticity zone   <cit> . it was demonstrated by microarray and pcr analysis that a strain belonging to serotype b lacked most of the genes found within this region  <cit> . however, analysis of the serotype b isolates sequenced for this study showed that they possess many of the cdss found within the pz . these include cytotoxin gene fragments, remnants of a much larger cytotoxin gene which is thought to have been similar to those still found intact in c. muridarum  <cit> . in a strain of c. trachomatis serotype d, a remnant of the cytotoxin gene is expressed, and is cytotoxic on hela cells  <cit> . consistent with previous analysis of the pz, the phospholipase d genes display high levels of disruption in both serotype b strains  <cit> . the pz also encompasses the trprba operon, which has been found to be functional only in genital isolates, and to carry mutations in ocular strains  <cit> . this operon is non-functional in both the strains presented here, with either the trpb  or trpa  being disrupted .

despite there being no whole gene differences between the strains, analysis of the genomes identified several pseudogene differences when they were compared to each other and also with the genomes of other c. trachomatis serotypes and biovariants a/har- <dig> and the serotype l <dig> strain l2/434/bu . eleven of the disrupted cdss are common to both serotype b strains, whereas only one of these is common also to a/har_ <dig> and l2/434/bu . the equivalent putative membrane proteins ctb_0571/jali_ <dig> contain different inactivating mutations: a single base deletion causing a frameshift after codon  <dig> , or a single nucleotide polymorphism  prematurely truncating the protein after codon  <dig> . another example of a cds with distinct inactivating mutations is the putative exported protein jali_1341/cta_ <dig>  this cds carries a frameshift mutation in jali <dig>  and is truncated by a premature stop codon leading to a loss of  <dig> amino acids from the c terminus in a/har- <dig> 

inclusion proteins are an important family of chlamydial proteins, associated with virulence, which target the host inclusion membrane. consequently, the inactivation of cdss ctb_ <dig> and jali_ <dig> encoding candidate inclusion membrane proteins may have implications with regard to how the cell interacts with the host. this cds has been disrupted by an identical snp creating a stop codon after codon  <dig> in both strains, with jali_ <dig> having undergone a further single base insertion and deletion at other sites to create two additional frameshifts. another notable difference is the variation in the sequence of the secf gene, which is present as a full length gene in the serotype b strains, but is found as two separate cdss secd/secf in a/har- <dig>  <cit> . a further functional loss is the operon comprising pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase and arginine/ornithine antiporter, involved in ph homeostasis. the antiporter  is disrupted in the serotype a and b strains, the decarboxylase  is disrupted in l2/434/bu, whereas the operon is intact in the serotype d strain d/uw-3/cx  <cit> .

set against a high level of sequence identity , some predicted cdss display higher levels of variation . as has been noted before, these include ompa, which is used to distinguish between serotypes  <cit> , tarp, encoding the translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein  <cit> , and hctb, encoding histone-like hc <dig>  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of c. trachomatis genomes
the first genome-scale, snp-based phylogenetic analysis of all six available c. trachomatis genomes was carried out, covering serotypes a, b, d, l <dig> and l2b . comparative genome analysis identified  <dig>  snps, of which the large majority define splits between the three major groups . monophyly of lgv strains is supported by  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps unite the three ocular strains and  <dig> are unique to the genital, serotype d strain. these splits are also strongly supported in the results of the phylogenetic analysis of the snps, using a general time reversible model of evolution and four discrete gamma distributed rate categories to account for among site rate variation. pairwise comparisons of the genomes by snp numbers also confirms this clustering . within the ocular strains, the two serotype b isolates cluster together, suggesting that serotypes are identifiable on the basis of snp phylogenies. these data are derived from the genomes of six isolates , whilst the numbers are small they reflect the same patterns of genome evolution observed using fragments of the genome  <cit>  and our data using complete genomes are strong enough to support these associations, although further studies would be beneficial to confirm these findings when the technology will allow rapid easy purification of genomes from these obligate intracellular pathogens.

phylogenetic analysis of c. trachomatis plasmids
the plasmid sequences from the strains ctb and jali <dig> were assembled from the genome shotgun. to investigate the new variant strain which evaded diagnosis, isolates from epithelial sexually transmitted infections  from the city of malmo in sweden were included. genital tract isolates representing the new variant c. trachomatis  and three concurrently isolated strains  were selected. to represent plasmids from other chlamydial serotypes, plasmid sequences were obtained from genbank covering further trachoma and lgv strains .

alignment of these  <dig> plasmid sequences showed that there are  <dig> snp locations, representing approximately  <dig> % variation. six of these occur in intergenic locations. the snps and their effects on coding sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  each plasmid is unique and identifiable by the presence of at least one snp and/or indel . only two snps, at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  , allow differentiation of the chlamydial plasmids into lgv, trachoma and genital tract groupings. most of the snps are located within cdss and there is no significant clustering of snps within the plasmid. only one non-synonymous mutation occurs within cds <dig> which may suggest that this gene is under strong selection. analysis of the informative snps and indels allowed phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationships between the plasmids . the resulting phylogenetic tree shows that the chlamydial plasmids segregate into tight groupings reflecting the phenotypes of their host bacteria. the lgv plasmids are the most distantly related, with the sti and ocular strain plasmids having apparently diverged at a later time.

comparative phylogenetics of complete genomes and plasmids
a comparison of the phylogenies of the genomes and plasmids is given in figure  <dig>  of the serotype a, b, l <dig> and l2b strains, for which both complete genome and plasmid sequence sets exist, and serotype d for which there are independent complete genome and plasmid sequences, the phylogenies mirror each other. the complete genomes and plasmids from the lgv strains cluster tightly, as do those from the ocular strains, and the sti strains branch from these and also cluster together.

these data suggest that the chlamydial plasmids have not been freely exchanged, but have remained closely linked to their cognate host chromosome .

analysis of the new variant plasmid
the plasmid with the most variation  was found in strain sweden <dig>  however, psw <dig> still belongs to the genital tract lineage and therefore has not appeared as result of a transfer event. the complete nucleotide sequence of psw <dig> comprises  <dig>  bp,  <dig> bp smaller than the  <dig>  bp plasmid  from strain sweden <dig>  sweden <dig> could be hypothesised to be the potential progenitor strain of sweden <dig> because they have identical sequences of the chromosomal ompa gene. the difference in size between psw <dig> and psw <dig> is accounted for by a deletion of  <dig> bp and a duplication of  <dig> bp at a different locus . psw <dig> is the smallest chlamydial plasmid described, some  <dig> bp smaller than the previously smallest known chlamydial plasmid, pcpne <dig> , which is from an equine strain of c. pneumoniae  <cit> .

the  <dig> bp deletion within psw <dig> is situated within cds <dig>  creating a frameshift which shortens the predicted protein from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and removing a primer binding site for the diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests . this region of the plasmid was originally selected as the target for several commercial diagnostic naats and the new variant strain became established because infection by this strain went undetected and hence untreated  <cit> . plasmid pl <dig> from strain l2/434/bu contains a single nucleotide deletion within cds <dig>   <cit>  leading to a truncated cds <dig> protein . pcpne <dig> also has a deletion within cds <dig>  but the location is different to that within psw <dig> and the effect is to create two small putative cdss, which are unlikely to be functional.

the observation of cds <dig> as a region of the plasmid apparently prone to inactivation and therefore potentially dispensable may be explained by the possible functional redundancy between the proteins encoded by cds <dig> and cds <dig>  these proteins have similar sizes , share 35% amino acid sequence identity, and both match to the pfam domain pf <dig> , suggesting some functional equivalence  <cit> .

a second difference between the psw <dig> and the other c. trachomatis plasmids is a  <dig> bp perfect tandem duplication, located immediately upstream of both cds <dig> and cds <dig>  which are divergently transcribed. the transcription start points  for cds <dig> and cds <dig>  have been mapped previously  <cit>  and are both located within this  <dig> bp section. the duplication of the tsp could potentially boost cds <dig> expression. both the deletion in cds <dig> and the  <dig> bp duplication are unique to psw <dig>  and no intermediate plasmid carrying either of the mutations separately has been identified. this could indicate that these changes are related events, and that potential up-regulation of cds <dig> may compensate for the loss of a functional product from cds <dig> 

candidate plasmid regions for improved diagnostic targets
when all c. trachomatis plasmid cdss from the eleven complete nucleotide sequences were compared, cds <dig> was found to be the most highly conserved. although there are eleven snps within the coding sequence, only one results in an amino acid change , suggestive of a functional requirement. this snp , present in psw <dig> and psw <dig>  is at the extreme carboxy terminus of the protein. a further constraint on variation within cds <dig> is the presence of two short rna molecules , which are complementary to the 3' terminus of the primary transcript encoding cds <dig>  <cit> . these two short 'antisense' transcripts are differentially expressed during the developmental cycle. this level of sequence conservation, possibly tied to an essential function, suggests that the region of the plasmid encompassing cds <dig> would be a good target for future screening.

cds <dig>  cds <dig> and cds <dig> also show high levels of amino acid conservation. cds <dig>  is the smallest plasmid encoded protein and contains a single snp. the proteins encoded by cds <dig> and cds <dig> display homology to proteins involved in the process of plasmid partitioning  <cit> , and have been shown to be active at cell division. these proteins may play an important role for these relatively low copy number plasmids, ensuring that each daughter cell acquires an equal number of plasmid copies.

the protein predicted to be encoded by cds <dig>  previously designated orf  <dig>  has the largest number of non-synonymous snps. there are  <dig> snps, evenly spread throughout cds, resulting in ten amino acid changes . snp  <dig>  differentiates lgv plasmids from the trachoma plasmids and snp  <dig>  is unique to the blinding trachoma isolates . the protein encoded by cds <dig>  has been located to the cell surface and it has recently been suggested that the cds <dig> product can be secreted from inside the inclusion, to the cytoplasm of chlamydia-infected cells  <cit> . thus the higher number of non-synonymous changes in this cds could result from immune selection giving rise to more variation.

the area of the plasmid from the stop codon of cds <dig> to the start codon of cds <dig> has the highest density of intergenic snps, as well as apparent deletions, making the region the most susceptible to mutation within the c. trachomatis plasmids. thus the area around the replication origin is the most variable and is a poor region in which to design diagnostic pcr primers.

analysis of plasmid copy number
the sequencing of psw <dig> revealed that this plasmid carries one  <dig> bp repeat fewer than the others at the putative origin of replication. to test whether this affects plasmid copy number, dna from several strains was subjected to quantitative pcr. the results showed that, where loss of the repeat sequence had occurred, plasmid copy number was not adversely affected, with plasmid/genome  ratios in the range of 2– <dig> . interestingly, it appears that genital strains have a slightly lower plasmid copy number than the others, and strain jali <dig> has the highest p/g ratio.

CONCLUSIONS
the chromosomes and plasmids of c. trachomatis exhibit extreme levels of sequence conservation and co-inheritance. this may be accounted for by the constraints demanded by the obligate intracellular developmental cycle, and the lack of a route for foreign dna exchange. attempts to cure c. trachomatis of its plasmid using chemical agents have been unsuccessful  <cit> , and viable plasmid-free isolates of c. trachomatis  are exceedingly rare, with only three such isolates reported. the plasmid is therefore not essential for chlamydial viability, but a recent study comparing the pathobiological properties of a naturally occurring plasmid-free l <dig> isolate with a plasmid-bearing strain suggested that the plasmid may have a role in virulence  <cit> . furthermore, studies with plasmid cured c. muridarum showed that this strain failed to cause disease within the infected mouse oviduct  <cit> .

a more detailed examination of the plasmids and genomes of c. trachomatis was prompted by the appearance and spread of a new variant strain in sweden, carrying significant changes to its plasmid. previous phylogenetic analyses of chlamydial plasmids indicated that their evolutionary lineage includes plasmids from other chlamydial species  <cit> . complete genome snp analysis of the c. trachomatis genomes and plasmids presented here indicates that the plasmids from the lymphogranuloma biovars diverged from the trachoma biovars first and this has been followed by subsequent evolution of these plasmids following biological pathways of ocular or genital strains. the current data set therefore provides no evidence that there has been any exchange of plasmids between ocular, genital tract and lgv serovar groupings. there is no accurate molecular clock to measure the evolutionary rate within c. trachomatis, but as these are exclusively human pathogens it would seem likely that these events have occurred within recent human evolution. the discovery of the new variant c. trachomatis, undocumented before  <dig>  strongly suggests either that the novel mutations within the plasmid are very recent  <cit> , or that this variant has become prominent due to the reliance on a plasmid-based diagnostic test.

the cryptic plasmid is an important target for chlamydial detection and knowledge of its structure and variation is essential in designing accurate and sensitive new assays. the data presented here indicate that the cds <dig> region of the plasmid is the most highly conserved part of the sequence and thus the optimal choice for developing new nucleic acid amplification tests. each plasmid analysed has a unique sequence, reflecting its associated serotype; however the differences between some are very slight and it is unlikely that a useful typing system could be developed based on the plasmid alone. undoubtedly, the changes in the new variant c. trachomatis plasmid give it a distinctive signature which will allow its spread in new populations to be followed. even with these large differences between the new variant plasmid psw <dig> and its putative progenitor psw <dig>  it is clear that the chlamydial plasmid remains closely associated with its cognate chromosomal partner. the parallel evolution of the chlamydial plasmid and chromosome, and lack of horizontal gene transfer, is consistent with the intracellular developmental cycle of this species.
