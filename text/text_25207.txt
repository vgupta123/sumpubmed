BACKGROUND
flowering time plays key roles in plant development, plant adaptation to growing regions  <cit> , crop yield  <cit>  and disease resistance  <cit> . abiotic stress such as drought, high salinity and heat, is another major limiting factor for crop yield  <cit> . genetic and molecular analyses has revealed that several distinct but linked signaling pathways regulate the flowering-time in response to light and temperature signals or to internal signals such as vernalization, autonomous pathways and gibberellin signal pathway  <cit> . interaction of different signal transduction pathways before their convergence may allow a coordinated regulation of the activity of the respective pathways. the signals from these pathways are integrated through up-regulating the expression of one or more common target genes: ft, soc <dig> and lfy to determine when flowering. the expressions of soc <dig> and ft are negatively regulated by flc but positively regulated by co <cit> . flc, a mads-box transcription factor, is a negative regulator of floral initiation and an integrator of the autonomous and vernalization pathways. co, encoding a b-box zinc-finger transcription factor, integrate circadian clock and light signals and up-regulate the expression of ft and soc <dig> directly in the long-day pathway  <cit> . constans and gamyb  regulate the expression of lfy by binding with different cis-acting elements in the promoter of lfy respectively  <cit> . skip is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes. all the skip homologs identified so far contained a skip domain with an s-n-w-k-n peptide signature and may have conserved basic functions, such as acting as a cofactor in transcription and splicing  <cit> . however, the derived or additional functions of the skip homologs varied among species. skip was an essential protein for pre-mrna splicing in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, skip was involved in ecdysone-stimulated transcription  <cit>  and known to be a coactivator in notch  <cit> . in caenorhabditis elegans, skip was an essential component of many rna polymerase ii transcription complexes and indispensable for c. elegans development  <cit> . in hordeum vulgare l., skip could interact with gamyb <cit> . in oryza sativa l., osskipa could positively modulate cell viability and stress tolerance  <cit> . atskip functions as not only a positive regulator and putative potential transcription factor in the abiotic stress signaling pathway in arabidopsis  <cit> , but also a component of the spliceosome linking alternative splicing and the circadian clock in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, there has been no report on the identification of skip homologs in soybean and on their functions in the regulation of flowering time in any species so far.

in this study, the expression patterns of soybean gamyb binding protein encoding a homolog of skip protein were analyzed under several abiotic stresses and light conditions. yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to identify the interactions between gmgbp <dig> and gmgamyb <dig>  the phenotypes of transgenic arabidopsis lines in different stress and day-length were analyzed to study the function of gmgbp <dig> 

RESULTS
gmgbp <dig> encodes a homolog of the human skip transcriptional coregulator
the skip homolog gene in soybean was obtained from subtracting long-day from short-day treated mrna. the predicted gene, named as gmgbp <dig> , wasamplified from the cdna of dongnong  <dig> using pcr. the full length cdna of gmgbp <dig>  containing  <dig> bp with an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp, was predicted to encode  <dig> amino acids. gmgbp <dig> protein had a predicted isoelectric point  of  <dig>  and a molecular weight  of  <dig>  kda.

sequence alignment indicated that skip proteins were highly conserved in eukaryotes. the skip protein domain of gmgbp <dig> was located between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  with an s-n-w-k-n peptide signature . a blast search was performed against the assembled soybean genome databases  to analyze the skip sequences in viridiplantae. the phylogenetic tree based on the skip sequences agreed well with the evolutionary relation among these species those were divided into four groups .

a yeast transformation was used to detect the transcriptional activity of gmgbp <dig>  gmgbp <dig>  gmgbp1a, gmgbp1b and gmgbp1c were fused to the gal <dig> dna-binding domain and transformed into yeast strain yrg- <dig> cells respectively. the proteins of gmgbp <dig> and gmgbp1c were both capable of inducing lacz expression in yeast cells and could grow in the medium lacking his, indicating that gmgbp <dig> protein had transcriptional activity in its c-terminal domain .

gmgbp <dig> expression in soybean
a quantitative rt-pcr was performed to analyze the expression of gmgbp <dig> in soybean. gmgbp <dig> could express in all tissues or organs investigated in both lds and sds, although the expression levels were different. the expression levels in stem and immature seed were much higher than those in root, trifoliate leaf, flower bud, pod and leaf. the trifoliate leaf had the lowest expression level in lds, but the highest expression level in sds in the seven samples detected. all the organs, except of stem, showed higher expression in sds than in lds . the expression of skip homologs in rice and arabidopsis have been confirmed to be affected by stresses and phytohormones . therefore, the expression level of gmgbp <dig> in soybean was also analyzed with stresses and phytohormones treatments in the present study. the results indicated that the transcriptional level of gmgbp <dig> was increased after treated with  <dig> μmol aba ,  <dig> μmol ga ,  <dig> mm nacl , 8% peg <dig>  and temperature 42°c respectively .

gmgbp <dig> interacts with gmgamyb <dig> in yeast cells
in barley, it was confirmed that hvgamyb could interact with a skip domain by yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> . therefore, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to study the interaction between gmgbp <dig> and gmgamyb <dig>  gmgamyb <dig> contained a typical r2/r3-myb dna-binding domain and three conserved regions . gmgamyb <dig> was more homologous to atmyb <dig> rather than atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> . as gmgbp <dig> showed transcriptional activity in the c-terminal domain, the pbd-gmgbp1a and pbd-gmgbp1b were chosen for the bait vectors to search the protein interaction with gmgamyb <dig>  moreover, the prey was divided into two parts  by the domain area of r2r <dig>  as pad-gmgamyb <dig>  pad-gmgamyb1a and pad-gmgamyb1b. the co-transformation with pbd-gmgbp1a and the prey plasmid could not grow on sd/-tlh, indicating that the section of gmgbp <dig> had no ability to interact with gmgamyb <dig> . furthermore, the yeast cells with pbd-gmgbp1b and pad-gmgamyb1b showed no ability to interact with gmgamyb <dig> . in contrast, the section b of gmgbp <dig> interacted with gmgamyb <dig> by binding to the domain of gmgamyb <dig> as the result of the growth on sd/-tlh, exhibiting the positive color reaction . 

the homozygous mutant atskip of arabidopsis was lethal at late stage
an insertion of a t14n <dig> fragment at the  <dig> bp of exon of atskip caused mutant . the mutant atskip had the same germination rate with the wt plant , and all of the plants could grow normally in the ms medium. however, 100% of the homologous plants died within  <dig> weeks after transplanting in soil before flowering whereas all wt and heterozygous plants grew normal under the same conditions . the homozygosity of mutant was detected by pcr and rt-pcr after transplanting in soil.

considering the homozygous mutant of atskip was lethal, rnai was used to produce the atskip-i plant to suppress the expression of this gene. although the expression of atskip was only partially suppressed , the plants showed abnormal phenotypes such as late flowering, small rosette leaves. according to rt-pcr analyses, the expressions of several key flowering-related genes were down-regulated . the promotion and inhibitory factors of flowering were both down-regulated, which suggested that skip might be involved in more than two different flowering pathways.

ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> alters stress tolerance in arabidopsis
since gmgbp <dig> was up-regulated by stresses and stress-related phytohormones, arabidopsis thaliana plants, containing extra copies of gmgbp <dig> gene, was produced to investigate whether overexpression of this gene could enhance stress tolerance. the transgenic lines were confirmed by pcr and rt-pcr with homolog-specific primers . in the ms medium containing aba , the germination rates of gmgbp1-ox and atskip-i plants were both reduced compared to wt , indicating that ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> could increase the growth-suppression effect of aba and atskip might have the ability of reducing the negative effect of aba. in the ms medium containing nacl , the germination rates of gmgbp1-ox and atskip-i plants were also lower than the wt plants , suggesting that gmgbp <dig> decreased salt tolerance and atskip improved the ability to salt tolerance. however, the germination rates of the three plants under  <dig> mm mannitol showed no difference . a further study was performed to detect the stress tolerance of gmgbp <dig>  when  <dig> days old plants growing in soil under sds were treated with drought condition , nearly all of the gmgbp1-ox plants were recovered at  <dig> days after re-watering, whereas only 40-60% of wt plants and none of atskip-i plants were recovered . the root lengths of both gmgbp1-ox and atskip-i plants were shorter than that of wt plants in the ms medium treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> days ; the gmgbp1-ox and atskip-i plants treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> days under lds were nearly dead, while 80-90% of wt plants survived .

heat tolerance experiment revealed that gmgbp <dig> might improve heat tolerance of arabidopsis plants with ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig>  7days old plants of transgenic arabidopsis, treated with 37°c for  <dig> days, exhibited symptom of flagged leaves, but wt and atskip-i plants showed more serious symptom with whitened leaves . furthermore, wt and atskip-i plants of 15days old showed more whitened leaves, even dead after treated with 37°c for  <dig> days, whereas gmgbp1-ox plants showed more vital .

the gmgbp1-ox plants had a higher superoxide dismutase  level than both atskip-i and wt plants under heat or drought conditions. the malondialdehyde  level of gmgbp1-ox plants was much lower than both atskip-i and wt plants, indicating that the ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> in arabidopsis might enhance the heat and drought tolerance. however, the highest mda level and the lowest sod level of gmgbp1-ox plants implied the reduced salt tolerance in gmgbp1-transgenic arabidopsis .

stress resistance-related genes are affected by gmgbp1
to gain further insight into the mechanism of the altered stress resistance of gmgbp1-ox plants, transcript levels of  <dig> stress-responsive genes  <cit>  were assayed in the gmgbp1-ox, atskip-i and wt plants under normal and stress conditions. the expression levels of all the  <dig> genes in gmgbp1-ox were higher than wt and atskip-i plants . moreover, zat <dig>  zat <dig>  hsfa1b and hsfa <dig> showed significantly higher expression level in gmgbp1-ox than in wt and atskip-i plants after treated with 42c for 2h , myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myc <dig>  rd <dig> and zat <dig> were up-regulated after drought for 7days . these results suggested that overexpression of gmgbp <dig> can increase the transcript levels of some stress-resistance genes under drought or heat stress conditions, thus improving the drought or heat resistance of the transgenic plants. however, the expression levels of rd <dig>  zat <dig> and zat <dig> in gmgbp1-ox plants were significantly lower than wt and atskip-i plants after treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> days , indicating that gmgbp <dig> might reduce the resistance to high salinity. 

early flowering of gmgbp1-ox plants in long-day condition
the response to day-length implied the possibility of flowering-related functions of gmgbp <dig>  in lds condition , the t <dig> plants of gmgbp1-ox arabidopsis flowered  <dig> days earlier and had fewer rosette leaves than wt plants, and the atskip-i plants flowered significantly late . furthermore, the expressions of constans  and flowering locus t  in gmgbp1-ox plants were increased compared to wt and atskip-i plants, and atskip-i plants had the lowest expression levels of co and ft , indicating that gmgbp <dig> could control the flowering time by up-regulating flowering-related gene co and ft in lds.

however, in the short-day  condition, the t <dig> plants of gmgbp1-ox arabidopsis flowered latest and had the most rosette leaves . in contrast, atskip-i plants showed the earliest flowering and had the fewest rosette leaves. this result suggested that there might be some other ways to regulate flowering in sds. the key flowering inhibitor gene, flc, was significantly up-regulated in gmgbp1-ox plants . all the results suggested autonomous pathway could account for the late flowering phenotype.

gamyb genetically acts downstream of gbp to regulate flowering time
previous reports showed that atmyb <dig> influenced flowering by mediating ga responsiveness of the lfy promoter  <cit> , and was down-regulated in atskip-i plant in this study . myb <dig> mutant plants  and myb <dig> mutant plants containing extra copies of gmgbp <dig> gene were introduced to investigate the impact of the interaction between gmgbp <dig> and gmgamyb <dig> on flowering. in lds, no effect on flowering time and leaf numbers was observed in gmgbp1-ox/myb <dig> plants , and the expression level of lfy in gmgbp1-ox/myb <dig> plants was same to the level of wt, but gmgbp1-ox plants had a high level of lfy . gmgbp <dig> was directly located on the upstream of gamyb, and regulate flowering in lds.

since gmgbp <dig> regulated flowering in autonomous pathway in sds, a further study was performed to investigate the responsibility of myb <dig> in the late flowering phenotype. the result revealed that gmgbp1-ox/myb <dig> plants also showed late flowering like gmgbp1-ox plants , suggesting that gmgbp <dig> was independent of myb <dig> in delaying flowering time in sds.

discussion
essential roles of skip for plant growth and stress tolerance
skip protein, as a spliceosome component, played a vital role in maintaining cell viability in yeast , c. elegans  and o. sativa   <cit> . the homozygous mutant of atskip in arabidopsis resulted in death of plants, which was similar to the phenotype of severe growth arrest and even death of o. sativa with suppression of osskipa and embryonic arrest of the ceskip mutant in c. elegans, which indicated that atskip was also required for maintaining cell viability and normal growth in arabidopsis. the indispensable role of skip homolog in keeping normal cell viability and growth might be conserved in plants, which was supported by that the plant skip homologs possessed the conserved skip domain for cell viability identified in prp <dig>  however, it needs further study to confirm whether the skip homologs in soybean could have the conserved function for cell viability.

drought and high-salinity repressed plant growth and limited seed yield. skip homologs in arabidopsis and rice could improve the tolerance to drought and high-salinity  <cit> . in this study, the ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> in arabidopsis could enhance the tolerance to drought. however, gmgbp1-ox plants showed a salt-sensitive appearance, although atskip-i plants reduced the tolerance to salt as previous report  <cit> . thus, the tolerance of skip homologs to salt might be not conserved in plant. heat, one of serious environmental stresses, affected the growth of plants and the productivity of crops. there was no report about heat tolerance of skip homologs previously. our result showed that gmgbp1-ox plants increased the tolerance to heat whereas atskip-i plants reduced the tolerance to heat, indicating that atskip has the ability of heat tolerance.

reactive oxygen species  could be induced by abiotic stresses, and over-accumulation of ros could lead to cell damage and even death. sod was used to eliminate ros, and mda was the intermediate product during the elimination of ros  <cit> . in this study, the raised content of ros in gmgbp1-ox plants treated with salinity and the decreased content of ros in gmgbp1-ox plants treated with heat  indicated that the altered stress tolerance of gmgbp1-ox plants may be partially due to the regulation of the activity of ros-eliminating.

gmgbp <dig> regulates flowering time
interestingly, in this study ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> in arabidopsis induced earlier flowering in lds and late flowering in sds. the finding of a flowering-regulation function from a skip homolog has not yet been reported in any plants so far. the specific function of gmgbp <dig> in regulating flowering time might be especially useful for developing soybean cultivars with the adaptability to broad grow regions.

flowering time was controlled by several signaling pathways, such as the day-length, vernalization, autonomous pathways and gibberellin signal pathway  <cit> , and it could be measured by scoring the number of rosette leaves at flowering time and the number of days from germination to bolting in arabidopsis  <cit> . the number of rosette leaves at flowering time and the number of days from germination to bolting measured in gmgbp1-ox plants were both reduced in lds, suggesting that ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> induced early flowering. atskip-i plants delayed flowering in lds supported the early flowering of gmgbp1-ox plants in another hand. however, when gmgbp <dig> ectopicly expressed in myb <dig> plants, no early flowering could be observed in lds, indicating that the early flowering function of gmgbp <dig> might depend on the existence of myb <dig>  when the transgenic lines were transferred into sds, the phenotypes of flowering were all changed. the flowering times of gmgbp1-ox and gmgbp1-ox/myb <dig> plants were both delayed significantly, and atskip-i displayed the early flowering phenotype in sds.

the expression levels of numerous flowering-related genes could be induced by day-length or gibberellin. the expression level of gmgbp <dig> was regulated by both day-length and gibberellin, suggesting that gmgbp <dig> might participate in both day-length and gibberellin signal pathways. in atskipi plants of arabidopsis, the expression levels of more than  <dig> flowering-related genes were affected. in particular, the mrna levels of several flowering integrators  were significantly lower. our results showed that ft and lfy were both up-regulated in gmgbp1-ox plants in lds, but lfy showed no change when gmgbp <dig> was ectopic expression in myb <dig> mutants. considering the interaction between gmgbp <dig> and gmgamyb <dig>  and the conserved function on photoperiodic flowering of ft homologs in soybean  <cit> , gmgbp <dig> might regulate flowering time in two ways by its function as a transcription factor and interaction in lds. on one hand, gmgbp <dig> could regulate the expressions of flowering-related genes in day-length signal pathway, and on the other hand, gmgbp <dig> could bind with gmgamyb <dig> in gibberellin signal pathway to control flowering time.

many reports had revealed that ga pathway played a key role in flowering under sd condition when other regulatory pathways that promoted flowering were not active  <cit> . however, the late flowering of gmgbp1-ox plants indicated that there might be another way to control flowering in sds. flc was a negative regulator of floral initiation and an integrator of the autonomous and vernalization pathways. flc could directly down-regulated ft and soc <dig> to repress the flowering in these pathways  <cit> . svp, a mads box transcription factor, could interact with flc and acted as partially redundant repressors of flowering time with flc <cit> . the negative action on the phenotypes of the down-regulated flc and svp in atskip-i plants in lds suggested that flowering time was regulated crossly by several signal pathways and skip might take part in more than two ways. in sds, the expression of flc was up-regulated in gmgbp1-ox plants, and was down-regulated in atskip-i plants as that in lds. the late flowering of gmgbp1-ox plants in sds elucidated that gmgbp <dig> might delay flowering time in sds through autonomous pathway by improving the expression level of flc, a key flowering inhibitor factor.

in general, gmgbp <dig> might regulate flowering time by three signal pathways. gmgbp <dig> positively controlled the flowering time by regulating co, ft, lfy and gamyb directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in lds, gmgbp <dig> repressed flowering by regulating flc and svp in autonomous pathway in sds.

diverse functions of skip homologs in plant
skip had a conserved skip domain with an s-n-w-k-n peptide signature, and was considered as a cofactor for transcription regulation in all eukaryotes so far. however, the derived or additional functions of the skip homologs varied among species. transgenic rice that overexpressed osskipa exhibited stress tolerances  at both seedling and reproductive stages  <cit> . overexpression of the atskip gene in arabidopsis modulated the induction of salt tolerance, dehydration resistance and insensitivity towards abscisic acid under stress conditions  <cit> ; however, ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> in arabidopsis reduced tolerance to nacl, but increased tolerance to drought and heat in this study.

suppression of osskip resulted in growth arrest of rice due to the reduced cell viability in the active growth regions  <cit> . a decrease in atskip expression led to altered plant development with the phenotype of reduced inflorescence stems and smaller rosette leaves  <cit> . in this study, the homozygous atskip mutant was lethal to the growth, and the knockdown of atskip showed late flowering and increased number of rosette leaves. the ectopic expression of gmgbp <dig> induced premature flowering of arabidopsis in lds. all the study on skip homologs in plant revealed that skips might play a vital role in the growth and development of plant, but have different function on the stress tolerance and flowering in plant.

plant skips were divided into four groups based on the skip sequences by phylogenetic tree . the different groups among osskip, atskip and gmgbp <dig> indicated the diversity of their functions. skip could be induced by various abiotic stresses, phytohormones treatments and day-length, but the expression patterns of skip varied among rice, arabidopsis and soybean  <cit> . the transcriptional levels of osskip, atskip and gmgbp <dig> were all up-regulated by aba, nacl and drought , but had different scales. gmgbp <dig> could be induced by day-length and heat, but no related report for osskip and atskip in rice and arabidopsis. the various functions of skip homologs might be also owing to the diversification of skip-interacting proteins sips. previous studies showed that the skip homologs, prp <dig> , bx <dig> , ceskip , hvskip  and osskip  had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> interacted proteins, respectively  <cit> . nevertheless, few sips could match each other among species. for example, both hvskip and gmgbp <dig> interacted with gamyb but osgamyb was not included in the  <dig> ossips  <cit> . all the data indicated that skip might participate in distinct functions through the interaction with diverse proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, gmgbp <dig> as a homolog of skip in soybean, not only regulates plant flowering time but also alters plant resistance to abiotic stress in arabidopsis. such a flowering study about skip homolog in plant has no report so far. although both osskip and atskip could improve plant tolerance to high salinity and drought  <cit> , gmgbp <dig> might improve plant tolerance to heat and drought, but reduce the resistance to high salinity. the flowering and stress related functions of gmgbp <dig> might be used to develop soybean cultivars with the adaptability to broad grow regions and environment.
