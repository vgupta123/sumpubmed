BACKGROUND
hiv- <dig> infection is a global health problem and the fourth leading cause of death worldwide  <cit> . one approach to effective hiv prevention or treatment is to understand the interplay of host molecular mechanisms that are primarily influenced by genetic variation. multiple genes have been implicated as important genetic determinants of the clinical course of hiv- <dig> infection by regulating various biological pathways including adaptive and innate immune responses  <cit> . however, associations with most of these genes appear to be population-specific, and many exhibit marked allele frequency differences between different racial/ethnic groups  <cit> .

this interpopulation genomic variability and these differential associations are still poorly understood, and could plausibly be due to natural selection resulting from distinct environmental or cultural pressures in different geographical populations  <cit> . for instance, the most promising host genetic variant with biological and functional significance in the control of hiv- <dig> infection is a 32-bp deletion  in the ccr <dig> gene, which codes for the β-chemokine receptor that the virus uses to enter the host cells  <cit> . the homozygous deletion of a 32-bp segment results in a nonfunctional receptor  <cit> , rendering individuals largely, but not completely, resistant to hiv- <dig> infection. the frequency of homozygous deletion is <  <dig> % among european-descent populations, in which it has been postulated to have arisen in response to immune challenges  <cit> , is rare in african americans, and completely absent in african and east asian populations. studies have also shown evidence of positive selection at other genes involved in hiv- <dig> pathogenesis, such as trim5α and apobec3g  <cit> , while others do not find any such evidence  <cit> .

recent genome-wide association studies  in both european americans  and african americans  have identified a region within the human leukocyte antigen  superlocus that is consistently associated with hiv- <dig> viral load  set-point, and which seems to be the main predictor for disease progression  <cit> . the two single nucleotide polymorphisms  with the strongest associations among ea, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  are located within  <dig> kilobases  of each other in the hla class i region of chromosome  <dig>  near the hcp <dig>  hla-b, and hla-c genes. among aa, this is also the most strongly implicated region of the hla  <cit> . among both aa and ea, several non-hla loci were also found to be among the 'top hits'  in gwas. in fact, the strongest associations in the gwas among aa were located outside the hla region. thus, if hla variants implicated in hiv- <dig> vl control show population differences and evidence of natural selection, one may expect to observe similar patterns at the non-hla variants that have been implicated in hiv- <dig> vl control.

while the hiv- <dig> virus is known to adapt itself in humans with staggering mutation rates, especially in response to therapy, factors such as the very short time since the emergence of the recent hiv- <dig> epidemic make it unlikely that selection in humans in response to this specific epidemic has exerted a large, detectable effect  <cit> . it is however possible that these loci were subject to natural selection in the more distant past in response to other pathogens, and this has contributed to the population differences we currently observe in hiv- <dig> vl control. we therefore hypothesize that the genomic regions most strongly associated with hiv- <dig> vl control in gwas have been subject to natural selection and differentiation in some populations. in order to test this hypothesis, we examined patterns of fst and relative extended haplotype homozygosity  in the genomic regions surrounding both the hla and non-hla hiv- <dig> control-associated loci identified through gwas in ea and aa. we find evidence of natural selection among eurasian groups at these loci.

RESULTS
fst analysis
we first analyzed fst at the loci with the strongest evidence of association among ea . the region surrounding these two loci, which are in low ld  in a ea population  <cit> , exhibits very low fst compared to random regions of chromosome  <dig> for all of the pairwise comparisons with sub-saharan africans , suggesting that much less differentiation than expected has occurred between afr and other groups . however, the pairwise comparisons with europeans  show that the extent of differentiation between eur and middle easterners  is substantially elevated, as it is between south asians  and eur, compared to the comparisons with afr. our bootstrap analysis shows that the fst of afr-eur is significantly lower  than the fst of mid-eur, sas-eur, and ame-eur, after considering the chromosomal background differences.

we next examined whether this pattern of population differentiation applies to the wider region of the hla that contains four additional independently associated loci among ea, and the top five 'hits' in the hla among aa . for most of this region we observe a similar pattern of very little differentiation between afr and other groups and greater differentiation among eur, mid, and sas, as well as oceanians . next, we examined the entire hla region, and find that this pattern of very little differentiation between afr and other groups applies specifically to the region containing the loci associated with hiv- <dig> vl control, and is therefore not generalizable to the entire hla. as shown in figure  <dig>  this pattern applies approximately to the  <dig> mb to  <dig> mb region of chromosome  <dig>  which is the region containing variants associated with hiv- <dig> vl control

in order to investigate the finer-grained patterns of differentiation among all  <dig> populations, we focused on the  <dig> kb genomic window surrounding rs <dig>  as shown in the above analyses, this region exhibits very little differentiation between afr groups and other groups. however, within afr, the degree of differentiation appears to be quite elevated among the bantu, mandenka, and yoruba. we observe the greatest degree of differentiation among the makrani, sindhi , and the druze  populations .

fst results for the mean of the top  <dig> non-hla 'hits' for each of the ea and aa gwas  are shown in figure  <dig>  we find a pattern of differentiation for the aa loci similar to that found for the hla loci in that the group-specific fst  appears to be lower compared to that of other groups. however, this difference is not statistically significant since the 95% ci for the afr gsfst overlaps with that of other groups. results for individual loci are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  among the aa 'top hits', the region surrounding rs <dig>  a snp in an intergenic region on chromosome  <dig>  is much less differentiated between afr and other groups compared to the differentiation among non-afr. we observe a similar pattern at rs <dig> near the st8sia <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  and at rs <dig> in the znf <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  in all of our analyses, we obtained very similar results using cm as opposed to kb.

rehh
depending on population group, among the  <dig>  -  <dig>  total haplotype cores across chromosome  <dig>  we examined between  <dig> and  <dig> haplotype cores in the region delimited by  <dig> kb upstream of rs <dig> and  <dig> kb downstream of rs <dig>  the number of >99th percentile rehh values within this region are shown in table  <dig>  we find an excess of extreme rehh values among sas, mid, and east asians  compared to afr and native americans . this excess is statistically significant  for all pairwise comparisons with afr and ame, except for eur and oce. q-q plots  also show the excess of lower-than-expected p-values among sas, eas, and mid, compared to the other groups. we also examined rehh values for haplotypes extending to  <dig> kb, and found a similar pattern. we find a similar pattern when using only part of chromosome  <dig> containing the hla, instead of the entire chromosome, as the empirical distribution. the lowest panel in figure  <dig> shows the location of haplotypes with rehh p-values less than  <dig>  for each group, except afr and ame, for which there are no qualifying haplotypes. many of these haplotypes are located around rs <dig>  thus providing confirmatory evidence  for recent selection at these loci in the mid, eur and sas and eas groups. we observe an upward trend in fst for the pairwise comparison at the same location where we observe evidence of extreme rehh for a given group. this is especially apparent for mid, sas, eas, and eur. rehh results for the non-hla 'top hits' are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  we find no evidence of major differences among groups in the number of loci exhibiting high rehh values.

shown in parentheses are the number of haplotypes with p-value less than  <dig>  . also shown is the rehh when using the hla region as the empirical distribution as opposed to the entire chromosome. 

listed is the number of haplotypes with rehh empirical p-value less than  <dig>  and core haplotype frequency greater than 5%. 

listed is the number of haplotypes with rehh empirical p-value less than  <dig>  and core haplotype frequency greater than 5%. 

finally, we sought to determine whether the susceptibility or the protective allele for rs <dig> and rs <dig> is contained in the core of the haplotypes  that are outliers in the rehh distribution . we find no qualifying haplotypes containing either of these snps among afr and mid. among sas, we find that the susceptibility allele  for rs <dig> is the allele which is in the core of a haplotype with high rehh . this haplotype contains approximately 23% of the susceptibility alleles at this locus present among sas. among eur, the protective allele  is in the core of a haplotype with high rehh . this haplotype contains all protective alleles at this locus present among eur. among eas, the susceptibility allele of rs <dig> is on a high-rehh haplotype . this haplotype contains approximately 10% of the susceptibility alleles at this locus present among eas. the protective allele  of rs <dig> is on a high rehh haplotype . this haplotype contains approximately 21% of the protective alleles at this locus present among eas. among oce, the susceptibility allele of rs <dig> is on a high-rehh haplotype . since the susceptibility allele is fixed among oce, these haplotypes contain approximately 30% and 14% respectively, of the susceptibility alleles at this locus among oce. we find no qualifying haplotypes among ame.

discussion
we hypothesized that the genetic variants found to be associated with hiv- <dig> vl control were subject to recent natural selection and population differentiation. this natural selection could have resulted in the observed population differences in hiv- <dig> pathogenicity among contemporary populations. we examined the most significant hla and non-hla variants associated with hiv- <dig> vl in gwas among ea and aa, and found that the top associated loci in the hla region are located in a sub-region of the hla that shows very little relative differentiation between the considered sub-saharan african group and other groups, compared to the relative levels of differentiation among the eurasian groups considered. we also confirm that the patterns observed in this sub-region are not generalizable across all hla sub-regions.

considering all  <dig> populations, we find the greatest degree of differentiation at the rs <dig> locus for many pairwise comparisons with the makrani and sindhi in pakistan, as well as the bantu in africa, and the druze in israel. further studies are needed to confirm and gain a better understanding of the possible reasons for this pattern. although we take into account a total of  <dig> snps in this locus, these results should be interpreted with some caution given the small sample sizes for some populations.

we find that the differentiation pattern observed in the hla sub-region also applies to the non-hla 'top hits', but only among those identified in the hiv- <dig> vl gwas among aa. averaging gsfst over the top ten regions shows a general trend of a smaller degree of differentiation between the sub-saharan african group and other groups. the lack of differentiation that we observe between the sub-saharan african and other groups at the hla sub-region could be due to a high degree of conservation. it is plausible that as each population in eurasia was subjected to unique selection pressures, a greater degree of differentiation occurred among eurasian groups than between each of these groups and sub-saharan africans. these results should be interpreted with caution because some of the 'top hits' that we examine do not reach genome-wide statistical significance in the respective gwas.

paralleling the pattern in differentiation, we observed evidence of extreme relative extended haplotype homozygosity  among eurasian groups but not among sub-saharan africans or native americans. on the basis of our finding of multiple haplotypes with extreme rehh and at relatively low frequencies , our results appear to be more consistent with a mode of recent evolution characterized by multiple soft sweeps as opposed to single hard sweeps  <cit> .they also suggest that the patterns of differentiation and rehh are not uniform and homogenous across all eurasians. instead, it is possible that population-specific patterns of genetic change, perhaps in response to region-specific selection pressures, resulted in unique localized adaptations in different eurasian populations. our rehh results suggest that the evidence for selection in the hla among eurasian groups is one in which several different haplotypes of low to moderate frequency have spread through populations. in this context, it should be noted that rehh may not be powerful enough to detect very low frequency haplotypes  <cit> . other tests of selection such as xp-ehh  do not appear to show similar trends as those we obtained using fst and rehh. this may be due to the fact that xp-ehh is most powerful for cases of selection in which the selected haplotype reaches a very high frequency in one population but not another, which does not appear to be the situation for the loci that we have examined.

among europeans in the hgdp, all rs <dig> protective alleles  are on a haplotype that has high rehh, suggesting that this allele or one linked to it may have quickly arisen in response to a selective pressure such as an infectious disease in europe. however, among south asians, east asians and oceanians, it is the susceptibility allele at this snp that is the allele present on the haplotype that has high rehh. the inconsistency of these results could signify, among several things, that there are many different polymorphisms in this region that could have functional significance, that the genetic basis of adaptation to similar pressures could be different among different groups, and finally, that the genetic basis of hiv- <dig> control could be different among different racial/ethnic groups.

our findings are consistent with recent findings that signatures of selection among europeans are enriched for immunity related genes in the hla  <cit> . in fact, kudaravalli et al.  <cit>  recently found that snps associated with gene expression levels of hla-c also show evidence of selection in both europeans and east asians in the hapmap samples. along with these and other studies , our findings suggest the presence of selection pressures on the immune system, possibly due to geographic, demographic, cultural, or environmental factors related to subsistence. for example, our fine-scaled analysis of all  <dig> hgdp populations shows that among the sub-saharan populations, those populations that show elevated fst between each other  are also the groups that have a history of practicing agriculture. it should be noted that we have not examined populations from east africa, as these may show very unique patterns, especially considering that the frequency of the rs <dig> protective allele among the maasai in the hapmap <dig> sample is quite elevated , and that henn et al. have found that this allele is also at a relatively high frequency among the sandawe  in east africa, and that it exhibits evidence of recent selection in this group  <cit> .

while we have found evidence suggesting the action of natural selection on the genomic regions associated with hiv- <dig> vl among eurasian populations, one has to be cautious in interpreting our results. although in all of our analyses, we have controlled for the genomic background by comparing fst and rehh at the locus of interest to a distribution of other loci on the respective chromosome, we have not necessarily directly tested whether the patterns we observe are consistent with natural selection as opposed to more stochastic evolutionary forces such as genetic drift. although it is difficult to distinguish selection from drift with certainty, the greater extended haplotype homozygosity among eurasians coinciding with elevated differentiation among these groups makes the situation we have outlined  more compelling.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results show that the hla region, as well as some of the non-hla regions, that contain loci associated with hiv- <dig> vl control among persons of both european and african ancestry, appear to have been subject to natural selection, resulting in population differentiation among eurasian groups, but not among other groups. future studies on different samples and/or with different methods will be needed to confirm our findings, and should examine more fine-scale patterns both at the geographic and genetic level. understanding the genome-wide selection pressure on hiv-1-interacting proteins can provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics of host factors, the genetic basis of differences between nonpathogenic and pathogenic lentivirus infection, and the roles of individual genes in host-pathogen interaction and immunopathogenesis.
