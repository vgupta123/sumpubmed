BACKGROUND
the brown planthopper  is a typical phloem-feeding insect and a major pest of rice . at this time,  <dig> bph-resistance genes have been identified in rice,  <dig> of which are located on chromosomes  <cit> . resistance genes bph <dig> and bph <dig> were introgressed from wild rice oryza officinalis
 <cit> . these two genes showed significant resistance to bph and have been broadly employed in rice breeding programs  <cit> . recently, bph <dig> was isolated using a map-based cloning strategy, and it was found to encode a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, and leucine-rich repeat  protein that activates the sa signaling pathway  <cit> . in rice breeding, bph <dig> shows a greater resistance effect than bph <dig> and bph <dig> when introgressed into the elite indica rice  <dig> and hybrid rice  <cit> . bph <dig> is located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  where  <dig> bph-resistance genes are clustered  <cit> .

plant responses to insect attack are correlated to the mode of feeding  <cit> . gene expression profiles suggested that defense mechanisms against bph differ from those against chewing insects. genes involved in macromolecule degradation and plant defenses were found to be upregulated, whereas those involved in photosynthesis and cell growth were downregulated after bph infestation  <cit> . quantitative proteomics results revealed that proteins involved in ja synthesis, oxidative stress response, β-glucanases, and kinases showed significant changes in expression in response to bph feeding  <cit> . nitric oxide was used by plants as a signaling molecule and plays a role in the rice tolerance response to bph feeding  <cit> . callose deposition on the sieve plates occluded the sieve tubes and inhibited continuous feeding by bph in resistant lines; thus, the death of bph on resistant lines was the result of starvation and not poisoning  <cit> . nevertheless, complete transcriptional analysis of the bph response genes remains unavailable, and more comprehensive differential expression profiles are required to better understand the molecular mechanism of bph resistance in rice.

to clone bph <dig> and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism of resistance, we backcrossed the resistant plant carrying the bph <dig> locus to susceptible rice and developed the backcrossed populations. bph <dig> was located in a recombination cold spot of 580-kb. high-throughput rna sequencing represents the latest and most suitable tool for characterizing the transcriptome  <cit> . we then applied deep rna sequencing to investigate the transcriptomes of bph <dig> introgression line and susceptible recipient line. in the sequenced bph <dig> region, four jacalin-related lectin  domain proteins and a lrr family protein were considered candidate bph <dig> genes. the molecular mechanism of resistance to bph was also explored by comparing differentially expressed genes  between resistant and susceptible rice.

RESULTS
bph resistance gene bph15is located in a recombination cold-spot region
we previously mapped the major bph-resistance gene on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> between molecular markers rg <dig> and rg <dig> using the f <dig> population of cross between ri <dig>  a recombinant inbred line that carrying the bph <dig> gene from original resistant donor b <dig>  and susceptible rice tn <dig>   <cit> . to fine-map the gene, the resistant rice line yhy <dig> carrying the bph <dig> locus was selected from the f <dig> population and backcrossed to tn <dig> to develop mapping populations . after genotyping bc1f <dig> and phenotyping the bc1f <dig> populations, bph <dig> was mapped between markers rm <dig> and s <dig> . we further screened  <dig>  bc2f <dig> plants for recombination between rm <dig> and s <dig>  and  <dig> recombination events were identified. the average genome-wide recombination rate  is about  <dig>  cm/kb in rice  <cit> . chromosome intervals between rm <dig> and s <dig> showed a much lower recombination rate . after genotyping the recombinant plants using newly developed markers  and phenotyping the fixed recombinant plants, bph <dig> was mapped to a  <dig>  cm interval defined by g12140- <dig> and t <dig>  . a high recombination rate was observed just outside of the bph <dig> region. specifically, the  <dig> -kb fragment from marker t <dig> to 20m <dig> is a hot spot with a genetic recombination rate of  <dig>  cm/kb, much higher than the whole genome level . afterward, we identified  <dig> recombinants from  <dig>  bc4f <dig> plants, similar to bc2f <dig> plants, and no crossover was found in the bph <dig> region . based on these results, bph <dig> is located in a recombination cold-spot region, and identifying candidate bph <dig> genes using conventional analysis of recombination is difficult.figure  <dig>

high level of sequence diversity in the bph15region
the physical distance between the markers g12140- <dig> and t <dig> is approximately 210-kb in the nipponbare genome. to detect the actual length and identify the genes in the region spanning the bph <dig> locus, we constructed a genomic bac library of long insertion fragments for the resistant rice b <dig>  the original donor of bph <dig>  the markers g12140- <dig> and t <dig> were used to screen bac clones by amplification of the bac dna pools for an initial chromosome walking. using five steps of walking, the physical map of the bph <dig> region was assembled, and the shortest path consisted of seven bac clones . a gap existed between the bac 95c <dig> and bac 43n <dig>  the seven bac clones were sequenced and included a 700-kb region. finally, we mapped the bph <dig> locus between g12140- <dig> and newly developed marker t <dig> , and the physical distance was at least 580-kb according to sequenced bac clones. eighty-seven genes within this 580-kb region were annotated using online fgenesh software  and  <dig> genes were te-related genes . there were  <dig> annotated genes in the 210-kb nipponbare sequence according to msu  <dig>  and  <dig> genes were te-related genes . excluding several functional genes , the sequences in this region of the two rice genotypes are highly diverse. based on these results, the sequence of this region in the resistant rice genome differed significantly from the corresponding region in the reference genome of nipponbare; i.e., the 210-kb fragment in nipponbare was replaced by a much larger fragment containing several repeat sequences in resistant rice. thus, developing codominant molecular markers for this region was difficult. the high level of sequence diversity in the bph <dig> region explained the heavy suppression of recombination in this region.figure  <dig>

bph-responsive transcript profiles are distinct in resistant bph15introgression line and susceptible recipient line
to identify the bph <dig> candidate genes and understand the molecular mechanism of resistance, the expression profiles of bph <dig> introgression line  and susceptible recipient line  were determined using deep rna sequencing. rnas extracted from rice samples at the early stage , late stage  and control  of two rice lines were sequenced. as a result,  <dig> million paired-end sequence reads of 100 bp in length were generated in six samples. after removing low-quality reads, a total of  <dig> million high-quality clean reads remained, of which  <dig> – <dig> % were aligned to the reference genome using tophat .table  <dig>

one fundamental use of transcriptome sequencing is analysis of differentially expressed genes  between samples  <cit> . in our study, we defined degs as the transcripts showing at least a  <dig> -fold change of the fpkm   and p-value <  <dig> . in total,  <dig>  degs were detected among seven comparisons: s0_s <dig>  s0_s <dig>  r0_r <dig>  r0_r <dig>  s0_r <dig>  s6_r <dig>  and s48_r <dig> . in susceptible rice,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were found in s0_s <dig> and s0_s <dig> comparisons, respectively. in contrast, in resistant rice, the degs numbers were  <dig> and  <dig> in r0_r <dig> and r0_r <dig>  respectively .figure  <dig>

degs in susceptible and resistant rice at  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai were hierarchically clustered, and the heat map is shown in figure 4a. the majority of degs had similar expression patterns among four comparisons, showing consistent upregulation or downregulation, although not all p-values for the four comparisons were below  <dig> . to compare the two rice genotypes, degs exclusively at  <dig> hai were selected and hierarchically clustered. most of these degs had lower amplitude of variation in the resistant genotype compared to the susceptible genotype . the k-means clustering analysis results also supported the conclusion .figure  <dig>

high-throughput technologies such as microarray and sequencing methods generate enormous amounts of data, but individual functional annotation of all degs remains challenging. pathway-based analysis to characterize the interaction between genes increases our understanding of the biological function of degs  <cit> . degs assigned to mapman pathways and important classifications are listed in additional file  <dig> and provided in table  <dig>  to verify the rna-seq results, the expression of  <dig> degs was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction  with gene-specific primers . additional file  <dig> provided detailed rna-seq fold-change values for every deg and their qpcr results of three biological replicates. the qpcr results were consistent with rna-seq data, since the genes displayed similar fold-changes with a correlation ratio of r2 =  <dig>  .table  <dig>

hormone signaling pathways play pivotal roles in plant defense  <cit> . in this study, the majority of ethylene synthesis genes and ethylene signal transduction genes, such as aco  and erf , were upregulated in two rice genotypes, but the number of degs in resistant rice was less than that in susceptible rice . this result suggested that bph feeding activated the et signaling pathway in susceptible rice. jasmonate synthesis genes, such as lipoxygenase lox , allene oxidase synthase aos <dig> , and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase opr <dig>  were upregulated in susceptible rice, which suggests that bph attack induces the ja signaling pathway . four sa carboxyl methyltransferase  genes were upregulated in susceptible rice , which can reduce sa content by forming mesa from sa in the plants  <cit> . other sa synthesis and signaling genes were not identified in degs. we measured the sa content in leaf sheath surrounding the stem from plants exposed to bph for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry . no significant difference in sa levels was observed between the bph-infested and control plants or between resistant and susceptible plants, except that sa levels in  <dig> hai susceptible rice were significantly lower than in resistant rice. the lower sa content may be caused by upregulated samt genes expression. these results indicated that the sa signaling pathway may not be activated in bph15-mediated resistance or during the basal defense of susceptible rice.table  <dig> 
representative pathway genes




in total,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins responding to biotic stress were upregulated in susceptible and resistant rice, respectively, such as scp-like extracellular protein pr1a , pr1b , chitinase family protein pr <dig> , wound-induced protein pr4b , pr <dig> , and pathogenesis-related betv <dig> family protein pr10a  . however, the number of degs in resistant rice was lower than in susceptible rice . herbivore-induced callose deposition on the sieve plates of rice is an important mechanism for host resistance. β- <dig>  glucan hydrolase genes are activated and cause unplugging of the sieve tube occlusions in susceptible plants  <cit> . the majority of this gene family were upregulated in susceptible and resistant rice, such as gns <dig> , gns <dig> , and gns <dig> , but the number of degs was lower in resistant rice . in total,  <dig> of  <dig> protein synthesis, protein targeting, and protein folding related genes were downregulated in susceptible rice, but only  <dig> were downregulated in resistant rice . thus, the reprogramming of protein synthesis and secretion machinery was significantly affected in the susceptible lines but not in the resistant lines, which was suggestive of significant damage in susceptible rice.

degs assigned to photosynthesis , tricarboxylic acid cycle , mitochondrial electron transport/atp synthesis, major carbohydrate  metabolism and lipid metabolism were highly downregulated in susceptible rice. however, these genes had low amplitude of variation in resistant rice . so, these genes were upregulated in resistant rice as compared between with those in suseptible rice . the ps comprised genes coding for proteins involved in the photosynthetic electron transport chain, photorespiration, calvin cycle, and photosystem i and ii complexes. we observed a general downregulation of genes associated with photosynthetic processes at  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai in both susceptible and resistant rice, but with a higher number of degs in susceptible genotype at  <dig> hai. bph response included genes involved in the primary metabolism, mainly related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. these genes were predominantly downregulated in susceptible rice after bph infestation, but the carbohydrate degradation genes were upregulated . our data indicated that bph attack generally represses photosynthesis-related genes in susceptible rice leaves, as well as those involved in primary metabolism.figure  <dig>

bph-responsive transcript profiles are distinct in early and late feeding stages of two rice genotypes
as shown in figure  <dig>  the number of degs at  <dig> hai was less than  <dig> hai in both the resistant and susceptible rice. this demonstrated that both rice genotypes experienced weak damage in the early stages of bph feeding, and resistant rice showed a relatively normal physiological status compared to susceptible rice. in addition, the amplitude of variation at  <dig> hai was less than that at  <dig> hai in both rice genotypes .

to understand key biological processes involved in the rice response to bph, we used singular enrichment analysis of agrigo to identify enriched go terms. all compared degs showed significant go terms, excluding s0_r <dig> and s6_r <dig> . as a result,  <dig> significant go terms were found in total degs in susceptible line ,  <dig> in resistant line , and  <dig> in comparison of the two lines  . investigation of the rice transcriptome following bph feeding revealed the activation of a wide and complex response, and the transcriptional reconfiguration involved a broad range of biological processes. the  <dig> go terms were mainly distributed in several categories, including photosynthesis, primary metabolism, secondary metabolism, response to stimulus, cell wall, and ribosome. go terms of important biological functions were compared for significance in early and late feeding stages of two rice genotypes . common go terms significant in all comparisons and unions were response to stimulus, response to abiotic stimulus, response to stress, cell wall, plastid, and thylakoid. the  <dig> hai-specific go terms were response to biotic stimulus, photosynthesis, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, ribosome, and intracellular organelle. several go terms, including macromolecule biosynthetic process, translation, gene expression, secondary metabolic process, and biosynthetic process, were significant only in  <dig> hai-susceptible rice and the corresponding s48_r <dig>  all go terms were significant in  <dig> hai-susceptible rice, and showed smaller p-values. overall, during bph infestation, the most rapid gene expression adjustments were observed in the categories of response to stimulus and cell wall; the degs involved in photosynthesis, response to biotic stimulus, and ribosome gradually increased and became significant at late feeding stage.table  <dig>

common defense-related genes in two rice genotypes
receptor kinase, kinase cascades, and ca2+ signaling-related genes are important components of signal transduction and play roles in transmitting resistance signals to downstream response genes  <cit> . twenty and nine receptor kinases in susceptible and resistant rice were upregulated, respectively . this included lrr family protein receptor-like protein kinase  <dig> , brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  <dig> precursor bak <dig> , and receptor kinase xa <dig>  . these upregulated receptor kinase genes suggested that signal perception was activated after bph feeding. the intracellular concentration of ca2+, an important second messenger, typically increases in response to biotic or abiotic stress. in our studies, the majority of ca2+ signaling-related genes were upregulated, such as calmodulin-related calcium sensor protein oscml <dig>  and calmodulin-binding protein  , which suggests that the rice defense response to bph involved ca2+ influx. two map kinase genes loc_os03g <dig> and loc_os06g <dig> were upregulated . protein posttranslational modification genes were also upregulated, such as cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase crk <dig> , crk <dig> , calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinases , serine/threonine protein kinase , and protein phosphatase  . crk <dig> and crk <dig> were detected based on a proteomic approach to evaluate bph15
 <cit> . these upregulated genes suggest that a resistance signal is transmitted to downstream regulatory networks after rice perceives bph.

transcription factors  play an important role in the defense response  <cit> . we detected approximately  <dig> tf degs in two rice genotypes, and more were found in susceptible rice than resistant rice . erebp binds to the gcc box, a conserved ethylene responsive promoter element found in many defense-related genes  <cit> . a systematic expression analysis of rice wrky revealed a large number of wrky dna-binding proteins involved in the transcriptional activation of defense-related genes in response to rice pathogens  <cit> . overexpression of the oswrky <dig> gene enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus and white-backed planthopper  <cit> .

protein degradation-related genes were upregulated in both rice genotypes . the protein degradation system is thought to be responsible for selective degradation of proteins folded incorrectly as a result of stress  <cit> . in response to abiotic stress, wound-responsive proteins wi <dig>  were upregulated. wound-response pathways were also detected in bph-feeding rice  <cit> . eight bowman–birk-type bran trypsin inhibitor precursor genes play a role in resistance to bph in bph14-containing rice  <cit> , and we also found that they were upregulated in this research .

candidate genes of bph15
we searched for expressed genes within the  <dig> genes predicted in the 580-kb bph <dig> region using rna sequencing data of resistant rice. we identified five jacalin-related lectins  and two lrr family proteins  , most of which showed higher fpkm values than other predicted genes. these genes had similar fpkm values and their expression levels were not significantly different at three time points . these genes were examined using reverse transcription-pcr , and we found that four jacalin-related lectins  and a lrr family protein  were constitutively expressed in resistant rice before and after bph feeding . other functional genes , which were only detected in a few raw fragments , were not detected in rt-pcr. the majority of transposon protein and retrotransposon protein predicted genes were also detected in a few raw fragments. we then detected all potentially expressed genes  and found that no other genes were expressed. note that the four jacalin-related lectin genes showed similar blastp results in the nipponbare genome, and the corresponding gene loc_os04g <dig> also contained a jacalin domain. however, the gene was annotated as an en/spm subclass transposon protein in the msu rice genome annotation project release  <dig>  . we inferred that these orthologous genes originated from the same ancestral gene . the lrr protein f <dig> expressed in resistant rice corresponded to loc_os04g <dig>  which also predicted as a lrr gene. based on these results, the candidate gene bph <dig> represents one or a few of these expressed genes, which is being verified based on complementation tests.

discussion
the wild relatives of crops contain numerous genes of economic importance that are critical for genetic improvement of crops and understanding the mechanism of traits under control by these genes  <cit> . the use of genes from wild relatives to improve crop performance is well established  <cit> . genetic improvement of crop plants by developing introgressed lines originating in wild relatives usually results in a reduction in recombination rates within introgressed segments  <cit> . by using molecular markers, a lot of introgression of chromosome segments from o. officinalis to o. sativa had been observed , though the mechanism of introgression is poorly understood. important traits such as insect and disease resistance have been transferred into cultivated rice  <cit> . bph resistance gene bph <dig> was introgressed from wild rice o. officinalis
 <cit> . in this study, bph <dig> was located in a recombination cold spot, which is similar to the powdery mildew resistance gene mla in barley  <cit> .

the c genome of o. officinalis is estimated to be 651 mb, which is larger than the 430 mb of the a genome of cultivated rice o. sativa. this 580-kb region of bph <dig>  which contains numerous repeat sequences, in the resistant rice genome corresponds to the 210-kb fragment in the nipponbare genome. excluding several functional genes , the sequences in this region of the two genotypes are highly diverse. more te-related genes appear in the bph <dig> region of resistant rice than in the corresponding region of nipponbare . the important roles of retrotransposons to modify genome size, remodel genome structure, and displace gene functions in the plant genome have been observed in several studies, which indicates that retrotransposons are an important driving force in genome evolution  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that retroelement insertions contributed to the c genome expansion of o. officinalis
 <cit>  , which might cause divergence in the bph <dig> region between o. officinalis and o. sativa. the diversity in the intergenic, repetitive dna regions should be responsible for the low chromosome pairing and recombination between o. sativa and o. officinalis
 <cit> . in this experiment, introgression of the highly diverse 580-kb segment is the primary cause of the low recombinant rate, making it difficult to isolate the bph <dig> gene using positional cloning. these difficulties were also encountered in other processes of gene cloning. the recombination repression of nematode resistance gene mi was also thought to be a consequence of the alien origin of the dna segment  <cit> . another reason for suppressed recombination in the bph <dig> region is that the locus is located near the centromere. a study found that chromosomal recombination at the centromere core and surrounding regions on six chromosomes was completely suppressed  <cit> , and a substantial reduction in recombination was observed in the regions of the short arm and the pericentromeric region of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

we also observed a recombination hot spot located just outside the bph <dig> segment, where the local recombination rate is much higher than the whole genome average value in the bc2f <dig> family. recombination hot spots in many species show significant relationships with gene density, gc content, and specific gene functional categories  <cit> . the  <dig> -kb recombination hot-spot between markers t <dig> and 20m <dig>  located just on the right side of the 580-kb replacement fragment, shows average base composition of the overall chromosome . based on these observations, the recombination hot-spot region showed no correlation with its base properties but position . this is important for future studies on the position relationship between recombination hot spots and cold spots to analyze the mechanism of activation and inactivation of recombination.

identifying candidate genes in an uncharacterized genomic region with no recombination is difficult. in our study, bac clone sequencing of the bph <dig> region and deep rna sequencing of resistant rice were combined to analyze candidate resistance genes. eighty-seven genes annotated in this 580-kb region exist between marker g12140- <dig> and t <dig>  and most of them are te-related genes. moreover, only four jacalin-related lectins and a lrr domain protein were expressed in the resistant rice. many plant lectins have anti-insect potential, some have strong insecticidal properties. transgenic rice plants expressing lectins showed resistance to bph and other insects  <cit> . hessian fly-responsive gene  <dig>  is a novel jacalin-like lectin gene from wheat  plants that responds to infestation by hessian fly  larvae  <cit> . lectins, are also known to play important roles in defense responses against pathogens. a jacalin-related lectin-like gene  in wheat is a component of the plant defense system  <cit> . the mannose-binding lectin gene cambl <dig> from pepper plays a key role in the regulation of plant cell death and defense responses through the induction of downstream defense-related genes and sa accumulation after the recognition of microbial pathogens  <cit> . some lectin receptor-like kinases have been implicated in rice resistance to pathogens and herbivores  <cit> . as the four jacalin-related lectin genes in the bph <dig> region expressed in the resistant rice, we speculated that one or multiple of these lectin genes are bph <dig> candidates and function in resistance to bph. the jacalin-related lectin genes clustered in bph <dig> region might evolve from ancient duplications driven by te elements, as what has been shown in other resistance gene evolution in plant  <cit> . another candidate gene is the lrr domain protein in the bph <dig> region. the majority of resistance  genes that have been cloned belong to the nb-lrr family and the first cloned bph-resistance gene bph <dig> is a nb-lrr member  <cit> . therefore, the five candidate genes are currently being verified using complementation tests.

rna sequencing of the bph <dig> introgression line and the susceptible recipient line provided transcriptome data on the mechanism of resistance conferred by bph <dig>  in our study, several rice genes have been associated with the bph response for the first time, which provides information on signal transduction pathways and defense responses elicited by the bph in rice. we analyzed plants at  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai, before the development of visible symptoms, and compared the expression profiles between early and late stages of infestation. the bph extracts large volumes of phloem sap to attain adequate sugar, which should influence expression of genes involved in carbon assimilation and mobilization. the transcriptional downregulation of photosynthetic and primary metabolism related genes appears to be a universal adaptive response of plants to phloem-feeding insects and represents a shift in resource allocation from growth to basal defense  <cit> . in susceptible rice, bph can significantly reduce photosynthetic rates in host plants, but resistant plants show few symptoms of damage and grow normally after 2 days of feeding  <cit> . in this experiment, photosynthesis, tca, cho metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein synthesis related genes were downregulated in susceptible rice. however, resistant rice containing bph <dig> shows lower expression changes, suggesting that the resistant rice has a stronger tolerance than susceptible rice. the early stage and late stage showed significantly different expression profiles. the majority of degs show a less significant change and fewer degs are observed at  <dig> hai, which may be due to minor damage during the short bph feeding time. significant go terms of photosynthesis, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, ribosome, and intracellular organelle only appeared during the late stages. previous comparative analyses of expression profiles of proteins in bph <dig> rice leaf sheaths in response to infestation by the bph found that in response to stress caused by pest invasion, plants develop a basal defense, which appeared stronger in the susceptible lines compared with resistant lines  <cit> . in this report, the amplitude of variation in resistance rice was lower than that in susceptible rice , in which the upregulated genes in susceptible rice may function as a basal defense. the majority of upregulated ethylene signals, receptor kinases, biotic response pr genes, and transcription factor genes in susceptible rice showed larger fold-changes than in resistant rice . bph <dig> and mi- <dig> both activate an sa-dependent resistance pathway after bph and nematode feeding  <cit> . however, the sa pathway may not be present in the bph <dig> resistance mechanism according to our sequencing data and sa content measured using gc-ms. the key defense mechanism found in our study was related to jasmonate signaling, ethylene signaling, receptor kinase, mapk cascades, ca2+ signaling, pr genes, tfs, and protein posttranslational modifications. receptor kinase xa <dig>  was upregulated only in resistant rice . these exclusively upregulated degs in resistant rice increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism of resistance in bph <dig>  in addition, the candidate genes  may participate in the unique defense mechanism of bph <dig>  these lectin proteins may have insecticidal properties or deterrent activity to the bph. the jrl and lrr genes may also perceive bph feeding as a receptor to transduce defense signals to downstream genes. however, this hypothesis requires further confirmation and candidate gene complementation tests.

CONCLUSIONS
the bph-resistance gene bph <dig> was mapped to a recombination cold-spot region. the high level of sequence diversity in the bph <dig> region explained the heavy suppression of recombination in this region. we found that bph-responsive transcript profiles were distinct between resistant and susceptible plants and between the early stage and late stage. susceptible rice showed more degs and larger amplitude of variation than resistant rice after bph feeding. more genes were regulated at the late stage than those at the early stage. the key defense mechanism in resistant bph <dig> and susceptible recipient rice was related to jasmonate signaling, ethylene signaling, receptor kinase, mapk cascades, ca2+ signaling, pr genes, transcription factors, and protein posttranslational modifications. four jacalin-related lectin proteins genes and one lrr protein gene predicted in the bph <dig> region were expressed constitutively and considered candidate bph <dig> genes. these results increase our understanding of plant–insect interactions and can be used to protect against this destructive agricultural pest.
