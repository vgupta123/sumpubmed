BACKGROUND
a crucial challenge of the proteome era is to use the genome information for a better understanding of protein expression, protein cellular distribution and functionality discovery not only in normal but also in pathological processes  <cit> . antibody development against every human protein is a prerequisite to improve this knowledge. several high-throughput alternatives have been developed to generate antibodies to the entire proteome  <cit> . the human protein atlas initiative   <cit> , the sanger institute antibody atlas database, the nci clinical proteomics  <cit> , the hupo human antibody initiative   <cit> , and several eu-funded consortia  are all good examples of these alternatives.

the production of mabs and/or rabbit antibodies requires large amounts of antigens, it is time-consuming due to the immunization step of the animals and, in the case of mabs, the screening and clone selection can take from  <dig> months to  <dig> year  <cit> .the development of recombinant antibodies in single-chain fv  formats is a good alternative to obtain high-affinity antibodies against any target without time-consuming immunization  <cit> . the affinity of scfvs for their targets might be comparable to that of mabs or pabs and in some cases even higher  <cit> . as a general rule, scfvs possess several advantages in comparison to igg or fabs such as higher tissue penetrance and more rapid clarification  <cit> . moreover, antibody phage display, m13-based human libraries, is becoming particularly useful for the production and development of antibodies for immunotherapy in different diseases  <cit> . in vitro phage display pipelines have been setup to generate antibodies to the complete human proteome, but the selections are still carried out manually  <cit> . screening of phage display antibody libraries is constrained by the necessity of having considerable amounts of antigen, at least  <dig> - <dig>  mg of protein for the whole procedure .

the necessity of having significant amounts of the purified target protein, not only for production and selection but also for the screening of antibodies, is one of the main problems to develop antibodies, and constitutes a major bottleneck associated to all three alternatives above described  <cit> . despite progress in automation, protein expression is a limiting step to get toxic, difficult-to-express or membrane proteins. rapid, efficient, and cost-effective protein expression and purification strategies are required for the production of antibodies against any target, trying to minimize at the same time, the amount of required protein.

cell-free expression is a powerful and flexible technology. new advances in this technology have faced the higher demand for high-throughput protein synthesis. these advances include the use of cell-extracts from different backgrounds , modulation of the reducing environment for the correct production of disulfide bonds, incorporation of detergents, lipid bilayers or other non-lipoprotein particles for the expression of membrane proteins and, finally, the automation of the procedure  <cit> . furthermore, cell-free systems offer several advantages over traditional cell-based expression methods, which include lower sensitivity to product toxicity and suitability for high-throughput strategies, because of reduced reaction volumes and processing time. recent improvements in translation efficiency have resulted in yields comparable to cell-based expression systems for difficult-to-express proteins  <cit> .

bacterial, wheat germ and reticulocyte lysates have been used as in vitro expression systems in a wide variety of strategies  <cit> . rapid translation system   <cit> , a bacterial-based commercially available cell-free protein expression system, has been used for the high-throughput expression of inner and outer membrane proteins from anaplasma marginale  <cit> . in  <dig>  the riken structural genomics initiative  reported the bacterial based cell-free protein expression production of about 25% of randomly chosen mouse cdna clones with yields higher than  <dig>  mg/ml  <cit> . since then, several developments have significantly improved the yield of in vitro expressed proteins in the range of milligrams of protein per ml of reaction mix  <cit> . another interesting initiative is the "human protein factory", for the expression of human proteins using the wheat-germ in vitro protein expression system and gateway technology  <cit> . the authors reported a 97% success rate of protein expression over  <dig> human proteins. among them, they detected soluble proteins in  <dig> out of  <dig> clones  <cit> . there have been other successful high-throughput initiatives based on in vitro protein expression, with yields up to  <dig> mg/ml, which have been applied for protein arrays, nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallization studies  <cit> .

regarding the use of low amounts of protein, the microarray format is particularly useful for low consumption and automation. antibody arrays were initially designed to capture and detect simultaneously multiple analytes with high affinity and selectivity in human biological samples  in order to study variations between biological statuses  <cit> . we have explored the use of this proteomic technique for testing scfv antibody libraries against different antigens at the same time in order to identify specific scfvs, increasing the throughput of the screening step with minimal requirements of protein. in this report, we propose a novel methodology to develop scfv antibodies using human phage display antibody libraries in a short time  with only  <dig> μg of protein. furthermore, this method could be automated in a high-throughput format to obtain "antibodies on demand" against any target, taking advantage of cell-free protein expression, antibody phage display and scfv antibody microarrays.

RESULTS
production of human scfvs against cell-free expressed antigens
the cdnas-encoding gfp and trx were cloned into pivex and pet32b plasmids, respectively, and used for the in vitro transcription/translation reactions. the cell-free expression yielded between 5- <dig> μg of purified protein per  <dig> μl rts reaction. the purity and homogeneity of the expressed proteins were confirmed by sds-page and western blot using  <dig> μl of rts reaction .

proteins were immobilized on the talon™ magnetic beads and used to get antibodies by phage display. after extensive washing with pbs, talon dynabeads® were divided in five tubes containing  <dig> μl of beads, one for each of the four rounds of selection with the libraries and the fifth one for alexa fluor 647-protein labelling. a remarkable phage enrichment for both proteins was observed by elisa after  <dig> or  <dig> rounds of biopanning .

scfv antibody microarray preparation
a total of  <dig> scfvs from each specific antigen selection were recovered from the 3rd and 4th round of selection, purified from the periplasmic fraction of hb <dig> e. coli cells and directly printed in duplicate onto fast nitrocellulose slides  <cit> . although some scfv expression differences were observed among the different clones, a correct printing pattern was detected, indicating adequate printing conditions . the amount of scfv printed in the array was determined by printing serial 1: <dig> dilutions of previously reported anti-gastrin ta <dig> scfv at  <dig>  μg/ml to construct a regression line  <cit> . then, we used the median of the fluorescence signal of the scfvs in the regression line to get the amount of scfvs printed in the array. approximately  <dig> pg of antibodies were printed in each spot of the array. the quality of the scfv antibody microarray was confirmed by the absence of cross contamination between successive spots. all positive controls as well as buffer spots showed the correct reactivity. the intra-assay reproducibility was assessed by comparing the results between the two replicas printed within the same chip for each clone and gave an r <dig> =  <dig>  .

evaluation of specific scfvs in microarray format
evaluation of specific scfvs against gfp and trx was performed by using scfv antibody microarrays. cell-free expressed and purified gfp and trx proteins were directly labeled with 647alexa fluor at  <dig> μg/ml to be probed in the antibody microarrays . in our microarrays,  <dig> recombinant scfvs were simultaneously tested. the scfvs obtained against each other antigen were also used as controls for the selection of highly-specific scfvs that did not show cross-reactivity to other antigen .

to test the reproducibility and selectivity of the system, we used also gfp and trx proteins expressed in e.coli, followed by a fluorescent labelled antibody . although signal intensity was usually stronger and background fluorescence was lower for the e. coli-derived proteins, a similar reactivity pattern was observed for the cell-free alexa647-labeled purified protein  or the e. coli-expressed gfp and trx , indicating an adequate performance of the expression system and the microarray screening.

to check the effect of a potential scfv denaturation during printing and to demonstrate the utility of the screening by antibody microarrays, we tested all the scfv binders for each antigen by elisa. a comparable number of scfv binders were found by elisa and by antibody microarrays. by antibody microarrays, we found  <dig> gfp-specific scfvs with 3-fold higher signals than the negative controls . by elisa, we found  <dig> scfvs with at least 2-fold higher signals than the negative controls , obtaining a 62% of coincidence  between elisa and antibody microarray. regarding trx scfv binders, we found by elisa  <dig> scfvs with 2-fold higher signals than the negative controls . by antibody microarrays  we also found  <dig> trx-specific scfvs with 3-fold higher signals than the negative controls . indeed, we were able to detect  <dig> trx scfv binders by both techniques, with a 75% coincidence between both techniques. collectively, these data support the use of antibody microarray screening to identify highly-specific scfv antibodies as an alternative to conventional elisa.

characterization of the selected scfvs
to confirm the value of the scfvs obtained by antibody microarray screening, we characterized the three scfvs showing strongest reactivity against each in vitro-expressed antigen. these scfvs were tested by elisa to compare their reactivity against the in vitro-expressed proteins and the e. coli-expressed proteins. the results were similar for the three anti-gfp scfvs  . the two scfvs that showed strong recognition by antibody microarrays were also the best for elisa. however, although trx-a <dig> and trx-e <dig> worked well in both assays , trx-e <dig> scfv showed a lower correlation between antibody microarrays and elisa values.

the  <dig> scfvs selected  recognised their target proteins by western blot analysis, without cross-reactivity . indeed, most of the scfvs were able to detect as low as  <dig>  ng of protein by western-blot, indicating the suitability of the scfvs for this technique. indeed, trx-a <dig> and trx-e <dig> only showed 2- <dig> times lower sensitivity to trx than m <dig> mab to the flag epitope . finally, the six scfvs were sequenced. all the scfvs-encoding dna sequences were different . the scfvs displayed significant variability not only in the cdrs but also in the framework as a consequence of the naïve origin of the mehta libraries.

discussion
antibodies are used to study protein expression and localization within a tissue, cell or organelle, protein-protein interactions or protein function  <cit> . moreover, antibodies have multiple clinical uses for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases  <cit> .

to study and characterize the human proteome, it is necessary to establish high-throughput methodologies for testing multiple antibodies against different proteins  <cit> . here, we propose a new methodology to raise antibodies to any potential protein target: "antibodies on demand". this is a fast method to obtain recombinant human monoclonal antibodies against any antigen. only  <dig> μg of protein were necessary to perform the whole procedure, since we took advantage of methodologies that require minimal amounts of protein: i) in vitro protein expression and purification, ii) antibody phage display and iii) scfv antibody microarray screening.

this approach avoids the production of considerable amounts of protein necessary for both, the immunization and the screening steps, which usually are the bottlenecks for antibody development. in our hands, a dedicated person could produce antibodies in about  <dig> weeks, calculating  <dig> working days per week: i)  <dig> days for amplification, dna purification and in vitro protein expression and purification by talon™ dynabeads®, ii)  <dig> days for three-four rounds of biopanning by phage display and e. coli amplification, iii) 3- <dig> days for printing and screening of scfv antibody microarrays and iv) 3- <dig> days for production and verification of the scfv results .

this methodology could be adapted to a high-throughput system. indeed, all the techniques used in this report have been previously adapted to high-throughput assays  <cit> . one main advantage of our approach relies on the utilization of in vitro bacterial cell-free expression. different reports support this expression strategy, because yields as low as  <dig> μg of protein were enough to get antibodies. proteins with recovery yields below this amount could be scaled up in vitro as much as necessary to obtain the  <dig> μg of protein required for this approach.

initially, cell-free expression was restricted by several limitations, especially for the expression of transmembrane proteins or proteins rich in disulfide bonds. however, advances in the in vitro technology have minimized these limitations by including several components, like canine pancreatic microsomal membranes, different dtt ratios and protein disulfide isomerase for the correct folding and production of proteins presenting disulfide bonds or different detergents and lipid bilayers for the expression of membrane proteins  <cit> .

the microarray format for antibody screening shows different advantages: i) consumes minimal amounts of proteins, ii) is very sensitive, iii) improves the specificity, and iv) is suitable for high-throughput screening of antibodies. at the same time that we identified a recombinant antibody to a particular protein, a global-binding profile is simultaneously generated because different antibodies produced against different proteins are printed in the same array, permitting the selection of only highly specific, non cross-reactive antibodies. with our microarray settings, we could print up to  <dig> spots in a high-density antibody format per slide. since, only  <dig> scfvs were tested in duplicate per antigen, we could significantly increase the multiplexing of this methodology by testing antibodies against  <dig> targets simultaneously in the same slide.

moreover, the use of recombinant antibodies in microarray format did not alter significantly scfvs binding properties after printing. it has been described that only a fraction of antibodies work well after printing on the surface of microarrays, due to the loss of activity by denaturation or degradation during printing and array storage. to explore the fact that we could have been losing 60-80% of total scfvs due to denaturation in our antibody microarrays  <cit> , we decided to test all the scfvs by elisa to compare the performance of the microarray and verify the usefulness of antibody microarrays for identification of scfv binders. interestingly, we were able to identify a similar number of scfv binders by both screenings with a coincidence of  <dig> and 75% for gfp and trx, respectively. these data support the utilization of antibody microarrays for the screening step, while consuming only  <dig>  μg of  <dig> alexafluor protein.

remarkably, scfvs were prepared by using a naïve scfv phage display library displaying multiple scaffolds , avoiding the use of scfv antibody libraries specifically designed for antibody microarrays, which usually possess one fixed scaffold  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new and fast method to produce scfv antibodies by using only  <dig> μg of cell-free expressed protein and a naive scfv antibody library in combination with an antibody microarray format for screening. the scfvs were useful for different applications . this antibody production technology could be especially applicable to "difficult-to-express" or toxic proteins, or when the amount of available protein might be a limiting step.
